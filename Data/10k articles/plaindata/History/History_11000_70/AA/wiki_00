It is considered part of the Classical era, epoch, or historical period.\nThis century marked the height of Classical Greek civilization in all of its aspects. By the year 400 Greek philosophy, art, literature and architecture had spread far and wide, with the numerous independent Greek colonies that had sprung up throughout the lands of the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nArguably the most important series of political events in this period were the conquests of Alexander, bringing about the collapse of the once formidable Persian Empire and spreading Greek culture far into the east. Alexander dreamed of an east/west union, but when his short life ended, his vast empire was plunged into civil war as his generals each carved out their own separate kingdoms. Thus began the Hellenistic age, a period characterized by a more absolute approach to rule, with Greek kings taking on royal trappings and setting up hereditary successions. While a degree of democracy still existed in some of the remaining independent Greek cities, many scholars see this age as marking the end of classical Greece.\n\nIn India, the Mauryan Empire was founded in 322 BC by the Nanda Dynasty and rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India, taking advantage of the disruptions of local powers in the wake of the withdrawal westward by the armies of Alexander.\n\nChina in the 4th century BC entered an era of constant warfare known as the Warring States period. The period saw the rapid rise of large states (such as Chu) over smaller ones thanks to technological advancement. Though the period has usually been characterized by historians as being excessively violent compared to the Spring and Autumn period it was also punctured by several cultural and social growth through the expansion of several different sects of Confucianism and Taoism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee: List of sovereign states in the 4th century BC.\n"}

It is an example of pseudoscience or pseudoarchaeology that employs contrived calculations involving many free parameters to achieve an impressive-looking result.\n\nThe word \"archaeocryptography\" is derived from \"archaeology\", which is the study of human activity in the past, and \"cryptography\", which is the study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties.\n\nArchaeocryptologists try to find underlying correlations in respect that which is being studied or decoded. Some factors taken into consideration while deciphering an object, structure or megalithic monument can include the features such as faces, stairs, sides, and terraces. The geolocation or mathematical operations are performed on latitude and longitude coordinates as well as astronomical alignments, such as are found with archaeoastronomy. The incorporation of grids, the use of numerical ordering, mathematical constants, Biblical gematria, and any other re-occurring number that might stand out from the decoding process are determining factors.\n\nArchaeocryptologists then can use different mathematical formulas to find correlations within that which is being studied or between other monuments or structures that share any underlying factors. Popular examples are the Orion correlation theory between the Giza pyramid complex and the three middle stars of the constellation Orion, and also theories about the region of Cydonia on Mars.\n\nThe coining of the word \"archaeocryptography\" is often attributed to Carl P. Munck, who after retiring from the United States military in the late 1970s began studying cartographic material, among other topics, trying to search for better answers as to why certain megalithic monument exist. This led him to a formula he believes architects used to place and design various megalithic monuments. Munck's theory claims that calculations using selected numbers or dimensions found in megalithic monuments or Egyptian pyramids yield the latitude or longitude of the site. However, in Munck's findings, the prime meridian does not run through Greenwich, but through the Great Pyramid in Giza. His theory is known simply as \"The Code\" and asserts that an ancient Jewish numerological system known as gematria is used in the manipulation of numbers to other key locations, mathematical components and positions of sights in the geometry of their construction.\n\nThe theory later become popularized and among other practitioners and researchers in pseudo-scientific fields, such as Michael Lawrence Morton, Richard C. Hoagland, Bruce Cathie, and Hugh Harleston Jr. They adapted archaeocryptography to their own studies, developing different theories and books based on the topic.\n\nThe marginal, or even fictional, status of archaeocryptography was suggested in Zachary Mason's novel \"The Lost Books of the Odyssey\", which purports to be a collection of lost works which the author describes as being as old as the Odyssey and which he claims to have decoded from a manuscript he had uncovered. In the author's biography at the conclusion of the book he describes himself as \"the John Shade Professor of Archaeocryptography and Paleomathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford\". The \"lost books\" were actually written by Mason and, as reviewers have noted, Mason is a novelist and computer scientist who lives in California, John Shade is a fictional poet in Vladimir Nabokov's \"Pale Fire\", and no such professorship exists.\n\n"}

Her father was a bar owner, and her mother a homemaker.\n\nRaven earned an Artium Baccalaureatus from Hood College in Maryland in 1965, then went on to complete graduate study. She earned an MFA in painting from George Washington University and completed a PhD in art history from Johns Hopkins University in 1975.\n\nRaven was a major figure in the Feminist Art Movement and was part of an effort to educate women artists and provide them with opportunities to make and show work that was specifically about their experiences as women. In 1973, Raven co-founded the Feminist Studio Workshop with Judy Chicago and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville. The goal of the Feminist Studio Workshop, an independent art school ultimately housed in the Los Angeles Woman's Building, was to \"come together as a community of working individuals whose work grows out of our shared experiences as women and our shared social context,\" and an emphasis was put on \"cooperation, collaboration, and sisterhood.\" That same year, Raven co-founded The Center for Feminist Art Historical Studies with fellow Johns Hopkins-educated art historian Ruth Iskin. The Center was dedicated to serious research on women artists, developing a feminist art historical methodology, and creating a slide archive of work by women. Raven also co-founded and edited the women's culture magazine \"Chrysalis.\" In 1976, she was a founding member of The Lesbian Art Project; she herself was a lesbian as well. Members explored lesbianism through artwork, researched lesbian artists of the past, such as the painter Romaine Brooks, and questioned the cultural meaning of the very term \"lesbian.\" She was also a founder of the Women’s Caucus for Art.\n\nIn addition to the Feminist Studio Workshop, Raven also taught at the California Institute of the Arts, Maryland Institute College of Art, Parsons The New School for Design, UCLA, University of Southern California and The New School for Social Research.

Now a significant tourist attraction, the building is located in a little street off the Plaza San Jacinto, a block east of the Plaza Bolívar. It is one of only a few houses from the colonial era which survive in central Caracas.\n\nOne of the adjacent buildings serves as a Bolivarian museum (\"museo bolivariano\"). The birthplace and museum together present memorabilia connected with Bolivar and the Venezuelan War of Independence, along with weapons and furniture of that period.\n\nThe house on San Jacinto Street was completed in the 1640s. \nBolivar was born to Doña María de la Concepción Palacios y Blanco and Coronel Don Juan Vicente Bolívar y Ponte in the bedroom here on 24 July 1783, and was the fourth child of the aristocratic couple of the Creole family who had migrated from Spain 200 years earlier. In 1806, the house was sold to a relation of Bolívar called Madriz. The house remained in his family until 1876 when it was bought by President Antonio Guzmán Blanco. Guzmán Blanco was an admirer of Bolívar, and erected his equestrian statue in the Plaza Bolivar.\n\nReconstruction of the house was ordered on October 28, 1916, with the purpose of preserving Venezuela's cultural heritage, and to honor its national hero, but it was not until 1920 when the house actually underwent reconstruction with added refinements.\nIt was inaugurated on 5 January 1921 on the anniversary of the Battle of Carabobo.\nThe building became a listed National Monument on 25 July 2002.\n\nThe single-storey building occupies a relatively narrow plot, 23 meters wide and 60 meters deep. It has wide corridors and courtyards and patios. \n\nThe reconstruction is Spanish Colonial in character, but the aim of the restorers was to enhance the building, rather than adopt criteria of strict authenticity. New materials were introduced; for example the facade facing the street has been refaced in stone, which is atypical of colonial-era houses in Venezuela. Other walls are whitewashed: the structure underneath is now made of brick, although it was probably made of adobe originally.\n\nAt the time of Bolívar's birth, the home was opulently furnished with mahogany chests and tables, upholstered chairs, decorated mirrors; damask curtains, gold cornices, and bright chandeliers. Period furniture and artifacts belonging to Bolívar can now be seen in the building. The house has a sequence of courtyards surrounded by corridors and rooms. In the main courtyard is the baptismal font used for Bolívar's baptism, originally located in Caracas Cathedral. The second courtyard serves as ventilation to the kitchen and other rooms, and includes a replica of a water fountain from the time of Bolívar. At the end of the house is a small pen-laundry and stable.\n\nAmong those which stand out are the main room, the bedroom (site where Simón Bolívar was born) and the cabinet, which occupy the front body of the building. They are decorated with murals executed by the painter Tito Salas. These very large paintings by Salas depict Bolívar's heroic battles and scenes during his life. In one painting at the house, Salas depicts Bolívar on a white mountain with a white bearded man with angel wings. There are also paintings of his life scenes by Martín Tovar y Tovar and Arturo Michelena, including his christening, wedding and death. There is also a tree in the backyard of the house, which is famous as it is said to be the location where Simon was taught by Rodríguez.\n\nBolivar’s childhood mementos such as his library and personal records are also exhibited.\n\nDespite the Venezuelan authorities' assertion that Bolívar was born in Caracas, there have been claims that the much poorer town of San Mateo, Aragua, was in fact his true birthplace. The claims are based on the fact that Bolívar's mother had certainly been living at the San Mateo ranch shortly before his birth and that as a child, Bolívar spent much of his time there.\n\nThere is also another family home of Bolivar which has historical importance. It was the venue where the independence movement was launched on 19 April 1810 after the freedom fighters had conspired to act during their first meeting at this home in 1818. Eventually, as result of this movement Venezuela got its independence from Spain, on 5 July 1815.\n\n\n"}

It was also known by the abbreviation B & C.\n\nThe British and Colonial Kinematograph Company was formed in 1908 by Albert Henry (\"Bert\") Bloomfield (c.1882–1933) and John Benjamin (\"Mac\") McDowell (1878–1954). At first it operated from a rented basement in central London, using a single camera and developing the negatives in McDowell's house, but soon moved to studios at Newstead House in East Finchley, London.\n\nIt developed a reputation for both documentaries and feature films, notably the \"Lieutenant Daring\" series, featuring Percy Morgan, and the \"Dick Turpin and Don Q\" films. By 1912 it had begun making longer films, such as \"Robin Hood Outlawed\", and using location footage, some shot by Fred Burlingham. It also covered important news stories such as the funeral of Edward VII and the Coronation of George V, as well as major sporting fixtures. In 1910 the company made a film of the Canadian Pacific Railway and, in 1912, filmed the F.A. Cup Final and the Derby, as well as in Jamaica.\n\nIn 1913, after Bloomfield had left the company, the studio made what has been cited as \"the first British epic film\", \"The Battle of Waterloo\". This was filmed by director Charles Weston at Irthlingborough in Northamptonshire. It was made \"less as a drama and rather more as a recreation of historic actuality\" and contained \"elaborately recreated scenes... from the point of view of an ordinary soldier in the thick of the battle\". It was nearly an hour and a half long – much longer than most others of the period – and was filmed using hundreds of extras, in five days, at a cost of £1,800, most of which McDowell raised by remortgaging the company. McDowell sold the British rights for £5,000, and raised even more from overseas rights. Two reels and a further fragment, representing roughly half of the film, are now preserved in the BFI National Archive. A parody of the film, \"The Adventures of Pimple: The Battle of Waterloo\", written and produced by Fred and Joe Evans, was produced and released within a month of the original film. In 1919, the director of \"The Battle of Waterloo\", Charles Weston, jumped to his death from the 18th floor of the Aeolian Building in New York City.\n\nThe company moved to new studios in a converted ice skating rink in Walthamstow in 1913. For a time, it employed the exiled American director James Young Deer. In 1915, the company was one of several to take over British filming on the Western Front, later releasing footage as \"The Battle of the Somme\".\n\nThe company filmed \"The Life of Shakespeare\" (1914), and two versions of \"The Taming of the Shrew\", in 1915 and 1923. The first version is of historical interest for its use of a primitive sound process called Voxograph, which required offstage actors to dub the voices at the same time that the performers were filmed. The second version in 1923 is the earliest surviving British film, visualising the play in about 22 minutes, and retaining many of Shakespeare's lines as intertitles.\n\nThe company was wound up in 1924.\n\n"}
{"id": "13887298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13887298", "title": "Commune (model of government)", "text": "Commune (model of government)\n\nThe commune is a model of government that is generally advocated by communists, revolutionary socialists, and anarchists. The model is often characterized as being a local and transparent organization composed of delegates bound by mandates. These delegates would be recallable at any time from their positions. Proponents view the right of recall as a particularly important safeguard against corruption and unresponsiveness among the representatives.\n\nAlmost universally, socialists, communists, and anarchists have seen the Commune as a model for the liberated society that will come after the masses are liberated from capitalism, a society based on participatory democracy from the grass roots up.\n\nMarx and Engels, Bakunin, and later Lenin and Trotsky gained major theoretical lessons (in particular as regards the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" and the \"withering away of the state\") from the limited experience of the Paris Commune.\n\nNonetheless, these very advocates provided critiques of the commune. Marx found it aggravating that the Communards pooled all their resources into first organizing democratic elections rather than gathering their forces and attacking Versailles in a timely fashion. Many Marxists, based on their interpretation of the historical evidence and on Marx's writings on the subject, believe that the Communards were too \"soft\" on the non-proletarian elements in their midst.\n\nBut the idea of the commune as a libertarian social organization has persisted within revolutionary theory. Kropotkin criticized modern representative democracy as merely being an instrument for the ruling class, and argued that a new society would have to be organized on entirely different principles which involved every individual more directly. He treats the nation state as a capitalist territorial organization which imposes itself over many communities through the spectacle of participation which elections deceptively provide. Communes on the other hand are expected to endow communities with autonomy from external powers and offer each person within them a part in decision-making processes, through communal assemblies and easily revocable delegates.\n\nKarl Marx, in his pamphlet \"The Civil War in France\" (1871), written during the Commune, advocated the Commune's achievements, and described it as the prototype for a revolutionary government of the future, 'the form at last discovered' for the emancipation of the proletariat.\n\nThus in Marxist theory, the commune is a form of political organization adopted during the first (or lower) phase of communism, socialism. Communes are proposed as the proletarian counterpart to bourgeois political forms such as parliaments. In his pamphlet, Marx explains the purpose and function of the commune during the period that he termed the dictatorship of the proletariat:\n\nMarx based these ideas on the example of the Paris Commune, which he described in \"The Civil War in France\":\n\nIn addition to local governance, the communes were to play a central role in the national government:\n\nBakunin eventually diverged sharply both personally and ideologically from Marx and such a divergence is evident in his thought. Bakunin never advocated a dictatorship of the proletariat, but instead a collectivism based on communes and cooperative worker's associations allied together into a decentralized and stateless federation. In his \"Revolutionary Catechism\" he laid down the principles on which he believed a free, anarchist society should be founded upon. This included the political organization of society into communes:\n\nThe autonomous commune is furthermore based upon the complete liberty of the individual and dedicated to its realization. Bakunin's anarchist commune is not organized into a dictatorship of the proletariat but a loose, yet cohesive federation that attempts to achieve the aims of the actively revolutionary class as a whole.\n\nJeff Shantz points out in his book Constructive Anarchy: Building Infrastructures of Resistance, in hopes of mass communes one day being a reality, that \"Mini-communes and squats exist all over the world, but comprise only a marginal pattern of social organization in relation to society at large. However, many of them provide a self-conscious example of how a socialist society would function, even if only on a microsociological level. As they are, socialist mini-communes are, along with workers' associations, the germs for the development of mass, socially complex communist communes.\". This hypothetical is an example of what organizations like workers-organizations could lead to if brought to sufficient scale. In the case that this gradual progression is true, it would have implications both on the way that workers-organizations and their like are perceived both by those who hope for mass communes to be a reality and those who do not. For those who support communes, it would motivate them at a policy-level to encourage workers-organizations, for those who oppose communes, it would encourage them to abolish workers-organizations at every opportunity. The idea that workers-organizations gradually progress into communes, thus brings into question whether or not workers-organizations are fundamentally healthy or destructive in their long-term function. It is important to note at this point, that some do believe that workers-organizations are part of an inevitable progress towards mass-communes.\n\n\n\n"}

During the late '60 and early '70s, Travis served on President Richard Nixon’s Housing Task Force and President Gerald Ford’s Task Force on Urban Renewal.\n\nTravis was also involved with the Civil Rights movement, and while serving as president of the NAACP Chicago chapter in 1959 he coordinated Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s first civil rights march in Chicago on July 24, 1960.\n\nTravis’ career as an author began when he founded Urban Research Institute, later renamed Urban Research Press, in 1969. The Press was initially established to publish two studies on socioeconomic issues affecting urban African Americans, but later evolved into a literary press, publishing 21 of Travis’ books. Travis’s first book was the children’s book, \"Don’t Stop Me Now\" (1970). In 1981, he wrote \"An Autobiography of Black Chicago\" and became the first African-American author to have a book listed on the \"Chicago Tribune\" non-fiction bestsellers list. Travis would later publish \"An Autobiography of Black Jazz\" (1983) These three books exemplify Travis’ writing style, which weaves historical research and information gathered from in-depth interviews with biographical anecdotes. Travis also published \"An Autobiography of Black Politics\" (1987), \"The Victory Monument\", \"I Refuse to Learn to Fail\", and \"Views from the Back of the Bus\".\n\nTravis is listed in \"Who’s Who in America\", \"Who’s Who in Finance and Industry\", and \"Who’s Who in the World\". He was also listed among the \"People Who Have Made a Difference\" by the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" and was one of \"Ebony\"’s \"100 Most Influential Black Americans\". He was also the subject of numerous television programs: five of these shows have received Emmy nominations. He also received \"Black Enterprise\" magazine’s \"First Annual Finance Achievement Award\" on February 21, 1975.\n\nThe Dempsey Travis Papers exist in three locations: Roosevelt University Library, Chicago Public Library Vivian G. Harsh Research Collection, and Chicago History Museum. \nThe papers showcase Travis’ career as an author, as opposed to his career as a real estate entrepreneur, and contain an extensive collection of interviews with prominent African-American figures in various fields including politics, business, and entertainment. The papers are arranged in series based on individual books, or subject of books, with the majority of series containing edited drafts, transcribed interviews, and general research.\n\n"}

Today, Guaman Poma is noted for his illustrated chronicle, \"Nueva corónica y buen gobierno\".\n\nThe son of a noble family from the central southern Peruvian province of Lucanas located in the modern day department of Ayacucho, he was a direct descendent of the eminent indigenous conqueror and ruler Huaman-Chava-Ayauca Yarovilca-Huanuco, Felipe Guamán Poma de Ayala was a fluent speaker of several Quechua and Aru dialects, who probably learned the Spanish language as a child or adolescent. He went on to become literate in the language, although he did not achieve a perfect grasp of Spanish grammar. He described himself as \"eighty years of age\" in his 1615 manuscript, leading many to deduce that he was born in the year 1535, after the 1533 Spanish conquest of Peru. It seems that he used the figure \"80\" as a metaphor for old age, however, and many other references in his text indicate a possible birthdate of 1550 or shortly thereafter.\n\nThe information known about Guamán Poma's life comes from a variety of written sources. Most likely he was born in the Lucanas province and spent most of his life in or near Huamanga, a central Peruvian district. It is believed that the first time he left his hometown was when he served as an interpreter on the church inspection tour of a Spanish priest named Cristóbal de Albornoz, who was attempting to eliminate idolatries in the small Quechua towns. In the late 1580s to early 1590s, he was an assistant to Fray Martin de Murúa, another Spanish cleric. In 1594 he was employed by the Spanish judge of Huamanga who was in charge of land titles. In late 1600, however, all of his property was confiscated and he was banished from Huamanga, an event that led to his travels throughout the country and most likely to the composition of his masterpiece.\n\nBased on a published work, in 1967, by archaeologist Edward P. Lanning, \"Peru before the Incas\", one of the first references to an organized culture around the Huaman Culture, was between 1000 CE - 1476 CE, known as the \"Late Intermediate\", before the Inca Empire expanded, forming alliances with the most powerful empires.\n\nThe Huaman Family, per stirpes, belonged to the wealthy among the Inca Empire, before and after. As it used to be common, the marriages among the ruling families took place, to remain in control and current. At the time, the Huaman (or Waman, in Quechua; or Guaman after the Spaniard conquest) were a selected family of warriors, and land owners in several regions of the pre-Inca empire. They venerated the wild bird (similar to a Falcon), that only grows in the Andean Region of Peru, above 4,000 meters above sea level.\n\nThere can be found, among the Inca's family tree lines: a)Tarco Huaman Inca, son of Inca Mayta Capac, cousin of Capac Yupanqui, and grandson of Lloque Yupanqui. b) Huaman Achachi, brother of Tupac Inca Yupanqui. c)Inca Huaman Taysi, son of Inca Rocca. d)Landowner Don Antonio Huaman Cucho, in Huamanga City, in 1570 declares ownership of several cities for the descendent of the Huaman Family as an Inca descendent.\n\nDuring the occupation of the conquerors, the Huaman Family, being a very extensive family, were fiercely prosecuted, fearing the overtake of the Andean government, the impeachment of the Hispanic occupation and land ownership claims. Reasons for which most of wealth in pure gold, and ornaments were hidden and re-distributed among the descendants. Most family members moved to different areas from Peru and Ecuador. The most prominent landowners were located in Pariamarca, Santiago de Huaman, Quito and Huamanga.\n\nThere is a tale that says that direct descendants from the ruling Inca Huaman, are protected and secretly maintained as of \"ready\" to overtake the Peruvian empire and re-impose the supremacy of order over chaos. There are tales among the Andeans that one day the \"...Hawk will fly high, where the Sun surrenders...\"\nA handful of sixteenth-century documents attest that Huaman Poma served in the 1560s-70s as a Quechua translator for Fray Cristóbal de Albornoz in his campaign to eradicate the messianic apostasy, known as \"Taki Unquy\", from the Christian doctrine of local believers.\n\nHuaman Poma appeared as a plaintiff in a series of lawsuits from the late 1590s, in which he attempted to recover land and political title in the Chupas valley that he believed to be his by family right. These suits ultimately proved disastrous for him; not only did he lose the suits, but in 1600 he was stripped of all his property and forced into exile from the towns which he had once ruled as a noble.\n\nHuaman Poma's great work was the \"El primer nueva corónica [sic] y buen gobierno\" (\"The First New Chronicle and Good Government\"), a 1,189-page document written largely in Spanish, with sections in Quechua. He wrote \"Corónica\" instead of \"Crónica\", a form of the word common in the Middle Ages. His book remains the longest sustained critique of Spanish colonial rule produced by an indigenous subject in the entire colonial period. Written between 1600 and 1615 and addressed to King Philip III of Spain, the \"Corónica\" outlines the injustices of colonial rule and argues that the Spanish were foreign settlers in Peru. \"It is our country,\" he said, \"because God has given it to us.\" The king never received the document.\n\nThe \"Crónica\" is remarkable in many ways. First, it has brilliant melding of writing and fine line drawings (398 pages of the book consist of Huaman Poma's famous full-page drawings). The work also includes Huaman Poma's 'Mapa Mundi de Reino de las Indias', a cartographic representation of the Inca Empire drawn in the Mappa mundi style favored by medieval European mapmakers, which placed Cusco, the Peruvian capital, at the center of the world. Second, the manuscript expresses the view of a provincial noble on the conquest, whereas most other existing expressions of indigenous views from the colonial era come from the nobility of Cusco, the ancient capital of the Incas). Third, the author frequently uses Quechua words and phrases in this primarily Spanish work, which provided material for scholars to learn more about Quechua.\n\nHuaman Poma proposed a new direction for the governance of Peru: a \"good government\" that would draw from Inca social and economic structures, European technology, and Christian theology, adapted to the practical needs of Andean peoples. He writes that indigenous governments treated their subjects far better than the Spaniards and pleads with King Phillip to instate Indians to positions of authority. It is important to note that, although he rejects Spanish rule, he does not reject the Spanish king. During that time, monarchs were typically seen as descendants of God and being strongly Catholic, Guaman Poma holds the Spanish monarch in the highest regard. In his writing, he not only wants to propose changes in society, but also to bring perceived injustices to the attention of the king, who, as representative of God, surely would not have allowed them to occur had he known.\n\nThe original manuscript of the \"Corónica\" has been kept in the Danish Royal Library since at least the early 1660s, though it only came into public view in 1908, when it was discovered by the German scholar Richard Pietschmann. After many aborted facsimile-projects, a heavily retouched facsimile edition was produced in Paris in 1936, by Paul Rivet. In 1980, a critical transcription of the book, based on autopsy of the manuscript rather than on the 1936 facsimile, was published by John Murra and Rolena Adorno (with contributions by Jorge Urioste) as Felipe Huaman Poma de Ayala, \"Nueva crónica y buen gobierno\" (Mexico City: Siglo XXI). A high-quality digital facsimile of the original manuscript was published online in 2001 by the Danish Royal Library, with Rolena Adorno as scholarly editor.\n\nTwentieth-century scholars had often speculated that there was some relationship between Guaman Poma's \"Corónica\" and Fray Martín de Murúa's \"Historia general del Piru\" (1616), assuming that Guaman Poma served as an informant or coauthor to Murúa. In 1967, Condarco Morales compared the texts and concluded that Guaman Poma followed Murúa's work. A direct relationship between Guaman Poma and Murúa was confirmed in 2007-2008 by a project at the Getty Research Institute. The project's principal scholars included Juan de Ossio, Thomas Cummins, and Barbara Anderson, with collaboration by Rolena Adorno and Ivan Boserup. After comparing the two existing manuscripts of \"Historia general del Piru\" (one owned by the Getty and the other by a private collector in Ireland), these scholars proved that Murúa's chronicle includes illustrations by Guaman Poma. They concluded that Guaman Poma was one of a team of scribes and artists who worked for Murúa. While Murúa's project began sometime in the 1580s, Guaman Poma became involved only as an illustrator and only shortly before 1600. Still, his contribution to \"Historia general del Piru\" is very significant. These findings were the basis of an exhibition and symposium at the Getty Center in October 2008.\nGuaman Poma notably attacks Murúa in his \"Corónica\", including depicting the friar's striking and kicking an indigenous woman seated at a loom. This image is entitled \"The Mercedarian friar Martín de Murúa abuses his parishioners and takes justice into his own hands.\" According to Rolena Adorno, \"...when he became an author, after 1600, [Guaman Poma] was highly critical of a work by Murúa that he had recently illustrated. Guaman Poma was prompted to write his own account against what he understood to be Murúa's limited perspective, which he had encountered in [the original manuscript of \"Historia general del Piru\"].\n\nGuaman Poma wrote about Andean history back to the era predating the Inca. He also elaborated a long and highly critical survey of colonial society, unique among other manuscripts of the era. Guaman Poma's artistic range, displayed in his nearly 400 drawings, was based on his experience gained while working with Murúa, but it also developed in new directions. He revealed a strong polemical and satirical bent that he directed against colonial abuses. \"Although the evidence suggests that they worked independently after 1600, the efforts of Murúa and Guaman Poma can never be separated, and their talents, individually and together, produced three distinctive testimonies to the interaction between missionary author and indigenous artist-cum-author in early colonial Peru.\"\n\nGuaman's name means \"Falcon\" or \"Aguila\" when translated into English and Spanish respectively. At the time, a Falcon, had the meaning of a representation of a \"Supreme Existence\". Someone, with the \"designation\" of a \"Falcon\" had the highest regards within the Inca and predesecing cultures. Poma's name meant \"Puma\" in Quechua dialect. In modern Quechua orthography, it would be spelled Waman Puma, and it is sometimes listed as such. Other variants include Waman Poma, Huamán Poma, and Guamán Poma (the latter two with a Spanish accent; the Quechua stress is on the first syllable). In his own writing, he signed with his Quechua name put between his Spanish baptismal name, Felipe (or Phelipe, as he spelled it) and the family name of a Spanish conquistador connected to his family history, Luis Ávalos de Ayala. Guaman Poma writes about the symbolism of all his names in his book. He seemed to consider the form of his name as a statement that his Quechua identity remained his core, although it was surrounded by Spanish names.\n\n\n"}

He also served as a Senator of the Republic and as Governor of the State of Tabasco.\n\nFrancisco Javier Santamaría was born in 1886 in the \"ranchería\" of Cacaos, to a \"criollo\" family of modest means. He began his schooling in Macuspana and completed his studies in Villahermosa (then called San Juan Bautista) at the Instituto Juárez, where he graduated with a teaching degree. He subsequently moved to Mexico City to study law, obtaining his license in 1912.\n\nBeginning at a young age Santamaría demonstrated a talent for composition and an appreciation for the belles-lettres which would eventually evolve into a prolific career as a writer, lexicographer and linguist; his two most often cited works are the \"Diccionario General de Americanismos\" and the \"Diccionario de Mejicanismos\", the second of which is a continuation and completion of Joaquín García Icazbalceta's original project.\n\nAt the start of his political career Santamaría was an outspoken critic of Plutarco Elías Calles and the Partido Labortista over which he presided. He was also a close friend and political associate of General Francisco R. Serrano (an inveterate enemy of Calles's), and supported the latter's presidential campaign for the 1925-1928 term, an enterprise which would ultimately end in the murderous defeat of Serrano and his closest associates. Santamaría would be the only one on Elías Calles's hit list to not fall the night of October 2, 1927, an event known as the \"Huitzilac Massacre,\" which resulted in the summary executions of Serrano and twenty six other generals, and which President Álvaro Obregón ordered out of fear of military rebellion. His escape and survival would, however, result in years of exile and poverty in the U.S., an account of which he gives in \"Crónicas del destierro: Desde la ciudad de hierro\" (Chronicles of Exile: From the Iron City).\n\nAfter returning to Mexico Santamaría re-entered politics by joining the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI); eventually going on to serve as a Senator of the Republic for Tabasco from 1940 to 1946. Immediately after the conclusion of his term he was selected by the party as its candidate for the governorship of Tabasco, competed against three opponents and won handily, reportedly receiving 95% of the votes. As governor he worked to improve his state's educational system and general level of cultural and technological development, while continuing to write books and essays on a variety of subjects.\n\nFrancisco Javier Santamaría was a numerary member of the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua and held seat 23.\n\n\n\n"}

He thought that Shakespeare scholars should not dismiss the claims of those who believe that someone other than Shakespeare wrote the canon, and that treating the subject with silence worked instead to encourage rather than discourage such theories. Thirty-five years later he reviewed the field in an article published in the \"Shakespeare Newsletter\", \"The Poacher Re-Visited,\" in which he wrote:\n\nIt is important that we recognize the iconoclasts, particularly those of us who are teachers. But as Shakespeareans … we should not do it by visiting upon them the disdain of the past but by letting them speak freely for themselves … Our role should be not to suppress debate but to instruct students how to consider the Oxfordians’ (and others’) arguments carefully and thoughtfully. That exercise will make students not just more responsible as far as Shakespeare is concerned, but also wiser, more critical, more judicial, in dealing with the complex challenges they will face in the difficult decades which lie ahead of them.\nWe demystify authorship controversies, assassination conspiracies, theories of extra-terrestrial shindigs, even painful social demands, by letting their proponents speak out, not by censoring them.

The painters of Renaissance Italy, although often attached to particular courts and with loyalties to particular towns, nonetheless wandered the length and breadth of Italy, often occupying a diplomatic status and disseminating artistic and philosophical ideas.\n\nThe city of Florence in Tuscany is renowned as the birthplace of the Renaissance, and in particular of Renaissance painting, although later in the era Rome and Venice assumed increasing importance in painting. A detailed background is given in the companion articles Renaissance and Renaissance architecture.\n\nItalian Renaissance painting is most often be divided into four periods: the Proto-Renaissance (1300–1425), the Early Renaissance (1425–1495), the High Renaissance (1495–1520), and Mannerism (1520–1600). The dates for these periods represent the overall trend in Italian painting and do not cover all painters as the lives of individual artists and their personal styles overlapped these periods. \n\nThe Proto-Renaissance begins with the professional life of the painter Giotto and includes Taddeo Gaddi, Orcagna and Altichiero.\nThe Early Renaissance style was started by Masaccio and then further developed by Fra Angelico, Paolo Uccello, Piero della Francesca, Sandro Botticelli, Verrocchio, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Giovanni Bellini. The High Renaissance period was that of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Andrea del Sarto, Coreggio, Giorgione, the latter works of Giovanni Bellini, and Titian. The Mannerist period, dealt with in a separate article, included the latter works of Michelangelo, as well as Pontormo, Parmigianino, Bronzino and Tintoretto.\n\nThe influences upon the development of Renaissance painting in Italy are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government and other aspects of society. The following is a summary of points dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.\n\nA number of Classical texts, that had been lost to Western European scholars for centuries, became available. These included Philosophy, Poetry, Drama, Science, a thesis on the Arts and Early Christian Theology. The resulting interest in Humanist philosophy meant that man's relationship with humanity, the universe and with God was no longer the exclusive province of the Church. A revived interest in the Classics brought about the first archaeological study of Roman remains by the architect Brunelleschi and sculptor Donatello. The revival of a style of architecture based on classical precedents inspired a corresponding classicism in painting, which manifested itself as early as the 1420s in the paintings of Masaccio and Paolo Uccello.\n\nSimultaneous with gaining access to the Classical texts, Europe gained access to advanced mathematics which had its provenance in the works of Byzantine and Islamic scholars.\nThe advent of movable type printing in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broad public. The development of oil paint and its introduction to Italy had lasting effects on the art of painting.\n\nThe establishment of the Medici Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, Florence. Cosimo de' Medici set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy. The serendipitous presence within the region of Florence of certain individuals of artistic genius, most notably Giotto, Masaccio, Brunelleschi, Piero della Francesca, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, formed an ethos that supported and encouraged many lesser artists to achieve work of extraordinary quality. A similar heritage of artistic achievement occurred in Venice through the talented Bellini family, their influential inlaw Mantegna, Giorgione, Titian and Tintoretto.\n\nMuch painting of the Renaissance period was commissioned by or for the Catholic Church. These works were often of large scale and were frequently cycles painted in fresco of \"the Life of Christ\", the \"Life of the Virgin\" or the life of a saint, particularly St. Francis of Assisi. There were also many allegorical paintings on the theme of Salvation and the role of the Church in attaining it. Churches also commissioned altarpieces, which were painted in tempera on panel and later in oil on canvas. Apart from large altarpieces, small devotional pictures were produced in very large numbers, both for churches and for private individuals, the most common theme being the \"Madonna and Child\".\n\nThroughout the period, civic commissions were also important. Local government buildings were decorated with frescoes and other works both secular, such as Ambrogio Lorenzetti's \"The Allegory of Good and Bad Government\", and religious, such as Simone Martini's fresco of the \"Maestà\", in the Palazzo Pubblico, Siena.\n\nPortraiture was uncommon in the 14th and early 15th centuries, mostly limited to civic commemorative pictures such as the equestrian portraits of Guidoriccio da Fogliano by Simone Martini, 1327, in Siena and, of the early 15th century, John Hawkwood by Uccello in Florence Cathedral and its companion portraying Niccolò da Tolentino by Andrea del Castagno.\n\nDuring the 15th century portraiture became common, initially often formalised profile portraits but increasingly three-quarter face, bust-length portraits. Patrons of art works such as altarpieces and fresco cycles often were included in the scenes, a notable example being the inclusion of the Sassetti and Medici families in Domenico Ghirlandaio's cycle in the Sassetti Chapel. Portraiture was to become a major subject for High Renaissance painters such as Raphael and Titian and continue into the Mannerist period in works of artists such as Bronzino.\n\nWith the growth of Humanism, artists turned to Classical themes, particularly to fulfill commissions for the decoration of the homes of wealthy patrons, the best known being Botticelli's \"Birth of Venus \"for the Medici. Increasingly, Classical themes were also seen as providing suitable allegorical material for civic commissions. Humanism also influenced the manner in which religious themes were depicted, notably on Michelangelo's \"Ceiling of the Sistine Chapel\".\n\nOther motifs were drawn from contemporary life, sometimes with allegorical meaning, some sometimes purely decorative. Incidents important to a particular family might be recorded like those in the \"Camera degli Sposi\" that Mantegna painted for the Gonzaga family at Mantua. Increasingly, still lifes and decorative scenes from life were painted, such as \"the Concert\" by Lorenzo Costa of about 1490.\n\nImportant events were often recorded or commemorated in paintings such as Uccello's \"Battle of San Romano\", as were important local religious festivals. History and historic characters were often depicted in a way that reflected on current events or on the lives of current people. Portraits were often painted of contemporaries in the guise of characters from history or literature. The writings of Dante, Voragine's \"Golden Legend\" and Boccaccio's Decameron were important sources of themes.\n\nIn all these subjects, increasingly, and in the works of almost all painters, certain underlying painterly practices were being developed: the observation of nature, the study of anatomy, of light, and perspective.\n\nThe art of the region of Tuscany in the late 13th century was dominated by two masters of the Byzantine style, Cimabue of Florence and Duccio of Siena. Their commissions were mostly religious paintings, several of them being very large altarpieces showing the Madonna and Child. These two painters, with their contemporaries, Guido of Siena, Coppo di Marcovaldo and the mysterious painter upon whose style the school may have been based, the so-called Master of St Bernardino, all worked in a manner that was highly formalised and dependent upon the ancient tradition of icon painting. In these tempera paintings many of the details were rigidly fixed by the subject matter, the precise position of the hands of the Madonna and Christ Child, for example, being dictated by the nature of the blessing that the painting invoked upon the viewer. The angle of the Virgin's head and shoulders, the folds in her veil, and the lines with which her features were defined had all been repeated in countless such paintings. Cimabue and Duccio took steps in the direction of greater naturalism, as did their contemporary, Pietro Cavallini of Rome.\n\nGiotto, (1266–1337), by tradition a shepherd boy from the hills north of Florence, became Cimabue's apprentice and emerged as the most outstanding painter of his time. Giotto, possibly influenced by Pietro Cavallini and other Roman painters, did not base the figures he painted upon any painterly tradition, but upon the observation of life. Unlike those of his Byzantine contemporaries, Giotto's figures are solidly three-dimensional; they stand squarely on the ground, have discernible anatomy and are clothed in garments with weight and structure. But more than anything, what set Giotto's figures apart from those of his contemporaries are their emotions. In the faces of Giotto's figures are joy, rage, despair, shame, spite and love. The cycle of frescoes of \"the Life of Christ\" and \"the Life of the Virgin\" that he painted in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua set a new standard for narrative pictures. His \"Ognissanti Madonna\" hangs in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, in the same room as Cimabue's \"Santa Trinita Madonna\" and Duccio's \"Ruccellai Madonna\" where the stylistic comparisons between the three can easily be made. One of the features apparent in Giotto's work is his observation of naturalistic perspective. He is regarded as the herald of the Renaissance.\nGiotto had a number of contemporaries who were either trained and influenced by him, or whose observation of nature had led them in a similar direction. Although several of Giotto's pupils assimilated the direction that his work had taken, none was to become as successful as he. Taddeo Gaddi achieved the first large painting of a night scene in an \"Annunciation to the Shepherds\" in the Baroncelli Chapel of the Church of Santa Croce, Florence.\n\nThe paintings in the \"Upper Church\" of the Basilica of St. Francis, Assisi, are examples of naturalistic painting of the period, often ascribed to Giotto himself, but more probably the work of artists surrounding Pietro Cavallini. A late painting by Cimabue in the \"Lower Church\" at Assisi, of the \"Madonna and St. Francis\", also clearly shows greater naturalism than his panel paintings and the remains of his earlier frescoes in the upper church.\n\nA common theme in the decoration of Medieval churches was the \"Last Judgement\", which in northern European churches frequently occupies a sculptural space above the west door, but in Italian churches such as Giotto's Scrovegni Chapel, is painted on the inner west wall. The Black Death of 1348 caused its survivors to focus on the need to approach death in a state of penitence and absolution. The inevitability of death, the rewards for the penitent and the penalties of sin were emphasised in a number of frescoes, remarkable for their grim depictions of suffering and their surreal images of the torments of Hell.\n\nThese include the \"Triumph of Death\" by Giotto's pupil Orcagna, now in a fragmentary state at the Museum of Santa Croce, and the \"Triumph of Death\" in the Camposanto Monumentale at Pisa by an unknown painter, perhaps Francesco Traini or Buonamico Buffalmacco who worked on the other three of a series of frescoes on the subject of Salvation. It is unknown exactly when these frescoes were begun but it is generally presumed they post-date 1348.\n\nTwo important fresco painters were active in Padua in the late 14th century, Altichiero and Giusto de' Menabuoi. Giusto's masterpiece, the decoration of the Cathedral's Baptistery, follows the theme of humanity's Creation, Downfall and Salvation, also having a rare Apocalypse cycle in the small chancel. While the whole work is exceptional for its breadth, quality and intact state, the treatment of human emotion is conservative by comparison with that of Altichiero's \"Crucifixion\" at the Basilica of Sant'Antonio, also in Padua. Giusto's work relies on formalised gestures, where Altichiero relates the incidents surrounding Christ's death with great human drama and intensity.\nIn Florence, at the \"Spanish Chapel\" of Santa Maria Novella, Andrea Bonaiuti was commissioned to emphasise the role of the Church in the redemptive process, and that of the Dominican Order in particular. His fresco \"Allegory of the Active and Triumphant Church\" is remarkable for its depiction of Florence Cathedral, complete with the dome which was not built until the following century.\n\nDuring the later 14th century, International Gothic was the style that dominated Tuscan painting. It can be seen to an extent in the work of Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, which is marked by a formalized sweetness and grace in the figures, and Late Gothic gracefulness in the draperies. The style is fully developed in the works of Simone Martini and Gentile da Fabriano, which have an elegance and a richness of detail, and an idealised quality not compatible with the starker realities of Giotto's paintings.\n\nIn the early 15th century, bridging the gap between International Gothic and the Renaissance are the paintings of Fra Angelico, many of which, being altarpieces in tempera, show the Gothic love of elaboration, gold leaf and brilliant colour. It is in his frescoes at his convent of Sant' Marco that Fra Angelico shows himself the artistic disciple of Giotto. These devotional paintings, which adorn the cells and corridors inhabited by the friars, represent episodes from the life of Jesus, many of them being scenes of \"the Crucifixion\". They are starkly simple, restrained in colour and intense in mood as the artist sought to make spiritual revelations a visual reality.\nThe earliest truly Renaissance images in Florence date from 1401, although they are not paintings. That year a competition was held amongst seven young artists to select the artist to create a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistry of St. John, the oldest remaining church in the city. The competitors were each to design a bronze panel of similar shape and size, representing \"the Sacrifice of Isaac\".\n\nTwo of the panels from the competition have survived, those by Lorenzo Ghiberti and Brunelleschi. Each panel shows some strongly classicising motifs indicating the direction that art and philosophy were moving, at that time. Ghiberti used the naked figure of Isaac to create a small sculpture in the Classical style. The figure kneels on a tomb decorated with acanthus scrolls that are also a reference to the art of Ancient Rome. In Brunelleschi's panel, one of the additional figures included in the scene is reminiscent of a well-known Roman bronze figure of a boy pulling a thorn from his foot. Brunelleschi's creation is challenging in its dynamic intensity. Less elegant than Ghiberti's, it is more about human drama and impending tragedy.\n\nGhiberti won the competition. His first set of Baptistry doors took 27 years to complete, after which he was commissioned to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground for many of the artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of linear perspective, the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art. \n\nThe first Early Rennaissance frescos or paintings were in started in 1425 when two artists commenced painting a fresco cycle of \"the Life of St. Peter\" in the chapel of the Brancacci family, at the Carmelite Church in Florence. They both were called by the name of Tommaso and were nicknamed Masaccio and Masolino, Slovenly Tom and Little Tom.\n\nMore than any other artist, Masaccio recognized the implications in the work of Giotto. He carried forward the practice of painting from nature. His frescos demonstrate an understanding of anatomy, of foreshortening, of linear perspective, of light, and the study of drapery. In the Brancacci Chapel, his \"Tribute Money\" fresco has a single vanishing point and uses a strong contrast between light and dark to convey a three-dimensional quality to the work. As well, the figures of \"Adam and Eve being expelled from Eden\", painted on the side of the arch into the chapel, are renowned for their realistic depiction of the human form and of human emotion. They contrast with the gentle and pretty figures painted by Masolino on the opposite side of \"Adam and Eve receiving the forbidden fruit\". The painting of the Brancacci Chapel was left incomplete when Masaccio died at 26 in 1428. The \"Tribute Money\" was completed by Masolino while the remainder of the work in the Chapel was finished by Filippino Lippi in the 1480s. Masaccio's work became a source of inspiration to many later painters, including Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.\n\nDuring the first half of the 15th century, the achieving of the effect of realistic space in a painting by the employment of linear perspective was a major preoccupation of many painters, as well as the architects Brunelleschi and Alberti who both theorised about the subject. Brunelleschi is known to have done a number of careful studies of the piazza and octagonal baptistery outside Florence Cathedral and it is thought he aided Masaccio in the creation of his famous trompe l'oeil niche around the \"Holy Trinity\" he painted at Santa Maria Novella.\n\nAccording to Vasari, Paolo Uccello was so obsessed with perspective that he thought of little else and experimented with it in many paintings, the best known being the three Battle of San Romano paintings (completed by 1450s) which use broken weapons on the ground, and fields on the distant hills to give an impression of perspective.\n\nIn the 1450s Piero della Francesca, in paintings such as \"The Flagellation of Christ\", demonstrated his mastery over linear perspective and also over the science of light. Another painting exists, a cityscape, by an unknown artist, perhaps Piero della Francesca, that demonstrates the sort of experiment that Brunelleschi had been making. From this time linear perspective was understood and regularly employed, such as by Perugino in his \"Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter\" (1481-82) in the Sistine Chapel.\nGiotto used tonality to create form. Taddeo Gaddi in his nocturnal scene in the Baroncelli Chapel demonstrated how light could be used to create drama. Paolo Uccello, a hundred years later, experimented with the dramatic effect of light in some of his almost monochrome frescoes. He did a number of these in \"terra verde\" or \"green earth\", enlivening his compositions with touches of vermilion. The best known is his equestrian portrait of John Hawkwood on the wall of Florence Cathedral. Both here and on the four heads of prophets that he painted around the inner clockface in the cathedral, he used strongly contrasting tones, suggesting that each figure was being lit by a natural light source, as if the source was an actual window in the cathedral.\n\nPiero della Francesca carried his study of light further. In the \"Flagellation\" he demonstrates a knowledge of how light is proportionally disseminated from its point of origin. There are two sources of light in this painting, one internal to a building and the other external. Of the internal source, though the light itself is invisible, its position can be calculated with mathematical certainty. Leonardo da Vinci was to carry forward Piero's work on light.\n\nThe Blessed Virgin Mary, revered by the Catholic Church worldwide, was particularly evoked in Florence, where there was a miraculous image of her on a column in the corn market and where both the Cathedral of \"Our Lady of the Flowers\" and the large Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella were named in her honour.\n\nThe miraculous image in the corn market was destroyed by fire, but replaced with a new image in the 1330s by Bernardo Daddi, set in an elaborately designed and lavishly wrought canopy by Orcagna. The open lower storey of the building was enclosed and dedicated as Orsanmichele.\n\nDepictions of the Madonna and Child were a very popular art form in Florence. They took every shape from small mass-produced terracotta plaques to magnificent altarpieces such as those by Cimabue, Giotto and Masaccio.\n\nIn the 15th and first half of the 16th centuries, one workshop more than any other dominated the production of Madonnas. They were the della Robbia family, and they were not painters but modellers in clay. Luca della Robbia, famous for his \"cantoria gallery\" at the cathedral, was the first sculptor to use glazed terracotta for large sculptures. Many of the durable works of this family have survived. The skill of the della Robbias, particularly Andrea della Robbia, was to give great naturalism to the babies that they modelled as Jesus, and expressions of great piety and sweetness to the Madonna. They were to set a standard to be emulated by other artists of Florence.\n\nAmong those who painted devotional Madonnas during the Early Renaissance are Fra Angelico, Fra Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and Davide Ghirlandaio. The custom was continued by Botticelli who produced a series of Madonnas over a period of twenty years for the Medici; Perugino, whose Madonnas and saints are known for their sweetness and Leonardo da Vinci, for whom a number of small attributed Madonnas such as the \"Benois Madonna\" have survived. Even Michelangelo who was primarily a sculptor, was persuaded to paint the \"Doni Tondo\", while for Raphael, they are among his most popular and numerous works.\n\nOne of the most influential painters of northern Italy was Andrea Mantegna of Padua, who had the good fortune to be in his teen years at the time in which the great Florentine sculptor Donatello was working there. Donatello created the enormous equestrian bronze, the first since the Roman Empire, of the condotiero Gattemelata, still visible on its plinth in the square outside the Basilica of Sant'Antonio. He also worked on the high altar and created a series of bronze panels in which he achieved a remarkable illusion of depth, with perspective in the architectural settings and apparent roundness of the human form all in very shallow relief.\n\nAt only 17 years old, Mantegna accepted his first commission, fresco cycles of the \"Lives of Saints James and Christopher\" for the Ovetari Chapel in the transept of thechurch of the Eremitani, near the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua. Unfortunately the building was mostly destroyed during World War II, and they are only known from photographs which reveal an already highly developed sense of perspective and a knowledge of antiquity, for which the ancient University of Padua had become well known, early in the 15th century.\nMantegna's last work in Padua was a monumental San Zeno altarpiece, created for the abbot of the Basilica of San Zeno, Verona from 1457 to 1459. This polyptych of which the predella panels are particularly notable for the handling of landscape elements, was to influence the further development of Renaissance art in Northern Italy.\n\nMantegna's most famous work is the interior decoration of the Camera degli Sposi for the Gonzaga family in Mantua, dated about 1470. The walls are frescoed with scenes of the life of the Gonzaga family, talking, greeting a younger son and his tutor on their return from Rome, preparing for a hunt and other such scenes that make no obvious reference to matters historic, literary, philosophic or religious. They are remarkable for simply being about family life. The one concession is the scattering of jolly winged cherubs who hold up plaques and garlands and clamber on the illusionistic pierced balustrade that surrounds a trompe l'oeil view of the sky that decks the ceiling of the chamber. Mantegna's main legacy in considered the introduction of spatial illusionism, carried out by a mastery of perspective, both in frescoes and in \"sacra conversazione\" paintings: his tradition of ceiling decoration was followed for almost three centuries.\n\nIn 1442 Alfonso V of Aragon became ruler of Naples, bringing with him a collection of Flemish paintings and setting up a Humanist Academy. Antonello da Messina seems to have had access to the King's collection, which may have included the works of Jan van Eyck. Recent evidence indicates that Antonello was likely in contact with Van Eyck's most accomplished follower, Petrus Christus, in Milan in early 1456 and likely learned the techniques of oil painting, including painting almost microscopic detail and minute gradations of light, directly from Christus. As well, his works' calmer expressions on peoples' faces and calmness in the works' overall composition also appears to be a Netherlandish influence. Antonello went to Venice in 1475 and remained there until the fall of 1476 so it is likely that Antonello passed on the techniques of using oil paints, painting the gradation of light, and the principles of calmness to Venetian Painters, including Giovanni Bellini, one of the most significant painters of the High Renaissance in Northern Italy, during that visit.\n\nAntonello painted mostly small meticulous portraits in glowing colours. But one of his most famous works, \"St. Jerome in His Study\", demonstrates his superior ability at handling linear perspective and light. The composition of the small painting is framed by a late Gothic arch, through which is viewed an interior, domestic on one side and ecclesiastic on the other, in the centre of which the saint sits in a wooden corral surrounded by his possessions while his lion prowls in the shadows on the floor. The way the light streams in through every door and window casting both natural and reflected light across the architecture and all the objects would have excited Piero della Francesca. \n\nIn Florence, in the later 15th century, most works of art, even those that were done as decoration for churches, were generally commissioned and paid for by private patrons. Much of the patronage came from the Medici family, or those who were closely associated with or related to them, such as the Sassetti, the Ruccellai and the Tornabuoni.\n\nIn the 1460s Cosimo de' Medici the Elder had established Marsilio Ficino as his resident Humanist philosopher, and facilitated his translation of Plato and his teaching of Platonic philosophy, which focused on humanity as the centre of the natural universe, on each person's personal relationship with God, and on fraternal or \"platonic\" love as being the closest that a person could get to emulating or understanding the love of God.\n\nIn the Medieval period, everything related to the Classical period was perceived as associated with paganism. In the Renaissance it came increasingly to be associated with enlightenment. The figures of Classical mythology began to take on a new symbolic role in Christian art and in particular, the Goddess Venus took on a new discretion. Born fully formed, by a sort of miracle, she was the new Eve, symbol of innocent love, or even, by extension, a symbol of the Virgin Mary herself. We see Venus in both these roles in the two famous tempera paintings that Botticelli did in the 1480s for Cosimo's nephew, Pierfrancesco Medici, the \"Primavera\" and the \"Birth of Venus\".\n\nMeanwhile, Domenico Ghirlandaio, a meticulous and accurate draughtsman and one of the finest portrait painters of his age, executed two cycles of frescoes for Medici associates in two of Florence's larger churches, the Sassetti Chapel at Santa Trinita and the Tornabuoni Chapel at Santa Maria Novella. In these cycles of the \"Life of St Francis\" and the \"Life of the Virgin Mary\" and \"Life of John the Baptist\" there was room for portraits of patrons and of the patrons' patrons. Thanks to Sassetti's patronage, there is a portrait of the man himself, with his employer, Lorenzo il Magnifico, and Lorenzo's three sons with their tutor, the Humanist poet and philosopher, Agnolo Poliziano. In the Tornabuoni Chapel is another portrait of Poliziano, accompanied by the other influential members of the Platonic Academy including Marsilio Ficino.\n\nFrom about 1450, with the arrival in Italy of the Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden and possibly earlier, artists were introduced to the medium of oil paint. Whereas both tempera and fresco lent themselves to the depiction of pattern, neither presented a successful way to represent natural textures realistically. The highly flexibly medium of oils, which could be made opaque or transparent, and allowed alteration and additions for days after it had been laid down, opened a new world of possibility to Italian artists.\n\nIn 1483 the huge altarpiece of \"the Adoration of the Shepherds\" painted by Hugo van der Goes arrived in Florence. Painted as early as 1475 at the behest of the Portinari family, it was shipped out from Bruges and installed in the Chapel of Sant' Egidio at the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. The altarpiece glows with intense reds and greens, contrasting with the glossy black velvet robes of the Portinari donors. In the foreground is a still life of flowers in contrasting containers, one of glazed pottery and the other of glass. The glass vase alone was enough to excite attention. But the most influential aspect of the triptych was the extremely natural and lifelike quality of the three shepherds with stubbly beards, workworn hands and expressions ranging from adoration to wonder to incomprehension. Domenico Ghirlandaio promptly painted his own version, with a beautiful Italian Madonna in place of the long-faced Flemish one, and himself, gesturing theatrically, as one of the shepherds.\n\nIn 1477 Pope Sixtus IV replaced the derelict old chapel at the Vatican in which many of the papal services were held. The interior of the new chapel, named the Sistine Chapel in his honour, appears to have been planned from the start to have a series of 16 large frescoes between its pilasters on the middle level, with a series of painted portraits of popes above them.\n\nIn 1480, a group of artists from Florence was commissioned with the work: Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli. This fresco cycle was to depict \"Stories of the Life of Moses\" on one side of the chapel, and \"Stories of the Life of Christ\" on the other with the frescoes complementing each other in theme. \"The Nativity of Jesus\" and the \"Finding of Moses\" were adjacent on the wall behind the altar, with an altarpiece of the \"Assumption of the Virgin\" between them. These paintings, all by Perugino, were later destroyed to paint Michelangelo's \"Last Judgement\".\nThe remaining 12 pictures indicate the virtuosity that these artists had attained, and the obvious cooperation between individuals who normally employed very different styles and skills. \nThe paintings gave full range to their capabilities as they included a great number of figures of men, women and children and characters ranging from guiding angels to enraged Pharaohs and the devil himself. Each painting required a landscape. Because of the scale of the figures that the artists agreed upon, in each picture, the landscape and sky take up the whole upper half of the scene. Sometimes, as in Botticelli's scene of \"The Purification of the Leper\", there are additional small narratives taking place in the landscape, in this case \"The Temptations of Christ\".\n\nPerugino's scene of \"Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter\" is remarkable for the clarity and simplicity of its composition, the beauty of the figurative painting, which includes a self-portrait among the onlookers, and especially the perspective cityscape which includes reference to Peter's ministry to Rome by the presence of two triumphal arches, and centrally placed an octagonal building that might be a Christian baptistry or a Roman Mausoleum.\n\nThe High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective, the realistic depiction of both physical and psychological features, and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, sfumato (softening the transition between colours) and chiaroscuro (contrast between light and dark), in a single unifying style which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony. In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to a dynamic whole. Painting of the High Renaissance is considered to be the absolute zenith of western painting and achieved the balancing and reconciliation, in harmony, of contradictory and seemingly mutually exclusive artistic positions, such as real versus ideal, movement versus rest, freedom versus law, space versus plane, and line versus colour. \n\nMost art historians state that the High Renaissance started around 1495 or 1500 and ended in 1520 with the death of Raphael, although some say the High Renaissance ended about 1525 or in 1527 with the Sack of Rome by the army of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, or about 1530. Many cite Leonardo da Vinci's the \"Last Supper\", started in 1495 and completed in 1498, as being the first work of the High Renaissance. In his book, \"A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture and Architecture\", 1985, Frederick Hartt states that 1520 to 1530 was a transition period between the High Renaissance and Mannerism. The High Renaissance was dominated by three painters - Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael; while Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione and Titian were the leaders of Venetian High Renaissance painting, with Correggio and Andrea de Sarto being other significant painters of the High Renaissance style.\n\nLeonardo (1452-1519) spent his formative years training in the Florence workshop of Verrocchio before moving Milan where he worked from 1482-1499 before spending 1500-1506 back in Florence. Because of the scope of his interests and the extraordinary degree of talent that he demonstrated in so many diverse areas, he is regarded as the archetypal \"Renaissance man\". But it was first and foremost as a painter that he was admired in his own time, and as a painter, he drew on the knowledge he gained from his other interests.\n\nLeonardo was a scientific observer. He learned by looking at things. He studied and drew the flowers of the fields, the eddies of the river, the form of the rocks and mountains, the way light reflected from foliage and sparkled in a jewel. In particular, he studied the human form, dissecting thirty or more unclaimed cadavers from a hospital in order to understand muscles and sinews.\n\nLeonardo achieved a degree of realism in the expression of human emotion, prefigured by Giotto but unknown since Masaccio's \"Adam and Eve\". Leonardo's \"Last Supper\", painted from 1495-1498 in the refectory of a monastery in Milan, became the benchmark for religious narrative painting for the next half millennium. Many other Renaissance artists painted versions of \"the Last Supper\", but only Leonardo's was destined to be reproduced countless times in wood, alabaster, plaster, lithograph, tapestry, crochet and table-carpets.\n\nMore than any other artist, he advanced the study and painting of \"atmosphere\". In his paintings such as the \"Mona Lisa\" (c.1503-1517) and \"Virgin of the Rocks\" (1483-1486) (the earliest complete work fully of his hand), he used light and shade with such subtlety that, for want of a better word, it became known as Leonardo's \"sfumato\" or \"smoke\". He exhibited a revolutionary use of colour by defining the transition between figures by colour modulation instead of by actual lines. His work invited the viewer into a mysterious world of shifting shadows, chaotic mountains and whirling torrents. Another significant work of Leonardo's was \"The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne\" (c.1503-1519); the monumental three-dimensional quality of the group and the calculated effects of dynamism and tension in the composition made it a model that inspired Classicists and the Mannerists in equal measure. Apart from the direct impact of the works themselves, Leonardo's studies of light, anatomy, landscape, and human expression were disseminated in part through his generosity to a retinue of students.\n\nIn 1508 Pope Julius II succeeded in getting the Florentine sculptor Michelangelo (1475-1564) to agree to continue the decorative scheme of the Sistine Chapel. The Sistine Chapel ceiling was constructed in such a way that there were twelve sloping pendentives supporting the vault that formed ideal surfaces on which to paint the Twelve Apostles. Michelangelo soon devised an entirely different scheme, far more complex both in design and in iconography. The scale of the work, which he executed single handed except for manual assistance, was titanic and took nearly five years to complete.\n\nThe Pope's plan for the Apostles would thematically have formed a pictorial link between the Old Testament and New Testament narratives on the walls, and the popes in the gallery of portraits. It is the twelve apostles, and their leader Peter as first Bishop of Rome, that make that bridge. But Michelangelo's scheme went the opposite direction. The theme of Michelangelo's ceiling is not God's grand plan for humanity's salvation. The theme is about humanity's disgrace. It is about why humanity and the faith needed Jesus.\n\nSuperficially, the ceiling is a Humanist construction. The figures are of superhuman dimension and, in the case of Adam, of such beauty that according to the biographer Vasari, it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he certainly has not presented the Humanist ideal of platonic love. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.\n\nVasari praised Michelangelo's seemingly infinite powers of invention in creating postures for the figures. Raphael, who was given a preview by Bramante after Michelangelo had downed his brush and stormed off to Bologna in a temper, painted at least two figures in imitation of Michelangelo's prophets, one at the church of Sant' Agostino and the other in the Vatican, his portrait of Michelangelo himself in \"The School of Athens\".\n\nMichelangelo's later work, \"The Last Judgement\", painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541, shows a Mannerist style, with generally elongated bodies, which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.\n\nWith Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, Raphael's (1483-1520) name is synonymous with the High Renaissance, although he was younger than Michelangelo by 18 years and Leonardo by almost 30 and died at the age of 37 just one year after Leonardo. It cannot be said that he greatly advanced the state of painting as his two famous contemporaries did. Rather, his work was the culmination of all the developments of the High Renaissance.\n\nRaphael was born the son of a painter, so his career path, unlike that of Michelangelo who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the Umbrian workshop of Perugino, an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first signed and dated painting, executed at the age of 21, is the \"Betrothal of the Virgin\", which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's \"Christ giving the Keys to Peter\". \n\nRaphael, who moved to Florence in 1504 and to Rome in 1508, unashamedly drew on the skills of the renowned painters whose lifespans encompassed his. In his works the individual qualities of numerous different painters are drawn together. The rounded forms and luminous colours of Perugino, the lifelike portraiture of Ghirlandaio, the realism and lighting of Leonardo, and the powerful draughtsmanship of Michelangelo became unified in the paintings of Raphael. In his short life he executed a number of large altarpieces, an impressive Classical fresco of the sea nymph, Galatea, outstanding portraits with two popes and a famous writer among them, and, while Michelangelo was painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling, a series of wall frescoes in the Vatican chambers nearby, of which \"the School of Athens\" (1509-11) in the Stanza della Segnaturais is uniquely significant.\n\nThis fresco depicts a meeting of all the most learned ancient Athenians, gathered in a grand classical setting around the central figure of Plato, whom Raphael has famously modelled upon Leonardo da Vinci. The brooding figure of Heraclitus who sits by a large block of stone, is a portrait of Michelangelo, and is a reference to the latter's painting of the Prophet Jeremiah in the Sistine Chapel. His own portrait is to the right, beside his teacher, Perugino.\n\nBut the main source of Raphael's popularity was not his major works, but his small Florentine pictures of the Madonna and Christ Child. Over and over he painted, in slightly different poses, a similar plump, calm-faced blonde woman and her chubby babies the most famous probably being \"La Belle Jardinière\" (\"The Madonna of the Beautiful Garden\"), now in the Louvre. His larger work, the \"Sistine Madonna\", used as a design for countless stained glass windows, has come, in the 21st century, to provide the iconic image of two small cherubs which has been reproduced on everything from paper table napkins to umbrellas.\n\n A leader of the Venetian School of painting, Giovanni Bellini (1430-1516) was born within a year of his brother Gentile, his brother-in-law Mantegna and Antonello da Messina, but lived a decade longer than the first two and almost three decades longer than the latter. He was painting right up until his death and his works illustrate several influences. His early works show the influence of Mantegna with incisive lines and clearly delineated colours while after Messina's stay in Venice in 1475-1476 his works adopted a Flemish-like realism and luminous colours, which shows he was highly successful at adopting the techniques of oil painting brought by Messina. He was first the teacher of Giorgione and Titian but was later influenced by Giorgione, most notably in adopting tonalism wherein paint is applied in superimposed layers creating a soft diffused effect so figures and landscapes become more unified in atmosphere. \n\nBellini became the only great 15th-century painter to cross the threshold from the Early Renaissance to the High Renaissance style with works such as \"Portrait of Doge Leonardo Loredan\" (1501), wherein the Doge shows a calmness Bellini likely learned from Messina, and \"Baptism of Christ\" (1500–1502). Bellini, like Raphael, also produced numerous small Madonnas in rich glowing colour, usually of more intense tonality than his Florentine counterpart. \n\nTraditionally, in the painting of altarpieces of the \"Madonna and Child\", the enthroned figure of the Virgin is accompanied by saints, who stand in defined spaces, separated physically in the form of a polytych or defined by painted architectural boundaries. Piero della Francesca used the Classical niche as a setting for his enthroned Madonnas (with saints grouped around the throne), as Masaccio had used it as the setting for his \"Holy Trinity\" at Santa Maria Novella. \n\nBellini used this same form, known as \"Sacred Conversations\", in several of his later altarpieces such as that for the Venetian church of San Zaccaria (1505). It is a masterful composition which uses tonalism and extends the real architecture of the building into the illusionistic architecture of the painting, making the niche a sort of loggia opened up to the landscape and to daylight which streams across the figures of the Virgin and Child, the two female saints and the little angel who plays a viola making them brighter than Saint Peter and Saint Jerome in the foreground.\n\nDespite the brevity of his career (he died in 1510 at about 35) and the low number of works universally agreed to be totally by his hand (as low as 4 or 5), Giorgione is often credited as being the founder of the Venetian High Renaissance style, although different scholars cite different reasons for asserting this. \n\nOne is his increasing use of gradations of colour and light (colour modulation), including sfumato, often achieved by tonalism, to define the shapes of figures and landscapes and to create an atmosphere wherein all components of the painting are unified. Some believe he may have been taught this by Leonardo da Vinci who is said to have visited Venice in 1501. In his \"Castelfranco Madonna\", 1505, the use of line and colour modulation are equally balanced but in \"The Tempest\", c.1510, colour modulation almost entirely replaces line creating an artistic vision in which humankind and nature are combined. Some consider the \"Tempest\" one of the most important paintings produced in Italy as the components are held together by colour and there is a dreamy atmosphere of perfect harmony. Giorgione was the first painter to assign a leading role to nature and whenever his paintings feature a landscape it becomes an integral part of the painting. \n\nThe \"Castelfranco Madonna\", when compared to Giovanni Bellini's similar The \"San Zaccaria Altarpiece\", illustrates another innovation of Giorgione - adjusting the directions and positions of the figures, such as the lance held by St. Liberale to the left and the folds in the Madonna's robe being placed in parallel, to more unify the subjects. Lastly, Giorgione's paintings are always ambiguous in their meaning and open to different interpretations. In \"The Tempest\", the naked woman feeding a baby and the clothed man, and a flash of lightning, perhaps represents Adam and Eve in their post-Eden days, or perhaps it does not. Another painting attributed to him, \"The Three Philosophers\", may represent the Magi planning their journey in search of the infant Christ, or it may not. None of Giorgione's paintings has ever had a certain interpretation. \n\nUntil recent years, it had appeared certain that Giorgione painted the very first female nude that stands, or rather, lies, as a subject to be portrayed and admired for beauty alone with the \"Sleeping Venus\", 1510. While it had been long accepted that Titian finished the landscape of the painting after Giorgione's death, many art scholars are increasingly questioning if Giorgione painted the entire female body.\n\nTitian (c. 1490-1576) trained in the workshop of Giovanni Bellini alongside Giorgione and then assisted Giorgione. Following Giorgione’s death, he was the monarch of the Venetian School for over 60 years. His early work shows strong influences of Bellini and Giorgione, but he soon he took the principles of form and colour announced by those two and established colour, not line, as the major determinant in painting thereby consummating the Venetian High Renaissance style. He did this by applying colours of paint paste-like in patches alongside each other with loose and sweeping brush strokes. This brought out the light and colour in equal measure at the same time; he was famous in his own day as the master of light and colour.\n\nAnother strength of Titian was the composition of his paintings. In the Pesaro Madonna, 1519-1526, he moves the Madonna from the centre instead placing her at the upper vertex of a powerful diagonal line (as opposed to the usual vertical or horizontal) which still focuses the attention on the Madonna. This was one of the first works to group figures in an circular, ascending structure.\n\nAssumption of the Virgin, 1516-1518, also features diagonal lines (shaped by the cherubs located around the Virgin) which carries the triumphant message of the painting upward into the upper levels of the Church of Frari in Venice on whose altar it stands. This work was the first to have visual suggestion of movement; all of Titian’s works have a new dynamism in the movements of people compared to the static elements of other High Renaissance painters. The Assumption of the Virgin also features, like all of his paintings, glowing, deep, rich colours due to Titian’s applying layer after layer of paint, sometimes of different colours. \n\nTitian was also the most sought after portraitist of his time and brought portraiture to the same level of esteem as narrative painting. Highly notable are the \"Equestrian Portrait of Charles V\",1548, an equestrian picture in a symphony of purples, and the portrait of Doge Andrea Gritti, ruler of Venice, perhaps Titian's most powerful portrait. \n\nAs Titian aged, he maintained a generally High Renaissance style until his last years, when figure was almost completed dissolved in the movement of colour, so he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of Italian painting which had moved almost completely towards Mannerism by 1530. In many ways, Titian can be considered the founder of modern painting.\n\nCorreggio (1489-1534), who never visited Rome, but must have seen the works of the Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian, worked in a personal High Renaissance style in Parma in Northern Italy. He invented the open heaven filled with floating figures church dome which became a hallmark of the 17th Century Baroque period with his \"Vision of St. John the Evangelist\", 1520-1524, in Parma’s San Giovanni Evangelista, and the \"Assumption of the Virgin\", 1526-1530, in Parma Cathedral. One art scholar states that in the latter, Correggio creates a “dazzling illusion: the architecture of the dome seems to dissolve and the form seems to explode through the building drawing the viewer up into the swirling vortex of saints and angels who rush upwards to accompany the Virgin in to heaven.” \n\nIn those domes and other works, his bold use of perspective, usually by setting a dark colour against light colours to enhance the illusion of depth, is described as astonishing. His chief interest was painting light and he anticipates the effects to be achieved by Caravaggio at the start of the next century. His mastery of foreshortening (causing objects to look shorter because they are angled to the viewer) to create perspective is described as perhaps the most skillful ever. \n\nIn \"Jupiter and Io\", 1531-1532, Correggio painted a strong contrast between the luminous figure of Io and the soft but dark clouds filling the sky, which seem to envelop Io’s gleaming body. Correggio was able to execute the diffuse effect of clouds, haze or mist perfectly and together with colour modulation infuses his characters with a distinct sense of weightlessness. He painted flesh in a delicate, voluptuous manner that has never been surpassed and presents a new concept of feminine beauty only rediscovered during the Rococo period. Correggio had many pupils but none carried on his style but he prefigured many components of Baroque painting.\n\nAndrea del Sarto (1486-1530), a Florentine, drew upon both Michelangelo and Raphael in his work, but went far beyond them in the portrayal of facial expressions and gestures, as evidenced in \"Madonna of the Harpies\",1517. His figures show a greater individuality than earlier High Renaissance works while losing none of the nobility. In the 1520s, he remained faithful to the ideals of the High Renaissance, such as in paintings’ compositions and with the faces of his figures usually being calm and often beautiful, showing none of the torment of his Mannerist contemporaries, some of whom were his pupils. \n\nLorenzo Lotto (1480-1556), one of the most important High Renaissance painters in Venice, also spent time in other areas of Northern Italy as, perhaps due to his greater focus on realist detail and on line than rather than colour compared to the Venetian school, he was not much appreciated in Venice. While he painted a variety of subjects, he was an excellent portrait painter who had a superior ability to see into the soul of his subjects and to portray a depth of feeling in the painting. He usually included other objects in the background or foreground of the portrait to portray the subject's character. \n\nThe lives of both Michelangelo and Titian extended well into the second half of the 16th century. Both saw their styles and those of Leonardo, Mantegna, Giovanni Bellini, Antonello da Messina and Raphael adapted by later painters to form a disparate style known as Mannerism, and move steadily towards the great outpouring of imagination and painterly virtuosity of the Baroque period.\n\nThe artists who most extended the trends in Titian's large figurative compositions were Tintoretto and Veronese, although Tintoretto is considered by many to be a Mannerist. Rembrandt's knowledge of the works of both Titian and Raphael is apparent in his portraits. The direct influences of Leonardo and Raphael upon their own pupils was to effect generations of artists including Poussin and schools of Classical painters of the 18th and 19th centuries. Antonello da Messina's work had a direct influence on Albrecht Dürer and Martin Schongauer and through the latter's engravings, countless artists including the German, Dutch and English schools of stained glass makers extending into the early 20th century.\n\nMichelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling and later \"The Last Judgment\" had direct influence on the figurative compositions firstly of Raphael and his pupils and then almost every subsequent 16th-century painter who looked for new and interesting ways to depict the human form. It is possible to trace his style of figurative composition through Andrea del Sarto, Pontormo, Bronzino, Parmigianino, Veronese, to el Greco, Carracci, Caravaggio, Rubens, Poussin and Tiepolo to both the Classical and the Romantic painters of the 19th century such as Jacques-Louis David and Delacroix.\n\nUnder the influence of the Italian Renaissance painting, many modern academies of art, such as the Royal Academy, were founded, and it was specifically to collect the works of the Italian Renaissance that some of the world's best known art collections, such as the National Gallery, London, were formed.\n\n\n\n"}

A prominent feminist art historian, she became well known for her pioneering 1971 article \"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\".\n\nLinda Natalie Weinberg was born the daughter of Jules Weinberg and Elka Heller (Weinberg) in Brooklyn, New York and raised in the borough's Crown Heights neighborhood. She attended Brooklyn Ethical Cultural School, a progressive grammar school. She received her B.A. in Philosophy from Vassar College in 1951, her M.A. in English from Columbia University in 1952, and her Ph.D in the history of art from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University in 1963.\n\nAfter working in the art history departments at Yale University, the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (with Rosalind Krauss), and Vassar College, Nochlin took a position at the Institute of Fine Arts, where she taught until retiring in 2013. In 2000, \"Self and History: A Tribute to Linda Nochlin\" was published, an anthology of essays developing themes that Nochlin worked on throughout her career.\n\nHer critical attention was drawn to investigating the ways in which gender affects the creation and apprehension of art, as evidenced by her 1994 essay \"Issues of Gender in Cassatt and Eakins\". Besides feminist art history, she was best known for her work on Realism, specifically on Gustave Courbet.\n\nComplementing her career as an academic, she served on the Art Advisory Council of the International Foundation for Art Research.\n\nNochlin was the co-curator of a number of landmark exhibitions exploring the history and achievements of female artists. \n\nIn 1971, \"ArtNews\" published Nochlin's essay \"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\" in which she explored assumptions embedded in the title's question. She considered the very nature of art along with the reasons why the notion of artistic genius has been reserved for male geniuses such as Michelangelo. Nochlin argued that significant societal barriers have prevented women from pursuing art, including restrictions on educating women in art academies and \"the entire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the profession of art history is based \". The thirty-year anniversary of Nochlin's ground-breaking inquiry informed a conference at Princeton University in 2001. The book associated with the conference, \"Women artists at the Millennium\", includes Nochlin's essay \"\"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\" Thirty Years After\". In the conference and in the book, art historians addressed the innovative work of such figures as Louise Bourgeois, Eva Hesse, Francesca Woodman, Carrie Mae Weems and Mona Hatoum in the light of the legacies of thirty years of feminist art history.\n\nIn her 1994 essay \"Starting from Scratch: The Beginnings of Feminist Art History,\" Nochlin reflected on her awakening as a feminist and its impact on her scholarship and teaching: \"In 1969, three major events occurred in my life: I had a baby, I became a feminist, and I organized the first class in Women and Art at Vassar College.\"\n\nNochlin deconstructed art history by identifying and questioning methodological presuppositions. She was an advocate for \"art historians who investigate the work before their eyes while focusing on its subject matter, informed by a sensitivity to its feminist spirit.\"\n\nFollowing Edward Said's influential 1978 book, \"Orientalism\", Nochlin was one of the first art historians to apply theories of Orientalism to the study of art history, specifically in her 1983 paper, \"The Imaginary Orient.\" Her key assertion was that Orientalism must be seen from the point-of-view of 'the particular power structure in which these works came into being,\" in this case, 19th century French colonialism. Nochlin focused primarily on the 19th century French artists Jean-Leon Gérôme and Eugène Delacroix, who both depicted 'orientalist' themes in their work, including, respectively, The Snake Charmer and The Death of Sardanapalus. In Gérôme's \"The Snake Charmer,\" from the late 1860s, Nochlin described how Gérôme created a sense of verisimilitude not only in his rendering of the scene with such realistic precision one almost forgets a painter painted it, but in capturing the most minute details, such as meticulously painted tiles. As a result, the painting appears to be documentary evidence of life in the Ottoman court while, according to Nochlin, it is in fact a Westerner's vision of a mysterious world. In Delacroix's \"The Death of Sardanapalus\" from 1827, Nochlin argued that the artist used Orientalism to explore overt erotic and violent themes that may not necessarily reflect France's cultural hegemony but rather the chauvinism and misogyny of early 19th century French society.\n\nNochlin married twice. First, in 1953 she married Philip H. Nochlin, an assistant professor of Philosophy at Vassar, who died seven years later. She then married Richard Pommer, an architectural historian, in 1968. Nochlin had two daughters: Jessica, with Philip Nochlin, and Daisy, with Richard Pommer, who was depicted with Nochlin by the artist Alice Neel in 1973.\n\nLinda Nochlin died at age 86 on October 29, 2017.\n\n\nNochlin's published writings encompass 156 works in 280 publications in 12 languages and 20,393 library holdings. \n\n\n"}

Ordinary citizens receive food rations and electricity.\n\nThe Party Founding Day is one of the most important holidays of the country, along with the Day of the Sun (birthday of Kim Il-sung), Day of the Shining Star (birthday of Kim Jong-il) and Day of the Foundation of the Republic. 2015 marked the 70th anniversary.\n\nNorth Korea commemorates 10 October 1945 as the date of the foundation of the \"Central Organizing Committee of the Communist Party of North Korea\", known as the \"North Korea Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea\" by Western historians.\n\nOn 10 October 1945 a meeting called \"Conference of Korean Communist Party Members and Enthusiasts in the Five Northwestern Provinces\" began in Pyongyang, in a public hall that now hosts the Party Founding Museum. On 13 October, the meeting saw the establishment of the North Korea Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea. The conference was the first time that Kim Il-sung emerged as a political force. Kim advocated the foundation of the North Korea Bureau so that party activities could be overseen in the north of the country in a situation where the north and south were occupied by the Soviets and the Americans respectively. Kim acceded the chairmanship of the North Korea Bureau some two months after the conference. The Bureau soon became independent of the Seoul-lead Communist Party of Korea, paving the way for a political force in the North.\n\nThe North Korea Bureau is one in a series of predecessors to the present Workers' Party of Korea. The North Korea Bureau evolved into the Workers' Party of North Korea in August 1946. The present Workers' Party of Korea was not founded until 30 June 1949 when the Workers' Party of North Korea merged with the Workers' Party of South Korea.\n\nCelebrations include song and dance performances, evening galas, speeches, lectures on revolutionary history and oratorical meetings. Floral tributes are laid in front of statues of Kim Il-sung. Special food rations are distributed. This usually includes foodstuffs that are normally in short supply, such as oil and snacks. Meat is available through the public distribution system.\n\nElectricity is provided on the Party Foundation Day, despite shortages. There are live TV broadcasts of ceremonies. The holiday is celebrated throughout the country, though main celebrations take place in the capital, Pyongyang. The city typically hosts processions and a military parade during the day. Attendance in festivities in the capital is counted in the millions.\n\nThe celebrations have included occasional ceremonial visits of North Korean leaders to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun. The failure of Kim Jong-un to appear in 2014 intensified speculations of his lengthy absence. The tradition has not been very strong, as in comparison to Kim Jong-un, his father Kim Jong-il observed the same tradition only twice.\n\nNorth Korea schedules completion of large-scale construction projects to coincide with important anniversaries like the Party Foundation Day. The 1995 50th anniversary of the party, for instance, was met with unveiling of the Monument to Party Founding. The 70th anniversary in 2015 was planned to be celebrated with the completion of a stock breeding base and a power plant: the Sepho Tableland and the Chongchon River Power Plant. The latter was finished by the next month.\n\nBanks, offices, retail and government institutions close for the day. Weddings are often organized on the day.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "149281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=149281", "title": "Performance art", "text": "Performance art\n\nPerformance art is a performance presented to an audience within a fine art context, traditionally interdisciplinary. Performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated, spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation. The performance can be live or via media; the performer can be present or absent. It can be any situation that involves four basic elements: time, space, the performer's body, or presence in a medium, and a relationship between performer and audience. Performance art can happen anywhere, in any type of venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.\n\nPerformance art is an essentially contested concept: any single definition of it implies the recognition of rival uses. As concepts like \"democracy\" or \"art\", it implies productive disagreement with itself.\n\nThe meaning of the term in the narrower sense is related to postmodernist traditions in Western culture. From about the mid-1960s into the 1970s, often derived from concepts of visual art, with respect to Antonin Artaud, Dada, the Situationists, Fluxus, installation art and conceptual art, performance art tended to be defined as an antithesis to theatre, challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms. The ideal had been an ephemeral and authentic experience for performer and audience in an event that could not be repeated, captured or purchased. The widely discussed difference, how concepts of visual arts and concepts of performing arts are utilized, can determine the meanings of a performance art presentation.\n\nPerformance art is a term usually reserved to refer to a conceptual art which conveys a content-based meaning in a more drama-related sense, rather than being simple performance for its own sake for entertainment purposes. It largely refers to a performance presented to an audience, but which does not seek to present a conventional theatrical play or a formal linear narrative, or which alternately does not seek to depict a set of fictitious characters in formal scripted interactions. It therefore can include action or spoken word as a communication between the artist and audience, or even ignore expectations of an audience, rather than following a script written beforehand.\n\nSome kinds of performance art nevertheless can be close to performing arts. Such performance may utilize a script or create a fictitious dramatic setting, but still constitute performance art in that it does not seek to follow the usual dramatic norm of creating a fictitious setting with a linear script which follows conventional real-world dynamics; rather, it would intentionally seek to satirize or to transcend the usual real-world dynamics which are used in conventional theatrical plays.\n\nPerformance artists often challenge the audience to think in new and unconventional ways, break conventions of traditional arts, and break down conventional ideas about \"what art is\". As long as the performer does not become a player who repeats a role, performance art can include satirical elements; utilize robots and machines as performers, as in pieces of the Survival Research Laboratories; involve ritualised elements (e.g. Shaun Caton); or borrow elements of any performing arts such as dance, music, and circus.\n\nSome artists, e.g. the Viennese Actionists and neo-Dadaists, prefer to use the terms \"live art\", \"action art\", \"actions\", \"intervention\" (see art intervention) or \"manoeuvre\" to describe their performing activities. As genres of performance art appear body art, fluxus-performance, happening, action poetry, and intermedia.\n\nPerformance art activity is not confined to European or American art traditions; notable practitioners can be found in Asia and Latin America. Performance artists and theorists point to different traditions and histories, ranging from tribal to sporting and ritual or religious events. In an episode of \"In Our Time\" broadcast on Thu, 20 Oct 2005, 21:30 on BBC Radio 4, Angie Hobbs, Lecturer in Philosophy, University of Warwick; Miriam Griffin, Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford; and John Moles, Professor of Latin, University of Newcastle discussed with Melvyn Bragg the idea that Antisthenes and Diogenes in ancient Greece practiced a form of performance art and that they acquired the epithet of cynic which means \"dog\" due to Diogenes behaving repeatedly like a dog in his performances.\n\nWestern cultural theorists often trace performance art activity back to the beginning of the 20th century, to the Russian constructivists, Futurists and Dada. Dada provided a significant progenitor with the unconventional performances of poetry, often at the Cabaret Voltaire, by the likes of Richard Huelsenbeck and Tristan Tzara. Russian Futurist artists could be identified as precursors of performance, such as David Burliuk, who painted his face for his actions (1910–20) and Alexander Rodchenko and his wife Varvara Stepanova.\n\nAccording to the art critic Harold Rosenberg in the 1940s and 1950s Action Painting gave artists the freedom to perform—the canvas as \"an arena in which to act\", thereby rendering the paintings as traces of the artist's performance in his/her studio. Abstract expressionism and Action painting preceded the Fluxus movement, Happenings and the emergence of Performance Art.\n\nPerformance art was anticipated, if not explicitly formulated, by Japan's Gutai group of the 1950s, especially in such works as Atsuko Tanaka's \"Electric Dress\" (1956).\n\nYves Klein had been a precursor of performance art with the conceptual pieces of \"Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle\" (\"Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility\") 1959–62, \"Anthropométries\" (1960), and works like the photomontage, Saut dans le vide (Leap into the Void). In the late 1960s Earth artists as diverse as Robert Smithson, Dennis Oppenheim, Michael Heizer and Carl Andre created environmental pieces that predict the performance art of the 1970s. Works of conceptual artists in the early 1980s, like Sol LeWitt, who converted mural-style drawing into an act of performance by others, were influenced by Yves Klein and the Earth artists as well.\n\nIn the 1960s a variety of new works, concepts and the increasing number of artists led to new kinds of performance art. Prototypic for the artform later explicitly labeled \"performance art\", were works of artists like Yoko Ono with her \"Wall piece for orchestra\" (1962), Carolee Schneemann with pieces like \"Meat Joy\" (1964) and \"Interior Scroll\" (1975); Wolf Vostell with his Happening \"YOU\" (1964 in New York); Joseph Beuys with \"How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare\" (1965); Yayoi Kusama, with actions such as a naked flag-burning on the Brooklyn Bridge (1968) and Allan Kaprow in his many \"Happenings\".\n\nKaprow had coined the term Happening describing a new artform, at the beginning of the 1960s. A \"Happening\" allows the artist to experiment with body motion, recorded sounds, written and spoken texts, and even smells. One of Kaprow's earliest was \"Happenings in the New York Scene,\" written in 1961 as the form was developing. Notably in the Happenings of Allan Kaprow, the audience members become performers. While the audiences in Happenings had been welcomed as the performers, it is only sometimes and often unwittingly that they become an active part in a Performance. Other artists who created Happenings besides Kaprow include Jim Dine, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Whitman, and Wolf Vostell: \"Theater is in the Street\" (Paris in 1958).\n\nHermann Nitsch in 1962 presented his \"Theatre of Orgies and Mysteries\" (Orgien- und Mysterien Theater), a precursor to performance art, close to the performing arts.\n\nAndy Warhol during the early 1960s beginning to create films and video, in the mid-60s sponsored the Velvet Underground and staged events and performances in New York, like the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (1966) that featured live Rock music, exploding lights, and film.\n\nIndirectly influential for art-world performance, particularly in the United States, were new forms of theatre, embodied by the San Francisco Mime Troupe and the Living Theatre and showcased in Off-Off Broadway theaters in SoHO and at La MaMa in New York City. The Living Theatre chiefly toured in Europe between 1963 and 1968, and in the U.S. in 1968. A work of this period, \"Paradise Now\" was notorious for its audience participation and a scene in which actors recited a list of social taboos that included nudity, while disrobing.\n\nThe work of performance artists after 1968 often showed influences of the cultural and political events of that year. Barbara T. Smith with \"Ritual Meal\" (1969) was at the forefront of the feminist body-, and performance art of the 1970s; among others including: Carolee Schneemann, and Joan Jonas. Schneemann and Jonas along with Yoko Ono, Joseph Beuys, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Allan Kaprow, Vito Acconci, Chris Burden and Dennis Oppenheim pioneered the relationship between \"Body art\" and performance art.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, artists whose work already before tended to be a performance art, as well as new artists, began to present performance art in a stricter form.\n\nNew artists with radical performances were Chris Burden, with the 1971 performance piece \"Shoot\", in which he was shot in his left arm by an assistant from a distance of about five meters, and Vito Acconci in the same year with \"Seedbed\".\n\nThe book \"Expanded Cinema\", by Gene Youngblood, marked a shift in the use of media by performance artists. The first book considering video art as an art form, mentions Jud Yalkut as a pioneering video artist. Since 1965 he had collaborated in dozens of intermedia performances throughout the United States, also with Nam June Paik, who beginning of the 1960s already had been a fluxus performer on the way to become a media artist. As to the art of Paik, Youngblood refers to works of Carolee Schneemann and Robert Whitman from the 1960s, which had been pioneering for performance art, becoming an independent artform at the beginning of the 1970s.\n\nThe British-based pair Gilbert and George, already in 1970, had documented actions of themselves on video, and created their \"living sculpture\" performance, being painted in gold and singing \"Underneath The Arches\" for extended periods. Joan Jonas began to include video in her experimental performances in 1972.\n\nIn 1973, Laurie Anderson performed \"Duets on Ice\", on the streets of New York City. Marina Abramović, in the performance \"Rhythm 10\", conceptually included the violation of her body. Thirty years later, the theme of violation, shame, and sexual exploitation would be re-imagined in the contemporary performance works of artists such as Clifford Owens, Gillian Walsh, Pat Oleszko and Rebecca Patek, among others.\n\nSince 1973, the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman's Building in Los Angeles had a formative impact on the wave of performances with feminist background.\n\nCarolee Schneemann work in 1963, \"Eye Body\", already had been a prototype of performance art. Schneemann in 1975 drew on with innovative solo performances, like \"Interior Scroll\", showing the female body as an artistic medium.\n\nIn the mid seventies, behind the iron curtain, in the Eastern European capitals: Budapest, Kraków, Belgrade, Zagreb, Novi Sad and other cities, the performing art was flourishing. Against the political and social control, emerged Orshi Drozdik performance series, titled \"Individual Mythology\" 1975/77 and the \"NudeModel\" 1976/77. Critical of the patriarchal discourse of art and the equally patriarchal state forced \"emancipation program\", pioneering feminist point of view on both, made her forerunner in the 70s political and artistic environment.\n\nIn 1976, HA Schult filled St. Mark's Square in Venice with old newspapers in an overnight action he called \"Venezia vive.\" In his 1977 performance, \"Crash\", the same artist let a Cessna crash into the garbage dump on Staten Island, New York.\n\nPerformance art, because of its relative transience, by the 1970s, had a fairly robust presence in the avant-garde of Eastern Bloc countries, especially Poland and Yugoslavia.\n\nUntil the 1980s, performance art had been demystifying virtuosity. Now it began to embrace technical brilliance. In reference to \"Presence and Resistance\" by Philip Auslander, dance critic Sally Banes writes \"... by the end of the 1980s, performance art had become so widely known that it no longer needed to be defined; mass culture, especially television, had come to supply both structure and subject matter for much performance art; and several performance artists, including Laurie Anderson, Spalding Gray, Eric Bogosian, Willem Dafoe, and Ann Magnuson, had indeed become crossover artists in mainstream entertainment.\"\n\nDespite the fact that many performances are held within the circle of a small art-world group, RoseLee Goldberg notes in \"Performance Art: From Futurism to the Present\" that \"performance has been a way of appealing directly to a large public, as well as shocking audiences into reassessing their own notions of art and its relation to culture. Conversely, public interest in the medium, especially in the 1980s, stems from an apparent desire of that public to gain access to the art world, to be a spectator of its ritual and its distinct community, and to be surprised by the unexpected, always unorthodox presentations that the artists devise.\"\n\nAmong the performance art most discussed in the art-world of this decade were a performance by Linda Montano and Tehching Hsieh between July 1983 and July 1984, \"Art/Life: One Year Performance\" (Rope Piece), and Karen Finley's \"I'm an Ass Man\" 1987.\n\nUntil the decline of the European eastern block during the late 1980s, performance art had actively been rejected by most communist governments. With the exception of Poland and Yugoslavia, performance art was more or less banned in countries where any independent public event was feared. In the GDR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Latvia it happened in apartments, at seemingly spontaneous gatherings in artist studios, in church-controlled settings, or covered as another activity, like a photo-shooting. Isolated of the western conceptual context, in different settings it could be like a playful protest or like a bitter comment, using subversive metaphors to express dissent with the political situation.\n\nPrior to 1982, Hedwig Gorski designated the term performance poetry, to distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time. Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1994, the Dutch visual artist PINK de Thierry created what she came to call meta-performances: a conceptual mix of intervention art in public space, performance art—interacting with an audience, installation art—utilizing large structures to perform in or with, and media art—photography and film to register and exhibit.\n\nWhile the Soviet bloc disintegrated, formerly repressed activities of performance artists like György Galántai in Hungary, or the Collective Action Group in Russia, became better known. Young artists from all over the former Eastern bloc, including Russia, turned to performance. Performance art at about the same time appeared in Cuba, the Caribbean and China. Chinese performance artists like Zhang Huan had been performing underground since the late 1980s. In the early 1990s Chinese performance art already was acclaimed in the international art scene.\n\n\"In these contexts performance art became a critical new voice with a social force similar to that found in Western Europe, the United States and South America in the 1960s and early 1970s. It should be emphasized that the eruption of performance art in the 1990s in Eastern Europe, China, South Africa, Cuba, and elsewhere should never be considered either secondary to or imitative of the West.\"\n\nSince 1996, HA Schult has installed one thousand life sized \"Trash People\" made from garbage as \"silent witnesses to a consumer age that has created an ecological imbalance worldwide\". They travelled to Moscow's Red Square (1999), the Pyramids of Giza (2002) and the Great Wall of China (2001).\n\nIn the western world in the 1990s, even sophisticated performance art became part of the cultural mainstream: performance art as a complete artform gained admittance into art museums and became a museal topic.\n\nIn the second half of the decade, computer-aided forms of performance art began to take place.\n\nSince January 2003, Tate Modern in London has had a curated programme of live art and performance and in 2012 The Tanks at Tate Modern were opened: the first dedicated spaces for performance, film, and installation in a major modern and contemporary art museum.\n\nFrom March 14 to May 31, 2010, the Museum of Modern Art held a major retrospective and performance recreation of Marina Abramović's work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history. During the run of the exhibition, Abramović performed \"The Artist is Present\", a 736-hour and 30-minute static, silent piece, in which she sat immobile in the museum's atrium, while spectators were invited to take turns sitting opposite her. A support group for the \"sitters\", \"Sitting with Marina\", was established on Facebook. The performance attracted celebrities such as Björk and James Franco and received coverage on the internet. During Marina's performance, other artists performed for her.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7915498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7915498", "title": "Peter Hart (historian)", "text": "Peter Hart (historian)\n\nPeter Hart (11 November 1963 – 22 July 2010) was a Canadian historian, specialising in modern Irish history.\n\nHart was born and raised in St. John's, Newfoundland. He studied for one year at the Memorial University of Newfoundland before moving to study at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He graduated from there with an Honours BA degree. Subsequently, Hart completed a master's degree in International Relations at Yale University.\n\nHe then moved to Ireland to do PhD work at Trinity College, Dublin. His thesis was on the Irish Republican Army in County Cork, an epicenter of the Irish War of Independence, which was the basis of his first book, \"The IRA and its Enemies\". After completing his doctorate, Hart accepted a five-year teaching and research position at Queen's University Belfast. In 2003, having completed this contract, Hart moved back to Canada to take up the position of Canada Research Chair in Irish Studies at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. He was also an associate professor at Memorial University. \n\nIn the 1990s he developed cancer and underwent a liver transplant - events which permanently affected his health. He suffered a brain haemorrhage early in July 2010 and died on 22 July 2010 in a St. John's hospital at the age of 46.\n\nHart published several books on what he termed the \"Irish Revolution\" of 1916–23, arguing that events like the Easter Rising (1916), the Irish War of Independence (1920–21) and the Irish Civil War (1922–23) were parts of a greater whole.\n\nThe first was published in 1998 entitled \"The IRA and Its Enemies, Violence and Community in Cork, 1916–1923\", being a study of the organisation's social composition and activity in County Cork during the War of Independence. This book won several awards, including the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize (1998). It attracted significant criticism, \"le[ading] to almost as much conflict as the events\" described.\n\nIn 2002 Hart edited \"British Intelligence in Ireland 1920–21: the Final Reports\", a re-print of official British Government reports released to the British Public Records Office that detailed British military and intelligence analysis of policy during the Irish rebellion from 1919-1921.\n\n\"The I.R.A. at War 1916–1923\" (Oxford University Press, 2003), is a collection of essays on various social, political and military aspects of the IRA in these years. The publication represented, Hart wrote in its preface, \"sixteen years' work on the history of the Irish revolution.\"\n\nHart contributed to the volume \"The Irish Revolution\" (2002), a collection of articles by various historians of the period.\n\nHart's final published work was a biography of the Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins, entitled \"Mick - The Real Michael Collins\" (Macmillan, 2006).\n\n\"Times Higher Education\" suggested in 2008 that Hart's work \"offers a revisionist version of events that proved highly controversial\". Hart denied he was a \"revisionist\", calling it \"pejorative labelling\". In his review of \"The IRA and its Enemies: Violence and Community in Cork, 1916–1923\", John M. Regan wrote:\"Hart is neither a statist nor a southern nationalist, though the influence of both ideologies can be traced though his work. His research on localised and specialised topics subverts orthodoxy, but it is his willingness to embrace it when dealing with general explanations which surprises. His exploration of the plight of Protestants in the Free State illuminates the sectarian underbelly of the revolution that a nationalist historiography prefers to ignore. In escalating violence in Cork, Tipperary, or Dublin could Michael Collins, Harry Boland, or Ernie O'Malley be held accountable for raising sectarian tensions in Antrim, Down or Belfast? Was the cost of a southern state the institutionalisation of ethno-religious tensions in a compressed and reactionary northern state? Could revolutionary violence in 1922 and 1968 conceivably be part of one grotesque, protracted process? To accept this argument would, however, be to shatter nationalist icons important to a southern nationalist identity still rooted in its own glorious revolution.\"\n\nSome of Hart's published claims attracted criticism from other historians and writers, including two incidents in \"The IRA and its Enemies\". One was the Kilmichael Ambush of 28 November 1920. Hart challenged the account of commander Tom Barry who stated the Auxiliaries engaged in a false surrender that caused two IRA fatalities, after which Barry refused further surrender calls and ordered a fight to the finish without prisoners. Hart posited this never happened and alleged that Barry ordered the killing of all prisoners.\n\nHart claimed he personally interviewed two anonymous ambush veterans in 1988-89 and listened to recorded interviews with three further unnamed Kilmichael veterans. The recordings (known as 'the Chisholm tapes') were made in 1970 by Father John Chisholm as research for Liam Deasy's \"Toward Ireland Free\" (1973). Meda Ryan, author of \"Tom Barry, IRA Freedom Fighter\" (2003), questioned Hart's claim to have interviewed two Kilmichael veterans in 1988 and 1989, claiming only one, Edward \"Ned\" Young, was still alive from 1987-89. Ryan reported him too ill to have contributed to Hart's research. This assertion was supported in an affidavit published in 2008 by Ned Young's son, John. Ned Young died aged 97 on 13 November 1989. According to Ryan (and 1980s newspaper accounts) The second last surviving Kilmichael veteran, Jack O'Sullivan, died in December 1986. However, Hart dated an additional interview with his second anonymous Kilmichael veteran on 19 November 1989, six days after Ned Young died. Hart claimed his interviewee was an unarmed ambush scout, although the last ambush scout, Dan O'Driscoll, reportedly died in 1967. The last dispatch scout, Seán Falvey, died in 1971. Hart's earlier 1992 PhD thesis, on which his book is based, did not describe this 19 November 1989 interviewee as an unarmed scout. In his thesis, Hart described touring around the Kilmichael ambush site with this interviewee, a claim withdrawn from the book.\n\nNiall Meehan, Head of the Journalism and Media Faculty in Griffith College, Dublin, questioned Hart's claims with regard to the \"Chisholm tapes\", in a review of David Fitzpatrick (ed.), \"Terror in Ireland 1916-1923\" (2012). A chapter on the Kilmichael ambush by Eve Morrison was based partially on access to the tapes. She reported two (not three as Hart stated) Kilmichael veterans recorded in 1970 by Chisholm speaking on the ambush. One of these two was Ned Young. The other recorded interviewee, Jack O'Sullivan, spoke words which were misattributed by Hart to the ambush scout he claimed he interviewed on 19 November 1989. Meehan asserted that \"this misattribution... further questions the existence of Hart’s 1988 and 1989 veteran interviews\".\n\nThe second controversy surrounds the Dunmanway killings, in which thirteen Protestant men and boys were shot dead between 27–29 April 1922 during the truce. Hart wrote, \"these men were shot because they were Protestant\". Others point to evidence suggesting that, while the IRA action was unauthorised, the men were targeted due to allegations they were informers, not because of their religion. Again, criticism centered on Hart's use of evidence. In his review of \"The IRA and its Enemies\" (The Month, September–October 1998) Brian Murphy noted Hart's citation of a British intelligence assessment in the Record of the Rebellion in Ireland that \"in the south the Protestants and those who supported the Government rarely gave much information because, except by chance, they had not got it to give.\" Murphy pointed out that Hart had omitted the following sentence: \n\nAs the April killings took place in \"the Bandon area\", Brian Murphy queried apparent suppression of evidence contradicting Hart's conclusion. This has been echoed in further discussion.\n\nHart stood by his work, stating that critics have failed to \"engage with the book's larger arguments about the nature of the IRA and the Irish Revolution\" and believing they are closed to \"a real debate where people concede some things and put forward others or are skeptical about weak points and accept the strong points.\" Hart's last known interview was in a TG4 Irish language programme on Tom Barry, broadcast in January 2011. The programme had access to eight of nine Chisholm tapes (in total) and questioned Hart's use of anonymous sources and other claims.\n\nIn his 2011 book, \"Michael Collins and the Anglo-Irish War: Britain's Failed Counterinsurgency\", author J.B.E. Hittle, a retired U.S. career intelligence officer-turned historian, acknowledged Hart's overall contribution in re-examining standard histories of the period, but concluded that Hart's historical method is \"problematic\". Hittle cited Hart's \"overall naivete\" about guerrilla warfare, in particular, what he viewed as Hart's underestimation of the importance of certain counterintelligence cases to the outcome of the war, as well as faulty methodologies.\n\n\n"}

He was an officer in the Nationalist army and fought in the Burma campaigns. He earned a Ph.D in history from the University of Michigan, worked with Joseph Needham and is a contributor of Needham's \"Science and Civilisation in China\". Huang taught in the U.S., and is best known in his later years for the idea of macro-history.\n\nRay Huang was born in Ningxiang, Hunan Province, in 1918. He was the oldest of three children. His father, Huang Zhenbai (黄震白), was an early member of the revolutionary group, Tongmenghui, who became less active in the group over the years. Ray Huang grew up in Hunan and went to study electrical engineering at Nankai University, Tianjin in 1936. At the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938, he returned to Changsha and wrote for the \"Anti-Japanese War Report\" (《抗日战报》).\n\nAfterwards, he entered the Republic of China Military Academy (中華民國陸軍官校) at Chengdu, Sichuan, graduating in 1940. He was appointed Second Lieutenant Platoon Leader in 1941; he was a staff First Lieutenant stationed in India in 1942, and a Staff Major in the New First Army in the Burma theater from 1943-1945. While in Burma, he was shot through the thigh, but he made a complete recovery. After the war he attended the American Army Staff College (graduating in 1947), and was aide-de-camp to the head of the Chinese military delegation participating in the Allied occupation of Japan from 1949-1950. However, with the loss of mainland China in 1949, the Nationalist army in Taiwan was purged of political opponents in 1950. Huang's superior in Japan was accused of Communist links and as a result, Huang was discharged from the Nationalist Army in 1950. His military career was over.\n\nHuang went to the United States to study Chinese History. At the University of Michigan, he received his Bachelor's degree in 1954, his Masters Degree in 1957 and his Doctorate in 1964. He was appointed Visiting Associate Professor at Columbia University in 1967, and a Professor at the State University of New York, New Paltz Branch in 1968-1980. He was a research fellow at the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at Harvard in 1970. He worked with the leading American Sinologist John K. Fairbank. Nevertheless, Huang and Fairbank disagreed in research methodology. Fairbank liked concentrated analysis in short time frames and limited areas, while Huang liked synthesis covering broad time periods (though Huang's classic work \"1587, a Year of No Significance\" had a very tight focus).\n\nIn 1972, Huang went to Cambridge University and assisted Joseph Needham, who was more sympathetic to Huang's research approach, in Needham's monumental work on the history of Chinese science and technology. Huang's chosen field of study became financial administration in Ming China, and he published one of his major works, \"Taxation and Finance in Sixteenth Century Ming China\", in 1974 (translated into Chinese only in 2001).\n\nHe returned to Cambridge in the mid 1970s, and contributed two chapters to the Ming Dynasty Volumes of \"The Cambridge History of China\". Around the late 1970s, he retired from teaching and focused on writing instead, even occasionally contributing to a column in \"Yazhou Zhoukan\". Nonetheless, he often travelled to Taiwan even after retirement to give lectures and participate in various academic exchanges.\n\nHis other works include \"The War in Northern Burma\" (1946), \"1587, a Year of No Significance\" (1981) (also published in Chinese as \"The Fifteenth Year of Wan Li\"/, 1985), \"Broadening the Chinese Field of Vision\" (in Chinese, 1988), \"Chinese Macrohistory\" (1988) (in Chinese 1993), \"Conversations about Chinese History on the Banks of the Hudson River\" (in Chinese 1989), \"Discussions of Here and There and Old and New\" (in Chinese 1991), \"Capitalism and the Twenty First Century\" (in Chinese 1991), \"From a Macrohistory Perspective in Reading Jiang Jieshi's Diary\" (in Chinese 1993), \"Contemporary Chinese Outlets\" (in Chinese 1994), \"The Affair of Wan Chong\" (in Chinese 1998), \"Yellow River Blue Mountain: Record of Huang Renzi's Recollections\" (in Chinese 2001), and \"Bianjing Unfinished Dreams\".\n\nHe married Gayle Bates (1937-2000) in 1966 and the two had a son, Jefferson, a longtime administrator at Claremont McKenna College, as well as two other sons from his wife's previous marriage. He died of a heart attack in 2000.\n\n"}

At this time he lived at Foresters Wynd off the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.\n\nHe translated several scientific works into English, such as Antoine Lavoisier's work of 1789, \"Traité Élémentaire de Chimie\", published under the title \"Elements of Chemistry in a New Systematic Order containing All the Modern Discoveries\", in 1790. In 1792, he published \"The Animal Kingdom\", the first two volumes of a four-tome translation of Linnaeus' \"Systema Naturae\", which is often cited as the taxonomic authority for a great many species. (He never translated the remaining two volumes.)\n\nIn 1794 he left his post as a surgeon to manage a paper mill at Ayton in Berwickshire which he had purchased. He lost much of his fortune with this enterprise. Out of economical necessity he began writing again in 1809, publishing a variety of minor works, for instance a \"General View of the Agriculture of Berwickshire\". His last work was a translation of Cuvier's \"Recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupedes\", which was published after Kerr's death under the title \"Essays on the Theory of the Earth\".\n\nHis other works included a massive historical study entitled \"A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels\" in eighteen volumes. Kerr began the series in 1811, dedicating it to Sir Alexander Cochrane, K.B., Vice-Admiral of the White. Publication did not cease following Kerr's death in 1813; the latter volumes were published into the 1820s.\n\nHe died at home, Hope Park House, east of the Meadows in Edinburgh, where he had lived since 1810, and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in central Edinburgh against the eastern wall. His stone is added to a much earlier (1610) ornate stone monument. His son, David Wardrobe Kerr (1796-1815) lies with him.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a student of Konstantin Bestuzhev-Ryumin, who recommended that he be given the opportunity to \"prepare to be a professor.\" \n\nPlatonov belonged to the \"St. Petersburg school\" of Russian historiography, which paid special attention to the study and publication of historical sources. Platonov gained his master's thesis in 1888 writing about Old Russian Legends and Tales About the Seventeenth-Century Time of Troubles as a Historical Source for which he gained the Uvarov Award of the Academy of Sciences.\n\nPlatonov's scholarly career was centered on the University of St Petersburg, where he was held in highest repute for his detailed studies of the \"Time of Troubles\" (1923) and Oprichnina. Platonov's history textbooks, impeccably written and easily readable, enjoyed such popularity that he was asked by the tsar to teach history to his children. In 1909, he was admitted to the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nUnlike some of his disciples (such as Alexander Presnyakov), Platonov did not change his views after the Revolution and stood aloof from the mainstream Marxist historiography, as represented by Mikhail Pokrovsky. Nevertheless, he was permitted to administer the Archaeographic Commission in 1918-29, the Pushkin House (i.e., the Russian Literature Institute) in 1925–1929 and the Academy's Library in 1925–1928. \n\nOn 12 January 1930 Platonov was accused of taking part in a royalist conspiracy, arrested and exiled to Samara, where he died three years later. Most of his books were republished after the downfall of the Soviet regime.\n\n\n"}

While a number of countries have built satellites, as of 2018, eleven countries have had the capability to send objects into orbit using their own launch vehicles. Russia and Ukraine inherited the space launchers and satellites capability from the Soviet Union, following its dissolution in 1991. Russia launches its rockets from its own and foreign (Kazakh) spaceports. Ukraine launched only from foreign (Russian and Kazakh) launch facilities until 2015, after which political differences with Russia effectively halted Ukraine's ability to produce orbital rockets. France became a space power independently, launching a payload into orbit from Algeria, before joining space launcher facilities in the multi-national Ariane project. The United Kingdom became a space power independently following a single payload insertion into orbit from Australia, before discontinuing official participation in space launch capability, including the Ariane project, in the 1970s.\n\nThus, , nine countries and one inter-governmental organisation (ESA) currently have a proven orbital launch capability, and two countries (France, UK) formerly had such an independent capability. In all cases where a country has conducted independent human spaceflights (as of 2017, three - Russia, USA, and China), these launches were preceded by independent unmanned launch capability.\n\nThe race to launch the first satellite was closely contested by the Soviet Union and the United States, and was the beginning of the Space Race. The launching of satellites, while still contributing to national prestige, is a significant economic activity as well, with public and private rocket systems competing for launches, using cost and reliability as selling points. \nThe above list includes confirmed satellite launches with rockets produced by the launching country. Lists with differing criteria might include the following launches:\n\n\nSome countries have no self-developed rocket systems, but have provided their spaceports for launches of their own and foreign satellites on foreign launchers:\n\n\n\n\nMany other countries have launched their own satellites on one of the foreign launchers listed above (the first being the British owned and operated, although American-built satellite Ariel 1, was launched by a US rocket in April 1962.

It was primarily operated by the U.S. Air Force. The primary unit at the base was the 376th Air Expeditionary Wing. On 3 June 2014 American troops vacated the base and it was handed over back to the Kyrgyzstan military.\n\nThe base was opened in December 2001 to support U.S. military operations in the ongoing war in Afghanistan. It had hosted forces from several other International Security Assistance Force member states as well. The base was a transit point for U.S. military personnel coming and going from Afghanistan. The base had good recreation facilities for airmen, soldiers, sailors, and Marines (internet cafes, wireless internet, pool tables, free video games, telephones to DSN lines that allow a coalition forces to call their homes at little or no cost). The base had a large dining facility, gymnasium, and a chapel. There was also a library where books and magazines were available for active duty airmen.\n\nSeveral events, such as the shooting of a local civilian and rumors of fuel dumping, had led to strained relations with some of the local population. Powers such as Russia and China had been pushing for the closure of the base since 2005.\n\nIn February 2009, the Kyrgyz Parliament voted to close the base after the two governments failed to agree on a higher rent for the property. American and Kyrgyz officials continued negotiations after the announcement, and on 23 June a tentative agreement was reached. Under the new arrangement, the United States will pay $200 million, three times the previous rent, for continued use of the facilities. Before the handover to the Kyrgyz military, Kyrgyz forces handled security in the areas surrounding the facility, while American forces provided security for the facility, and the site was then called a \"transit center\" instead of an \"air base\".\n\nAll U.S. forces vacated the base in early June 2014, at which time control of the base was handed over to Kyrgyz authorities. The U.S. lease officially expired in July 2014.\n\nThe installation was initially named after New York Fire Department Chief Peter J. Ganci, Jr., who was killed in the 11 September terrorist attack. The all-ranks club/recreation center on base was known as \"Pete's Place\" in his honor.\n\nShortly after the U.S. Air Force had used the name \"Ganci\", it was found that an Air Force Instruction (AFI) dictated that non-U.S. air bases could not bear the name of any U.S. citizens (the former Clark Air Base in the Philippines pre-dated this instruction). Since that time the air base has been officially called Manas Air Base, after the name of Manas International Airport where it is located.\n\nThe name \"Manas\" refers to the Epic of Manas, a world-renowned Kyrgyz epic poem.\n\nThe facility was renamed \"Transit Center at Manas\" following a new agreement between the U.S. and Kyrgyz governments, signed in June 2009. Most English-language sources, however, continue to refer to it as \"Manas Air Base\".\n\nThe Transit Center at Manas International Airport is a transportation and logistics hub established to support international efforts to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan.\n\nThe Center opened on 16 December 2001. Since then it has hosted forces from Australia, Denmark, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and the United States.\n\nAn agreement between the U.S. Government and the Government of Kyrgyzstan permitting use of Manas International Airport as a Transit Center was concluded in May 2009, entered into force on 14 July 2009, and was ratified by the Parliament of Kyrgyzstan on 25 June 2009. It dictates that the United States and Kyrgyzstan must consult on all matters pertaining to the Mansas Transit Center, including environmental protection, health and human safety, and local procurement. The United States assists Kyrgyzstan with the upkeep and maintenance of the airport. Given the importance of the Transit Center for ongoing international military operations in Afghanistan, the United States has agreed to provide $60 million per year in quarterly installments for use of the airport and facilities for the Transit Center and as reimbursement for mutually agreed logistics support. All payments are made directly to the Government of Kyrgyzstan.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Bishkek and the U.S. military continue to work closely with the Government of Kyrgyzstan to ensure that operations at the Transit Center are consistent with the terms of the Agreement. U.S. military personnel at the Transit Center are mindful of the needs of the local community and contribute to humanitarian efforts in Kyrgyzstan. U.S. airmen from the Transit Center recently visited an orphanage at Krasnorechenskaya Boarding School to deliver food and clothing. They also donated flour, oil, rice, and pasta for the 270 children at the Sokulukskaya Special Boarding School and orphanage.\n\nOn 18 December 2001, the 86th Contingency Response Group out of Ramstein Air Base in Germany arrived at Manas to open the airfield for military use as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nU.S. close air support aircraft deployed there included U.S. Air Force F-15Es and U.S. Marine Corps F-18s. In February 2002, a detachment of French Air Force Dassault Mirage 2000D ground attack aircraft and KC-135 air-refueling tankers deployed to Manas in support of ground forces in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. In March of the same year, the Royal Australian Air Force stationed two B707 air-to-air refueling aircraft at the base. It was also deployed an C-130 Norwegian in early 2002 which were withdrawn in October 2002 when a tri-national detachment, known as European Participating Airforces (EPAF) of a total of 18 F-16s, 6 from the Danish, 6 from the Dutch and 6 from the Norwegian F-16 multirole aircraft took the place of the Mirages. Support for the new aircraft came in the form of one Netherlands KDC-10 tanker, and several American KC-135s, which remain assigned to this day. At the same time it was deployed two Spanish Superpuma rescue helicopter from the Army Aviation and at least 2 Spanish C-130s. Several of the servicemen from this unit were killed in an air crash on their way home from the base. The unofficial nickname to this base is \"The Gateway to Hell\", as many that pass through the base are on their way to combat. That said, it was also appreciated by the Marines coming out of Helmand.\n\nIn September 2004, the Royal Netherlands Air Force again returned with 5x F-16 fighter/bomber to provide Close Air Support (CAS) for the ISAF mission, which now encompassed both Kabul and Northern Afghanistan. To supplement the small availability of tanker aircraft, a RNLAF KDC-10 was also deployed which flew regularly to supply Dutch F-16s with fuel. At that time, the Spanish Airforce was also giving support with a single C-130. The Dutch, commanded by LtCol Bob \"Body\" Verkroost, remained until the presidential elections of 9 October 2004 elected Hamid Karzai as president of Afghanistan. The last F-16 mission was flown on 19 November 2004 at which time the F-16s were withdrawn to their homebase of Volkel Airbase in the Netherlands, while the KDC-10 flew the personnel back to Eindhoven Airport. The Dutch returned with F-16s to the Afghan theatre in 2005 but at that time began operating out of Kabul Airport.\n\nThe Tulip Revolution of March 2005 led to the toppling of Kyrgyz president Askar Akayev. However, American and allied personnel did not find themselves disrupted or affected, according to international news reports. One military member even indicated, \"It's been business as usual...We did not miss a single flight.\"\n\nIn April 2006, Kyrgyzstan's new president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, threatened to expel U.S. troops if the United States would not agree by 1 June to pay more for stationing forces in the Central Asian nation. He later withdrew this threat.\n\nOn 6 September 2006, U.S. Air Force officer Maj. Jill Metzger went missing after being separated from her group while visiting a shopping center in Bishkek. She was found three days later in the nearby city of Kant. Metzger claimed to have escaped from kidnappers, though U.S. officials noted \"serious inconsistencies\" in her account. The Air Force confirmed in February 2012 that Metzger had indeed been kidnapped as she had claimed.\n\nOn 6 December 2006, U.S. serviceman Zachary Hatfield fatally shot Alexander Ivanov, a Kyrgyz civilian, at a truck checkpoint at the base. A statement from the base stated the airman \"used deadly force in response to a threat at an entry control checkpoint\". Ivanov, a truck driver for Aerocraft Petrol Management, was waiting to finish the security check before proceeding into the U.S.-controlled area. According to a base spokesman, \"As the airman approached the tent, the driver physically threatened him with a knife which was discovered at the scene. The airman drew his 9mm weapon and fired in self-defense.\" Hatfield fired two shots into Ivanov's chest, killing him.\n\nThe killing drew widespread condemnation from Kyrgyz authorities and they quickly demanded that Hatfield's immunity from local prosecution be revoked. In the meantime, U.S. authorities agreed to have Hatfield remain in Kyrgyzstan until the matter is resolved.\nAnother issue to come out of the shooting was that of the compensation offered to Ivanov's family. His employer offered the family $50,000 while the U.S. government offered only around $2,000. Galina Skripkina, a lawyer representing Ivanov's widow, described the U.S. offer as \"humiliating\" and said that if it was not increased the family would take legal action. However, the U.S. embassy stated that this amount was an interim payment and that final compensation would be determined once the investigation into the shooting was concluded.\n\nWhile making statements of regret about the incident, the airman was quickly transported back to the United States. More detailed data about the hearings on the Hatfield case were published in late December 2010 via the web site Russian Reporter, which issued a series of dispatches from the State Department and U.S. embassies, supposedly originating from the WikiLeaks archive. In one of them, dated July 2009, the State Department provided a briefing to the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek regarding the case of Hatfield. It recommended communication with the Kyrgyz authorities in respect of the incident. Hatfield was subject to \"administrative measures\", details of which are not disclosed in the dispatch. \"Junior Sergeant Hatfield was subject to severe administrative measures against him, which will have long-term effects and negatively affect his career,\" the dispatch promised. But criminal charges against Hatfield never went to a military court. According to the dispatch, the officer authorized to initiate court-martial was General Arthur Lichte, a commander at the airbase, who, \"after reviewing the report of the Article 32 investigation and considering the advice of his staff judge advocate...dismissed the charge against SrA Hatfield,\" the dispatch states. It said that Lichte had ruled for a non-prosecution based \"on his own professional and impartial judgment of the facts of the case and the evidence that was available.\" The reasons for Lichte’s decision were not explained in the dispatch. \"Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, a convening authority generally does not explain his or her rationale for a referral decision, so as to preserve the impartiality and independence of the military justice system\", explained the dispatch. The paper reports that General Lichte was given the power of referral because he was not previously involved in the investigation of the case, nor in the chain of command relating to SrA Hatfield.\n\nOn 3 February 2009, Kyrgyzstan's President Kurmanbek Bakiyev announced that Manas Air Base would soon be closed. Bakiyev said that economic considerations and the negative public attitude towards the base contributed to the decision. A bill calling for the closure of the base and the eviction of U.S. forces was passed by the Kyrgyz parliament by a vote of 78 to one on 19 February 2009. The following day, 20 February, an official eviction notice was delivered to the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek, according to the Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe news of the base's closure followed the announcement of a new agreement between Russia and Kyrgyzstan in which Kyrgyzstan will receive $2 billion in loans and $150 million in financial aid from Russia. Most observers see the two events as connected, and believe that Russian financial assistance was offered on the condition that U.S. forces were expelled from Kyrgyzstan. As of 2009, the U.S. government provided $150 million in aid annually to Kyrgyzstan. According to General David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, around $63 million of that sum is directly connected to the base. The larger Russian package is viewed by some analysts as an effort to \"out-bid\" the Americans.\n\nReferring to the closure of Manas Air Base, Pentagon spokesman Geoff S. Morrell directly accused Russia of \"attempting to undermine [American] use of that facility\". U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates also said that, \"The Russians are trying to have it both ways with respect to Afghanistan in terms of Manas. On one hand you're making positive noises about working with us in Afghanistan, and on the other hand you're working against us in terms of that airfield which is clearly important to us.\" However Russian President Dmitry Medvedev distanced his country from the announcement, saying that it was \"within the competence of the Kyrgyz Republic\" to decide how the Manas base functioned.\n\nOn 23 June 2009 a new deal was reached between the U.S. and Kyrgyz governments. It was ratified by the Kyrgyz parliament two days later, and signed into law by President Bakiyev on 7 July. Under the terms of the new agreement, U.S. payment for use of the facilities will increase from $17.1 million to $60 million. An additional $117 million will be given to the Kyrgyz government, including $36 million for upgrading the airport with additional storage facilities and aircraft parking, $21 million for fighting drug trafficking in the country, and $20 million for economic development.\n\nThe facility's official title also was altered under the new agreement. Instead of being referred to as \"Manas Air Base\", it became the \"Transit Center at Manas International Airport\". According to a Kyrgyz government spokesman, the facility will officially cease to be an air base in August 2009, after which point its legal status would be altered to a logistic center. Additionally, security around the base will now be handled by Kyrgyz personnel, as opposed to American servicemen.\n\nSeveral local political observers believe that despite the changes in the new agreement, activities at the base will continue unaltered, and in fact, as of March 2010, operations continue. In March 2010 the United States transported 50,000 NATO soldiers to Afghanistan via Kyrgyzstan as it represents the quickest and most efficient route. The new agreement does not appear to restrict the kind of materials U.S. forces can move into and out of the base. There have, however, been some concerns as to whether Russia and China will lobby the Kyrgyz government not to renew the lease when the current agreement comes to an end in June 2010.\n\nAccording to Bill Gertz, US State Department officials reportedly overheard that China had asked the government of Kyrgyzstan to close the base to U.S. use in return for $3 billion in cash (a sum equal to a tenth of all Chinese foreign aid given from 1950-2009). According to Gertz, the Chinese ambassador to Kyrgyzstan subsequently denied to the U.S. ambassador that the covert cash offer had been made.\n\nOn 6 April 2010 a second revolution took place. The transit center itself saw few mishaps during the revolution. The 376th Expeditionary Security Forces and augmentees were initially called to combat duty when a Kyrgyz military armored personnel carrier (APC) was taken from a National Guard facility in Bishkek by revolutionaries was driven to the transit center with the intent to enter the base and stop any fleeing members of the former government. Small arms fire erupted in several locations around the base to include the flight line. The base commander Colonel Holt had all armed combat units and those that were transiting to or from Afghanistan in combat posture to defend the transit center.\n\nOn 8 November 2011, newly elected President Almazbek Atambayev announced that he would attempt to close the base when its lease runs out in 2014.\n\nIn September 2012, Atambayev repeated his view that \"Manas should be a civil airport\" which \"should not be a military base for any country\". He reaffirmed his stance that starting from 2014, Manas airport will only be used to transport passengers.\n\nIn 2014, American military flights began to fly out of Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport, Romania instead of Manas.\n\n\n\n"}

The tradition has been far rarer historically than primogeniture (sole inheritance by the first-born) or partible inheritance (division of the estate among the children).\n\nUltimogeniture might be considered appropriate in circumstances where the youngest child had been assigned the role of \"keeping the hearth\", taking care of the parents and continuing at home, whereas elder children had had time and opportunity to succeed in the world and provide for themselves. In a variation on the system, elder children might have received a share of land and moveable property at a younger age, for example when marrying and founding their own family. Ultimogeniture might also be considered appropriate for the estates of elderly rulers and property-owners, whose children were likely to be mature adults.\n\nThere are several disadvantages for realms and families that adopt ultimogeniture. One such drawback is the fact that elder siblings, especially the first born of the relevant gender, will be heavily incentivized to sidestep the tradition, even more so if primogeniture inheritance is a familiar concept. And since the elder siblings likely have more time and opportunities to gain power, wealth, experience, and influence prior to the inheritance—simply because they were born earlier—ultimogeniture traditions are more likely to be disregarded or even discarded.\n\nCoercion, assassination, fratricide, or even patricide can be committed, backed by all the advantage an elder sibling would have, such that ultimogeniture is sidestepped.\nTo clarify, those who stand to gain by ignoring the stipulation under ultimogeniture are more likely to have the facility to do so, when compared to other succession laws. For example, under primogeniture tradition, the younger siblings will stand to gain if they can bypass said tradition, but the elder siblings still have the aforementioned advantages, so primogeniture traditions tend to persist.\n\n\n\n"}

Six countries abstained: Algeria, Brazil, China, Pakistan, the Philippines and Russia.\n\nThe resolution was sponsored by France and the United States.

Critics of the resolution argue however that an attempt from the weak and politically divided Lebanese army to disarm Hezbollah would be very difficult and could restart the Lebanese civil war. Syria was also in violation of the resolution until recently because of their military presence in Lebanon.\n\nOn 7 October 2004 the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan reported to the Security Council regarding the lack of compliance with Resolution 1559. Mr. Annan concluded his report by saying: \"It is time, 14 years after the end of hostilities and four years after the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, for all parties concerned to set aside the remaining vestiges of the past. The withdrawal of foreign forces and the disbandment and disarmament of militias would, with finality, end that sad chapter of Lebanese history.\"\n\nThe 20 January 2005 UN Secretary-General's report on Lebanon stated that \"The continually asserted position of the Government of Lebanon that the Blue Line is not valid in the Shab'a farms area is not compatible with Security Council resolutions. The Council has recognized the Blue Line as valid for purposes of confirming Israel’s withdrawal pursuant to resolution 425 (1978). The UN Security Council has repeatedly requested that all parties respect the Blue Line in its entirety.\"\n\nOn 28 January 2005 Resolution 1583 called upon the Government of Lebanon to fully extend and exercise its sole and effective authority throughout the south, including through the deployment of sufficient numbers of Lebanese armed and security forces, to ensure a calm environment throughout the area, including along the Blue Line, and to exert control over the use of force on its territory and from it.\n\nSyria made few moves to comply with the resolution until the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, on 14 February 2005. International pressure to withdraw intensified and public perception in Lebanon turned strongly against Syria, evidenced by mass demonstrations that were labeled the Cedar Revolution. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria announced on 5 March 2005 that he planned to \"bring his forces home.\" The withdrawal, involving about 14,000 troops, took about seven weeks to complete.\n\nOn 26 April 2005, after 29 years of military action in Lebanon, the last Syrian troops left Lebanon. Syrian military and intelligence facilities, after the destruction of sensitive documents or the transportation of logistical material, were turned over to Lebanese counterparts. This action left the Lebanese government as the main violator of the resolution due to its refusal to dismantle the pro-Syrian Palestinian and Hezbollah militias.\n\nOn 27 December 2005 Katyusha rockets fired from Hezbollah territory smashed into houses in the Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona wounding three people . UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on the Lebanese government \"to extend its control over all its territory, to exert its monopoly on the use of force, and to put an end to all such attacks\" .\n\nOn 23 January 2006 the UN Security Council called on the Government of Lebanon to make more progress in controlling its territory and disbanding militias, while also calling on Syria to cooperate with those efforts. In a statement read out by its January President, Augustine Mahiga of Tanzania, the Council also called on Syria to take measures to stop movements of arms and personnel into Lebanon.\n\nThe Lebanese government officially responded to the resolution on the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) website in three ways: \n\nHezbollah and the Loyalty to the Resistance bloc denounced a report on the resolution in 2010 as meddling in Lebanese affairs.\n\nThe question of compliance with Resolution 1559 is a prominent matter in Lebanese politics. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora has stated that the government considers Hezbollah arms to be a domestic affair and that stated policy should reassure Hezbollah that the government will protect its military wing. Hezbollah, seeing itself as the sole representative of the Lebanese resistance, was trying to acquire better privileges allowing it to stop any possible attack. The debate took several months after which prime minister Fouad Siniora admitted that the resistance will be not called anything else but resistance, in reference to people attacking it as a militia.\n\nDruze leader MP Walid Jumblatt has repeatedly insisted that he objects to the disarmament of Hezbollah, according to the international resolution, describing the party as a \"resistance group\" and not a militia. He engaged in an electoral alliance with Hezbollah during the 2005 parliamentary election, with one of the titles of the alliance being \"The Protection of the Resistance,\" but is now calling on Hezbollah to be integrated into the Lebanese Army and hand in its weapons over to the government.\n\nSiniora has more stated on 20 July 2006 that \"the continued presence of Israeli occupation of Lebanese lands in the Shebaa Farms region is what contributes to the presence of Hezbollah weapons. The international community must help us in (getting) an Israeli withdrawal from Shebaa Farms so we can solve the problem of Hezbollah's arms.\"\n\n\n"}
