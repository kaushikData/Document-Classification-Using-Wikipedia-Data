Two of those killed were teenage girls.\n\nIt is believed that the former Loyalist Volunteer Force leader and at that time in 1991 UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade commander Billy Wright had planned and ordered the attack. Those killed were Eileen Duffy (19), Katrina Rennie (16) and Brian Frizzell (29).\n\nThe year 1991 during The Troubles saw a return to the tit-for-tat sectarian killings between Irish Republican and Ulster Loyalist paramilitaries that plagued Belfast, Armagh and other places in Northern Ireland during the mid 1970s which saw hundreds of both Catholic and Protestant civilians killed.\n\nJust three weeks earlier, in the 1991 Cappagh killings, the UVF carried out a gun attack on a pub in the staunchly Republican County Tyrone village of Cappagh, killing one civilian and three IRA members.\n\nThe two teenage girls who were killed were sitting behind the counter in the mobile shop along with a third teenage girl, Jamie Smith. There was several people in the shop at the time and the girls were talking among themselves. A van pulled up outside the shop and a masked gunman wearing military style clothing, armed with a 9mm Browning pistol, jumped out. One of the people in the shop presuming it was Republicans yelled \"Provisional IRA, hit the floor!\". Most people managed to escape, but the three girls were stuck and trapped behind the counter. The gunman pulled Jamie Smith by the hair calling her a \"Fenian slut\" and then threw her out of the shop. The UVF gunman then shot Duffy and Rennie, killing them both. While the attack was taking place, Brian Frizzell walked into the shop, and was shot as the gunman was leaving the store.\n\nEileen's brother Brendan Duffy was one of the first at the shop after the attack, he described the scene:\n\"Brian Frizzell was lying in a pool of blood. Katrina was still sitting on the crate. She was dead but her blue eyes were wide open and there was a bullet wound on her neck. Eileen was slumped on the floor, shot in the head. Her face was badly swollen and blood was pumping out of her head and ears. I tried to resuscitate her but in my heart I knew she was gone. I was so numb, I couldn't cry.\" \n\nThe killings drew widespread condemnation from both the Catholic and Protestant communities in Northern Ireland. The funerals were attended by thousands of people. \n\nIt's believed the killings of Protestant civilians Derek Patterson on the 9 April & Ian Sproule on the 12 April were in retaliation to the Drumbeg killings. \n\nEight months after the attack three more civilians were killed by the UVF in the Craigavon area at the Carbet Road-Carn Road junction. Desmond Rogers (54), Fergus Magee (28), and John Lavery (27) were shot dead, Rogers and Magee were Catholics, Lavery a Protestant. The three men were shot in their car after being stopped at an illegal UVF checkpoint (a similar tactic to that used by the UVF in the Miami Showband killings1975). The UVF later apologized for killing the Protestant man. In October 1992, a man, Vicky Ahitty (24), from Portadown, was charged with these and other murders and firearms possession.\n\nIn 1992, Tom Harper was charged with the Drumbeg mobile shop murders, although he was the driver and not the gunman. He was given a life sentence for his part in the murders. The attack was ordered by Billy Wright, but the gunman has never been charged. Local allegations of security force collusion remain and it was noted that, on the night of the shooting, the normally heavy police presence was not apparent. In September 2011, the PSNI announced that records of interviews with suspects in key murder investigations from 1985 to 1993 had been destroyed in 1998 as the place they were stored was contaminated with asbestos. They included the records in this case.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

He was born in Paparangi, Johnsonville, and lived in Tawa (originally called Tawa Flat). In 1932 Carman moved to Ranui in Tawa, with his new wife Edith Clark; they lived at No 7 Iti Street, Linden. Arthur had been in the Audit Department but, hankering for a bureaucracy free life, decided to become a Lambton Quay bookseller. They liked the countryside, although Ranui had barely formed metal roads and it was quicker for Edith to push the pram along the rail tracks to Tawa, picking up lumps of coal en route. Arthur caught the morning train to the shop. He started the agitation for a station at Linden to avoid having to pull the emergency cord to alight at Linden.\n\nHe was a bookseller and publisher (as Wright and Carman, founded by his father Walter Carman); his Lambton Quay bookshop was a landmark and meeting place for thirty years. \"Arthur Carman Street\" in Paparangi is named after him.\n\nHe was on several local bodies: the Wellington Hospital Board, the Tawa Borough Council and the Hutt Valley Power and Gas Board. He stood unsuccessfully as an independent for the Wellington City Council in 1941 and 1944, and also for Wellington North in the 1943 general election, his only avenue to debate pacifism legally in wartime New Zealand.\n\nHe published sports books as Arthur Carman (\"The New Zealand Rugby Almanack\", \"The New Zealand Cricket Almanack\"; both annuals) and local history books as A.

{"id": "13776844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13776844", "title": "Baby Scoop Era", "text": "Baby Scoop Era\n\nThe Baby Scoop Era was a period in anglosphere history starting after the end of World War II and ending in the early 1970s, characterized by an increased rate of pre-marital pregnancies over the preceding period, along with a higher rate of newborn adoption.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1973, it is estimated that up to 4 million parents in the United States had children placed for adoption, with 2 million during the 1960s alone. Annual numbers for non-relative adoptions increased from an estimated 33,800 in 1951 to a peak of 89,200 in 1970, then quickly declined to an estimated 47,700 in 1975. (This does not include the number of infants adopted and raised by relatives.) In contrast, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that only 14,000 infants were placed for adoption in 2003.\n\nThis period of history has been documented in scholarly books such as \"Wake Up Little Susie\" and \"Beggars and Choosers\", both by historian Rickie Solinger, and social histories such as the book \"The Girls Who Went Away\" and the documentary, \"A Girl Like Her\", based on the book by Ann Fessler. Fessler is a professor of photography at the Rhode Island School of Design who exhibited an art installation titled \"The Girls Who Went Away\". It is also the theme of the documentary \"Gone To A Good Home\" by Film Australia.\n\nBeginning in the 1940s and 1950s, illegitimacy began to be defined in terms of psychological deficits on the part of the mother. At the same time, a liberalization of sexual mores combined with restrictions on access to birth control led to an increase in premarital pregnancies. The dominant psychological and social work view was that the large majority of unmarried mothers were better off being separated by adoption from their newborn babies. According to Mandell (2007), \"In most cases, adoption was presented to the mothers as the only option and little or no effort was made to help the mothers keep and raise the children\".\n\nSolinger describes the social pressures that led to this unusual trend, explaining that women who had no control over their reproductive lives were defined by psychological theory as \"not-mothers\", and that because they had no control over their reproductive lives, they were subject to the ideology of those who watched over them. As such, for unmarried pregnant girls and women in the pre-\"Roe\" era, the main chance for attaining home and marriage rested on their acknowledging their alleged shame and guilt, and this required relinquishing their children, with more than 80% of unwed mothers in maternity homes acting in essence as \"breeders\" for adoptive parents. According to Ellison, from 1960 to 1970, 27 percent of all births to married women between the ages of 15 and 29 were conceived premaritally. This problem was thought to be caused by female neurosis, and those who could not procure an abortion, legally or otherwise, were encouraged to put up their children for adoption.\n\nIn popular usage, singer Celeste Billhartz uses the term \"baby scoop era\" on her website to refer to the era covered by her work \"The Mothers Project.\" A letter on Senator Bill Finch's website uses the term as well. Writer Betty Mandell references the term in her article \"Adoption\". The term was also used in a 2004 edition of the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\".\n\nInfant adoptions began declining in the early 1970s, a decline often attributed to the decreasing birth rate, but which also partially resulted from social and legal changes that enabled middle-class mothers to have an alternative single motherhood.\n\nThe decline in the fertility rate is associated with the introduction of the pill in 1960, the completion of legalization of artificial birth control methods, the introduction of federal funding to make family planning services more available to the young and low income, and the legalization of abortion.\n\nBrozinsky (1994) speaks of the decline in newborn adoptions as reflecting a freedom of choice embraced by youth and the women's movement of the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in an increase in the number of unmarried mothers who parented their babies as opposed to having them taken for adoption purposes. \"In 1970, approximately 80% of the infants born to single mothers were [...] [taken for adoption purposes], whereas by 1983 that figure had dropped to only 4%.\" \n\nIn contrast to numbers in the 1960s and 1970s, from 1989 to 1995 fewer than 1% of children born to never-married women were surrendered for adoption.\n\nA similar social development took place in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.\n\nCanada's \"Baby Scoop Era\" refers to the postwar period from 1945 to 1988, when over 400,000 unmarried pregnant persons, mostly aged 15–19 (usually Caucasian), were targeted for their yet-to-be-born infants, simply because they were unmarried with a child. A large number of these young women were confined as inmates in maternity group homes, which were managed by religious orders, such as the Salvation Army, the Catholic Church, the United Church and the Anglican Church etc. These maternity \"homes\" were heavily funded by the Canadian government. There were over 70 maternity homes in Canada which housed between 20 and 200 pregnant women at a time. In Canadian maternity \"homes\" and hospitals, up to 100% of newborns were removed from their legal mothers after birth and given up for adoption purposes. These newborns were taken under a Health and Welfare protocol.\n\nSome professionals of the era considered that the punishment of the mother for her transgression was an important part of the process. Dr. Marion Hilliard of Women's College Hospital was quoted in 1956 saying: The father plays absolutely no part in this. That is part of her rehabilitation. When she renounces her child for its own good, the unwed mother has learned a lot. She has learned an important human value. She has learned to pay the price of her misdemeanor, and this alone, if punishment is needed, is punishment enough...We must go back to a primary set of values and the discipline that starts with the very small child.The term Baby Scoop Era is similar to the term Sixties Scoop, which was coined by Patrick Johnston, author of \"Native Children and the Child Welfare System\". \"Sixties Scoop\" refers to the Canadian practice, beginning in the 1960s and continuing until the late 1980s, of apprehending unusually high numbers of Native children over the age of 5 years old from their families and fostering or adopting them out. A similar event happened in Australia where Aboriginal children, sometimes referred to as the Stolen Generation, were removed from their families and placed into internment camps, orphanages and other institutions.\n\nA similar period of forced adoption, also known as the \"White Stolen Generations\", also occurred in Australia. It is generally understood that a decline of adoption during the 1970s was linked to a 1973 law providing for financial assistance to single parents.\n\n"}
{"id": "22904550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22904550", "title": "Bell Memorial", "text": "Bell Memorial\n\nThe Bell Memorial, also known as the Bell Monument and Telephone Monument, is a memorial designed by Walter Seymour Allward to commemorate the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell at the Bell Homestead National Historic Site, in Brantford, Ontario, Canada.\n\nIn 1906, the citizens of the Brantford and Brant County areas formed the Bell Telephone Memorial Association, which commissioned the memorial. By 1908, the association's designs committee asked sculptors on two continents to submit proposals for the memorial. The submission by Canadian sculptor Walter Seymour Allward of Toronto won the competition. The memorial was originally scheduled for completion by 1912 but Allward, aided by his studio assistant Emanuel Hahn did not finish it until five years later. The Governor General of Canada, Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire, unveiled the memorial on 24 October 1917.\n\nAllward designed the monument to symbolize the telephone's ability to overcome great distances. A series of steps lead to the main section where the floating allegorical figure of \"Inspiration\" appears over a reclining male figure representing \"Man, transmitting sound through space\", discovering his power to transmit sound through space, and also pointing to three floating figures, the messengers of \"Knowledge\", \"Joy\", and \"Sorrow\" positioned at the other end of the tableau. Additionally, there are two female figures mounted on granite pedestals representing \"Humanity\" positioned to the left and right of the memorial, one sending and the other receiving a message.\n\nThe Bell Memorial has been described as the finest example of Allward's early work. The memorial itself has been used as a central fixture for many civic events and remains an important part of Brantford's history. It was provided a heritage designation under the \"Ontario Heritage Act\" in 2005 and listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places in 2009.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell conceived the technical aspects of the telephone and invented it in July 1874, while residing with his parents at their farm, Melville House, now a National Historic Site of Canada. One of the first successful voice transmissions of any notable distance was made on 4 August 1876, between the telegraph office in Brantford, Ontario and Bell's father's homestead over makeshift wires. He later refined the telephone's design at Brantford after producing his first working prototype in Boston. Canada's first telephone factory, created by James Cowherd, was located in Brantford, and operated from about 1879 to 1881 leading to the informal designation as \"The Telephone City\".\n\nDiscussion of a monument to commemorate both Bell and his invention was first raised in Brantford in 1904 although the Bell Telephone Memorial Association was not formally established until 1906. After gaining Bell's approval, the association and its proposed memorial were publicly endorsed on 9 March 1906 at a banquet in Brantford Kirby House (later to become the Hotel Kirby), which Bell attended as a guest of honour. That same year the association was formally organized and incorporated by an Act of the Legislature of Ontario with the stated aim of commemorating the invention of the telephone in Brantford and to name Bell as its inventor. What was highly unusual in this instance was the building of an important monument to a living person, an event usually conducted only for imperial leaders. The duality of the monument with its dedication to both the inventor and to his invention, with its emphasis on the latter, likely persuaded Alexander Graham Bell, normally modest, to accept the invitation to its public unveiling.\n\nThe association was organized with the support of George, Prince of Wales (later King George V), Viceroy of India and former Governor-General of Canada Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto, and the latter's successor Governor-General Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, plus an approximate dozen other prominent leaders in Canada and the United States, who endorsed the project with their backing. Donald Howard, 3rd Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal became its first honorary president and upon his death, he was succeeded by the Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, a former Governor-General of Canada. William Foster Cockshutt, the local federal Member of Parliament who had originally proposed the memorial in 1904, became the association's president, and was assisted by another MP, Lloyd Harris, who served as vice-president. The design selection committee was led by Byron Edmund Walker, a prominent Canadian banker, philanthropist and patron of the arts.\n\nThe Association's public appeal quickly raised within its first months, rising to $44,000 by September 1909, eventually collecting over $65,000 through donations from various citizens worldwide. An additional federal contribution of $10,000 was supported in Canada's parliament by Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier. In a city with a population of only 30,000, the fundraising needed for the monument was a major accomplishment.\n\nInvitations were sent out to 22 sculptors in Europe, the United States and Canada in 1908, inviting them to submit models for the proposed monument. By May 1909 either nine or ten models had been submitted. A designs committee was appointed by the association and selected the three best designs they favored from the models submitted. The committee asked a trio of outside judges, Sir Byron Edmund Walker of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto, New York State Senator George Allen Davis of Buffalo and Sir George Christie Gibbons of London, Ontario to make a final decision, all of whom were considered patrons of the arts. After consideration a unanimous choice was made to award the commission to Walter Seymour Allward. The millionaire banker and philanthropist Sir Byron Walker was likely persuasive in swaying the unanimous decision to the sculptor. Walker had earlier contacted a prominent Brantford banker, praising Allward's previous works, and advised him that \"because of the national character of the work I am particularly interested in the best possible outcome artistically\".\n\nThe commission award for the memorial had been made in 1908 and a contract to Allward authorized in 1909, based on an initial cost estimate of $25,000 with the provision that the work would be completed by 1912. Also in 1909 the association purchased Alexander Melville Bell's former homestead and farm, Melvile House, and transferred its ownership to the City of Brantford for conversion into a museum.\n\nAllward was assisted by his studio assistant, Emanuel Otto Hahn, another highly notable sculptor who worked on the monument with him until 1912 when Hahn left for the Ontario College of Art. The project proceeded slowly in part due to Allward's concurrent work on several other commissions at the same time, including the South African War Memorial, a major monument erected in Toronto. In April 1915 Allward reported to the committee that the two heroic figures to be mounted on pedestals had been successfully cast and that foundation work for the site had been tendered. But in regards to the central bronze casting, which was to become the largest ever created in North America up to that point, he could not estimate when it would be complete, writing in a letter \"I am giving all my time to it; I cannot do more. It is an important panel and cannot be too well done\". For various reasons the memorial was not completed until 1917, with World War I, material shortages, an embargo on exports of French moulding sand and transportation limitations creating lengthy delays.\n\nThe Brantford monument was finally unveiled in a driving rain on 24 October 1917 by then Governor General of Canada Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire before an audience in the thousands. The Governor General of Canada arrived in the city by train, along with the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario Sir John Hendrie, the Hon. Senator Robertson of the Privy Council, the Hon. W.D. McPherson of the Ontario Government and other notables. They were greeted by a children's chorus, honour guards, the band of the 125th (Brantford) Battalion and the chimes of Grace Anglican Church located only a few dozen metres from the memorial. Also in attendance in full war regalia was Chief A.R. Hill of the Six Nations Tribes of the Grand River, where Bell, not long after his arrival in Canada, had been made an honorary tribal chief.\n\nAs a public holiday had been declared for the unveiling, the city's normal activities were shut down for the entire day. After the Governor-General completed his address at the monument and unveiled its shrouds, he withdrew to the city's Old Opera House due to the driving rain, along with large numbers of the crowd. The ceremonies were continued indoors in the city's opera theatre, with Bell addressing the audience again twice more at both the opera house and during a formal reception meal held at the Kerby House. Others spoke with Bell, including his former associate from the Aerial Experiment Association, J.A.D. McCurdy, Gilbert Grosvenour, president of the National Geographic Society, and other dignitaries.\n\nAlexander Graham Bell (in both of his addresses that day) reminded the attendees that \"Brantford is right in claiming the invention of the telephone here... [which was] conceived in Brantford in 1874 and born in Boston in 1875\", and later addressing the Duke, said \"...on behalf of the Association ...in presenting to His Excellency [with] a silver telephone... I hope that in using it he will remember that the telephone originated in Brantford and that the first transmission to a distance was made between Brantford and Paris.\" In appreciation to the people of Brantford, Bell's wife, Mabel Hubbard Bell, made a contribution of $500 to the city's support fund for its soldiers then fighting in Europe.\n\nAt the time of its unveiling, the memorial was one of the most impressive monuments of the day in Canada, designed to depict the vast distances on the Earth being \"annihilated\" by the telephone. The allegorical style of the monument's figures depicts several aspects of the telephone in its worldwide use. Its most striking feature is its broad, main bronze cast panel, approximately seven and a half metres wide and two and a half metres high, which portray \"...the elusive dream of the inventor's youth—Inspiration whispering to Man, his power to transmit sound through space. Three ephemeral ghostly figures, two of which are cast in mid-relief and one in high (\"alto-rilievo\") relief, depict \"Knowledge, Joy\" and \"Sorrow\", transmitted to man by the telephone. Two heroic figures flanking the broad flight of steps leading up to the monument symbolize humanity sending and receiving a message.\"\n\nThe Memorial is located within the Bell Memorial Gardens of Bell Memorial Park at 41 West Street in the City of Brantford. The monument itself is located on a gore of land forming a near-triangularly shaped public park. The triangular plot of land in front of the monument was transformed into a park, with its embankments being sodded. The panel in front of the gore which contains the monument is a smaller gore which has been artistically laid out as a park, the entire area being named as the Bell Memorial Gardens.\n\nThe model for\" 'Man, discovering his power to transmit sound through space',\" was Cyril William George Kinsella a wounded war veteran and a former resident of Brantford. Kinsella served as Allward's nude model representing Man after being severely injured in the European conflict. Born in the UK he had become one of approximately 100,000 disadvantaged British children and orphans, a \"Home Child\", sent to Canada and other Commonwealth countries to find better lives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After arriving in Ontario in 1908 he resided in a series of Fegan Homes (named after James William Condell Fegan of Britain), including one in Toronto where he likely later met Allward. Kinsella eventually settled in Brantford County to perform farmwork. Underaged, but a healthy in height in 1914, he enlisted in Brantford's 125th Battalion for service overseas where he fought in Belgium and France with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I.\n\nKinsella was wounded and shell-shocked at the Second Battle of Ypres in Belgium and, after being invalided and discharged back to Canada in 1916, met Allward in Toronto while convalescing and then worked as his model, saying later \"The posing was exacting and took about two months.\" Kinsella subsequently became bored with civilian life and reenlisted with the Canadian Army, returning to Europe. He was serving with the 1st Canadian Division, Fourth Battalion near the northern French village of St. Marie Chappell at the time of the memorial's unveiling in Brantford. He later returned to Canada at the end of the war, but did not view himself on the memorial until 27 years later, in May 1946.\n\nAt the memorial's crest is a series of steps leading to the main portion of the monument, a wide mass of white Stanstead granite, faced by the largest single bronze casting created up to that time, which taxed the capacity of its foundry. The sculptor sought to bring out, as the dominant note, the discovery by man of his power to transmit sound through space. Above the reclining figure of man is \"Inspiration\", urging him on to greater endeavors, while, at the other end of the panel are the messengers of \"Knowledge\", \"Joy\" and \"Sorrow\", communicating to man by telephone. On both sides of the main portion of the monument are two \"heroic\" female figures representing humanity in bronze on granite mounts, one depicted in the act of sending, the other of receiving a message over the telephone. The two female figures were positioned some distance apart in order to denote the telephone's power to traverse great distances. Uniting the entire work together is the line of the earth's curvature on the bronze casting, depicting the extent of the telephone's worldwide use. Allward's original proposed design for the monument also included the flags of the greatest nations of the world, a modern element that was likely omitted as it would detract from the monument's neoclassical design.\n\nThe rear side of the monument contains a small stone foundation with bullfrog gargoyles; while cut in the stone, on pilasters, are representations of the British Crown and the Maple Leaf. On the rear, also, was placed a bronze plaque giving the names of the patrons and the executive committee of the Association. In the present day the plaque is now found on the side of the rightmost granite mount for one of the heroic figures. The foundation, steps, pedestals and walls are composed of durable Stanstead granite. On the main portion, to the right and left, two circular panels are inscribed: \"\"Hoc Opus Machinae Patri Dedicatum Est\" (this monument has been dedicated to the author of the invention) and \"Mundus Telephonici Usu Recreatus Est.\"\" (the world has been recreated using the telephone). Beneath the central bronze casting is a large carved inscription: \"To commemorate the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in Brantford 1874.\" Upon its public unveiling the Bell Memorial created a stir of controversy with its abstract allegorical interpretations. Upon first viewing the bronze tableau, one observer in the crowds remarked on the two main figures on its left side, \"Man the Inventor\" and \"Inspiration\". \"It looks to me...\" he spoke to his friend, \"...like an angel trying to pull along a pig-headed Englishman.\" The monument also launched its designer-sculptor to fame. It was designed and crafted under Walter Seymour Allward (1875–1955), likely Canada's best monumental sculptor of the era. Besides the Bell Memorial he created numerous other important monumental works, his greatest being the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in Pas-de-Calais, France, commemorating Canada's sacrifices and human losses in the First World War, a project he worked on 16 years until its completion in 1936. The Bell Memorial is located within the Bell Memorial Gardens, a small park in downtown Brantford, in an area originally slated to be the city's new municipal centre, but which was subsequently built further away. Other names considered for the park but which were not accepted included Bell Circle, Graham Bell Park and Prince George Park.\n\nAllward's memorial has been described as \"a tour de force\". One resident described the imagery of the oversized figures on its bronze panel, saying that it \"...depicts a mythical passing of the spark of communication from the hands of the gods to the hands of humans\". The memorial has served as an important gathering point, landmark and commemoration site for Brantford, used to rally people for fund-raising events, marches and civic events. At the Armistice of World War I, it became a spontaneous gathering point for celebration. It was also used to help raise funds for Brantford's First World War Cenotaph, another of Walter Allward's works.\n\nThe memorial received historical designation for its cultural heritage value, by the City of Brantford on 31 October 2005, under the \"Ontario Heritage Act\". It was also designated and listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places on 12 January 2009. In 2010 both Parks Canada and the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada celebrated Allward's work by affixing a plaque to the monument honouring the sculptor himself. It noted Allward's designation as a person of national historic significance due to his \"...original sense of spatial composition, his mastery of the classical form and his brilliant craftsmanship.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a politician, he served as the mayor of his hometown of Pagsanjan from 1971 to 1975.\n\nZaide was born in Pagsanjan, Laguna on May 25, 1907. He was known as \"Goyo\" to the people of his home town of Pagsanjan. He was married to Lily Magbanua.\n\nHe retired on May 25, 1964 and entered politics, winning as mayor of Pagsanjan from 1971 to 1975. While serving his post, he wrote a book about his town, \"Pagsanjan, In History and Legend\", released in 1975 (of which excerpts are published in the town's official website). Dr. Gregorio F. Zaide died on October 31, 1986.\n\nGregorio Zaide's primary and secondary education were in Spanish language, when it was the social language of the Philippines. He graduated valedictorian from Laguna High School (now called the \"Pedro Guevara Memorial National High School\") in Santa Cruz, Laguna in 1926. He obtained his Master of Arts in 1931 from the University of the Philippines in Manila, his Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in 1934 from the University of Santo Tomas in Manila.\n\nIn his time, he was the most traveled Filipino historian, with teaching and research stints at various universities and institutions in the Philippines and around the world. He worked at the University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City; at the University of Santo Tomas, San Beda College, University of Manila, and Far Eastern University in Manila. He also taught and researched for the University of Hawaii and around the United States, as well as at the United Nations and around Asia. As a fluent speaker of the Spanish language, he worked in Mexico, and other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. He became a member of \"Instituto Historico de la Independencia Americana\" (Historical Institute of American Independence) in Argentina and the \"Instituto Panamericano de Geografia e Historia\" (Pan American Institute of Geography and History) in Mexico.\n\nHe was elected as President of the Philippine Historical Association and served in this capacity for three terms - between 1965-1966 and in 1971.

{"id": "23963520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23963520", "title": "History of the Burgess Shale", "text": "History of the Burgess Shale\n\nThe Burgess Shale, a series of fossil beds in the Canadian Rockies, was first noticed in 1886 by Richard McConnell of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). His and subsequent finds, all from the Mount Stephen area, came to the attention of palaeontologist Charles Doolittle Walcott, who in 1907 found time to reconnoitre the area. He opened a quarry in 1910 and in a series of field trips brought back 65,000 specimens, which he identified as Middle Cambrian in age. Due to the quantity of fossils and the pressures of his other duties at the Smithsonian Institution, Walcott was only able to publish a series of \"preliminary\" papers, in which he classified the fossils within taxa that were already established. In a series of visits beginning in 1924, Harvard University professor Percy Raymond collected further fossils from Walcott's quarry and higher up on Fossil Ridge, where slightly different fossils were preserved.\n\nInterest in the area's fossil beds faded after Raymond's 1930s expeditions. In the early 1960s Harry B. Whittington was persuaded that further investigation was required, and organised surveys in partnership with the Geological Survey of Canada. These new specimens led him to set up a team to re-examine Walcott's fossils, which had languished in a store-room at the Smithsonian since Walcott's death in 1927. In the early 1970s the team published papers that diagnosed many of the specimens as fossils of previously unknown types of animals, some possibly belonging to new phyla. These analyses heightened interest in the existing debate about whether the Cambrian explosion represented a truly abrupt evolution of recognisable animals or was the result of a longer development, most of which was hidden by gaps in the known sets of fossils that had been found.\n\nAll this time no Canadian museum had its own collection of Burgess Shale fossils. In 1975 the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) began collecting, found 7,750 new specimens around the existing sites, and discovered similar fossil beds up to away. Their collection currently stands at 140,000 specimens and growing, and the rate at which new species are found suggests that the Burgess Shale will continue to produce important discoveries for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe richness of fossils in the Field area was first identified by workers associated with the construction of the Trans-Canada railway, which had (somewhat controversially) been routed through the Kicking Horse valley. Richard McConnell, of the Geological Survey of Canada, was mapping the geology around the railway line in September 1886, and was pointed to the Mount Stephen trilobite beds by a construction worker. Several unusual fossils were subsequently described from this site, including sponges, worms, and the appendages of the unusual \"Anomalocaris\", identified at that time as the bodies of crabs. Some of these fossils found their way to Charles Doolittle Walcott, who described them and correctly estimated their Middle Cambrian age. These fossils whetted Walcott's appetite for the region, but it was not until 1907 that the opportunity arose for him to visit Mount Stephen in person.\n\n1908 saw a rich crop of publications as Walcott worked on the material he had collected the previous year, and towards the end of August 1909 he returned to the Field area. That summer, Walcott had visited England to participate in the celebration of Darwin's centenary. Whilst there, he had met the Natural History Museum curator Henry Woodward, who had suggested that the nearby Mount Field may yield further fossils of the ilk of the Trilobite beds. Promptly upon his arrival in Field, Walcott ascended the slopes of Mount Field via Burgess Pass. This pass, probably one of the many constructed by the CPR in an effort to attract tourists, led along what is now called Fossil Ridge. Walcott recognised the talus material which lay across the trail as the Stephen Formation, and noticed interesting fossils. This find is often considered to be the first discovery of the Burgess Shale 'proper'. He spent several more days collecting on Fossil Ridge before returning to Mount Stephen to bolster his collections from the Trilobite Beds.\n\nThe subsequent year saw more intensive collecting by Walcott. He and his two sons systematically investigated every stratum of rock to locate the source of the block they had found the previous summer. They eventually identified the productive layers, including the Phyllopod bed, in what would become the Walcott Quarry. They began to excavate this outcrop, sending blocks by pack horse to Walcott's wife, who split the shale and prepared fossils for transportation downhill to Field, and onwards by rail to Washington. While reporting his finds in the following year, Walcott first coined the term 'Burgess Shale', proposing it to form a facies within the Stephen Formation. These reports covered many now-familiar animal genera, although few of Walcott's proposed classifications would stand the test of time; they were also Walcott's final publications on Burgess Shale animals.\n\nWalcott and his family returned to the quarry each summer until 1913, using dynamite as surface collection dried up. During this time, his wife died in a train crash and his eldest son died of tubercolosis. He considered his next trip, in 1917, to have \"practically exhausted\" the quarry, with 1300 kg of material being collected that year. He returned to take additional collections, mainly from talus material, in 1919, 1921, and 1924, amassing a total of 65,000 fossil specimens over 30,000 slabs. During these years, he made further preliminary descriptions of the less glamorous sponges and algae. He photographed and clearly intended to describe many further taxa, many of which sat alone with their photograph in a Smithsonian drawer for decades after Walcott's death. Unfortunately, administrative duties became a growing burden on Walcott's time, and the Burgess took a back seat to the completion of his attempts to document the stratigraphy of the southern Rockies, an extensive work which he did not live to see published.\n\nThree years before Walcott died in 1927, the Harvard University professor Percy Raymond led a group of summer-school students to Walcott's camp and quarry. These field trips became a regular fixture, and Raymond's interest in the fossils led him to obtain permission to re-open the quarry. He also determined that a level slightly further up-slope, recognised but not exploited by Walcott, bore a slightly different fauna, and opened a new quarry – now termed the Raymond Quarry – at this level.\n\nAfter Raymond's few excursions, the Burgess Shale faded somewhat into obscurity. Walcott's third wife, Mary Vaux, discouraged access to the collections, which gathered dust on high shelves in the Smithsonian Institution. Harry Whittington, then of Harvard University, was to prove the catalyst that renewed interest in the site. As he showed a visiting trilobite expert around Raymond's collections, the necessity of a restudy was pointed out to Whittington, who proceeded to lobby the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) to revisit the locality. They did, and as a leading authority on trilobites, Whittington was the logical choice to head the palaeontological investigations in the arthropod-rich Shale. In the company of Jim Aitken and Bill Fritz, he led a GSC reconnaissance expedition in 1966; fellow trilobitologist David Bruton joined the crew the next year as they went out to quarry in force. Dynamite was used in only the smallest quantities, with closely spaced drill holes used to separate large blocks of rock, and large slabs were collected systematically from the Walcott and Raymond quarries. These were labelled with their stratigraphic level, helicoptered from the mountain face, and returned to Whittington's base at the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge for further study. The 1967 operation resulted in the description of new animals, including the earliest known crinoid and a complete \"Anomalocaris\". Initially, detailed descriptions were made of some of the most common arthropod-like organisms: \"Marrella\", \"Sidneyia\" and \"Burgessia\". These redescriptions were slow and laborious, making extensive use of the camera lucida technique for microscope drawing, with papers based extensively around detailed drawing of the fossil specimens. It soon became clear that the Burgess Shale was even more exceptional than previously thought – soft tissue was preserved to an exquisite quality, allowing insights into early life that had never before been dreamed of, and preserving a range of non-mineralising taxa which are otherwise invisible in the fossil record. With an overwhelmingly diverse fauna in need of cataloguing, Harry Whittington set his two new graduate students to the task, assigning Derek Briggs and Simon Conway Morris the arthropods and 'worms', respectively. This work began to lift the veil on an unexpectedly diverse ecosystem, with almost as much variety as seen in the modern oceans – the old theory that Cambrian life was simple, straightforward and slightly dull disintegrated further with each new fossil described. This view was reinforced with the identification of other Burgess Shale-type deposits elsewhere in the world, a search for which was triggered by the discovery of the Chengjiang and Sirius Passet lagerstätten in 1984.\n\nIn February 2014, the discovery was announced of another Burgess Shale outcrop in Kootenay National Park to the south. In just 15 days of field collecting in 2013, 50 animal species were unearthed at the new site.\n\nUntil 1975, no Canadian museum had its own collection of Burgess Shale fossils. With the work of the GSC and its associates, the shale was rising to prominence, and in 1975 the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) obtained permission from the National Parks authority, Parks Canada, to collect fossils from talus material in order to develop its own display. Parks Canada would redirect other museums' requests for material to the ROM, so the 1975 collection team gathered ample specimens to meet the anticipated teaching and display requirements. As well as 7750 specimens, this expedition yielded evidence that further fossil outcrops existed up-slope, and in 1981 a five-year reconnaissance program begun. This program would unearth further sites higher on Fossil Ridge; further around the steep cliffs of Mount Stephen; and on Odaray Mountain. These sites proved very productive, bearing a different fauna and spanning more time than the original beds. Excavation by ROM crews continues to this day, and has found fossils below the base of Walcott's quarry, and some 40 km away near the Stanley Glacier. The ROM's collections now stand proud of 140,000 specimens, and is continually yielding important new species and redescriptions. Statistical analysis suggests that new species will continue to be discovered for years to come.\n\nIn 1981, UNESCO recognised the importance of the Burgess Shale by naming it a World Heritage site. Access to the Fossil Ridge quarries and Trilobite beds is now possible only as part of a guided group, and the sites are under continuous surveillance by Parks Canada, with hefty fines for removing or defacing fossil material.\n\nTo mark the hundredth anniversary of Walcott's discovery of the main Burgess Shale site on Fossil Ridge, an international conference of 150 specialists in the field was held in Banff, Alberta, in August 2009. It featured technical and keynote sessions reporting on the latest research in the field, and field hikes to the Shale itself.\n"}

The classical era of Latin literature can be roughly divided into the following periods: Early Latin literature, The Golden Age, The Imperial Period and Late Antiquity.\n\nLatin was the language of the ancient Romans, but it was also the \"lingua franca\" of Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages, so Latin literature includes not only Roman authors like Cicero, Vergil, Ovid and Horace, but also includes European writers after the fall of the Empire, from religious writers like Aquinas (1225–1274), to secular writers like Francis Bacon (1561–1626), Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), and Isaac Newton (1642–1727).\n\nFormal Latin literature began in 240 BC, when a Roman audience saw a Latin version of a Greek play. The adaptor was Livius Andronicus, a Greek who had been brought to Rome as a prisoner of war in 272 BC. Andronicus also translated Homer's Greek epic the \"Odyssey\" into an old type of Latin verse called \"Saturnian\". The first Latin poet to write on a Roman theme was Gnaeus Naevius during the 3rd century BC. He composed an epic poem about the first Punic War, in which he had fought. Naevius's dramas were mainly reworkings of Greek originals, but he also created tragedies based on Roman myths and history.\n\nOther epic poets followed Naevius. Quintus Ennius wrote a historical epic, the \"Annals\" (soon after 200 BC), describing Roman history from the founding of Rome to his own time. He adopted Greek dactylic hexameter, which became the standard verse form for Roman epics. He also became famous for his tragic dramas. In this field, his most distinguished successors were Marcus Pacuvius and Lucius Accius. These three writers rarely used episodes from Roman history. Instead, they wrote Latin versions of tragic themes that the Greeks had already handled. But even when they copied the Greeks, they did not translate slavishly. Only fragments of their plays have survived.\n\nConsiderably more is known about early Latin comedy, as 26 Early Latin comedies are extant – 20 of which Plautus wrote, and the remaining six of which Terence wrote. These men modeled their comedies on Greek plays known as New Comedy. But they treated the plots and wording of the originals freely. Plautus scattered songs through his plays and increased the humor with puns and wisecracks, plus comic actions by the actors. Terence's plays were more polite in tone, dealing with domestic situations. His works provided the chief inspiration for French and English comedies of the 17th century AD, and even for modern American comedy.\n\nThe prose of the period is best known through \"On Agriculture\" (160 BC) by Cato the Elder. Cato also wrote the first Latin history of Rome and of other Italian cities. He was the first Roman statesman to put his political speeches in writing as a means of influencing public opinion.\n\nEarly Latin literature ended with Gaius Lucilius, who created a new kind of poetry in his 30 books of \"Satires\" (2nd century BC). He wrote in an easy, conversational tone about books, food, friends, and current events.\n\nTraditionally, the height of Latin literature has been assigned to the period from 81 BC to AD 17, although recent scholarship has questioned the assumptions that privileged the works of this period over both earlier and later works. This period is usually said to have begun with the first known speech of Cicero and ended with the death of Ovid.\n\nCicero has traditionally been considered the master of Latin prose. The writing he produced from about 80 BC until his death in 43 BC exceeds that of any Latin author whose work survives in terms of quantity and variety of genre and subject matter, as well as possessing unsurpassed stylistic excellence. Cicero's many works can be divided into four groups: (1) letters, (2) rhetorical treatises, (3) philosophical works, and (4) orations. His letters provide detailed information about an important period in Roman history and offer a vivid picture of the public and private life among the Roman governing class. Cicero's works on oratory are our most valuable Latin sources for ancient theories on education and rhetoric. His philosophical works were the basis of moral philosophy during the Middle Ages. His speeches inspired many European political leaders and the founders of the United States.\n\nJulius Caesar and Sallust were outstanding historical writers of Cicero's time. Caesar wrote commentaries on the Gallic and civil wars in a straightforward style to justify his actions as a general. Sallust adopted an abrupt, pointed style in his historical works. He wrote brilliant descriptions of people and their motives.\n\nThe birth of lyric poetry in Latin occurred during the same period. The short love lyrics of Catullus are noted for their emotional intensity. Catullus also wrote poems that attacked his enemies. In his longer poems, he suggested images in rich, delicate language.\n\nOne of the most learned writers of the period was Marcus Terentius Varro. Called \"the most learned of the Romans\" by Quintillian, he wrote about a remarkable variety of subjects, from religion to poetry. But only his writings on agriculture and the Latin language are extant in their complete form.\n\nThe emperor Augustus took a personal interest in the literary works produced during his years of power from 27 BC to AD 14. This period is sometimes called the Augustan Age of Latin Literature. Virgil published his pastoral \"Eclogues\", the \"Georgics\", and the \"Aeneid\", an epic poem describing the events that led to the creation of Rome. Virgil told how the Trojan hero Aeneas became the ancestor of the Roman people. Virgil also provided divine justification for Roman rule over the world. Although Virgil died before he could put the finishing touches on his poem, it was soon recognized as the greatest work of Latin literature.\n\nVirgil's friend Horace wrote \"Epodes\", \"Odes\", \"Satires\", and \"Epistles\". The perfection of the \"Odes\" in content, form, and style has charmed readers for hundreds of years. The \"Satires\" and \"Epistles\" discuss ethical and literary problems in an urbane, witty manner. Horace's \"Art of Poetry\", probably published as a separate work, greatly influenced later poetic theories. It stated the basic rules of classical writing as the Romans understood and used them. After Virgil died, Horace was Rome's leading poet.\n\nThe Latin elegy reached its highest development in the works of Tibullus, Propertius, and Ovid. Most of this poetry is concerned with love. Ovid also wrote the \"Fasti\", which describes Roman festivals and their legendary origins. Ovid's greatest work, the \"Metamorphoses\" weaves various myths into a fast-paced, fascinating story. Ovid was a witty writer who excelled in creating lively and passionate characters. The \"Metamorphoses\" was the best-known source of Greek and Roman mythology throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. It inspired many poets, painters, and composers.\n\nIn prose, Livy produced a history of the Roman people in 142 books. Only 35 survived, but they are a major source of information on Rome.\n\nFrom the death of Augustus in AD 14 until about 200, Roman authors emphasized style and tried new and startling ways of expression. During the reign of Nero from 54 to 68, the Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote a number of dialogues and letters on such moral themes as mercy and generosity. In his \"Natural Questions\", Seneca analyzed earthquakes, floods, and storms. Seneca's tragedies greatly influenced the growth of tragic drama in Europe. His nephew Lucan wrote the \"Pharsalia\" (about 60), an epic poem describing the civil war between Caesar and Pompey. The \"Satyricon\" (about 60) by Petronius was the first Latin novel. Only fragments of the complete work survive. It describes the adventures of various low-class characters in absurd, extravagant, and dangerous situations, often in the world of petty crime.\n\nEpic poems included the \"Argonautica\" of Gaius Valerius Flaccus, the \"Thebaid\" of Statius, and the \"Punica\" of Silius Italicus. At the hands of Martial, the epigram achieved the stinging quality still associated with it. Juvenal brilliantly satirized vice.\n\nThe historian Tacitus painted an unforgettably dark picture of the early empire in his \"Histories\" and \"Annals\", both written in the early 2nd century. His contemporary Suetonius wrote biographies of the 12 Roman rulers from Julius Caesar through Domitian. The letters of Pliny the Younger described Roman life of the period. Quintilian composed the most complete work on ancient education that we possess. Important works from the 2nd century include the \"Attic Nights\" of Aulus Gellius, a collection of anecdotes and reports of literary discussions among his friends; and the letters of the orator Marcus Cornelius Fronto to Marcus Aurelius. The most famous work of the period was \"Metamorphoses\", also called \"The Golden Ass\", by Apuleius. This novel concerns a young man who is accidentally changed into a donkey. The story is filled with colorful tales of love and witchcraft.\n\nPagan Latin literature showed a final burst of vitality in the late 3rd century through 5th centuries. Ammianus Marcellinus in history, Quintus Aurelius Symmachus in oratory, and Ausonius and Rutilius Claudius Namatianus in poetry all wrote with great talent. The \"Mosella\" by Ausonius demonstrated a modernism of feeling that indicates the end of classical literature as such.\n\nAt the same time, other men laid the foundations of Christian Latin literature during the 4th century and 5th century. They included the church fathers Augustine of Hippo, Jerome, and Ambrose, and the first great Christian poet, Prudentius.\n\nDuring the Renaissance there was a return to the Latin of Classical times, called for this reason Neo-Latin. This purified language continued to be used as the \"lingua franca\" among the learned throughout Europe, with the great works of Descartes, Francis Bacon, and Baruch Spinoza all being composed in Latin. Among the last important books written primarily in Latin prose were the works of Swedenborg (d. 1772), Linnaeus (d. 1778), Euler (d. 1783), Gauss (d. 1855), and Isaac Newton (d. 1727), and Latin remains a necessary skill for modern readers of great early modern works of linguistics, literature, and philosophy.\n\nSeveral of the leading English poets wrote in Latin as well as English. Milton's 1645 Poems are one example, but there were also Thomas Campion, George Herbert and Milton's colleague Andrew Marvell. Some indeed wrote chiefly in Latin and were valued for the elegance and Classicism of their style. Examples of these were Anthony Alsop and Vincent Bourne, who were noted for the ingenious way that they adapted their verse to describing details of life in the 18th century while never departing from the purity of Latin diction. One of the last to be noted for the quality of his Latin verse well into the 19th century was Walter Savage Landor.\n\nMuch Latin writing reflects the Romans' interest in rhetoric, the art of speaking and persuading. Public speaking had great importance for educated Romans because most of them wanted successful political careers. When Rome was a republic, effective speaking often determined who would be elected or what bills would pass. After Rome became an empire, the ability to impress and persuade people by the spoken word lost much of its importance. But training in rhetoric continued to flourish and to affect styles of writing. A large part of rhetoric consists of the ability to present a familiar idea in a striking new manner that attracts attention. Latin authors became masters of this art of variety.\n\nLatin is a highly \"inflected\" language, with many grammatical forms for various words. As a result, it can be used with a pithiness and brevity unknown in English. It also lends itself to elaboration, because its tight syntax holds even the longest and most complex sentence together as a logical unit. Latin can be used with striking conciseness, as in the works of Sallust and Tacitus. Or it can have wide, sweeping phrases, as in the works of Livy and the speeches of Cicero.\n\nLatin lacks the rich poetic vocabulary that marks the Greek poetry. Some earlier Latin poets tried to make up for this deficiency by creating new compound words, as the Greeks had done. But Roman writers seldom invented words. Except in epic poetry, they tended to use a familiar vocabulary, giving it poetic value by imaginative combinations of words and by rich sound effects. Rome's leading poets had great technical skill in the choice and arrangement of language. They also had an intimate knowledge of the Greek poets, whose themes appear in almost all Roman literature.\n\nLatin moves with impressive dignity in the writings of Ovid, Cicero, or Virgil. It reflects the seriousness and sense of responsibility that characterized the ruling class of Rome during the great years of the republic. But the Romans could also relax and allow what Horace called the \"Italian vinegar\" in their systems to pour forth in wit and satire.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "179444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179444", "title": "Leslie Charteris", "text": "Leslie Charteris\n\nLeslie Charteris (born Leslie Charles Bowyer-Yin, 12 May 1907 – 15 April 1993), was a British-Chinese author of adventure fiction, as well as a screenwriter. He was best known for his many books chronicling the adventures of the charming antihero Simon Templar, alias \"The Saint.\"\n\nCharteris was born in Singapore to a Chinese father, Dr S. C. Yin (Yin Suat Chwan, 1877–1958), and his wife Lydia Florence Bowyer, who was English. His father was a physician, who claimed to be able to trace his lineage back to the emperors of the Shang Dynasty.\n\nCharteris became interested in writing at an early age. At one point, he created his own magazine with articles, short stories, poems, editorials, serials, and even a comic strip. He attended Rossall School in Fleetwood, Lancashire, England.\n\nOnce his first book, written during his first year at King's College, Cambridge, was accepted, he left the university and embarked on a new career. Charteris was motivated by a desire to be unconventional and to become financially well off by doing what he liked to do. He continued to write English thriller stories, while he worked at various jobs from shipping out on a freighter to working as a barman in a country inn. He prospected for gold, dived for pearls, worked in a tin mine and on a rubber plantation, toured England with a carnival, and drove a bus. In 1926, he legally changed his last name to Charteris, after Colonel Francis Charteris , although, in the BBC Radio 4 documentary \"Leslie Charteris – A Saintly Centennial\", his daughter stated that he selected his surname from the telephone directory.\n\nHis third novel, \"Meet the Tiger\" (1928), introduced his most famous creation, Simon Templar. However, in his 1980 introduction to a reprint by Charter Books, Charteris indicated he was dissatisfied with the work, suggesting its only value was as the start of the long-running Saint series. Occasionally, he chose to ignore the existence of \"Meet the Tiger\" altogether and claimed that the Saint series actually began with the second volume, \"Enter the Saint\" (1930); an example of this can be found in the introduction Charteris wrote to an early 1960s edition of \"Enter the Saint\" published by Fiction Publishing Company (an imprint of Doubleday).\n\nAlthough he wrote a few other books (including a novelisation of his screenplay for the Deanna Durbin mystery-comedy \"Lady on a Train\", and the English translation of \"Juan Belmonte: Killer of Bulls\" by Manuel Chaves Nogales), his lifework — at least in the literary world — consisted primarily of Simon Templar Saint adventures, which were presented in novel, novella, and short-story formats over the next 35 years (with other authors ghost writing the stories on Charteris' behalf from 1963 onward; Charteris acted as an editor for these books, approving stories and making revisions when needed).\n\nCharteris relocated to the United States in 1932, where he continued to publish short stories and also became a writer for Paramount Pictures, working on the George Raft film, \"Midnight Club\". \n\nHowever, Charteris was excluded from permanent residency in the United States because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a law which prohibited immigration for persons of \"50% or greater\" Oriental blood. As a result, Charteris was forced to continually renew his six-month temporary visitor's visa. Eventually, an act of Congress personally granted his daughter and him the right of permanent residence in the United States, with eligibility for naturalisation, which he later completed.\n\nIn America, \"The Saint\" became a radio series starring Vincent Price. In the 1940s, Charteris, besides continuing to write \"The Saint\" stories, scripted the \"Sherlock Holmes\" radio series featuring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. In 1941, Charteris appeared in a \"Life\" photographic adaptation of a short story of \"The Saint\", with himself playing the Saint. \n\nLong-term success eluded Charteris' creation outside the literary arena until RKO produced an eight film series between 1938 and 1943: \nThe Saint in New York (1938) with Louis Hayward as The Saint;\nThe Saint Strikes Back (1939), \nThe Saint in London (1939), \nThe Saint's Double Trouble (1940),\nThe Saint Takes Over (1940), and \nThe Saint in Palm Springs (1941) all with George Sanders as The Saint; Hugh Sinclair took over the role in The Saint's Vacation (1941) and The Saint Meets the Tiger (produced in 1941 but not released until 1943).\n\nA ninth film, The Saint's Return (known as The Saint's Girl Friday in the US) from 1953, with Louis Hayward returning as The Saint, is sometimes regarded as part of the RKO series. However, it was produced by British Hammer Film Productions 12 years after the conflict between Charteris and RKO, based on a special agreement between Hammer Films and Leslie Charteris, which gave Charteris a percentage in the film. RKO acted only as the film's US distributor, six months after the UK release.\n\nIn 1962–1969 the British-produced television series \"The Saint\" went into production with Roger Moore in the Simon Templar role.\n\nMany episodes of the TV series were based upon Charteris' short stories. Later, as original scripts were commissioned, Charteris permitted some of these scripts to be novelised and published as further adventures of the Saint in printed form (these later books, with titles such as \"The Saint on TV\" and \"The Saint and the Fiction Makers\", carried Charteris' name as author, but were in fact written by others). Charteris lived to see a second British TV series, \"Return of the Saint\" starring Ian Ogilvy as Simon Templar, enjoy a well-received, if brief, run, and in the 1980s, a series of TV movies produced by an international co-production and starring Simon Dutton kept interest in \"The Saint\" alive. Also, an ill-fated attempt at a 1980s TV series was made in the United States, which resulted in only a pilot episode being produced and broadcast. He also produced the original theme tune to the series, as can be seen on the end credits.\n\nThe adventures of \"The Saint\" were chronicled in nearly 100 books (about 50 published in the UK and US, with others published in France). Charteris himself stepped away from writing the books after \"The Saint in the Sun\" (1963). The next year, \"Vendetta for the Saint\" was published and while it was credited to Charteris, it was actually written by science fiction writer Harry Harrison. Following \"Vendetta\", as noted above, came a number of books adapting televised episodes; these books were credited to Charteris, but were actually by others (although Charteris himself did collaborate on several Saint books in the 1970s). Several \"Return of the Saint\" scripts were also adapted, and some original stories were thrown into the mix. Charteris appears to have served in an editorial capacity for these later volumes. He also edited (and contributed to) \"The Saint Mystery Magazine\", a digest-sized publication. The final book in the Saint series was \"Salvage for the Saint\", published in 1983. Two additional books were published in 1997, a novelization of the film loosely based on the character, and an original novel published by \"The Saint Club\", a fan club that Charteris himself founded in the 1930s. Both books were written by Burl Barer, who also wrote the definitive history on Charteris and \"The Saint\".\n\nCharteris spent 55 years - 1928 to 1983 - as either writer of or custodian of Simon Templar's literary adventures, one of the longest uninterrupted spans of a single author in the history of mystery fiction, equalling that of Agatha Christie, who wrote her novels and stories featuring the detective Hercule Poirot over a similar 55-year period.\n\nBesides being a fiction writer, Charteris also wrote a column on cuisine for an American magazine as a sideline. He also invented a wordless, pictorial sign language called Paleneo and wrote a book on it. In addition, Charteris was also one of the earliest members of Mensa.\n\nIn 1952, Charteris married Hollywood actress Audrey Long (1922-2014); the couple eventually returned to England, where he spent his last years living in Surrey.\n\nCharteris died at Princess Margaret's Hospital Windsor, Berkshire, on 15 April 1993, and was survived by his wife and a daughter, Patricia.\n\nHe was married four times:\n\nCharteris was the brother of Rev Roy Bowyer-Yin.\n\nFor a list of all Charteris's works, see List of works by Leslie Charteris; for a breakdown of Simon Templar novels, novellas and short story collections by Charteris, see the list at Simon Templar.\n\nIn addition, Charteris authored numerous uncollected short stories and essays.\n\n"}

The purpose of Maison Shalom was to improve the lives of Burundi’s children through integrated and sustainable development, with the ultimate aim of fostering a lasting peace in Burundi.\nHowever, in 2015 “Maggy” was forced to flee her country and Maison Shalom, after Burundi plunged into a political crisis. Far from surrendering, “Maggy” decided to dedicate all her energy to help more than 90.000 Burundian refugees in Rwanda. In 2017, she opened the Community Center Oasis of Peace in Kigali order to school children, offer psychosocial support to victims of torture and rape, and to implement activities of sustainable development in areas such as health, education, vocational training, culture and income-generation. As she often says herself, Maggy's vision is to instill dignity in the refugees and to allow them to keep their dreams alive: “Evil never has the last word – love always wins”.\n\nMaggy is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Aurora Prize for Awakening Humanity (2016), the Opus Prize (2008), the Prize for Conflict Prevention (2011), UNESCO (2008), the Nansen Refugee Award (2005), the Four Freedoms Award from the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute (2004), the Voices of Courage Award of the Women’s Commission for Women and Refugee Children (2004), the World Children’s prize (2003), the Juan Maria Bandres Prize for Asylum Rights (1998), and the French Government’s Human Rights Prize (1998).\n\nMarguerite - “Maggy” - Barankitse was born in 1957 in Ruyigi, East-Burundi, one of the poorest regions of the country. She was a teacher at a local secondary school, but was fired because of her protests against discrimination between Hutus and Tutsis in the field of education. She then went to work as a secretary for the Catholic Bishop in Ruyigi. Despite mounting tensions, Maggy put her dream of ethnic harmony into practice by adopting seven children: four Hutus and three Tutsis. As violence escalated between Hutus and Tutsis following the assassination of the first democratically elected president of Burundi, a group of armed Tutsis descended on Ruyigi on October 23rd 1993 to kill the Hutu families who were hiding in the Bishop’s manor. Maggy managed to hide many of the children, but was caught by the fighters. They beat and humiliated her and forced her to watch the killing of 72 Hutus, but she refused to tell them where the children were hidden. Ultimately, she was spared only because she is a Tutsi. After this ordeal, Maggy gathered her adopted children and the surviving orphans and hid them in a nearby school. As more and more children sought shelter with her, she decided to create a small non-governmental organisation: Maison Shalom, the House of Peace. Maggy’s house was open to children of all ethnic origins: Tutsi, Hutu and Twa. She calls them “my Hutsitwa children”, and they call her \"Oma\" (or grandmother in German). In the following years, Maison Shalom in Ruyigi was one of the few places in Burundi where Hutus and Tutsis cohabited in harmony. \n\nSince the terrible events of 1993, over 20,000 children and youth have benefited from Maison Shalom. Before the current crisis in Burundi, the organisation employed more than 270 people, including nurses, psychologists, and educators who implemented special projects for the children. \n\nIn April 2015, Maggy spoke out against the third term of Pierre Nkurunziza and joined the youth demonstrations denouncing the president. As a result, she was obliged to hide for a month in an embassy in Bujumbura. Eventually, she had to flee, for the government had her name on a list of persons to be eliminated. Having joined the youth demonstrations denouncing the president who sought a third term, Maggy found herself a refugee. \n\nBut her refugee status did not stop Maggy’s devotion to alleviate suffering. She has now opened a branch of Maison Shalom in Rwanda.\n\nIn the autumn of 1993, after the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye, first democratically elected president of Burundi (Hutu), the Burundian civil war began with massacres taking place throughout the country. In the province of Ruyigi, disaster struck on 24 October. To exact vengeance for the killing of members of their ethnic group, the Tutsi hunted the town’s Hutus, who were hiding in the diocese buildings. Maggy (Tutsi) was also there and she tried to reason with the group of Tutsi to convince them not to use violence. However, her efforts were in vain and they decided to tie her to a chair and forced her to watch the killing of 72 of her friends in front of her. \nA few hours after the massacre, the children of the victims started to come out of their hiding places. That day, Maggy says, she realized that her mission would be to fight the violence ravaging her country by giving those children, and the 20,000 who would follow, an alternative to hate.. Amid the prevailing disaster, the news had spread rapidly about the “crazy woman of Ruyigi” who dared to take in all the orphans who came to her, never refusing anyone. Twa, Hutu, Tutsi: Maggy made no distinction. \n\nMaggy initially gathered the 25 orphaned of the Ruyigi massacre. With the help of European and Burundian friends, she organized a network that provided care for a growing number of children. In May 1994, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ruyigi, Bishop Joseph Nduhirubusa agreed to transform a former school into a children's shelter called 'Maison Shalom'. The shelter was named so named by the children, in memory of a song heard on the radio at the time, and because the word \"peace\", in Kirundi had himself been instrumentalized and defiled by the slaughterers on both sides of the conflict.\n\nMaison Shalom’s focus was also predominantly children, including child soldiers, orphans, mutilated children and minors in prison. However, the services of Maison Shalom were available to the entire community, changed having an impact not only on the lives of orphans, but also the entire region that could access to these services. While services were available to the entire community, the focus was on children, some of whom were child soldiers, orphans, mutilated child and minors in prison. Maison Shalom’s activities soon also expanded to other cities such as Butezi and Gizuru, where Maggy opened other children's shelters were opened.\n\nOver the years, what was just a shelter seeking to protect orphans from both sides of the Burundian ethnic divide after the civil war, grew into an entire village, (including a bank, a crèche, an hotel, a shop, resource centre for learning sewing and computing, a mechanic training, a swimming pool, the REMA Hospital, and even a cinema).\nMany of those activities were income-generating initiatives run by the youth themselves, such as the guesthouse, the cinema, the car workshop, etc. When they became independent, the young people supported by Maison Shalom received a small house and a plot of land. \n\nIn 2004 an estimated 20,000 children had benefited from her help, either directly or indirectly.\n\nBy 2015, over 300 houses for children and youth aged between 4 and 20 had been built. The NGO also helped internally displaced persons and returning Burundian refugees to reintegrate in Ruyigi and to trace their missing relatives. Maggy Barankitse was on the frontline in the battle against HIV/AIDS, setting up counselling projects to promote HIV/AIDS prevention. She and her staff cared for over 100 HIV infected children who had been abandoned or orphaned. \nMaggy also started an initiative to help the youth who were in prison. Some children were born in prison and she worked to find them a better life, through education and a home outside the prison. Her team continued to promote agriculture and established a microfinance project to enable the mothers and fathers to develop small businesses.\n\nBut in 2015, everything fell apart. The Burundian government started suppressing protests against a third term for President Nkurunziza. Thousands of Burundians started fleeing to Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania or the DRC. Maggy protests, cares for the wounded young, and feeds those who are in prison. But in June 2015, Marguerite Barankitse is herself forced to flee. In Burundi, her head is priced.\n\nFar from surrendering, Maggy refused to spend comfortably her days in Europe and instead decided to dedicate all her energy to help more than 90.000 Burundian refugees in Rwanda.\n\nMaggy started with her expertise; education. She fought to get an education for children and university students who are in refugee camps. She has put 126 children in preschool, 160 in secondary school and obtained 353 scholarships for University refugee students to join Rwandan universities, and 10 scholarships for the best students to study in universities abroad.\n\nIn May 2017, Maggy opened the Community Center Oasis of Peace in order to school children, offer psychosocial support to victims of torture and rape, and to implement activities of sustainable development in areas such as health, education, vocational training, culture, and income-generation.\nThe Centre already offers a variety of courses including English language, culinary arts, tailoring, embroidery and painting. It also has a restaurant and a cyber equipped with computers with internet connection for research and basic computer training. Approximately 200 people come every day to the Centre and benefit from the various services offered by Maison Shalom.\n\nMaison Shalom seeks to help refugees and especially young people in exile to live in dignity, to use the exile for empowerment and to forgiveness for those who forced them to flee their homeland.\n\nSince 2015, more than 430.000 Burundians have been forced to flee and to seek refuge in neighbouring countries such as Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda. Among them, more than 90.000 are in Rwanda, of which 58.000 live in Mahama refugee camp. This camp is now considered to be a model case of refugee management in the East African Region. \n\nTo support the refugees living in the camp, Maison Shalom opened the Mahama Elite Center on 22nd of June 2018. \n\nThis training center at Mahama refugee camp will offer vocational training and employment to Burundian refugees in the camp. The project will enable young people not only to improve their living conditions but also to strengthen their entrepreneurship skills.\n\nThe scope of her action, as well as the fact that she protects all children without consideration of their origin, Tutsi or Hutu, brought Maggy praise from all corners of the world:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "1791995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791995", "title": "Missing years (Jewish calendar)", "text": "Missing years (Jewish calendar)\n\nThe missing years in the Hebrew calendar refer to a chronological discrepancy between Talmudic chronologists for the destruction of the First Temple in 423 BCE (3338 AM) and the modern secular dating for it in 587 BCE.\n\nBoth the Babylonian Chronicles and the biblical Chronicles indicate that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, but secular scholars have attempted to set a year when the event took place. The Babylonian Chronicles, which were published by Donald Wiseman in 1956, establish that Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem the first time on 2 Adar (16 March) 597 BCE. The Chronicles, with the names of Jewish kings, is derived from British Museum – Cuneiform tablet with part of the Babylonian Chronicle (605–594 BC), (See also Chronicle Concerning the Early Years of Nebuchadnezzar II Reverse, lines 11'–13')\n\nIn the seventh year (of Nebuchadnezzar, 599 BCE) in the month Chislev (Nov/Dec) the king of Babylon assembled his army, and after he had invaded the land of Hatti (northern Syria and southern Anatolia) he laid siege to the city of Judah. On the second day of the month of Adar (16 March) he conquered the city and took the king (Jeconiah) prisoner. He installed in his place a king (Zedekiah) of his own choice, and after he had received rich tribute, he set forth to Babylon.\n\n6 Against him (Jehoiakim) came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.\n7 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.\n8 ... and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.\n9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem...\n10 And at the return of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. \n\nBefore Wiseman's publication, E. R. Thiele had determined from the biblical texts that Nebuchadnezzar's initial capture of Jerusalem occurred in the spring of 597 BCE, while other scholars, including William F. Albright, more frequently dated the event to 598 BCE.\n\nFrom the date of the first siege of Jerusalem in about 597 BCE to the date of the destruction of the First Temple requires resort to biblical sources.\n\n2 Chronicles 36:11 says:\n\n11 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem\n\nThere has been some debate as to when the second siege of Jerusalem took place. Although there is no dispute that Jerusalem fell the second time in the summer month of Tammuz (), Albright dates the end of Zedekiah's reign (and the fall of Jerusalem) to 587 BCE, whereas Thiele offers 586 BCE.\n\nThiele's reckoning is based on the presentation of Zedekiah's reign on an accession basis, which was used for most but not all of the kings of Judah. In that case, the year that Zedekiah came to the throne would be his \"first\" partial year; his first full year would be 597/596 BCE, and his eleventh year, the year Jerusalem fell, would be 587/586 BCE. Since Judah's regnal years were counted from Tishrei in autumn, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of Jerusalem in the summer of 586 BCE.\n\nThe 2nd century CE rabbinic work Seder Olam Rabbah, which formed the basis of the era counting of the Hebrew calendar, interpreted the prophecy of seventy weeks in as referring to a period of 490 years, with a \"week\" being interpreted as a period of seven years, which would pass between the destruction of the First and Second Temple. This is used to date the destruction of the First Temple to 423 BCE (3338 AM) – about 165 years after the current scholarly dating of the event. The discrepancy between these two dates is referred to as \"missing years\".\n\nToday, Hebrew dating places the creation of the world near the end of \"Year One\" AM and afterwards the first year of Adam's life as \"Year Two\" AM. However, Seder Olam Rabba shows that the Hebrew dating originally counted the first year of Adam's life as \"Year Zero\" AM. This may mean that the Hebrew dating has shifted in the course of history such that traditional dating of ancient events appears two years earlier than the modern Hebrew dating would be.\n\nRabbinic tradition says that the First Temple was destroyed in \"year 3338\" AM and the Second Temple in \"year 3828\" AM. If there was no calendar shift, the Common Era equivalents would be 423 BCE and 68 CE, respectively. If there was a calendar shift, the destructions would have taken place in our years 3339 and 3829 AM, or in 3340 and 3830 AM, and the Common Era equivalents would be 422 BCE and 69 CE, respectively, or 421 BCE and 70 CE.\n\nIf there was no calendar shift, the length of the missing-years period would be 163 years (586 minus 423). If there was a calendar shift, the length of the missing-years period would be 164 or 165 years.\n\nA popular explanation for the missing years suggests that the Jewish sages interpreted the prophecy in as meaning that there would be 490 years from the destruction of the First Temple to the destruction of the Second Temple and, working backwards from the destruction of the Second Temple (in 3828 AM), wrongly dated the destruction of the First Temple (in 3338 AM).\n\nA variation on this argument states that the Jews deliberately altered the dating so that the true date of the \"anointed one\" (Mashiah) mentioned in would be hidden. Other apologists have countered with claims that the dating was indeed altered for one or another reason and should be understood as fable, not history.\n\nThese explanations come from the ambiguous meaning of the word 'week' in Hebrew, which means 'a heptad', or a group of seven. The Hebrew word for 'week' is used to refer to periods of seven days as well as seven years. The understanding of this number as referring to 490 years can also be found in Seder Olam. Christians also interpreted these verses as years and connect them to Jesus, although Rashi's interpretation is such that it upholds the tradition that the anointed one in question is the Persian king Cyrus.\n\nIf traditional dates are assumed to be based on the standard Hebrew calendar, then the differing traditional and modern secular dating of events cannot both be correct. Attempts to reconcile the two systems must show one or both to have errors.\n\nSecular scholars see the discrepancy between the traditional and secular date of the destruction of the First Temple arising as a result of Jewish sages missing out the reign lengths of several Persian kings during the Persian Empire's rule over Israel. Modern secular scholars tally ten Persian kings whose combined reigns total 208 years. By contrast, ancient Jewish sages only mention four Persian kings totaling 52 years. The reigns of several Persian kings appear to be missing from the traditional calculations.\n\nR' Azariah dei Rossi, in \"Me'or Einayim\" (c. 1573), was likely the first Jewish authority to claim that the traditional Hebrew dating is not historically precise regarding the years before the Second Temple.\n\nR' Nachman Krochmal in \"Guide to the perplexed of our times\" (Hebrew, 1851) points to the Greek name Antigonos mentioned in the beginning of Avot as proof that there must have been a longer period to account for this sign of Hellenic influence. He posits that certain books of the Bible such as Kohelet and Isaiah were written or redacted during this period.\n\nR' David Zvi Hoffman (1843–1921) points out that the Mishna in Avot (1:4) in describing the chain of tradition uses the plural \"accepted from them\" even though the previous Mishna only mentions one person. He posits that there must have been another Mishna mentioning two sages that was later removed.\n\nIt has been noted that the traditional account of Jewish history shows a discontinuity in the beginning of the 35th century: The account of Seder Olam Rabbah is complete only until this time. It has been postulated that this work was written to complement another historical work, about subsequent centuries until the time of Hadrian, which is no longer extant.\n\nIt appears that Jewish dating systems only arose in the 35th century, so that precise historical records would naturally have existed only from that time onwards. The Minyan Shtarot system, used to date official Jewish documents, started in the year 3449. According to Lerman's thesis, the year-count \"from Creation\" was established around the same time (see Birkat Hachama).\n\nIt has also been posited that certain calculations in the Talmud compute better according to the secular dating. Two possible harmonizations are proposed by modern rabbis:\n\n\nAttempts have been made to reinterpret the historical evidence to agree with the Rabbinic tradition (see \"Excursus: Rabbinic Tradition\", below), however this approach to the discrepancy is problematic. The reinterpretation of the Greek, Babylonian and Persian sources that is required to support the traditional dating has been achieved only in parts and has not yet been achieved in its entirety. Similar problems face other attempts to revise secular dating (such as those of Peter James and David Rohl) and mainstream scholarship rejects such approaches. Where and how the Gregorian or Julian calendric differential gets factored in, remains another argument entirely.\n\nAccording to the Aramaic Scroll of Antiochus, from the Second Temple's rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes who invaded Judaea, there had transpired 213 years in total. Quoting verbatim from that ancient Aramaic record:\nבִּשׁנַת עַסרִין וּתלָת שְׁנִין לְמִמלְכֵיהּ, בִּשׁנַת מָאתַן וּתלָת עֲסַר שְׁנִין לְבִניַין בֵּית אֱלָהָא דֵיך, שַׁוִּי אַנפּוֹהִי לְמִיסַּק לִירוּשְׁלֵם\n\nLiteral translation: \"In the twenty third year of his kingdom, in the two-hundred and thirteenth year of the rebuilding of this, God's house, he (Antiochus Eupator) put his face to go up to Jerusalem.\"\n\nThis timeframe is taken in conjunction with another date in the Seleucid Era counting mentioned by Josephus, in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\" (book 12, chapter 9, section 2). Based on Josephus' record, Antiochus Eupator began his reign after his father's death (Antiochus Epiphanes) in \"anno\" 149 of the Seleucid Era (= 162 BCE). Twenty-three years into Antiochus Eupator's reign would have then been \"anno\" 172 of the Seleucid Era, or what was then 139 BCE. Since, according to the Scroll of Antiochus, the Second Temple had already been standing 213 years, this means that the Second Temple was completed in \"anno\" 352 BCE, being what was then the 6th year of the reign of Darius the king (i.e. Darius, the son of Hystaspes), the year in which the king finished its building according to Ezra 6:15. Although this date of the Temple's rebuilding largely disagrees with modern scholarship who base their chronologies upon the Babylonian Chronicles and its rebuilding in 516 BCE, it is, nonetheless, held by religious Jewish circles as being accurate and reliable, since it is founded upon a tradition passed down generation after generation. The Babylonian Chronicles, however, are known to be lacking in certain regnal years ascribed to some kings, besides disagreeing in other places with the ancient Egyptian records outlining the regnal years of eight successive Persian kings, preserved in the Third Book of Manetho. In Jewish tradition, the Second Temple stood 420 years, meaning, it was destroyed by Titus in the 2nd year of the reign of Vespasian, in 68 CE. For a discussion of subject, see Seder Olam Rabbah.\n\nThe 2nd century Jewish chronicler wrote in \"Seder Olam Rabbah\" (chapter 30): \"Rabbi Yose says: The kingdom of Persia during the time of the Temple lasted [only] 34 years.\" Many have misconstrued these words to mean that the author of \"Seder Olam Rabbah\" has contracted the entire Persian period of over 200 years into a supposed period of 34 years. According to RASHI, the 34-year Persian period must be understood in the context of their hegemony over Israel while the Second Temple stood. Meaning, 34 years is the precise timeframe between the building of the Second Temple under Darius (I) in 352 BCE (according to Jewish calculations) and Alexander the Great's rise to power in 318 BCE – collected altogether as 34 years of Persian hegemony over Israel while the Temple stood. This timeframe, therefore, does not signify the end of the dynasties in Persia, but rather of their rule and hegemony over Israel before Alexander the Great rose to power.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "4555383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4555383", "title": "Oxford Calculators", "text": "Oxford Calculators\n\nThe Oxford Calculators were a group of 14th-century thinkers, almost all associated with Merton College, Oxford; for this reason they were dubbed \"The Merton School\". These men took a strikingly logico-mathematical approach to philosophical problems.\nThe key \"calculators\", writing in the second quarter of the 14th century, were Thomas Bradwardine, William Heytesbury, Richard Swineshead and John Dumbleton.\nThese men built on the slightly earlier work of Walter Burley and Gerard of Brussels.\n\nThe advances these men made were initially purely mathematical but later became relevant to mechanics. They used Aristotelian logic and physics. They also studied and attempted to quantify every physical and observable characteristic, like heat, force, color, density, and light. Aristotle believed that only length and motion were able to be quantified. But they used his philosophy and proved it untrue by being able to calculate things such as temperature and power.\nThey developed Al-Battani's work on trigonometry and their most famous work was the development of the mean speed theorem, (though it was later credited to Galileo) which is known as \"The Law of Falling Bodies\". Although they attempted to quantify these observable characteristics, their interests lay more in the philosophical and logical aspects than in natural world. They used numbers to philosophically disagree and prove the reasoning of \"why\" something worked the way it did and not only \"how\" something functioned the way that it did.\n\nThe Oxford Calculators distinguished kinematics from dynamics, emphasizing kinematics, and investigating instantaneous velocity. They first formulated the mean speed theorem: \"a body moving with constant velocity travels the same distance as an accelerated body in the same time if its velocity is half the final speed of the accelerated body\".\n\nThe mathematical physicist and historian of science Clifford Truesdell, wrote:\n\nIn \"Tractatus de proportionibus\" (1328), Bradwardine extended the theory of proportions of Eudoxus to anticipate the concept of exponential growth, later developed by the Bernoulli and Euler, with compound interest as a special case. Arguments for the mean speed theorem (above) require the modern concept of limit, so Bradwardine had to use arguments of his day. Mathematician and mathematical historian Carl Benjamin Boyer writes, \"Bradwardine developed the Boethian theory of double or triple or, more generally, what we would call 'n-tuple' proportion\".\n\nBoyer also writes that \"the works of Bradwardine had contained some fundamentals of trigonometry\". Yet \"Bradwardine and his Oxford colleagues did not quite make the breakthrough to modern science.\" The most essential missing tool was algebra.\n\nThomas Bradwardine was born in 1290 in Sussex, England. An attending student educated at Balliol College, Oxford, he earned various degrees. He was a secular cleric, a scholar, a theologist, a mathematician, and a physicist. He became chancellor of the diocese of London and Dean of St Paul's, as well as chaplain and confessor to Edward III. During his time at Oxford, he authored many books including: \"De Geometria Speculativa\" (printed in Paris, 1530), \"De Arithmetica Practica\" (printed in Paris, 1502), and \"De Proportionibus Velocitatum in Motibus\" (printed in Paris in 1495).\n\nAristotle suggested that velocity was proportional to force and inversely proportional to resistance, doubling the force would double the velocity but doubling the resistance would halve the velocity (VαF/R). Bradwardine objected saying that this is not observed because the velocity does not equal zero when the resistance exceeds the force. Instead, he proposed a new theory that, in modern terms, would be written as (Vαlog F/R), which was widely accepted until the late sixteenth century.\n\nWilliam Heytesbury was a bursar at Merton until the late 1330s and he administered the college properties in Northumberland. Later in his life he was a chancellor of Oxford. He was the first to discover the mean-speed theorem, later \"The Law of Falling Bodies\". Unlike Bradwardine's theory, the theorem, also known as \"The Merton Rule\" is a probable truth.\nHis most noted work was \"Regulae Solvendi Sophismata\" (Rules for Solving Sophisms). \"Sophisma\" is a statement which one can argue to be both true and false. The resolution of these arguments and determination of the real state of affairs forces one to deal with logical matters such as the analysis of the meaning of the statement in question, and the application of logical rules to specific cases. An example would be the statement, \"The compound H2O is both a solid and a liquid\". When the temperature is low enough this statement is true. But it may be argued and proven false at a higher temperature. In his time, this work was logically advanced.\nHe was a second generation calculator. He built on Richard Klivingston's \"Sophistimata and Bradwardine's \"Insolubilia\". Later, his work went on to influence Peter of Mantura and Paul of Venice.\n\nRichard Swineshead was also an English mathematician, logician, and natural philosopher. The sixteenth-century polymath Girolamo Cardano placed him in the top-ten intellects of all time, alongside Archimedes, Aristotle, and Euclid.\nHe became a member of the Oxford calculators in 1344. His main work was a series of treatises written in 1350. This work earned him the title of \"The Calculator\". His treatises were named \"Liber Calculationum\", which means \"Book of Calculations\". His book dealt in exhaustive detail with quantitative physics and he had over fifty variations of Bradwardine's law.\n\nJohn Dumbleton became a member of the calculators in 1338-39.

His publications include \"Image and Logic: A Material Culture of Microphysics\" (1997) and \"Einstein's Clocks, Poincaré's Maps: Empires of Time\". His most recent book (2007), co-authored with Lorraine Daston, is titled \"Objectivity\".\n\nBefore moving to Harvard, Galison taught for several years at Stanford University, where he was professor of history, philosophy, and physics. He is considered part of the Stanford School of philosophy of science along with Ian Hacking, John Dupré, and Nancy Cartwright.\n\nGalison developed a film for the History Channel on the development of the hydrogen bomb, and has done work on the intersection of science with other disciplines, in particular art (along with his wife, Caroline A. Jones) and architecture. He is on the editorial board of \"Critical Inquiry\" and was a MacArthur Fellow in 1996.\n\nIn \"Image and Logic\", Galison explored the fundamental rift rising in the physical sciences: whether singular, visual accounts of scientific phenomena would be accepted as the dominant language of proof, or whether statistically significant, frequently repeated results would dominate the field. This division, Galison claims, can be seen in the conflicts amongst high-energy physicists investigating new particles, some of whom offer up statistically significant and frequently replicated analysis of the new particle passing through electric fields, others of whom offer up a single picture of a particle behaving—in a single instance—in a way that cannot be explained by the characteristics of existing known particles.\n\nHis work with Lorraine Daston developed the concept of mechanical objectivity which is often used in scholarly literature, and he has done pioneering work on applying the anthropological notion of trading zones to scientific practice.\n\nGalison has been involved in the production of three documentary films. The first, \"The Ultimate Weapon: The H-Bomb Dilemma\", was about the political and scientific decisions behind the creation of the first hydrogen bomb in the United States, and premiered on the History Channel in 2000. The second, \"Secrecy\", which Galison directed with Harvard filmmaker Robb Moss, is about the costs and benefits of government secrecy, and premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Also from Harvard, Ruth Lingford worked on the animation for \"Secrecy\". Galison completed his third documentary film \"Containment\", also directed with Robb Moss, in 2015. It premiered at the 2015 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, and has been shown at film festivals around the world including in Brazil, Switzerland, and Australia. This documentary investigates governments' attempts to contain a hundred million gallons of deadly radioactive sludge for 10,000 years: how can people warn future generations across this immense time span during which languages, cultures and the environment will continually transform?\n\n\n\n"}

Several landmarks were named after him or his brother. After the expedition was completed Waldron enjoyed some popularity and influence in Washington, D.C.\n\nBorn March 28, 1803, the oldest son of Daniel Waldron and Olive Huske Sheafe, he would have seen the 1819 bankruptcy of his father, the 1820 loss of the substantial landholdings that his family had possessed continuously since his ancestor Richard Waldron began to acquire Dover, New Hampshire holdings in 1635, and the 1821 death of his father.\n\nBy February 1827 he was \"of Portsmouth\" and he had possession of his ancestor Richard Waldron's papers. In September 1845 he provided Father Sebastien Rale's strongbox, another family heirloom, for safekeeping to the Massachusetts Historical Society.\n\nWaldron was a member of the Wilkes Expedition which in 1840 visited Antarctica. Cape Waldron was named after him.\n\nIn July 1840 the Wilkes Expedition named a small Fijian island after Waldron. This island may be more often referred to by its dual name of Namotu Island.\n\nThis expedition also charted much of the west coast of the then-disputed Washington state coast, including the San Juan Islands of present-day Washington State. In May 1841 one of the islands was named Waldron Island. It is difficult to sort out which Waldron brother lent his name to this island.\n\nThe expedition also visited Hawaii where \"Purser R. R. Waldron and Joseph Drayton ventured inside the crater [ Kilauea Caldera in present day Hawaii Volcanoes National Park] and walked on the dome's hot surface until lava oozed through cracks that formed within fifteen feet of them.\" Waldron Ledge, which overlooks the caldera from the eastern rim, is a popular twenty-minute hike from the park visitor's center where rangers often take groups on short talks.\n\nWaldron also witnessed a treaty between the United States (signed by Wilkes) and the Sultan of Sulu in 1842.\n\nIn the months after the conclusion of the Wilkes Expedition, several of the officers found themselves much in demand in Washington society. \"Chief among the widely traveled sailors being adoringly feted was Richard R. Waldron ...\" \"...[T]he well-connected Richard Waldron ... was scheduled to dine with Secretary of State Daniel Webster at the secretary's home that evening [December 24, 1842].\"\n\nIn December 1842 he was among those credited with assisting the delegation from the Kingdom of Hawaii. They \"received encouragement and support from knowledgeable and experienced naval officers, most notably Charles Wilkes and Richard Waldron, who had traversed the immense reaches of the Pacific Ocean and understood the strategic importance of the Hawaiian Islands... In all, these [and other] insider contacts paved the way for Haalilio and Richards to meet on seven occasions with the reluctant and evasive Secretary Webster. Eventually the Hawaiian delegates also succeeded in having an audience with President Tyler and other members of his cabinet.\n\nWaldron was even linked with Julia Gardiner, future wife of President Tyler. Before that romance flourished, \"it seems Julia and sister Margaret often went dancing and that Julia's date sometimes was naval officer Richard R. Waldron, 23, who had been a member of the Pacific explorations of Wilkes. Julia considered him too \"boyish\". Having passed up Mr. Waldron, Julia Gardiner Tyler became the second wife of President John Tyler a couple of years later, at the age of 24.\n\nHistorian Edward Crapol incorrectly characterizes the then 39-year-old Richard Russell Waldron as a young 23-year-old midshipman in 1842, and Lyle Emerson Nelson follows him in that. It is not known whether Waldron appeared very young for his age, or if his youngest brother Thomas (then 28) was misidentified as him.\n\nWaldron died unmarried on October 30, 1846, four years after the Wilkes Expedition concluded.\n\nCape Waldron in Antarctica, and perhaps two Waldron Islands, one in Fiji and a possible second island in Washington state, are named after him. Waldron Ledge overlooking the Kilauea Caldera in Hawaii is named after him.\n"}

The later historian Pelayo of Oviedo, who continued Sampiro's chronicle down to his own age, replaced this laudatory section with an attack on the king, bequeathing to historiography the nickname by which Vermudo II is always known: \"the Gouty\" (\"el Gotoso\").\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "1424698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1424698", "title": "Steam power during the Industrial Revolution", "text": "Steam power during the Industrial Revolution\n\nImprovements to the steam engine were some of the most important technologies of the Industrial Revolution, although steam did not replace water power in importance in Britain until after the Industrial Revolution. From Englishman Thomas Newcomen's atmospheric engine, of 1712, through major developments by Scottish inventor and mechanical engineer James Watt, the steam engine began to be used in many industrial settings, not just in mining, where the first engines had been used to pump water from deep workings. Early mills had run successfully with water power, but by using a steam engine a factory could be located anywhere, not just close to water. Water power varied with the seasons and was not always available.\n\nIn 1775 Watt formed an engine-building and engineering partnership with manufacturer Matthew Boulton. The partnership of Boulton & Watt became one of the most important businesses of the Industrial Revolution and served as a kind of creative technical centre for much of the British economy. The partners solved technical problems and spread the solutions to other companies. Similar firms did the same thing in other industries and were especially important in the machine tool industry. These interactions between companies were important because they reduced the amount of research time and expense that each business had to spend working with its own resources. The technological advances of the Industrial Revolution happened more quickly because firms often shared information, which they then could use to create new techniques or products.\n\nFrom mines to mills, steam engines found many uses in a variety of industries. The introduction of steam engines improved productivity and technology, and allowed the creation of smaller and better engines. After Richard Trevithick's development of the high-pressure engine, transport-applications became possible, and steam engines found their way into boats, railways, farms and road vehicles. Steam engines are an example of how changes brought by industrialization led to even more changes in other areas.\n\nThe development of the stationary steam engine was a very important early element of the Industrial Revolution. However, it should be remembered that for most of the period of the Industrial Revolution, the majority of industries still relied on wind and water power as well as horse and man-power for driving small machines.\n\nThe industrial use of steam power started with Thomas Savery in 1698. He constructed and patented in London the first engine, which he called the \"Miner's Friend\" since he intended it to pump water from mines. Early versions used a soldered copper boiler which burst easily at low steam pressures. Later versions with iron boiler were capable of raising water about 46 meters (150 feet). The Savery engine had no moving parts other than hand-operated valves. The steam once admitted into the cylinder was first condensed by an external cold water spray, thus creating a partial vacuum which drew water up through a pipe from a lower level; then valves were opened and closed and a fresh charge of steam applied directly on to the surface of the water now in the cylinder, forcing it up an outlet pipe discharging at higher level. The engine was used as a low-lift water pump in a few mines and numerous water works, but it was not a success since it was limited in pumping height and prone to boiler explosions.\n\nThe first practical mechanical steam engine was introduced by Thomas Newcomen in 1712. Newcomen apparently conceived his machine quite independently of Savery, but as the latter had taken out a very wide-ranging patent, Newcomen and his associates were obliged to come to an arrangement with him, marketing the engine until 1733 under a joint patent. Newcomen's engine appears to have been based on Papin's experiments carried out 30 years earlier, and employed a piston and cylinder, one end of which was open to the atmosphere above the piston. Steam just above atmospheric pressure (all that the boiler could stand) was introduced into the lower half of the cylinder beneath the piston during the gravity-induced upstroke; the steam was then condensed by a jet of cold water injected into the steam space to produce a partial vacuum; the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the vacuum on either side of the piston displaced it downwards into the cylinder, raising the opposite end of a rocking beam to which was attached a gang of gravity-actuated reciprocating force pumps housed in the mineshaft. The engine's downward power stroke raised the pump, priming it and preparing the pumping stroke. At first the phases were controlled by hand, but within ten years an escapement mechanism had been devised worked by of a vertical \"plug tree\" suspended from the rocking beam which rendered the engine self-acting.\n\nA number of Newcomen engines were successfully put to use in Britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines, with the engine on the surface; these were large machines, requiring a lot of capital to build, and produced about 5 hp. They were extremely inefficient by modern standards, but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads, opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper. Despite their disadvantages, Newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the nineteenth century. By 1729, when Newcomen died, his engines had spread to France, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Sweden. A total of 110 are known to have been built by 1733 when the joint patent expired, of which 14 were abroad. In the 1770s, the engineer John Smeaton built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements. A total of 1,454 engines had been built by 1800.\n\nA fundamental change in working principles was brought about by James Watt. With the close collaboration of Matthew Boulton, he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably, the use of a steam jacket around the cylinder to keep it at the temperature of the steam and, most importantly, a steam condenser chamber separate from the piston chamber. These improvements increased engine efficiency by a factor of about five, saving 75% on coal costs.\n\nThe Newcomen engine could not, at the time, be easily adapted to drive a rotating wheel, although Wasborough and Pickard did succeed in doing so in about 1780. However, by 1783 the more economical Watt steam engine had been fully developed into a double-acting rotative type with a centrifugal governor, parallel motion and flywheel which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill. Both of Watt's basic engine types were commercially very successful.\n\nBy 1800, the firm Boulton & Watt had constructed 496 engines, with 164 driving reciprocating pumps, 24 serving blast furnaces, and 308 powering mill machinery; most of the engines generated from 5 to 10 hp. An estimate of the total power that could be produced by all these engines was about 11,200 hp. This was still only a small fraction of the total power generating capacity in Britain by waterwheels (120,000 hp) and by windmills (15,000 hp); however, water and wind power were seasonably variable. Newcomen and other steam engines generated at the same time about 24,000 hp.\n\nThe development of machine tools, such as the lathe, planing and shaping machines powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines.\n\nIn the early 19th century after the expiration of the Boulton & Watt patent in 1800, the steam engine underwent great increases in power due to the use of higher pressure steam which Watt had always avoided because of the danger of exploding boilers, which were in a very primitive state of development.\n\nUntil about 1800, the most common pattern of steam engine was the beam engine, built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine-house, but soon various patterns of self-contained portative engines (readily removable, but not on wheels) were developed, such as the table engine. Further decrease in size due to use of higher pressure came towards the end of the 18th Century when the Cornish engineer, Richard Trevithick and the American engineer, Oliver Evans, independently began to construct higher pressure (about ) engines which exhausted into the atmosphere, although Arthur Wolf working at the Meux Brewery in London was already experimenting with higher pressure steam, in his efforts to save coal. This allowed an engine and boiler to be combined into a single unit compact and light enough to be used on mobile road and rail locomotives and steam boats.\n\nTrevithick was a man of versatile talents, and his activities were not confined to small applications. Trevithick developed his large Cornish boiler with an internal flue from about 1812. These were also employed when upgrading a number of Watt pumping engines, by this time Arthur Wolf had already produced high pressure engines whilst working at Meux brewery in London, in his efforts to improve efficiency, thus saving coal, as he had been trained by Joseph Bramah in the art of quality control, which resulted in him becoming chief engineer at Harveys of Hayle in Cornwall, by far the largest and leading manufacturer of steam engines in the world.\n\nThe Cornish engine was developed in the 1810s for pumping mines in Cornwall. It was the result of using the exhaust of a high pressure engine to power a condensing engine. The Cornish engine was notable for its relatively high efficiency.\n\nThe last major improvement to the steam engine was the Corliss engine. Named after its inventor, George Henry Corliss, this stationary steam engine was introduced to the world in 1849. The engine boasted a number of desired features, including fuel efficiency (lowering cost of fuel by a third or more), low maintenance costs, 30% higher rate of power production, high thermal efficiency, and the ability to operate under light, heavy, or varying loads while maintaining high velocity and constant speed. While the engine was loosely based on existing steam engines keeping the simple piston-flywheel design, the majority of these features were brought about by the engine’s unique valves and valve gears. Unlike most engines employed during the era that were using mainly slide-valve gears, Corliss created his own system that used a wrist plate to control a number of different valves. Each cylinder was equipped with four valves, with exhaust and inlet valves at both ends of the cylinder. Through a precisely tuned series of events opening and closing these valves, steam is admitted and released at a precise rate allowing for linear piston motion. This provided the engine’s most notable feature, the automatic variable cut-off mechanism. This mechanism is what allowed the engine to maintain a set speed in response to varying loads without losing efficiency, stalling, or being damaged. Using a series of cam gears, which could adjust valve timing (essentially acting as a throttle), the engine’s speed and horsepower was adjusted. This proved extremely useful for most of the engine’s applications. In the textile industry, it allowed for production at much higher speeds while lowering the likelihood that threads would break. In metallurgy, the extreme and abrupt variations of load experienced in rolling mills were also countered by the technology. These examples demonstrate that the Corliss engine was able to lead to much higher rates of production, while preventing costly damages to machinery and materials. It was referred to as “the most perfect regulation of speed.” \n\nCorliss kept a detailed record of the production, collective horsepower, and sales of his engines up until the patent expired. He did this for a number of reasons, including tracking those who infringed on the patent rights, maintenance and upgrade details, and especially as data used to extend the patent. With this data, a more clear understanding of the engine’s influence is provided. By 1869, nearly 1200 engines had been sold, totaling 118,500 horsepower. Another estimated 60,000 horsepower was being utilized by engines that were created by manufacturers infringing on Corliss’s patent, bringing the total horsepower to roughly 180,000. This relatively small number of engines produced 15% of the United States’ total 1.2 million horsepower. The mean horsepower for all Corliss engines in 1870 was 100, while the mean for all steam engines (including Corliss engines) was 30. Some very large engines even allowed for applications as large as 1,400 horsepower. Many were convinced of the Corliss engine’s benefits, but adoption was slow due to patent protection. When Corliss was denied a patent extension in 1870, it became a prevalent model for stationary engines in the industrial sector. By the end of the 19th century, the engine was already having a major influence on the manufacturing sector, where it made up only 10% of the sector’s engines, but produced 46% of the horsepower. The engine also became a model of efficiency outside of the textile industry as it was used for pumping the waterways of Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1878 and by playing an essential role in the expansion of the railroad by allowing for very large-scale operations in rolling mills.\nMany steam engines of the 19th century have been replaced, destroyed, or repurposed, but the longevity of the Corliss engine is apparent today in select distilleries where they are still used as a power source.\n\nIn the mid 1750s the steam engine was applied to the water power-constrained iron, copper and lead industries for powering blast bellows. These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping. Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768. Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed. (Lime rich slag was not free-flowing at the previously used temperatures.) With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron. Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel. As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century.\n\nWater power, the world's preceding supply of power, continued to be an essential power source even during the height of steam engine popularity. The steam engine, however, provided many benefits that couldn’t be realized by relying solely on water power, allowing it to quickly become industrialised nations' dominant power source (rising from 5% to 80% of the total power in the US from 1838-1860). While many consider the potential for an increase in power generated to be the dominant benefit (with the average horsepower of steam powered mills producing four times the power of water powered mills), others favor the potential for agglomeration. Steam engines made it possible to easily work, produce, market, specialize, viably expand westward without having to worry about the less abundant presence of waterways, and live in communities that weren’t geographically isolated in proximity to rivers and streams. Cities and towns were now built around factories where steam engines served as the foundation for the livelihood of many of the citizens. By promoting the agglomeration of individuals, local markets were established and often met with impressive success, cities quickly grew and were eventually urbanized, the quality of living increased as infrastructure was put in place, finer goods could be produced as acquisition of materials became less difficult and expensive, direct local competition led to higher degrees of specialization, and labor and capital were in rich supply. In some counties where the establishments utilized steam power, population growths were even seen to increase. These steam powered towns encouraged growth locally and on the national scale, further validating the economic importance of the steam engine.\n\nThis period of economic growth, which was ushered in by the introduction and adoption of the steamboat, was one of the greatest ever experienced in the United States. Around 1815, steamboats began to replace barges and flatboats in the transport of goods around the United States. Prior to the steamboat, rivers were generally only used in transporting goods from east to west, and from north to south as fighting the current was very difficult and often impossible. Non-powered boats and rafts were assembled up-stream, would carry their cargo down stream, and would often be disassembled at the end of their journey; with their remains being used to construct homes and commercial buildings. \n\nFollowing the advent of the steamboat, the United States saw an incredible growth in the transportation of goods and people, which was key in westward expansion. Prior to the steamboat, it could take between three and four months to make the passage from New Orleans to Louisville, averaging twenty miles a day. With the steamboat this time was reduced drastically with trips ranging from twenty-five to thirty-five days. This was especially beneficial to farmers as their crops could now be transported elsewhere to be sold. \nThe steamboat also allowed for increased specialization. Sugar and Cotton were shipped up north while goods like poultry, grain and pork were shipped south. Unfortunately, the steamboat also aided in the internal slave trade.\nWith the steamboat came the need for an improved river system. The natural river system had features that either wasn't compatible with steamboat travel or was only available during certain months when rivers were higher. Some obstacles included rapids, sand bars, shallow waters and waterfalls. To overcome these natural obstacles, a network of canals, locks and dams were constructed. This increased demand for labor spurred tremendous job growth along the rivers.\n\nThe economic benefits of the steamboat extended far beyond the construction of the ships themselves, and the goods they transported. These ships led directly to growth in the coal and insurance industries, along with creating demand for repair facilities along the rivers. Additionally the demand for goods in general increased as the steamboat made transport to new destinations both wide reaching and efficient.\n\nAfter the first steamboat was invented and achieved a number of successful trials, it was quickly adopted and led to an even quicker change in the way of water transport. \nIn 1814, the city of New Orleans recorded 21 steamboat arrivals, but over the course of the following 20 years that number exploded to more than 1200. The steamboat’s role as a major transportation source was secured. \nThe transport sector saw enormous growth following the steam engine's application, leading to major innovations in canals, steamboats, and railroads. The steamboat and canal system revolutionized trade of the United States. As the steamboats gained popularity, enthusiasm grew for the building of canals. \nIn 1816, the US had only 100 miles of canals. This needed to change, however, as the potential increase in traded goods from east to west convinced many that canals were a necessary connection between the Mississippi-Ohio waterways with the Great Lakes.\n\nThe use of steam engines on railroads proved to be extraordinary in the fact that now you could have large amounts of goods and raw materials delivered to cities and factories alike. Trains could deliver these to places far away at a fraction of the cost traveling by wagon. Railroad tracks, which were already in use in mines and various other situations, became the new means of transportation after the first locomotive was invented.\n\n"}

{"id": "975696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=975696", "title": "Thomas Keightley", "text": "Thomas Keightley\n\nThomas Keightley (17 October 1789 – 4 November 1872) was an Irish writer known for his works on mythology and folklore, particularly \"Fairy Mythology\" (1828), reprinted as \"The World Guide to Gnomes, Fairies, Elves, and Other Little People\" (1880, 1978, 2000, etc.). Regarded as a pioneer in the study of Folklore by modern scholars in the field, he was one of the \"early and important comparativist collectors\" of folklore. A circumspect scholar, he did not deem that similar tales recognizable across countries automatically signified transmission, but allowed that similar tales could arise independently in different cultures.\n\nAt the request of the educator Thomas Arnold, he authored a series of textbooks on English, Greek, and other histories, which were adopted at Arnold's Rugby School as well as other public schools.\n\nKeightley, born in October 1789, was the son of Thomas Keightley of Newtown, co. Kildare, and claimed to be related to Thomas Keightley (1650?–1719). He entered Trinity College, Dublin, on 4 July 1803, but left without a degree, and due to poor health he was forced to abandon the pursuit of the legal profession and admission to the Irish Bar.\n\nIn 1824 he settled in London, and engaged in literary and journalistic work. Keightley is known to have contributed tales to Thomas Crofton Croker's \"Fairy Legends of South Ireland\" (1825), though not properly acknowledged. It turned out that he submitted at least one tale (\"The Soul Cages\") almost entirely of his own fabrication unbeknown to Croker and others.\n\nHaving spent time in Italy, he was capable of producing translations of tales from \"Pentamerone\" or \"The Nights of Straparola\" in \"Fairy Mythology\", and he struck up a friendship with the patriarch of the Rossetti household. Thomas claimed to be literate in twenty-odd languages and dialects in all, and published a number of translations and digests of medieval and foreign works and passages, often sparsely treated elsewhere in the English language, including the expanded prose versions of \"Ogier the Dane\" which conveys the hero to Morgan le Fay's Fairyland, or Swedish ballads on nixes and elves, such as \"Harpans kraft\" (\"Power of the Harp\") and \"\" (\"Sir Olof in Elve-Dance\").\n\nIn 1828 Keightley published \"Fairy Mythology,\" 2 vols., illustrated by W. H. Brooke. A German translation by \"Mythologie der feen und elfen\" (1828) quickly appeared. Jacob Grimm is said to have praised the work. It was popular among Victorian folklore researchers and literary figures in its day; an expanded edition appeared in 1850, and a newly prefaced one in 1860. It has subsequently been reissued intermittently up to modern times, to an extent vindicating Keightley's own \"high hopes of immortality for his work\" in his preface, despite an early biographer calling this \"pretentious\".\n\nKeightley is regarded as an early practitioner in England of the Brothers Grimm's approach to the study of myth and folklore, exploring the parallels between the myth of a nation to the religions and mythology of other regions. Thus Keightley began by attempting to trace fairy myth to Gothic and Teutonic roots, as the Grimms had done for elves. Keightley, like the Grimms, eventually reached the conclusion that it was implausible to trace a myth to an ultimate single source, and that parallel myths can be explained by the \"Enlightenment idea that human nature [that] is uniform,\" and similar experiences and responses are shared across mankind.\n\nA selection in \"Fairy Mythology\" was an Irish mermaid story entitled \"The Soul Cages,\" which turned out to be a hoax of sorts. The male merrow story was first printed in Croker's anthology, but Keightley came out with a later edition of the \"Fairy Mythology\" he added a footnote to this tale, proclaiming he \"must here make an honest confession,\" and informed the reader that except for the kernel of the story adapted from the German story of \"The Peasant and the Waterman\", this Irish tale was entirely his invention.\n\nKeightley's bowdlerized \"The Mythology of Ancient Greece and Italy for the Use of School\" (1831) was applauded by Thirlwall for making the subject \"fit for ladies.\" In it, Cronus's use of the adamant sickle (\"harpē\") to emasculate his father has been euphemized as an act of Uranus being \"mutilated.\" It has been noted that Keightley took a more historico-scientific, as opposed to theological approach to Greek mythology.\n\nKeightley's \"Tales and Popular Fictions; their Resemblances and Transmissions from Country to Country,\" appeared in 1834. He divided the book into three parts, tales which he believed were transmitted to Europe from the Middle East, tale groups demonstrating striking similarity but which he thought were independently conceived, and those which confounded him.\n\nKeightley was long occupied in compiling historical manuals for instructional use and popular enlightenment. His \"Outlines of History\" was one of the early volumes of Lardner's \"Cabinet Cyclopædia\" (1829). His \"History of the War of Greek Independence\" (1830) forms volumes lx. and lxi. of \"Constable's Miscellany.\"\n\nAfter the \"Outlines,\" Keightley was urged by the educator Thomas Arnold of Rugby School to undertake work on a series of mid-sized histories to be used in schools. \"History of England\" (1837–39), 2 vols., although based on John Lingard, was intended to counteract that writer's catholic tendencies. Other textbooks followed: \"History of Greece\" (1835); Rome (1836); Roman Empire (1840); India in (1846–7). His \"History of Greece\" was translated into modern Greek. Keightley also compiled as a study tool \"Questions on Keightley's History of Greece\" and Rome (1836), and one on English history (1840) consisted of a long list of history quizzes organized by chapter, for young students of his Roman, Greek, and histories.\n\nKeightley stated he sought to create history material for the schoolroom which were an improvement on Oliver Goldsmith's \"History\", thought himself equal to the task, and found his proof when his titles were \"adopt(ed).. immediately on their appearance\" by \"Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester, and most of the other great public schools, besides a number of private ones.\" In 1850, Keightley wrote immodestly of his historical output as \"yet unrivalled, and may long be unsurpassed.\" Keightley's \"History of Rome\" was derivative of the labors of the German classical historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr, and Keightley's patron or mentor Arnold was a subscriber of Niebuhr's approach.\n\nSamuel Warren, in his \"Legal Studies,\" 3rd ed. 1854 (i. 235–6, 349), highly praises his historical work. But he ludicrously overestimated all his performances, and his claim to have written the best history of Rome in any language, or to be the first to justly value Virgil and Sallust, could not be admitted by his friends. During the last years of his life he received a pension from the civil list. He died at Erith, Kent, on Nov 4, 1872.\n\nBesides the works already mentioned Keightley was author of \"The Crusaders, or Scenes, Events, and Characters from the times of the Crusaders\" (1834). His \"Secret Societies of the Middle Ages\" (\"Library of Entertaining Knowledge\" 1837) was initially published anonymously, and against his wish, and later reprinted in 1848.\n\nKeightley edited Virgil's \"Bucolics and Georgics\" (1847), which was prefigured by his \"Notes on the Bucolics and Georgics of Virgil with Excursus, terms of Husbandry, and a Flora Virgiliana,\" (1846). Other Latin classics he edited were Horace, \"Satires and Epistles\" (1848), Ovid, \"Fasti\" (1848), and Sallust, \"Catilina and Jugurtha\" (1849).\n\nKeightley produced an annotated edition of Milton (2 vols. 1859) as well as his critical biography \"Account of the Life, Opinions, and Writings of John Milton, with an Introduction to Paradise Lost\" (1855). His nuggets of insight have been occasionally invoked, compared, and contradicted in studies into the 20th century and beyond. He is listed among the \"distinguished file\" in one survey of past commentaries on Milton, going back three centuries ().\n\nAppreciation of allusions in Milton's poems require familiarity with classical Greco-Roman mythology and epics; to borrow the words of an American contemporary Thomas Bulfinch: \"Milton abounds in .. allusions\" to classical mythology, and especially \"scattered profusely\" throughout Milton's \"Paradise Lost\". Keightley was one annotator who meticulously tracked Milton's mythological sources. Some of Keightley's flawed commentary have been pointed out. He argued that Milton erred when he spoke of \"Titan, Heaven's first-born,\" there being no single divine being named Titan, only a race of titans. Though that may be so according to the genealogy laid out by Hesiod's \"Theogony\", it has been pointed out that Milton could well have used alternate sources, such as Lactantius's \"Divinae Institutiones\" (\"Divine Institutes\"), which quotes Ennius to the effect that Uranus had two sons, Titan and Saturn.\n\nLikewise regarding Milton's angelology, Keightley had made some correct observations, but he had constrained the source mostly to the Bible, and made mistakes, such as to identify the angel Ithuriel as a coinage.\n\nKeightley also published an unannotated edition of Shakespeare (6 vols. 1864), followed by a study guide entitled \"Shakespeare Expositor: an aid to the perfect understanding of Shakespeare's plays\" (1867).\n\nKeightley is credited with first noticing that Chaucer's Squire's Tale is paralleled by, and hence may have drawn from, the Old French romance, Adenes Le Roi's \"Cléomadès\".\n\nHe also wrote of Henry Fielding's peculiarism of using the antiquated \"hath\" and \"doth\" ( \"Fraser's Magazine\", 1858), without acknowledging a commentator who made the same observation before him.\n\nKeightley, a friend to Gabriele Rossetti, and firm supporter of the latter's views on Dante became one of a handful of non-Italians who socialized with the family in the childhood days of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his siblings. Keightley's \"Fairy Mythology\" was one of the books Dante Gabriel pored over until age ten.\n\nWilliam Michael Rossetti's \"Memoir\" notes that Keightley had as \"his nephew and adopted son, Mr. Alfred Chaworth Lyster\" who became a dear friend. A pen and ink likeness of this nephew by Dante Gabriel Rossetti exists, dated 1855. Writings from the Rossetti family provide some other loose information on Keightley's related kin or on his later private life. A record by William Rossetti of a spiritual séance at Keightley's home at Belvedere on 4 January 1866, amusing in its own right, identifies \"two Misses Keightley\" in attendance, a kinsman named \"William Samuel Keightley\" who died in 1856 supposed to have made his spiritual presence in the session. It has also been remarked that by this period, Keightley had become as \"stone-deaf\" as Seymour Kirkup, a person who was corresponding with Keightley on matters of spiritualism and visions.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1985951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1985951", "title": "Transnationalism", "text": "Transnationalism\n\nTransnationalism is a social phenomenon and scholarly research agenda grown out of the heightened interconnectivity between people and the receding economic and social significance of boundaries among nation states.\n\nThe term \"Trans-National\" was popularized in the early 20th century by writer Randolph Bourne to describe a new way of thinking about relationships between cultures. However, the term itself was coined by a colleague in college. Merriam-Webster Dictionary states 1921 was the year the term \"transnational\" was first used in print, which was after Bourne's death.\n\nTransnationalism as an economic process involves the global reorganization of the production process, in which various stages of the production of any product can occur in various countries, typically with the aim of minimizing costs. Economic transnationalism, commonly known as globalization, was spurred in the latter half of the 20th century by the development of the internet and wireless communication, as well as the reduction in global transportation costs caused by containerization. Multinational corporations could be seen as a form of transnationalism, in that they seek to minimize costs, and hence maximize profits, by organizing their operations in the most efficient means possible irrespective of political boundaries.\n\nProponents of capitalists transnationalism seek to facilitate the flow of people, ideas, and goods among regions. They believe that it has increasing relevance with the rapid growth of capitalist globalization. They contend that it does not make sense to link specific nation-state boundaries with for instance migratory workforces, globalized corporations, global money flow, global information flow, and global scientific cooperation.\n\nHowever, critical theories of transnationalism have argued that transnational capitalism has occurred through the increasing monopolization and centralization of capital by leading dominant groups in the global economy and various power blocs. Scholars critical of global capitalism (and its global ecological and inequality crises) have argued instead for a transnationalism from below between workers and co-operatives as well as popular social and political movements.\n\nTransnationalism as concept, theory and experience has nourished an important literature in social sciences. In practice transnationalism refers to increasing functional integration of processes that cross-borders or according to others trans bordered relations of individuals, groups, firms and to mobilizations beyond state boundaries. Individuals, groups, institutions and states interact with each other in a new global space where cultural and political characteristic of national societies are combined with emerging multilevel and multinational activities. Transnationalism is a part of the process of capitalist globalization. The concept of transnationalism refers to multiple links and interactions linking people and institutions across the borders of nation-states. Although much of the more recent literature has focused on popular protest as a form of transnational activism, some research has also drawn attention to clandestine and criminal networks, as well as foreign fighters, as examples of a wider form of transnationalism.\n\nSome have argued that diasporas, such as the overseas Chinese, are a historical precursor to modern transnationalism. However, unlike some people with transnationalist lives, most diasporas have not been voluntary. The field of diaspora politics does consider modern diasporas as having the potential to be transnational political actors and be influenced by transnational political forces. While the term \"transnationalism\" emphasizes the ways in which nations are no longer able to contain or control the disputes and negotiations through which social groups annex a global dimension to their meaningful practices, the notion of diaspora brings to the fore the racial dynamics underlying the international division of labor and the economic turmoil of global capital. In an article published in 2006, Asale Angel-Ajani claimed that \"there is the possibility within diaspora studies to move away from the politically sanitized discourse that surrounds transnational studies\". Since African diaspora studies have focused on racial formation, racism, and white supremacy, diaspora theory has the potential to bring to transnationalism \"a varied political, if not radical political, perspective to the study of transnational processes and—globalization\".\n\nDifferent approaches have attempted to explain this. Some argue that the main driver of transnationalism has been the development of technologies that have made transportation and communication more accessible and affordable, thus dramatically changing the relationship between people and places. It is now possible for immigrants to maintain closer and more frequent contact with their home societies than ever before.\nHowever, the integration of international migrations to the demographic future of many developed countries is another important driver for transnationalism. Beyond simply filling a demand for low-wage workers, migration also fills the demographic gaps created by declining natural populations in most industrialized countries. Today, migration accounts for 3/5 of population growth on western countries as a whole. And this trend shows no sign of slowing down. \nMoreover, global political transformations and new international legal regimes have weakened the state as the only legitimate source of rights. Decolonization, coupled with the fall of communism and the ascendance of human rights, have forced states to take account of persons qua persons, rather than persons qua citizens. As a result, individuals have rights regardless of their citizenship status within a country.\nOthers, from a neo-marxist approach, argue that transnational class relations have come about which have occurred concomitant with novel organizational and technological advancements and the spread of transnational chains of production and finance.\n\nWhen immigrants engage in transnational activities, they create \"social fields\" that link their original country with their new country or countries of residence. \"We have defined transnationalism as the process by which immigrants build social fields that link together their country of origin and their country of settlement\". These social fields are the product of a series of interconnected and overlapping economic, political, and socio-cultural activities:\n\nEconomic transnational activities such as business investments in home countries and monetary remittances are both pervasive and well documented. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) estimates that in 2006 immigrants living in developed countries sent home the equivalent of $300 billion in remittances, an amount more than double the level of international aid. This intense influx of resources may mean that for some nations development prospects become inextricably linked—if not dependent upon—the economic activities of their respective diasporas.\n\nPolitical transnational activities can range from retained membership in political parties in one’s country of origin and voting in its elections to even running for political office. Less formal but still significant roles include the transfer or dissemination of political ideas and norms, such as publishing an op-ed in a home country newspaper, writing a blog, or lobbying a local elected official. There is also the more extreme example of individuals such as Jesus Galvis, a travel agent in New Jersey who in 1997 ran for a Senate seat in his native Colombia. He was elected and intended to hold office simultaneously in Bogota and Hackensack, New Jersey where he served as a city councilor.\n\nThe rise of global capitalism has occurred through a novel and increasingly functional integration of capitalist chains of production and finance across borders which is tied to the formation of a transnational capitalist class. This approach has led to a broader study of corporate networks, the global working class and the transnationalization of state apparatuses and elites.\n\nTransnationalism is an analytic lens used to understand immigrant and minority populations as a meeting of multiple simultaneous histories. Socio-cultural transnational activities cover a wide array of social and cultural transactions through which ideas and meanings are exchanged. Recent research has established the concept and importance of social remittances which provide a distinct form of social capital between migrants living abroad and those who remain at home. These transfers of socio-cultural meanings and practices occur either during the increased number of visits that immigrants take back to their home countries or visits made by non-migrants to friends and families living in the receiving countries or through the dramatically increased forms of correspondence such as emails, online chat sessions, telephone calls, CDs/ VDOs, and traditional letters.\n\nIn the late 1980s, ethnic studies scholars would largely move towards models of diaspora to understand immigrant communities in relation to area studies, although lone patterns of international flow would become accompanied by the multiple flows of transnationalism. However, to say that immigrants build social fields that link those abroad with those back home is not to say that their lives are not firmly rooted in a particular place and time. Indeed, they are as much residents of their new community as anyone else.\n\nTransnationalism is criticized for being too far removed from ethnic studies' efforts to empower solidarity in minority communities. Asian American Studies provides a counterargument in that its inception was based in comparative analysis of the racial discrimination against Asian Americans and Vietnamese during the Vietnam War.\n\nTransnationalism has significant implications for the way we conceptualize immigration. Traditionally, immigration has been seen as an autonomous process, driven by conditions such as poverty and overpopulation in the country of origin and unrelated to conditions (such as foreign policy and economic needs) in the receiving country. Even though overpopulation, economic stagnation, and poverty all continue to create pressures for migration, they alone are not enough to produce large international migration flows. There are many countries, for example, which lack significant emigration history despite longstanding poverty. Also, most international immigration flows from the global South to the global North are not made up by the poorest of the poor, but, generally by professionals. In addition, there are countries with high levels of job creation that continue to witness emigration on a large scale.\n\nThe reasons and promoters for migration are not only embodied within the country of origin. Instead, they are rooted within the broader geopolitical and global dynamics. Significant evidence of geographic migration patterns suggests that receiving countries become home to immigrants from the receiving country's zone of influence. Then, immigration is but a fundamental component of the process of capitalist expansion, market penetration, and globalization. There are systematic and structural relations between globalization and immigration.\n\nThe emergence of a global economy has contributed both to the creation of potential emigrants abroad and to the formation of economic, cultural, and ideological links between industrialized and developing countries that later serve as bridges for the international migration. For example, the same set of circumstances and processes that have promoted the location of factories and offices abroad have also contributed to the creation of large supply of low-wage jobs for which immigrant workers constitute a desirable labor supply. Moreover, the decline of manufacturing jobs and the growth of the service sector, key drivers of the globalization of production, have transformed western economies’ occupational and income structure.\n\nUnlike the manufacturing sector, which traditionally supplied middle-income jobs and competitive benefits, the majority of service jobs are either extremely well-paid or extremely poorly paid, with relatively few jobs in the middle-income range. Many of the jobs lack key benefits such as health insurance. Sales representatives, restaurant wait staff, administrative assistants, and custodial workers are among the growth occupations.\n\nFinally, the fact that the major growth sectors rather than declining sectors are generating the most low-wage jobs shows that the supply of such jobs will continue to increase for the predictable future. The entry of migrant workers will similarly continue to meet the demand. In turn, this inflow provides the raw material out of which transnational communities emerge.\n\nTransnational organizations include:\n\n\n"}
