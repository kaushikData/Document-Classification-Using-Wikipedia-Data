This city would later become the ruling capital of different Indian kingdoms for about a thousand years. This period saw the rise of two great philosophical schools of the east, Jainism and Buddhism. \nThis period saw Mahavira and Buddha spreading their respective teachings in the northern plains of India. This essentially changed the socio-cultural and political dynamics of the region of South Asia. Buddhism would later go on to become one of the major world religions.\n\nThis period also saw the work of Yaska, who created Nirukta, that would lay the foundation stone for Sanskrit grammar and is one of the oldest works on grammar known to mankind. \nThis century is also traditionally recognized as the classical period of the Greeks, which would continue all the way through the 4th century until the time of Alexander the Great. The life of Socrates represented a major milestone in Greek philosophy though his teachings only survive through the work of his students, most notably Plato and Xenophon. The tragedians Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, as well as the comedian Aristophanes all date from this era and many of their works are still considered classics of the western theatrical canon.\n\nThe Persian Wars, fought between a coalition of Greek cities and the vast Achaemenid Persian Empire was a pivotal moment in Greek politics. After having successfully prevented the annexation of Greece by the Persians, Sparta, the dominant power in the coalition, had no intention of further offensive action and considered the war over. Meanwhile, Athens counter-attacked, liberating Greek subjects of the Persian Empire up and down the Ionian coast and mobilizing a new coalition, the Delian League. Tensions between Athens, and its growing imperialistic ambitions as leader of the Delian League, and the traditionally dominant Sparta led to a protracted stalemate in the Peloponnesian war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee: List of sovereign states in the 5th century BC.\n"}

It works to educate scholars, governments, sport divers, and the public about underwater archaeology and the preservation of underwater cultural heritage. The ACUA is an independent, non-profit organization closely affiliated with the Society for Historical Archaeology (SHA). The ACUA helps the SHA Conference Committee to organize the annual SHA Conference on Historical and Underwater Archaeology and provides continuing education through workshops and panel discussions.\n\nThe ACUA website, blog, and social media platforms provide a forum for discussion and information sharing related to underwater and maritime archaeology to encourage the responsible stewardship, preservation, and protection of underwater and maritime cultural heritage. In 2013 the ACUA was recognized as an NGO by UNESCO. It actively participates in the meetings of the UNESCO Scientific and Technical Advisory Body (STAB) on the promotion of the Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage.\n\nThe Advisory Council on Underwater Archaeology advocates, promotes, and provides advice on responsible public education and stewardship of underwater cultural heritage for present and future generations.\n\nThe ACUA supports the ethical principals of the Society for Historical Archaeology. The ACUA encourages all archaeologists to perform to the highest standards of integrity and professionalism. The organization's Core Principles promote an ethical culture in all activities, in the work place, in the field, and in the classroom to create a climate of trust, respect, and equality. The ACUA provides further guidance on ethical obligations and standards of behavior through its statements on anti-harassment and anti-discrimination.\n\nThe ACUA has been at the forefront of underwater archaeology for nearly 60 years and it the oldest organization of its type. Its genesis as the Council on Underwater Archaeology was in 1959 and its purpose was fully realized at a meeting in 1963 when a group of archaeologists, historians, and sport divers met in St. Paul, Minnesota for the first international Conference on Underwater Archaeology (CUA).\n\nThe first joint conference with the then fledgling Society for Historical Archaeology was held in 1970. By 1973, the present structure and name of the ACUA were established and shortly thereafter the SHA and CUA conferences merged. In 2003, the ACUA and SHA signed a Memorandum of Agreement, formalizing their relationship.\n\nThe ACUA maintains several publications including: \n\nThe ACUA offers a full-day \"Submerged Cultural Resources Awareness Workshop\" annually during the SHA Conference on Historical and Underwater Archaeology. This workshop introduces non-specialists to issues specific to underwater archaeology. Participants learn about different types of underwater cultural heritage (UCH) sites, and the techniques used in Phase I and II equivalent surveys. This workshop does not teach participants to be underwater archaeologists, but introduces different investigative techniques, international Best Practices, and existing legislation. The purpose of this workshop is to assist non-specialists in:\nThe workshop is certified by the Register of Professional Archaeologists and RPA members receive continuing professional education credit.\n\nThe ACUA awards the competitive George Fischer Student Travel Award annually to provide $1,000.00 (USD) in travel support for an international maritime archaeology student to attend and present at the annual Society for Historical and Underwater Archaeology conference.The aware is named after George Fischer, a founding and emeritus member of the ACUA. The award helps to advance board's goal to support the professional development of students embarking on their nascent careers; which furthers the overall mission of the ACUA to foster the growth and development of underwater and maritime archaeology around the globe. Since the inaugural award in 2012, students hailing from the West Indies, Argentina, United Kingdom, and Australia have benefited from the support to participate in the exchange of ideas at the annual conference.\n\nThe ACUA meets regularly as part of the annual SHA Conference on Historical and Underwater Archaeology.\n\nThe ACUA is composed of twelve individuals elected on a rotating basis for four-year terms by the membership of the Society for Historical Archaeology. The members include professionals from state and federal archaeology programs, museums, non-profit institutes, cultural resource management firms, universities, conservation laboratories, and avocational societies involved in underwater archaeology. Members hail from Europe, Canada, Australia, Mexico, South America, the Caribbean, and the United States. The board elects officers for three year terms. All board terms expire at the ACUA business meeting in January.\n\nIn addition to regularly elected members, the ACUA has Associate Members who provide their insights and expertise on technical issues, education, sport diver training, shipwreck preserves and management, and international issues. The associate members may be individuals who are invited because of their particular expertise, or institutions who are invited because of their long and outstanding contributions to the field of underwater archaeology.\n\nGraduate Student Associates extend the council’s outreach to and input from the small but active community of students, who are the future of the field. All associate terms are two years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43143817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43143817", "title": "Anti-revisionism", "text": "Anti-revisionism\n\nAnti-revisionism is a position within Marxism–Leninism which emerged in the 1950s in opposition to the reforms of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Where Khrushchev pursued an interpretation of Leninism that differed from his predecessor Joseph Stalin, the anti-revisionists within the international communist movement remained dedicated to Stalin's ideological legacy and criticized the Soviet Union under Khrushchev and his successors as state capitalist and social imperialist due largely to its hopes of achieving peace with the United States. The term \"Stalinism\" is also used to describe these positions, but it is often not used by its supporters.\n\nMarxism–Leninism is a political ideology based on the theories of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Lenin. It holds that capitalism divides humans into two classes – the bourgeoisie or property-owning class, and the proletariat or labouring class. On top of this, it claims the proletariat is divided into a labour aristocracy of powerful imperialist nations which is granted some economic and political power, and the superexploited colonial or neo-colonial proletariat. Marxist–Leninists advocate the most class conscious members of the proletariat form vanguard parties based around the principle of democratic centralism which will lead revolutionary movements towards the creation of single-party states which will gradually progress to socialism and finally global communism.\n\nAnti-revisionism is a position within Marxism–Leninism based on its interpretation by Joseph Stalin, also called Stalinism. Stalin advocated strict totalitarian rule by vanguard parties, drastic and fast-paced economic transformation in the short-term, and violent confrontation with capitalist powers. The emergence of the Khrushchevist interpretation lead to a reaction from pro-Stalin Marxist–Leninists, who formed the anti-revisionist movement. Anti-revisionists rejected the Soviet Union's leadership of the Marxist–Leninist movement, believing it had become state capitalist and social imperialist. Despite this, the lines between the two camps in Marxism–Leninism were often blurry. The Korean Workers' Party, for instance, was pro-Soviet, but also defended Stalin's legacy and was engaged in violent struggle against the capitalist South Korea and its American backers. Due to this, the global anti-revisionist movement tended to support it and continues to do so to this day despite its ideological departure from Marxism–Leninism. The Cuban Communist Party and Vietnamese Communist Party also received critical support from many anti-revisionists despite being pro-Soviet, due to their violent struggles against the US. The Cuban Communists also provided material support to the American anti-revisionist Black Panther Party.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is officially anti-revisionist; however, most anti-revisionists followed the example of the Albanian Labour Party in denouncing it as revisionist following the beginning of market-based and pro-American reforms in the 1970s. The term \"Dengism\" is often used to describe this perceived revisionist tendency in Marxism–Leninism, despite official claims that it is an adaptation of Marxism–Leninism to contemporary Chinese material conditions, rather than a revision.\n\nDespite agreeing that he had a revisionist turn later in his life, most contemporary anti-revisionists hold particular interest in the theories of Chinese leader Mao Zedong. Mao, amongst other things, claimed that socialist movements in the neo-colonial world could temporarily ally with the nationalist movements of the local petite bourgeoisie, and that the implementation of a \"mass line\" policy will prevent a vanguard from becoming revisionist. Departing from anti-revisionist Marxism–Leninism, many today instead believe in a separate ideology known as Marxism–Leninism–Maoism, which views the early theories of Mao as a higher stage of Leninist ideology, just as Leninism is a higher stage of Marxism. Among both Marxist–Leninist–Maoists and anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninists with a tendency towards Mao's theories exists the Maoist (Third Worldist) tendency which claims the labour aristocracy has no immediate revolutionary potential, and may also claim it experiences no exploitation at all.\n\nSelf-proclaimed anti-revisionists firmly oppose the reforms initiated in Communist countries by leaders like Nikita Khrushchev in the Soviet Union and Deng Xiaoping in China. They generally refer to such reforms and states as state capitalist and social imperialist. They also reject Trotskyism and its \"Permanent Revolution\" as \"hypocritical\" by arguing that Leon Trotsky had at one time thought it acceptable that socialism could work in a single country as long as that country was industrialized, but that Trotsky had considered Russia too backward to achieve such industrialization – what it later in fact did achieve, mostly through his archenemy Joseph Stalin's Five Year Plans.\n\nIn their own right, anti-revisionists also acknowledge that the Soviet Union contained a \"new class\" or \"'red' bourgeoisie\", but they generally place the blame for the formation of that class on Khrushchev and his successors, and not on Stalin. Therefore, in anti-revisionist circles, there is very little talk of class conflict in the Soviet Union before 1956, except when talking about specific contexts such as the Russian Civil War (when some agents of the former feudal ruling class tried to retake state power from the Bolsheviks) and World War II (fought principally between communists and fascists, representing the interests of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie respectively).\n\nDuring the Sino-Soviet split, the governments of the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong and the People's Republic of Albania under Enver Hoxha proclaimed themselves to be taking an anti-revisionist line and denounced Khrushchev's policies in the Soviet Union. In the United States, those who supported China or Albania at the time were expelled from the United States Communist Party under orders from Moscow, and in 1961 they formed the Progressive Labor Movement and other \"new communist movement\" communist parties. A short time later, anti-revisionist groups were further divided by the Sino-Albanian split, with those following Albania being loosely described as Hoxhaist.\n\nOn the whole, the original 1960s-era anti-revisionists tended to take a careful, selective approach to the Cuban Revolution and the way it soon aligned itself with Soviet ideas and practice, criticizing the latter action, while simultaneously acknowledging some aspects of Cuban self-described socialism as genuinely revolutionary—in particular the writing and thinking of Che Guevara. Anti-revisionists also took a hopeful approach towards the Vietnamese communists, expressing confidence that they too were genuinely revolutionary-communist in their aspirations, and supported their struggle against the United States in the Vietnam War—a side which got a lot of support from the Soviet Union, anti-revisionists' \"state capitalist\" enemy.\n\nSeveral present-day communist parties worldwide still see themselves as explicitly anti-revisionist, but not every such party adhering to elements of anti-revisionism necessarily adopts the label \"anti-revisionist\". Many such organizations may call themselves Maoist, Marxist–Leninist or even just simply \"revolutionary communist\".\n\nThe Workers Party of Korea still claims an anti-revisionist political line, but the communist movement as a whole and anti-revisionists from the Maoist and Hoxhaist camps in particular tend to insist North Korea is a revisionist state. However, many if not most Hoxhaists and Maoists are critically supportive of North Korea on grounds of Anti-imperialism.\n\nAnti-revisionists aligned with Enver Hoxha and the line of the Albanian party of labor argue that \"Mao Zedong thought\" is itself a form of revisionism. Hoxhaists insist that Mao's Three Worlds Theory contradicted Marxism–Leninism and existed only to justify Mao's alliance with the United States that began in the early 1970s and his meeting with Nixon during the Sino-Soviet split that Enver Hoxha and the Hoxhaists opposed. Hoxhaists also argue that the theory of New Democracy and People's War were revisionist and anti-scientific. The Hoxhaist camp came into existence during the Sino-Albanian split.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "316723", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316723", "title": "Archive", "text": "Archive\n\nAn archive is an accumulation of historical records or the physical place they are located. Archives contain primary source documents that have accumulated over the course of an individual or organization's lifetime, and are kept to show the function of that person or organization. Professional archivists and historians generally understand archives to be records that have been naturally and necessarily generated as a product of regular legal, commercial, administrative, or social activities. They have been metaphorically defined as \"the secretions of an organism\", and are distinguished from documents that have been consciously written or created to communicate a particular message to posterity. \n\nIn general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archival records are normally unpublished and almost always unique, unlike books or magazines for which many identical copies exist. This means that archives are quite distinct from libraries with regard to their functions and organization, although archival collections can often be found within library buildings.\n\nA person who works in archives is called an archivist. The study and practice of organizing, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives is called archival science. The physical place of storage can be referred to as an archive (more usual in the United Kingdom), an archives (more usual in the United States), or a repository.\n\nWhen referring to historical records or the places they are kept, the plural form \"archives\" is chiefly used. The computing use of the term 'archive' should not be confused with the record-keeping meaning of the term.\n\nFirst attested in English in early 17th century, the word \"archive\" is derived from the French \"archives\" (plural), in turn from Latin \"archīum\" or \"archīvum\", which is the romanized form of the Greek \"ἀρχεῖον\" (\"archeion\"), \"public records, town-hall, residence, or office of chief magistrates\", itself from \"ἀρχή\" (\"arkhē\"), amongst others \"magistracy, office, government\" (compare an-archy, mon-archy), which comes from the verb \"ἄρχω\" (\"arkhō\"), \"to begin, rule, govern\".\n\nThe word originally developed from the Greek \"\" (arkheion), which refers to the home or dwelling of the Archon, in which important official state documents were filed and interpreted under the authority of the Archon. The adjective formed from \"archive\" is \"archival\".\n\nThe practice of keeping official documents is very old. Archaeologists have discovered archives of hundreds (and sometime thousands) of clay tablets going back to the third and second millennia BC in sites like Ebla, Mari, Amarna, Hattusas, Ugarit, and Pylos. These discoveries have been fundamental to know ancient alphabets, languages, literature, and politics.\n\nArchives were well developed by the ancient Chinese, the ancient Greeks, and ancient Romans (who called them \"Tabularia\"). However, they have been lost, since documents written on materials like papyrus and paper deteriorated at a faster pace, unlike their stone tablet counterparts. Archives of churches, kingdoms, and cities from the Middle Ages survive and have often kept their official status uninterruptedly until now. They are the basic tool for historical research on these ages.\n\nModern archival thinking has many roots from the French Revolution. The French National Archives, who possess perhaps the largest archival collection in the world, with records going as far back as 625 A.D., were created in 1790 during the French Revolution from various government, religious, and private archives seized by the revolutionaries.\n\nHistorians, genealogists, lawyers, demographers, filmmakers, and others conduct research at archives. The research process at each archive is unique, and depends upon the institution that houses the archive. While there are many kinds of archives, the most recent census of archivists in the United States identifies five major types: academic, business (for profit), government, non-profit, and other. There are also four main areas of inquiry involved with archives: material technologies, organizing principles, geographic locations, and tangled embodiments of humans and non-humans. These areas help to further categorize what kind of archive is being created.\n\nArchives in colleges, universities, and other educational facilities are typically housed within a library, and duties may be carried out by an archivist. Academic archives exist to preserve institutional history and serve the academic community. An academic archive may contain materials such as the institution's administrative records, personal and professional papers of former professors and presidents, memorabilia related to school organizations and activities, and items the academic library wishes to remain in a closed-stack setting, such as rare books or thesis copies. Access to the collections in these archives is usually by prior appointment only; some have posted hours for making inquiries. Users of academic archives can be undergraduates, graduate students, faculty and staff, scholarly researchers, and the general public. Many academic archives work closely with alumni relations departments or other campus institutions to help raise funds for their library or school. Qualifications for employment may vary. Entry-level positions usually require an undergraduate diploma, but typically archivists hold graduate degrees in history or library science (preferably certified by a body such as the American Library Association). Subject-area specialization becomes more common in higher ranking positions.\n\nArchives located in for-profit institutions are usually those owned by a private business. Examples of prominent business archives in the United States include Coca-Cola (which also owns the separate museum World of Coca-Cola), Procter and Gamble, Motorola Heritage Services and Archives, and Levi Strauss & Co. These corporate archives maintain historic documents and items related to the history and administration of their companies. Business archives serve the purpose of helping their corporations maintain control over their brand by retaining memories of the company's past. Especially in business archives, records management is separate from the historic aspect of archives. Workers in these types of archives may have any combination of training and degrees, from either a history or library background. These archives are typically not open to the public and only used by workers of the owner company, though some allow approved visitors by appointment. Business archives are concerned with maintaining the integrity of their company, and are therefore selective of how their materials may be used.\n\nGovernment archives include those maintained by local and state government as well as those maintained by the national (or federal) government. Anyone may use a government archive, and frequent users include reporters, genealogists, writers, historians, students, and people seeking information on the history of their home or region. Many government archives are open to the public and no appointment is required to visit.\n\nIn the United States, National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) maintains central archival facilities in the District of Columbia and College Park, Maryland, with regional facilities distributed throughout the United States. Some city or local governments may have repositories, but their organization and accessibility varies widely. Similar to the library profession, certification requirements and education also varies widely, from state to state. Professional associations themselves encourage the need to professionalize. NARA offers the Certificate of Federal Records Management Training Program for professional development. The majority of state and local archives staff hold a bachelor's degree—increasingly repositories list advanced degrees (e.g. MA, MLS/MLIS, PhD) and certifications as a position requirement or preference.\n\nIn the UK, the National Archives (formerly known as the Public Record Office) is the government archive for England and Wales. The English Heritage Archive is the public archive of English Heritage. The National Archives of Scotland, located in Edinburgh, serve that country while the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland in Belfast is the government archive for Northern Ireland.\n\nA network of county record offices and other local authority-run archives exists throughout England, Wales, and Scotland and holds many important collections, including local government, landed estates, church, and business records. Many archives have contributed catalogues to the national \"Access to Archives\" programme and online searching across collections is possible.\n\nIn France, the French Archives Administration (\"Service interministériel des Archives de France\") in the Ministry of Culture manages the National Archives (\"Archives nationales\"), which possess 406 km. (252 miles) of archives (the total length of occupied shelves put next to each other), with original records going as far back as A.D. 625, as well as the departmental archives (\"archives départementales\"), located in the \"préfectures\" of each of the 100 \"départements\" of France, which possess 2,297 km. (1,427 miles) of archives (), and also the local city archives, about 600 in total, which possess 456 km. (283,4 miles) of archives (). Put together, the total volume of archives under the supervision of the French Archives Administration is the largest in the world.\n\nIn India, the National Archives (NAI) are located in New Delhi.\n\nIn Taiwan, the National Archives Administration are located in Taipei.\n\nMost intergovernmental organisations keep their own historical archives. However, a number of European organisations, including the European Commission, choose to deposit their archives with the European University Institute in Florence.\n\nA prominent Church Archives is the Vatican Secret Archive.\nArchdioceses, dioceses, and parishes also have archives in the Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches. Very important are monastery archives, because of their antiquity, like the ones of Monte Cassino, Saint Gall, and Fulda. The records in these archives include manuscripts, papal records, local Church records, photographs, oral histories, audiovisual materials, and architectural drawings.\n\nMost Protestant denominations have archives as well, including the Presbyterian U.S.A Historical Society, The Moravian Church Archives, The Southern Baptist Historical Library and Archives, the United Methodist Archives and History Center of the United Methodist Church, and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).\n\nNon-profit archives include those in historical societies, not-for-profit businesses such as hospitals, and the repositories within foundations. Non-profit archives are typically set up with private funds from donors to preserve the papers and history of specific persons or places. Often these institutions rely on grant funding from the government as well as the private funds. Depending on the funds available, non-profit archives may be as small as the historical society in a rural town to as big as a state historical society that rivals a government archives. Users of this type of archive may vary as much as the institutions that hold them. Employees of non-profit archives may be professional archivists, para-professionals, or volunteers, as the education required for a position at a non-profit archive varies with the demands of the collection's user base.\n\nWeb archiving is the process of collecting portions of the World Wide Web and ensuring the collection is preserved in an archive, such as an archive site, for future researchers, historians, and the public. Due to the massive size of the Web, web archivists typically employ web crawlers for automated collection.\n\nSimilarly, software code and documentation can be archived on the web, as with the example of CPAN.\n\nSome archives defy categorization. There are tribal archives within the Native American nations in North America, and there are archives that exist within the papers of private individuals. Many museums keep archives in order to prove the provenance of their pieces. Any institution or persons wishing to keep their significant papers in an organized fashion that employs the most basic principles of archival science may have an archive. In the 2004 census of archivists taken in the United States, 2.7% of archivists were employed in institutions that defied categorization. This was a separate figure from the 1.3% that identified themselves as self-employed.\n\nAnother type of archive is the Public Secrets project. This is an interactive testimonial, in which women incarcerated in the California State Prison System describe what happened to them. The archive's mission is to gather stories from women who want to express themselves, and want their stories heard. This collection includes transcripts and an audio recording of the women telling their stories.\n\nThe archives of an individual may include letters, papers, photographs, computer files, scrapbooks, financial records, or diaries created or collected by the individual – regardless of media or format. The archives of an organization (such as a corporation or government) tend to contain other types of records, such as administrative files, business records, memos, official correspondence, and meeting minutes.\n\nThe International Council on Archives (ICA) has developed a number of standards on archival description including the General International Standard Archival Description ISAD(G). ISAD(G) is meant to be used in conjunction with national standards or as a basis for nations to build their own standards. In the United States, ISAD(G) is implemented through , popularly known as \"DACS\". In Canada, ISAD(G) is implemented through the Council of Archives as the Rules for Archival Description, also known as \"RAD\".\n\nISO is currently working on standards.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5623486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5623486", "title": "Asiatic mode of production", "text": "Asiatic mode of production\n\nThe theory of the Asiatic mode of production (AMP) was devised by Karl Marx around the early 1850s. The essence of the theory has been described as \"[the] suggestion ... that Asiatic societies were held in thrall by a despotic ruling clique, residing in central cities and directly expropriating surplus from largely autarkic and generally undifferentiated village communities\".\n\nThe theory continues to arouse heated discussion among contemporary Marxists and non-Marxists alike. Some have rejected the whole concept on the grounds that the socio-economic formations of pre-capitalist Asia did not differ enough from those of feudal Europe to warrant special designation.\nAside from Marx, Friedrich Engels was also an enthusiastic commentator on the AMP. They both focused on the socio-economic base of AMP society.\n\nMarx's theory focuses on the organization of labour and depends on his distinction between the following:\n\n\nTogether these compose modes of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct predominant modes of production (Asiatic).\nMarx and Engels highlighted and emphasised that the role the state played in Asiatic societies was dominant, which was accounted for by either the state's monopoly of land ownership, its sheer political and military power, or its control over irrigation systems.\nMarx and Engels attributed this state domination to the communal nature of landholding and the isolation of the inhabitants of different villages from one another.\n\nThe Asiatic mode of production is a notion that has been the subject of much discussion by both Marxist and non-Marxist commentators. The AMP is the most disputed mode of production outlined in the works of Marx and Engels.\nQuestions regarding the validity of the concept of the AMP were raised in terms of whether or not it corresponds to the reality of certain given societies.\nHistorians have questioned the value of the notion of the AMP as an interpretation of the \"facts\" of Indian or Chinese history.\n\nThe acceptance of the AMP concept has varied with changes in the political environment. The theory was rejected in the Soviet Union in the Stalinist period. Karl August Wittfogel suggested in his 1957 book, \"Oriental Despotism\", that his concept of Oriental despotism showed that this was because of the similarity between the AMP and the reality of Stalin's Russia, he saw the authoritarian nature of communism as an extension of the need of totalitarian rule to control water in \"the Orient\".\n\n"}
{"id": "30254930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30254930", "title": "Chinese crime fiction", "text": "Chinese crime fiction\n\nChinese crime fiction (Chinese: 犯罪小说, pinyin: \"fànzuì xiǎoshuō\") is an umbrella term which generally refers to Sinophone literature concerned with the investigation and punishment of criminal acts. In mainland China the most popular subgenre is \"detective fiction\" (Chinese: 侦探推理小说， pinyin: \"zhēntàn tuīlǐ xiǎoshuō\", literally \"detective deduction stories\", often abbreviated to 推理小说 tuīlǐ xiǎoshuō or 侦探小说 zhēntàn xiǎoshuō).\n\nIn the 1950s, crime fiction was dominated by \"legal system literature\", which included legal system poetry, crime reportage, and works about civil conflicts. The 1980s saw the rise of the less progressive-sounding public security literature, which marked a shift from the ancient and respected \"court case literature.\"\n\nFrom 1896, Sherlock Holmes was translated into Chinese. During the 1890s-1920s, European-style detective fiction was popular in China.\n\nBetween 1949 and 1977, no work of fiction told of crimes committed by the gentry. Crimes were also not reported by the press as the socialist system was not supposed to foster crime. Sherlockian novels were then characterized as capitalist and low grade, arguing they aroused base passions for sex and violence.\n\nDuring the Song and Ming dynasties, crime fictions varied in themes. Gong'an (crime-case) fiction and swindler stories were considered the most popular subgenres. Written in colloquial rather than literary Chinese, they nearly always featured district magistrates or judges in the higher courts.\n\nThe gong'an genre was among the new types of vernacular fiction that developed from the Song to the Ming Dynasties. The plots usually begin with a description of the crime (often including realistic detail of contemporary life) and culminated in the exposure of the deed and the punishment of the guilty. Sometimes two solutions to a mystery were posited, but the correct solution is reached through a brilliant judge.\n\nIn the Song Dynasty the growth of commerce and urban society created a demand for a new kind of crime fiction–namely gong'an fiction that focused on entertaining the upper and merchant class. One of the most celebrated heroes of such tales was Judge Bao Zheng, or \"Dragon Plan Bao,\" who was originally based on a historical government official. Featured in hundreds of stories, Bao became the archetype of the incorruptible official in a society in which miscarriages of justice in favour of the rich and powerful were all too common. Not all crime stories have happy endings, and some were evidently written with the aim of exposing the brutal methods of corrupt judges who–after accepting bribes–would extract false confessions by torture and condemned innocent people to death. In some tales, the crimes are also exposed with the aid of supernatural forces.\n\nIn the Ming dynasty, the social influence of the merchant class steadily increased as a result of the development of capitalism. As a result of their change of social status, the merchant class demanded more literary entertainment, thus crime fiction featuring merchants as main characters thrived. These stories particularly focused on the way merchants handled money.\n\nOne of the subgenres that developed during the time was swindler stories. Swindler stories focused on elaborate deception for monetary gain. The most famous swindler stories collection is \"The Book of Swindles\" by Zhang Yingyu finished in Late Ming. The book is composited with 24 sub-categories of swindles, which covered merely all kinds of deception in Ming society. Zhang wrote the book for a manual of self-protection as well as an expert guide to the art of deception.\n\nThis was the Golden Age of the Chinese detective story. This era was flooded with translations of Western works as well as native Chinese series detectives.\n\nShort story writer Cheng Xiaoqing (程小青 ) was the most successful and prolific author of original Chinese crime fiction during the Republican Era in mainland China. His stories are noted for their similarity to the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, with an selected stories being having been published by the University of Hawai'i Press under the title \"Sherlock in Shanghai\" in 2007, translated by Timothy C. Wong.\n\nCheng Xiaoqing's contemporary, Sun Liaohong also created a series of Chinese detective novels which are said to have been modeled on the Arsène Lupin stories.\n\nIn the Mao era (1949–1977) of the People's Republic of China, literature involving detective or paranormal elements was banned, but many crime fiction novels written after this time were based within this time period. Stories of crime and detection were characterized as foreign to China.\n\nThe novel, \"Beijing Coma\" by Ma Jian, is banned due to mentions of the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 and time travelling.\n\nHe Jiahong (何家弘) was born in 1953 and is a professor of criminal law at Renmin University and was the part-time Deputy Director of the Department of Dereliction of Duty and Infringement of Human Rights in the Supreme People's Procuratorate from 2006 to 2008. His true crime novel \"Hanging Devils\" was published in English translation in 2012.\n\n阿乙 , born in 1976, is a former police officer who writes darkly realistic crime fiction about migrant workers and the lower strata of mainland Chinese society. His published works include \"Gray Stories\" (灰故事), \"Bird Saw Me\" (鸟看见我了), and \"Cat and Mouse\" (猫和老鼠).\n\nBorn in 1986, Sun Yisheng, who writes post-modern crime fiction under the pen name William Edward, is one of youngest crime writers to have been published in mainland China. He has had at least two short stories translated into English, the first in \"Chutzpah!\" magazine and the second, entitled \"The Shades who Periscope Through Flowers to the Sky\", in the online literary journal Words Without Borders.\n\nIn Hong Kong, literature writing has long been influenced by both the culture and social backgrounds from China and the Western world. Hence, its crime fiction has incorporated many distinguishing characteristics of all kinds of different crime literatures, depending on the political stance of the majority in Hong Kong and the specific era.\n\nIn the 1950s, many non-leftist writers decided to reside in Hong Kong to avoid the political stance of the newly established People’s Republic of China. The literature created at that time mainly focuses on anti-PRC, nostalgic and romantic topics. Crime fictions such as Immature, Obscene Society (半下流社会) written by Zhao Zifan (赵滋蕃) were created.\n\nThe first Chinese fiction in Taiwan came out during the period of Japanese occupation, the Showa era in Japan. Before then, most of Chinese fiction was reprinted from Mainland China and it was difficult to find an author from Taiwan. However, this kind of situation has gradually improved since the Taiwan People News (臺灣民報) was first published.\n\nThe first Chinese crime fiction written by Taiwanese writer Li Yitao (李逸濤) in 1909 was about a detective story called Deep Hatred (恨海), published by \"Kanbun Taiwan nichinichi shinpō\" (漢文臺灣日日新報), but the work has not been finished yet.\n\nQiu Xiaolong was a significant contributor to English-language Chinese crime fiction in the United States. He was born in Shanghai, but following the Tiananmen Square Protests he decided to remain in the US. Throughout his career he published nine crime-thriller/mystery novels. This includes the \"Death of a Red Heroine, When Red is Black\" and \"A Case of Two Cities.\" Specifically, \"Death of a Red Heroine\" was named the best first novel in 2001 at the Anthony Awards. These novels touches on various aspects of the Chinese Culture from ancient Confucianism to modern Chinese politics and justice system.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23147227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23147227", "title": "Cultural impact of the Guitar Hero series", "text": "Cultural impact of the Guitar Hero series\n\n\"Guitar Hero\" is a series of rhythm video games published by Activision in which players use guitar-shaped controllers to mimic the playing of numerous popular rock music songs in a score attack gameplay; later games in the series have included support for both drums and vocals and playing as a full band. With over $2 billion in total sales worldwide, the game series has made a significant cultural impact, becoming a \"cultural phenomenon\" and recognizable in the popular culture. The series has been found to influence younger players into learning real instruments, and has found application within the health care industry to help recovering patients.\n\nBoth \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" (a similar series of games developed by Harmonix, who originally developed \"Guitar Hero\"), have altered the video game and music industries. For video games, the introduction of \"Guitar Hero\" has led rhythm games to become one of the industries' largest growing markets. The series has also sparked the creation of both commercial and independently developed games with similar gameplay mechanics as well as learning tools using a real guitar in place of the controller. Older artists featured in \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" have experienced a surge in the popularity of their music, and the games have been seen as a way for younger audiences to experience the classic rock songs featured in the games. Newer bands and unsigned artists have also found success by being included in the game. This has led several bands to actively seek placement of their songs within the games. The impact of \"Guitar Hero\" on the music industry has caused music publishers to re-evaluate their approach to music licensing and their relationship with the video game industry.\n\nThe series' titles became very popular party games, which led them to be played in a variety of locales. In the wake of the series popularity several bars in the United States & Canada began offering \"\"Guitar Hero\" nights\" as an alternative to karaoke; one New York City bar experienced triple the business on such nights. Many concert tours, including the Family Values Tour feature \"Guitar Hero\" booths and contests between sets. \"Guitar Hero\" is responsible for introducing people to rock music and inspiring them to learn how to play guitar. A study by Youth Music found that 2.5 million out of 12 million children in the United Kingdom have begun learning how to play real instruments after playing music video games such as \"Guitar Hero\"; the group believes that these video games can be incorporated into music educational programs. Activision has teamed with the United Service Organizations to provide monetary support and copies of \"Guitar Hero III\" to the United States armed forces around the world.\n\n\"Guitar Hero\" has proven to be a useful tool in the development of children and as recovery for various injuries. Salon.com states that the games helped an 8-year-old guitarist learn sensitivity to rhythm, as well as develop the dexterity and independent hand usage necessary to play the instrument. \"Guitar Hero\" has been used alongside physical therapy to help recovering stroke patients as the games help with multiple limb coordination between fretting and strumming. Blondie drummer Clem Burke has worked with researchers at the University of Chichester and the University of Gloucestershire to determine how games like \"Guitar Hero\" can address issues of \"child and adult obesity, autism, stroke patients and health and mental well-being in the workplace\". Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have used \"Guitar Hero III\" and its controller to help amputee patients and to develop new prosthetic limbs for these patients. Researchers at Nevada Reno University have been able to modify a haptic feedback glove to work with the \"Guitar Hero\" freeware clone, \"Frets on Fire\", to create \"Blind Hero\", a music game that works on touch and audio only to appeal the game to visually impaired players. \"Guitar Hero\" was used as part of a Trent University youth sleep study which showed that players generally were better on replaying a song they had just been introduced to twelve hours later if that period included normal sleep.\n\nActivision stated on January 21, 2008 that North American sales from all of the \"Guitar Hero\" franchise have exceeded one billion dollars with over 16 million units sold, excluding downloadable content. Over 20 million songs have been sold as downloadable content as of July 2008, and 34 million by May 2009. As of October 9, 2008, the series has sold 23 million units with sales of US$1.6 billion, and as of May 2009 has earned US$2 billion at retail. Activision claims that \"Guitar Hero\" is the third largest video game franchise after the \"Mario\" and \"Madden NFL\" series, and is present in over 15 million households. \"Guitar Hero: World Tour\" along with other music games such as \"Rock Band 2\" have surged the video game market in 2008; NPD Group reports cited that music video games made up 19% of the overall software industry sales in July 2008, and 16% through November 2008, and contributing to a 32% year-to-date sector growth through July 2008. Total sales of music games doubled in 2008, with total sales of US$1.9 billion. \"Guitar Hero\" represented about half of that figure, with a total of $992M of retail sales in 2008, and was the highest selling brand of the year. At the 2009 Consumer Electronics Show, Activision CEO Mike Griffith stated that \"Guitar Hero III\" is the first video game to exceed one billion dollars in total sales. Activision reported that the \"Guitar Hero\" franchise had 55% of the United States and European markets during the first quarter of 2009. Analysts expect 2009 to be a critical year to determine the future direction of music games, whether the sector will continue to grow or will remain stagnant. Early analysis of the first half of 2009 showed that sales of both \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" franchise games were down by half from the same period in 2008, likely due to fewer purchases of the more expensive game bundles that include one or more controllers, as well as large discounts on the prices of older games. Viacom, parent company of MTV Games, reported a 32% drop in 2009 second quarter profits, partially driven by weak sales of \"Rock Band\" amid the poor economy of the period.\n\nThe series has created a market for products outside of the video games. McFarlane Toys has developed a series of six-inch-tall figurines based on the characters from the game. Brett Ratner, director for \"Rush Hour\" and \"\", has stated that he wishes to bring a movie based on \"Guitar Hero\" to theaters. However, Activision, the publisher of the series, did not approve the idea of a film adaptation.\nThe popularity of the \"Guitar Hero\" series has led to the development of several commercial and independent clones. Besides Harmonix' \"Rock Band\" series, Konami released \"Rock Revolution\" in 2008 which features drums and guitar (the game does not include vocals) similar to \"Guitar Hero World Tour\". \"PopStar Guitar\" for the PlayStation 2 and Wii systems, developed by XS Games, features gameplay similar to the \"Guitar Hero\" series, but features pop music, as opposed to rock and metal. Digital Praise released a Christian rock-themed guitar-based game called \"Guitar Praise\" also in 2008. \"Guitar Rising\", to be published for personal computers by Game Tank by 2009, is based on using a real guitar in order to perfect one's skills. \"\" is a game promoted by \"Rolling Stone\" for the Wii that uses two Wii remotes as virtual drumsticks. \"Frets on Fire\" is an open-source clone of \"Guitar Hero\" for personal computers that features freely available independent songs and allows users to create their own note tracks. Other games based on Guitar Hero include \"Battle of the Bands\" and \"Ultimate Band\". \"Guitar Hero\" has also influenced other games outside of the music game genre. Tim Schafer credits Harmonix and the first \"Guitar Hero\" game to help establish his pitching of his heavy metal-inspired game, \"Brütal Legend\", due to the increase in popularity of metal music from the success of \"Guitar Hero\". Guitar controllers have been repurposed as controls for an independently developed platform game, \"Fret Nice\". \"Rock of the Dead\" for the Wii is based on combining the aspects of \"The Typing of the Dead\" with using a \"Guitar Hero\" guitar controller to fend off zombies. A PlayStation Home themed space based on \"Guitar Hero\", called \"Guitar Hero: Backstage\", was released on March 26, 2009 in North Americas version, and includes a \"Simon says\"-like minigame called \"Guitar Hero-Master of Rock\", themed objects, and videos for the user.\n\n\"Guitar Hero\" has also been considered to have made the use of special peripherals more commonplace and acceptable for consumers for games that followed, including Nintendo's Wii console and games such as \"Mario Kart Wii\" and \"Wii Fit\".\nFan sites have also arisen to provide news and forums related to the \"Guitar Hero\" series. Scorehero is one such site that includes both forums and informal tracking of players' scores for both the \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" series; the site has received donations from Harmonix president Alex Rigopulos, and site members have been invited to pre-release demonstrations of upcoming games, often leading to information about tracks in these games.\n\"Guitar Hero\" now holds a place in the Guinness World Records in their Gamers Edition, tracking the highest score on a single song (Dragonforce's \"Through the Fire and Flames\") in \"Guitar Hero III\"; the record has held by both Chris Chike and Daniel Johnson, each outdoing each other in subsequent attempts; Johnson is the present holder of the record. Chike has received additional notice for full comboing Dragonforce's \"Through the Fire and Flames\". Both players' reputations have earned them spokespersons deals, Chike for The Ant Commandos, a third-party peripheral controller maker, and Johnson for eMazingGaming.com, a video game event promoter. Guinness also awarded the series ten world records in the Gamer's Edition 2008, including \"Best Selling Guitar Based Game\" and \"Biggest Funeral for a Fictional Object\", when in November 2006 a funeral for the air guitar was held in London, England as a publicity stunt for \"Guitar Hero II\"s release.\n\n\"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" have been considered a boon to the music industry in a manner similar to music videos in the 1980s. Both licensed and indie bands whose works have been included in the \"Guitar Hero\" games have gained further popularity from this inclusion. Both record companies and retailers have experienced increases of 200% to 300% in sales of songs after their inclusion in the series. Every \"Guitar Hero III\" song tracked by Nielsen SoundScan (62 of 70) saw an increase in digital download sales the week ending December 30, 2007, when many who got the game as a gift were playing it, and every song included in \"Guitar Hero III\" and \"Rock Band\" saw downloaded sales increase during 2007 between 15% to 843%. A survey conducted by Brown Universitys Kiri Miller found that 76% of the players of \"Guitar Hero\" bought the music they heard in the game. Indie group Bang Camaro's recognition increased after their song \"Push Push (Lady Lightning)\" appeared in \"Guitar Hero II\". The band DragonForce, whose song \"Through the Fire and Flames\" is featured as a bonus song in \"\", saw a 126% increase in CD sales in the week after the release of the game, and downloads of the song, selling fewer than 2,000 weekly, rose to more than 10,000 after \"Guitar Hero III\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release and approached 40,000 the week ending 2007-12-30. Even older, established groups such as Aerosmith saw an increase in sales at the same time \"Guitar Hero\" games containing their songs were released, such as a modest increase in download sales for its \"Same Old Song and Dance\", which rose to 2,041 from 374 copies the previous week; a 40% increase in the band's catalog was seen in the weeks following the release of \"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith\". According to Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, \"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith\" has made more money for Aerosmith than any of their previous albums. Both \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" are seen as new methods of music distribution; an analysis for market research company NPD Group states that \"As the video games industry grows, it's becoming an ever-more attractive promotional outlet for all kinds of industries.\" The games have also been seen as a way to introduce younger generations to music of the past; bands such as Living Colour, Warrant, The Grateful Dead, Poison, and Ratt have seen interest in their music rise due to the inclusion of their songs in the \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band\", as well as other music video games. Joel Peresman, president and CEO of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, attributes surges in attendance to the museum in 2008-2009, particularly in families with young children, in part to the success of \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\". The popularity of downloadable content for music games has led the UK Official Download Chart to consider including these sales in their compilation of sales performance data.\n\nBands or those that control the copyrights on bands' works have been in talks with the makers and distributions of both \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" as methods of achieving more exposure for the band. Following the announcement of \"Guitar Hero: Aerosmith\", Martin N. \"Marty\" Bandier, executive for Sony/ATV which owns the copyrights on The Beatles compositions, stated he was very interested in helping Activision bring a Beatles-themed \"Guitar Hero\" title to the market in a similar fashion. Both Activision and MTV Games were in talks with representatives of the Beatles to create a Beatles-themed game, until MTV Games secured an exclusive license with Apple Corps, Ltd. to produce \"\". Groups such as Van Halen, The Eagles, Steely Dan and Guns N' Roses have working deals with these companies to include their songs within future games. Other artists, having playing \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band\", may approach the game developers to ask for inclusion of songs specifically for their adaptability into playable tracks. However, not all bands are comfortable with this: Led Zeppelin has turned down offers from both games to include their music due to concerns that Jimmy Page and other members of the band have with releasing the master recordings of their music. There are also cases where bands want to be included, but the master recordings have been lost or are unusable. Some bands such as the Sex Pistols, Living Colour, and Aerosmith have rerecorded these songs, while other bands have been able to provide concert \"live\" master recordings. However, some larger artists are unable to do so. Neversoft director Brian Bright states that they do not expect to acquire songs from Pink Floyd and Prince due to such reasons. With the pending release of \"The Beatles: Rock Band\", Pink Floyd is also in active discussions to include its music in either \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band\", according to representatives for EMI.\n\n\"Guitar Hero\" and other rock music-based games work with record companies to license each song for its use, costing a per-song average of $25,000 for the rights to use a master recording and $10,000 for the rights to make a cover. The impact of \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" has caused record companies to create dedicated video game liaisons to handle the inclusions of songs in these games. The record and game companies work together to tie in releases of downloadable content with album releases and concert appearances, such as by the simultaneous release of Metallica's \"Death Magnetic\" album and as playable \"Guitar Hero\" tracks. However, some in the music industry have raised concerns that the music labels are not receiving fair compensation considering the success of the games. Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman and chief executive for Warner Music Group, stated that \"The amount being paid to the industry, even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control, is far too small.\" Tim Riley, vice president of music affairs at Activision, believes that the increase in popularity of the game series has led more people, including musicians and music labels, to want to be part of the success: \"The number of people interested in being associated with the game is probably a thousand times more than we can get into the game.\" Activision CEO Robert Kotick has stated, in response to the record company's claims, that the impact that the \"Guitar Hero\" games have caused game developers and publishers to question if they \"should be paying any money at all and whether it should be the reverse.\" Mötley Crüe manager Allen Kovac noted that artists make a larger share of the sale of each downloaded game song compared to iTunes, and that bands that own their own master recordings earn even a larger percentage from music licensing rights. Michael Pachter, an industry analyst for Wedbush Morgan, noted that \"Guitar Hero\" is not dependent on a single record label, as there is nearly a 2000-year supply of songs available at the current rate of content releases, and a full music industry denial to the game series could lead to anti-trust measures. Patcher also contrasted Bronfman's view, stating that users are not buying the games for the songs, but for the game, with each song providing its own challenge. However, analysis believe that Activision's attitude on music licensing may have influenced the decision of Apple Corps, Ltd. to give the lucrative licensing agreement for The Beatles' music to MTV Games, who were more flexible in their negotiations.\n\nSome musicians have been critical of \"Guitar Hero\"'s impact on the industry. Jack White of The White Stripes stated that he was disappointed to learn that video games are the most likely venue where younger audiences will be exposed to new works, while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin does not believe that people can learn how to play real instruments from their video game counterparts. Similarly, Prince has turned down opportunities to have his music in the series, stating that he felt that it was \"more important that kids learn how to actually play the guitar\".\n\n\"Guitar Hero\" has made several appearances in popular culture.\n\"Guitar Hero II\" is the centerpiece of an episode of \"South Park\" titled \"Guitar Queer-O\", in which Stan and Kyle overindulge in \"Guitar Hero II\" and become treated as though they were real-life rock stars. The episode was first broadcast on November 7, 2007, ten days after the American release of \"Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock\". \"Metalocalypse\" (created by Titmouse Studio, who also provided cutscene animations within the \"Guitar Hero\" game) has made reference to \"Guitar Hero\"; in one example, the episode \"Dethkids,\" a sick child composes a song for Dethklok rhythm guitarist Toki Wartooth using a \"Guitar Hero\" controller. Ellen DeGeneres has played \"Guitar Hero\" several times in 2008 during the monologue of her syndicated talk show. In the January 25, 2008, episode she is seen playing along to \"Barracuda\", which segues to Heart performing the song for the audience. During the season 7 finale of \"American Idol\", finalists David Cook and David Archuleta appeared in separate commercials for the games, where they each parodied Tom Cruise dancing to \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" in the movie \"Risky Business\". This parody has been used by director Brett Ratner to create advertisements for \"Guitar Hero World Tour\", featuring celebrities such as Kobe Bryant, Tony Hawk, Alex Rodriguez, Michael Phelps, Corbin Bleu, Heidi Klum, and Marisa Miller.\n\nPolitical cartoonist Steve Breen illustrated a cartoon where Queen Elizabeth II received \"Guitar Hero\" as a gift from visiting President Barack Obama, a parody of Obama's visit to England in April 2009 during which he gave Queen Elizabeth II an iPod.\n\nA 2009 \"Close to Home\" comic strip portrayed a young boy blowing into a tuba-shaped joystick while playing a video game, as his parents cover their ears, with the caption: \"Despite the success of \"Guitar Hero\", \"Tuba Hero\" bombs big-time.\"\n\nDuring Halftime of MLS Cup 2009 two league players, Jimmy Conrad of the Kansas City Wizards and Freddy Montero of Seattle Sounders FC faced off to Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\" in \"Guitar Hero World Tour\".\n\nA scene, written into the script by Vince Vaughn, in \"Couples Retreat\" features Vaughn's character challenging a resort employee to a \"Guitar Hero 5\"-faceoff.\n\nMC Lars' This Gigantic Robot Kills includes a song called \"Guitar Hero Hero (Beating Guitar Hero Does Not Make You Slash)\", poking fun at frequent players of GH. It features a solo from Paul Gilbert. (The song's lyrics reference the following real-guitar players in addition to those two: Robert Johnson, Dimebag Darrell, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix.) Mariah Carey's music video for her song \"Touch My Body\" features a nerd strumming on a \"Guitar Hero\" controller. The music video for San Diego rock band Switchfoot's song \"Awakening\" featured two men going home and competing separately on \"Guitar Hero\", using stop-motion cardboard cutouts to simulate the video game interface. The music video for Eminem's \"We Made You\" includes portions of the song where Eminem is singing in front of a \"Guitar Hero\"-like note highway. The video for Brad Paisley's \"Start a Band\", featuring Keith Urban, includes a \"Guitar Hero\"-like \"Guitar Showdown\" video game as part of the video's story.\n\nThe series' popularity spread to the sports world; Detroit Tigers' pitcher Joel Zumaya injured himself during the 2006 playoffs playing \"Guitar Hero.\" In professional wrestling, former TNA Wrestling tag team of Jimmy Rave and Lance Rock, known as The Rock 'n Rave Infection, have a gimmick of dressing as characters from the game and strumming the guitar controllers on their way to the ring.\n\nThe name \"Guitar Hero\" is often juxtapositioned with other instruments or other tools for humorous effects. There are T-shirts available from at least one vendor, parodying the \"Guitar Hero\" logo with a number of different instruments, from violin to bagpipes. Marketing for \"The Simpsons Game\" included mock posters for \"Sitar Hero\", depicting \"The Simpsons\" character Apu with a controller with 21 buttons and a small list of songs parodying real-world songs, such as \"Pour Some Curry on Me\" (a parody of Def Leppard's \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\") and \"Shankar Groove Thing\" (a parody of Peaches & Herb's \"Shake Your Groove Thing\"), a parody Harmonix praised. GameSpot released an April Fools' article in 2006 announcing \"Cowbell Hero\" as a successor to the first game, referencing the \"More cowbell\" skit from \"Saturday Night Live\". Also, a \"Cowbell Hero\" T-shirt appears among Chuck's collection of shirts in an episode of the NBC series, \"Chuck\". One Penny Arcade comic strip envisioned a game entitled \"Photoshop Hero\", which has become a design for one of their T-shirts. A 2008 FoxTrot Sunday comic showed the characters Jason and Marcus playing a video game called \"Chamber Music Hero.\" The satirical newspaper The Onion published an article entitled \"Activision Reports Sluggish Sales For Sousaphone Hero.\" In the 15th episode of the first season of the Adult Swim cartoon \"Metalocalypse\", a young girl played a song for Dethklok member Toki Wartooth with a \"Guitar Hero\" controller. Later, in the 3rd episode of the second season, one Dethklok fan is seen with a \"Guitar Hero\" controller in his room whilst illegally downloading Dethklok MP3s.\n\nOn March 2010, the Office For National Statistics (UK) announced that \"Guitar Hero\" will be used to gauge the country's inflation risk. Viacom Inc.'s \"Rock Band\" was also included to reflect changes in (UK) consumer spending.\n\nA \"Guitar Hero\" reality show could be developed in the future, along with a possible concert tour.\n"}

He specialises in German military history of World War II. Stahel authored several books on the military operations of the first six months of the Eastern Front, including on the launching of Operation Barbarossa, the Battle of Kiev (1941) and the Battle for Moscow.\n\nStahel completed an honours degree at Monash University and Boston College. He has an MA in War Studies from King's College London and a PhD in 2007 from the Humboldt University of Berlin.

Reviewing Stahel's \"Kiev 1941: Hitler's Battle for Supremacy in the East\" for the \"New Republic\", the historian Richard Evans notes that \"the story of the Battle of Kiev has been told many times, but seldom in such detail as it is in David Stahel’s book\", at the same time \"convey[ing] extremely complex military action with exemplary clarity\". The reviewer writes:\n\nUnlike more traditional military historians, Stahel is acutely aware of the wider context of the action, from Hitler’s overall aims for the war to the importance of logistics for the outcome; from the murderous racism and ruthless pragmatism with which the German leaders, military as well as political, condemned so many Soviet civilians to starve and so many Jewish inhabitants to terrible death, to the postwar disputes among historians and retired generals over Hitler’s strategy.\n\nEvans commends Stahel for his \"refreshing realism\" in not \"following traditional military historians’ often overly positive and simplistic descriptions of 'great' generals and 'decisive' battles\" and exploring \"convincingly if not entirely originally\" how the foundations of the German war efforts were already beginning to crumble by the time of the victory at Kiev heralded in Nazi propaganda as decisive.\n\n\n\n"}

Between 1318 and 1552, the geographical horizons of the Church of the East, which had once stretched from Egypt to China, narrowed drastically. By 1552, with the exception of a number of East Syriac communities in India, the eccesiastical jurisdiction of the Church of the East was confined to its original heartland in northern Mesopotamia.\n\nBy the end of the thirteenth century, although isolated East Syriac outposts persisted to the southeast of the Great Zab, the districts of northern Mesopotamia included in the metropolitan provinces of Mosul and Nisibis were clearly regarded as the heartland of the Church of the East. When the monks Bar Sawma and Marcos (the future patriarch Yahballaha III) arrived in Mesopotamia from China in the late 1270s, they visited several East Syriac monasteries and churches:\nThey arrived in Baghdad, and from there they went to the great church of Kokhe, and to the monastery of Mar Mari the apostle, and received a blessing from the relics of that country. And from there they turned back and came to the country of Beth Garmaï, and they received blessings from the shrine of Mar Ezekiel, which was full of helps and healings. And from there they went to Erbil, and from there to Mosul. And they went to Shigar, and Nisibis and Mardin, and were blessed by the shrine containing the bones of Mar Awgin, the second Christ. And from there they went to Gazarta d'Beth Zabdaï, and they were blessed by all the shrines and monasteries, and the religious houses, and the monks, and the fathers in their dioceses.\nWith the exception of the patriarchal church of Kokhe in Baghdad and the nearby monastery of Mar Mari, all these sites were well to the north of Baghdad, in the districts of northern Mesopotamia where historic East Syriac Christianity survived into the twentieth century.\n\nA similar pattern is evident several years later. Eleven bishops were present at the consecration of the Patriarch Timothy II in 1318: the metropolitans Joseph of Ilam, Abdisho of Nisibis and Shemon of Mosul, and the bishops Shemon of Beth Garmaï, Shemon of Tirhan, Shemon of Balad, Yohannan of Beth Waziq, Yohannan of Shigar, Abdisho of Hnitha, Isaac of Beth Daron and Ishoyahb of Tella and Barbelli (Marga). Timothy himself had been metropolitan of Erbil before his election as patriarch. Again, with the exception of Ilam (whose metropolitan, Joseph, was present in his capacity of 'designated successor' (\"natar kursya\") all the dioceses represented were in northern Mesopotamia.\n\nThe exterior provinces of the Church of the East, with the important exception of India, collapsed during the second half of the fourteenth century. Although little is known of the circumstances of the demise of the East Syriac dioceses in Central Asia (which may never have fully recovered from the destruction caused by the Mongols a century earlier), it may have been due to a combination of persecution, disease, and isolation.\n\nThe blame for the destruction of the East Syriac communities east of Iraq has often been thrown upon the Turco-Mongol leader Timur, whose campaigns during the 1390s spread havoc throughout Persia and Central Asia. There is no reason to doubt that the destruction wrought by Timur fell indiscriminately upon Christians and Muslims alike, but in many parts of Central Asia, Christianity had died out decades before Timur's campaigns. The surviving evidence from Central Asia, including a large number of dated graves, indicates that the crisis for the East Syriac church occurred in the 1340s rather than the 1390s.\n\nSeveral contemporaries, including the papal envoy John of Marignolli, mention the murder of the Latin bishop Richard and six of his companions in 1339 or 1340 by a Muslim mob in Almaliq, the chief city of Tangut, and the forcible conversion of the city’s Christians to Islam. The last tombstones in two East Syriac cemeteries discovered in Mongolia around the end of the nineteenth century date from 1342, and several commemorate deaths during a plague in 1338. In China, the last references to East Syriac and Latin Christians date from the 1350s, and it is likely that all foreign Christians were expelled from China soon after the revolution of 1368, which replaced the Mongol Yuan dynasty with the xenophobic Ming dynasty.\n\nThe collapse of East Syriac Christianity in Asia was probably so complete because it had always been the custom of the Church of the East to send out bishops from Mesopotamia to the dioceses of the ‘exterior provinces’. In the chaos which followed the death of the Ilkhan Abu Said in 1335, it may have been unable to send out fresh bishops to Central Asia, and without leaders of their own, the absorption of these communities by Islam was inevitable.\n\nIt is possible that several East Syriac dioceses in Iraq were destroyed during the savage campaigns of Timur in western Asia between 1380 and 1405. The West Syriac centre of Tagrit in the irhan district was sacked by Timur, ending its importance as the residence of the local Syriac Orthodox primates, titled as maphrians, and the neighbouring East Syriac communities in Beth Garmaï and Adiabene may have been treated in a similar fashion. In the absence of a better context, the disappearance of the traditional East Syriac dioceses of Beth Waziq, Beth Daron, Tirhan and Daquqa, all of which had bishops earlier in the fourteenth century, may have been a result of Timur’s campaigns. In Ilam, the metropolitan diocese of Jundishapur (last mentioned in 1318) and the dioceses of Susa and Shushter (last mentioned towards the end of the thirteenth century) may also have come to an end at this period.\n\nBy contrast, East Syriac Christianity continued to flourish in northern Mesopotamia. Although East Syriac communities disappeared from several villages in the Nisibis and Mosul districts in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, patterns of settlement seem generally to have persisted without radical disturbance. Although insufficient information has survived to be certain, there may well have been a continuous succession of bishops in the dioceses of Nisibis, Mosul and Erbil, and perhaps also in the dioceses of Hesna d’Kifa, Gazarta, Salmas and Urmi. Timur’s campaigns may have stimulated a migration of East Syriac Christians from the plains into the hills of the Bohtan and Hakkari districts, as a new diocese was created in the fifteenth century for Atel and Bohtan, and perhaps around the same time for Berwari.\n\nDuring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, there was also a metropolitan diocese for an East Syriac merchant community in Cyprus. This community came under strong pressure from the Latin Church, and the diocese lapsed after the metropolitan Timothy converted to Catholicism in 1445.\n\nBy the middle of the sixteenth century, the East Syriac communities in India were all that survived of the Church of the East’s exterior provinces (though the names of the old provinces of Armenia, Arzun, Jerusalem and China persisted or were later revived in the titles of the metropolitans of Nisibis, Hesna d’Kifa, Amid and India respectively). In the west there were small East Syriac communities in Jerusalem, Aleppo, and Cyprus, but without bishops. Small communities could still be found in the Erbil, Kirkuk and Tabriz districts, but the main strength of the church was confined to northern Mesopotamia, in the districts which had earlier comprised the metropolitan provinces of Nisibis and Mosul. Although there was continuous East Syriac settlement in these districts between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries the traditional dioceses of Beth Nuhadra, Beth Bgash, Marga (Tella and Barbelli), Hnitha and Salakh in the province of Mosul, and Balad and Tamanon in the province of Nisibis, ceased to exist at an unknown date during this period.\n\nBetween 1490 and 1503, the Church of the East responded to the request of a mission to Mesopotamia from the East Syriac Christians of the Malabar Coast of India for bishops to be sent out to them. In 1490, two Christians from Malabar arrived in Gazarta to petition the Patriarch Shemon IV to consecrate a bishop for their church. Two monks of the monastery of Mar Awgin were consecrated bishops and were sent to India. Shemon IV died in 1497, to be followed by the short-reigned Shemon V, who died in 1502. His successor, Eliya V, consecrated three more bishops for India in April 1503. These bishops sent a report to the Patriarch from India in 1504, describing the condition of the East Syriac Church in India and reporting the recent arrival of the Portuguese. Eliya had already died by the time this letter arrived in Mesopotamia, and it was received by his successor, Shemon VI (1504–38).\n\nThe disappearance of so many old dioceses was probably a consequence of the introduction of hereditary succession in the middle of the fifteenth century by the Patriarch Shemon IV, which eventually resulted in a shortage of bishops in the Church of the East. The Patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb is said to have entrusted the administration of some vacant dioceses to laymen, and to have consecrated two nephews as metropolitans, aged twelve and fifteen respectively, presumably because no older relatives were available. In 1552, the Church of the East had only three bishops; the bishops of Salmas, Erbil and Adarbaigan, who all supported Sulaqa’s election.\n\nThe diocese of Nisibis, the seat of an East Syriac metropolitan bishop since 410, survived into the second decade of the seventeenth century. By then, Nisibis was little more than a village and the future of East Syriac Christianity in the region lay with the Chaldean communities recently established in the towns of Amid and Mardin. Both these towns had energetic Chaldean bishops at this period, and the historic diocese of Nisibis was in consequence formally abolished at the Chaldean Synod of Amid in 1616. The title of Nisibis was thereafter included in the title of the metropolitans of Mardin.\n\nSeveral metropolitans of Nisibis are attested between 1318 and 1616. The celebrated East Syriac author Abdisho Bar Brikha, who flourished during the reign of the patriarch Yahballaha III (1281–1317), was metropolitan of Nisibis during the early years of the fourteenth century and was present at the consecration of the Patriarch Timothy II in 1318. The date of his death is not known, but according to a list of metropolitans of Nisibis compiled in the second half of the fourteenth century, his immediate successors were Mikha'il, Abdisho, Yahballaha and Ishoyahb.\n\nThree metropolitans of Nisibis are known from the fifteenth century. A metropolitan named Timothy is mentioned in the colophon of a manuscript copied in 1429/30. A metropolitan named Abdisho donated a manuscript to the church of Mar Pethion in Amid in May 1458. The metropolitan Eliya of 'Nisibis, Armenia, Mardin, Amid, Siirt and Hesna d'Kifa' is mentioned in the colophons of three manuscripts copied between 1477 and 1483.\n\nNo metropolitans of Nisibis are attested during the first half of the sixteenth century, and the office may well have remained vacant for much of this period. If so, the vacancy was filled shortly after the schism of 1552. A metropolitan of Nisibis named Ishoyahb, son of the priest Samuel of Mosul, is mentioned in the colophons of a series of manuscripts copied between 1554 and 1575, associated with the traditionalist Patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb and his successor Eliya VII. Unusually for a metropolitan of Nisibis, his title also included Amid and Mardin, both of which had Catholic bishops consecrated by Sulaqa, and he was probably consecrated by Shemon VII Ishoyahb in response to the strong Catholic challenge mounted by Sulaqa in the western districts.\n\nThe metropolitan Joseph of Erbil became patriarch in 1318, taking the name Timothy II. The diocese of Erbil seems to have persisted into the seventeenth century, but only four subsequent metropolitans of Erbil are known. The metropolitan Yohannan Bar Yak, who flourished at an unknown date in the fourteenth century, was the author of several verses preserved in a manuscript in the Mardin collection. In the fifteenth century, the writer Ishoyahb Bar Mqaddam, one of the few known East Syriac authors at this period, is mentioned as metropolitan of Erbil in 1443 and 1452, and may have taken the name Thomas. The three remaining bishops in the East Syriac hierarchy who supported Sulaqa's election in 1552 included an unnamed metropolitan of Erbil.\n\nAn East Syriac diocese for Atel and the Bohtan district, which persisted into the seventeenth century, appears to have been founded in the fifteenth century. The earliest-known bishop of Atel, Quriaqos, is mentioned in the colophon of a manuscript copied in 1437.\n\nA metropolitan of Atel named Yohannan is mentioned in a colophon of 1497, and was probably the metropolitan Mar Yohannan present five years later at the consecration of the patriarch Eliya V in September 1502. An elderly bishop named Yohannan, perhaps the same man, was killed at Atel on 6 June 1512 with 40 other persons, including Christian priests and deacons, by the soldiers of Muhammad Bek.\n\nA few years later, three colophons mention another bishop of Atel named Yohannan: as bishop of the 'Bokhtaye' in 1521, as bishop of 'Atel and the Bokhtaye' in 1526, and as bishop of 'Atel and Dilan' in 1534. He is perhaps to be identified with the bishop Yohannan 'of the fortress of Atel' who was burned at the stake at Amid in 1572.\n\nAn East Syriac merchant community was established in Cyprus after the fall of Acre in 1292. After the destruction of the Frankish kingdoms in Syria and Palestine, Cyprus became the forward base for crusading activity during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and Famagusta replaced Acre as a centre for trade with the cities of northern Syria and Cilicia. By the end of the fourteenth century, the island was the seat of a Nestorian metropolitan, who seems to have inherited the title of Tarsus. The Latin Church exerted considerable pressure on this heretical community. In 1340, the Nestorian metropolitan Eliya made a Catholic profession of faith, and in 1445, the metropolitan Timothy also converted to Catholicism. Most of the Nestorians of Cyprus followed the example of their bishops. To distinguish these converts from their recalcitrant Nestorian brethren, Pope Eugene IV christened them 'Chaldeans', because they used the Chaldean language (as Syriac was then called in western Europe). By the middle of the sixteenth century, the island's remaining Nestorians were confined to the town of Famagusta. This community was dispersed within a few decades of the town’s capture by the Turks in 1571, but a fine fourteenth-century Nestorian church, built in Provençal style by the wealthy merchant prince Francis Lakhas, can still be seen in Famagusta.\n\n\n"}

J. Ayer.\n\nFrederick Charles Copleston was born 10 April 1907 near Taunton, Somerset, England. He was raised in the Anglican faith—his uncle, Reginald Stephen Copleston, was an Anglican bishop of Calcutta; another uncle, Ernest Copleston, was the Bishop of Colombo. Copleston was educated at Marlborough College from 1920 to 1925. At the age of eighteen, he converted to the Roman Catholic faith, which caused great stress in his family. Despite his initial objections, his father helped him complete his education at St John's College, Oxford, where he studied from 1925 to 1929. He graduated from Oxford University in 1929 having managed a third in classical moderations and a good second at Greats.\n\nIn 1930, Copleston became a Jesuit. After studying at the Jesuit novitiate in Roehampton for two years, he resettled at Heythrop, where in 1937 he was ordained a Jesuit priest at Heythrop College. In 1938 he traveled to Germany to complete his training, returning to Britain just before the outbreak of war in 1939. Copleston originally intended to study for his doctorate at the Gregorian University in Rome, but the war now made that impossible. Instead, he accepted an offer to return to Heythrop College to teach the history of philosophy to the few remaining Jesuits there.\n\nWhile teaching at Heythrop College, Copleston began writing his influential multi-volume \"A History of Philosophy\" (1946–75), a textbook that presents clear accounts of ancient, medieval, and modern philosophy. Still highly respected, Copleston's history has been described as \"a monumental achievement\" that \"stays true to the authors it discusses, being very much a work in exposition\".\n\nCopleston achieved a degree of popularity in the media for debating the existence of God with Bertrand Russell in a celebrated 1948 BBC broadcast; the following year he debated logical positivism and the meaningfulness of religious language with his friend the analytic philosopher A. J. Ayer.\n\nThroughout the rest of his academic career, Copleston accepted a number of honorary roles, including Visiting Professor at Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he spent six months each year lecturing from 1952 to 1968. In 1970, he was made Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), and in 1972 he was given a personal professorship from Heythrop College, since re-established by the University of London. In 1975, he was made an Honorary Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford.\n\nAfter officially retiring in 1974, he continued to lecture. From 1974 to 1982, Copleston was Visiting Professor at the University of Santa Clara, and from 1979 to 1981, he delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Aberdeen, which were published as \"Religion and the One\". These lectures were attempted to \"express themes perennial in his thinking and more personal than in his history\". Toward the end of his life, Copleston received honorary doctorates from several institutions, including Santa Clara University, California, Uppsala University, and the University of St Andrews.\n\nCopleston was offered memberships in the Royal Institute of Philosophy and in the Aristotelian Society. In 1993 he was made CBE. Copleston died on 3 February 1994 at St Thomas' Hospital in London, at the age of 86.\n\nIn addition to his influential multi-volume \"History of Philosophy\" (1946–75), one of Copleston's most significant contributions to modern philosophy was his work on the theories of Saint Thomas Aquinas. He attempted to clarify Aquinas's Five Ways (in the \"Summa Theologica\") by making a distinction between \"in fieri\" causes and \"in esse\" causes. By doing so, Copleston makes clear that Aquinas wanted to put forth the concept of an omnipresent God rather than a being that could have disappeared after setting the chain of cause and effect into motion.\n\n"}

Later, the term sometimes described youths in general. While in German, it is still in use today for young, aggressive, mostly male adolescents, it has mostly fallen out of active usage in English.\n\nThe word itself literally means “the half-strong”. Its origins can be traced back to a manufacturing technology named ' (= to tumble/ mill/ full), via the word’s synonym '– “half tumbleds”. Seen that way, the word is a defamation, because it can be associated with “unformed” and “premature” (in German, there also are a few other slight verbal slanders containing “halb”: e.g. ' (literally: half-educated) and ' (literally: half dish / half portion, used for children or adolescents that appear weak). But it is likely that the defamation was not as defamatory to the subculture itself, because its members began calling themselves “Halbstarke”, too. \nIn German, both terms also have an adjective-form (' / ').\n\nThese ' had found prototypes for their fashion and style in American movies, e.g. James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (German title: ') and Marlon Brando, as well as the stars of rock 'n' roll, that was gaining popularity then. In 1956 Karin Baal and Horst Buchholz became idols thanks to the movie \"Die Halbstarken\". That same year Bill Haley & His Comets' song Rock Around The Clock reached #1 in the German Pop charts.\nOften, the \" wore a quiff, jeans, checked shirts and leather jackets. Their look separated them from the other, more widespread, German youth culture. Mopeds and motorbikes were very popular and used for riding in 'gangs' (as seen in American movies).\nBecause there weren't a lot of alternatives, the Halbstarken often spent their leisure time outdoors. Their cliques met at corners of the road, in parks or at other public places. This behaviour wasn’t appreciated by elder citizens and so they described it as “bumming around” (\").\nRock 'n' roll offered tunes and rhythms that were revolutionary and a catalyzer for the youths' emotions and fears, unlike the then-popular but shallow genre Schlager. The effect of this was probably maximized by the new music being rejected by wide parts of the population.\nDuring the 1950s, more or less 5% of youth could be referred to as \"\".\n\nThe first Halbstarken riots happened after concerts or cinema screenings, which usually were preceded later uprisings as well. \nOn December 30, 1956 about 4000 juveniles walked through Dortmund’s city, affronting passers-by, rampaging and having battles with the police, after a cinema show of \"Außer Rand und Band\" (\"Rock Around the Clock\" with Bill Haley)\nBig riots occurred especially from 1956 to 1958. Often, the furniture of cinemas and concert halls was totally destroyed. These riots started severe discussions in media and politics. \nThe seeming sense- and directionlessness of the riots wasn’t comprehensible. Often, the American popular culture was considered guilty.\nNowadays, the riots and all of the Halbstarken-phenomenon is seen as a protest against society and its authorities which seemed draconic and bleak. But the protest was neither organized nor politically motivated.\n\n\n"}

Beginning in 1532, he worked as secretary for various members of the clergy in Rome and Naples. In 1540, he gained employment in Padua with the son of Cardinal-humanist Pietro Bembo. While working for Bembo's son, he met and became friends with notable humanists of the time and was a contemporary of Annibal Caro. He also gained fame from his poetry, which earned him an invitation to teach philosophy at the University of Genoa in 1544. While there, he was commissioned to write a history of the Republic of Genoa since 1528. \n\nIn 1541, Bonfadio, among others, coined the term \"una terza natura\", meaning 'nature improved by art', and subsequently, many designers utilized the concept. Large-scale views of the Medici villas, the grand vistas of Louis XIV, and the planning of 16th-century and later English country houses show how this idea was incorporated. \n\nBonfadio's humanist views earned him some powerful enemies in Genoa. In 1550, after he had completed \"Annales Genuendis, ab anno 1528 recuperatae libertatis usque ad annum 1550\" (his history of the Republic of Genoa from 1528 to 1550), his writings angered the powerful Genoese families the Dorias, the Adornos, the Spinolas, and the Fieschi, who sought revenge against him for daring to record and judge their actions. They proceeded to accuse him of sodomy, for which he was arrested, tried, and condemned to death. He was beheaded, and his body was burnt. The minutes of his trial have been lost.\n\nThe \"Annales Genuendis\" have been translated into Italian by Paschetti, and a new Latin edition was published at Brescia in 1747.\nScholars have had difficulty determining the exact date of his execution. Most official sources report it as having taken place in 1550, while others give the date as 1560, or even as late as 1580, though the latter date has been widely discredited by later scholars.\n\n\n"}

The work he did gave a major boost to the national historiography.\n\nHe belonged to the so-called \"Generation 1925\", along with other eminent personalities like Efraím Cardozo, Hipolito Sanchez Quell and R. Antonio Ramos. His studies on Doctor José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia eventually became the book \"The Supreme Dictator\", today regarded as the most comprehensive, objective and serious work on the subject. He was also a professor, diplomat and politician. During the Chaco War he played a major role in promoting information and media.\n\nHe pursued primary and secondary education in San José and at the National College and earned his doctorate in 1929, after defending his thesis on the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nChaves' uncle was Mr. Federico Chaves, who was president between the years 1949 and 1954. His brothers were prominent personalities of national policy, Hugo, Herman and Juan Ramon Chaves. The latter was president of the Colorado Party for many years. Julio César had membership in the Colorado Party until 1973, when he joined the Liberal Party.\n\nDuring the Chaco War, Chaves worked at the \"Department II\", first under the command of Tomás Romero Pereira and then as chief until the end of the war.\n\nIn 1934, in mid-July, at the express request of President Eusebio Ayala and General José Félix Estigarribia, Chaves organized (as head of Department II) the Directorate Press and Propaganda (popularly known as Radio Press), which was presented in the form of daily bulletins. This work had a great impact nationally and internationally and served to raise troop morale.\n\nIt was also after the war, the civil fiscal year 1936, and deputy national, 1938. At that time he was an active military in the Liberal Youth Club, along with young people such as Efraím Cardozo, Carlos Pastore, Horacio Fernandez, Juan G. Peroni, Villagra Maffiodo Salvador, Francisco Sapena, Emilio Saguier Aceval, Pedro R. Espínola, Paul Max Ynsfrán, Alejandro Marin Churches, Artemio Mereles, Juan B. Wasmosy, among others. This was the group that launched and supported the presidential candidacy of General José Félix Estigarribia in 1939, imposed on the criterion of liberal old guard who wanted a civilian president.\n\nIn 1939, Chaves was sent as minister to Bolivia and then to Peru as an ambassador in 1940. With the assumption of General Higinio Morínigo as president of the republic after the death of Estigarribia, who took exile in Buenos Aires from the year 1941.\n\nHe was perhaps among the more profitable exiles of the country because Chaves began to develop part of his historiography work there.\n\nChaves was also president of the Academy of Paraguayan History from 1956 to 1973 and again from 1984 to 1986, and the Academia de la Lengua Española from 1975 until his death. He was also president of the PEN Club and the Paraguayan Institute of Hispanic Culture, as well as a member of academies and institutes from various countries, the American Institute of History of Madrid and the Royal Academy of Arts of the Spanish capital. He was a lecturer in various Latin American capitals and major cultural centers of Europe.\n\nIn 1936 Chaves wrote \"El Chaco in adjustments for peace\" (unpublished), and in 1937 edited \"History of relations between Buenos Aires and Paraguay\".\n\nHis other works include:\n\nDr. Julio Cesar Chaves is the creator of an unpublished monograph, which deals with the important actions that he took in the Chaco War. This is a valuable document on the work that he accomplished in the Department II, his management of \"Prensa y Propaganda\" that depended directly on the Commander in Chief of Army Operations.\n\nDepartment II was organized by the then mayor Tomás Romero Pereira, supported by Chaves, and its task included military intelligence. \"Prensa y Propaganda\" depended directly on Chaves by express order of president Eusebio Ayala, who mandated him to carry out daily bulletins to counter Bolivian propaganda. According to Chaves himself, these bulletins were captured by the main radiotelegraph stations in the country and the following American countries: Bolivia Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru.\n\nPresident Ayala wrote the first three materials as a model. The first alluded to the Chilean mercenaries in the Bolivian army, the second to the superiority of the Paraguayan soldiers' morale over the Bolivian, and the third to the resources expended by Bolivia during the Chaco struggles. Bolivian prisoners were very valuable as sources of information for these bulletins, which led to a deterioration in the minds of the enemy combatants’ side, as acknowledged after the war by Colonel David Toro, a prominent Bolivian leader.\n\nChaves died in Asunción on February 20, 1989, a few months after his 81st birthday.\n\n\n"}

It has a population of 389,494 people, covers , and has a population of 9 inhabitants per square kilometer. It is noted as one of the best-preserved colonial cities in Brazil.\n\nOlinda features a number of major tourist attractions, such as a historic downtown area (World Heritage Site), churches, and the Carnival of Olinda, a popular street party, very similar to traditional Portuguese carnivals, with the addition of African influenced dances. Unlike in Rio de Janeiro and Salvador, in Olinda, admission to Carnival is free. All the festivities are celebrated on the streets, and there are no bleachers or roping. There are hundreds of small musical groups (sometimes featuring a single performer) in many genres.\n\nSeveral indigenous tribes occupied the coast of Northeastern Brazil for several thousand years, and the hills of the present day municipality of Olinda had settlements of Caetés and Tupinambá tribes, which were frequently at war. French mercenaries are thought to be the first Europeans to get to the region, but the Portuguese exploited intertribal rivalries and managed to build a stronghold on the former Caeté village in the higher hill. Recent studies by the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco [Federal University of Pernambuco] have uncovered new evidence of the pre-colonial population of the area. The settlement of Olinda was founded in 1535 by Duarte Coelho Pereira; it was elevated to a town on March 12, 1537. It was made the seat of the Territorial Prelature of Pernambuco in 1614, becoming the Diocese of Olinda in 1676. The economy of the region was dominated by the production of sugarcane. The importation of slaves from Africa to support the economy made Olinda a colonial stronghold. By 1600 its economy was based on sugar, and imported African slave labor had made it a colonial stronghold. Slavery existed in Olinda until the Lei Áurea, or Golden Law, abolished slavery in Brazil in 1888.\n\nOlinda was the capital of the hereditary captaincy of Pernambuco, but was burned by Dutch invaders. The Portuguese built their town on the hill, for practical purposes (sewers) and to make it easier to defend. In the 17th century the Kingdom of Portugal was united with Spain (the 1580-1640 Iberian Union period). Taking advantage of this period of Portuguese weakness, the area around Olinda and Recife was occupied by the Dutch who gained access to the Portuguese sugarcane plantations. John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil in 1637 by the Dutch West India Company on recommendation of Frederick Henry. He landed at Recife, the port of Pernambuco and the chief stronghold of the Dutch, in January 1637. By a series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from Sergipe on the south to São Luís de Maranhão in the north. He likewise conquered the Portuguese possessions of Saint George del Mina, Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would reestablish its authority over the lost territories of the Portuguese Empire.\n\nOlinda declined in importance after the Dutch invasion. Recife became the capital of Pernambuco in 1827. The city now serves as a suburb to the greater Recife metropolitan area. Due to the historic position of the city, its Cathedral, a World Heritage Site, São Salvador do Mundo, remains the primary seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olinda e Recife, with a co-cathedral in Recife, while Olinda also has a Minor Basilica, again World Heritage Site (Minor): Basílica Abacial do Mosteiro de São Bento de Olinda.\n\nBesides its natural beauty, Olinda is also one of Brazil's main cultural centers. Declared in 1982 a Historical and Cultural Patrimony of Humanity by the UNESCO, Olinda relives the magnificence of the past every year during the Rio-style Carnival, on the rhythms of \"frevo\", \"maracatu\" and others rhythms.\n\nThe main economic activities in Olinda are based in tourism, commerce, transportation industry and artcraft. The tourist sector has a boom every Carnival when thousands of people are in the old historic town center.\n\nEconomy by Sector\n\n\n"}

His father Konstantinos Karolidis or Karloglou was a wealthy landowner and wheat merchant. Like most Cappadocian Greeks (see Karamanlides), Karolidis' mother tongue was Ottoman Turkish, but he was educated at Greek schools, including two of the premier Greek-language institutions of the Ottoman Empire, the Great School of the Nation in Constantinople and the Evangelical School of Smyrna. In 1867 he enrolled in the School of Philosophy of the University of Athens, and in 1870 he went to Germany on a scholarship. He studied at the universities of Munich, Strasbourg and Tübingen and was awarded his doctorate in 1872. \n\nOn his return from Germany, he initially taught in the Greek high schools of Pera and Chalcedon. In 1876 he went to Smyrna to teach at the Evangelical School. There he remained until 1886, when he moved permanently to Athens in the independent Greek kingdom. After teaching in a high school for a few months, he was elected assistant professor of General History at the University of Athens. In 1893, he succeeded the dean of modern Greek historians, Constantine Paparrigopoulos, at the chair of Greek History. Initially, Karolidis pursued the idea of occupying a new seat for Oriental Studies, where he was more qualified, but his rivalry with Spyridon Lambros negated this prospect.\n\nAs he was still an Ottoman citizen, in 1908 Karolidis was elected to the Ottoman Parliament. His independent-mindedness during his tenure, especially with regards to his ardent anti-Slavic feelings and his hopes for a Greco-Turkish rapprochement, alienated him from the Greek authorities and those Ottoman Greeks who aligned themselves with the policies of the Greek kingdom. Disappointed, Karolidis initially thought to return to Athens and resume his university post, but in the event he was convinced to run as a candidate for the Committee of Union and Progress, the party of the Young Turks. This was seen as tantamount to treason by the nationalist Greek press, with rumours even spreading that he had converted to Islam. Karolidis was elected to the Parliament and remained in Constantinople until September 1912. As war between the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan League, to which Greece had acceded in May, became inevitable, he left for Germany. He returned to Greece only towards the end of the First Balkan War in May 1913.\n\nKarolidis resumed his teaching at the University of Athens only in September 1915. A convinced royalist, he supported King Constantine I during the National Schism, a fact which cost him his post following the victory of Eleftherios Venizelos and the king's abdication in June 1917. He was reinstated in early 1921, after Venizelos' electoral defeat, and kept his post until he was pensioned off in 1923. His political leanings changed abruptly in this period, following the Asia Minor Disaster, and he became fiercely critical towards the Greek monarchy. He died in Athens on 26 July 1930.\n\nKarolidis's initial research, during the 1870s and 1880s, was focused on his home region of Cappadocia, with the publication of \"Kappadokika, a historical and archaeological dissertation on Cappadocia\" in 1874 and his studies on the city of Comana and the Cappadocian Greek dialect published in 1882 and 1885 respectively.\n\nAlthough an eminent Orientalist, after his appointment to the University of Athens Karolidis largely neglected the field and instead turned to Greek and general history, in conformity with the chairs he held. He published 18 books and 38 articles in the period 1893–1908, including his three volume \"History of the 19th Century\", a three volume-work (plus the introductory \"Introduction\") which focuses on Greece, and his unfinished \"Universal or World History\", only four of whose projected ten volumes were completed. The latter work is of particular importance as it was one of the rare studies on the historical method written in Greek until then. He is also notable as the editor of the revised edition of Paparrigopoulos' \"History of the Greek Nation\", published in 1902–1903.\n\nThe period after the Balkan Wars was not very productive for Karolidis, but after 1922 he produced some of his most famous works, dealing with the post-Byzantine period of Greek history (Ottoman Greece and Modern Greece): the seven-volume \"Contemporary History\" (1922–1929) and the \"History of Greece\" (1925). The eighth volume of the \"Contemporary History\" was eventually published in 1932, incorporated in the sixth edition of Paparrigopoulos' \"History of the Greek Nation\".\n\n"}

Since it was inaugurated by Augustus with the end of the Final War of the Roman Republic, it is sometimes called the Pax Augusta. During this period of approximately 206 years (27 BC to AD 180), the Roman empire achieved its greatest territorial extent and its population reached a maximum of up to 70 million people – a third of the world’s population. According to Cassius Dio, the dictatorial reign of Commodus, later followed by the Year of the Five Emperors and the crisis of the third century, marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust\". \n\nThe Pax Romana is said to have been a \"miracle\" because prior to it there had never been peace for so many centuries in a given period of history. However, Walter Goffart wrote: \"The volume of the \"Cambridge Ancient History\" for the years A.D. 70–192 is called 'The Imperial Peace', but peace is not what one finds in its pages\". Arthur M. Eckstein writes that the period must be seen in contrast to the much more frequent warfare in the Roman Republic in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Eckstein also notes that the incipient Pax Romana appeared during the Republic, and that its temporal span varied with geographical region as well: \"Although the standard textbook dates for the Pax Romana, the famous “Roman Peace” in the Mediterranean, are 31 BC to AD 250, the fact is that the Roman Peace was emerging in large regions of the Mediterranean at a much earlier date: Sicily after 210 [BC], the Italian Peninsula after 200 [BC]; the Po Valley after 190 [BC]; most of the Iberian Peninsula after 133 [BC]; North Africa after 100 [BC]; and for ever longer stretches of time in the Greek East.\"\n\nThe first known record of the term \"Pax Romana\" appears in a writing by Seneca the Younger in 55 AD. The concept was highly influential, and the subject of theories and attempts to copy it in subsequent ages. Arnaldo Momigliano noted that \"\"Pax Romana\" is a simple formula for propaganda, but a difficult subject for research.\" In fact, the \"Pax Romana\" was broken by the First Jewish–Roman War, the Kitos War (also in Judea, 115–117), the Bar Kokhba Revolt (also known as the Third Jewish–Roman War), the Roman–Parthian War of 58–63, Trajan's Roman–Parthian War of 113, the Dacian Wars, various battles with Germanic tribes, including the Teutoburg Forest, and Boudica's war in Britain in AD 60 or 61.\n\nThe Pax Romana began when Octavian (Augustus) defeated Mark Antony and Cleopatra in the Battle of Actium on 2 September 31 BC and became Roman emperor. He became princeps, or \"first citizen\". Lacking a good precedent of successful one-man rule, Augustus created a junta of the greatest military magnates and stood as the front man. By binding together these leading magnates in a coalition, he eliminated the prospect of civil war. The Pax Romana was not immediate, despite the end of the civil wars, because fighting continued in Hispania and in the Alps. Nevertheless, Augustus closed the Gates of Janus (a ceremony indicating that Rome was at peace) three times, first in 29 BC and again in 25 BC. The third closure is undocumented, but Inez Scott Ryberg (1949) and Gaius Stern (2006) have persuasively dated the third closure to 13 BC with the commissioning of the Ara Pacis. At the time of the Ludi Saeculares in 17 BC the Concept of Peace was publicised, and in 13 BC was proclaimed when Augustus and Agrippa jointly returned from pacifying the provinces. The order to construct the Ara Pacis was no doubt part of this announcement.\n\nAugustus faced a problem making peace an acceptable mode of life for the Romans, who had been at war with one power or another continuously for 200 years. Romans regarded peace not as an absence of war, but the rare situation which existed when all opponents had been beaten down and lost the ability to resist. Augustus' challenge was to persuade Romans that the prosperity they could achieve in the absence of warfare was better for the Empire than the potential wealth and honor acquired when fighting a risky war. Augustus succeeded by means of skillful propaganda. Subsequent emperors followed his lead, sometimes producing lavish ceremonies to close the Gates of Janus, issuing coins with Pax on the reverse, and patronizing literature extolling the benefits of the Pax Romana.\n\nAfter Augustus' death in 14 AD, most of his successors as Roman emperors continued his politics. The last five emperors of the Pax Romana were considered the \"Five Good Emperors\".\n\nRoman trade in the Mediterranean increased during the Pax Romana. Romans sailed East to acquire silks, gems, onyx and spices. Romans benefited from large profits and incomes in the Roman empire were raised due to trade in the Mediterranean.\n\nAs the Pax Romana of the western world by Rome was largely contemporaneous to the Pax Sinica of the eastern world by Han China, long-distance travel and trade in Eurasian history was significantly stimulated during these eras.\n\nThe prominence of the concept of the \"Pax Romana\" led to historians coining variants of the term to describe other systems of relative peace that have been established, attempted, or argued to have existed. Some variants include:\n\nMore generically, the concept has been referred to as \"pax imperia\", (sometimes spelled as \"pax imperium\") meaning \"imperial peace\", or—less literally—\"hegemonic peace\". Raymond Aron notes that imperial peace—peace achieved through hegemony—sometimes, but not always—can become civil peace. As an example, the German Empire's imperial peace of 1871 (over its internal components like Saxony) slowly evolved into the later German state. As a counter-example, the imperial peace of Alexander the Great's empire dissolved because the Greek city states maintained their political identity and more importantly, embryos of their own armed forces. Aron notes that during the Pax Romana, the Jewish war was a reminder that the overlapping of the imperial institutions over the local ones did not erase them and the overlap was a source of tension and flare-ups. Aron summarizes that, \"In other words, \"imperial peace\" becomes civil peace insofar as the memory of the previously independent political units are effaced, insofar as individuals within a pacified zone feel themselves less united to the traditional or local community and more to the conquering state.\"\n\nThe concept of Pax Romana was highly influential, and attempts to imitate it occurred in the Byzantine Empire, and in the Christian West, where it morphed into the Peace and Truce of God (\"pax Dei\" and \"treuga Dei\"). A theoretician of the imperial peace during the Middle Ages was Dante Aligheri. Dante's works on the topic were analyzed at the beginning of the 20th century by William Mitchell Ramsay in the book \"The Imperial Peace; An Ideal in European History\" (1913).\n\n\n"}

It includes 72 archives of materials dating back to 1799. The materials include the archives and library of Georgi Plekhanov, a prominent figure in the Russian political history as a propagandist of Marxism and the founder of Russian social democratic movement. It also included the manuscripts of- and about numerous other figures in Russian history, politics and intellectual life.\n\nPlekhanov House contains a large collection of materials on Russian and foreign history, on the Russian and international revolutionary movements and social history, on education, culture, secular and religious education, and so on. It includes collections of a number of authors from Russian history and from theological sources. The heart of the collection, however, is the over 5,000 items of storage that include original materials from Plekhanov's own collection.\n\nOver the years, Plekhanov House has published a number of works including the 24 volumes of Plekhanov's \"Collected Works\", a 5 volume set of \"Selected Philosophical Works\", and other works.\n\nAfter Georgi Plekhanov's death in 1918, the Soviet government, at the initiative of Vladimir Lenin, went to Rosalie Plekhanova with a proposal to start publishing the works of her late husband and set up an Archive. It was only in 1925 that Rosalie Plekhanova agreed to this proposal and presented the thinker's library of works and archive to the Soviet Union after refusing various individuals and research institutions, like Musée Social and Institut des Études Slaves, that offered to acquire or temporary house his collections in Prague or in some West European archive institution.\n\nPlekhanov has resided in Switzerland and Italy from 1880 until 1917 and Finland, where he died in 1918, and parts of his collection, which included authentic manuscripts, extensive correspondence, and voluminous library, were temporarily accommodated by institutions in Geneva and San Remo. It is not clear if his wife's reticence was due to Plekhanov's differences with Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Rosalie Plekhanova maintained that she regarded the archives and library as relics of her husband's work but finally entrusted all his possessions to the state for purposes of the promotion and dissemination of his works. According to Plekhanov House:\nPlekhanov had always considered the Petersburg Public Library as his \"Alma Mater\", a spiritual source of theoretical and practical knowledge he resorted to during the early stages of his scholarly and revolutionary activities. Plekhanov's heirs presented his archives and private library together with the furniture of his study in Geneva to the Soviet Union on the condition of integral hold in the Public Library in Leningrad as an organizational unit in a separate area with specialized research staff.The opening ceremony of Plekhanov House took place on 11 June 1929, following the donation of the archives and library of Georgi Plekhanov by his widow, Rosalie Plekhanova, to the Soviet Union in 1925. As noted in the \"Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science, \"\"It was organized and headed by Rosalia Plekhanov-Bograd, the widow of the founder of Russian Marxism, and immediately became the most important centre of the scholarly analysis of the theoretical legacy left by that prominent thinker.\n\n"}

{"id": "5395098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5395098", "title": "Supposition theory", "text": "Supposition theory\n\nSupposition theory was a branch of medieval logic that was probably aimed at giving accounts of issues similar to modern accounts of reference, plurality, tense, and modality, within an Aristotelian context. Philosophers such as John Buridan, William of Ockham, William of Sherwood, Walter Burley, Albert of Saxony, and Peter of Spain were its principal developers. By the 14th century it seems to have drifted into at least two fairly distinct theories, the theory of \"supposition proper\" which included an \"ampliation\" and is much like a theory of reference, and the theory of \"modes of supposition\" whose intended function is not clear.\n\nSupposition was a semantic relation between a term and what it is being used to talk about.\nSo, for example, in the suggestion \"Drink another cup\" the term \"cup\" is suppositing for the wine contained in the cup.\n\nThe logical \"suppositum\" of a term was the object the term referred to. (In grammar, \"suppositum\" was used in a different way). However, supposition was a different semantic relationship than signification. Signification was a conventional relationship between utterances and objects mediated by the particularities of a language. \"Poculum\" signifies in Latin, what \"cup\" signifies in English. Signification is the imposition of a meaning on an utterance, but supposition is taking a meaningful term as standing in for something. According to Peter of Spain \"Hence signification is prior to supposition. Neither do they belong to the same thing. For to signify belongs to an utterance, but to supposit belongs to a term already, as it were, put together out of an utterance and a signification.\" An easy way to see the difference is in our \"drink another cup\" example. Here \"cup\" as an utterance signifies a cup as an object, but \"cup\" as a term of the language English is being used to supposit for the wine contained in the cup.\n\nMedieval logicians divided supposition into many different kinds, and the jargons for the different kinds, and their relations and what they all mean get complex, and differ greatly from logician to logician. Paul Spade's webpage has a series of helpful diagrams here. The most important division is probably between material, simple, personal, and improper supposition. A term supposits materially, when it is used to stand in for an utterance or inscription, rather than for what it signifies. When I say \"Cup is a monosyllabic word,\" I am using the word \"cup\" to supposit materially for the utterance \"cup\" rather than for a piece of pottery. Material supposition is a medieval way of doing the work we would do today by using quotation marks. According to Ockham (\"Summa of Logic\" I64, 8) \"Simple supposition occurs when a term supposits for an intention of the soul, but is not take significatively.\" The idea is that simple supposition happens when the term is standing in for a human concept rather than for the object itself. If I say \"Cups are an important type of pottery\" the term \"cups\" is not standing in for any particular cup, but for the idea of a cup in the human mind (according to Ockham, and many medieval logicians, but not according to John Buridan). Personal supposition in contrast is when the term supposits for what it signifies. If I say \"Pass me the cup\" the term \"cup\" is standing in for the object that is called a \"cup\" in English, so it is in personal supposition. A term is in improper supposition, if it is suppositing for an object, but a different object than it signifies, as in my example \"Drink another cup.\"\n\nPersonal supposition was further divided in types such as discrete, determinate, merely confused, and confused and distributive. In 1966 T.K. Scott proposed giving a separate name for Medieval discussions of the subvarieties of personal supposition, because he thought it was a fairly distinct issue from the other varieties of supposition. He proposed calling the subvarieties of personal supposition a theory of \"modes of supposition.\"\n\nThe Medieval logicians give elaborate sets of syntactical rules for determining when a term supposits discretely, determinately, confusedly, or confusedly and distributively. So for example the subject of a negative claim, or indefinite one supposits determinately, but the subject of a singular claim supposits discretely, while the subject of an affirmative claim supposits confusedly and determinately. Albert of Saxony gives 15 rules for determining which type of personal supposition a term is using. Further the medieval logicians did not seem to dispute about the details of the syntactic rules for determining type of personal supposition. These rules seem to be important because they were linked to theories of descent to particulars and ascent from particulars.\n\nWhen I say \"I want to buy a cup\" I've made an indefinite affirmative claim, with \"cup\" as the predicate term. Further cup is a common term, including many particular cups within it. So if I \"descend to particulars\" I can re-phrase my claim as \"I want to buy this cup or I want to buy that cup, or I want to buy that other cup - and so on for all cups.\" If I had an infinite disjunction of all particular cups, it could stand in for the term cup, in its simple supposition in \"I want to buy a cup.\" This is called determinate supposition. That is when I say \"I want to buy a cup\" I mean some determinate cup, but I don't necessarily know which one yet. Likewise if I say \"Some cup isn't a table,\" I could substitute \"This cup isn't a table, or that cup isn't a table or ...\"\n\nOn the other hand, if I say \"No cup is a table\", I don't mean \"This cup isn't a table or that one isn't a table or ...\" I mean \"This cup isn't a table, AND that cup isn't a table, AND that other cup isn't a table, AND ...\". Here I am referring not to a determinate particular cup, but to all cups \"fused\" together, that is all cups \"confusedly.\" This is called confused and distributive supposition.\n\nIf I say \"This cup is made of gold\" I cannot descend to a disjunction of particulars, or to a conjunction of particulars, but only because \"this cup\" is already a particular. This kind of personal supposition is called discrete supposition.\n\nHowever, the predicate of a universal affirmative claim won't really fit any of these models. \"All coffee cups are cups\" does not imply \"All coffee cups are this cup, or all coffee cups are that cup, or ...\", but still less does it imply \"All coffee cups are this cup, and all coffee cups are that cup, and ...\". On the other hand, if it happened to be the case that there was only one coffee cup left in the world, it would be true that \"All coffee cups are that cup\", so I can validly infer from \"All coffee cups are that cup\", to \"All coffee cups are cups\". Here descent to disjunction fails, and descent to conjunction fails, but \"ascent from particulars\" is valid. This is called \"merely confused supposition.\"\n\nThat is basically how the theory works, a much thornier problem is exactly what the theory is for. Some commentators, like Michael Loux, have suggested that the theory of ascent and descent to particulars is intended to provide truth conditions for the quantifiers. T. K. Scott has suggested that the theory of supposition proper was designed to answer the question \"What kind of thing are you talking about?\" but the theory of personal supposition was aimed at answering the question \"How many of them are you talking about?\" Paul Spade has suggested that by the 14th century the theory of modes of personal supposition wasn't aimed at anything at all anymore.\n\nWhen I say \"No cups are made of lead\", \"cups\" supposits for all the cups that exist. But if I say \"Some cups were made of lead in Roman times\", \"cups\" cannot just be suppositing for all the cups that exist, but for cups in the past as well. Here I am expanding the normal supposition of the terms I use. Peter of Spain says \"Ampliation is the extension of a common term from a lesser supposition to a greater one.\" In practice, if I speak of the past, or the future, or make a modal claim, the terms I use get ampliated to supposit for past things, future things, or possible things, rather than their usual supposition for present actual things. Thus, ampliation becomes the medieval theory for explaining modal and tense logics within the theory of supposition.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "65811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65811", "title": "Thebes, Egypt", "text": "Thebes, Egypt\n\nThebes (, \"Thēbai\"), known to the ancient Egyptians as Waset, was an ancient Egyptian city located east of the Nile about south of the Mediterranean. Its ruins lie within the modern Egyptian city of Luxor. Thebes was the main city of the fourth Upper Egyptian nome (Sceptre nome) and was the capital of Egypt mainly during the Middle Kingdom and the New Kingdom. It was close to Nubia and the Eastern Desert, with its valuable mineral resources and trade routes. It was a cult center and the most venerated city of ancient Egypt during its heyday. The site of Thebes includes areas on both the eastern bank of the Nile, where the temples of Karnak and Luxor stand and the city proper was situated; and the western bank, where a necropolis of large private and royal cemeteries and funerary complexes can be found.\nThe Egyptian name for Thebes was \"wꜣs.t\", \"City of the \"wꜣs\"\", the sceptre of the pharaohs, a long staff with an animal's head and a forked base. From the end of the New Kingdom, Thebes was known in Egyptian as , the \"City of Amun\", the chief of the Theban Triad of deities whose other members were Mut and Khonsu. This name of Thebes appears in the Bible as the () in the Book of Nahum and also as \"No\" () mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel and Jeremiah.\n\nThebes is the latinised form of , the hellenized form of the Demotic Egyptian \"ta Pe\", from earlier \"ta Opet\". This was the local name not for the city itself but for the Karnak temple complex on the northeast bank of the city. As early as Homer's \"Iliad\", the Greeks distinguished the Egyptian Thebes as (, \"Thēbai hekatómpyloi\") or \"Hundred-Gated Thebes\", as opposed to the \"Thebes of the Seven Gates\" (, \"Thēbai heptapyloi\") in Boeotia, Greece.\n\nIn the \"interpretatio graeca\", Amun was rendered as Zeus Ammon. The name was therefore translated into Greek as Diospolis, \"City of Zeus\". To distinguish it from the numerous other cities by this name, it was known as the (, \"Dióspolis Megálē\"; ). The Greek names came into wider use after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, when the country came to be ruled by the Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty.\n\nThebes was located along the banks of the Nile River in the middle part of Upper Egypt about 800 km from the Delta. It was built largely on the alluvial plains of the Nile Valley which follows a great bend of the Nile. As a natural consequence, the city was laid in a northeast-southwest axis parallel to the contemporary river channel. Thebes had an area of 93 km (36 sq mi) which included parts of the Theban Hills in the west that culminates at the sacred 420-meter (1,378-foot) al-Qurn. In the east lies the mountainous Eastern Desert with its wadis draining into the valley. Significant among these wadis is Wadi Hammamat near Thebes. It was used as an overland trade route going to the Red Sea coast.\n\nIn the fourth Upper Egyptian nome, Thebes was found to have neighboring towns such as Per-Hathor, Madu, Djerty, Iuny, Sumenu and Imiotru.\n\nAccording to George Modelski, Thebes had about 40,000 inhabitants in 2000 BC (compared to 60,000 in Memphis, the largest city of the world at the time). By 1800 BC, the population of Memphis was down to about 30,000, making Thebes the largest city in Egypt at the time. Historian Ian Morris estimated that by 1500 BC, Thebes may have grown to be the largest city in the world, with a population of about 75,000, a position which it held until about 900 BC, when it was surpassed by Nimrud (among others).\n\nThe archaeological remains of Thebes offer a striking testimony to Egyptian civilization at its height. The Greek poet Homer extolled the wealth of Thebes in the \"Iliad\", Book 9 (c. 8th Century BC): \"... in Egyptian Thebes the heaps of precious ingots gleam, the hundred-gated Thebes.\"\n\nMore than sixty annual festivals were celebrated in Thebes. The major festivals among these according to the Edfu Geographical Text were: the Beautiful Feast of Opet, the Khoiak (Festival), Festival of I Shemu, and Festival of II Shemu. Another popular festivity was the halloween-like Beautiful Festival of the Valley.\n\nThebes was inhabited from around 3200 BC. It was the eponymous capital of Waset, the fourth Upper Egyptian nome. At this time it was still a small trading post while Memphis served as the royal residence of Old Kingdom pharaohs. Although no buildings survive in Thebes older than the portions of the Karnak temple complex, which may date from the Middle Kingdom, the lower part of a statue of Pharaoh Nyuserre of the 5th Dynasty has been found in Karnak. Another statue which was dedicated by the 12th Dynasty king Senusret may have been usurped and re-used, since the statue bears a cartouche of Nyuserre on its belt. Since seven rulers of the 4th to 6th Dynasties appear on the Karnak king list, perhaps at the least there was a temple in the Theban area which dated to the Old Kingdom.\n\nBy 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs (the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties) consolidated Lower Egypt and northern parts of Upper Egypt from their capital in Herakleopolis Magna. A rival line (the Eleventh Dynasty) based at Thebes ruled the remaining part of Upper Egypt. The Theban rulers were apparently descendants of the prince of Thebes, Intef the Elder. His probable grandson Intef I was the first of the family to claim in life a partial pharaonic titulary, though his power did not extend much further than the general Theban region.\n\nFinally by c. 2050 BC, Intef III's son Mentuhotep II (meaning \"Montu is satisfied\"), took the Herakleopolitans by force and reunited Egypt once again under one ruler, thereby starting the period now known as the \"Middle Kingdom\". Mentuhotep II ruled for 51 years and built the first mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri, which most likely served as the inspiration for the later and larger temple built next to it by Hatshepsut in the 18th Dynasty. After these events, the 11th Dynasty was short-lived, as less than 20 years had elapsed between the death of Mentuhotep II and that of Mentuhotep IV, in mysterious circumstances.\n\nDuring the 12th Dynasty, Amenemhat I moved the seat of power North to Itjtawy. Thebes continued to thrive as a religious center as the local god Amun was increasingly becoming prominent throughout Egypt. The oldest remains of a temple dedicated to Amun date to the reign of Senusret I. Thebes was already, in the Middle Kingdom a town of considerable size. Excavations around the Karnak temple show that the Middle Kingdom town had the layout with a grid pattern. The city was at least one kilometer long and 50 hectares in area. Remains of two palatial buildings were also detected.\n\nStarting in the later part of the 12th Dynasty, a group of Canaanite people began settling in the eastern Nile Delta. They eventually founded the 14th Dynasty at Avaris in c. 1805 BC or c. 1710 BC. By doing so, the Asiatics established hegemony over the majority of the Delta region, subtracting these territories from the influence of the 13th Dynasty that had meanwhile succeeded the 12th.\n\nA second wave of Asiatics called Hyksos (from \"Heqa-khasut\", \"rulers of foreign lands\" as Egyptians called their leaders) immigrated into Egypt and overran the Canaanite center of power at Avaris, starting the 15th Dynasty there. The Hyksos kings gained the upper hand over Lower Egypt early into the Second Intermediate Period (1657-1549 BC). When the Hyksos took Memphis during or shortly after Merneferre Ay's reign (c. 1700 BC), the rulers of the 13th Dynasty fled south to Thebes, which was restored as capital.\n\nTheban princes (now known as the 16th Dynasty) firmly stood over their immediate region as the Hyksos advanced from the Delta southwards to Middle Egypt. The Thebans resisted the Hyksos' further advance by forming an agreement for a peaceful concurrent rule between them. The Hyksos were able to sail upstream past Thebes and some Nile cataracts to trade with the Nubians and the Thebans brought their herds to the Delta without adversaries. The status quo continued until Hyksos ruler Apophis (15th Dynasty) insulted Seqenenre Tao (17th Dynasty) of Thebes. Soon the armies of Thebes marched on the Hyksos-ruled lands. Tao died in battle and his son Kamose took charge of the campaign. After Kamose's death, his brother Ahmose I continued till he captured Avaris, the Hyksos capital. Ahmose I drove the Hyksos out of Egypt and the Levant and reclaimed the lands formerly ruled by them.\n\nAhmose I founded a new age for a unified Egypt with Thebes as its capital. The city remained as capital during most of the 18th Dynasty (New Kingdom). It also became the center for a newly established professional civil service, where there was a greater demand for scribes and the literate as the royal archives began to fill with accounts and reports. At the city the favored few of \nNubia were reeducated with Egyptian culture, to serve as administrators of the colony.\n\nWith Egypt stabilized again, religion and religious centers flourished and none more so than Thebes. For instance, Amenhotep III, poured much of his vast wealth from foreign tribute into the temples of Amun. The Theban god Amun became a principal state deity and every building project sought to outdo the last in proclaiming the glory of Amun and the pharaohs themselves. Thutmose I (reigned 1506-1493 BC) began the first great expansion of the Karnak temple. After this, colossal enlargements of the temple became the norm throughout the New Kingdom.\n\nQueen Hatshepsut (reigned 1479-1458 BC) made the Theban economy flourish by renewing trade networks, primarily the Red Sea trade between Thebes' Red Sea port of Al-Qusayr, Elat and the land of Punt. Her successor Thutmose III brought to Thebes a great deal of his war booty that originated from as far as Mittani. The 18th Dynasty reached its peak during his great-grandson Amenhotep III's reign (1388–1350 BC). Aside from embellishing the temples of Amun, Amenhotep increased construction in Thebes to unprecedented levels. On the west bank, he built the enormous mortuary temple and the equally massive Malkata palace-city which fronted a 364-hectare artificial lake. In the city proper he built the Luxor temple and the Avenue of the Sphinxes leading to Karnak.\n\nFor a brief period in the reign of Amenhotep III's son Akhenaten (1351–1334 BC), Thebes fell on evil times; the city was abandoned by the court, and the worship of Amun was proscribed. The capital was moved to the new city of Amarna (Akhetaten), midway between Thebes and Memphis. After his death, his son Tutankhamun made a return to Memphis, but renewed interest in building projects at Thebes which produced even more glorious temples and shrines.\n\nWith the 19th Dynasty the seat of government moved to the Delta. Thebes maintained its revenues and prestige through the reigns of Seti I (1290–1279 BC) and Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC), who still resided for part of every year in Thebes. Ramesses II carried out extensive building projects in the city such as statues and obelisks, the third enclosure wall of Karnak temple, additions to the Luxor temple, and the Ramesseum, his grand mortuary temple. The constructions were bankrolled by the large granaries (built around the Ramesseum) which concentrated the taxes collected from Upper Egypt; and by the gold from expeditions to Nubia and the Eastern Desert. Under Ramesses' long 66-year reign, Egypt and Thebes reached an overwhelming state of prosperity which equaled or even surpassed the earlier peak under Amenhotep III.\n\nThe city continued to be well kept in the early 20th Dynasty. The Great Harris Papyrus states that Ramesses III (reigned 1187–56) donated 86,486 slaves and vast estates to the temples of Amun. Ramesses III received tributes from all subject peoples including the Sea Peoples and Meshwesh Libyans. However, the whole of Egypt was experiencing financial problems, exemplified in the events at Thebes' village of Deir el-Medina. In the 25th year of his reign, workers in Deir el-Medina began striking for pay and there arose a general unrest of all social classes. Consequently, an unsuccessful harem revolt led to the deaths of many, including Theban officials and women.\n\nUnder the later Ramessids, Thebes began to decline; the government fell into grave economic difficulties. During the reign of Ramesses IX (1129–1111 BC), about 1114 BC, a series of investigations into the plundering of royal tombs in the necropolis of western Thebes uncovered proof of corruption in high places, following an accusation made by the mayor of the east bank against his colleague on the west. The plundered royal mummies were moved from place to place and at last deposited by the priests of Amun in a tomb-shaft in Deir el-Bahri and in the tomb of Amenhotep II. (The finding of these two hiding places in 1881 and 1898, respectively, was one of the great events of modern archaeological discovery.) Such maladministration in Thebes led to unrest.\n\nControl of local affairs tended to come more and more into the hands of the High Priests of Amun, so that during the Third Intermediate Period, the High Priest of Amun exerted absolute power over the South, a counterbalance to the 21st and 22nd Dynasty kings who ruled from the Delta. Intermarriage and adoption strengthened the ties between them, daughters of the Tanite kings being installed as God’s Wife of Amun at Thebes, where they wielded greater power. Theban political influence receded only in the Late Period.\n\nBy around 750 BC, the Kushites (Nubians) were growing their influence over Thebes and Upper Egypt. Kush, the former colony of Egypt became an empire in itself. In 721 BC, King Shabaka of the Kushites defeated the combined forces of Osorkon IV (22nd Dynasty), Peftjauawybast (23rd Dynasty) Bakenranef (24th Dynasty) and reunified Egypt yet again. His reign saw a significant amount of building work undertaken throughout Egypt, especially at the city of Thebes, which he made the capital of his kingdom. In Karnak he erected a pink granite statue of himself wearing the Pschent (the double crown of Egypt). Taharqa accomplished many notable projects at Thebes (i.e. the Kiosk in Karnak) and Nubia before the Assyrians started to wage war against Egypt.\n\nIn 667 BC, attacked by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal's army, Taharqa abandoned Lower Egypt and fled to Thebes. After his death three years later his nephew (or cousin) Tantamani seized Thebes, invaded Lower Egypt and laid siege to Memphis, but abandoned his attempts to conquer the country in 663 BC and retreated southwards. The Assyrians pursued him and took Thebes, whose name was added to a long list of cities plundered and destroyed by the Assyrians, as Ashurbanipal wrote:\n\"This city, the whole of it, I conquered it with the help of Ashur and Ishtar. Silver, gold, precious stones, all the wealth of the palace, rich cloth, precious linen, great horses, supervising men and women, two obelisks of splendid electrum, weighing 2,500 talents, the doors of temples I tore from their bases and carried them off to Assyria. With this weighty booty I left Thebes. Against Egypt and Kush I have lifted my spear and shown my power. With full hands I have returned to Nineveh, in good health.\"\nThebes never regained its former political significance, but it remained an important religious centre. Assyrians installed Psamtik I (664-610 BC), who ascended to Thebes in 656 BC and brought about the adoption of his own daughter, Nitocris I, as heiress to God's Wife of Amun there. In 525 BC, Persian Cambyses II invaded Egypt and became pharaoh, subordinating the kingdom as a satrapy to the greater Achaemenid Empire.\n\nThe good relationship of the Thebans with the central power in the North ended when the native Egyptian pharaohs were finally replaced by Greeks, led by Alexander the Great. He visited Thebes during a celebration of the Opet Festival. In spite of his welcoming visit, Thebes became a center for dissent. Towards the end of the third century BC, Hugronaphor (Horwennefer), possibly of Nubian origin, led a revolt against the Ptolemies in Upper Egypt. His successor, Ankhmakis, held large parts of Upper Egypt until 185 BC. This revolt was supported by the Theban priesthood. After the suppression of the revolt in 185 BC, Ptolemy V, in need of the support of the priesthood, forgave them.\n\nHalf a century later the Thebans rose again, elevating a certain Harsiesi to the throne in 132 BC. Harsiesi, having helped himself to the funds of the royal bank at Thebes, fled the following year. In 91 BC, another revolt broke out. In the following years, Thebes was subdued, and the city turned into rubble.\n\nDuring the Roman occupation (30 BC-349 AD), the remaining communities clustered around the pylon of the Luxor temple. Thebes became part of the Roman province of \"Thebais\", which later split into \"Thebais Superior\", centered at the city, and \"Thebais Inferior\", centered at Ptolemais Hermiou. A Roman legion was headquartered in Luxor temple at the time of Roman campaigns in Nubia. Building did not come to an abrupt stop, but the city continued to decline. In the first century AD, Strabo described Thebes as having been relegated to a mere village.\n\nEastern Thebes:\n\nWestern Thebes:\n\nIn 1979, the ruins of ancient Thebes were classified by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage site. The two great temples—Luxor Temple and Karnak—and the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens are among the great achievements of ancient Egypt.\n\nFrom 25 October 2018 to 27 January 2019, the Museum of Grenoble organizes with the support of the Louvre and the British Museum, a three-month exhibition on the city of Thebes and the role of women in the city at that time.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

In 1879, he became involved in the printing business which became T and A Constable of Edinburgh. He would work with the firm for almost fifty years, and for many years he ran it.\n\nHe became one of the leading scholars of the Jacobite period, especially of the life of Bonnie Prince Charlie.\n\nIn 1897 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposers being John George Bartholomew, Sir John Murray, Frederick Bailey and Hugh Robert Mill.

The text was geared particularly toward Rabbinic leadership. \n\nWessely wished to convince the Rabbinic authorities that the spread of secular education would be to the benefit of the Jewish community, and was not something that they should fear. He essentially differentiated between two different kinds of knowledge: \"Torat Ha-Elohim\" (divine, or religious knowledge) and \"Torat Ha-Adam\" (human, or secular knowledge). While both components are necessary, Wessely argued that the acquisition of secular education must precede the acquisition of divine knowledge; ultimately, secular learning is a universal body of knowledge which is to be supplemented by the religious instruction of the Torah.\n\nIn many ways, Wessely’s reprioritization of education was contrary to traditional Jewish practice. The study of secular subjects first and the Torah second seemed repugnant to many rabbis, who denounced the work in harsh terms. In Vilna, the book was burned publicly; however in Italy and other places, it was applauded as an enlightened and legitimate work.\n\n"}
{"id": "21607397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21607397", "title": "World Series ring", "text": "World Series ring\n\nA World Series ring is an award given to Major League Baseball players who win the World Series. Since only one Commissioner's Trophy is awarded to the team, a World Series ring is an individual award that players and staff of each World Series champion team get to keep for themselves to symbolize the victory. World Series rings are uniquely commissioned by the winning team each year and presented to deserving players and staff early in the next season. The rings have been made by companies that include Jostens, Tiffany & Co., Dieges & Clust, and L.G. Balfour Company.\nThe first World Series ring was given to members of the New York Giants after winning the 1922 World Series. By the 1930s, each winning team gave their players a ring. Though the ring started off simple, usually containing only one diamond, rings over time have become more elaborate and ornate, with the 2003 World Series ring containing over 200 diamonds.\n\nIn addition to their inherent value, World Series rings also carry additional value as sports memorabilia. A World Series ring belonging to Casey Stengel sold for $180,000. Lenny Dykstra's 1986 World Series ring sold for over $56,000 during his bankruptcy proceedings. Other rings sold in auctions have sold for over $10,000 apiece. Replica rings given to fans have sold for as much as $300.\n\nPrior to the 1922 World Series, players on the World Series-winning team were given keepsakes, such as a pin or pocketwatch fob. The first World Series ring was given to the members of the New York Giants following their victory in the 1922 World Series over the New York Yankees. When the Yankees won the 1923 World Series, players were given a commemorative pocketwatch. The Yankees first gave rings to their players following the 1927 World Series. Rings became an annual tradition in the 1930s, as every World Series-winning team has given rings to its players since 1932. In past years, players often requested other items in place of rings, including cufflinks and tie clips. Frankie Crosetti and Tommy Henrich requested shotguns from the Yankees following World Series championships. Grover Cleveland Alexander reportedly pawned his 1926 World Series ring.\n\nMembers of the 1973 World Series champion Oakland Athletics were upset when team owner Charlie O. Finley, following salary disputes with his players, presented his team with rings that were identical to the ones received after winning the 1972 World Series, except without the one-carat diamond. Reggie Jackson referred to them as \"trash rings\". The first ring to contain more than one diamond was the 1977 World Series ring commissioned by the Yankees, which had over a dozen diamonds. Over time, ring designs have become larger and more elaborate, with Yogi Berra saying in 2009, \"They're so much bigger now, they're like weapons. You can't even wear them.\" Whereas older rings were 10 carat and between 20 and 25 pennyweight, modern rings are typically 14 carat and 50 pennyweight. The rings commissioned by the Florida Marlins after the 2003 World Series are believed to be among the most expensive World Series rings ever made; made of 14-carat white gold, the ring featured 229 diamonds, including one teal diamond, and 13 rubies. The rings cost $20,000 apiece due to the quantity of the purchase, though they retailed at $40,000 each. After breaking their long championship drought in 2016, the Chicago Cubs commissioned rings said to be worth up to $70,000, consisting of 214 diamonds at 5.5 karats, 3 karats of rubies, and 2.5 karats of sapphires.\n\nTeams have also increasingly added distinctive touches to make their rings unique from previous versions. For their 2007 World Series rings, the Boston Red Sox commissioned a special version for players who were on both the 2004 and 2007 championship teams, and for 2013, they included the Boston Strong logo on the side. The St. Louis Cardinals had the Rally Squirrel engraved into their 2011 World Series championship rings. For their 2014 World Series rings, the San Francisco Giants included three diamonds on the top bezel and five on the bottom, representing their three titles in five years, and eight championships overall. The 2016 World Series rings for the Chicago Cubs each contain 108 diamonds around the bezel, one for each year that the team went without a championship, and also include an image of a goat on the inner band. Companies that have been commissioned to create World Series rings include Jostens, Tiffany & Co., Dieges & Clust, and the L.G. Balfour Company.\n\nPlayers typically receive their rings in pregame ceremonies early in the next season. Since the rings are commissioned by the team, many non-players affiliated with the team, including front office executives, coaches, scouts, broadcasters, locker room staff, and groundskeepers also receive rings at the team's discretion. After the 2004 World Series, the Red Sox ordered over 500 rings; the Cardinals commissioned 400 rings in 2006; and the Kansas City Royals distributed about 700 rings after their 2015 title. Players who were only briefly on the team's roster during a championship season and those no longer affiliated with the winning team also often receive rings. Arthur Rhodes, Bengie Molina, and Lonnie Smith played in the World Series against a team they played for earlier in the season, guaranteeing them World Series rings regardless of the series outcome. As both the physical size and number of rings given out has increased, teams have started producing both \"A\" and \"B\" versions, and sometimes \"C\" versions, that are similar in appearance but smaller in size and use cheaper materials. The most expensive \"A\" rings are typically reserved for full-time players, coaches, and executives, while bit players and other team employees receive the cheaper \"B\" and \"C\" rings.\n\nIn modern years, the importance of World Series rings to players has increased. Alex Rodriguez said his 2009 World Series ring \"means the world\" to him, and that he would wear it daily. Sergio Romo of the 2010 World Series champion San Francisco Giants said of his ring: \"In all reality, this is why we play right here.\" Jon Jay said his 2011 World Series ring \"...represents last year and all the hard work. Ever since I was a kid I dreamed of something like this.\" Former player and current Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper said, \"It's not a hug. It's not a handshake. It's not a pat on the back. It's a ring. It's the one thing every professional athlete wants: something they can hold onto, something they can show off.\" Players' names and uniform numbers are often individually inscribed in their ring. Many players prefer to display their rings as trophies as opposed to wearing them.\n\nWorld Series rings are considered valuable sports memorabilia. In 2007, Casey Stengel's 1951 World Series ring sold for $180,000. When Lenny Dykstra went through bankruptcy in 2009, his 1986 World Series ring sold for $56,762.50 through Heritage Auctions, three times as much as was expected. Others have sold their rings on eBay. Doug Baker of the 1984 World Series champion Detroit Tigers had a new ring made after his original was stolen, and when he recovered the original ring, he sold it for $12,322. Cucho Rodriguez, a scout for the Red Sox, sold his 2004 World Series ring for over $53,000 and in 2011, Scott Williamson auctioned off his 2004 ring for $89,000. More recently, Willie Stargell's 1979 World Series ring was sold at auction for over $82,000. However, the ring that once belonged to disgraced pitcher Brandon Puffer, when offered for sale on the August 15, 2013, episode of \"Pawn Stars\" could not be sold. The shop declined to make an offer, claiming Puffer's off-field problems destroyed the resale value of the ring.\n\nThe National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum contains an exhibit on World Series rings. The New York Yankees Museum, located in Yankee Stadium, has an exhibit with replicas of all Yankees' World Series rings, including the pocket watch given after the 1923 World Series. Yogi Berra won the most World Series rings with 10, as a player. Frankie Crosetti won 17 as a player and as a coach. Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15533", "title": "Zionist political violence", "text": "Zionist political violence\n\nZionist political violence or refers to acts of violence or terror committed by Zionists.\n\nActions have been carried out by individuals and Jewish paramilitary groups such as the Irgun, the Lehi, the Haganah and the Palmach as part of a conflict between Jews, British authorities, and Palestinian Arabs, regarding land, immigration, and control over Palestine.\n\nBritish soldiers and officials, United Nations personnel, Palestinian Arab fighters and civilians, and Jewish fighters and civilians have been targets or victims of these actions. Domestic, commercial, and government property, infrastructure, and material have also been attacked.\n\nDuring World War I, Zionist volunteers fought in the Jewish Legion of the British Army against the Ottoman Turks\n\nDuring the 1920 Nebi Musa riots, the 1921 Jaffa riots and the 1929 Palestine riots, Palestinian Arabs manifested hostility against zionist immigration, which provoked the reaction of Jewish militias. In 1935, the Irgun, a Zionist underground military organization, split off from the Haganah. The Irgun were the armed expression of the nascent ideology of Revisionist Zionism founded by Ze'ev Jabotinsky. He expressed this ideology as \"every Jew had the right to enter Palestine; only active retaliation would deter the Arab and the British; only Jewish armed force would ensure the Jewish state\".\n\nDuring the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, Palestinian Arabs fought for the end of the Mandate and the creation of an Arab state based on the whole of Palestine. They attacked both British and Jews as well as some Palestinian Arabs who supported a Pan-Arabism. Mainstream Zionists, represented by the Vaad Leumi and the Haganah, practiced the policy of Havlagah (restraint), while Irgun militants did not follow this policy and called themselves \"Havlagah breakers.\" The Irgun began bombing Palestinian Arab civilian targets in 1938. While the Palestinian Arabs were \"carefully disarmed\" by the British Mandatory authorities by 1939, the Zionists were not.\n\nAfter the beginning of World War II, the Haganah and Irgun suspended their activity against the British in support of their war against Nazi Germany. The smaller Lehi continued anti-British attacks and direct action throughout the war. At that time, the British also supported the creation and the training of Palmach, as a unit that could withstand a German offensive in the area, with the consent of Yishuv which saw an opportunity to get trained units and soldiers for the planned Jewish state and during 1944–1945, the most mainstream Jewish paramilitary organization, Haganah, cooperated with the British authorities against the Lehi and Etzel.\n\nAfter World War II, between 1945 and the 29 November 1947 Partition vote, British soldiers and policemen were targeted by Irgun and Lehi. Haganah and Palmah first collaborated with the British against them, particularly during the Hunting Season, before actively joining them in the Jewish Resistance Movement, then finally choosing an official neutral position after 1946 while the Irgun and the Lehi went on their attacks against the British.\n\nThe Haganah carried out violent attacks in Palestine, such as the liberation of interned immigrants from the Atlit camp, the bombing of the country's railroad network, sabotage raids on radar installations and bases of the British Palestine police. It also continued to organize illegal immigration.\n\nIn February 1947, the British announced that they would end the mandate and withdraw from Palestine and they asked the arbitration of the United Nations. After the vote of the Partition Plan for Palestine on 30 November 1947, civil war broke out in Palestine. Jewish and Arab communities fought each other violently in campaigns of attacks, retaliations and counter-retaliations which provoked around 800 deaths after two months. Arab volunteers entered Palestine to fight alongside the Palestinian Arabs. In April, 6 weeks before the termination of the Mandate, the Jewish militias launched wide operations to control the territory dedicated to them by the Partition Plan. Many atrocities occurred during this time. The Arab population in the mixed cities of Tiberias, Safed, Haifa, Jaffa, Beisan and Acre and in the neighbouring villages fled or were expelled during this period. During the Battle for Jerusalem (1948) where the Jewish community of 100,000 people was besieged, most Arab villages of the Tel Aviv – Jerusalem corridor were captured by Jewish militias and leveled.\n\nAt the beginning of the civil war, the Jewish militias organized several bombing attacks against civilians and military Arab targets. On 12 December, Irgun placed a car bomb opposite the Damascus Gate, killing 20 people. On 4 January 1948, the Lehi detonated a lorry bomb against the headquarters of the paramilitary Najjada located in Jaffa's Town Hall, killing 15 Arabs and injuring 80. During the night between 5 and 6 January, the Haganah bombed the Semiramis Hotel in Jerusalem that had been reported to hide Arab militiamen, killing 24 people. The next day, Irgun members in a stolen police van rolled a barrel bomb into a large group of civilians who were waiting for a bus by the Jaffa Gate, killing around 16. Another Irgun bomb went off in the Ramla market on February 18, killing 7 residents and injuring 45. On 28 February, the Palmah organised a bombing attack against a garage at Haifa, killing 30 people.\n\nIrgun was described as a terrorist organization by the United Nations, British, and United States governments, and in media such as \"The New York Times\" newspaper, and by the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. In 1946, The World Zionist Congress strongly condemned terrorist activities in Palestine and \"the shedding of innocent blood as a means of political warfare\". Irgun was specifically condemned.\n\nMenachem Begin was called a terrorist and a fascist by Albert Einstein and 27 other prominent Jewish intellectuals in a letter to the New York Times which was published on December 4, 1948. Specifically condemned was the participation of the Irgun in the Deir Yassin massacre:\n\n\nThe letter warns American Jews against supporting Begin's request for funding of his political party Herut, and ends with the warning:\n\nLehi was described as a terrorist organization by the British authorities and United Nations mediator Ralph Bunche.\n\nDuring the conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine before the war, the criterion of \"Purity of arms\" was used to distinguish between the respective attitudes of the Irgun and Haganah towards Arabs, with the latter priding itself on its adherence to principle. The Jewish society in the British Mandate Palestine generally disapproved and denounced violent attacks both on grounds moral rejection and political disagreement, stressing that terrorism is counter-productive in the Zionist quest for Jewish self-determination. Generally speaking, this precept requires that \"weapons remain pure [and that] they are employed only in self-defence and [never] against innocent civilians and defenceless people\". But if it \"remained a central value in education\" it was \"rather vague and intentionally blurred\" at the practical level.\n\nIn 1946, at a meeting held between the heads of the Haganah, David Ben-Gurion predicted a confrontation between the Arabs of Palestine and the Arab states. Concerning the \"principle of purity of arms\", he stressed that: \"The end does not justify all means. Our war is based on moral grounds\" and during the 1948 War, the Mapam, the political party affiliated to Palmach, asked \"a strict observance of the Jewish Purity of arms to secure the moral character of [the] war\". When he was later criticized by Mapam members for his attitude concerning the Arab refugee problem, Ben-Gurion reminded them of the Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle and the fact Palmah officers had been responsible for the \"outrage that had encouraged the Arabs' flight made the party uncomfortable.\"\n\nAccording to Avi Shlaim, this condemnation of the use of violence is one of the key features of 'the conventional Zionist account or old history' whose 'popular-heroic-moralistic version' is 'taught in Israeli schools and used extensively in the quest for legitimacy abroad'. Benny Morris adds that '[t]he Israelis' collective memory of fighters characterized by \"purity of arms\" is also undermined by the evidence of [the dozen case] of rapes committed in conquered towns and villages.' According to him, 'after the 1948 war, the Israelis tended to hail the \"purity of arms\" of its militiamen and soldiers to contrast this with Arab barbarism, which on occasion expressed itself in the mutilation of captured Jewish corpses.' According to him, 'this reinforced the Israelis' positive self-image and helped them \"sell\" the new state abroad and (...) demonized the enemy'.\n\nSome Israelis justify acts of political violence. Sixty years after participating in the assassination of Count Bernadotte, Geula Cohen had no regrets. As a broadcaster on Lehi's radio, she recalled the threats against Bernadotte in advance of the assassination. \"I told him if you are not going to leave Jerusalem and go to your Stockholm, you won't be any more.\" Asked if it was right to assassinate Bernadotte, she replied, \"There is no question about it. We would not have Jerusalem any more.\" In July 2006, the Menachem Begin Heritage Center organized a conference to mark the 60th anniversary of the King David Hotel bombing. The conference was attended by past and future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former members of Irgun. The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested that a plaque commemorating the bombing stated \"For reasons known only to the British, the hotel was not evacuated.\" Netanyahu, then chairman of Likud and Leader of the Opposition in the Knesset, opined that the bombing was a legitimate act with a military target, distinguishing it from an act of terror intended to harm civilians, since Irgun sent warnings to evacuate the building. He said \"Imagine that Hamas or Hizbullah would call the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and say, 'We have placed a bomb and we are asking you to evacuate the area.' They don't do that. That is the difference.\" The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested, saying \"We do not think that it is right for an act of terrorism, which led to the loss of many lives, to be commemorated\", and wrote to the Mayor of Jerusalem that such an \"act of terror\" could not be honored. The British government also demanded the removal of the plaque, pointing out that the statement on it accusing the British of failing to evacuate the hotel was untrue and \"did not absolve those who planted the bomb.\" To prevent a diplomatic incident, changes were made in the plaque's text. The final English version says \"Warning phone calls have been made to the hotel, The Palestine Post and the French Consulate, urging the hotel's occupants to leave immediately. The hotel was not evacuated and after 25 minutes the bombs exploded. To the Irgun's regret, 92 persons were killed.\"\n\n\n\n"}
