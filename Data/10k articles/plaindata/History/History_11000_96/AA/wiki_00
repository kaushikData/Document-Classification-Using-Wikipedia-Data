{"id": "1517483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1517483", "title": "Ages in Chaos", "text": "Ages in Chaos\n\nAges in Chaos is a book by the controversial writer Immanuel Velikovsky, first published by Doubleday in 1952, which put forward a major revision of the history of the Ancient Near East, claiming that the histories of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Israel are five centuries out of step. He followed this with a number of other works where he attempted to complete his reconstruction of ancient history, collectively known as the \"Ages in Chaos\" series.\n\nVelikovsky's work has been harshly criticised, including even by some fellow chronological revisionists.\n\nVelikovsky had put forward his ideas briefly in \"Theses for the Reconstruction of Ancient History\" in 1945, where he claimed that the history of the ancient Near East down to the time of Alexander the Great is garbled, but \"Ages in Chaos\" was his first full-length work on the subject.\n\nHis starting point for the first volume of the series was that the Exodus took place not, as orthodoxy has it, at some point during the Egyptian New Kingdom, but at the fall of the Middle Kingdom. In this and later volumes, he made heavy use of the concept of \"ghost doubles\" or alter-egos: historical figures who were known by different names in two different sources (e.g. Egyptian and Greek) and were considered to be entirely different people living in different centuries, but who he proposed to be actually erroneously dated accounts of the same individuals and events.\n\nFirst he claimed that the Ipuwer Papyrus came from the beginning of Egypt's Second Intermediate Period, and that this was an Egyptian account of the Plagues of Egypt. He then identified Tutimaios as the Pharaoh of the Exodus (much earlier than any of the mainstream candidates), the Hyksos with the biblical Amalekites, the Egyptian Pharaoh Hatshepsut with the Biblical Queen of Sheba, the land of Punt with Solomon's kingdom, and Pharaoh Thutmose III with the Biblical King Shishak. He claimed that the Egyptian Amarna letters from the late 18th Dynasty describe events from the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, from roughly the time of King Ahab.\n\nA second volume was due for publication shortly after this but was postponed. Instead it was followed in 1960 by \"Oedipus and Akhnaton\", where he claimed that the story of the Pharaoh Akhenaten was the origin of the Greek legend of Oedipus, and that Amenophis III was Laius, and Tutankhamun was Eteocles.\n\nIn the last two years of his life Velikovsky published a further two volumes of the series. In \"Peoples of the Sea\" he dealt with the final period of his reconstruction, the Persian invasions of Egypt. Manetho's 20th dynasty here becomes identified with the dynasties which ruled a newly independent Egypt in the early 4th century BCE, and Nectanebo I is a ghost double of Rameses III. Rameses III fought invasions by the Sea Peoples, including the \"Peleset\", conventionally identified with the Philistines. According to Velikovsky, the \"Peleset\" are actually the Persians and the other Sea Peoples are their Greek mercenaries. The 21st dynasty then becomes a line of priest-kings who ruled in the oases simultaneously with the Persians.\nIn \"Ramses II and His Time\" Velikovsky identified each of the major 19th dynasty pharaohs with a corresponding pharaoh of the 26th dynasty. Thus, Ramses I was an alter-ego of Necho I, Seti I of Psamtik I, Ramses II of Necho II, and Merneptah of Apries. In order to make these identifications work, Velikovsky claimed that the Hittite Empire was an invention of modern historians, and the supposedly Hittite archaeological remains in modern Turkey were actually Chaldean, i.e. Neo-Babylonian. The Hittite kings are held to be ghost doubles of the Neo-Babylonian kings, and Rameses II's battle with the Hittites at Kadesh is identical to Necho's fight against Nebuchadrezzar II at Carchemish, Nabopolassar is Mursili II, Neriglissar is Muwatalli, Labashi-Marduk is Urhi-Teshup, and Nebuchadrezzar II is Hattusili III.\n\nAt the time of his death he considered that completing his reconstruction of ancient history would require a further two volumes: \"The Assyrian Conquest\" and \"The Dark Age of Greece\"; these were never published in print in English, but online versions are available at the Velikovsky archive. In the former work, Velikovsky separated the 18th and 19th dynasties, specifically arguing that over a century separated Ay and Horemheb, conventionally regarded as his successor. Instead, he had the 22nd through 25th dynasties follow upon the earlier part of the 18th, leading down to the Assyrian invasions of the early 7th century BCE. The \"great king\" who crowned Horemheb was the Assyrian king.\n\nThe books have remained popular. The British publisher Sidgwick & Jackson reprinted \"Ages in Chaos\" ten times between 1953 and 1977, and Paradigma reprinted it as recently as 2009.\n\nThe revised chronology proposed by \"Ages in Chaos\" has been rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and Egyptologists. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky's usage of material for proof is often very selective. In 1965 the leading cuneiformist Abraham Sachs, in a forum at Brown University, discredited Velikovsky's use of Mesopotamian cuneiform sources. Velikovsky was never able to refute Sachs' attack.\n\nIn 1984 fringe science expert Henry H. Bauer wrote \"Beyond Velikovsky: The History of a Public Controversy\", which \"Time\" described as \"the definitive treatise debunking Immanuel Velikovsky\". Bauer accused Velikovsky of dogmatically asserting his own point of view to be correct, where at best this is only one possible interpretation of the historical material in question, and gives several examples from \"Ages in Chaos\".\n\nIn 1984 Egyptologist David Lorton produced a detailed critique of chapter 3 of \"Ages in Chaos\", which identifies Hatshepsut with the Queen of Sheba, e.g. accusing Velikovsky of mistakes which he would have avoided if he had a basic knowledge of the languages of the ancient near east.\n\nIn 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's \"Ages in Chaos\" series, the United Kingdom-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised a conference in Glasgow specifically to debate the revised chronology. The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including Peter James, John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and David Rohl, was that this particular revision of chronology was untenable, although they considered that the work had highlighted problems with the orthodox chronology.\n\nDavid Rohl, one of those involved in the 1978 Glasgow conference, has developed his own revised chronology. While he agrees that the Exodus should be dated to the collapse of the Middle Kingdom, and that Tutimaios is the Pharaoh of the Exodus, there are few points of contact between the Velikovsky and Rohl chronologies, largely because of the different methodologies used to resolve the later periods.\n\nJames, another Glasgow delegate who went on to publish a work challenging the concept of a widespread dark age at the end of the Bronze Age, credited Velikovsky with \"point[ing] the way to a solution by challenging Egyptian chronology\", but criticised Velikovsky's chronology as \"disastrously extreme\", producing \"a rash of new problems far more severe than those it hoped to solve\" and noted that \"Velikovsky understood little of archaeology and nothing of stratigraphy\".\n\nOne important disagreement is that Rohl and James consider that the chronology of the ancient Near East becomes fixed by the conquests of the Assyrians in the 7th century BCE. Velikovsky carried his revisionism into the Late Period of ancient Egypt, and considered that chronology only becomes fixed by the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE. They have also rejected some of Velikovsky's more extreme claims e.g. non-existence of Hittite Empire, changing the order of some Egyptian dynasties. Rohl and James's views remain controversial and are not accepted by most historians.\n\nIn spite of the unrelenting hostility of mainstream historians, Velikovsky's revisionism continues to attract adherents. Following his death in 1979 Velikovsky's theories were championed by Lynn E. Rose, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Buffalo. After Rose's death in 2013 the torch passed to a small group of disciples, among whom the most vocal and active are Charles Ginenthal and Emmet Sweeney. Ginenthal is the founder and principal contributor to an online journal \"The Velikovskian\". He has also authored a series of revisionist works under the title \"Pillars of the Past\". Emmet Sweeney has published his chronological revisions in a series of works entitled \"Ages in Alignment\".\n\nFar from slavishly championing Velikovsky's chronology, these scholars believe that Velikovsky did not go far enough. Under the influence of Gunnar Heinsohn they have shortened Velikovsky's timeline of ancient history even more. The 12th Dynasty of ancient Egypt has been moved almost 1500 years closer to the present, ending with Alexander the Great's invasion in -331. The Exodus has been redated to the 8th century, and the 18th Dynasty has been moved to the 8th-7th centuries. 274 years have been removed from the history of the Israelites. The Hittite Empire, which Velikovsky identified with the Neo-Babylonian Empire, has been identified with the Lydian Kingdom, while the Neo-Babylonians are now regarded as vassal kings of Babylon under the Macedonian Seleucids. The Neo-Assyrian Empire is now equated with the Persian Empire in northern Assyria and has been redated accordingly. In truth, very little of Velikovsky's chronology has been left untouched.\n\nLittle if any of this has been endorsed by the mainstream historians.\n\n"}

His works show a remarkable accuracy, especially the Treaty of Discovery published in Lisbon in 1563 and in English by Richard Hakluyt in 1601.\n\nAntónio Galvão was the son of Duarte Galvão, chief diplomat and chronicler to king Afonso V of Portugal. In 1527 he sailed for Portuguese India where he became captain of the Maluku and governor of the fort of Ternate from 1536 to 1540. He is described in Chapter II of the Fifth Decade of Asia\" as a respected governor, having sent a mission to Papua and receiving local embassies. He funded a seminar in Ternate, where he spent twelve thousand \"cruzados\" from the inheritance he had received from his father, and was known especially for his integrity. In 1540 he handed the government of the fortress to D. Jorge de Castro and returned to Portugal, where he discovered to have fallen into disgrace. He lived the last years in anonymity and poverty, in the Royal Hospital, awaiting a pension. There he died and was buried in 1557.\n\nAntónio Galvão left two manuscripts. One was the treaty of the discoveries printed after his death, in 1563, in Lisbon by his friend Francisco de Sousa Tavares. Based on numerous written sources and documents, the work presented for the first time a synthesis of all the discoveries made by Portuguese and Spanish until 1550. Richard Hakluyt had it translated and published in English in 1601 as \"The discoveries of the world - by Antonio Galvano\".\n\nThe second manuscript was a history of the Moluccas (Maluku) with the title:\n\n\nThis remained unpublished, the manuscript was passed by Francisco de Sousa Tavares to the crown. It is referred to by 16th-century chroniclers João de Barros and João Baptista Lavanha. It is alleged that a good part of it was reproduced verbatim within Damião de Góis's 1566-67 \"Chronica del rey D. Manuel\", but all trace of the original Galvão manuscript disappeared after Góis's death. In 1928, a document was found in the Archivo General de Indias in Seville with a history of the Maluku which was identified as being part (perhaps an early draft) of António Galvão's lost document. It was published in a bilingual (Portuguese-English) edition in 1971, arranged by Hubert Jacobs, under the title \"A Treatise on the Moluccas (c. 1544), probably the preliminary version of António Galvão's lost Historia das Moluccas\" (Rome: Jesuit Historical Society).\n\n"}

{"id": "31765330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31765330", "title": "Art Historical Photo Archives", "text": "Art Historical Photo Archives\n\nArt historical photo archives (or photoarchives) are collections of reproductions of works of art that document paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, architecture and sometimes installation photos. They are essential resource tools for the study of art history. Image collections deepen understanding of specific objects of art and the careers of individual artists as they also provide the means for a comparative approach to the study of artists’ works, national schools and period styles. The documentation that accompanies the images can also reveal patterns of art collecting, art market fluctuations and the changeable nature of public opinion. Photo archives build their collections and gather documentation for the works of art they record through purchases, gifts and photography campaigns. Information about ownership, condition, attribution, and subject identification is recorded at the time of acquisition and is frequently updated.\n\nThe founders of important art historical photo archives believed that a deep and broad visual knowledge was necessary for the study of art history. These pioneers, including Richard Hamann, Aby Warburg, Sir Robert Witt, William Martin Conway, Bernard Berenson, Cornelis Hofstede de Groot and Helen Clay Frick, were the first to realize the potential of photography as a means to provide researchers with materials that strengthen the documentation and interpretation of works of art. The photo archives they founded in the first half of the 20th century, now part of FotoMarburg, the Warburg Institute, the Witt Library, Villa I Tatti, the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie, and the Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive, are still used by countless researchers in the first half of the 21st century.\n\n\nIn 2009 the Courtauld Institute in collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz organized a series of conferences that were held in London, Florence and New York to discuss the future of photo archives. They felt that an examination of the origins of photo archives can help guide and shape their future and, at the same time, convey to the uninitiated how image resources continue to be used as essential elements for art historical research. Few doubt that if Helen Frick, Robert Witt, or W.M. Conway had lived to see the potential of digitizing the photo archives they established in the 1920s, they would have dedicated enormous resources and careful thought to realizing the digital future. However, there is a problem for photo archives in that currently they have no copyright claim to the majority of the images in their collection and thus they are unable to display them on the web. It is therefore now their task to develop and promote a new model for access and use of these extraordinary resources that will maximize the opportunities of current and future technical advances in a way that suits the demands of today’s scholars. This selection process, which is implicit in digitization projects and will inevitably exclude some images, renders the analog archive as indispensable as ever in the digital era. Whatever the method of delivery, whether the photograph itself or its digital surrogate, photo archives remain essential to the study of art history. The conferences produced the Florence Declaration, which made several recommendations for the preservation of analogue photo archives. As of May 2011, nearly 500 scholars had signed the Declaration.\n\n\n"}

The revolt targeted the settlement of the Amhara people and feudalistic system in place in the Ethiopian Empire.\n\nOn 13 December 1960, an attempt was made to overthrow Emperor Haile Selassie. The coup took place after the emperor left Ethiopia on a trip to Brazil. In the beginning of the revolt, rebels captured the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa and kidnapped the Ethiopian prince, 20 cabinet members, and many predominant politicians. In early stages, the coup was supported by the Imperial Guard. The Imperial Guard soon turned on the coup after the return of Emperor Haile on 17 December 1960. The forces of the Imperial Guard soon recaptured the city of Addis Ababa and freed government captives. The coup from that point on was considered a failure.\n\nToday, some sources argue the 1960 Ethiopian coup was the first major questioning of the Ethiopian government.\n\nThe movement began in the early 1960s. University students in Ethiopia questioned the government and monarchical rule. The small rebellion turned into a full-fledged student movement by 1967. Protesters were often determined to destroy and dismantle the entrenched feudal order to significantly improve the political and economic modernization of Ethiopia. Many protesters partook in frequent and violence-oriented\nverbal attacks on African governments for their corruption and abuse\nof power. The movement ended in 1974 and the Ethiopian Civil War began soon after.\n\nThe revolt is believed to have started as a result of many peasants in the southeastern region of Ethiopia, primarily composed of the Oromo people and Somali tribesmen, refusing to pay taxes and allow access to land to the Ethiopian government. The peasants also had strong opposition of the settlement of the Amhara people in Bale.\n\nThe revolt was led by Oromo leader and rebel figure Waqo Gutu and supported by the Somali government. Waqo Gutu is believed to have started the rebellion when he received no government aid after a conflict over grazing rights. After receiving no aid, he went to Somalia to supply himself and other rebels with weapons.\n\nIn one of the landmark battles at Malka Anna near Ganale River in 1963, the Oromo combatants took down two military helicopters using a non-automatic rifle called Dhombir. Hence, the period from 1963 to 1970 is locally known as the Dhombir war after the gun used by the Oromo fighters. The battle of Dhombir at Malka Anna was critical in that the rebels were able to capture and take a lot of weapons from the enemy thereby boosting their defensive capabilities.\n\nIn 1969 Somalia withdrew support for the rebellion after changing government.Soon after, an agreement was reached with the Ethiopian government and many predominant Oromo leaders were pardoned marking the end of the conflict.\n"}

The film was released in the United States on February 8, 2002.\n\nThe film tells the story of Los Angeles firefighter, Gordon Brewer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who seeks to avenge his son and wife's death at the hands of a guerrilla commando, by traveling to Colombia and facing his family's killers. The original script for the film had the same plotline but would have addressed American policy in the Middle East by taking place in Libya; director Davis and his screenwriters chose Colombia as the new location because it had not been used as extensively and touched on a current geopolitical conflict area. Noted anti-war activist Stan Goff was hired as a consultant but later described the film as horrible and stated that taking on the job was the worst mistake he had ever made.\n\nA bomb detonates in the plaza of the Colombian Consulate building in Los Angeles, killing nine people, including a caravan of Colombian officials and American intelligence agents. Among the civilians killed are the wife and son of LAFD firefighter, Captain Gordon \"Gordy\" Brewer, who was injured in the explosion. A tape is sent to the U.S. State Department, in which a masked man calling himself \"El Lobo\" (\"The Wolf\") claims responsibility, explaining it was in retaliation for the oppression of Colombia by the United States. The FBI believes \"El Lobo\" is a Colombian terrorist named Claudio Perrini. CIA Special Agent Peter Brandt, the Colombia Station Chief, is harshly reprimanded for the incident by a Senate Oversight Committee, which promptly terminates all CIA operations in Colombia. Brandt angrily returns to Mompós and meets with his paramilitary allies to plan a major offensive to take down Claudio.\n\nFrustrated at the political red tape regarding the investigation, Brewer travels to Mompós to personally hunt down Claudio but is quickly arrested for illegal entry. The guerrillas stage a prison break to free their comrades and abduct Brewer to demand a large ransom for him. Brandt's unit is alerted to Brewer's presence in Colombia but arrive too late. Brewer escapes the prison, avoids being captured, and secures a guerrilla zone pass from Canadian mechanic Sean Armstrong. Armstrong introduces him to drug runner Felix Ramirez, the manager of the cocaine distribution facility that finances the guerrillas. Pretending to be a mechanic, Brewer rigs several improvised explosives and destroys the facility. Felix is blamed for the destruction of the drug plant and is executed in front of a hiding Brewer's eyes. Brewer infiltrates Claudio's headquarters and plants a bomb to kill him, but he is captured when he tries to prevent a woman, Selena, from being caught in the blast radius along with her son, Mauro. At Claudio's home compound, Selena reveals she is Claudio's wife. She and Claudio once lost their own child during an American attack, which compelled Claudio to become a terrorist; Selena found and adopted Mauro, whose parents were killed in the attack. Nevertheless, Selena sympathizes with Brewer and admits that Claudio is planning another bombing in Washington, D.C..\n\nMeanwhile, Brandt's unit locates Claudio's compound and launches an attack. During the ensuing shootout, Selena helps free Brewer and, along with Brandt, travels back to the State Department in Washington, D.C. to help the search effort for Claudio. Selena identifies Union Station as the target, and the FBI investigates. On the pretense of using the lavatory, Selena excuses herself from the command room and becomes irritated when Mauro refuses to come with her. When Brewer sees Selena make the same gesture as the masked man who claimed to be El Lobo in the tape, he realizes that she was the Wolf all along, and Claudio serves as her figurehead, and that the entire motive behind their cause is personal revenge for the death of their daughter at the hands of the US. Furthermore, Brewer surmises the real target is the State Department, and that he was used to help Selena get past the building's security. Brewer quickly throws Mauro's toy dinosaur, which is carrying a bomb, out a window moments before it explodes. Brandt, realizing Brewer's suspicions, is shot and killed trying to stop Selena from fleeing the building.\n\nBrewer chases Selena to the basement of the building where she and Claudio ride off through the underground tunnels on a motorcycle. Brewer finds the tunnel control console and shuts the gates, preventing their escape. Brewer chops open some gas lines along the walls of the tunnel and, as they ride back, Selena shoots at Brewer, igniting the gas. Brewer jumps through a doorway just as the entire tunnel explodes. Selena and Claudio survive the blast, however, and attack him simultaneously. After a short, hand-to-hand fight, Selena is electrocuted by being tossed on the exposed circuitry of the control panel, and Claudio is finally killed when Brewer throws an axe into his chest. \n\nIn the aftermath, Brewer carries Mauro in his arms as they leave the State Department. A newscast voiceover explains that Brewer will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom for preventing one of the worst terrorist attacks in U.S. history from taking place.\n\n\nThe film was shot in Los Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C.. The scenes that represent Colombia were shot in the town of Coatepec in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Filming in Mexico lasted ten weeks. First were shot during first eight weeks and then returned to roll other two.\n\nThe September 11, 2001 attacks affected the release and editing of the final film. The original trailer was scrapped because it showed a major bomb attack in the United States. The film was originally scheduled to be released on October 5, 2001, but it was postponed due to its terrorism theme and eventually released on February 8, 2002. The premiere was held four days earlier. \"Collateral Damage\" was also supposed to include Colombian actress Sofía Vergara in the role of an airplane hijacker; however the scene where Vergara would hijack a plane was cut from the film. The film made $78 million worldwide against its $85 million budget. Warner Brothers released the DVD in the United States on July 30, 2002.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 19% of 142 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Despite its timely subject matter, \"Collateral Damage\" is an unexceptional and formulaic action thriller.\" Metacritic rated it 33/100 based on 34 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale. Desson Howe of the \"Washington Post\" called the film \"head-scratchingly ordinary\" and wrote, \"Even by the fast-and-loose standards of action filmmaking, \"Collateral Damage\" is a disappointment.\" Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" said, \"It's laughably unbelievable, yet it's hard to snicker at anything involving terrorists, even \"Collateral\"s obscure Colombian variety. What we get is simply another opportunity for Schwarzenegger — who seems to be in perpetual Terminator mode — to flex his muscles.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded the film three out of four stars and described it as \"a skillfully made example of your typical Schwarzenegger action film\".\n\n\n"}

After the meeting, Philip ordered the tree cut down and hacked to pieces, sending the message that he would offer no quarter to the English.\n\nA quite different account is given by the Minstrel of Rheims (c. 1260), a thirteenth-century historical fiction:\nKing Richard sent a message to the counts of Sancerre and of Barre, telling them that they took the king's bread and gave him nothing in return but if they were brave enough to come to the elm tree at Gisors, he would consider them truly courageous. The French nobles sent the message back that they would come the next day, at the third hour, to cut the tree down, in spite of him. When the English king heard that they were coming to cut down the tree, he had the trunk reinforced with bands of iron, that were wrapped five times around it. The next morning the French nobles armed themselves, and assembled five squadrons of their men, one of which was led by the count of Sancerre, another by the count of Chartres, the third by the count of Vendôme, the fourth by the count of Nevers, and the fifth by Sir William of Barre and Sir Alain of Roucy. They rode up to the elm tree at Gisors, with the crossbowmen and carpenters out front, and they had in their hands sharp axes and good pointed hammers, with which to cut the bands that were fastened around the tree. They stopped at the elm tree, tore off the bands, and cut it down, in spite of all resistance.\n\nThe event has been used in the history proposed by Pierre Plantard and other pseudo-historical theories. In this context, the \"Cutting of the elm\" was portrayed as marking the split between the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion.\n\n"}

She read for a DPhil at Somerville College of the University of Oxford with a Marshall Scholarship, which she received in 1968 with her thesis \"The iconography of the Athenian white-ground lekythos\" under the supervision of Martin Robertson. This formed the partial basis for her first individual monograph, \"Athenian white lekythoi: patterns and painters\", a standard reference work for the white-ground lekythos.\n\nAfter the death of Sir John Beazley in 1970, Kurtz organised his books, papers, notebooks, drawings and photographs to form the Beazley Archive, initially kept at the Ashmolean Museum, and was named Beazley Archivist, a chair created for her. The post is connected to Wolfson College, where she remains a fellow. As Professor of Classical Art at the University, she lectured and tutored until her retirement in 2011.\n\nHer scholarly output, especially in the first decades of her career, focussed on Greek pottery. Collaborations with John Boardman (art historian) on \"Greek Burial Customs\" and Brian Sparkes (edd.) on \"The Eye of Greece: studies in the art of Athens\" expanded the topics on which she wrote. Her interest in the work of Beazley produced several articles and a posthumous collaboration in \"The Berlin Painter\", which uses Beazley's drawings as the basis of study of anatomy and connoisseurship. From 2000, with the publication of \"The reception of classical art in Britain: an Oxford story of plaster casts from the antique\" and the \"Reception of classical art: an introduction\", she has moved into the history of collections more fully.\n\nFrom 1979, the Beazley Archive was digitized, in collaboration with IBM and others. Put on-line in 1998, it was one of the earliest large data-sets available; as the Classical Art Research Centre (CARC) it now contains over 100,000 records.\n\nIn 2000, Kurtz launched CLAROS, the Classical Art Research Online Services, an umbrella that included the Beazley archive as well as similar archives and research centres across Europe. In 2007, she upgraded the database using semantic web technologies, in collaboration with the Oxford e-Research Centre (where she is now a senior researcher) and the Oxford Internet Institute (where she is now a research associate); the site went live in 2011.

{"id": "4536912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4536912", "title": "History of the Romani people", "text": "History of the Romani people\n\nThe Romani people, also referred to depending on the sub-group as Roma, Sinti or Sindhi, or Kale are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group, who live primarily in Europe. They originated in northwest regions of the Indian subcontinent and left sometime between the 6th and 11th century to work in Middle Eastern courts of their own volition, or as slaves. A small number of nomadic groups were cut off from their return to the subcontinent by conflicts and moved west, eventually settling in Europe, Turkey and North Africa via Iran.\n\nThe Romani have been described by Diana Muir Appelbaum as unique among peoples because they have never identified themselves with a territory; they have no tradition of an ancient and distant homeland from which their ancestors migrated, nor do they claim the right to national sovereignty in any of the lands where they reside. Rather, Romani identity is bound up with the ideal of freedom expressed, in part, in having no ties to a homeland. The absence of traditional origin stories and of a written history has meant that the origin and early history of the Romani people was long an enigma. Indian origin was suggested on linguistic grounds as early as the late 18th century.\n\nOne theory suggests that the name ultimately derives from a form \"ḍōmba-\" 'man of low caste living by singing and music', attested in Classical Sanskrit. An alternative view is that the ancestors of the Romani were part of the military in Northern India. When there were invasions by Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi and these soldiers were defeated, they were moved west with their families into the Byzantine Empire between AD 1000 and 1030.\n\nThe genetic evidence identified an Indian origin for Roma. Genetic evidence connects the Romani people to the descendants of groups which emigrated from South Asia towards Central Asia during the medieval period.\n\nUntil the mid-to-late 18th century, theories of the origin of the Romani were mostly speculative. In 1782, Johann Christian Christoph Rüdiger published his research that pointed out the relationship between the Romani language and Hindustani. Subsequent work supported the hypothesis that Romani shared a common origin with the Indo-Aryan languages of Northern India, with Romani grouping most closely with Sinhalese in a recent study.\n\nDomari was once thought to be the \"sister language\" of Romani, the two languages having split after the departure from the South Asia, but more recent research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate languages within the Central zone (Hindustani) Saraiki language group of languages. The Dom and the Rom are therefore likely to be descendants of two different migration waves from the Indian subcontinent, separated by several centuries.\n\nFurther evidence for the South Asian origin of the Romanies came in the late 1990s. Researchers doing DNA analysis discovered that Romani populations carried large frequencies of particular Y chromosomes (inherited paternally) and mitochondrial DNA (inherited maternally) that otherwise exist only in populations from South Asia.\n\n47.3% of Romani men carry Y chromosomes of haplogroup H-M82 which is rare outside South Asia. Mitochondrial haplogroup M, most common in Indian subjects and rare outside Southern Asia, accounts for nearly 30% of Romani people. A more detailed study of Polish Roma shows this to be of the M5 lineage, which is specific to India. Moreover, a form of the inherited disorder congenital myasthenia is found in Romani subjects. This form of the disorder, caused by the 1267delG mutation, is otherwise known only in subjects of Indian ancestry. This is considered to be the best evidence of the Indian ancestry of the Romanis.\n\nThe Romanis have been described as \"a conglomerate of genetically isolated founder populations\". The number of common Mendelian disorders found among Romanis from all over Europe indicates \"a common origin and founder effect\". See also this table:\n\nA study from 2001 by Gresham et al. suggests \"a limited number of related founders, compatible with a small group of migrants splitting from a distinct caste or tribal group\". Also the study pointed out that \"genetic drift and different levels and sources of admixture, appear to have played a role in the subsequent differentiation of populations\". The same study found that \"a single lineage ... found across Romani populations, accounts for almost one-third of Romani males.\n\nA 2004 study by Morar et al. concluded that the Romanies are \"a founder population of common origins that has subsequently split into multiple socially divergent and geographically dispersed Gypsy groups\". The same study revealed that this population \"was founded approximately 32–40 generations ago, with secondary and tertiary founder events occurring approximately 16–25 generations ago\".\n\nThe Burushos of Hunza have a paternal lineage genetic marker that is grouped with Pamiri speakers from Afghanistan and Tajikistan, and the Sinti or Sindhi Romani ethnic group. This find of shared genetic haplogroups may indicate an origin of the Romani people in or around these regions.\n\nAccording to a genetic study on The Phylogeography of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup H1a1a-M82 in 2012, the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of northern India, traditionally referred to collectively as the Ḍoma, are the likely ancestral populations of modern European Roma.\n\nA mtdna or ydna study provides valuable information but a limitation of these studies is that they represent only one instantiation of the genealogical process. Autosomal data permits simultaneous analysis of multiple lineages, which can provide novel information about population history. According to a genetic study on autosomal data on Roma the source of Southasian Ancestry in Roma is North-West India. The two populations showing closest relatedness to Roma were Gujaratis. The classical and mtDNA genetic markers suggested the closest affinity of the Roma with Rajput and Sindhi populations from Rajasthan and the Punjab respectively.\n\nMany ancient historians mention a tribe by the name of Sigynnae (Tsigani) on various locations in Europe. Early records of itinerant populations from India begin as early as the Sassanid period. Donald Kenrick notes the first recorded presence of \"Zott\" in Baghdad in AD 420, Khaneikin in AD 834.\n\nContemporary scholars have suggested one of the first written references to the Romanies, under the term \"Atsingani\", (derived from the Greek \"ἀτσίγγανοι - atsinganoi\"), dates from the Byzantine era during a time of famine in the 9th century. In the year AD 800, Saint Athanasia gave food to \"foreigners called the Atsingani\" near Thrace. Later, in AD 803, Theophanes the Confessor wrote that Emperor Nikephoros I had the help of the \"Atsingani\" to put down a riot with their \"knowledge of magic\". However, the Atsingani were a Manichean sect that disappeared from chronicles in the 11th century. \"Atsinganoi\" was used to refer to itinerant fortune tellers, ventriloquists and wizards who visited the Emperor Constantine IX in the year 1054.\n\nThe hagiographical text, \"The Life of St. George the Anchorite,\" mentions that the \"Atsingani\" were called on by Constantine to help rid his forests of the wild animals which were killing off his livestock.\n\nIn 1323 Simon Simeonis, an Irish Franciscan monk, described people in likeness to the \"atsingani\" living in Crete: \"We also saw outside this city <nowiki>[</nowiki>Candia<nowiki>]</nowiki> a tribe of people, who worship according to the Greek rite, and assert themselves to be of the race of Cain. These people rarely or never stop in one place for more than thirty days, but always, as if cursed by God, are nomad and outcast. After the thirtieth day they wander from field to field with small, oblong, black, and low tents, like those of the Arabs, and from cave to cave, because the place inhabited by them becomes after the term of thirty days so full of vermin and other filth that it is impossible to live in their neighbourhood.\"\n\n1350 Ludolf von Sudheim mentioned a similar people with a unique language whom he called \"Mandapolos\", a word which some theorize was possibly derived from the Greek word \"Mantipolos - Μαντιπόλος\" \"frenzied\" from \"mantis - μάντις\" (meaning \"prophet, fortune teller\") and \"poleo - πολέω\".\n\nAround 1360, a fiefdom (called the \"Feudum Acinganorum\") was established in Corfu. It mainly used Romani serfs and the Romanies on the island were subservient.\n\nBy the 14th century, the Romanies had reached the Balkans and Bohemia; by the 15th century, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal; and by the 16th century, Russia, Denmark, Scotland and Sweden. (although DNA evidence from mid-11th century skeletons in Norwich suggest that at least a few individuals may have arrived earlier, perhaps due to Viking enslavement of Romani from the eastern Mediterranean or liaisons with the Varangians).\n\nSome Romanies migrated from Persia through North Africa, reaching Europe via Spain in the 15th century. The two currents met in France. Romanies began immigrating to the United States in colonial times, with small groups in Virginia and French Louisiana. Larger-scale immigration began in the 1860s, with groups of Romnichal from Britain. The largest number immigrated in the early 20th century, mainly from the Vlax group of Kalderash. Many Romanies also settled in Latin America.\n\nAccording to historian Norman Davies, a 1378 law passed by the governor of Nauplion in the Greek Peloponnese confirming privileges for the \"atsingani\" is \"the first documented record of Romany Gypsies in Europe\". Similar documents, again representing the Romanies as a group that had been exiled from Egypt, record them reaching Braşov, Transylvania in 1416; Hamburg, Holy Roman Empire in 1418; and Paris in 1427. A chronicler for a Parisian journal described them as dressed in a manner that the Parisians considered shabby, and reports that the Church had them leave town because they practiced palm-reading and fortune-telling.\n\nTheir early history shows a mixed reception. Although 1385 marks the first recorded transaction for a Romani slave in Wallachia, they were issued safe conduct by Sigismund of the Holy Roman Empire in 1417. Romanies were ordered expelled from the Meissen region of Germany in 1416, Lucerne in 1471, Milan in 1493, France in 1504, Aragon in 1512, Sweden in 1525, England in 1530 (see Egyptians Act 1530), and Denmark in 1536. In 1510, any Romani found in Switzerland were ordered to be put to death, with similar rules established in England in 1554, Denmark in 1589, and Sweden in 1637, whereas Portugal began deportations of Romanies to its colonies in 1538.\n\nLater, a 1596 English statute, however, gave Romanies special privileges that other wanderers lacked; France passed a similar law in 1683. Catherine the Great of Russia declared the Romanies \"crown slaves\" (a status superior to serfs), but also kept them out of certain parts of the capital. In 1595, Ştefan Răzvan overcame his birth into slavery, and became the Voivode (Prince) of Moldavia.\n\nIn Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia, Romanies were enslaved for five centuries, until abolition in the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Romani culture inspired in their neighbors a wealth of artistic works. Among the most notable works are \"Carmen\" and \"La Vie de Bohème\".\n\nIn 1758, Maria Theresa of Austria began a program of assimilation to turn Romanies into \"ujmagyar\" (new Hungarians). The government built permanent huts to replace mobile tents, forbade travel, and forcefully removed children from their parents to be fostered by non-Romani. By 1894, the majority of Romanies counted in a Hungarian national census were sedentary. In 1830, Romani children in Nordhausen were taken from their families to be fostered by Germans.\n\nRussia also encouraged settlement of all nomads in 1783, and the Polish introduced a settlement law in 1791. Bulgaria and Serbia banned nomadism in the 1880s.\n\nIn 1783, racial legislation against Romanies was repealed in the United Kingdom, and a specific \"Turnpike Act\" was established in 1822 to prevent nomads from camping on the roadside, strengthened in the Highways Act of 1835.\n\nIn 1538, the first anti-ziganist (anti-Romani) legislation was issued in Moravia and Bohemia, which were under Habsburg rule. Three years later, after a series of fires in Prague which were blamed on the Romani, Ferdinand I ordered them to be expelled. In 1545, the Diet of Augsburg declared that \"whoever kills a Gypsy, will be guilty of no murder\". The massive killing spree that resulted prompted the government to eventually step in and \"forbid the drowning of Romani women and children\".\nIn 1710, Joseph I ordered that \"all adult males were to be hanged without trial, whereas women and young males were to be flogged and banished forever.\" In addition, they were to have their right ears cut off in the kingdom of Bohemia and their left ear in Moravia.\n\nIn 1530, England issued the Egyptians Act which banned Romani from entering the country and required those living in the country to leave within 16 days. Failure to do so could result in confiscation of property, imprisonment and deportation. The act was amended with the Egyptians Act 1554, which ordered the Romani to leave the country within a month. Non-complying Romanies were executed.\n\nIn 1660, Romanies were prohibited from residence in France by Louis XIV.\n\nIn 1685, Portugal deported Romani to Brasil.\n\nIn 1879, a national meeting of Romanies was held in the Hungarian town of Kisfalu (now Pordašinci, Slovenia). Romanies in Bulgaria set up a conference in 1919 to protest for their right to vote, and a Romani journal, \"Istiqbal\" (Future) was founded in 1923.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the All-Russian Union of Gypsies was organized in 1925 with a journal, \"Romani Zorya\" (Romani Dawn) beginning two years later. The \"Romengiro Lav\" (Romani Word) writer's circle encouraged works by authors like Nikolay Aleksandrovich Pankov and Nina Dudarova.\n\nA General Association of the Gypsies of Romania was established in 1933 with a national conference, and two journals, \"Neamul Țiganesc\" (Gypsy Nation) and \"Timpul\" (Time). An \"international\" conference was organized in Bucharest the following year.\n\nIn Yugoslavia, Romani journal \"Romano Lil\" started publication in 1935.\n\nDuring World War II, the Nazis murdered 220,000 to 500,000 Romanies in a genocide referred to as the \"Porajmos\". Like the Jews, they were segregated into ghettoes before being sent to concentration camps or extermination camps. They were often killed on sight, especially by the Einsatzgruppen on the Eastern Front. 25% of European Roma perished in the genocide.\n\nIn Communist central and eastern Europe, Romanies experienced assimilation schemes and restrictions of cultural freedom. The Romani language and Romani music were banned from public performance in Bulgaria. In Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of Romanies from Slovakia, Hungary and Romania were re-settled in border areas of Czech lands and their nomadic lifestyle was forbidden. In Czechoslovakia, where they were labeled as a “socially degraded stratum,” Romani women were sterilized as part of a state policy to reduce their population. This policy was implemented with large financial incentives, threats of denying future social welfare payments, misinformation and involuntary sterilization.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Germany deported tens of thousands of migrants to central and eastern Europe. Sixty percent of some 100,000 Romanian nationals deported under a 1992 treaty were Romani.\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 21st century many Romanies from central and eastern Europe attempted to migrate to western Europe or Canada. The majority of them were turned back. Several of these countries established strict visa requirements to prevent further migration.\n\nIn 2005, the Decade of Roma Inclusion was launched in nine Central and Southeastern European countries to improve the socio-economic status and social inclusion of the Romani minority across the region.\n\nDecade of Roma Inclusion 2005 - 2015 has not been successful at all. The Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-2015 is coming to the end of its originally defined term. It initiated crucially important processes for Roma inclusion in Europe, and provided the impetus for an EU-led effort covering similar subject matter, the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies up to 2020 (EU Framework).\n\nRomanies began immigrating to the United States in colonial times, with small groups in Virginia and French Louisiana. Larger-scale immigration began in the 1860s, with groups of Romnichal from Britain. The largest number immigrated in the early 20th century, mainly from the Vlax group of Kalderash. Many Romanies also settled in other countries of the Americas.\n\nIn August 1997, TV Nova, a popular television station in the Czech Republic, broadcast a documentary on the situation of Romanies who had emigrated to Canada. The short report portrayed Romanies in Canada living comfortably with support from the state, and sheltered from racial discrimination and violence. At the time, life was particularly difficult for many Romanies living in the Czech Republic. As a result of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, many Romanies were left without citizenship in either the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Following the large flood in Moravia in July, many Romanies were left homeless yet unwelcome in other parts of the country.\n\nAlmost overnight, there were reports of Romanies preparing to emigrate to Canada. According to one report, 5,000 Romani from the city of Ostrava intended to move. Mayors in some Czech towns encouraged the exodus, offering to help pay for flights so that Romanies could leave. The following week, the Canadian Embassy in Prague was receiving hundreds of calls a day from Romanies and flights between the Czech Republic and Canada were sold out until October. In 1997, 1,285 people from the Czech Republic arrived in Canada and claimed refugee status, a rather significant jump from the 189 Czechs who did so the previous year.\n\nLucie Cermakova, a spokesperson at the Canadian Embassy in Prague, criticized the program, claiming it \"presented only one side of the matter and picked out only nonsensical ideas.\" Marie Jurkovicova, a spokesperson for the Czech Embassy in Ottawa suggested that \"the program was full of half-truths, which strongly distorted reality and practically invited the exodus of large groups of Czech Romanies. It concealed a number of facts.\"\n\nPresident Václav Havel and (after some hesitation) Prime Minister Václav Klaus attempted to convince the Romanies not to leave. With the help of Romani leaders like Emil Scuka, Chairman of the Roma Civic Initiative, they urged Romanies to remain in country and work to solve their problems with the larger Czech population.\n\nThe movement of Romanies to Canada had been fairly easy because visa requirements for Czech citizens had been lifted by the Canadian government in April 1996.

{"id": "21414057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21414057", "title": "Inverted totalitarianism", "text": "Inverted totalitarianism\n\nThe political philosopher Sheldon Wolin coined the term inverted totalitarianism in 2003 to describe what he saw as the emerging form of government of the United States. Wolin analysed the United States as increasingly turning into a managed democracy (similar to an illiberal democracy). He uses the term \"inverted totalitarianism\" to draw attention to the totalitarian aspects of the American political system while emphasizing its differences from proper totalitarianism, such as Nazi and Stalinist regimes. \n\nThe book \"Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt\" (2012) by Chris Hedges and Joe Sacco portrays inverted totalitarianism as a system where corporations have corrupted and subverted democracy and where economics trumps politics.\nEvery natural resource and living being is commodified and exploited by large corporations to the point of collapse as excess consumerism and sensationalism lull and manipulate the citizenry into surrendering their liberties and their participation in government.\n\nWolin argues that the United States is increasingly totalitarian as a result of repeated military mobilizations: to fight the Axis powers in the 1940s, to contain the Soviet Union during the Cold War and to fight the War on Terror after the September 11 attacks.\n\nWolin describes this development toward inverted totalitarianism in terms of two conflicting political power centers, namely the constitutional imaginary and the power imaginary. Wolin speaks of imaginaries to include political tendencies as well as existing political conditions. He explains: \n\nWolin explains that the constitutional imaginary \"prescribes the means by which power is legitimated, accountable and constrained\". Referring to Thomas Hobbes, Wolin understands the power imaginary as a quest for power that is rationalized by a fear of collective mortality. The power imaginary may \"undermine or override the boundaries mandated in the constitutional imaginary\" through fears of a dangerous enemy: \n\nThe power imaginary does not only reduce democracy within the United States, it also promotes the United States as \"Superpower\" that develops and expands its current position as the only global superpower: \n\nInverted totalitarianism shares similarities with the classical totalitarianism, like Nazi Germany. First of all, both regimes are totalitarian because they tend to dominate as much as possible. Both regimes use fear, preemptive wars and elite domination, but inverted and classical totalitarianism deviate in several important ways:\nWolin writes: \n\nThe superpower claims both democracy and global hegemony. Democracy and hegemony is coupled by means of managed democracy, where the elections are free and fair but the people lack the actual ability to change the policies, motives and goals of the state. \n\nManagerial methods are applied to elections: \n\nBy using managerial methods and developing management of elections, the democracy of the United States has become sanitized of political participation, therefore managed democracy is \"a political form in which governments are legitimated by elections that they have learned to control\". Under managed democracy, the electorate is prevented from having a significant impact on policies adopted by the state because of the opinion construction and manipulation carried out by means of technology, social science, contracts and corporate subsidies.\n\nManagerial methods are also the means by which state and global corporations unite so that corporations increasingly assume governmental functions and services and corporations become still more dependent on the state. A main object of managed democracy is privatization and the expansion of the private, together with reduction of governmental responsibility for the welfare of the citizens.\n\nAccording to Wolin, the United States has two main totalizing dynamics:\n\nSheldon Wolin's book \"Democracy Incorporated: Managed Democracy and the Specter of Inverted Totalitarianism\" received a Lannan Literary Award for an Especially Notable Book in 2008.\n\nIn a review of Wolin's \"Democracy Incorporated\" in \"Truthdig,\" political scientist and author Chalmers Johnson wrote that the book is a \"devastating critique\" of the contemporary government of the United States—including the way it has changed in recent years and the actions that \"must\" be undertaken \"if it is not to disappear into history along with its classic totalitarian predecessors: Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and Bolshevik Russia\". In Johnson's view, Wolin’s is one of the best analyses of why presidential elections are unlikely to be effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of inverted totalitarianism. Johnson writes that Wolin’s work is \"fully accessible\" and that understanding Wolin's argument \"does not depend on possessing any specialized knowledge\". Johnson believes Wolin's analysis is more of an explanation of the problems of the United States than a description of how to solve these problems, \"particularly since Wolin believes that the U.S. political system is corrupt\" and \"heavily influenced by financial contributions primarily from wealthy and corporate donors, but that nonetheless Wolin’s analysis is still one of the best discourses on where the U.S. went wrong\".\n\nKevin Zeese and Margaret Flowers expressed the following view: We are living in a time of Inverted Totalitarianism, in which the tools used to maintain the status quo are much more subtle and technologically advanced ... These include propaganda and major media outlets that hide the real news about conditions at home and our activities around the world behind distractions [...] Another tool is to create insecurity in the population so that people are unwilling to speak out and take risks for fear of losing their jobs [...] Changes in college education also silence dissent [...] Adjunct professors [...] are less willing to teach topics that are viewed as controversial. This, combined with massive student debt, are tools to silence the student population, once the center of transformative action.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a monk, apparently contemporary with Emperor Heraclius (610–41). Gelzer (\"Sextus Julius Africanus\", 41) identifies the author with the Monophysite Syrian Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch John of the Sedre, who ruled from 630 to 648.\n\nJohn of Antioch's chronicle, \"Historia chronike\", is a universal history stretching from Adam to the death of Phocas; it is one of the many adaptations and imitations of the better known chronicle of John Malalas. His sources include Sextus Julius Africanus, Eusebius, and Ammianus Marcellinus. Only fragments remain.\n\nThe fragments of the chronicle are contained in two collections, the Codex Parisinus 1763, which was published in an edition by Claudius Salmasius, and the encyclopedia of history made by order of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (912–59), in fifty-three chapters. Of the Constantinian collection only parts remain (Krumbacher, \"Byzantinische Litteraturgebchichte\", 258–60). Two titles: \"Of Virtue and Vice\" and \"Of Conspiracies against Emperors\" contain the literary remains of John of Antioch. A difficulty arises from the fact that a great part of the extracts (from the Roman Commonwealth of Justin I) differs considerably from the corresponding quotations in the Salmasian collection. The Constantinian passages are of the nature the old Hellenic writing of history, the Salmasian ones are rather Byzantine and Christian. The Salmasian compilation is older, and so appears to be the original text; the other is no doubt a re-arrangement made under the influence of the Hellenic Renaissance started by patriarch Photius. But some authorities see in them two different originals and speak of a \"Constantinian\" and a \"Salmasian\" John of Antioch.\n\nThe Salmasian excerpts are edited by Cramer, \"Anecdota Graecae cod. mss. regiae Parisiensis\", II, Oxford 1839, 383–401.

He is regarded as the first historian to attempt to discredit conventional historical beliefs about the 'Mfecane' - a period of wars during the 1820s and 1830s that resulted in the emergence of the Zulu Kingdom. In a paper published in the \"Journal of African History\" in 1988, Cobbing argued that the Mfecane had been the construct of Apartheid politicians and historians attempting to justify the longstanding oppression of black South Africans by the white minority. Instead of an internally induced process of black-on-black destruction, Cobbing argued that much of the violence had been brought about by European slave traders and settlers, who had contracted local tribal leaders to capture slaves for sale at Delagoa Bay (now Maputo). The rise of the Zulu state, under Cobbing's hypothesis, was thus more of a defensive reaction to the slave-trading activities of other tribes in the region, rather than a process of active internal aggression, as argued by some contemporary scholars.\n\nCobbing's hypothesis was highly controversial when first published. Several books and articles have been written focused on rebutting Cobbing's arguments – a prominent example being Roger B. Beck's \"Slavery in South Africa: Captive Labor on the Dutch Frontier\", which featured a collection of articles challenging Cobbing's contentions. Often now referred to as the \"Cobbing controversy\", historians are still very much divided on the issue of the emergence of the Zulu nation and the accuracy of conventional accounts of the Mfecane. Most agree however that Cobbing's analysis offered several key breakthroughs, and offered a robust alternative to accounts of the Mfecane that had been taught in school history curricula during Apartheid.\n\nCobbing spent two months as a visiting fellow at the University of Oxford in 2002. He currently lives in Grahamstown, South Africa, and recently retired from lecturing in history at Rhodes University, where his course \"The Origins of the Modern World Crisis\" was very popular.

The organization later was expanded to include concerns for additional areas in the arts and sciences. At the same time she founded the official web site of the sculptor Jim Gary. In 2001 it was moved to another web site she created that may feature other artists as well, \"Kafi Benz Productions\".\n\nBorn during 1941 in Chatham, New Jersey, her mother was a commercial artist, graphic designer, and illustrator and her father was a prominent physician and surgeon who was chief of staff at a hospital in Morristown.\n\nThe \"Jersey Jetport Site Association\" was a small, but effective conservation organization, circumventing the efforts of the Port Authority to replace Newark Airport with a much larger complex farther to the west. After infiltrating meetings of the powerful authority headed by Austin J. Tobin, that were held to marshal support among construction companies and unions, the members of the association distributed opposition literature and drew public attention to its efforts. Greater opposition arose among the residents of the massive area that would be affected once the issue was revealed by coverage of the expulsion of four of the \"JJSA\" members (Kafi Benz, Joan Kelly, Esty Weiss, and Betty White) from a meeting at a Newark hotel, the Essex House, in a local newspaper, the Newark Evening News, on Thursday, December 3, 1959. Coverage quickly included publications such as the New York Times.\nThe \"JJSA\" was closely followed by a sister organization, a new sub-committee founded in Washington, D.C. within the \"North American Wildlife Foundation\", and these combined efforts led quickly to the establishment of the park that would become the \"Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge\" by an act of Congress on Thursday, November 3, 1960. Residents such as Geraldine R. Dodge and Marcellus Hartley Dodge, Sr. contributed the funds necessary to purchase the core of the swamp as the legal opposition progressed into a victory for the preservationists that led to the perpetual protection of the important natural habitat. Along with providing the funds to seek other donors, the influence of such prominent residents opened doors to legislators. Marcellus Dodge also was instrumental in establishing dialogue with established conservation groups.\n\nThe initial donation of land to the federal government as a park was . The park now consists of or almost 12 square miles of varied habitats. It was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1966 and given wilderness status in 1968.\n\nDuring the final period of the founding of the park, Secretary of the Interior, Stewart Lee Udall, headed the federal department which was in charge of parks. He supported the efforts of these conservationists and commented that he believed they mounted the greatest effort ever made by residents in America to protect a natural habitat. Several national news magazines also noted the success the tiny organization achieved.\n\nIn the late 1960s Benz became a director of the \"Somerset Art Association\", then located in Bernardsville, New Jersey, exhibited fine art, and participated in the planning and administration of its annual competitive regional art show. The organization has been renamed as, \"The Center for Contemporary Art\" (CCA), is located in Bedminster, and is noted as a regional art center with a comprehensive studio art school, professional exhibition program, and a community outreach component. Her painting and sculpture works are held in private collections in several states. Occasionally sitting as a model for sculpture classes taught at the association by Berta Margoulies (a 1946 Guggenheim fellowship recipient), many sculptures of Benz have been exhibited by these students.\nAt that time a friendship with sculptor Jim Gary developed that would lead to her representing the sculptor at many times, eventually becoming his publicist, creating and maintaining the official web site for Gary and his work, and becoming the director of his studio, \"Jim Gary's Twentieth Century Dinosaurs\", marketing and placing his works and exhibition.\n\nWhen Gary died in January 2006, Benz established a memorial fund and led efforts to bring about the placement of sculptures from his traveling exhibition, as a single collection in a suitable museum or institution where the sculptures in the collection would remain open to the public. By 2009 negotiations with a site in Sarasota seemed assured and much publicity ensued, through 2010. That contract was not executed, however, and negotiations were redirected successfully to a museum in Tallahassee.\n\nIn August 2011 twenty-one Gary sculptures were packed into vans and moved from Colts Neck, New Jersey for a ten-year display at the Tallahassee Museum in Florida. When National Geographic Magazine was unable to meet the schedule, Benz invited three free-lance photographers to document the preparations and complex move with videos and still photographs.\n\nShe represented painter Lee W. Hughes also, principally while he was a transparent watercolor artist, with a studio and gallery in Mendham, New Jersey. She also represented his wife and her longtime friend, pencil medium artist Sue Hughes (née McQuillan), while she was working out of a studio in New Jersey and later, in California.\n\nA search committee headed by Virginia Laudano, of the \"Art Club of Sun City Center\", invited Kafi Benz to judge its thirty-sixth annual art show held during February 2003 jointly with the prominent Tampa Bay area multi-media artist, Gainor Roberts. Soon thereafter, Benz participated in a project with transparent watercolor artist, John Crawford, to publish his research of an early Renoir painting of Marie Le Coeur, that was among his art collection since its acquisition in Chicago during the 1930s. He is the namesake of the \"John Crawford Art Education Studio\" that was created after his death at SouthShore Regional Library of Hillsborough County, which now features many of his own paintings. The planned book was not published before his death.\n\nAmong several positions working with Denise Kowal, the founder of the Sarasota Chalk Festival, in 2012, Benz became the manager of its mural committee, ‘’Going Vertical’’, locating sites and co-ordinating the work of the international artists who performed their work as muralists on buildings in the region as part of the festival. During this time she developed a relationship with the French graffiti artist, MTO, that eventually, led to Benz being identified by him as the curator for several of the murals he later created independently. During the festival of 2012, he had become the subject of intense focus in the community because of curious interpretations of some of his murals that grew into a veritable polarized controversy, perpetuated by those projecting those unsupported interpretations. The controversy raged on for months and led to the destruction of the huge mural that provoked it. She also became the co-translator and narrator of a documentary film MTO created about his perspective of the saga and the murals he painted in response to various stages of it, as they unfolded. The film, \"FL: unpremeditated movie\", was released in March 2013.\n\nDuring the 1980s Benz became active in environmental and historic preservation in Sarasota, Florida. She joined the \"Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation, Inc.\" shortly after Veronica Morgan founded the organization in 1984, and has served in several positions among its officers as well as being a director of the organization over the years. Kafi Benz and Dudley E. DeGroot conducted archaeological research to document historical and prehistorical aspects of two endangered properties that were listed on the National Register of Historic Places—the El Vernona Hotel (built by Owen Burns in 1925 and later renamed to John Ringling Hotel) and Seagate (a fishing retreat built for Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley Jr. in 1929) during efforts to protect the historic properties from demolition. Jerris Foote participated in both projects.\n\nToward the end of the decade, Benz participated in documentation of other archaeological and historical sites. She was cited as a special contributor to the survey of archaeological, historical, cultural, and natural resources in the coastal areas of Sarasota County that was conducted by the Florida department of environmental regulation as well as for recommending sites deserving further research.\nIn the late 1980s Benz founded Friends of Seagate Inc., which championed the preservation of the remaining portions of Seagate, a subdivision platted in 1925 that became the Crosleys' estate in 1929. The property was sold to the Horton family in 1948, and was purchased in the late 1970s for development into a club-based condominium project by the Campeau Corporation. Although the property had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, little protection is afforded through listing and Benz's concerns were for both historic preservation and environmental conservation. Unfortunately, the condominium market in Florida had collapsed shortly after Campeau acquired the property and the ambitious plans to use the 1929 home and auxiliary buildings as the clubhouse and headquarters of the development were never realized. Work permits were kept alive by intermittent, but unrelated and minimal construction until the corporation began to collapse. That collapse led to the demise of many of the most prestigious department stores in America—such as Bonwit Teller—having been acquired by the failing Federated Department Stores division that had become part of Campeau.\n\nThe Seagate property changed hands several times with several inglorious plans submitted for redevelopment that met with opposition until Friends of Seagate was founded and Benz's campaign for acquisition was begun, that resulted finally, in public acquisition. In 1990 the property was acquired by the state of Florida with a division into two portions, the bay front residence and being overseen by Manatee County and the much larger, eastern portion of the property along Tamiami Trail being overseen by New College and University of South Florida until their separation and the resulting development of this portion into a new campus only for the satellite, commuter campus of the university. Following the public acquisition of the property the objectives of Benz's organization were expanded to broader preservation issues involving archaeological, artistic, cultural, environmental, and historical aspects of the region. Lake Underwood, a patron to Friends of Seagate, provided much of the funding and equipment for the expansion of the organization.\nIn 2002, Benz also led Friends of Seagate Inc. in its commitment as the nonprofit environmental entity to hold land in a partnership with the Sarasota municipal government as the eligible local governmental entity, applying for a state grant for funding through the \"Florida Forever Program\", (Florida's premier conservation and recreation lands acquisition program) amounting to $1,505,625 for acquisition of \"Rus in Ur'be\", a large land parcel in the center of the Indian Beach Sapphire Shores neighborhood, as a neighborhood park. The parcel includes more than and contained a great deal of wooded and undeveloped land, wetlands, a tennis court, and a Sarasota School of Architecture structure that served as a private clubhouse or recreational lounge for a bay front home opposite it on Bay Shore Road that had been sold separately from the house and held for a long time by a developer. The clubhouse was roofed with glazed blue Japanese ceramic tiles, used pecky cypress timbers for framing, and had expansive glass partitions along the western elevation, facing the tennis courts. The project retained its status among those not able to be included for state funding in that cycle, but was sold for private development before the next cycle began. The structure was demolished and the tennis courts destroyed, plats for development with single family homes were surveyed, and a private road paved through the parcel, but no structures were built prior to the downturn of the real estate market as the speculation boom of the 1990s and 2000s collapsed. Several development projects have been proposed for the parcel. The property remained undeveloped through the next decade and often was identified as a likely location for a neighborhood park as other efforts continued. In 2014 the property was acquired out of foreclosure and may be destined for residential development.\n\nInterest in regional and local planning led Benz to participate in community planning projects, as well as the designs for the campuses of both New College and the University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee. She became a director of a large and active neighborhood association and assumed a leadership role in the community and many organizations related to community issues.\n\nShe was appointed as a local government official to represent Sarasota County while serving on the federally mandated \nSarasota-Manatee Metropolitan Planning Organization Citizen Advisory Committee, where she has served for many years, including as its chair, a member of its executive committee, and its delegate to the regional committee of the chairs of all MPOs within western central Florida, encompassing eight counties, the Chairs Coordinating Committee.\n\nThe establishment of MPOs throughout the nation as an aspect of local government in the United States was mandated by congressional legislation. Depending upon the area, the governance of an MPO may be planning for a single community, county-wide, multiple or bi-county-wide, or regional. The area of an MPO may cross other established jurisdictional lines of government. By federal law, any urbanized area with a population exceeding 50,000 is required to form an MPO to guide transportation planning in the metropolitan area. MPOs are funded by the federal government in conjunction with additional funds contributed by the state and local governments of the regions in which they are formed. The need for larger regional transportation planning co-operation has driven the establishment of additional agencies within the MPO structure, such as the Chairs Coordinating Committee, with much larger focus to draw the officials from the MPO organizations in many regions into the national effort to integrate transportation planning more effectively.\n\nAfter studying the work of the road engineering expert, Michael Wallwork, in the late 1980s she initiated the examination of a new design for road intersections, the modern roundabout, by the MPO and both county and city governments and has continued to advocate its application for the elimination of unnecessary deaths and serious injuries at conventional intersections, improving the environmental and beautification aspects of community designs, and because counterintuitively, they improve congestion issues by carrying larger volumes of traffic than conventional intersection designs.\n\nDecades later, the federal highway standards now support the use of true modern roundabouts and some states have begun requiring road planners to defend any proposal lacking this innovative intersection design. Insurance companies now advocate it as well, to reduce fatalities and injuries, and to prevent extensive damage to automobiles at intersection crashes.\n\nContributions by Benz to publications of organizations to which she has belonged include articles, design and layout, and illustrations as well as editing. She also has published privately many short stories, some of which include her own illustrations. Some have appeared in commercial media. The great majority of her published works are devoted to natural history, but some are devoted to history, biography, and historic preservation as well, featuring illustrations and details of the subject people and structures. Brochures and fliers she created on the latter topics have been distributed to encourage historic preservation and made available by local government and institutions owning the historical structures.\n\nOther professional experience for Kafi Benz has included commercial art, graphic design, and illustration; marketing, public relations, and corporate image development; real estate development; medical and research publication and editing for a Fortune-100 ethical pharmaceutical corporation, Novartis, that now ranks second in the multinational pharmaceutical industry; technical publication and editing for a regulatory agency of the federal government, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; ghost and speech writing; and electronic engineering product development, including the second generation of early personal computers while with Litton Industries.\n"}

It is a form of relative dating. In its plainest form, it states that in undeformed stratigraphic sequences, the oldest strata will be at the bottom of the sequence. This is important to stratigraphic dating, which assumes that the law of superposition holds true and that an object cannot be older than the materials of which it is composed.\n\nThe law of superposition was first proposed in the late 17th century by the Danish scientist Nicolas Steno. In the English-language literature, the law was popularized by William \"Strata\" Smith, who used it to produce the first geologic map of Britain. It is the first of Smith's laws.\n\nSuperposition in archaeology and especially in stratification use during excavation is slightly different as the processes involved in laying down archaeological strata are somewhat different from geological processes. Man-made intrusions and activity in the archaeological record need not form chronologically from top to bottom or be deformed from the horizontal as natural strata are by equivalent processes. Some archaeological strata (often termed as contexts or layers) are created by undercutting previous strata. An example would be that the silt back-fill of an underground drain would form some time after the ground immediately above it. Other examples of non vertical superposition would be modifications to standing structures such as the creation of new doors and windows in a wall.

The Portuguese patrols were carried out by small groups of soldiers from the Portuguese Marine Corps.\n\nWhen, in 1969, the Minister of Economy, Dias Rosas, argued against the system of financing organized to build the Cahora Bassa dam, which made the Portuguese State the guarantor of the work and left out South Africa's financial risks, which would be the main client, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Franco Nogueira, remarked that the dam was not business, but symbol of the will of the Portuguese to remain in Africa. The Minister of Economy, one of the government's technocrats, eventually resigned, after which the last illusions of rational investment were left with such arguments. The Cahora Bassa Dam is a classic example of the divorce between politics and strategy.\n\nAll the surrounding factors represented obvious and enormous risk: its deployment in war territory, a short distance of two hundred kilometres from the perilous border with Zambia, the six hundred kilometres separating it from the port of landing of the materials, Beira, and the eight hundred kilometres of the energy transport line in Mozambican territory, with 6,000 support posts. In addition, the energy produced by the dam could not be spent in Mozambique due to lack of installed industrial capacity and was not indispensable to its main destination, South Africa, since it had alternative sources. In short, Cahora Bassa was unnecessary as an energy producer, it was doubtful viability as an economic enterprise, and its construction and exploitation were at high risk.\n\nThe two sides of the conflict understood the construction of the dam as a challenge that would decide the fate of the war, since for the Portuguese regime it represented the affirmation of its vitality and, more than that, the transmission abroad of the certainty of being able to win that war. Politically, it would give the image of Portugal strong, capable of motivating international support and attract economic investments, which would translate into political commitments. For Frelimo, the construction of the dam and its normal exploitation would imply the image of weakness and inability to control the land and the populations. Worse than that, its success could be accompanied by the installation of about one million white settlers in the Zambezi valley, which would decisively alter the human environment of the zone where the movement acted.\n\nSignificantly, in the first interview he gave as Frelimo's president, Samora Machel, still in 1970, and before Kaulza de Arriaga launched Operation Gordian Node, he said that preventing the construction of the dam continued to be Frelimo's main objective. Cahora Bassa was thus transformed into the decisive goal that materialised the victory of the attacker or the defender. But before progressing to the construction of the dam, it was indispensable for the Government to obtain the guarantee, on the part of the military, of the security of the enterprise and the respective line of transport of energy.\n\nThe analysis of the situation, which led Defence Minister Sá Viana Rebelo in 1968 to respond positively to this question. As for the enemy, on a reasonable assessment of Frelimo's military potential, its objectives and areas of action, it seemed unlikely that in three years the guerrillas would have been able to travel eight hundred kilometres from their base in Tanzania to settle and to spread through the Tete area on the two banks of the Zambezi so as to oblige, in 1971, to affect almost half of the Portuguese troops in Mozambique to the safety of the dam.\n\nIt was admitted in the initial study that between the Zambezi River and the Zambian border some small guerrilla groups would be set up, which would make the area operationally identical to that of Niassa. The Portuguese staff was certain that on the southern bank of the river, whose frontier was controlled by Rhodesia, it would be impossible to develop significant actions on the part of Frelimo. In order to guarantee this scenario, it was enough to strengthen the area north of the Zambezi, which was done by placing battalions at Furancungo and Bene, whose mission was to prevent infiltrations from Zambia through the Capoche river valley. With regard to the safety of the eight hundred kilometres of power transmission line, they were running along the border with Rhodesia and South Africa, so there would be no serious problems in this field either.\n\nThe Portuguese optimism of 1968 was reinforced by the conviction that local populations are not very permeable to Frelimo propaganda, and still less available to organise and fight because they are peasants with little political awareness, they are dispersed and have some tradition of emigration to South Africa. This scenario changed radically in three years. In 1971, it was necessary for the Portuguese forces to install COFI, first in Chicoa and then in Estima, at the base of the mountains of Cahora Bassa, command of large operations.\n\nThe reason for changing the assumptions on which the previous analysis was based was, first and foremost, the acute awareness of the importance of the construction of the dam by Frelimo. The nationalist leaders quickly became aware of the danger it posed and began immediately to prepare the response. Their efforts at political penetration have been directed to this area, in a process in which they tried not to overlook them, but which provoked some confrontations with the traditional authorities, developed a network of contacts that assured them transit and installation facilities in Zambia, repositioned weapons and equipment and recognised objectives and berth of refuge. That is, they sought to provide a solid foundation for a response that they knew was not easy. Frelimo's preparatory actions in Tete underwent a significant evolution in 1970.\n\nThe arrival of General Kaulza de Arriaga and the major operations he set in the north forced the movement to withdraw from the Planalto dos Macondes some of its staff, which were available for use in other areas . Tete has become your destination. On the other hand, the large concentration of Portuguese forces in the North further alleviated the military pressure in that zone, which was used by Frelimo to pass as many personnel and equipment to the south of the Zambezi as possible. At the beginning of 1971, three hundred guerrillas entered Mozambique to reach Zumbo near the border with Rhodesia and then progressed towards Zobué, on the border with Malawi, and engulfed Angonia from the south. The conditions were thus met for Frelimo to start actions in the Tete area as soon as Operation Gordian Node ended, which forced the transfer of Portuguese forces in the North. In fact, the great operations of Kaúlza de Arriaga in the Planalto dos Macondes will accelerate the decision of Frelimo to increase the fight in Tete.\n\nBy early 1971, the data had already been released. The main board playing the war in Mozambique was Tete and Cahora Bassa, with their umbilical cord, the Beira corridor, at a time when Portuguese troops were still deeply involved in Operation Frontier with Rovuma. As of 1971, the Cahora Bassa dam now requires the mobilisation of an increasing volume of means to defend it. The military device mounted aims to achieve three objectives: - Defend Cahora Bassa through the Cahora Bassa Defence Operational Command (CODCB); - Guarantee the transportation of materials through the Command of Critical Loads; - Prevent the spread of Frelimo south of the Zambezi River, and protect the future energy transport line through COFI and an ever-tightening mesh grid. The facility was continuously strengthened with regular, interventional units, GE and GEP, and the area underwent successive refurbishments, culminating in the creation of the Tete Operational Zone (ZOT) in May 1971.\n\nIn 1973, an advanced command of the Territorial Command of the Center, in Vila Gouveia, with the explicit mission of trying to stop the progression of Frelimo further south, a threat that was already being drawn.\n\nUntil 1974, the situation in Tete would not be aggravated by the progress of Frelimo's activities in areas nearer to Beira, but the awareness of the Portuguese military was so strong that its decisive objective was to secure the conclusion of the with which they had committed themselves, who had always understood that they were complying with it by avoiding significant disturbances in their work, despite the fact that their enemy had already forced them to concentrate around them more than 50 per cent of the total workforce in Mozambique, to have them involved in a war of attrition in which, with increasing frequency, they were confronted with delicate situations against black populations, religious authorities and in which they were discredited before the white settlers. Frelimo, with an economic war on casualties, was expanding its activities around Cahora Bassa and threatened to control the Isthmus of Beira, which would separate northern South Mozambique, by taking action in Vila Pery, Vila Gouveia and Inhaminga. Cahora Bassa, who had been presented as a symbol of victory, was finally bringing the war to the heart of Mozambique and accelerating its outcome.\n"}

He went to Paris to study classical composition, and by the 1930s had become an established jazz pianist, arranger, and writer of popular songs; around this time he began composing film scores, with his first known work being for Jean Renoir's first sound film, \"On purge bébé\", for which he was uncredited.\n\nLike Renoir, Misraki fled France during the World War II German occupation. After a brief stay in Argentina, Misraki ended up in Hollywood, where he composed the music to all of Renoir's American films. After the war, Misraki returned to France, working busily throughout the 1950s, a period when he was routinely scoring half a dozen or more films a year. These included numerous films by Yves Allégret and Jean Boyer, as well as two films by Jacques Becker (\"\" and \"Montparnasse 19\") and Orson Welles' \"Mr. Arkadin\".\n\nThe 1960s saw Misraki slow down slightly, writing only 2-3 scores a year. During this period, he worked with many of the leading French directors of the period, including Jean-Luc Godard (on \"Alphaville\"), Jean-Pierre Melville (on \"Le Doulos\") and Claude Chabrol, for whom he scored several films.\n\nMisraki composed intermittently throughout the last two decades of his life. He composed his last score at age 85; by this point he had been working almost exclusively in television for several years. He died of natural causes at age 90 in Paris.\n\nMisraki first found acclaim as a composer and lyricist of popular songs.

Misraki was an early proponent of the ancient astronaut hypothesis. In 1962 Misraki published his book \"Les Extraterrestres\" in France which was later reprinted in English under the title of \"Flying Saucers Through The Ages\" in 1965, he first published the book under the pen name of \"Paul Thomas\" as he believed that if his real identity was revealed, his reputation as a musician might be damaged; however, he later revealed his identity, and a number of American editions of the book were published under his real name. In the book, Misraki claimed that angels from the Bible were aliens, that the Bible and other ancient texts are filled with many UFO flying saucer sightings, and that throughout human history there was intervention from extraterrestrial aliens. Misraki was also one of the first authors to suggest that apparitions may be UFO related phenomena. The Ufologist Jacques Vallée studied some of Misraki's UFO theories and visited Misraki in Paris in September 1962 to discuss them with him, in his journals Vallée described Misraki as a \"deeply reflective man\" and a \"religious scholar\".\n\nMisraki was also a supporter of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and his theory of omega point, and wrote a number of papers on his work.\n\n"}

The area was first settled in 1834 by freed African-American slaves and freeborn African Americans primarily from the U.S. state of Maryland, under the auspices of the Maryland State Colonization Society. \n\nThe larger American Colonization Society was founded in 1816; it supported the settlement of thousands of free African Americans to their colony based in Monrovia in West Africa, along the coast. There were also initially separate settlements founded by state colonization societies of Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Louisiana. In 1838, these African-American settlements were united into the Commonwealth of Liberia, which declared its independence from the American Colonization Society in July 26, 1847. The Maryland colony remained separate from Commonwealth of Liberia, as the colonization society wished to maintain its trade monopoly in the area. On February 2, 1841, Maryland-in-Africa became the Independent State of Maryland. Following an independence referendum in 1853, the state declared its independence on May 29, 1854 under the name Maryland in Liberia, with its capital at Harper.\n\nThe American Colonization Society had been founded in 1816, in part due to alarms over the violence of the Haitian slave revolution and its aftermath, which resulted in independence for that country in 1804. Fears were raised about the effects of emancipation of slaves in the United States. \n\nIn this period, both slaveholders and abolitionists collaborated on the project to transport free blacks to Africa, though for different purposes. They suggested it was \"repatriation\" but by this point, most African Americans were native-born in the United States. Slaveholders believed that free blacks threatened the stability of slave societies. Abolitionists hoped to encourage slaveholders to free their slaves and also worried about the discrimination faced by free blacks in the United States. Those who supported relocation to West Africa believed the African-Americans might be able to form a better society for themselves there, away from white discrimination. While thousands of free blacks did relocate to the colony, most free African-Americans opposed this project, claiming their native-born status in the United States and wanting to mitigate inequities there.\n\nMaryland had an increasing proportion of free blacks among its African-American population. During the first two decades after the Revolution, about 25% of blacks were freed, in part because slaveholders were inspired by the war's ideals. Practically, changing labor needs meant that fewer slaves were required. By 1810 some 30% of northern Maryland's blacks were free, in what was a more urbanized region, but so were 20% of blacks in the southern part of the state. In the next two decades the number of free blacks increased markedly in the northern part of the state, and many congregated to Baltimore, the state's and the South's largest city. By 1830 Maryland had a total of 52,938 free blacks: 51.3% of blacks in northern Maryland were free, and the black population of Baltimore was 75% free. In southern Maryland, free blacks made up 24.7% of the black population.\n\nThe Maryland State Colonization Society was originally a branch of the American Colonization Society, which had founded the colony of Liberia at Monrovia on January 7, 1822. The Maryland Society decided to establish a new settlement of its own to accommodate its emigrants and with the intention of controlling trade to the colony. In December 1831, the Maryland state legislature in the United States appropriated US$10,000 for 26 years to transport 10,000 free blacks and ex-slaves, and 400 Caribbean slaves from the United States and the Caribbean islands, respectively, to Africa. It founded the Maryland State Colonization Society for this purpose. \n\nThe first area in the Republic of Maryland to be settled by the Maryland Colonization Society was Cape Palmas, in 1834, somewhat south of the rest of the American colony. The Cape is a small, rocky peninsula connected to the mainland by a sandy isthmus. Immediately to the west of the peninsula is the estuary of the Hoffman River. Approximately 21 km (15 mi) along the coast to the east, the Cavalla River empties into the sea, marking the border between Liberia and the Ivory Coast. It marks the western limit of the Gulf of Guinea, according to the International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO).\n\nMost of the settlers were freed African-American slaves and freeborn African Americans primarily from the state of Maryland. The Colonization Society organizers thought they could establish new trading ties by relocating African Americans to West Africa. The colony was named Maryland In Africa (also known as Maryland in Liberia) on February 12, 1834.\n\nIn 1836 the colony appointed its first black governor, John Brown Russwurm (1799–1851), who served as governor for more than a dozen years until his death. Russwurm encouraged the immigration of African Americans to Maryland in Africa, and supported agriculture and trade. He had begun his career working as the colonial secretary for the American Colonization Society between 1830 and 1834. He also worked as the editor of the \"Liberia Herald.\" He resigned this post in 1835 to protest America's colonization policies.\n\nIn 1838, a number of other American settlements on the west coast of Africa united to form the Commonwealth of Liberia, which declared its independence in July 26, 1847. \n\nThe colony of Maryland in Liberia remained independent, as the Maryland State Colonization Society wished to maintain its trade monopoly in the area. On February 2, 1841, Maryland-in-Africa was granted statehood and became the State of Maryland. In 1847 the Maryland State Colonization Society published the \"Constitution and Laws of Maryland in Liberia\", based on the United States Constitution.\n\nOn May 29, 1854, the State of Maryland declared its independence, naming itself Maryland in Liberia, with its capital at Harper. It was also known as the Republic of Maryland. It held the land along the coast between the Grand Cess and San Pedro rivers. It lasted three years as an independent state.\n\nSoon afterward, local tribes including the Grebo and the Kru attacked the State of Maryland in retaliation for its disruption of the slave trade, by which they had profited. Unable to maintain its own defense, Maryland appealed for help to Liberia, its more powerful neighbor. President Roberts sent military assistance, and an alliance of Marylanders and Liberian militia troops successfully repelled the local tribesmen. The Republic of Maryland recognized that it could not survive as an independent state, and following a referendum, Maryland was annexed by Liberia on April 6, 1857, becoming known as Maryland County.\n\nA statue of John Brown Russwurm was erected at his burial site at Harper, Cape Palmas, Liberia.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1394108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1394108", "title": "Root race", "text": "Root race\n\nRoot races are stages in human evolution in the esoteric cosmology of theosophist Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, as described in her book \"The Secret Doctrine\" (1888). These races existed mainly on now-lost continents. Blavatsky's model was developed by later theosophists, most notably William Scott-Elliot in \"The Story of Atlantis\" (1896) and \"The Lost Lemuria\" (1904). Annie Besant further developed the model in (1913). Both Besant and Scott-Elliot relied on information from Charles Webster Leadbeater obtained by \"astral clairvoyance\". Further elaboration was provided by Rudolf Steiner in \"Atlantis and Lemuria\" (1904). Rudolf Steiner, and subsequent theosophist authors, have called the time periods associated with these races, Epochs (Steiner felt that the term \"race\" was not adequate anymore for modern humanity).\n\nAccording to historian James Webb, the occult concept of succeeding prehistoric races, as later adopted by Blavatsky, was first introduced by the French author Antoine Fabre d'Olivet in his \"Histoire philosophique du genre humain\" (1824). By contrast, historian Goffe Jensma claims that the concept of root races was first articulated in the Dutch esotericist book Oera Linda, which was translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876. Also prior to Blavatsky, the root races were described by the English theosophist Alfred Percy Sinnett in \"Esoteric Buddhism\" (1883).\n\nSome post-theosophical writers, attempting to reconcile current geological science with some earlier theosophical teachings, have equated Lemuria with the former supercontinent of Gondwana, but this is not theosophy. Early theosophical teachings agree with the original statements of Eduard Suess, who argued that Gondwanaland consisted of parts of the present continents in their present positions, but joined to one another by other lands that have since been submerged. This is also the position of Master Samael Aun Weor.\n\nAtlantis, in the Theosophical cosmology, was a continent that covered a significant part of what is now the Atlantic Ocean. The large continent of Atlantis is said to have \"first divided, and then broken later on into seven peninsulas and islands\". When the main part of Atlantis began to sink, Atlantean settlers migrated to the new lands which were rising to the east, west, and south. These new lands became the Americas, Africa, parts of Asia, and the present European countries, stretching from the Ural Mountains of Russia, westward to include the islands of Ireland and Britain, and even farther westward than that in former times. Some emigrants from the remaining islands in the Atlantic settled on new islands to the east which later consolidated into what is now the district of the Abyssinian highlands and lands somewhat to the north. Atlantis perished through flooding and submergence in 9,564 BC, and its destruction is explained by claiming successive disturbances in the axial rotation of Earth which caused earthquakes, which led to the sudden sinking of Atlantis.\n\nAccording to Blavatsky's writings, there will be seven root races assembled for our Earth; each root race is divided into seven subraces. Only five root races have appeared so far; the sixth is expected to emerge in the 28th century. Francis Bacon (whom theosophy considers to be the legendary Count of St. Germain) in his work \"The New Atlantis\" (1627) describes a potential future civilisation which lives on a land called Bensalem.\n\nThe first root race was \"ethereal\", i.e. they were composed of etheric matter. They reproduced by dividing like an amoeba. Earth was still cooling at that time. The first mountain to arise out of the stormy primeval ocean was Mount Meru.\n\nThe second root race lived in Hyperborea. The second root race was colored golden yellow. Hyperborea included what is now Northern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Northern Asia and Kamchatka. The climate was tropical because Earth had not yet developed an axial tilt. The esoteric name of their continent is \"Plaksha\"; they called themselves the \"Kimpurshas\". They reproduced by budding.\n\nThe third root race, the Lemurian lived in Lemuria. The esoteric name of Lemuria is \"Shalmali\". Lemuria, according to Theosophists, existed in a large part of what is now the Indian Ocean including Australia and extending into the South Pacific Ocean; its last remnants are the Australian continent, the island of New Guinea, and the island of Madagascar. Lemuria sank gradually and was eventually destroyed by incessantly erupting volcanoes. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was thought by geologists that the age of the earth was only about 200 million years (because radioactive dating had not yet come into use), so the geological epochs were believed to have occurred at a much later time than is thought to be the case today. According to traditional Theosophy, the Lemurian root race began 34½ million years ago, in the middle of what was then believed to be the Jurassic; thus, the people of Lemuria coexisted with the dinosaurs. The Lemurian race was much taller and bigger than our current race. The first three subraces of the Lemurians reproduced by laying eggs, but the fourth subrace, beginning 16½ million years ago, began to reproduce like modern humans. As Lemuria was slowly submerged due to volcanic eruptions, the Lemurians colonized the areas surrounding Lemuria, i.e. Africa, Southern India and the East Indies. The descendants of the Lemurian root race, according to traditional Theosophy, include the Capoid race, the Congoid race, the Dravidians, and the Australoid race.\n\nThis race inhabited Atlantis.\n\nThe fourth root race, the Atlantean, according to Theosophy arose approximately 4,500,000 years ago in Africa from the fourth subrace of the Lemurians in a part of Africa that had been colonized by that subrace in the area now inhabited by the Ashanti. According to Theosophists the first Atlantean subrace was the result of the last, or seventh Lemurian subrace, Chankshusha Manu, which migrated first to the south of the Atlantean continent and, from there, migrated further north. The esoteric name of Atlantis is \"Kusha\". The Atlantean root race had Mongolian features; they began with bronze skin and gradually evolved into the red American Indian, brown Malayan, and yellow Mongolian races, because some Atlanteans eventually migrated to the Americas and Asia. The seven subraces of the Atlantean root race were\n\nThe descendants of the Atlanteans according to traditional Theosophy include those of the Mongolian race, the Malayan race, and the American Indian race as well as some people of what in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was called the \"olive-skinned\" Mediterranean race.\n\nDuring the long period of time when Atlantis was ruled by the Toltecs (the ancestors of the Amerindians), the civilization of Atlantis was at its height. This was the period between about 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago, called the \"Golden Age of Atlantis\". The Atlanteans had many luxuries and conveniences. Their capital city was called \"The City of the Golden Gates\". At its height, it had two million inhabitants. There were extensive aqueducts leading to the city from a mountain lake. The Atlanteans had airships powered by the vril that could seat two to eight people. The economic system was socialist like that of the Incas. Atlanteans were the first to develop organized warfare. The military deployed vril-powered air battleships that contained 50 to 100 fighting men. These air battleships deployed poison gas bombs. The infantry fired fire-tipped arrows. The Toltecs on Atlantis worshipped the Sun in temples as grand as those of ancient Egypt that were decorated in bright colors. The sacred word used in meditation was Tau (this was the equivalent of the Aryan sacred word Om). As noted above, the Toltecs colonized all of North America and South America and thus became the people we know as the Amerindians. The downfall of Atlantis started when some of the Toltecs began to practice black magic about 850,000 BC, corrupted by the dragon \"Thevetat\", remembered as Devadatta, the opponent of Buddha. The people began to become selfish and materialistic. Soon thereafter, the Turanians (the ancestors of the people we now know as the Turkic peoples) became dominant in much of Atlantis. The Turanians continued the practice of black magic which reached its height about 250,000 BC and continued until the final sinking of Atlantis, although they were opposed by white magicians. The Master Morya incarnated as the Emperor of Atlantis in 220,000 BC to oppose the black magicians. The black magicians used magical spells to breed human-animal chimeras to use as sex slaves. They also had an army composed of chimeras that were composites composed of a human body with the heads of fierce predators such as lions, tigers and bears, that ate enemy corpses on the battlefield. The war between the white magicians and the black magicians continued until the end of Atlantis. The Masters of the Ancient Wisdom telepathically warned their disciples (the white magicians) to flee Atlantis in ships while there was still time to get out before the final cataclysm. As noted above, the final sudden submergence of Atlantis due to earthquakes occurred in 9,564 BC .\n\nBlavatsky asserted humanity was in the fifth root race, the Aryan race, which Theosophists believe to have emerged from the previous fourth root race (Atlantean root race) beginning about 100,000 years ago in Atlantis. (According to Powell, when Madame Blavatsky stated the Aryan root race was 1,000,000 years old, she meant that the souls of the people that later physically incarnated as the first Aryans about 100,000 years ago began to incarnate in the bodies of Atlanteans 1,000,000 years ago. However, another way of interpreting this is that Nature began to create the Aryan race before the final cataclysms.) Theosophists believe the Aryan root race was physically progenerated by the Vaivasvatu Manu, one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. The present-day ethnic group most closely related to the new race is the Kabyle. The small band of only 9,000 people constituting the then small Aryan root race migrated out of Atlantis in 79,797 BC. The bards of the new white root-race poetically referred to the new race as being \"moon-colored\". A small group of these Aryan migrants from Atlantis split from the main body of migrants and went south to the shore of an inland sea in what was then a verdant and lush Sahara where they founded the \"City of the Sun\". The main body of migrants continued onwards to an island called the \"white island\" in the middle of what was then an inland sea in what is now the Gobi desert, where they established the \"City of the Bridge\". (The \"City of the Bridge\" was constructed directly below the etheric city called Shamballa where Theosophists believe the governing deity of Earth, Sanat Kumara, dwells; thus, the ongoing evolution of the Aryan root race has been divinely guided by the being Theosophists call \"The Lord of the World\".)\n\nThe esoteric name of the whole of the present land surface of Earth, i.e. the World Island, the Americas, the Australian continent and Antarctica taken as a whole is \"Krauncha\".\n\nGenerally speaking, a large percentage of the people who live in the time of the period of the fifth root race are part of the fifth root race. However Blavatsky also opines that some Semitic peoples have become \"degenerate in spirituality\". She asserted that some peoples descended from the Lemurians are \"semi-animal creatures\". These latter include \"the Tasmanians, a portion of the Australians and a mountain tribe in China.\" There are also \"considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean peoples produced by various crossings with such semi-human stocks -- e.g., the wild men of Borneo, the Veddhas of Ceylon, most of the remaining Australians, Bushmen, Negritos, Andaman Islanders, etc.\" All these aforementioned groups mentioned by Blavatsky except the purported \"wild men of Borneo\" (not to be confused with the famous circus duo, the Wild Men of Borneo) are part of what was in the late 19th and most of the 20th century was called the Australoid race (except for the Bushmen, part of the Capoid race), both of which races, as noted above, were believed by traditional Theosophists to have been descended from the Lemurians.\n\nBlavatsky described the fifth root race with the following words: \"\"The Aryan races, for instance, now varying from dark brown, almost black, red-brown-yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour, are yet all of one and the same stock – the Fifth Root-Race – and spring from one single progenitor\", which Hindus call Manu. Theosophists believe that each root race has a separate and distinct progenitor.\n\nThe subraces of the Aryan Fifth Root Race include the first subrace, the Hindu, which migrated from the \"City of the Bridge\" on the white island in the middle of the Gobi inland sea to India in 60,000 BC; the second subrace, the Arabian, which migrated from the \"City of the Bridge\" to Arabia in 40,000 BC; the third subrace, the Persian, which migrated from the \"City of the Bridge\" to Persia in 30,000 BC; the fourth subrace, the Celts, which migrated from the \"City of the Bridge\" to Western Europe beginning in 20,000 BC (the Mycenaean Greeks are regarded as an offshoot of the Celtic subrace that colonized Southeast Europe); and the fifth subrace, the Teutonic, which also migrated from the \"City of the Bridge\" to what is now Germany beginning in 20,000 BC (the Slavs are regarded as an offshoot of the Teutonic subrace that colonized Russia and surrounding areas).\n\nAccording to Blavatsky the sixth subrace of the Aryan root race will begin to evolve in the area of the United States in the early 21st century. This sixth subrace of the Aryan root race will be called the \"Australo-American subrace\" and is believed by Theosophists to be now arising from the Teutonic subrace of the Aryan root race in Australia and in the Western United States (many individuals of the new subrace will be born in California) and its surrounding nearby areas (i.e., the Australo-American subrace is in arising from the Anglo-American, Anglo-Canadian, Anglo-Australian and presumably also the Anglo-New Zealander ethnic groups). The sixth or Australo-American sub-race will \"possess certain psychic powers, and for this the pituitary body will be developed, thus giving an additional sense, that of cognising astral emotions in the ordinary waking consciousness. We may say that in general the sixth sub-race will bring in wisdom and intuition, blending all that is best in the intelligence of the fifth subrace and the emotion of the fourth.\"\n\nAccording to C. W. Leadbeater, a colony will be established in Baja California by the Theosophical Society under the guidance of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in the 28th century for the intensive selective eugenic breeding of the sixth root race. The Master Morya will physically incarnate in order to be the Manu (\"progenitor\") of this new root race. By that time, the world will be powered by nuclear power and there will be a single world government led by a person who will be the reincarnation of Julius Caesar. Tens of thousands of years in the future, a new continent will arise in the Pacific Ocean that will be the future home of the sixth root race. California west of the San Andreas Fault will break off from the mainland of North America and become the Island of California off the eastern coast of the new continent.\n\nVictor Skumin proposed a definition and classification of Homo spiritalis (Latin: \"spiritual man\"), the sixth root race, consisting of eight subraces (subspecies): HS0 Anabiosis spiritalis, HS1 Scientella spiritalis, HS2 Aurora spiritalis, HS3 Ascensus spiritalis, HS4 Vocatus spiritalis, HS5 Illuminatio spiritalis, НS6 Creatio spiritalis, and HS7 Servitus spiritalis.\n\nThe seventh root race will arise from the seventh subrace of the sixth root race on the future continent that the sixth root race will be living on that will arise from the Pacific Ocean. The continent they will inhabit is esoterically called \"Pushkara\".\n\nIt is believed by some Neo-Theosophists that after the present round of human spiritual evolution by reincarnation of souls in root races is completed several dozen million years from now, the human race will migrate to the planet Mercury to continue its spiritual and physical evolution.\n\nModern writers within theosophy or influenced by theosophy defend Blavatsky's use of the terms Aryan race and root race as \"not connected to demagogic ideas\". They say that the classification of humanity into races is still practiced today and that Blavatsky and subsequent esoteric philosophers who expressed similar lines of thought intended a Universal Brotherhood of humanity. Yet root race philosophy is not void of directly biologically racial elements.\n\nBlavatsky promulgated her ideology in a layered, multidimensional style and way, and paradoxical truth was key to her metaphysics. Seemingly paradoxical statements underpin root race theoretic philosophy existing beyond bifurcations of \"liberal\" or \"illiberal\" notions. Blavatsky wrote that, while \"all men have spiritually and physically the same origin\" and that \"mankind is essentially of one and the same essence\"—nevertheless, in \"The Secret Doctrine\", Blavatsky posits: \"Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence.\" The interrelationship between spirituality and root race developmental history is nonlinear and complex. Thus: \"Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter (The Chinese, Africans, etc..) gradually brought the worship back.\" \n\nThe first aim of the Theosophical Society she founded is \"To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour\", and her writings also include references emphasizing the unity of humanity: \"all men have spiritually and physically the same origin\" and that \"mankind is essentially of one and the same essence\".\n\nCranston quoted Blavatsky saying that in reality there is no inferior or low-grade races because all of it are one common humankind. \n\n"}

{"id": "38888204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38888204", "title": "Tallinn Manual", "text": "Tallinn Manual\n\nThe Tallinn Manual (originally entitled, \"Tallinn Manual on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare\") is an academic, non-binding study on how international law (in particular the jus ad bellum and international humanitarian law) applies to cyber conflicts and cyber warfare. Between 2009 and 2012, the \"Tallinn Manual\" was written at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence by an international group of approximately twenty experts. In April 2013, the manual was published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nIn late 2009, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence convened an international group of legal scholars and practitioners to draft a manual addressing the issue of how to interpret international law in the context of cyber operations and cyber warfare. As such, it was the first effort to analyse this topic comprehensively and authoritatively and to bring some degree of clarity to the associated complex legal issues.\n\nCollectively calling themselves the International Group of Experts, the authors of the \"Tallinn Manual\" include highly respected legal scholars and legal practitioners with experience in cyber issues who were consulted throughout the duration of the project by information technology specialists. The group was led by Professor Michael N. Schmitt, chairman of the international law department at the United States Naval War College, who also served as the project director. Other members of the group included Professor Wolff Heintschel von Heinegg from Viadrina European University, Air Commodore (ret.) William H. Boothby from the United Kingdom Royal Air Force, Professor Thomas C. Wingfield from the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, Bruno Demeyere formerly from the Catholic University of Leuven, Professor Eric Talbot Jensen from Brigham Young University, Professor Sean Watts from Creighton University, Dr. Louise Arimatsu from Chatham House, Captain (Navy) Geneviève Bernatchez from the office of the judge advocate general of the Canadian Forces, Colonel Penny Cumming from the Australian Defence Force, Professor Robin Geiss from the University of Potsdam, Professor Terry D. Gill from the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands Defence Academy, and Utrecht University, Professor Derek Jinks from the University of Texas, Professor Jann Kleffner from the Swedish National Defence College, Dr. Nils Melzer from the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, and Brigadier General (ret.) Kenneth Watkin from the Canadian Forces. The technical advisors were Professor James Bret Michael from the United States Naval Postgraduate School as well as Dr. Kenneth Geers and Dr. Rain Ottis, both of whom previously were associated with the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.\n\nThree organisations were represented by observers throughout the drafting process: NATO through its Allied Command Transformation due to the relationship of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence with NATO, the International Committee of the Red Cross because of its “guardian” role of international humanitarian law, and United States Cyber Command due to its ability to provide the perspective of an operationally mature entity. To add to the academic credibility of the \"Tallinn Manual\", prior to publication it was peer-reviewed by thirteen international legal scholars.\n\nWhen a draft of the \"Tallinn Manual\" was posted on the web site of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, it immediately drew the attention of the legal community as well as online media outlets reporting mainly on technology questions. Furthermore, after its official publication on March 15, 2013 at Chatham House, the issue of international law and how that governs cyber warfare was discussed widely among international media with references to the manual.\n\nAlthough frequently referred to as a NATO manual, this is incorrect. The \"Tallinn Manual\" is an independent academic research product representing only the views of its authors in their personal capacity. The manual does not represent the views of NATO nor any other organisation or state, including those represented by the observers. Being the first authoritative restatement of the application and interpretation of international law in the cyber context, however, it may be anticipated that the manual will have an effect on how states and organisations will formulate their approaches and positions in those matters.\n\nThe practice of producing non-binding manuals on the application of international humanitarian law is not new. The \"Tallinn Manual\" followed in the footsteps of similar efforts, such as the International Institute of Humanitarian Law’s San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea and the Harvard Program on Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research’s Manual on International Law Applicable to Air and Missile Warfare.\n\nThe manual is divided into sections referred to as “black letter rules” and their accompanying commentary. Essentially, the rules are restatements of international law in the cyber context, as understood and agreed to, by all of the authors. Since the adoption of any rule required consensus among the authors (not including the observers) the commentary attached to each rule serves a critical purpose of outlining differences of opinion as to the precise application of the rule. The commentary also identifies the legal basis of the rules, explains their normative content, and addresses practical implications in the cyber context.\n\nTallinn 2.0, which followed the original manual, was designed to expand the scope of the \"Tallinn Manual\". Tallinn 2.0 was released in February 2017 and published by Cambridge University Press in the form of a book.<ref name=\"http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/law/humanitarian-law/tallinn-manual-20-international-law-applicable-cyber-operations-2nd-edition?format=PB#y2Xr611vIwu3vIey.97\"> Cambridge University Press, February 2017</ref><ref name=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/02/09/what-tallinn-manual-2-0-teaches-us-about-the-new-cyber-order/#2e000999928b\"> Leetaru, Kalev. \"Forbes\". \"What Tallinn Manual 2.0 teaches us about the new cyber order.\" Retrieved 15 June, 2017</ref>\n\nThe focus of the original \"Tallinn Manual\" is on the most disruptive and destructive cyber operations—those that qualify as ‘armed attacks’ and therefore allowing states to respond in self-defense—and those taking place during armed conflict. Since the threat of cyber operations with such consequences is especially alarming to states, most academic research has focused on these issues. Tallinn 2.0 refers to cyber \"operations\" as opposed to cyber \"conflict\" from the original Tallinn Manual.<ref name=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/02/09/what-tallinn-manual-2-0-teaches-us-about-the-new-cyber-order/#2e000999928b\"> Leetaru, Kalev. \"Forbes\". \"What Tallinn Manual 2.0 teaches us about the new cyber order.\" Retrieved 15 June, 2017</ref>\n\nStates are challenged daily, however, by malevolent cyber operations that do not rise to the aforementioned level. The Tallinn 2.0 project examines the international legal framework that applies to such cyber operations. The relevant legal regimes include the law of state responsibility, the law of the sea, international telecommunications law, space law, diplomatic and consular law, and, with respect to individuals, human rights law. Tallinn 2.0 also explores how the general principles of international law, such as sovereignty, jurisdiction, due diligence, and the prohibition of intervention, apply in the cyber context.\n\nA senior fellow at the centre, Professor Michael Schmitt from the United States Naval War College and the University of Exeter, directs the Tallinn 2.0 project. Ms. Liis Vihul of the centre serves as its project manager. A team of legal and IT experts from the centre supports the effort.

For events pertaining to the conflict which occurred before 27 December 2009, see Gaza War (2008–09)#Background and 2007–2008 Israel–Gaza conflict.\n\nIsraeli armed forces began operations against Hamas and the rocket launchers at 11:30 a.m., 27 December. More than 50 fighter jets and attack helicopters entered Gazan airspace. Palestinian sources said that Israeli forces were responsible for killing 225-292 Palestinians and wounding more than 1,000. It was the most extensive attack on Gaza since 1967. The IAF, which said that it was responding to Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel, dropped more than 100 bombs on 50 targets, which reportedly included Hamas paramilitary bases, training camps, and underground Qassam rocket launchers. Bombs were dropped on government offices, police stations, and the Hamas headquarters.\n\nThe aircraft used were F-16 fighter jets and AH-64 Apache helicopters. About 140 members of Hamas security forces were killed, including police chief Tawfiq Jabber, the head of Hamas’ security and protection unit and the police commander for central Gaza, along with at least 15 civilians. Children were among the casualties. The bombed areas included a ceremony for new police officers. About 40 graduates were killed. A mosque in Gaza City was also targeted in the airstrikes and two Palestinians were killed. Israeli military spokesmen said that the mosque was being used for \"terrorist activities\".\n\nSixty Israeli planes also targeted Hamas security and military training compounds, as well as weapon storage buildings, and dropped more than 100 tons of bombs. Some of the bombs used on 27 and 28 December were the U.S. built GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb, the first shipment of which arrived in Israel at the beginning of the month.\n\nHamas later fired 700 rockets and mortars at Israel. One of the rockets hit the town of Netivot, killing an Israeli man, destroying a house and wounding six other people.\nAnother rocket hit a synagogue in the Eshkol Regional Council, injuring two men, one seriously.\nIn the evening two men in the Israeli community of Mivtahim were injured, one seriously, by a direct hit by a Hamas rocket.\n\nAccording to United Nations officials, fuel deliveries to the Gaza Strip through the Nahal Oz crossing were suspended, with the last delivery taking place a day previous on 26 December.\n\nMany Palestinians refer to 27 December as the \"Massacre of the Black Saturday\" as it produced the highest one-day death toll in 60 years of conflict.\n\nTwenty-five airstrikes were carried out on Sunday by Israel, raising the number of casualties to 287 dead and 900 wounded. According to the Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Hamas refused to allow casualties to leave Gaza for medical treatment.\nOne rocket shot by an F-16 fighter jet on a mosque near Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, from which rockets were reported by Israeli media to be launched, killed four members of Hamas. In Gaza City, five children from the same family were killed in an Israeli airstrike.\nIsraeli jets bombed tunnels in the Rafah area. These tunnels were reportedly used to smuggle civilian goods and weapons after Israel and Egypt imposed the blockade of Gaza in June 2007. The main road of Sallah el-Dein in northern Gaza Strip was bombed. The road leads to the towns of Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia and Jabalia. No injuries were reported in the bombing.\n\nAn Israeli air-to-ground rocket destroyed a metal workshop in northern Gaza City which, according to Israel, was used in manufacturing Qassam rockets fired at Israel. The Al-Noor organisation in Gaza City, belonging to the Hamas organization, was bombed, causing severe damage to the building.\nThe main building of the Hamas-owned Al-Aqsa TV station was struck. The station continued broadcasting via a \"mobile unit\". Aidan White, Secretary-General of the International Federation of Journalists condemned the destruction of the television station, stating that international law \"forbids attacks on media installations, even when they are instruments of propaganda\". The IAF attacked Jabalia and northern Gaza killing two more people and wounding others.\n\nAl Saraya, a building in Gaza City which contained government offices, security offices and a prison, was attacked. Four people died. A fuel lorry traveling in Rafah near the Egyptian border was destroyed, killing six people.\nIDF also confirmed an attack on tunnels in Philadelphi Route and claimed successful destruction of 40 of them. Missiles also hit near the Beit Hanoun City Hall.\n\nRockets were fired from the Gaza Strip, the range of which were extended. Three rockets landed near the city of Ashdod – the fifth largest Israeli city and a main sea port.\nThe border with Egypt was breached and inhabitants from Gaza moved into Egypt. One Egyptian border policeman was killed by Palestinian gunmen, and several Palestinians were wounded by Egyptian gunfire and taken to hospital in Egypt.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council held a closed door meeting convened at the request of Libya. The meeting lasted four hours, and resulted in a press statement calling \"on the parties to stop immediately all military activities ... [and] to address the serious humanitarian and economic needs in Gaza and to take necessary measures, including opening of border crossings.\"\n\nOn the eve of the ground incursion by Israeli forces, Khaled Mashal assured that should IDF launch ground offensive, black destiny and abduction awaits Israeli soldiers. Hamas spokesman added that with the God's help Gaza will become a graveyard to Israeli troops.\n\nAir strikes on the Strip continued. Just after midnight on 29 December, Israeli forces made six separate airstrikes against the Islamic University of Gaza, a \"cultural symbol\" of Hamas, though the university had evacuated days in advance. According to The Jerusalem Post, the university hosts Hamas military laboratories under the auspices of professors and its buildings were used for storing rockets and explosives. According to the IDF and the Shin Bet, one compound near the Islamic college, which was bombed twice, was being used as a chemical lab and as a Hamas explosives lab; Israel said that Hamas had been working to improve rockets and manufacture mortar shells. Israel asserted that the university chemistry laboratory was a \"fair target\", even if it could not show conclusively that those inside the laboratory at the time of the attack where engaged in making weapons.\n\nThe death toll rose to 415 that morning, as reported by the Associated Press. The Palestinian interior ministry in Gaza building was hit by Israeli missiles at dawn. The university and the ministry are both located in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood.\n\nA mosque in the Jabaliya refugee camp was also bombed by the IAF. The building was destroyed and five young girls whose house neighboured the mosque were killed. Ziad Abu-Tir, a senior member of the Islamic Jihad's military wing was killed in a strike in the Khan Younis area.\n\nThe International Red Cross reported that hospitals in the Gaza Strip were overwhelmed and unable to cope with the casualties. Red Cross spokesman in Gaza Iyad Nasr said Gaza needed more supplies to be brought in urgently, \"in particular the hospitals have been depleted and stretched to the maximum because of the closure imposed\". According to the IDF, Israel permitted a number of Turkish-donated ambulances from the West Bank to be transported to the Gaza Strip, as well as Red Cross, UNRWA, World Food Programme and Doctors Without Borders medical supplies.\n\nThe Israeli city of Ashkelon was hit by a Grad rocket, killing an Israeli-Arab construction worker and seriously wounding three other people. Nahal Oz army base in Southern Israel was hit by mortar fire, killing one soldier, who was later identified as Lutfi Nasraldin. The attacks increased pressure on the government as the army amassed infantry and armored forces along the border.\n\nIsrael's military intelligence chief said that Hamas' ability to fire rockets had been reduced by 50 percent, but that Hamas continued to command \"some 20,000 fighters\".\n\nThe foreign ministry of Senegal reported that exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal was ready to sign an immediate ceasefire with Israel, provided Israel lifted its blockade on the Gaza Strip.\n\nOn 29 December an IDF spokesperson confirmed for the first time that, apart from maintaining the naval blockade on Gaza, the Israeli Navy was taking an active part in the operation. A video taken by the Israeli Navy and published on several news sites showed the Israeli Navy attacking the Gaza coast line, using both Typhoon Weapon System and surface-to-surface missiles.\n\nAccording to Haaretz, among the targets hit by the Israeli Navy were Ismayil Haniah's offices, several command and control centers used by Hamas, and a Hamas patrol boat. On 31 December, the Israeli Navy \"targeted a number of Hamas outposts and rocket launching sites\", according to the IDF spokesperson. On 4 January, Israel extended the naval blockade from to prevent all vessels from entering the Strip.\n\nOn 29 December 2008, the Free Gaza Movement motor yacht \"Dignity\" set course from Cyprus, carrying aid to Gaza. The boat, which carried Irish human rights activist Caoimhe Butterly, former United States Representative and 2008 Green Party nominee for U.S. President Cynthia McKinney, journalists from Al Jazeera and CNN such as Karl Penhaul, and three surgeons including Dr. Elena Theoharous, a member of the Cyprus Parliament, attempted to enter the Gaza Strip, carrying of medical supplies. Its passengers stated that several Israeli naval vessels approached their boat. Free Gaza member David Halpin said that Israeli officers on board asked the captain to halt the \"Dignity\"'s course to Gaza, but he refused. According to CNN reporter Penhaul an Israeli vessel rammed the motor yacht, causing heavy damage. Penhaul has admittedly stated he did not have a view of the Israeli vessel at the time. Other passengers said that several Israeli vessels fired machine guns into the water. The activists stated that their boat was clearly in international waters, about \"70-80 miles\" or \"90 miles\" from the Gaza Strip coast. McKinney said that the Israeli vessel had rammed the boat \"approximately three times, twice in the front and once in the side\".\n\nIsraeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said that no shooting had occurred, and that the motor yacht was inside Israeli territorial waters, and that the boat had failed to respond to Israeli naval radio contact. Palmor said that the \"Dignity\" had crashed into an Israel vessel while attempting to outmanoeuvre it. Palmor also said that the fact that the ship was carrying journalists, including a CNN crew that had already broadcast live three times, proved that the incident was a provocation on the part of the media. Immediately after the incident, the boat turned back. Palmor stated that the naval ship offered to assist the passengers but that they had declined the offer. Palmor also stated that Israeli ships escorted the damaged boat to Cypriot territorial waters. It did not have enough fuel to return to Cyprus and ended up docking in Lebanon, where it was greeted with cheering crowds.\n\nCypriot Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou stated that Cyprus would lodge a formal complaint regarding the incident. In a written statement, the Consulate General of Israel to the Southeast USA, based in Atlanta, Georgia, said that McKinney \"has taken it upon herself to commit an act of provocation\", endangering herself and the crew, and called her behavior \"irresponsible\".\n\nIsraeli air-strikes struck five ministerial buildings, another structure owned by Islamic University, a sports center, two Hamas training camps, the home of a senior Hamas commander (who was not present), and offices of the Popular Resistance Committees. 10 fatalities were reported. The \"whole compound\" of ministerial buildings in Gaza City, including the Ministries of Finance, Interior and Education, were \"completely destroyed\" by 30 December. The International Middle East Media Center stated that the ministries were \"not 'terrorist' or military sites\" and that the buildings were \"civilian buildings that served the population in civil matters\". The premises of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP) were destroyed.\n\nGazans said that most Israeli strikes came without warning, but Israeli forces said in reply that they offered general warnings by dropping leaflets and by interrupting radio broadcasts telling Gaza residents to flee their homes if they were hiding weapons or terrorists. Amnesty International argued that \"there are no 'safe' places in Gaza for civilians to seek shelter\".\n\nIsrael kept schools closed within a radius of about from the Gaza border, citing concerns about further rocket fire. Residents were told to remain indoors and on the alert for alarms heralding incoming rockets. Hamas launched Chinese-made rockets at Beersheba, a city in southern Israel. A Grad missile landed in an empty kindergarten, causing damage. 24 Qassam rockets and 11 mortars were fired into Israel, causing some damage but no injuries.\n\nEgypt said it would only fully open its border with the Gaza Strip if the crossing post were to come under the control of Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Authority.\n\nIsrael had banned reporters from entering the Gaza strip since November 2008, citing security reasons. A petition made by 400 foreign journalists to enter the Gaza Strip was filed with Israel's supreme court.\n\nIsrael permitted 100 trucks carrying humanitarian supplies to enter the Gaza Strip via the Kerem Shalom border crossing. Five ambulances donated by Turkey were also allowed entry.\n\nAbout 35 Hamas fighters and five Palestinians civilians were killed during continued air strikes, as UNRWA reported that at least 25 percent of the dead thus far in the conflict had been civilians. Israel continued bombing, striking \"dozens of targets\" including smuggling tunnels along the Gaza–Egypt border.\n\nDuring the morning, two more rockets launched from Gaza hit the city of Beersheba; one of the rockets hit a school, causing severe damage to the building, but no casualties, as Israeli authorities instructed schools to remain closed. Two rockets landed in the Israeli city of Ashkelon, causing light injuries to two people; another rocket hit the town of Ofakim; several more landed around these cities and the cities of Kiryat Gat, Kiryat Malachi and Ashdod. Altogether, more than 60 Katyusha and Qassam rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel.\n\nAccording to UN humanitarian coordinator Max Gaylard, Gaza's hospitals were facing severe strain dealing with \"their largest ever trauma caseloads under some of the most adverse conditions imaginable\". Douglas Alexander, Britain's International Development Secretary is quoted saying \"Thousands are suffering. Medical items are in short supply. Fuel shortages have led to power cuts which in turn are affecting hospitals and other essential services. And UN stocks of food are very low. The limited aid that is getting through cannot be distributed properly because of bombing from the air and rocket attacks launched from inside Gaza\". A seriously injured six-year-old Palestinian boy was allowed to be transferred from Gaza to an Israeli children's hospital for treatment.\n\nIsrael rejected international appeals proposed by the French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner to grant a 48-hour cease-fire, saying that conditions were not right for the ceasefire. Meanwhile, Hamas spokesman Ayman Taha told the AFP agency that Hamas is open to any ceasefire proposition that will end the Israeli airstrikes and stop the Gaza blockade. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, threatened to halt peace talks if they go against the Palestinian interests and offer support for \"aggression\".\n\nIn a briefing to the Israeli cabinet, Shin Bet Chief Yuval Diskin said that Hamas has suffered significant damages and its rule over Gaza has been compromised, and that many Hamas operatives are hiding in hospitals, posing as medical staff, or hiding in mosques and using them as headquarters, since they assumed Israel won't attack them there. According to the Israeli air force, Hamas cells have been firing rockets from within densely populated areas and attempting to use Palestinian civilians as human shields. Cells have been detected in neighborhoods in Gaza City, Jabalya, Khan Younis and Rafah. The Israel Defense Forces has distributed flyers to the Palestinian population in Gaza, warning civilians not to stay close to any Hamas related buildings, for their own safety. The Israeli Air Force bombed a Gaza Strip mosque. According to the IDF the mosque was used by Hamas as a storage site for missiles and explosive materials and that rocket cells were firing at Israel from the mosque area and from nearby sites. According to ynet, the attack on the mosque was carried out after legal consultation with IDF experts on international law.\n\nIsrael's supreme court, in response to a court petition heard the previous day, \"gave the Israeli government until 10 a.m. Thursday to allow a small group of reporters into the Gaza Strip. The court warned that the reporters would be in the embattled area at their own risk\". The ruling \"went against a government decision six weeks ago to keep foreign reporters out of Gaza until rockets fired against Israel were halted\".\n\nNinety-three trucks carrying medicine, medical supplies and food donated by Jordan and international organisations were allowed entry to the Gaza Strip, through the Kerem Shalom border crossing. The World Food Programme notified the IDF that it was not in need of any further food shipments, as its warehouses were filled to capacity.\n\nTop UN aid officials urged Israel to allow for the resumption of fuel deliveries into the Gaza Strip, noting that the fuel shortage resulting from the suspension of deliveries had caused the main power plant in Gaza to shut down on 30 December, affecting 350,000 people in Central and Northern Gaza, who live with 16 hours or more of powercuts per day.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council met for two hours to hear statements from the Secretary General, the representatives of Palestine, Israel and the other members of the Council.\n\nIsraeli air strikes hit Gaza's parliament building, and the offices of the education and justice ministries, leaving four dead and 25 wounded. A pre-dawn strike against the home of a Hamas operative resulted in the death of a Palestinian woman. Palestinian reports also mention missiles landed on a workshop and several money changers' offices, one of which was close to a children's hospital, slightly damaging it. In Rafah, air strikes destroyed five smuggling tunnels and a police command center, while in Gaza City, an alleged weapons manufacturing center and storage facility was destroyed. Dozens of Israelis received text messages from Hamas in the morning warning that the offensive on Gaza would only bring about massive rocket fire on Israel. According to Israeli military sources, Hamas launched more than 50 rockets into Israel without causing casualties. Rockets hit Beersheba and Ashdod, damaging a residential building in the latter city.\n\nOn 1 January, more than 30 rockets were fired from Gaza into Southern Israel. One of them hit Ashdod, and two hit Beersheba. On 2 January, Hamas fired more than 20 rockets into Israel, some of them hitting Ashkelon, with 20 more rockets being fired the next day.\n\nAn Israeli warplane dropped a one-ton bomb on the home of Nizar Rayan, a senior Hamas political leader, in the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing him, 9 women (including his four wives), his 11 children, and wounding another 30. As a liaison between the political and armed wings of Hamas and advocate of renewing suicide bombings, Rayan is the most senior political figure to be killed by Israel since 2004. According to the IDF, Rayan's house was used as an arms cache, a communications headquarters and concealed a tunnel's opening. The \"International Herald Tribune\" reported that among those killed were Rayan's four wives and nine of their twelve children. On 2 January, the \"Times Online\" reports instead that two of his four wives and four of his 12 children were killed. UN OCHA reports that 13 of his family members, including 11 of his children, were killed and 12 were injured. There were reports that the family was warned by the IDF to leave the building but that they had refused to do so. According to ynet, recent deliberations by the IDF resulted in a decision that striking homes used as weapons storages when sufficient warning is given to the residents falls within the boundaries of international law and is legitimate. Rayan had sent his son to carry out a suicide attack in the community of Elei Sinai in 2001 in which two Israelis were killed, and was behind the bombing in the Ashdod Port in 2004 which left 10 Israelis dead.\n\nNinety trucks carrying food and medical supplies provided by international organisations entered the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom border crossing. Egypt blocked the entry of humanitarian aid from Qatar to pass through the Rafah crossing, however, Israel announced it would allow several aircraft from Qatar to land in Israel and the aid will be sent by truck to Gaza.\n\nHamas called for a \"Day of Wrath\" against Israel, bringing thousands of protesters out onto the streets of Gaza and the West Bank. Israeli air strikes on Friday targeted the homes of 20 Hamas officials, including that of Imad Akel in Nuseirat and Mohammed Madhoun. One of the strikes in Khan Yunis killed five civilians. Israel began to bomb the ground near its boundary in an attempt to clear it of landmines, increasing speculation that a ground offensive was imminent. Israel briefly opened the Erez crossing to allow about 440 residents with foreign passports to leave the Gaza Strip. Foreign journalists continued to be barred entry to Gaza; those who had lined up at the Erez crossing intending to enter after a court decision supported their right to do so when the crossing is open, were turned back by Israeli authorities. At around 10:45, in a repeat attack south-west of Deir al-Balah, an International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement ambulance, which had arrived to transport survivors following an initial attack, was destroyed by a second Israeli attack. The two crew members in the ambulance were injured and hospitalised.\n\nThroughout the day, thirty rockets were fired at Israel; three people were lightly injured, and several buildings sustained heavy damage. In Jerusalem, men under the age of 50, or those who didn't hold Israeli ID were unable to access prayers in the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nThrough 3 January 2009, Israel Air Force had flown 555 fighter sorties and 125 helicopter missions. Hundreds of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight hours were logged. They claimed to have destroyed more than 500 targets including one-third of the underground passages built by Hamas and other militant groups to smuggle and store rockets, weaponry, and other supplies. Throughout the initial stages of the air operation, the IDF transmitted messages to civilians in Gaza to stay away from Kassam launch sites and Hamas buildings and infrastructure.\n\nThirteen Palestinians, including six children, were killed and dozens wounded when the Israeli Air Force bombed the Maqadna Mosque in Beit Lahiya, in which about 200 people had gathered for evening prayers. Witnesses said over 200 Palestinians were praying inside at the time. Another person was killed as the American International School in Gaza was destroyed.\n\nA senior commander of Hamas' armed wing, Abu Zakaria al-Jamal was killed. He was commander of Gaza City's rocket-launching squads. In another air strike, Jamal Mamduch, commander of the Gaza City battalion, was killed. Many of the killed Hamas leaders died along with their families in their own homes.\n\nAt least 34 rockets were fired at Israel during the day, damaging several buildings, and lightly injuring one woman in Netivot. A number of Hamas rockets hit the city of Beersheba (population 186,000) in southern Israel, with one exploding on an empty school. Four Israelis had been killed by rockets fired from Gaza since the beginning of IAF attacks.\n\nIsrael launched its first artillery strikes. Israel had at this point carried out more than 700 strikes on Gaza since launching the offensive a week prior, according to AFP.\n\nThe UN warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis, and reported that at least 100 of the more than 400 Palestinians killed by Israel at this point were women and children.\n\nOn the evening of 3 January, Israeli ground troops entered Gaza.\nThe intention of the ground invasion, according to the Israeli Defense Forces website, was to secure areas within the Gaza Strip from which rockets had been launched after previous Israeli operations.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council held another closed-door meeting which failed to produce an official statement or an on-the-record debate or vote on a resolution. Speaking outside the meeting, the President of the General Assembly Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann said \"Once again, the world is watching in dismay the dysfunctionality of the Security Council.\"\n\nIsraeli ground troops entered Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza in the early hours. Israeli forces bisected Gaza and surrounded Gaza City, but reportedly restricted their movements to areas that were not heavily urbanised. The Israeli military said forty sites had been targeted, including targets for weapons depots and rocket launch sites. Despite a Supreme Court ruling to allow a limited number of journalists into the warzone, Israel refused to allow journalists into the area. Heavy fighting was reported near Gaza City. The IDF reported that 30 of its soldiers were wounded, 28 from a single mortar shell which landed next to a Golani regiment, with two out of those 30 badly injured. One later died of his wounds. Israel claimed that at least 50 Hamas fighters were killed in the incursion and dozens more were wounded. The Israeli soldier killed was identified as 22-year-old Sergeant Dvir Emanuelof. Palestinian medical sources said that at least 21 Palestinians were killed in the fighting. Additionally, Palestinian health ministry officials stated that at least 17 people were killed and 130 injured when Israeli shells fell near a school and the main market in Gaza City. A tank shell fired in northern Gaza killed 12 people, apparently including civilians. An Israeli missile hit a house in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood, killing a mother and her four children. In the morning, an ambulance operating out of Al-Awda hospital in the northern city of Beit Lahiya was shelled, seriously injuring 4 medical staff. At least 41 rockets and mortars were fired into Israel. Three Israeli civilians were lightly wounded.\n\nThree senior Hamas leaders were killed on Sunday: Hussam Hamdan, who according to the IDF was responsible for the organisation's rocket fire and the man behind the firing of Grad missiles towards the cities of Beersheba and Ofakim; Muhammad Hilou, who according to the IDF was responsible for Hamas' special forces in Khan Younis and for the firing of long-range rockets; and Mohammed Shalpokh, who commanded Hamas forces in Rafah.\n\nAlso on 4 January, the director of Israel's internal security agency, the Shin Bet, told the cabinet that Hamas leaders both at home and in exile felt that their organisation was facing an \"existential threat\" and was \"willing to reach an agreement\" on a ceasefire. However, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said that Israel did not intend to conclude a \"diplomatic product\" with Hamas. Such a move had been avoided in the past out of fear of legitimising Hamas as a negotiating partner.\n\nHamas sources told \"The Jerusalem Post\" that members of al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, the Popular Resistance Committees, Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine were participating in the fighting against the IDF, and that they were making use of U.S. and Israeli weapons confiscated from members of Fatah in the 2007 Battle of Gaza.\n\nAccording to medical sources, the total Palestinian death toll for the day was 42, most of them civilians.\n\nFatah officials in Ramallah told The Jerusalem Post that Hamas militiamen had been assaulting many Fatah activists since the beginning of the operation last Saturday. They said at least 75 activists were shot in the legs while others had their hands broken. Meanwhile, sources close to Hamas revealed over the weekend that the movement had \"executed\" more than 35 Palestinians who were suspected of collaborating with Israel and were being held in various Hamas security installations.\n\nThe New York Times reported that Israelis fired tank shells into a house in the Tuffah district, and that early on the 4th, in the crowded Shati refugee camp near the coast, a shell fired from a navy ship hit another house; there were no survivors.\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that in the Zeitoun district, early in the morning of 4 January, Israeli troops evacuated about 110 members of the Samouni, an extended family clan, into a Samouni-owned warehouse, where they waited without running water or food for 24 hours. Starting at 6:35am on the 5th, the house was repeatedly shelled. Some were killed inside the building by falling masonry; although the rest attempted to flee the building, the majority of the dead were killed outside, by shrapnel. Initial reports were of 60 to 70 killed; the UN count of the total killed was 30, with 11 Samouni family members dead. A few survivors, some wounded, others carrying some of the dead or dying, managed to reach Gaza's main north-south road where passing cars stopped to take them to the hospital. A Red Crescent volunteer said that injured people were left behind: \"we could not get to them and it was no longer safe for us to stay.\"\n\nAccording to the Red Cross, ambulances were not given permission to enter the neighborhood to retrieve the injured from the building until a day later. The United Nations confirmed these reports on 9 January Three children later died after they were transported to hospital. Reports of the incident were given to the media by Norwegian doctors stationed in the Shifa Hospital, Gaza, as early as Tuesday, 5 January.\n\nB'Tselem, an Israeli human rights group, alleged that Israeli forces had not done their duty to prevent civilian casualties by assisting the wounded. 48 hours after the attack, ICRC ambulances searching 100 yards from where Israeli soldiers were stationed found four children, too weak to move, that had taken refuge near corpses believed to be those of their family. \"The ICRC believes that in this instance the Israeli military failed to meet its obligation under international humanitarian law to care for and evacuate the wounded,\" said a statement from the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, and called the delay considers the delay in granting access \"unacceptable\".\n\nOther buildings were reported as being shelled during the incident, and IDF infantry reportedly fired on an occupied house The survivors of the incident were treated at Shifa hospital, Gaza.\n\nThe IDF stated that it had no knowledge of the incident, and that \"IDF forces had not yet reached the areas in question\" by 4 January. An Israeli army spokesman said there was no record of a \"specific attack on a specific target\", nor had the army massed civilians in specific locations. \"This does not rule out exchanges of fire but it does rule out targeting of a specific building,\" he said. Israel said there is not a humanitarian crisis in Gaza and that it is working with international agencies and doing what it can to reduce civilian casualties.\n\nThe UN's OCHA said that if it was true it was \"one of the gravest incidents\" in the conflict, and called for an investigation into the incident, but did not make any \"accusations of deliberate action\" at the time. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navanethem Pillay, said the Zeitoun Samouni incident \"appears to have all the elements of war crimes.\" Pillay called for \"credible, independent and transparent\" investigations into possible violations of humanitarian law.\n\nAs Israeli tanks and troops seized control of large parts of the Gaza Strip, tens of thousands of Gazans fled their homes amidst artillery and gunfire, and flooded into the heart of Gaza City. Gun battles reportedly broke out between Israel and Hamas on the streets of Gaza, as Israeli forces surrounded the city. BBC reporters stated that the battles were preventing essential medical supplies from reaching hospitals and casualties.\n\nAn airstrike hit an ambulance, killing three paramedics. Israeli tank shelling killed at least 24 civilians in the Gaza Strip, 13 of them children. A family of seven were killed by an Israeli airstrike in al-Shati Camp east of Gaza City. In Gaza's Zaytun neighborhood, seven members of another family were killed and in separate incident, a pregnant Palestinian woman and her four children were killed.\n\nMedia reported that Israel was using the controversial substance white phosphorus over civilian targets during the course of its military operation. Some media reported that Israel used the substance as a smokescreen. Israel used white phosphorus in Lebanon in 2006, and the UK and the US have used it elsewhere. Israel denied using the substance. According to Ha'aretz and the UN humanitarian chief, Israel had also used cluster bombs.\n\nHamas said it would send a delegation to Egypt for talks, as France spearheaded diplomatic efforts to obtain a 48-hour truce. Israel continued to refuse to let journalists enter the Gaza Strip, despite a ruling from the Israeli Supreme Court to admit a limited number of reporters.\n\nOver 40 Qassam and Grad rockets were fired from Gaza at southern Israel striking Ashkelon, Ashdod, Sderot, Kiryat Malakhi, near Ofakim, Netivot and Beersheba. Hamas also fired rockets at the area between Ashdod and Gedera.\n\nHamas said they have killed 9 Israeli fighters. Hamas also said they have captured two Israeli soldiers. Israel dismissed the claims, accusing Hamas of engaging in \"psychological warfare\".\nBy evening, the Israeli Defense Forces said that during the course of the day they had killed between 80-100 Hamas fighters in ground fighting, and that a further 100 \"wanted gunmen\" had been taken prisoner. Palestinian cells fired nearly 40 rockets and mortar shells at Israel, injuring four Israelis.\n\nAn IDF spokesperson stated that three Israeli soldiers were killed in a friendly fire incident after erroneously identifying Israeli soldiers as \"terrorists.\" About 20 soldiers were injured in the incident. Another IDF officer was reported killed in a separate friendly fire incident.\n\nUN officials published a report which stated that an Israeli airstrike on the grounds of a UN school, which was serving as a makeshift refugee camp for hundreds of displaced Palestinians, killed three Palestinian men. An official from the Danish charitable organization DanChurchAid reported that three mobile clinics set up to help hospitals in Gaza cope with the wounded were bombarded in Israeli airstrikes, despite being clearly marked as humanitarian vehicles.\n\nA total of 30 Palestinian civilians were known to have been killed on 5 January, and the total Palestinian death toll at the end of the day was 540, until details of the Samouni family incident (below) emerged several days later.\n\nAccording to Palestinian sources, 20 people were killed in a number of IDF attacks. Medical workers reported that an attack on Deir al-Balah and the Bureij refugee camp killed ten Palestinians, including a father and his three children. An IDF soldier was killed and four wounded in an ambush in northern Gaza City. The IDF soldiers returned fire, killing all of the Hamas fighters. The IDF soldier killed was identified as Alexander Mashevitzky. According to YNET, the head of Hamas' artillery forces and a senior member of Hamas' military wing, Ayman Siam, were both hit and believed to have been killed in an aerial attack in the Jabaliya neighborhood in the northern Gaza Strip.\n\nAt least 30 rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza. Gedera, south of Tel Aviv, was hit for the first time. A Grad rocket landed near a house, lightly injuring a 3-month old girl.\n\n\"There's nowhere safe in Gaza\", said John Ging, the UN's senior official in Gaza. \"Everyone is terrorized and traumatized.\" He spoke of 1 million Palestinians without electricity and 700,000 without water, challenging world leaders to undergo similar privations until they had stopped the fighting: \"You are not to sleep, eat or drink until you stop the killing of innocent people in the Gaza Strip\".\n\nIsrael continued to refuse foreign journalists' access to the Gaza Strip. The continuing ban on foreign media access drew criticism from journalists that Israel was trying to \"manage\" the story. Israel said that opening border crossings for journalists would endanger staff at the terminals. While the Associated Press and some other news organizations have Palestinian reporters, photographers and cameramen based in Gaza, many media outlets have no reliable source of independent information.\n\nMedics report that an Israeli airstrike on a 4-story building in Gaza City the night before had killed 12 members of the same extended family; the bodies of 7 children aged one to twelve years old, 3 women and 2 men from the Daya family were pulled from the rubble on Tuesday.\n\nSenior Israeli defense officials said that Hamas had set up independent hospitals, and had stolen Israeli aid supplies.\n\nA senior IDF officer said that \"tunnels, weapons, anti-aircraft missiles, grenades, explosive devices, and weapons prepared for future attacks, such as motorbikes intended for kidnapping,\" had been found; the officer also stated that booby-trapped homes had been encountered, and that a booby-trapped mosque had been blown up.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council held a four-hour meeting in New York attended by Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority, the UN Secretary-General, David Miliband (foreign secretary of the United Kingdom), and Condoleezza Rice (US Secretary of State), where all sides stated their view of the situation.\n\nPalestinian medics in Gaza stated, and news agencies worldwide reported, that 43 people were killed in an Israeli strike on an UNRWA school. The UN clarified in February that the shells had struck outside the school, not within the compound. Maxwell Gaylord (the UN humanitarian coordinator in Jerusalem) said that the UN \"would like to clarify that the shelling and all of the fatalities took place outside and not inside the school.\" John Ging, UNRWA's operations director in Gaza stated he had been misquoted by the Jerusalem Post and other newspapers as saying that shells had hit the school, and that the UNRWA's earliest report on 6 January was correct in saying that shells had hit outside it.\n\nTwo tank shells exploded outside the school, spraying shrapnel on people inside and outside the building, where at least 350 Palestinians had sought refuge from fighting between Israelis and Palestinians. The strike took place near the Al-Fakhura school in Jabaliya in northern Gaza and was the third deadly Israeli attack near United Nations-run schools on 6 January.\n\nThe IDF said mortars from inside the school were fired at Israeli forces, and that Israeli soldiers were responding to them. The IDF also stated that bodies of militants were found inside the school afterwards. Time magazine reported, \"The IDF gave the names of two Hamas combatants it says were killed inside the school — Imad and Hassan Abu Askar — who allegedly fired the mortars. But the IDF did not explain how it was able to identify them among the many casualties. Troops did not visit the school after the attack, nor did the IDF have access to a casualty list from Gaza's hospitals.\". Nevertheless, Col. Moshe Levi (head of the IDF's Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration) said, in February 2009, that 12 were the Palestinians killed in the incident - nine Hamas operatives and three noncombatants. Hamas rejected the claims of any fire from the school, calling them \"baseless\".\n\nUNRWA spokesperson Christopher Gunness stated that the IDF later admitted in closed-door meetings that the fire they responded to was from outside the school. He noted that the UN buildings that had been fired upon displayed the UN flag, and that the UN had provided GPS coordinates of UN schools sheltering civilians to the IDF. Days earlier Gunness had said that the UNRWA was \"99.9% certain\" that there were no terrorists or military activity in the school, adding that this \"does not necessarily contradict Israel's claim that the militants were operating close by\".\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was said by an aide to be investigating the option of bringing the incident before international courts.\n\nThe day of the attack, the UN requested an inquiry into both the assault and the Israeli allegations about terrorists firing from its schools. Ban Ki Moon condemned the attack, saying it was \"totally unacceptable.\"\n\nAt least 12 Palestinians were killed in fresh strikes in the Gaza Strip. At least 15 rockets hit Israel, causing no casualties.\n\nFollowing the strikes, Israel initiated a three-hour \"humanitarian\" truce. The Israeli army refrained from attacks from 1 to 4 pm, though there were reports of exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Hamas during that period. During the temporary truce, 80 aid trucks were allowed to enter the Strip, some of which delivered industrial fuel to Gaza's power plant. Access was granted to previously closed regions, to allow residents access to supplies. According to Israeli sources, they planned to repeat this move daily. Fighting resumed immediately following the end of the truce.\n\nDespite the parties’ agreement to halt fighting during aid deliveries, a UN convoy was fired upon, killing an aid worker and wounding two others. Israeli tank fire was mentioned as the cause of the incident, but the IDF denied responsibility. Soldiers contended that Hamas snipers had targeted the aid workers. An Israeli medic said the wounded were saved by the Israelis, while the Palestinian Red Crescent Society denied it and said it had evacuated the victims. The Jerusalem Post wrote that the two wounded Palestinians had gunshot wounds and probably were hit by Hamas gunfire. While the UNRWA director acknowledged he could not be absolutely certain that the attacks came from IDF forces, an UNRWA spokesman blamed the Israelis for sending mixed contradicting messages As a result of the incident, the UN briefly suspended aid shipments but resumed them on 9 January after receiving assurances from Israel that they were not being targeted.\n\nAt least two dozen Israeli airstrikes were reported, in which at least 4 Palestinians were killed and at least 22 wounded. UN officials said at least one driver in a UN aid convoy was killed after the convoy was fired upon by Israeli forces. The UN said the attack happened in spite of co-ordinating its movements with the IDF. It subsequently said it would suspend all relief activities in Gaza until it had received guarantees of the safety of its staff from Israel.\n\nIsrael announced the deaths of three soldiers: Roi Rosner, Amit Robinson, and Omer Rabinovitch, bringing the total number of soldiers killed to eight. Israel also claimed that many Hamas fighters were killed.\n\nThree Katyusha rockets from Lebanon territory were fired at the northern Israeli city of Nahariyya. Two civilians were injured. The IDF returned fire at the launch sites in southern Lebanon. No one claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council met and passed a resolution \"stressing the urgency of and calls for an immediate, durable and fully respected ceasefire, leading to the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza\", and welcoming the Egyptian initiative, among other points. While the United States abstained on the vote, Condoleezza Rice explained to the Council that the U.S. thought it important to see the outcomes of the Egyptian mediation efforts in order to see what the resolution might have been supporting, but that \"after a great deal of consideration, we decided that the resolution -- the text of which we support, the goals of which we support and the objectives of which we fully support -- should indeed be allowed to go forward.\"\n\nThe order to abstain on the resolution, which U.S. diplomats had helped to draft, reportedly came at the last minute from President Bush, following pressure from the Israeli government, who issued a statement that the resolution was \"not practical\". In an unusually public rebuke, the Israeli Prime Minister boasted of how he had phoned up President Bush while Bush was in the middle of a speech, and how the incident left Rice \"pretty embarrassed\".\n\nThe Israeli offensive continued, despite the passing of a UN Security resolution calling for an immediate and durable ceasefire.\n\nIsrael dismissed the Security Council resolution as \"impractical\": Ehud Olmert's office said that more Hamas rockets \"only prove that the U.N.'s decision is not practical and will not be kept in practice by the Palestinian murder organizations.\"\n\nHamas objected to not being consulted during the drafting of the resolution: \"Nobody consulted Hamas or talked to Hamas. Nobody put Hamas in the picture and yet Hamas is required to accept it. This is unacceptable,\" Mohammed Nazzal, a senior Hamas official based in Syria, told Al-Arabiya television.\n\nAt least 30 rockets were fired at southern Israel. Hamas claimed to have hit the Tel Nof airbase, some from Tel Aviv, which, if true, would make it the farthest strike to date. Hamas also announced that Mahmoud Abbas' term as President had expired, and that while they do not expect Abbas to step down while the war continues in Gaza, they no longer recognize his legitimacy. Abbas responded that he still had another year, citing a law that says presidential and parliamentary elections should be held at the same time.\n\nCondoleezza Rice said that it was \"difficult\" to protect civilians in a place as densely populated as Gaza — an area long and roughly six miles wide. A UN report on Gaza noted that \"the borders are closed, making this one of the rare conflicts where civilians have no place to flee.\"\n\nA three-hour truce took place on 9 January. Palestinians fired three Grad-type rockets at Ashdod, shortly after 1 pm, the truce's start-time. While supplies were being transferred through Kerem Shalom border crossing, Palestinians fired several mortar shells at the terminal. No casualties were reported.\n\nThe UN said its aid workers would resume movement, having received assurances from Israel that they were not being targeted.\n\nAt around 23:00, an Israeli drone destroyed a Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) car that was clearly marked with the NPA logo, outside the home of an NPA employee, Mahmoud Hamada, at al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza. Nobody was injured. Surrounding buildings were severely damaged. The Secretary-General of NPA, Petter Eide, said that there are no military targets in the area. Raymond Johansen of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the incident was a \"clear violation of international law.\"\n\nNo rockets were fired into Israel overnight, a sharp drop from the dozens of projectiles that were launched in the early days of the offensive; during the morning, three rockets struck the southern city of Ashkelon, lightly wounding two people. Six additional rockets landed in open areas, with no casualties.\n\nThe Israeli military said that in Gaza it had killed more than 15 terrorists and that IDF aircraft had attacked more than 40 targets throughout Gaza striking ten rocket-launching sites, weapons-storage facilities, smuggling tunnels, an anti-aircraft missile launcher and gunmen. Although Palestinian hospital officials could confirm only four deaths they also stated that fighting has hindered paramedics from collecting bodies and treating the wounded. Palestinian medical officials said that eight people were killed by Israeli tank fire Saturday in the town of Jebailiya and the dead appeared to be civilians per paramedics on the scene.\n\nThe Israeli military said it would halt the fire in Gaza for three hours on Saturday to allow the territory's besieged residents to leave their homes and stock up on supplies. Medics use the lull to rescue casualties in areas of fighting, and aid groups also rush through food distribution.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority president urged both Israel and Hamas to agree to an Egypt-brokered truce Saturday, but he singled out Israel, saying it would be responsible for a \"waterfall of blood\" if it didn't accept the deal.\n\nOn 10 January the IDF stated that Hamas fighters are suffering from exhaustion. An IDF military commander said that Hamas militants are beginning to desert battle and refuse orders. Israeli military claims that Hamas younger operatives refused to venture outside to lob mortars against Israeli forces, prompting a senior Hamas leader, Amir Mansi, to operate the mortar himself. After IDF soldiers identified the source of fire, they shot and killed Mansi, wounding two others involved in the attack. Amir Mansi has been reported as an expert in the Grad rocket launching program, having been trained by Hezbollah. Also, the IDF stated that more than 300 Hamas fighters have been killed so far in the operation, the highest estimate so far, and at least 120 have been captured. According to the reports, entire Hamas companies have been eliminated by the Israeli forces. A senior Israeli officer said that \"complete battalions that have just been erased\", adding that Hamas fighters are afraid to come out to fight, with many going AWOL and abandoning the battlefield.\n\nThe IAF attacked overnight a mosque in the town of Rafah, which according to Israel was being used as a Hamas training camp, a meeting place and a weapons cache. The IDF reported that the mosque contained machine-guns and anti-aircraft missiles.\n\nIsraeli and Palestinian officials report that at least 40 Hamas gunmen were killed in a battle with IDF soldiers in the Gaza City neighborhood of Sheikh Ajalin. According to reports, Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists ambushed IDF forces in Sheikh Ajalin, which led to \"some of the heaviest fighting\" since phase two of the operation began. Palestinians reported that four people had been killed in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. The IDF reported hitting dozens of gunmen across the Gaza Strip on 10 January and 11. Additionally, the IAF reported that Hamas operatives have tried to shoot down an IAF fixed wing aircraft with anti-aircraft missiles for the first time since operation in Gaza begun.\n\nTwo rockets landed in the city of Beersheba, a half an hour before the city's high schools were to reopen after being closed for more than 10 days. Some 65% of Beersheba's 11 and 12th graders (about 2.700 students) were to return to school and study in bomb shelters.\n\nTwo terrorists and a woman were killed by Israeli strikes in the southern Gaza Strip. Dozens were injured in attacks near the village of Khouza to the east of Khan Younis. Palestinian medics in the area said that the injured suffered from burns and gas inhalations, symptoms indicating exposure to white phosphorus. Israel rejected the claim.\n\nThere have been rumors circulating in the Egyptian media that IAF strikes have wounded the captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. A spokesman of Hamas politburo, Moussa Abu Marzuk, said that Shalit's condition is no longer a concern for Hamas. An Israeli Defense Ministry official dismissed the comments as \"psychological warfare\". Vice Premier Haim Ramon in an interview with Army Radio added that Hamas is using Shalit as a \"bargaining chip\" hoping for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the captured soldier.\n\nOn 11 January, the IDF started to deploy thousands of reservists into the Gaza Strip for the first time since Israeli offensive against Hamas begun 16 days ago. The Israeli government announced that it had approved tens of thousands of call-ups of its reserve forces before the ground operation started on 3 January. The troops have been refreshing on their urban training since then, and the bulk of the fighting has been done by Golani and Givati brigades. Analysts comment that this suggests Israel is intensifying its military efforts against Hamas.\n\nAn Israeli patrol came under fire on the Syrian border on Sunday. The soldiers did not return fire and no casualties were reported, although the vehicle they were traveling in sustained damage. The IDF assessed that the Syrian army was not involved, believing it was Palestinians protesting the Gaza operation. It was the second cross-border attack in three days after three Katyusha rockets were fired into northern Israel on 8 January from Lebanon. Israel filed a complaint to the UNDOF in Syria which sent a team to investigate the reports.\n\nThe IDF reported that it had uncovered an explosive device rigged with a timer that was hidden in a Palestinian school. A fuse attached to the explosives extended to a zoo located dozens of yards away. The soldiers managed to neutralize the bomb before it went off. According to the IDF, numerous weapons, including RPG launchers, grenades and AK-47 assault rifles were found inside the school.\n\nIn the afternoon, during the \"humanitarian corridor\" - a time in which the Israeli army holds it fire and allows civilians in Gaza to receive aid - Hamas terrorists fired several rocket barrages. A rocket fired from the northern Gaza Strip hit a wall surrounding a kindergarten in Ashdod. There were no reports of damage or injury, but a few people were treated for shock. Other rockets were fired at Ashkelon, Sderot, Kiryat Malachi, and Eshkol Regional Council.\n\nOn 12 January, four Israeli paratroopers were wounded in northern Gaza. A unit of Israeli paratroopers also discovered a Hamas tunnel, and shot and killed a female would-be suicide bomber. Israeli ground troops and aircraft targeted over 25 Hamas sites, including tunnels and weapons caches, killing four Hamas fighters and five civilians. Israeli forces continued their advance, with reports of fierce fighting around Gaza City. Airstrikes continued across the strip.\n\nOn 12 January, the IDF reported that it had started deploying reserve forces in Gaza.\n\nThe IDF reported on 12 January that four soldiers were wounded, one seriously. The troops were part of a paratrooper unit that was operating in northern Gaza. The military said they launched an inquiry whether this incident was caused by friendly fire. According to previous reports friendly fire has so far killed four soldiers in separate incidents on 5 January. Hamas' armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigade, claimed to have destroyed two Israeli tanks in the Gaza City neighborhood of Zeitun, and that they killed many soldiers in the town of Khuz'a, near the Israeli border. The Israeli army refuted these claims.\nAnother paratrooper unit discovered and eventually destroyed a tunnel in Gaza that, according to the IDF, was meant to transfer suicide bombers into Israel. The tunnel was found some 300 meters from the fence on the border with Israel. It was also reported that the soldiers shot and killed a female would-be suicide bomber. During the day the military, backed by the IAF, targeted over 25 sites on Monday, including tunnels and weapon caches, killing 9 Palestinians, five of whom, according to Palestinian officials, were civilians.\n\nUS President George W. Bush threw his support behind Israel once more on 12 January. The President was quoted with saying that he believes a sustainable ceasefire will only be achieved if Hamas stops firing rockets at Israel and that it is solely Hamas' choice to make. He reiterated Israel's right to defend herself but hoped she \"continued to be mindful of the innocent folk\" and help with humanitarian aid transfer into Gaza. Meanwhile, it was reported that Hamas raided over 100 trucks with humanitarian aid meant for civilians and sold it to the highest bidder. Israeli forces stopped several attempts to smuggle prohibited goods into Israel, namely electronics, since Defense Minister Ehud Barak said they do not classify as humanitarian aid. Israel still allows certain repair items to flow into Gaza to repair the damaged electric grid.\n\nIsrael is considering establishing a field hospital outside of the Gaza Strip to facilitate medical aid for Palestinians civilians wounded in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Under the plan, Israel is also considering bringing the facility inside the Palestinian territory to make it more accessible for the Palestinians seeking treatment. The hospital would be run by the IDF Medical Corps. Throughout the conflict, IDF has allowed the passage of over 900 trucks and facilitated with the transfer of over 20,000 tons of basic food and supplies.\n\nAs the Palestinian death toll exceeded 900, in a statement the IDF said it believes 400 of those are known Hamas fighters, adding that a \"significant number are also Hamas operatives\" in the remaining 500 dead.\n\nIsrael's land, sea and air bombardment continues for an 18th day, with shelling and air raids hitting Gaza City, Rafah and elsewhere. Israel's military says it hit 60 targets overnight.\nGround troops advance into the southern and eastern suburbs of Gaza City. The Israeli military says an officer and two soldiers are injured by an explosion in a booby-trapped house in the northern Gaza Strip.\n\nAn unidentified gunman opened fire at an Israeli Border Guard patrol from the Jordanian side of the border north of Eilat early Tuesday morning. The Border Guards returned fire. No one was injured in the incident, the first such shooting in more than a decade.\n\nIsrael's bombardment continues for a 19th day, with overnight air raids on 60 targets, including 35 weapons-smuggling tunnels on the border with Egypt and an unknown number of rocket-launching sites. One air strike damages a cemetery in Gaza City. Israel was targeted from the Lebanese border. Israeli troops counterattacked. No casualties were reported on either side. A message, allegedly by Osama Bin Laden, was released declaring Jihad on Israel.\n\nIsraeli tanks and troops advance deep into Gaza City after an intense bombardment in the early hours, sending hundreds of terrified civilians into the streets to try to flee the fighting.\nTonnes of aid go up in flames after Israeli artillery shells hit a UN compound. The Quds hospital is evacuated because of a fire caused by a tank shell.\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon meets Israeli leaders to push for a ceasefire. He says the death toll, put at 1,100 by Gaza medical officials, has reached an \"unbearable point\".\n\nTwo rockets fired by Gaza militants on Thursday hit Be'er Sheva, wounding five people, including a 7-year-old boy who was seriously hurt. One of the rockets landed directly on a car.\n\nIn a battle near Jebaliya, an IDF soldier was killed and another was severely wounded.\nThe IAF attacked over 15 sites, including rocket-launching sites and squads, gunmen, and a smuggling tunnel. The IDF also said that 40 Hamas operatives have been killed overnight.\n\nThree senior members of Hamas, Said Seyam, the Hamas interior minister and his brother Ayad Seyam and an unidentified person was killed in an IAF strike on Ayad Seyam's house. 20 other people were reportedly injured in the same strike. Palestinian sources said that the head of Islamist terrorist group's security apparatus, Salah Abu Shreh, and its military commander in Gaza City, Mahmoud Watfah, were also killed in the attack. Hamas, despite the truce proposal, vowed revenge for the assassination of Seyam, who was one of the masterminds of the 2007 coup against the ruling party, Fatah and was the number three most sought Hamas leader after Ismail Haniyeh and Mahmoud Zahar. Shin Bet security agency, the Israeli equivalent of the FBI, were responsible for the intelligence leading to the airstrike that killed Seyam.\n\nIt is reported by several people, journalist and doctors that the Israeli army fired upon the UNRWA compound, schools, ambulances, hospitals and media offices. In response to this, Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary general, has started a protest.\n\nThe bodies of 23 Palestinians were pulled from the rubble in the Tel al-Hawa district of Gaza City after Israeli tanks withdraw in the pre-dawn hours. Palestinian medics say at least 1,155 Palestinians have died over the past three weeks.\n\nPalestinian militants in the Gaza Strip on Friday, 16 January, fired over 15 rockets at southern Israel, leaving five Israelis wounded: a pregnant woman was hospitalized in Ashkelon after her home suffered a direct hit from a rocket; two were wounded in Ashdod - one moderately and the other lightly; earlier three Israelis sustained light wounds when two Grad rockets struck the southern town of Kiryat Gat; five rockets exploded in the Eshkol region in the morning.\n\nMore than 50 air strikes were carried out in Gaza overnight, ahead of the expected vote by Israel's cabinet on a proposal for a ceasefire. Heavy explosions echoed south of Gaza City.\n\nUnited Nations officials say two children, aged five and seven, were killed when Israeli tank fire hit a UN school where hundreds had taken shelter in the northern town of Beit Lahiya. A UN spokesman, Chris Gunness, said an investigation ought to be held \"to determine whether a war crime has been committed\". Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor rejected the call, saying: \"There's not the slightest piece of evidence to support such allegations.\"\n\nIsrael implemented a unilateral cease-fire early Sunday and in announcing the cease-fire late Saturday, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Israel had achieved its goals and more, stating that \"Hamas was hit hard, in its military arms and in its government institutions. Its leaders are in hiding and many of its men have been killed.\" According to Olmert's statement, the cease-fire went into effect at 2 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) with the IDF warning that attacks on soldiers or civilians \"will be met with a harsh response.\" If Hamas holds its fire, the military \"will weigh pulling out of Gaza at a time that befits us,\" Olmert said. If not, Israel \"will continue to act to defend our residents.\"\n\nThe first death after the cease-fire was a Palestinian farmer who was shot dead by Israeli soldier while checking his farm in Khan Younis, on 18 January morning. The Israeli army said they shot the farmer because he was approaching land occupied at that moment by Israeli ground troops.\n\nHamas fired ten rockets into Southern Israel, Israel responded with airstrikes.\n\nHamas made a televised announcement of a ceasefire issuing their own demands of Israeli withdrawal within a week, reopen Gaza border crossings, and provide aid.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Gaza gunmen fired at IDF patrols in two separate incidents near the Kissufim border crossing, in central Gaza, and in southern Gaza - IDF returned fire. No one was wounded and no significant damage was reported. Also, eight mortar shells were fired from the central Gaza Strip. Most shells apparently landed in Palestinian areas. IAF targeted and hit one of the mortar launchers. Shelling of mortars continued Tuesday night and 3-4 shells were fired at Eshkol Regional Council. No casualties were reported. On the same day, another Palestinian farmer was shot dead by the IDF while approaching his farm in Jabalia and two children were killed in an explosion of an Israeli bomb left behind in Gaza City.\n\nEarly in the day, Israel said it had completed its troop pull-out from Gaza.\n\nIn the wake of the conflict, Hamas accused rival Palestinian faction Fatah of spying for Israel. Fatah denied spying on Hamas for Israel, and party leaders said Thursday that at least 175 of their members had been rounded up and tortured in recent days.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56206672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56206672", "title": "True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil", "text": "True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil\n\nTrue History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil (German: \"Warhaftige Historia und beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen)\" is an account published by the German soldier Hans Staden in 1557 describing his two trips to the new world. The book is best known for Staden's descriptions of his experiences while held captive by the Tupinambá near Curitiba, Brazil. \"True History\" became one of the best-selling travel narratives of the sixteenth century.\n\nHans Staden arrived in Brazil as a gunner for the Portuguese in 1550 and was taken as a prisoner of war by the Tupinamabá people of Brazil. The Tupinamabá had a reputation of performing cannibalistic rituals, especially with prisoners of war. Since the Tupinamabá were French allies and the French and Portuguese were enemies, the account was a dramatic first person account from a Portuguese view of the Natives.\n\n\"True History: An Account of Cannibal Captivity in Brazil\" shares various observations Hans Staden, a German explorer, had on a tribal group in Brazil called Tupinambá. This travel log consists of two introductions, list of illustrations, and two parts, with fifty-three and thirty-six chapters. Throughout the book, Staden utilizes his illustrations to visually depict his observations. Furthermore, Staden introduces cannibalism as a cultural and religious practice to his readers alongside with his survival journey. Overall, he shares his personal views on the indigenous culture, tradition, and lifestyle from the perspective of a European captive.\n\nStaden’s experience begins with being captured by two Tupinambá males—Jeppipo Wasu and Alkindar Miri—and brought to a small village called Uwattibi [Ubatuba]. His initial response in encountering the indigenous people showed fear because they desired to eat his flesh. Religious rituals such as singing, dancing, and worshiping that insinuated cannibalistic intentions aggravated Staden’s emotional stress. Ipperu Wasu, who held Staden as a captive, bestowed Staden to Alkindar Miri in return of a favor. Staden believed his death would involve barbaric methods; however, he underwent a series of rites. The Tupinambá people decorated Staden with strings and rings, and further continued to dance as a form of ritual.\n\nThe Tupinambá distrusted the Portuguese, rather favored the French who established a diplomatic relation through trades. Unfortunately, the Tupinambá people categorized Staden as a Portuguese, which definitively put him an inevitable situation of death. Moreover, the two natives who captured Staden harbored hostility against the Portuguese who slain their father. Their vengefulness intensified Staden’s fate. Despite Staden’s attempt to convince the Tupinambá by lying about his nationality as French, a Frenchman disproved Staden’s words. Staden believed the Frenchman would support him based on their mutual religious background. Instead, the Frenchman advocated the Tupinambá and departed as soon as he had his load ready.\n\nAfter being imprisoned for several days, the Tupinambá transported Staden to another village called Arirab [Ariro] where he met their highest king, Konyan Bebe. During his temporary visit, Staden continued to persuade the king that he is not an enemy. He flattered the king by noting his fierce and belligerent personality, which the king regardlessly proceeded on questioning Staden’s nationality as well as sharing personal stories of how he slain the Portuguese. After being interrogated, the Tupinambá brought Staden back to Uwattibi. Staden expected his death on the arrival. However, the Tupiniquins attacked the village during which Staden volunteered to assist the Tupinambá in the combat. Despite his demonstration, Staden was placed under surveillance again.\n\nIn Part II, Staden shares his observations on the Tupinambá nature, culture, and lifestyle. His overall perception of South America emphasized the rich forest and mountains. He describes the indigenous people as savages who are naked, dark skinned, dexterous, and have facial paintings. For residential environment, he argues that the dwellings were architecturally well protected from enemies with resources such as food and wood located in close proximity within their huts. Staden notes the technology devised by the indigenous people. He suggests the natives create fire through using friction that later plays a crucial role in manufacturing cooking utensils such as pots. In regions with no European presence, the natives utilize animal tools to cut and hew, as they are unaware of axes, knives, and scissors. Similarly, European influence exists partially across the indigenous population. For example, Staden mentions few tribal groups that participated in trades with the Europeans consume salts, whereas those who did not eat no salt. Furthermore, Staden mentions boiling as an essential part in the culinary culture among the natives. In addition, the indigenous hunting techniques that involve using tools such as bows, arrows, and nets serve as a huge contributor to the food supply. Staden states “It seldom happens that a man returns empty-handed from hunting.” Moreover, although Staden notes the indigenous communities “do not have any particular form of government or law,” he takes account of chiefs as an integral political figure who tend to show competency in waging wars. Staden, therefore, argues social hierarchy exists in the indigenous societies.\n\nHans Staden was a German traveler born around 1520 in Hesse, a principality of what was then known as the “Holy Roman Empire.” Throughout his education, he studied in several towns throughout Hesse and even served as a soldier. It came as a surprise to all when in 1547, Staden declared that he would be leaving Hesse for India. He soon found himself in Latin America. While it could be argued that his immigration to several towns throughout Hesse led to his life of exploration, it is not clear what prompted him to leave Hesse.\n\nThroughout his endeavors as a traveler, Staden was known as a “go-between,” a mediator of sorts between the Europeans and the Indigenous tribes. In addition to mediation, he also acted as a broker and translator for the Europeans. He was a mediator in multiple aspects, including social, economic and trade. However, like any other “go-between,” he did not take sides.\n\nIt was because of Staden’s capture by the Tupinambá that he became a “go-between.” There are a couple main reasons for this. Unlike the many others of the time who were captured by indigenous tribes, pirates, and fugitive slaves, he contained abundant knowledge of the land, geography and people. The second main reason is that during his time as a captive, he made a conscious effort to learn the Tupinambá’s language, beliefs and customs.\n\nOnce Staden gained this abundant knowledge of Tupinambá, they became pawns in his game. He began to deceive them. He achieved this in multiple ways. He claimed that the tribe’s oracles and gourds, known as “Tamaraka,” were lying about him. He changed his self-image, in order to make his capturers fear him. In addition to working against them, he also made offers to be their healer, mercenary and even prophet. Due to his refusal to choose a side, it would seem unclear whether or not his manipulation of the Tupinambá helped or hurt his chances of being set free.\n\nIn 1552, after being released by Charles V, Staden returned home to Hesse, where he remained until his death in 1579. Allegedly, in 1556, he had even spoken to prince Landgrave Phillip about his book True History. It would come as another surprise when he classified his book as an adventure story and described the story as being much more leisurely than the actual events themselves.\n\nThe reception of Hans Staden’s narrative has been relatively positive. His book was a great success in 16th century Europe and was one of the most popular travel narratives of its time. Many critics agree that Staden’s novel is a fantastic source to learn about indigenous cultures and is quite incomparable to other sources about the same subject. Some modern critics have argued that Staden's account is one of the most reliable of its kind because he spent a long time in Brazil and spoke indigenous languages. However, depending on the edition, some critics take issue with the editors’ interpretation and introduction. Furthermore, some modern critics argue that Staden exaggerated accounts of cannibalism and even fabricated parts of his story based on similar narratives written by others. The novel has been translated into several languages, indicating its popularity. It has also been interpreted through several political and social movements in accordance to their agenda. The interpretations include a “children’s book … Antropofagia [Cannibalism] … Estado Novo … Cinema Novo … neo-nationalist and postmodern commemoration … [and] a forgettable and tedious movie.”\n\n\nDuring Staden's Adventures, a confrontation was at hand between the French, Spanish, and Portuguese whose naval power was unmatched at the time. They contended for resources, and control of global trading, which often resulted in violence. Due to Brazil's position as a top priority resource, it became a very violent place. Native tribes were forced to form alliances with western powers to survive. One tribe, known as the Tupiniquin, allied with the Portuguese, another called the Tupinamba allied with the French. As a mercenary, Staden fought for both Portugal and France, but eventually ended up part of a Garrison in a Portuguese settlement, which is why he was captured by the Tupinamba. Additionally, Staden's experiences was one of the first reported cases of cannibalism by a European, and caused turmoil in the world of Anthropology, which previously disputed the very existence of Cannibalism.\n\n"}

{"id": "18701420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18701420", "title": "Yehud coinage", "text": "Yehud coinage\n\nThe Yehud coinage is a series of small silver coins bearing the Aramaic inscription \"Yehud\". They derive their name from the inscription YHD (𐤉‬𐤄𐡃‬) , \"Yehud\", the Aramaic name of the Achaemenid Persian province of Yehud; others are inscribed YHDH, the same name in Hebrew.\n\nThe YHD coins are believed to date from the Persian period. On the other hand, it is possible that the YHDH coins are from the following Ptolemaic period.\n\nMildenburg dates Yehud coins from the early 4th century BCE to the reign of Ptolemy I (312–285 BCE), while Meshorer believes there was a gap during Ptolemy I's time and that minting resumed during Ptolemy II and continued into Ptolemy III, although this has been questioned. The earlier coins were almost certainly produced in imitation of Athenian coins, and were used locally as small change to supplement the larger denominations from more centralised mints elsewhere in the region.\n\nA lot of these coins were probably minted in Jerusalem.\n\nUnlike later Jewish coinage, Yehud coins depict living creatures, flowers and even human beings. \n\nDuring the First Temple period figural art was frequently used, such as the cherubim over the Ark of the Covenant, the twelve oxen that supported the giant laver in front of Solomon's Temple, etc. Thus, it is likely that the Yehud coins are continuing the use of figural art from the previous period. The prohibition against graven images in Exodus was probably seen as relating only to idolatrous images rather than the purely decorative.\n\nDepictions on the coinage include imagery borrowed from other cultures, such as the Athenian Owl, and various mythological creatures.\nThe lily flower was also commonly portrayed.\n\nVarious human images are also portrayed. Some coins bear images of Persian rulers. The identity of other human images are not always clear; some of them may even be images of Jewish leaders, such as Temple priests.\n\nOne coin depicts an enthroned deity, claimed by some experts to be Yahweh, while this is disputed by others. It has been suggested recently that this coin was actually minted in Samaria and depicts Samarian Yahweh.\n\nThe coins from the Persian period tend to be inscribed in Aramaic \"square script\" or Paleo-Hebrew and use the Aramaic spelling of the province as 'y-h-d', while those coins from the Ptolemaic/Hellenistic period (or maybe earlier) are inscribed in the Paleo-Hebrew script and usually spell Judea as 'y-h-d', 'y-h-d-h' or 'y-h-w-d-h'.\n\nRecent study by Yehoshua Zlotnik attempts to relate different kinds of coins, and the specifics of their manufacture to the changing political situation in Judea in the 4th century BCE. He deals with different coins-types, and with such unusual phenomena as minting on only one side of the coin, and seemingly deliberate flaws on certain dies. According to Zlotnik, these and other features can clarify the political state of affairs in Judah -- such as independence, autonomy, or transition period. Zlotnik also does a comparison of Yehud coins with contemporary coins from various neighbouring mints, such as Samaria, Edom and Sidon.\n\nMildenberg divides most of the Persian period 'Yehud' coinage into three groups: an early group of poorly defined coins with the head of Athena on the obverse with her owl on the reverse with the inscription 'y-h-d' in Paleo-Hebrew; the second group are more clearly defined and depict a lily, and an Egyptian falcon (see pictures), and the head of the Persian king, with the inscription 'y-h-d'; the third group has the Hebrew inscription 'Hezekiah the governor' (yhzqyh hphh). All these coins have been found in the area of Judea.\n\nThe Yehud coins come in two denominations, approximately .58 gram as a \"ma'ah\" and approximately .29 gram as a half \"ma'ah\" (\"chatzi ma'ah\"). These coins might have been minted in the first 40 years of the Second Temple era. For larger coinage, they first used Persian coinage, the Persian daric and the Sigloi; then Greek (Alexandrian Empire) coins like the drachma and the tetradrachm.\n\n\n\n"}
