According to the Kurdish history Sherefname, the title of the dynasty was \"Ayyar\" not \"Annaz\", therefore the alternative name Ayyarid is also used. \n\nAbul-Fath Mohammad bin Annaz (r. 990–1011) was the founder of the Annazid dynasty and ruled in Hulwan. Political conflicts during his twenty-year rule led to clashes in the west with the Arab clans \"Banu Oqayl\" (from whom he temporarily seized \"Daquq\" in 998) and the \"Banu Mazyad\", as well as a campaign against \"Zahman bin Hendi\", lord of Khanaqin, whose family he destroyed in 999. In the east, there was fierce competition between him and the \"Hasanwayhid\" Kurds (his relatives through marriage). In 1006, \"Badr bin Hasanuya\" aided by \"Abul-Hassan Ali bin Mazyad\", sent an army of 10,000 men against \"Abul-Fath\", who was compelled to seek refuge with the Buyid vizier, \"Amid-al-Joyus Abu Ali Hassan bin Abi Jafar\" in Baghdad. In a treaty concluded that year between the two Kurdish dynasties, \"Abul-Fath\" declared himself a \"Hasanwayhid\" vassal.\n\nHosam-al-Dawla Abul-Shawk (r. 1011–1046) was son of \"Abul-Fath Annaz\". His thirty-six-year rule was filled with internecine strife as well as external conflict. As a result, the extent of his authority grew a great deal, sometimes reaching as far as Hilla and at other times contracting to a narrow region in present-day western Iran. He inaugurated his reign by checking an attack by the forces of the new Buyid vizier, \"Fakhr-al-molk\", but he was compelled to retreat to Hulwan until a reconciliation was achieved. In 1029, he managed to defeat \"Shams-al-Dawla\" and stop the Seljuk Turks, after they seized Hamadan and attacked \"Dinawar\" and \"Asadabad\". In 1029, \"Abul-Shawk\" defeated the \"Oqayl\" and took \"Daquq\". In the period 1038–1039, he seized Kermanshah(\"Qarmisin\") and captured its ruler (a Quhid Kurd). In 1040, his son \"Abul-Fath Abul-Shawk\" tried to capture territories belonging to \"Mohalhel\" but was defeated and captured. \"Mohalhel\" secured assistance from \"Ala-al-Dawla bin Kakuya\", the ruler of Hamadan, and then he seized \"Dinawar\", Kermanshah, and other regions. \nRelations between \"Abul-Shawk\" and \"Mohalhel\" improved following the intervention of \"Jalal-al-Dawla\", but Mohalhel's refusal to release \"Abul-Fath bin Shawk\" led to renewed hostilities in 1040 and 1042, but he failed to release his son, who died in captivity. During the second campaign in 1042, Mohalhel caused great damage in \"Sanda\" (Sanandaj).\n\nIn 1045, Toghrul Beg sought to capture Annazid territories. During the campaign, the Kurdish governor of Hamadan fled, and \"Abul-Shawk\" retreated from Dinawar to Kermanshah and then to the citadel of Sirwan.\non the Diyala river, where a large number of Kurds rallied around him. \"Annazids\" where unable to stop the march of the Turks, which captured Hulwan and \"Mahidasht\" and attacked Khanaqin. \"Abul-Shawk\" died in the citadel of Sirwan in April 1046. His followers rallied around Mohalhel.\n\nThe strife between the Annazid chiefs continued during Mohalhel regime, especially when Sa'di bin Abul-Shawk sided with Yenal (he was the half-brother of Toghrul Beg) against his uncle. Yenal seized Hulwan in 1046 in the name of Hasanwayhid \"Badr bin Taher bin Helal\". After four years of reconciliation between the Annazids and the Seljuk, Mohalhel met Toghrul Beg in 1050, who confirmed his rule over Sirwan, \"Daquq\", \"Sharazor\" and \"Samagan\" and released his brother \"Sokrab\".\n\nA declining Annazid rule can be traced for several generations. The last mention occurs in the second half of 12th century, when Surkhab III ibn Annaz became one of the rulers of Lorestan. According to the Kurdish historian Ali ibn al-Athir and Sharafnama, the Annazid era lasted 130 years.\n\n\n\n"}

Retroactively coined in 1855 by theater critic Théophile Gautier, one of its chief aims was to liberate the conveyance of a story from dialogue, relying simply on quality of movement to communicate actions, motives, and emotions. The expression of dancers was highlighted in many of the influential works as a vital aspect of the ballet d’action. To become an embodiment of emotion or passion through free expression, movement, and realistic choreography was one chief aim of this dance. Thus, the mimetic aspect of dance was used to convey what the lack of dialogue could not. Certainly, there may have been codified gestures; however, a main tenant of the ballet d’action was to free dance from unrealistic symbolism, so this remains an elusive question. Often, props and costume object were involved in the performance to help clarify character interaction and passions. An example would be the scarf from \"La Fille Mal Gardee\", which represents the love of the male character and which the female character accepts after a coy moment. Props were thus used in harmony with dancer movement and expression. Programs for plays were also a place to explain the onstage action; however, overt clarifications were sometimes criticized for sullying the art of the ballet d’action.\n\nAlthough the French choreographer Jean-Georges Noverre is often credited with the original ideas and definitions of what he termed “ballet en action”, there were various other influences that contributed to the development of the genre. While Noverre’s 'Letter 1' provides a clear outline of his ideas of ballet d’action, he was not the first nor the last to develop a theory of a ballet in action.\n\n"}

Ravosa, who wrote music for children for decades, was one of the most popular songwriters for schools in America. He was an author and editor for Silver Burdett & Ginn's music textbook series \"World of Music\" and \"The Music Connection\", and the composer of the theme musicals in the two series. Ravosa also was the songwriter for the CBS children's shows \"Captain Kangaroo\" and \"Romper Room\", the PBS program \"Shining Time Station\", and the PBS publication \"Sesame Street Magazine\".\n\nMuch of Ravosa's life was spent as an educator. He was the music teacher at Fox Meadow Elementary School in Scarsdale, New York, where his original shows and songs were used in class plays. Subsequently, he was the Composer-in-Residence and Faculty Fellow at the Dalton School, a private school in New York City, and then Composer-in-Residence for the Edison Schools a nationwide charter school system. He was named The Hartt School Alumnus of the Year in 2009 and was honored in 2013 at the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society's annual dinner.\n\nCarmino Ravosa was born on January 29, 1930 in Springfield, Massachusetts, the oldest of three children, and the son of Anello and Elmira Ravosa. His father was an Italian immigrant who owned and operated a milk delivery business and had a strong love of jazz and big band music of the 1930s and 1940s, and was the greatest influence on Carmino's music career. Ravosa and his brother Anthony worked in their father's business for several years. Anthony later went on to become a lawyer and businessman in Springfield. After serving in the United States Army as a corporal in the U.S. Army Band, Ravosa attended The Hartt School of Music and graduated in 1957. He then earned a master's degree in Music Education from The Hartt School in 1965. At the school, he met his wife Claire Colby, who was a voice major there. The two were married for almost 60 years. Ravosa later earned a master's degree and an advanced degree from Columbia University.\n\nWith his wife Claire, Ravosa had three children, Carine, Gina, and Dean, and eight grandchildren. Ravosa and his family were prominent residents of the village of Briarcliff Manor in New York. Ravosa wrote numerous shows about the village, and was a musical director, lyricist, and keyboardist for the Briarcliff Manor Centennial Variety Show, a series of performances in 2002 that celebrated the village's centennial. Ravosa was also involved with preservation of Juniper Ledge, the Briarcliff Manor home of Carrie Chapman Catt. He added the home to the New York Register and the National Register of Historic Places. On July 6, 2013, Ravosa was honored by the Briarcliff Manor School District, which uses his music curriculum, during Todd Elementary School's annual fifth-grade concert.\n\nRavosa was a music teacher at the Fox Meadow School in Scarsdale, New York from 1965 to 1978. From 1978 to 1999, he served as Composer-in-Residence and Faculty Fellow at the Dalton School, a private school in New York City, where he was described as a \"Dalton legend\".

The original coonskin cap consisted of the entire skin of the raccoon including its head and tail. Beginning as traditional Native American headgear, coonskin caps became associated with American and Canadian frontiersmen of the 18th and 19th centuries, and were highly popular among boys in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia in the 1950s.\n\nCoonskin caps were originally a traditional Native American article of clothing. When Europeans began colonizing the Tennessee and Kentucky areas, the colonists started wearing them as hunting caps.\n\nThe coonskin cap eventually became a part of the iconic image associated with American frontiersmen such as Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett. Boone did not actually wear coonskin caps, which he disliked, and instead wore felt hats, but explorer Meriwether Lewis wore a coonskin cap during the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Joseph L. Meek wore the coonskin cap in the mountains.\n\nAn account of actor Noah Ludlow introducing the popular song \"The Hunters of Kentucky\" while wearing a coonskin cap is shown to be spurious in Ludlow's autobiography. Ludlow recounted that initial performance of 1822: \n\nAs soon as the comedy of the night was over, I dressed myself in a buckskin hunting-shirt and leggins, which I borrowed off a river man, and with moccasins on my feet and an old slouched hat on my head, and a rifle on my shoulder, I presented myself before the audience.\"\n\nPolitician Estes Kefauver of Tennessee adopted the coonskin cap as a personal trademark during his successful 1948 campaign for election to the United States Senate. Tennessee political boss E. H. Crump had published advertisements accusing Kefauver of being a raccoon-like Communist puppet. In response, Kefauver put on a coonskin cap during a speech in Memphis, proclaiming: \"I may be a pet coon, but I'm not Boss Crump's pet coon.\" He continued to use the coonskin cap as a trademark throughout his political career, which included unsuccessful campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1952 and 1956, an unsuccessful campaign for the Vice Presidency as Adlai Stevenson's running mate in 1956, and successful Senatorial re-election campaigns in 1954 and 1960.\n\nIn the 20th century, the iconic association was in large part due to Disney's television program \"Disneyland\" and the first three \"Davy Crockett\" episodes starring Fess Parker, which aired from December 1954 to February 1955. In the episodes, which once again made Crockett into one of the most popular men in the country, the frontier hero was portrayed wearing a coonskin cap. The show spawned several \"Disneyland\" Davy Crockett sequels as well as other similar shows and movies, with many of them featuring Parker as the lead actor. Parker went on to star in a \"Daniel Boone\" television series (1964-1970), again wearing a coonskin cap. \n\nCrockett's new popularity initiated a fad among boys all over the United States as well as a Davy Crockett craze in the United Kingdom. The look of the cap that was marketed to young boys was typically simplified; it was usually a faux fur lined skull cap with a raccoon tail attached. A variation was marketed to young girls as the Polly Crockett hat. It was similar in style to the boys' cap, including the long tail, but was made of all-white fur (faux or possibly rabbit). At the peak of the fad, coonskin caps sold at a rate of 5,000 caps a day. By the end of the 1950s, Crockett's popularity waned and the fad slowly died out. The fad is recalled by numerous cultural references, such as the wearing of coonskin caps as part of The Junior Woodchucks uniform in Disney's Donald Duck comics. Novelist Thomas Pynchon referenced both the hat and the fashion in his novel V., where he refers to the hat as a \"bushy Freudian hermaphrodite symbol\".\n\nCoonskin caps are powerful cultural symbols that continued to be seen in film, television, and other contexts in the latter decades of the 20th century.\n\n\n\n"}

For instance, the demilitarisation of Northern Ireland entailed the reduction of British security and military apparatuses. Demilitarisation in this sense is usually the result of a peace treaty ending a war or a major conflict. The principle is distinguished from demobilization, which refers to the drastic voluntary reduction in the size of a victorious army. \n\nDemilitarisation was a policy in a number of countries after both world wars. In the aftermath of World War I, the United Kingdom greatly reduced its military strength, which is also referred to as disarmament. The resulting position of British military weakness during the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany was among the causes that led to the policy of appeasement.\n\nThe conversion of a military or paramilitary force into a civilian one is also called demilitarisation. For example, the Italian Polizia di Stato demilitarised in 1981, and the Austrian Gendarmerie merged with the national police, making up a new civilian body. Demilitarisation can also refer to the policies employed by Allied forces during the occupation of Japan and Germany after World War II. The Japanese and German militaries were re-badged to disassociate them from their recent war history, but were kept active and reinforced to help the allies face the new Soviet threat that had become evident as World War 2 ended, and the Cold War began.\n\nDemilitarisation can also refer to the reduction of one or more types of weapons or weapons systems \"(See Arms Control)\" or the removal of combat equipment from a warship \"(See Japanese battleship Hiei)\".\n\nA demilitarised zone is a specific area, such as a buffer zone between nations previously engaged in armed conflict, where military persons, equipment or activities are forbidden. This can also include areas designated during conflicts in which nations, military powers or contending groups forbid military installations, activities or personnel. The demilitarised zone is also free from all activities that assist the war efforts of any of the belligerents. Generally, this zone is protected from attack and many countries forbid their troops from targeting because it would constitute a grave breach or a serious war crime that would likely warrant the institution of criminal proceedings. In the case, however, of the Korean Demilitarised Zone, of the areas beyond the demilitarized strip that separates both sides, are heavily militarized.\n\nExamples of demilitarisation include:\n\n\n"}

The principle refers to free access and distribution of goods, capital and services. In the Marxist view, such an arrangement will be made possible by the abundance of goods and services that a developed communist system will produce; the idea is that, with the full development of socialism and unfettered productive forces, there will be enough to satisfy everyone's needs.\n\nThe complete paragraph containing Marx's statement of the creed in the \"Critique of the Gotha Program\" is as follows:\nAlthough Marx is popularly thought of as the originator of the phrase, the slogan was common within the socialist movement. For example, it was used by August Becker in 1844 and Louis Blanc in 1851. The origin of this phrasing has also been attributed to the French utopian Étienne-Gabriel Morelly, who proposed in his 1755 \"Code of Nature\" \"Sacred and Fundamental Laws that would tear out the roots of vice and of all the evils of a society\", including:\nA similar phrase can be found in the Guilford Covenant in 1639:\nSome scholars trace the origin of the phrase to the New Testament. In Acts of the Apostles the lifestyle of the community of believers in Jerusalem is described as communal (without individual possession), and uses the phrase \"distribution was made unto every man according as he had need\" ():\nHowever, other scholars disagree with this, and claim that the phrase 'from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs' has a non-religious origin, in 'the Roman legal concept of obligation in solidum' The Roman legal concept of obligation in solidum is that 'everyone assumes responsibility for anyone who cannot pay his debt, and he is conversely responsible for everyone else'. James Furner then argues:\n\n'If x = a disadvantage, and y = action to redress that disadvantage, the principle of solidarity is: if any member of a group acquires x, each member has a duty to perform y (if they can assist). All we then need to add, to get to the fundamental principle of developed communism, is to assume that non-satisfaction of a need is a disadvantage. The corresponding principle of solidarity in respect of need says: if any member of society has an unsatisfied need, each member has a duty to produce its object (if they can). But that is precisely what the principle ‘from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs!’ dictates. In Marx’s vision, the basic principle of developed communism is a principle of solidarity in respect of need.' \n\nMarx delineated the specific conditions under which such a creed would be applicable—a society where technology and social organization had substantially eliminated the need for physical labor in the production of things, where \"labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want\". Marx explained his belief that, in such a society, each person would be motivated to work for the good of society despite the absence of a social mechanism \"compelling\" them to work, because work would have become a pleasurable and creative activity. Marx intended the initial part of his slogan, \"from each according to his ability\" to suggest not merely that each person should work as hard as they can, but that each person should best develop their particular talents.\n\nClaiming themselves to be at a \"lower stage of communism\" (i.e. \"socialism\", in line with Marx's terminology), the Soviet Union adapted the formula as: \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his work (labour investment)\".\n\nWhile liberation theology has sought to interpret the Christian call for justice in a way that is in harmony with this Marxist dictum, many have noted that Jesus' teaching in the \"Parable of the Talents\" (Matthew 25:14–30) affirms only \"TO each according to his ability\" (Matt. 25:15), and not \"FROM each according to his ability\".\n\n\n"}

It is a highly debated subject and there is a great deal to be discussed about it. One perspective on this worldwide movement is the Christian (religious) point of view. First of all, Christians believe in a higher authority, and aim to model their lives in obedience to their God. That being said, they value community and ultimately care for all the people their God has created. That is on a global scale, not only local. They feel a responsibility to the poor, and encourage globalization as it provides more opportunities for countries with weak economies that struggle with poverty. Work is valuable and there is importance in working in a global economy.\n\nThere are three main approaches to this topic from this perspective. There is the Evangelical Approach, Catholic Social teaching, and the Non-Evangelical Perspective.\n\nThe evangelical approach focuses on the spread of the gospel of Jesus Christ through globalization. Globalization opens many doors to many countries, and this perspective looks at that as an opportunity. It is an opportunity to spread the Christian teaching through the doors that have been opened. In this context globalization is seen as a tool, a stepping stone towards achieving the evangelical goal.\n\nThe Catholic social teaching looks at globalization with the aim of improving it. Improving it in the sense that they desire to shift the focus to a more humanitarian goal. Thomas Friedman wrote that, \"the more I observed the system of globalization at work, the more obvious it was that it had unleashed forest-crushing forces of development and Disney-round-the-clock homogenization which, if left unchecked, had the potential to destroy the environment and uproot cultures at a pace never before seen in human history.\" in his book \"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\" In this perspective, globalization is not viewed as a positive development, but can be seen as a way to reach more people and create a more socially conscious global environment.\n\nThe non-evangelical perspective highlights the benefits of globalisation through reach. It emphasizes the number of people now more easily contacted and the cultures more easily understood. In this view the focus is not the spread of the gospel but the connecting of the \"body of Christ\" on a global level. It is basically the universal church being more easily unified through the barriers broken down by globalization.\n"}

His tough macroeconomic adjustment measures were unpopular, but he succeeded in pushing a limited number of modernization initiatives through Congress. Durán Ballén's vice president, Alberto Dahik, was the architect of the administration's economic policies, but in 1995, Dahik fled the country to avoid prosecution on corruption charges following a heated political battle with the opposition. A war with Peru (named the Cenepa War, after a river located in the area) erupted in January–February 1995 in a small, remote region, where the boundary prescribed by the 1942 Rio Protocol was in dispute. The Durán-Ballén Administration can be credited with beginning the negotiations that would end in a final settlement of the territorial dispute.\n\nIn 1996, Abdalá Bucaram, from the populist Ecuadorian Roldosista Party, won the presidency on a platform that promised populist economic and social reforms. Almost from the start, Bucaram's administration languished amidst widespread allegations of corruption. Empowered by the president's unpopularity with organized labor, business, and professional organizations alike, Congress unseated Bucaram in February 1997 on grounds of mental incompetence. The Congress replaced Bucaram with Interim President Fabián Alarcón.\n\nIn May 1997, following the demonstrations that led to the ousting of Bucaram and appointment of Alarcón, the people of Ecuador called for a National Assembly to reform the Constitution and the country's political structure. After a little more than a year, the National Assembly produced a new Constitution.\n\nCongressional and first-round presidential elections were held on May 31, 1998. No presidential candidate obtained a majority, so a run-off election between the top two candidates - Quito Mayor Jamil Mahuad of the DP and the Right Wing Álvaro Noboa - was held on July 12, 1998. Mahuad won by a narrow margin. He took office on August 10, 1998. On the same day, Ecuador's new constitution came into effect.\n\nMahuad concluded a well-received peace with Peru on October 26, 1998, but increasing economic, fiscal, and financial difficulties drove his popularity steadily lower. However, the coup de grace for Mahuad's administration was Mahuad's decision to make the local currency, the sucre (named after Antonio José de Sucre), obsolete and replace it with the U.S. dollar (a policy called dollarization). This caused massive unrest as the lower classes struggled to convert their now useless sucres to U.S. dollars and lost wealth, while the upper classes (whose members already had their wealth invested in U.S. dollars) gained wealth in turn. Under Mahuad's recession-plagued term, the economy shrank significantly and inflation reached levels of up to 60 percent.\n"}

The origins of its inhabitants are somewhat obscure.\n\nIt is known that proto-Kabardians called Kassogs were inhabiting that area already in the 9th century, as the Arab traveler Al Masudi speaks of them. \nBalkars were part of Alania and one of the Vainakh tribes, who were influenced by Turkic culture after the Mongol invasion's split of the lowlands of Nakh tribes and adopted the language. Also genetically they are closely related to Chechens and Ingush.\n\nThe region came under the control of the Mongols between 1242-1295. It passed into the hands of the Georgians from 1295 to 1505 before falling, briefly, into the orbit of the Persian Empire between 1502-1516. It was then ruled by the Ottoman Empire from 1516-1557. From 1557, it became a protectorate of the expanding Russian state – first Muscovy, then the Russian Empire. See Kabardia.\n\nKabardia gained independence briefly between 1739–1774, before being annexed by Russia under the terms of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Balkaria was annexed in 1827. The Russians established a number of forts in the region, notably at Nalchik (the republic's present-day capital), to secure their control over it. A significant number of Russians – many of Cossack descent – also settled there.\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the region became part of the anti-communist South-Eastern League (1917–1918), then joined the Mountain Peoples’ Autonomous Republic in 1921. On September 1, 1921, with the emergence of the Soviet Union, the territories were organized into the Kabardin Autonomous Oblast. The region's name was changed to the Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Oblast the following year, and on December 5, 1936 it was elevated in status and named Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nIn 1944, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin falsely accused the Balkars of collaborating with Nazi Germany and deported the entire population. Their name was deleted from the territory, which was renamed the Kabardin ASSR. The Balkar population was only allowed to return in 1957 at which point its pre-war name was restored.\n\nKabardino-Balkaria became a full republic in 1991 and in March 1992 became one of the constituent republics of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe republic's economy was very hard hit by the fall of the Soviet Union and the outbreak of war in neighboring Georgia and nearby Chechnya. The instability produced by the conflicts led to a collapse in tourism in the region and produced an unemployment level estimated to be as high as 90%. The republic's mainly Muslim population has become increasingly radicalised by the region's instability. In October 2005, Kabardino-Balkaria's capital Nalchik was the site of fighting after an attack on the city by Chechen militants.\n"}
{"id": "11394933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11394933", "title": "History of the Székely people", "text": "History of the Székely people\n\nThe history of the Székely people (a subgroup of the Hungarians in Romania) can be documented from the 12th century. According to medieval chronicles, the Székelys were descended from the Huns who settled in the Carpathian Basin in the 5th century. This theory was refuted by modern scholars, but no consensual view about the origin of the Székelys exists. They fought in the vanguard of the Hungarian army, implying that they had been a separate ethnic group, but their tongue does not show any trace of a language shift.\n\nScattered communities of light-armored Székely warriors lived in the Kingdom of Hungary, especially along the western frontier till the 14th century. Their migration to Transylvania began in the 11th or 12th century. They first settled in southern Transylvania, but they moved to present-day Székely Land after the arrival of the Transylvanian Saxons in the late 12th century. They were subjected to a royal official, the Count of the Székelys, from the 1220s. Their military role enabled them to preserve their privileged status. They did not pay tax and the kings of Hungary could not grant landed property in Székely Land. Their basic administrative units, known as seats from the 14th century, were headed by elected lieutenants and seat judges. They formed one of the \"Three Nations of Transylvania\" after a \"brotherly union\" was formed by the noblemen, Székelys and Saxons against the rebellious Transylvanian peasants in 1437.\n\nThe existence of three groups within the Székely society became evident in the 15th century. The commoners (or \"pixidarii\") held small parcels of land and fought as foot soldiers. The wealthier \"primipili\" were mounted warriors. The high-ranking \"primores\", who often also owned estates outside Székely Land, began to expand their authority over the commoners. Royal judges, appointed by the counts of the Székelys, supervised the elected officials of the seats from the 1460s. Being unable to serve in the army, the commoners lost their tax exemption in the 1550s. Many of them were reduced to serfdom after their rebellion was suppressed in 1562. The position of the royal judges was also strengthened, limiting the autonomy of the seats. On the other hand, the liberties of the Székely towns were confirmed. Although most Székelys remained Roman Catholic, significant groups adhered to Calvinism, Unitarianism or Sabbatarianism in the 16th century. The Székelys' privileges were restored in the 17th century, but many commoners (who did not want to serve in the army) voluntarily entered into serfdom. After Transylvania became part of the Habsburg Empire in the 1690s, the central government made attempts to limit the Székelys' liberties. Hundreds of villages were integrated into the Military Frontier after the \"Siculicidium\" (or Massacre of Székelys) at Madéfalva in 1764, but thousands of Székelys migrated to Moldavia to avoid military service. The Székely border guards lived under strict military rules.\n\nMedieval chronicles unanimously stated that the Székelys were descended from the 5th-century Huns. The \"Gesta Hungarorum\" and Simon of Kéza were the first to mention this information. The Székelys' own tradition of their Hunnic origin is well-documented, but it is impossible to decide whether it is a genuine part of their folklore or an adoption of the medieval chroniclers' invention. Most modern historians refute the Székelys' association with the Huns.\n\nBálint Hóman was the first to propose that the Székelys were a Turkic group that joined the Magyars in the Pontic steppes. György Györffy likewise said, the Székelys were obviously a separate ethnic group, because they fought in the vanguard of the Hungarian army. Györffy and Gyula Kristó associated the Székelys with the Eskils (a tribe in Volga Bulgaria in the 9th century). Kristó proposed that the Eskils was one of the three tribes of the Kabars who joined the Magyars after their secession from the Khazar Empire. Gyula Németh and other linguists refuted the two peoples' identification, stating that their ethnonyms are not connected.\n\nAccording to most linguists and several historians, the Székelys did not change their language, because they speak the Hungarian language \"without any trace of a Turkic substratum\". Linguist Lóránd Benkő asserted that the Székely dialects are closely connected to Hungarian dialects spoken along the borders of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Consequently, he proposed that the Székelys were descended from the military guardians of the frontiers. Their military role secured their special privileges, contributing to the development of their own consciousness. Gyula László and Pál Engel proposed that the Székelys were descended from the (supposedly Hungarian-speaking) \"Late Avar\" (or Onogur) population of the Carpathian Basin. The theory of the \"double conquest\" of the Carpathian Basin by the Hungarians has never been widely accepted.\n\nRoyal charters indicate that scattered Székely groups lived in many regions of the Kingdom of Hungary. A charter mentioned a military unit called \"Sceculzaz centurionatus\" (\"Székelyszáz hundred\") in Bihar County in 1217. A 1256 diploma referred to a forest at Boleráz in Pozsony County (now in Slovakia) which was located \"towards the Székelys\". The Székely warriors of Nagyváty in Baranya County were mentioned in 1272. A 1314 royal charter stated that long time before Székelys had lived in an estate in Sopron County. The Székelys of Sásvár in Ugocsa County (present-day Trosnik in Ukraine) were mentioned in 1323.\n\nThe three main dialects of their tongue indicate that the Székelys' ancestors lived along the western frontiers. The Székelys who now live along the rivers Nyárád and Kis-Küküllő (Niraj and Târnava Mică, respectively in Romania) speak a dialect similar to the tongue of the Hungarian communities near Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia). The dialect of Udvarhelyszék is closely related to the Hungarian variant spoken in Burgenland (now in Austria). The third Hungarian variant of the Székely Land is similar to the Hungarian dialect of Baranya County.\n\nSzékely and Pecheneg warriors fought side by side in the army of Stephen II of Hungary in the Battle of Olšava in 1116, according to the 14th-century \"Illuminated Chronicle\". The author of the chronicle blamed the Székelys and Pechenegs for the king's defeat, calling them as \"the most wretched poltroons\" because of their unexpected retreat from the battlefield. Györffy argues, thir flight from the battlefield was actually a feigned retreat which was an element of nomadic military tactics. The same source recorded that the \"wretched\" Pechenges and the \"worthless\" Székelys \"as usual went before the Hungarian army\" in the Battle of the Fischa in 1146, evidencing that they fought in the vanguard. The derogatory adjectives show that the Székelys were lightly armored archers.\n\nThe Székelys were divided into six \"kindreds\"; and each \"kindred\" was composed of four \"lineages\". All kindreds were documented in each district in Székely Land, implying that the kindreds had come into being by the time the Székelys settled in the territory. The names of two kindreds and five lineages had their roots in Christian names.\n\nThe exact date of the settlement of the Székelys in Transylvania cannot be determined. Simon of Kéza wrote that the Székelys \"acquired part of the country ... not in the plains of Pannonia but in the mountains, which they shared with the Vlachs, mingling with them, it is said\". Gyula Kristó says that the increase of the military role of the eastern borderlands caused their movement, because skirmishes along the western frontier became rare during the 12th century. Pál Engel, Zoltán Kordé and Tudor Sălăgean argue that the kings of Hungary settled the Székelys in Transylvania in several stages. Kristó adds, several Székely border guards voluntarily left for Transylvania, because the disintegration of the \"marchias\" (or border counties) threatened their freedom.\n\nThe first groups allegedly settled in southern Transylvania, along the rivers Kézd, Orbó, and Sebes (now Saschiz, Gârbova and Sebeș in Romania), because three administrative units in Székely LandKézdiszék, Orbaiszék and Sepsiszékwere named after these rivers. Early 12th-century cemeteries unearthed at Szászsebes and Homoróddaróc (now Sebeș and Drăuşeni in Romania) evidence that the region had been inhabited before the arrival of the ancestors of the Transylvanian Saxons. The Székelys who lived around Telegd in Bihar County (now Tileagd in Romania) also moved to Transylvania, because a group of the Székelys was known as the Székelys of Telegd in the 13th century.\n\nJoachim, Count of Hermannstadt, led an army of Saxons, Vlachs, Székelys and Pechenegs across the Carpathian Mountains to fight for Boril of Bulgaria around 1210, according to a royal charter issued in 1250. The record suggests that the four ethnic groups were subjected to the Counts of Hermannstadt in the early 13th century. \nWilliam, Bishop of Transylvania, granted the tithe in Burzenland to the Teutonic Knights in 1213, but preserved the right to collect the tithe from the Székelys (and Hungarians) who would settle in the region. The grant shows that significant Székely groups were on the move in the early 13th century. The \"land of the Székelys\" was located to the north and northeast of the domain of the Knights in 1222. Two years later, Andrew II granted the land of the Székelys of Sebes to the west of the Olt River to the Transylvanian Saxons, thus uniting the territories where Saxons had settled in southern Transylvania under the jurisdiction of the Count of Hermannstadt.\n\nThe adoption of more than a dozen place names of Slavic origin suggests that scattered Slavic-speaking communities inhabited present-day Székely Land at the time of the Székelys' arrival. More than a dozen place names representing the oldest layer of Hungarian place names (personal names in the nominative case), implies that other Hungarian-speaking groups had also preceded the Székelys. The same conclusion can be drawn from the existence of the enclaves of Fehér County in Székely Land which survived until the 19th century.\n\nThe Székelys were put under the jurisdiction of a new royal official, the Count of the Székelys, in the early 13th century. The first known count, Bogomer, son of Szoboszló, was captured during a campaign that Béla, Duke of Transylvania, launched against Bulgaria in 1228. The monarchs always appointed the counts from among the Hungarian noblemen. The main administrative units of Székely Land were initially known as \"terra\" (or land). The \"Diploma Andreanum\" contained the first reference to such a territory, mentioning \"terra Sebes\" (\"the land of the Székelys of Sebes\") in 1224.\n\nThe Mongol invasion of the Kingdom of Hungary obviously caused less destruction in Székely Land than in other regions of Hungary. Only two years after the withdrawal of the Mongols, Székely troops accompanied Lawrence, Voivode of Transylvania, to the Principality of Halych-Volhynia. Székely warriors fought in the royal army against the Czechs and Austrians in the Battle of Kressenbrunn in 1260. Stephen V of Hungary granted the royal domains along the Aranyos River (now Arieș in Romania) to the Székelys of Kézd, who established 18 villages in two decades. The Mongols again invaded the Kingdom of Hungary in 1285. The Székelys, Vlachs and Saxons resisted the invaders at the border, hindering their sudden attack. The Székelys of Aranyos successfully defended Torockó (now Rimetea in Romania), forcing the invaders to set hundreds of captives free.\nThe Székelys did not receive a royal diploma summarizing their liberties, but royal charters evidence that they had a special legal status. The Székelys were not subjected to the authority of the voivodes and the \"ispáns\" (or heads) of the counties. Their landed property could not be confiscated in favor of the royal treasury. Neither could the monarchs grant estates in Székely Land. Béla IV, who wanted to reward one \"Comes\" Vincent for his services, donated him an estate in Fehér County (outside Székely Land) in 1252. Vincent was obviously the head of a Székely kindred, because four families which descended from him gave the highest officials of Sepsiszék for centuries. The Székelys prevented two noblemen from taking possession of an estate (Lok) that Charles I of Hungary had granted them in Csík in 1324.\n\nInstead of individuals, the community owned most lands in Székely Land. Stephen V of Hungary had to instruct the \"universitas\" (or community) of the Székelys of Telegd in the early 1270s to receive two men into their society, allowing them to hold their estates \"without borders, like the Székelys\". Parcels of the communal lands were time to time divided through \"drawing arrows\". Communal property diminished through deforestation and the draining of marshlands, because such territories were seized by the individuals who had transformed the land. The Székelys did not pay taxes, but the owners of landed property in Székely Land were required to serve in the royal army. Daughters could only inherit landed property if they had no brothers. A daughter who inherited an estate (known as a \"boy-daughter\") had to equip a warrior to fight on her behalf. The Székelys gave 80 horses to Ladislaus IV of Hungary in the late 13th century. Later, each Székely household was required to give an ox to the king on the occasions of his marriage and the birth of his eldest son.\n\nThe Székelys' collective privileges strengthened in the 1290s. Their representatives attained the general assembly that Andrew III of Hungary held at Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania) in 1291. Ehelleus Ákos, Vice-Voivode of Transylvania, granted the fortress on Székelykő at Torockó (now Piatra Secuiului in Romania) to the Székelys of Aranyos. The Székelys were also represented at the Diet of Hungary in Pest in 1298.\n\nTaking advantage of the collapse of the royal authority, Ladislaus III Kán took control of Transylvania in the 1290s. In 1296, he held a general assembly near Torda (now Turda in Romania) where the head of the Székelys of Aranyos were also present. However, the Székelys did not support his sons' rebellion against Charles I of Hungary in the late 1310s.\n\nThe register of the papal tithe (the tenth part of each clergyman's revenues which was to be paid to the pope) between 1330 and 1337 is the first document to provide detailed information of the Roman Catholic parishes in Székely Land. At least 150 parishes were mentioned in the document, showing that a church had been built in at least 80% of the villages (this ratio did not exceed 40% in other regions of the kingdom). The parishes were divided among four archdeaneries of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Transylvania. The presence of Orthodox communities in this period has not been demonstrated.\n\nThe Székely administrative units were known as \"széks\" (or seats) from the middle of the 14th century. There were initially seven seats, but Stibor of Stiboricz, Voivode of Transylvania, authorized the community of Miklósvár (now Micloșoara in Romania) to set up its own court of justice around 1395. The other seats only acknowledged the establishment of Miklósvárszék in 1459. Each seat was headed by two elected officials, the lieutenant \"(maior exercitus)\" and the seat judge \"(iudex terrestris)\". Theoretically, lieutenants were responsible for the military affairs and seat judges administered justice, but lieutenants also heard legal disputes. Both seat judges and lieutenants heard disputes together with twelve jurors.\n\nOnly Székelys who owned landed property known as \"Székely inheritance\" could be elected lieutenants or seat judges. Such property almost always included a mill, increasing the revenues of its owner. \"Székely inheritances\" were divided among the lineages, because the right to nominate and elect the officials of a seat moved from lineage to lineage in each year. Consequently, members of the families who owned more than one \"Székely inheritance\" held the offices more frequently than others.\n\nMost Székely villages were named either after a lineage, or after individuals, known from 13th- and 14th-century charters. Unlike the villages in the counties, the Székely villages preserved their autonomous status. Ten families made up the basic administrative units (known as \"tenth\") of Székely Land. Tenths supervised the regular division of the communal lands.\n\nTenths were also responsible for the mobilization of the Székely warriors. The Székelys' military obligations did not diminish in the 14th century. Andrew Lackfi, Count of the Székelys, launched a campaign against the Golden Horde in 1345. His victory enabled the expansion of Hungary across the Carpathian Mountains and contributed to the establishment of Moldavia. Székely troops also participated in the campaigns of Louis I of Hungary in Italy, Lithuania, Serbia and Bulgaria. Stephen Kanizsai commanded the Székely warriors in the Battle of Nicopolis, which ended with the catastrophic defeat of the Christian army by the Ottomans in 1396.\n\nThe Székelys primarily grew grain, onion, cabbage, hops, hemp and flax in the late 15th century. Apple, pear, plum, walnut and hazelnut were the characteristic fruits of Székely Land. The breeding of horses and cattle was also important segment of the local economy. The Székelys also traded in skins of wolves, foxes, squirrels, martens and other wild animals. The staple right of the Saxon town of Brassó hindered the development of the nearby Székely towns, especially that of Sepsiszentgyörgy (now Sfântu Gheorghe in Romania). A royal charter recorded that a town was located in each seat in 1427, but most towns received privileges only during the following century.\n\nThe existence of legally distinct groups of the Székely society was first documented in the early 15th century, but the origin of the three main groups can be traced back to the previous centuries. Archaeologist Elek Benkő proposes that the tripartite Székely community (consisting of the high-ranking \"primores\" and \"primipili\", and the commoners) preserved the features of the 11th-century Hungarian society. The number of Székelys who could not secure their living increased due to the divisions of landed property through inheritance in the 15th century. The poor entered the service of wealthy landowners. On the other hand, Székelys who participated in military campaigns had the opportunity to receive land grants outside Székely Land. Hungarian noblemen could seize a \"Székely inheritance\" through marriage or purchase. Consequently, the wealthiest landowners held offices in both the seats and the counties. For their estates in the counties were cultivated by dependent peasants, they also wanted to reduce the freedom of the commoners who worked on their estates in Székely Land.\n\nThe Hungarian and Vlach peasants rose up in the Transylvanian counties in spring 1437. Roland Lépes, Vice-Voivode of Transylvania, sought assistance from the Székelys and Saxons against them. The representatives of the counties and the Székely and Saxon seats assembled at Bábolna (now Bobâlna in Romania). They signed a \"brotherly union\" on 16 September, pledging that they would assist each other against all but the monarch. After their united army defeated the peasants, they confirmed their alliance on 2 February 1438, which gave rise to the concept of the \"Three Nations of Transylvania\".\n\nOttoman marauders made regulars incursions in Transylvania from the early 15th century. Ottoman raiders routed an army of Székelys and Saxons at Brassó (now Brașov in Romania) in 1421; Ottoman, Wallachian and Moldavian troops made an incursion in Székely Land in 1432; Ottomans broke into Székely Land in 1438. Sigismund, King of Hungary, had already in 1419 ordered that a third of the Transylvanian noblemen and a tenth of the peasants had to take up arms in case of an Ottoman invasion to assist the Székelys and Saxons in defending the borders. The churches of Székely Land reflected a \"frontier-guard mentality\". Churches in Csíkszék were fortified in the 15th century. Frescoes on the walls of many churches represented King St Ladislaus's legendary fight with a \"Cuman\" warrior. Episodes of the life of Saint Margaret of Antioch were also depicted on the walls of at least 8 churches. Most frescoes were painted in Byzantine style. The first references to Székely primary schools were recorded in the 15th century. A schoolmaster lived in Hídvég (now Hăghig in Romania), and a teacher in Előpatak (now Vâlcele) in 1419.\n\nTo secure the unified command of the borders, Vladislaus I of Hungary made John Hunyadi, Ban of Szörény, and Nicholas Újlaki, Ban of Macsó, the joint voivodes of Transylvania and counts of the Székelys in 1441. Székely warriors accompanied Hunyadi during his campaigns in the Balkan Peninsula. At Hunyadi's order, Nicholas Vízaknai, Vice-Voivode of Transylvania, and John Geréb of Vingárt, Castellan of Görgény (now Gurghiu in Romania), held an assembly for 24 Székely jurors in Marosvásárhely in 1451 to record customary laws. This first known legislative assembly of the Székelys decreed that those who possessed landed property for 32 years acquired the title to it.\n\nHunyadi's son, Matthias Corvinus, was elected king in 1458. He confirmed the right of the Székelys of Kászon region to freely elect a lieutenant and a seat judge in 1462. The offices of voivode of Transylvania and count of the Székelys were in practise united in the 1460s, because thereafter the kings always appointed the same noblemen to both offices. To secure the military potential of the Székely community, Matthias ordered the collection of the liberties of the commoners in 1466. The joint assembly of the Transylvanian noblemen and the Székely elders decreed that a Székely could not be forced to work on a landowner's estate. The assembly also ruled that two-thirds of the jurors were to be elected from among the commoners. Thereafter, the counts of the Székelys appointed a \"royal judge\" (or \"iudex regius\") to supervise the administration of justice in each seat.\n\nImpoverished Székely commoners, however, could not fight as mounted warriors, forcing Matthias to revise his policy. In 1473, he issued a new decree which distinguished the military obligations of the three main Székely groups. The \"pimores\", who owned an estate with a territory of at least three \"bowshots\", were thereafter required to equip three mounted warriors. The \"primipili\", who owned an estate with a territory of two \"bowshots\", continued to fight as mounted soldiers in person. The Székely commoners, or \"pixidarii\", were obliged to fight only as foot-soldiers.\n\nStephen Báthory, Voivode of Transylvania and Count of the Székelys, made several attempts to reduce the autonomy of the seats in the early 1490s. Accusing many \"primores\" of high treason, he confiscated their estates and forced Székely heiresses to marry his retainers. At the Székelys' demand, Vladislaus II of Hungary replaced Báthory with Bartholomew Drágffy and Stephen Losonczy in 1493. However, Drágffy, Losonczy and their successors neglected the administration of justice. János Bögözi, Lieutenant of Udvarhelyszék, convoked the general assembly, which set up an appellate court in 1505.\n\nThe Székelys' self-consciousness strengthened after their identifications as Huns was published in printed books in the late 15th century. They regarded themselves as the representatives of the Huns' military virtues and began demanding the recognition of their privileged status. After King Vladislaus II's only son, Louis, was born on 1 July 1506, royal officials came to Székely Land to collect the oxen which had traditionally been given to the monarchs on similar occasions. However, the custom had been forgotten, because the kings had not fathered sons during the previous century. Stating that they were noblemen (who did not pay taxes), the Székelys refused to give oxen to the royal officials. The commander of the royal army, Pál Tomori, could only suppress the riot with the assistance of Saxon troops. András Lázár convoked a new general assembly to Agyagfalva (now Lutiţa in Romania), which banished those who had conspired against the monarch and confiscated their landed property.\n\nThe leader of the great uprising of the Hungarian peasants in 1514, György Dózsa, was of Székely origin, but the Székely commoners did not support the rebels. John Zápolya, who had been count of the Székelys since 1510, played a preeminent role in the victory of the noblemen over the peasants. He also suppressed a revolt of the Székely commoners in 1519. He ignored the special status of landed property in Székely Land and confiscated the rioters' estates in favor of the royal treasury.\n\nThe Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Hungarian army in the Battle of Mohács on 29 August 1526. For Louis II of Hungary died in the battlefield, John Zápolya and Ferdinand of Habsburg laid claim to Hungary. Both claimants were elected kings before the end of the year. The Székelys supported John. After he made an alliance with the Ottomans, the sultan instructed Petru Rareș, Voivode of Moldavia, to invade Transylvania through Székely Land to fight against Ferdinand's local supporters in 1529.\n\nIn 1538, John recognized Ferdinand's right to reunite Hungary after his death. However, John's supporters proclaimed his infant son, John Sigismund, king after he died in 1540. Taking advantage of the new civil war, Suleiman occupied central Hungary, but allowed John Sigismund to retain the lands to the east of the Tisza River. The minor king and his mother, Isabella Jagiellon, settled in Transylvania in 1542.\n\nJohannes Honter, the Lutheran priest of Brassó, sent preachers to Székely Land in the 1540s. The wealthy Pál Daczó, who renovated the old church of Sepsiszentgyörgy (now Sfântu Gheorghe in Romania) \"for the glory of God\" in 1547, was the first Székely to certainly adopt Lutheranism. Most villages in Miklósvárszék adhered to Lutheranism by the early 1550s, but the majority of the Székelys remained Roman Catholic. The Reformation also contributed to the development of education. New schools were opened in dozens of settlements, including Székelykál and Gidófalva (now Căluşeri and Ghidfalău in Romania). The high schools at Marosvásárhely and Székelyudvarhely became the first institutions of secondary education.\n\nIsabella renounced her son's realm in favor of Ferdinand of Habsburg in 1551. Ferdinand made István Dobó and Ferenc Kendi voivodes of Transylvania. The two voivodes confirmed the privileges of the Székelys in 1555. John Sigismund and his mother returned to Transylvania in 1556. During the following years, the Diet passed a series of decrees limiting the Székelys' liberties. In 1557, the king was authorized to confiscate the estates of the Székelys who had been sentenced for high treason. A year later, the Székely community was forced to pay a lump sum tax of 5,000 florins, only the \"primores\" and the \"primipili\" who were descended from 15th-century notables were exempted. On the other hand, the queen declared that the Székely towns were required only to contribute to the yearly tribute payable to the sultans. The towns were also exempted from the jurisdiction of the seats.\n\nAfter Melchior Balassa rebelled against John Sigismund, the \"primipili\" assembled at Székelyudvarhely in April 1562. Thousands of commoners joined them, demanding the punishment of the wealthy Székelys whom they accused of unlawful collection of taxes and predatory lending. The commoners attacked manors and defeated a royal army. However, their army broke up without resistance after John Sigismund routed a small troop. The Diet passed decrees to limit the commoners' freedom on 20 June 1562. The court of appeal of Székely Land was dissolved, the commoners' right to be elected jurors was abolished and the royal judges became the sole leaders of the seats. Two royal castles named Székelytámad (\"Székely-assault\") and Székelybánja (\"Székely-regret\") were erected in Székely Land. The Székely commoners were not required to fight in the royal army, which deprived them from the legal basis of their freedom. They were regarded the king's serfs, and many of them were forced to work at the building of royal castles or in the salt mines. John Sigismund donated hundreds of Székely serfs to his supporters after 1566.\n\nHungarian-speaking preachers promoted the theology of John Calvin from the late 1550s. The synod of Marosvásárhely accepted Calvin's views of the Eucharist in 1559. The creed was the first document of a Church assembly to be recorded in Hungarian. In 1568, the Diet declared that all preachers could preach \"according to his own understanding\", which contributed to the spread of Anti-Trinitarian views. Most Székely villages persisted with Roman Catholicism, but some Calvinist settlements joined the newly established Unitarian Church of Transylvania.\n\nJohn Sigismund styled himself \"prince of Transylvania\" after the Treaty of Speyer in 1570. Shortly after his death, armed Székely commoners marched to Gyulafehérvár to demand the restoration of their freedom from his successor, Stephen Báthory. After Báthory refused them, hundreds of Székelys joined his opponent, Gáspár Bekes. After Báthory defeated Bekes in 1575, more than 60 Székelys were executed or mutilated, and Báthory's supporters received Székely serfs.\n\nAnti-Trinitarian preachers who discouraged the adoration of Jesus appeared in Székely Land in the late 1570s. Individual interpretation of the Bible became popular in the 1580s. The idea of social equality in the Old Testament corresponded to the Székely traditions, which contributed to the spread of \"Judaizing\" views among the Székelys. András Eőssi was the first leader of the Szekler Sabbatarians. After the Diet ordered the persecution of radical Protestants in 1595, Benedek Mindszenti, Captain of Udvarhelyszék, forced hundreds of Sabbatarians to leave Transylvania in 1595.\n\nStephen Báthory's successor, Sigismund Báthory, joined the Holy League that Pope Clement VIII organized against the Ottoman Empire. After Sigismund promised the restoration of the Székelys' liberties if they took up arms against the Ottomans, more than 20,000 Székelys joined the royal army. The united troops of Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldavia defeated the Ottomans in the Battle of Giurgiu. Although the Székely serfs' contribution to the victory was undeniable, the landowners refused to grant them freedom. After Sigismund also revoked his promise, the serfs rose up. Stephen Bocskai crushed the revolt with extraordinary brutality during the \"Bloody Carnival\" of 1596.\nSigismund abdicated in favor of his cousin, Andrew Báthory, in March 1599. Andrew's pro-Ottoman foreign policy threatened Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, who decided to invade Transylvania. The Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph II, who had laid claim to Transylvania, supported him. After Michael presented a fake document in which Rudolph pledged that he would liberate the Székely serfs, thousand of Székelys joined Michael's army, but many Székely noblemen remained faithful to Andrew. Andrew was murdered by Székely peasants after Michael's victory in the Battle of Sellenberk. Michael the Brave restored the Székely commoners' freedom, and they took revenge for the Bloody Carnival.\n\nTransylvania sank into political anarchy during the following years. Rudolph's general, Giorgio Basta, expelled Michael from Transylvania and abolished the Székelys' liberties. Moses Székely (the only prince of Székely origin) took up arms against Basta in 1603. Most Székelys of Udvarhelyszék, Marosszék and Aranyosszék supported him, but the majority of the Székelys from other seats joined his opponent, Radu Șerban, Voivode of Wallachia. János Petki, Captain of Udvarhelyszék, convoked the general assembly of the Székelys shortly after Stephen Bocskai had risen up against Rudolph in October 1604. The Székely noblemen and commoners unanimously decided to support Bocskai if he was willing to confirm their liberties and to grant a general amnesty for the crimes committed during the anarchy. Bocskai confirmed the Székelys' liberties in a charter on 16 February 1606. Five days later, the delegates of the counties and the Székelys proclaimed him prince.\n\nThe restoration of the Székely liberties included the Székely serfs' exemption from regular taxes. For the serfs did not serve in the royal army, many Székely commoners entered into the service of wealthier landowners. About 44% of the Székelys were serfs, according to the conscription in 1614. Most serfs in Marosszék declared that they had voluntarily chosen serfdom to avoid poverty, starvation and military service.\n\nThe detailed \"memoire\" of the Székely nobleman, Ferenc Mikó, is an important source of Transylvanian history between 1594 and 1613. The development of large estates transformed the Székely society. More than a hundred peasants worked on the domains of the wealthiest landowners. They renovated their old castles, or built new castles, strengthening them by walls and towers in the 17th century. Lesser noblemen's manors were mostly decorated by wooden \"Székely gates\".\n\nThe landowners invited colonists to settle in their lands. The 1614 conscription mentioned peasants named \"Oláh\" (or Vlach) who had come from Moldavia, Wallachia or from the region of Fogaras and Karánsebes (now Făgăraș and Caransebeș in Romania). The presence of colonists and serfs in the Székely villages required the adoption of new rules regarding the distribution of communal lands. For instance, the community of Udvarfalva (now Curteni in Romania) allowed two serfs to seize parcels of the communal lands, stipulating that they had to leave the parcels if they came into conflict with the community. The villages also regulated the use of streams and rivers, limiting tanning, dyeing and other activities that could pollute the water. Hydro-energy of the swift rivers was also utilized: the Ottoman traveller, Evliya Çelebi, noticed hundreds of sawmills in Székelyudvarhely. The mineral waters of Székely Land were famous in the whole principality.\n\nGabriel Bethlen was the first prince to realize that the decrease of the number of free Székelys threatened the military potential of Transylvania. He prohibited the Székelys to choose serfdom, ordered the redemption of hundreds of serfs and abolished the Székely serfs' tax exemption. The latter measure persuaded many serfs to leave Székely Land. The redemption of Székely serfs continued during the reign of George I Rákóczi, who also granted parcels of land to the liberated Székelys. Rákóczi renounced the royal prerogarive of seizing and granting landed property in Székely Land in 1636. Since the Sabbatarians supported Rákóczi's opponent, Moses Székely, the Diet ordered them to convert to one of the four official religions in 1638. All who continued to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday and failed to baptize their children were imprisoned. Small Sabbatarian communities survived in the villages.\n\nGeorge II Rákóczi broke into Poland without the sultan's authorization in 1656, provoking the invasion of Transylvania by the Ottomans. After István Petki, Captain General of Csíkszék, did not accept the sultan's offer to claim the princely throne for himself, the Crimean Tatars pillaged Székely Land in 1661. Michael I Apafi, who was elected prince at the Ottomans' order, recruited Székelys to defend his palace and fortresses. He joined the Holye League against the Ottomans, recognizing that Transylvania was a land of the Holy Crown of Hungary in 1686.\n\nThe army of Emperor Leopold I occupied Transylvania in late 1687. He restored civil government in 1690, by issuing the \"Diploma Leopoldinum\" which confirmed the privileges of the Three Nations. However, five years later, the imperial army again occupied the principality. The new government increased the taxes and strengthened the position of the Roman Catholic Church, which stirred up discontent. The increase of the taxes especially aggrieved the Székely villages, but the commander of the imperial army, Jean-Louis Rabutin de Bussy, suppressed all riots, imprisoning many Székelys.\n\nFrancis II Rákóczi (a descendant of the Rákóczi princes of Transylvania) became the leader of the opposition against Leopold. After taking control of Upper Hungary (now Slovakia) and large territories to the east of the Tisza in autumn 1703, he sent letters to the Three Nations (and also to the Romanians), urging them to support his war for independence. The Székelys of Háromszék and Csíkszék were among the first to join him. Rákóczi's supporters took control of Székely Land by early 1704.\n\nThe Diet proclaimed Rákóczi prince, but he could not enter Transylvania after the imperial army defeated his supporters in the Battle of Zsibó on 11 November 1705. Székely Land was put under military administration and hundreds of Székelys left the principality. The authorities limited free movement and began collecting all weapons. The Székely soldiers returned under the command of Lőrinc Pekry in summer 1706. Rákóczi, who was again elected prince, confirmed the Székelys' privileges in 1707.\n\nLeopold's successor, Joseph I, promised a general amnesty to those who would capitulate. After Rákóczi left Hungary for Poland to seek assistance, the representatives of the rebels signed the Treaty of Szatmár in 1711, acknowledging the rule of the Habsburgs. The Székely Kelemen Mikes was one of the few noblemen who followed Rákóczi into exile. Mikes's \"Letters from Turkey\" demonstrate both his education in France and his Transylvanian heritage.\n\nThe integration of Transylvania into the Habsburg Empire accelerated after the Treaty of Szatmár. The Gubernium (which was composed of 12 members appointed by the monarchs) became the supreme body of administration, but the most important decisions were made in Vienna. The Diet enacted the decisions of the Gubernium without opposition. The command of the imperial and local troops was unified in 1713. Appeals against the decisions of the seat courts were heard at the Royal Table. Since the monarchs supported the ideas of Counter-Reformation, many Székely noble families converted to Catholicism. The Unitarians and Sabbatarians were especially exposed to persecution in the 1720s. The Diet was last summoned in 1761.\n\nAround 20% of the Transylvanian population perished because of a plague between 1717 and 1720. Migration of serfs to Moldavia and Wallachia continued, but most migrants returned to Transylvania. The Székely commoners and \"primipili\" made attempts to regain their tax exempt status, but their movements were suppressed. Their largest rebellion broke out after Adolf Nikolaus Buccow, the military commander, decided to introduce the system of the Military Frontier in Székely Land in 1762, without consulting with the Diet or the seats.\n\nBuccow ordered the conscription of the commoners and \"primipili\" to set up new border guard troops, appointing German officers to complete the task. Referring to their traditional privileges, most Székelys declared that they would only serve under the command of their own officers. However, some commoners were ready to accept the new system and the imperial officials also promised freedom to the serfs who joined the new army. They turned against those who resisted, attacking their houses and villages.\n\nQueen Maria Theresa appointed a new official, József Siskovics, to complete the organization of the Military Frontier. Siskovics sent 10-20 soldiers to each villages, declaring that he would confiscated the landed property of those who resisted. Most Székelys in Gyergyó yielded, but the men from Madéfalva (now Siculeni in Romania) and the nearby villages fled to the mountains. After Siskovics ordered the expulsion of their wives and children from their houses, more than 2,700 armed Székelys came to Madéfalva from Háromszék and Csíkszék. The imperial army attacked the village, slaughtering more than 200 Székelys on 7 January 1764.\n\nThe \"Siculicidium\" (or Massacre of Székelys) at Madéfalva broke the Székelys' resistance. The organization of the Székely border guard was completed before the end of March. Two infantry regiments were set up in Csíkszék and Háromszék, and one \"hussar\" regiment in Csíkszék, Háromszék and Aranyosszék. Romanian peasants from Aranyosszék made up more than a fifth of the \"hussar\" regiment. Thousands of Székelys fled to Moldavia instead of joining the army.\n\nMaria Theresa declared Transylvania to be a grand principality on 2 November 1765. The partial integration of Székely Land in the Military Frontier divided the society into a military and a civil part. In the Military Frontier, most commoners and \"primipili\" joined the regiments. In addition to the defence of the frontier, the border guards were obliged to chase robbers and smugglers. The military commanders supervised the election of the magistrates, which diminished the autonomy of the Székely villages. Many aspects of everyday life were also controlled by the officers: the border guards could only marry with the consent of their commanders and the officers were authorized to ban smoking and dancing.\n\nMore than 44% of the inhabitants of Székely Land were commoners and \"primipili\" in the late 1760s, but the ratio of serfs and landless cotters exceeded 38%. The settlement of Romanian peasants in Csíkszék, Háromszék and Aranyosszék contributed to the increase of their number. Romani (or Gypsy) cotters were also mentioned in the 1760s. Many of them were employed as blacksmiths and musicians in the noblemen's manors. To regulate the obligations of the peasantry, the Gubernium issued a decree (the so-called \"Certain Points\") in 1769, prescribing that they were to work four or three days a week on the estates of the noblemen. Nevertheless, the peasants in Székely Land enjoyed more freedom than the serfs in the counties. For instance, Székely serfs run taverns and butcheries together with the noblemen, while it was the noblemen's monopoly in the counties.\n\nThe ideas of Enlightenment spread in Transylvania from the 1770s. The polymath József Benkő (who was a Calvinist priest) wrote a trilingual botanical dictionary and a manual of caves. He also promoted tobaccoo growing and the use of sumac in the leather industry.\n\nMaria Theresa's son and successor, Joseph II, wanted to transform the Habsburg Empire into a unitary state. He abolished the seats and divided Transylvania into eleven counties in 1784. He made German the official language of the central government and the towns. The representatives of the noblemen and the Székelys wrote a joint memorandum to perusade him to withdraw his reforms in 1787, but he revoked most of his decrees only on his deathbed in 1790. At the Diet that Joseph's successor, Leopold II, convoked in December 1790, the Székely György Aranka proposed the establishment of the Transylvanian Hungarian Philological Society. On the other hand, the Székely delegates did not support the proposed union of Transylvania with Hungary, because they feared that it would jeopardize their traditional liberties.\n\nTransylvanian culture flourished in the early 19th century. Farkas Bolyai improved the teaching of natural sciences at the college of Marosvásárhely. Sándor Kőrösi Csoma, who left Székely Land for Central Asia to search for the Hungarians' ancient homeland, compiled the first Tibetan-English dictionary. Sándor Farkas Bölöni published a book about his journeys in England and the United States, describing the latter as the country of \"common sense\". Székely noblemen and scholars who adopted the ideas of Liberalism demanded the unification of Hungary and Transylvania. However, Conservative noblemen headed the seats.\n\nA group of young artists and scholars published the reform program of the radical delegates of the Diet of Hungary without official authorization in Buda (the capital of Hungary) on 15 March 1848. Six days later the radical burghers and students of Kolozsvár accepted a similar program, in which they also demanded a remedy to the grievances of the Székely people. Before long, the assemblies of the Székely seats replaced the Conservative royal judges with Liberal politicians.\n\nThe Diet of Transylvania, which was dominated by ethnic Hungarian delegates, voted for the union of Transylvania and Hungary on 30 May. The Diet also abolished serfdom on 6 June. The new law secured a plot of land even for the cotters, with the exception of those who had settled in a \"Székey inheritance\", because the division of the properties of free Székelys would have created thousands of smallholders living below the level of subsistence. The population of Székely Land had doubled between 1767 and 1846, but the territory of arable lands could not be increased. Zsigmond Perényi (whom the Diet of Hungary appointed to study the problem) proposed that the landless Székely peasants should be settled in Banat.\n\nLajos Batthyány, Prime Minister of Hungary, urged the Székelys to take up arms for the revolutionary government. Before long, three Székely battalions joined the Hungarian army and fought against Josip Jelačić, Ban of Croatia, who had turned against the Hungarian government. The government dissolved the Military Frontier to abolish the authority of the imperial officials over the Székely regiments. Most Romanians and Saxons, who opposed the union of Transylvania and Hungary, sided with the royal court, which caused a civil war. Before long, hundreds of Hungarians were massacred in the counties.\n\nBatthyány's commissioner, László Berzenczey convoked the general assembly of the Székelys to Agyagfalva, threatening those who would not attend with capital punishment in accordance with customary law. On 18 October, the assembly declared that all Székelys were equal before the law. An army of 30,000 strong was set up. The Székely troops pillaged the Saxon town of Szászrégen (now Reghin in Romania), but the canons of the imperial army forced them to flee from the battlefield at Marosvásárhely. Before long, imperial troops occupied Marosszék and Udvarhelyszék, but the Székelys of Háromszék resisted till the end of 1848, preventing General Anton Puchner from assisting the imperial army in Hungary. The dozens of canons that Áron Gábor (a former artillery officer) produced during the fights contributed to the success of the resistance.\n\nBy the end of 1848 - beginning of 1849, Székelys joined the army set up by General Józef Bem and took part in his successful campaigns driving out Habsburg troops from Transylvania. The successful campaign was finally crushed when the imperial Russian army intervened in Transylvania following a request from the Habsburg Empire.\n\nIn 1867, an agreement (Compromise) was made between Austria and Hungary about the creation of the Dual Monarchy. According to the Compromise, Transylvania was united with the Kingdom of Hungary. A decade later, a new county system was introduced in the Kingdom, which put an end to the long tradition of Székely Seats.\n\n"}

MacLeod finally convinces Dawson he is telling the truth. Dawson and his niece Lynn confront Horton, who is finally injured by MacLeod. Dawson and the Watchers disappear from the bookshop.\n\nIn \"\" (1993), Dawson asks MacLeod to stop Immortal Quenten Barnes. MacLeod agrees because Barnes is threatening his friend Michael Moore. No one realizes that Barnes and Moore are the same person. Conversely, when MacLeod asks him to break the rules of the Watchers to get information, Dawson hesitates before accepting.\n\nIn \"\" (1993), Dawson asks MacLeod for help again, to check if the leader of the Zone is Immortal but tells him, \"Be careful around Canaan, alright ? I would hate to lose another friend\", to which MacLeod retorts, \"Since when did we become friends ?\" When MacLeod tells Dawson Canaan is not immortal, but he still wants more help from Dawson to stop him, MacLeod tells, \"There are people that watch and there are people that do.\"\n\nIn \"\" (1994), Dawson mentions bird-watching is a \"lot less dangerous than keeping an eye on [MacLeod]\" and adds, \"You know, maybe we should both stick to watching the birds, MacLeod. That'd be much safer all around.\"\n\nIn \"\" (1994), Dawson tells MacLeod two Immortals have been shot by mortals and then beheaded by an Immortal and adds, \"You watch yourself, MacLeod.\" When Dawson learns that the mysterious Immortal is Xavier St. Cloud, he decides to help MacLeod despite MacLeod's warnings. Dawson introduces MacLeod to Barton, Xavier's Watcher, ignoring that Barton is a renegade Watcher helping Xavier and James Horton to behead Immortals. After Horton shots Charlie DeSalvo, Dawson pretends not to know that Horton is still alive. MacLeod meets Horton in the Dawson family crypt and Horton hints that Dawson knew he was alive. MacLeod follows Dawson to a wharf when Dawson meets Horton and see them together. Later, Dawson tells MacLeod, \"After you fought with Horton, I had to take him to the hospital. He was dying. (…) He surprised us all. But I made sure he was through with the Watchers, MacLeod.\" When MacLeod angrily asks why Dawson failed to tell him this, Dawson answers, \"Because I knew you'd kill him. (…) I've known the man for twenty-five years, he's my sister's husband. I couldn't just let him die. (…) I didn't even know he was here, until you said you saw him... I had to find out why he came back.\" When MacLeod angrily asks what Dawson would have done if he had known what Horton was really doing, Dawson cannot answer. MacLeod is hurt by this breach of trust and answers, \"Next time I see you will be the last.\"\n\nIn \"\" (1994), Dawson tries to regain MacLeod's trust by giving him the address of Xavier and Horton's hiding, telling him, \"What's done is done, MacLeod. I can't take it back. (…) Maybe we weren't friends, but we did trust one another once, based on nothing more than a feeling. I just hope you can trust me now. (…) Whether you believe me or not is up to you. But it's the truth.\" MacLeod actually finds Xavier and Horton where Dawson told him they were. Later in Paris, Dawson finds Horton as Horton is about to flee in a boat and aims a gun at him. Despite Horton's claim that \"we're family,\" Dawson shoots him. When MacLeod hears the sound of the shot and joins him, Dawson tells him, \"We make mistakes... we clean them up.\" The script remarks, \"A debt has been repaid.\"\n\nIn \"\" (1994), Dawson meets MacLeod and Richie to warn them that Horton might have resurfaced. After MacLeod meets Lisa Milon, a perfect lookalike of his deceased lover Tessa sent by Horton, Richie turns to Dawson for help. Dawson agrees to investigate Lisa. As Horton tries to shoot Dawson, Richie throws himself in front of Dawson and saves his life. Dawson finds extraordinary to witness Richie's death and revival and asks him what it is like to come back. Then he tells Richie, \"I owe you one.\" Later, Dawson prevents Horton from shooting MacLeod in the cemetery where Tessa is buried. After MacLeod kills Horton, Dawson says he will take care of the body.\n\nDawson eventually opens his own jazz club and bar called Joe's where Dawson himself and several bands perform. Music, indeed jazz music, is a love of Joe's as he is seen performing songs in a few instances. The bar, apart from providing Dawson with an income also acted as a cover for his activities with the Watchers. The bar also acts as a meeting place for other Watchers who may be in the area as Dawson is seen hosting a card game in the bar with other Watchers in attendance. The extent to which the staff of the bar know about the Watchers in never disclosed.\n\nJoe Dawson served in the United States Marine Corps in Vietnam under Immortal Andrew Cord. In 1968, after seeing Cord shot, Dawson accidentally stepped on a landmine, blowing him up. He was saved by the resurrected Cord, who carried him on his back the sixteen miles to the nearest field hospital. There he tried to tell the psychiatrist that it had been Cord who had saved him, but was told that Cord was dead. Later, he was told that he had his legs amputated.\n\nNot being able to cope with the loss of his legs, he tried to commit suicide by shooting himself. Before he was able to do that, he was visited by a Watcher named Ian Bancroft, who told him about immortality. Dawson found a new meaning to his life and became a Watcher, owing it, in his perspective, to Andrew Cord. Bancroft would become Dawson's mentor within the Watchers and a close friend. That year, he begun his Watcher career as an historian. He later became a field Watcher, observing Immortals like Roy Ferrer (1971–1974) and Liza Grant (1975–1978), later being assigned to Duncan MacLeod in 1979.\n\nThe Watcher oath states that they can only observe and record, but never interfere. Because of the developing friendship between Duncan MacLeod and Dawson, he has been forced to break that oath, almost leading to his execution by his fellow Watchers. Dawson, himself, is shown to be conflicted about breaching his oath; especially during the beginning of his friendship with Duncan. Over the long term however, Dawson forms a strong friendship with Duncan which brings him into conflict with his fellow Watchers. Dawson uses his access to Watcher resources to assist Duncan on several occasions. Dawson, even came to Amanda's aid when she asked for his help when she worked with Nick Wolfe; demonstrating that he had a certain affection for her. The Watchers expel Dawson from the organization for a brief period following the revelations about his breaking his Watcher's oath and the subsequent events. At Duncan's insistence, however, Dawson apparently used his contacts in the organization to be able to re-enter it.\n\nDawson met his untimely demise in \"\", trying to rescue immortal Reggie Weller from the Guardian, who responded by running him through with the shattered blade of Duncan MacLeod's sword. However, the events of \"The Source\" have been acknowledged by the actors and Series head writer David Abramowitz as having been nothing more than a bad dream, and are not part of the overall continuity.\n\nIt is revealed in the 2008 short film \"Highlander: Reunion\", said to take place a decade after the end of Series, that Dawson has begrudgingly been retired from the Watchers, just shy of 40 years of service. Dawson tells his long-time friend and former Watcher Methos that a new, 28-year-old Watcher has been assigned to Duncan MacLeod. His replacement is a Princeton University graduate and member of Phi Beta Kappa and is not physically handicapped as he is.\n\nByrnes says of his character, \"Joe's been through the wringer. (…) It would be hard for people to be around him too much, I think. He's kind of a loner, because at some point he's got to have some serious demons. These people have witnessed this crazy stuff; how do you deal with it ? It's hard to be ordinary. Joe is extra ordinary [sic], he's really ordinary. I mean that in a good way.\"\n\nThe script of \"The Watchers\" describes Dawson as a middle-aged or older man called Ian Dawson, saying, \"There is a sense of power and mystery behind the man's scholarly appearance.\" Actor Jim Byrnes precises, \"he was either North American or English, somewhere between forty and sixty. (…) Immediately, I said, 'No, I'm not an Ian.' So we changed the name to Joe.\" Byrnes was hired on a tight schedule and says, \"Originally, I knew I was doing this one episode [\"The Watchers\"] where we were going to introduce the character and then we were going to take it from there. And they promised me \"x\" number more episodes just to kind of sweeten the pot to get me to do the show on short notice.\"\n\nAccording to Executive Producer Bill Panzer and Creative Consultant David Abramowitz, actors Michael York and David McCallum wanted to play the part. They were looked at because initially Joe was meant as a character \"more studious, [with a] much tighter personality\" than he eventually became. Abramovitz says, \"In the beginning with Joe, the Dawson we wrote was a totally different character and it didn't work as well as it could.\" Byrnes was finally chosen because, according to Abramowitz, he had \"a certain quality that was just more real, more earthly than the other two (…) he had his own trials to live through his life, being handicapped, and he was a wonderful actor, but more than an actor he's got presence on a screen.\" Abramowitz adds, \"He's a human guy, he's a real mensch, Jim. There are no illusions. There is strength but not a tremendous amount of vanity.\" Bill Panzer says, \"he was a real mensch.\"\n\nDawson's function as a character is mostly one of exposition. Byrnes says, \"So many times, it's the nature of the game, I end up saying, 'Well, you know, in 1865 they found this guy' and just do exposition. You got to tell the story some way. You're like the narrator because of the nature of the show; it's not about me.\" Dawson also had to face conflicts of his own. Abramowitz thinks, \"Look at the stories that Joe opened up because of the character of Joe and the conflicts that Joe faces. And coming to terms with being somewhat of a hypocrite, which is, 'We observe; we don't act.' And then you see Joe act. Which happens because he is human and because it's a classic case of 'Do what I say, not what I do.' And that's the way life is and that's the way people are. (…) So, those things are always very difficult, and those are the things that he plays with. In \"Indiscretions\", it is Joe and Methos, and the issue of interference comes to the fore.\"\n\nIn \"The Watchers\", Dawson is working in a bookstore the script of the episode describes as \"like Book Soup in Los Angeles, cluttered\". Later, Dawson moves from the bookstore to the blues bar. Abramowitz explains, \"Jim Byrnes as a bookstore owner just doesn't make it for me. The best thing we ever did was, later on, move him into the bar, which is where he lives and where his soul plays.\" Abramowitz says, \"We came up with the idea of the blues bar, which was a perfect place for him and gave us opportunities to hear his music.\" Byrnes says, \"I wanted to get into a milieu that I enjoyed and that Joe enjoyed, just as the character. And it happened because everybody has discovered that it doesn't just say on my résumé that I'm a professional singer and guitarist. I actually am. Everybody came out to hear the band play and then thought, 'How can we incorporate this into the show ?' And we found a way and it's been great. It really helps you as an actor because it broadens Joe's scope immediately. It gives him a wider palette.\" Byrnes thinks, \"Music is Joe's form of meditation, where he would go; it's Joe's martial art.\" Some of Byrnes's music compositions were used in \"Archangel\" and \"Avatar\". Another song by Byrnes, \"Jack of Diamonds\", was used in \"Run For Your Life\". Panzer recollects, \"That song was so cool that we lengthened the scene fifty percent, because we wanted to hear more of his music as the whole thing works so wonderfully together.\" Panzer further adds, \"That was the first time he ever sang on the show, and was kind of the trigger that led us to build Joe's place so that we could showcase his blues singing and his playing.\" Associate Creative Consultant Donna Lettow says, \"For \"The Cross of St. Antoine\", we had just built Joe's a couple of episodes before, and a memo had gone out, saying, 'Use Joe's; we love it, it's beautiful, and we spent a lot of money on it.'\" Lettow further recalls how they arranged a breakaway window for Dawson, who in this episode tries to rescue his girlfriend. The window broke on its way to the set and Byrnes is actually trying to break a tempered window with his cane. Eventually one of the grips painted a crowbar to match Byrnes' cane and Byrnes managed to break the window. Lettow also recalls, \"There's an episode, \"Indiscretions\", where we find out that Joe has a daughter, Amy Brennan. And in the version that we sent to the set, she never knows. It's an affair Joe had in his Watcher Academy days, and he and the girl's mother decided it was best, as Joe says, 'To ruin one life instead of four.' And [Director] Dennis Berry called after the script went up and said, 'Don't you think a fiery scene between Joe and Amy about it and then Amy gets kidnapped? Now Joe has unfinished business. They've had a fight; he really has to get her back. Wouldn't that be dramatically better?' And indeed, in this case, it was, and we went ahead and made the changes. \"Indiscretions\" is all about things that Joe and Methos did in their past that have come back to haunt them. (…) Methos has a longer track record, of course. But at the heart, I think they're very similar.\"\n\nDawson has a complicated relationship with Duncan MacLeod. Executive Producer Bill Panzer says about \"Turnabout\", \"this episode was the beginning of the relationship, well the expansion of the relationship between Joe Dawson and Duncan MacLeod. For Joe to help MacLeod by getting him a file, was for him a very big step in what became a major character arc as the two of them grew closer and closer.\" Abramowitz thinks of \"Unholy Alliance\", \"It created tension between Joe Dawson and Mac, which was a very good thing, so that Joe just wasn't a sidekick, wasn't a helper, that he had his own agenda, that he had his own view of the world, and it really solidified in some ways what the perspective of the Watchers were.\" Panzer further says that Dawson \"was (…) the first Watcher, that we know of who (…) started step over the line a little bit. There was that separation between the Watchers and the Immortals, and he didn't just observe, didn't just record, but occasionally chose a side, (…) started to help.\" Abramowitz further observes, \"I think that Joe believes that there is something singular and special about Duncan MacLeod, that there may be a destiny MacLeod has to fulfill, which is even greater than the Watchers'. (…) Why in our universe does Joe think Duncan is special ? Because he has seen signs, \"Avatar\", \"Armageddon\", \"Something Wicked\", \"Deliverance\", \"Prophecy\", that separate MacLeod from everyone else, that there is a prophecy that MacLeod is the anointed one. We hint at it, and obviously Joe feels this, plus he feels a tremendous admiration for MacLeod. He loves Duncan MacLeod. This is as deep as one man can feel for another. And I think it's returned.\"\n\nTynan thinks of the relationship between Dawson and James Horton, \"Horton would not die. Of course, his brother-in-law, Joe Dawson, was the shakiest gun in the West. He seemed to not be able to hit the guy in any part of the body that would actually kill him. Horton kept surviving.\"\n\nThe audience reaction was favorable. Abramowitz recalls, \"he was one of the fans' favorites all over the years that we made the show.\" He explains, \"the audience actually took part, they could identify with the Watchers. (…) It's hard to identify with someone who is Immortal. Sometimes they live for eight hundred or a thousand or five hundred years, but a Watcher's just a normal human being. And so the audience could find themselves thinking, 'I could be that guy'. And I think Joe became every man of the show. He became the audience in a big way.\" Byrnes says similarly, \"I think [the Watchers are] part of the reason that the character caught on. We are all Watchers, everybody that's a fan of the show. We are all members of the same organization, so I think that puts me, an ordinary guy, in extraordinary circumstances, and that gives everybody something to hang on to. I think that's why the character has worked. We all get older and have our aches and pains and we look different every day, you know, a couple extra miles, so it gives that sense of continuity. I just put everybody, all the viewers, I think, a little bit closer to the picture. Because they see me, and some days I don't look so hot and some days I look all right. It's the human element. Joe's just an ordinary person witnessing extraordinary events.\" Executive Script Consultant David Tynan says, \"I like writing for Jim Byrnes. Joe Dawson is an interesting character because he is human. While MacLeod is human in many ways, he's Immortal. Joe is a human like I am or like you are or anyone else is. So he's very accessible.\" Abramowitz thinks, \"Jim's soul plays through Joe Dawson.\" Byrnes says of his work, \"I had a good rapport with the crew, with Adrian [Paul], with the writers, the producers, etcetera. Obviously, I didn't get in the way, and what I did didn't hurt anybody. And people seemed to enjoy the character, so it's continued.\"\n\nIn \"Brother in Arms\" Dawson is seen losing his legs and in \"Armageddon\" Dawson is tempted into having his legs again. Executive Script Consultant David Tynan says, \"There have been a couple of shows where Jim, the actor, has had to deal with Joe, the character, facing the loss of his legs. [\"Brother in Arms\"] In the scene where Joe wakes up to find his legs gone, I had to ask Jim what it was like. Jim said, 'Well, the fact is you don't wake up and scream in terror, you wake up and go \"Whoa\", and fall back to sleep, because you're so shot up with morphine, you have no idea what they're telling you.' So we adjusted the script accordingly. And certainly we were very concerned how Jim would feel, as we would be concerned about how any actor would feel about something that approached his personal life in such a way. And Jim was okay with it. I think that's a tribute to him as an actor and as a person, that he's not afraid to explore those areas. Or they are areas that he has in some part explored and he's not afraid to put on the screen. The temptation scene in \"Armageddon\" was a very unusual scene. It's hard to watch in some way, probably hard to do.\" Abramowitz says, \"I loved \"Armageddon\" because Jim Byrnes gave an incredible performance, which was heartbreaking.\" He says further, \"I called him before and I said, 'Jim, how do you feel about this?' Because I would never do anything that would make him uncomfortable as a human being. But he was actually excited to do it. He was really into it, up for it, going for it. He's come to terms with his life and who he is. (…) Joe is pretty much the human factor, but he's the heroic human factor.\" Associate Creative Consultant Gillian Horvath says, \"It's big stuff for him. It's issues from his own life, but it's not about him; it's about Joe, but they obviously share some certain traits. That he's willing to bare his own life, his own feelings, in order to give Joe something that strong. That he cares enough about the character to say, 'Yeah, let's give him this big scene and in order to do it I will use myself, part of me will be offered up.'\" Lettow recalls that when the producers viewed the dailies of Armageddon, in which Ahriman looking like James Horton offers his legs to Dawson, there was \"not a dry eye in the room. And we watched those over and over and just marveled at Jim Byrnes' ability. And sat here saying, 'Oh my God, what have we done to him?'\"\n\n"}
{"id": "144952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144952", "title": "John Bale", "text": "John Bale\n\nJohn Bale (21 November 1495 – November 1563) was an English churchman, historian and controversialist, and Bishop of Ossory. He wrote the oldest known historical verse drama in English (on the subject of King John), and developed and published a very extensive list of the works of British authors down to his own time, just as the monastic libraries were being dispersed. His unhappy disposition and habit of quarrelling earned him the nickname \"bilious Bale\".\n\nHe was born at Cove, near Dunwich in Suffolk. At the age of twelve he joined the Carmelite friars at Norwich, removing later to the house of \"Holme\", (possibly the Carmelite priory at Hulne near Alnwick). Later he entered Jesus College, Cambridge, and took his degree of B.D. in 1529.\n\nHe became the last Prior of the Ipswich Carmelite house, elected in 1533. He abandoned his monastic vocation, and got married, saying, \"that I might never more serve so execrable a beast, I took to wife the faithful Dorothy.\" He obtained the living of Thorndon, Suffolk, but in 1534 was summoned before the Archbishop of York for a sermon against the invocation of saints preached at Doncaster, and afterwards before John Stokesley, Bishop of London, but he escaped through the powerful protection of Thomas Cromwell, whose notice he is said to have attracted by his miracle plays.\n\nIn these plays Bale denounced the monastic system and its supporters in unrestrained language and coarse imagery. The prayer of \"Infidelitas\" which opens the second act of his \"Three Laws\" is an example of his profane parody. These somewhat brutal productions were intended to impress popular feeling, and Cromwell found in him an invaluable instrument. When Cromwell fell from favour in 1540, Bale fled with his wife and children to Antwerp. He returned on the accession of King Edward VI, and received the living of Bishopstoke, Hampshire, being promoted in 1552 to the Irish see of Ossory. He refused to be consecrated by the Roman Catholic rites of the Irish church, and won his point, though the Dean of Dublin made a protest against the revised office during the ceremony. He also quarrelled bitterly with the aged and respected judge Thomas St. Lawrence, who travelled to Kilkenny to urge the people to reject his innovations.\n\nWhen the accession of Queen Mary inaugurated a violent reaction in matters of religion, he was forced to get out of the country again. He tried to escape to Scotland, but on the voyage was captured by a Dutch man-of-war, which was driven by bad weather into St Ives, Cornwall. Bale was arrested on suspicion of treason, but soon released. At Dover he had another narrow escape, but he eventually made his way to the Netherlands and thence to Frankfurt and Basel. During his exile he devoted himself to writing. After his return, on the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, he received (1560) a prebendal stall at Canterbury, where he died and was buried in the cathedral.\n\nJohn Bale attacked his enemies with vehemence and scurrility, much of which was directed strongly and forcibly against the Roman Catholic Church and its writers: but this cavill does not significantly diminish the value of his contributions to literature. (The Roman Catholic sympathiser and antiquary Anthony Wood, a man of \"uncouth manners\" and a condemned libeller, described him as \"foul-mouthed Bale\" a century afterwards.) Of his mysteries and miracle plays only five have been preserved, but the titles of the others, quoted by himself in his \"Catalogus\", show that they were animated by the same political and religious aims. The \"Three Laws of Nature, Moses and Christ, corrupted by the Sodomytes, Pharisees and Papystes most wicked\" (produced in 1538 and again in 1562) was a morality play. The direction for the dressing of the parts is instructive: \"Let Idolatry be decked like an old witch, Sodomy like a monk of all sects, Ambition like a bishop, Covetousness like a Pharisee or spiritual lawyer, False Doctrine like a popish doctor, and Hypocrisy like a gray friar.\" \"A Tragedye; or enterlude manifesting the chief promyses of God unto Man\", \"The Temptacyon of our Lorde\", and \"A brefe Comedy or Enterlude of Johan Baptystes preachynge in the Wyldernesse, etc.\" were all written in 1538.\n\nBale is a figure of some literary-dramatic importance as the author of \"Kynge Johan\" (c.1538), which marks the transition between the old morality play and the English historical drama. It does not appear to have directly influenced the creators of the chronicle histories (such as \"The Troublesome Reign of King John\" (1591)), but it is remarkable that such a developed attempt at historical drama should have been made fourteen years before the production of \"Gorboduc\". \"Kynge Johan\" is itself a polemic against the Roman Catholic Church. King John is represented as the champion of English church rites against the Roman see.\n\nSome view Bale's most important work as being \"Illustrium majoris Britanniae scriptorum, hoc est, Angliae, Cambriae, ac Scotiae Summarium...\" (\"A Summary of the Famous Writers of Great Britain, that is, of England, Wales and Scotland\") published at Ipswich and Wesel for John Overton in 1548, and 1549. This contained authors through five centuries: however, another edition, almost entirely rewritten and containing fourteen centuries, was printed at Basel with the title \"Scriptorum illustrium majoris Britanniae...Catalogus\" (\"Catalogue of the Famous Writers of Great Britain\") in 1557–1559.\n\nThis chronological catalogue of British authors and their works was partly founded on the \"De uiris illustribus\" of John Leland. Bale was an indefatigable collector and worker, and personally examined many of the valuable libraries of the Augustinian and Carmelite houses before their dissolution. His work contains much information that would otherwise have been hopelessly lost. His autograph note-book is preserved in the Selden Collection of the Bodleian Library, Oxford. It contains the materials collected for his two published catalogues arranged alphabetically, without enlargement on them nor the personal remarks which colour the completed work. He includes the sources for his information. He noted: \"I have bene also at Norwyche, our second citye of name, and there all the library monuments are turned to the use of their grossers, candelmakers, sopesellers, and other worldly occupyers... As much have I saved there and in certen other places in Northfolke and Southfolke concerning the authors names and titles of their workes, as I could, and as much wold I have done throughout the whole realm, yf I had been able to have borne the charges, as I am not.\"\n\nJohn Bale's written works are listed in \"Athenae Cantabrigienses.\" While in Germany he published an attack on the monastic system entitled \"The Actes of Englysh Votaries\", three \"Lives\" as \"The Examinations of Lord Cobham, William Thorpe and Anne Askewe, &c\", and the \"Pageant of Popes\". While Rector of Bishopstoke he produced \"The Image of both Churches\", and after his stormy association with Ossory he printed an account of his 'Vocacyon' to that see. \"The Resurreccion of the Masse\", purporting to be written by one Hugh Hilarie, is generally attributed to Bale.\n\nJohn Pitts or Pitseus (1560–1616), an English Roman Catholic exile, founded on Bale's work his \"Relationum historicarum de rebus anglicis tomus primus\" (Paris, 1619), better known by its running title of \"De Illustribus Angliae scriptoribus\". This is really the fourth book of a more extensive work. He omits the Wycliffite and Protestant divines mentioned by Bale, and the most valuable section is the \"lives\" of the Roman Catholic exiles resident in Douai and other French towns. He asserts (\"Nota de Joanne Bale\") that Bale's \"Catalogus\" was a misrepresentation of John Leland's work, though in all likelihood he only knew Leland's work through his reading of Bale.\n\nThe Image of Both Churches was published by John Bale in 1547, and is a detailed commentary on the book of Revelation, the last book in the Christian Bible. Bale proceeded by taking short passages and following with a detailed paraphrase to explain the meaning and significance of such things as the opening of the seven seals, the first beast, the second beast with two horns, the blowing of the trumpets, and the going forth of the horsemen. Of central concern was the correct identification of Antichrist.\n\nBale’s central thesis is that the book of Revelation is a prophecy of how God’s word and those who love it (the “saints”) would fare at the hands of men and a false Church during the last age, meaning the time between the ascension of Jesus and the end of the world.\n\nBale identified two types of churches. First there was a false church, or Church of Antichrist, which persecutes those who do not bow to its dictates. He did not entirely limit his criticism to the Roman Church but, typical of the Puritans, accused also the young Church of England. By contrast, the \"true Church\" loves and teaches God's word truly. He also speaks critically of the Church of Mohammed (“Mahomet”): its tyranny over the people (the “Turks”) and persecution of the saints. \n\nHe is the central figure in the 1988, novel \"Books of Bale\" by the novelist and playwright John Arden.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2880937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2880937", "title": "Kalkadoon", "text": "Kalkadoon\n\nThe Kalkadoon (properly Kalkatungu) are descendants of an Indigenous Australian tribe living in the Mount Isa region of Queensland. Their forefather tribe has been called 'the elite of the Aboriginal warriors of Queensland'. In 1884 they were massacred at \"Battle Mountain\" by settlers and police.\n\nKalkatung belonged to the Kalkatungic branch of the Pama-Nyungan language family, the other being Yalarnnga which was spoken to its south in the area of Djarra, in Queensland. Kalkatungu was spoken around Mount Isa, Queensland. Nothing is known of a third language Wakabunga sometimes thought to have had a genetic relation to the other two.\n\nRemnants of the language collected from the last native speakers by Barry Blake allowed the rudiments of the grammar and the language to be reconstructed. According to Robert M. W. Dixon there is a 43% overlap in vocabulary existed with Yalarnnga but with a different grammar and only 10% percent of verbs cognate. Both have bounded pronouns or traces of them unlike all other languages in the surrounding areas suggesting they represented, until their extinction, a larger block of distinctive languages.\n\nLike many other Aboriginal societies, the Kalkatungu had a sign language. The idea of a large kangaroo, for example, was indicated by joining the tip of the forefinger to the thumb, with all other fingers remaining extended, while flicking the wrist forward (suggestive of the hopping motion). A land snake was indicated by pointing the forefinger, while rotating the wrist and extending one's arm outwards.\n\nThe Kalkatungu's traditional lands began at the heads of the Cloncurry river across the heads of the Leichhardt and Gregory Rivers, including the Barkly Tableland, the Selwyn ranges and extending south to the boundaries around Chatsworth, Mount Merlin and Buckingham Downs. To their east and north, were the Mayi-Thakurti (Mitakoodi) of the Cloncurry district, and next to the Maigudung tribe, according to Palmer.\n\nWalter Roth documented in some detail the intensity of indigenous trading passing through the Selwyn Range and Kalkatungu lands from Boulia to Cloncurry, which formed a transit point for exchanges everything from the native medical anaesthetic and narcotic stimulant, pituri, and ochre to stone knives and axes. Over 800,000 stone axe blanks remain strewn over the 2.4 sq.km metabasalt quarry at Lake Moondarra near Mt Isa, attesting to the intensity of aboriginal manufacturing for trade goods in this Kalkatungu area, some of the axes being traded as far away as 1,000 kilometres.\n\nThe Kalkatungu were an early transmission group for the diffusion of the \"Mudlunga\" (Molonga) ritual dance from the Georgina River. A photo exists of their men in full ceremonial raiment, dated 1895, prepared to perform their version of the dance that, within a few decades, would reach across Australia.\n\nExtensive rock art, with examples of anthropomorphic paintings, has been recorded in the Kalkatungu's Selwyn Range homeland.\n\nThe nearby Mayi-Thakurti tribe occasionally reported that the Kalkatungu were split into two major divisions, respectively the \"Muntaba\" (southern) and the \"Roongkari\"(western) peoples.\n\nFrederic Urquart who played a part as a trooper in a massacre of Kalkadoon warriors, recounted their myth regarding the origins of fire. It started with a thunderbolt that set the plains on fire, as the tribe were preparing to eat raw meat. The flames swept over the camp site, and the charred meat was found to be tastier. An old woman was sent to track the fire and fetch in back, and brought back a blazing stick. Charged with being the fire-keeper, she loyally watched over it for years, until a flood washed out the camp-fire. She was exiled until she could retrieve the secret of fire and, failing to do so, in rage rubbed two sticks together, and a flame kindled, and she won back entry to the tribe.\n\nThe first Europeans to visit the area were explorers Burke and Wills who crossed the Cloncurry River in 1861. Though their journals make no mention of the tribe, their passing through is said to have been recorded in Kalkatungu oral history, and in their language they coined the term \"walpala\" (from 'white feller') to denote Europeans. Three parties sent out to search for Burke and Wills, led respectively by John McKinlay, William Landsborough, and Frederick Walker passed through the general area, and Walker, former commander of the Dawson native police, shot 12 natives dead, while wounding several more, just to the north east of Kalkatungu territory.\n\nEdward Palmer, described by George Phillips as 'one of that brave band of pioneer squatters who in the early sixties swept across North Queensland with their flocks and herds, settling, as if by magic, great tracts of hitherto unoccupied country,' settled on the edge of Kalkatungu country in 1864, at Conobie, on the western bank of the Cloncurry River. Decades later, he described them as a peculiar people of which little was known. Palmer was critical of the use of native police, and interested in indigenous tribes. His station lands did not cover any Kalkatungu sacred sites, he did not object to their presence in the vicinity, and found no problem in his relations with the Kalkatungu. He tried to learn their language. Ernest Henry arrived in 1866, discovering, with the assistance of Kalkatungu guides, copper deposits the following year, and founded the Great Australia Mine. He successfully enlisted some Kalkatungu people to work one of these mines. A short attempt at settlement by W. and T. Brown at Bridgewater in 1874 experienced, like Palmer, no difficulties with the indigenous owners of the land.\n\nThe Scottish settler Alexander Kennedy then took up land in the area in 1877. He had managed, since his arrival in 1861, to accumulate land holdings of some 4,800 sq-miles, holding 60,000 cattle, and established himself in a residence he built, called \"Buckingham Downs.\" Kennedy is thought to have begun the troubles with the native peoples of the area by instigating murderous assaults on the Kalkatung. Iain Davidson describes him as 'the man who led the destruction of the tribes of North West Central Queensland.'\n\nThe traditional white heroic narrative version of what then occurred drew on the account provided by Sir Wilmot Hudson Fysh in 1933. According to this version, the Kalkatungu were by nature a hostile and bellicose tribe, exceptionally brave with 'primitive' military cunning and guerilla-like tactics of strategic withdrawals to the mountains to evade reprisals for their savagery, who were vanquished and broken after a last stand against men like Kennedy who triumphed heroically in pursuing the moral and economic progress of Queensland.\n\nIn December 1878, a settler called Molvo, with three of his men, were killed near Cloncurry, at the important Wonomo watering hole on Suleiman Creek near Cloncurry, as they camped with their herd. This was the starting point, in indigenous history, for Kennedy and other settlers in the district joining forces with native troops under Inspector Eglinton stationed at Boulia to war down the native tribes of the region. Subsequent to this incident, scores of Kalkatungu in the surrounding hills were shot down.\n\nOver the following years, the Kalkatungu gained a reputation among graziers for tactical wiliness both in resisting police and settler forays against them, and in harvesting the cattle game they found on their lands. Kennedy pulled strings in Brisbane to get reinforcements that might guarantee greater immunity for people and property in the area, and the first Queensland Commissioner of Police D. T. Seymour is said to have given Kennedy a blank cheque to war down the tribe and to have dispatched the aristocratic Marcus de la Poer Beresford, a nephew of the Marquess of Waterford, as new head of the Cloncurry native police unit to that end.\n\nOn 24 January 1883, Beresford camped with four of his troopers at in the McKinlay Range. After skirmishing with a group of Kalkatungu, they managed to corral a number, who appeared to give no resistance, into a gully nearby and post a guard over them for the night. Queensland historian Arthur Laurie suggests Beresford's error lay in 'stupidly treat(ing) them like cattle'. It is presumed that they had a stash of arms prepared for the occasion, and rose up, and killed Beresford and 3 of his men. One, though speared in his side, managed to escape and cover the distance, some 20 miles, to \"Farleigh\" station the following day. For a year, the Kalkatung managed to hold sway over their tribal lands, as both settlers and the police felt intimidated by their unbeaten territorial ascendancy. According to an anonymous person writing for the \"Queensland Figaro\", nonetheless, sometime towards the end of 1883, the native police 'willfully murdered eight blackfellows and several gins' in the area.\n\nIn March 1884, Sir Thomas McIlwraith sent Frederic Urquhart, a Sussex immigrant, employed in the Queensland Native Mounted Police Force to handle the crisis. The Kalkatungu are said to have directly challenged him to fight, via a messenger called \"Mahoni\". Urquhart, though based in Cloncurry, set up a forward camp 25 miles outside of the town, on the .\n\nUrquhart was galvanized into action in August on hearing from a native boy, \"Jackie\", who came in and reported that his employer James White Powell of Calton Hills, some 60 miles west of Cloncurry, at Mistake Creek, had been speared to death. Powell was a partner of Kennedy's, and the latter, together with Urquhart A.F. Mossman from White Hills station buried Powell, with Urqhart composing a poem vowing vengeance:\n\nThe group responsible was tracked down to a gorge, where they were feasting on the cattle, and most were mowed down. Over the next 9 weeks, settlers and Urquhart's police tracked the Kalkadoons relentlessly in a war of retaliation, killing many. In September, a Chinese shepherd from H.Hopkins's \"Granada Station\" on the was speared to death in the foothills of the Argylla Ranges, and it was rumoured he had been eaten by 'cannibals'. Soon afterwards, an estimated 600 Kalkatungu warriors gathered on a rocky outlook to fend off the parties of well-armed settlers, the local constabulary and native troopers. At one point the attackers under Urquhart tried a flanking movement, which caused the assembled aborigines to charge straight down on them, only to fall in waves under the withering fire of the muskets, called \"makini\" by the Kalkatungu. 200 are said to have died in this battle. Urqhart himself was knocked out, and this broke the back of organized resistance at a tribal level, and it was often touted that the Kalkatungu had been wiped out. The estimated numbers they lost over 6 years, from 1878 to 1884, in counter-attacking incursions and the exercise of expropriation over their lands, runs to 900.\n\nIn 1984 on the centenary of the massacre a plaque commemorating the Kalkatungu was unveiled by Charles Perkins and George Thorpe a Kalkatung elder, at the Kajabbi bush pub north of Cloncurry. It reads in part:\nThis obelisk is in memorial to the Kalkatungu tribes, who during September 1884 fought one of Australia's historic battles of resistance against a para-military force of European settlers and the Queensland native Mounted Police at a place known today as Battle Mountain - 20klms [sic] south west of Kajabbi.\n\nThe Kalkadoon have been commemorated in the name of the Kalkadoon grasswren, a bird with as small territorial range confined to the slopes of the Mt Isa region.\n\n\n\n"}

It was located at the confluence of the Saint Joseph, Saint Marys and Maumee rivers on the western edge of the Great Black Swamp in present-day Indiana. Over their respective decades of influence from colonial times to after the American Revolution and Northwest Indian Wars, the French, British and Americans all established trading posts and forts at the large village, as it was located on an important portage connecting Lake Erie to the Wabash and Mississippi rivers. The European-American town of Fort Wayne, Indiana started as a settlement around the American Fort Wayne stockade after the War of 1812.\n\nLong occupied by successive cultures of indigenous peoples, Kekionga was a large village of the Miami people at the time of European encounter. It became an important trading post for Europeans because it was on the six-mile portage between the Maumee and the Little rivers, which connected Lake Erie to the Wabash River and Mississippi River. Due to the mid-17th century French and Iroquois Wars over the fur trade, most traders believed the route was too dangerous. Following the wars, however, the portage proved to be the shortest route between the French colonies of New France (Canada) and La Louisiane. The area was full of wildlife as it had not been densely inhabited for years.\n\nThe Miami at first benefited from trade with the Europeans, who were primarily Canadiens from Quebec. Under Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, the Canadiens established a trading post and fort, first at the St. Joseph River, and later at Kekionga. Vincennes and the Miami developed a strong and enduring friendship.\n\nKekionga remained a central site for the Miami for several decades; their other villages were more temporary. The large meeting house hosted official tribal councils. However, a smallpox epidemic struck Kekionga in 1733 and people evacuated the village for a year. In a speech at the Treaty of Greenville (1795), Little Turtle called Kekionga \"that glorious gate ... through which all the good words of our chiefs had to pass from the north to the south, and from the east to the west.\" \nBritish merchants, seeking to expand their economic base, convinced some Miami to travel East for trade, in violation of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. In 1749, the pro-British La Demoiselle left Kekionga to establish the English trading village of Pickawillany, which grew rapidly. Fighting between pro-French and pro-British villages broke out among the Miami in 1751, as tensions rose in the region. French officials tried to persuade the Miami to return to Kekionga, which was nearer their stronghold of Detroit and harder for the British to reach. Lieutenant Louis Coulon de Villiers was sent to the dilapidated Fort Miamis and given authority to commandeer French voyageurs to construct a new fort, which was finished in 1752. In the same year, the pro-French chief Cold Foot died at Kekionga in another smallpox epidemic. When the French-allied Three Fires Confederacy destroyed Pickawillany, most of the surviving Miami returned to Kekionga, which stopped assisting the French.\n\nAfter the French and Indian War (1756-1763) ended with the French defeated, France ceded Canada to the British Empire. The Miami of Kekionga became involved in Pontiac's Rebellion in the spring of 1763, capturing the British garrison and killing the two ranking officers. The following year, Pacanne emerged as the village chief when he spared the life of the captive Captain Thomas Morris and returned him to Detroit. By 1765, Kekionga had accepted the British. Deputy commissioner George Croghan described Kekionga:\n\nThe Twightwee Village is situated on both Sides of a River called St. Joseph's ... The Indian Village Consists of about 40 or 50 Cabins besides nine or ten French Houses.\n\nIn 1780 during the American Revolutionary War, Kekionga was sacked by a force of French Americans led by Colonel Augustin de la Balme, who planned to take Detroit from the British. A Miami force led by Chief Little Turtle destroyed the French force. The Miami and the European-American traders of Kekionga remained economically tied to the British-held Fort Detroit, even after the British ceded all claims of the Northwest Territory to the new United States following the war in the Treaty of Paris (1783).\n\nIn 1790, the Canadian Governor Guy Carleton warned the government in London that the loss of Kekionga would result in grave economic hardships to Detroit. He estimated that Kekionga annually produced 2000 packs of pelts, worth about £24,000 sterling. This was twice the value of the next most important trade area, between Detroit and Lake Huron.\n\nDuring the winter of 1789/1790, the traders Henry Hay and John Kinzie stayed in Kekionga. Hay kept a daily journal, which recorded their regular routines of drinking, dancing, and parties, as well as weekly Mass. Hay played the flute and Kinzie played the fiddle, which made them popular with the inhabitants of Kekionga. Although Hay and Kinzie stayed primarily in the French-speaking village in Kekionga, they also described some of the Miami villages. They frequently talked with the chiefs Pacanne, Little Turtle, Blue Jacket, and Le Gris, as well as brothers James, George, and Simon Girty, who lived only three miles away.\nLater that year during the Northwest Indian Wars, the United States General Josiah Harmar led an invasion of Kekionga. His army counted seven distinct villages in the vicinity of Kekionga, known collectively as \"the Miami Towns\" or Miamitown. The collected villages of Kekionga had advance knowledge of the army, and most of the people evacuated the area, carrying as many of their food stores as possible. The traders took their trade goods to Fort Detroit, after giving out all their arms and ammunition to the Miami defenders. Major Ebenezer Denny, an officer with the US, drew a map of Kekionga in 1790, which showed a collection of eight distinct villages, surrounded by 500 acres of cornfields. The United States army burned some villages and food stores, but was forced to retreat after suffering high casualties in a series of battles with forces led by Little Turtle.\n\nThe Miami victories over General Harmar's army encouraged anti-U.S. sentiment in Kekionga, and Secretary of War Henry Knox decided that a United States fort needed to be built in the area. He ordered the territorial Governor Arthur St. Clair- who had recommended such a fort to Knox in 1790- to attack Kekionga and maintain a presence in the area. That campaign was intercepted long before they reached their destination in what became the Native Americans' greatest victory over United States forces.\n\nIn 1794, the American General Anthony Wayne led his well-trained Legion of the United States toward Kekionga, but turned and marched toward the British-held Fort Miami near modern-day Toledo, Ohio. Following General Wayne's victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, Kekionga's prominence began to diminish among the Miami. The Legion arrived at Kekionga on 17 September 1794, and Wayne personally selected the site for the new U.S. fort, which was named for him. It was finished by 17 October, and was capable of withstanding 24-pound cannons. Despite their objections, the Miami lost control of the long portage by the Treaty of Greenville (1795), since the Northwest Ordinance passed by Congress guaranteed free use of important portages in the region.\n\nAfter the construction of Fort Wayne, Kekionga's importance to the Miami slowly declined. The Miami village at the Forks of the Wabash (modern Huntington, Indiana) became more prominent. Despite the strong U.S. presence and loss of portage revenue, however, the Miami maintained sovereignty in Kekionga through the War of 1812. Under the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, they were forced to cede this and other central Indiana land in punishment for their not having supported the United States in the war. The site was redeveloped as the city of Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\nThe old name was used for one of the first professional baseball teams, the Fort Wayne Kekiongas. It also appears on Fort Wayne's city seal.\n\n\n"}

The missions were primarily run by Christian churches, whose religious teaching and western values greatly influenced day-to-day life for the communities. In New South Wales, there were two non-denominational Missions, the United Aborigines Mission (UAM) also called the Australian Aborigines' Mission (AAM) and the Australian Inland Mission (AIM).

It evolved from the so-called Protomierzanowice cultural unit. The name of the culture comes from an eponymous site in Mierzanowice, where the cemetery was located. This entity was part of the precarpathian sphere epicorded cultures and it has been divided into three local groups: samborzecka, iwanowicka and pleszowska. Initial phases of functioning of the mentioned culture are characterized by a small number of burials, seasonal settlements and single artifacts. The area of the Mierzanowice culture spread over from western Slovakia, through south - eastern Poland, reaching in the east the areas of the Volhynian Upland.\n\nBased on relative dating, Mierzanowice culture appeared in the Early Bronze Age. According to the archaeologist Jan Machnik, we distinguish the older and younger phase of this cultural unit. The discovery in Szarbia Zwierzyniecka allowed for a certain \"rejuvenation\" of the Mierzanowice culture as a result of the distinction of its late phase called \"szarbiańska\". The younger phase of the Mierzanowice culture was expended at the end of bronze A1 and the beginning of bronze A2 according to Paul Reinecke chronology. \n\nCemeteries of the Mierzanowice cultural population were established near the settlements. The largest cemeteries were from 150 to 300 burials. The burial occurred mainly in skeletal form. Human remains were put into oval or rectangular burial pits or in coffins made of wooden logs. There were two systems for arranging human corpses: in the shrunken position and in straight position. The bodies of men were buried on the right side while corpses of women on the left side. The results of investigations conducted at the cemeteries of the Mierzanowice culture, showed a little advantage of men's graves over women's graves, which had slightly poorer grave inventory. \n\nSettlements of the Mierzanowice culture in most cases are represented by small and seasonal camps. Settlements with a larger area were founded on the hills with a naturally defensive character, near water reservoirs. A relatively large part of the archaeological sites of this culture are found on loess uplands. The best – known settlement of the Mierzanowice culture is archaeological site called Iwanowice. In the classical phase of the Mierzanowice culture, the settlements were mostly accompanied by cemeteries. \n\nOne of the most common objects discovered in archaeological sites in the Mierzanowice culture are axes and sickles. Another type of artifacts are neklaces made of faience and bones. The Mierzanowice culture is well known for its earrings in the shape of a willow leaf, often produced in local workshops. Military objects discovered in the settlements are primarily arrowheads on the shape of leaves. The faience beads are an extremely common element of the funeral inventory. The next category is pottery. In vascular ceramics the influences of the Corded Ware culture are visible.

Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism and a central figure in the 20th-century American libertarian movement. He wrote over twenty books on political theory, revisionist history, economics and other subjects. Rothbard asserted that all services provided by the \"monopoly system of the corporate state\" could be provided more efficiently by the private sector and wrote that the state is \"the organization of robbery systematized and writ large\". He called fractional-reserve banking a form of fraud and opposed central banking. He categorically opposed all military, political and economic interventionism in the affairs of other nations. According to his protégé Hans-Hermann Hoppe, \"[t]here would be no anarcho-capitalist movement to speak of without Rothbard\".\n\nEconomist Jeffrey Herbener, who calls Rothbard his friend and \"intellectual mentor\", wrote that Rothbard received \"only ostracism\" from mainstream academia. Rothbard rejected mainstream economic methodologies and instead embraced the praxeology of his most important intellectual precursor, Ludwig von Mises. To promote his economic and political ideas, Rothbard joined Llewellyn H. \"Lew\" Rockwell, Jr. and Burton Blumert in 1982 to establish the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Alabama.\n\nRothbard's parents were David and Rae Rothbard, Jewish immigrants to the United States from Poland and Russia, respectively. David Rothbard was a chemist. Murray attended Birch Wathen, a private school in New York City. Rothbard later stated that he much preferred Birch Wathen to the \"debasing and egalitarian public school system\" he had previously attended in the Bronx.\n\nRothbard wrote of having grown up as a \"right-winger\" (adherent of the \"Old Right\") among friends and neighbors who were \"communists or fellow-travelers\". Rothbard characterized his immigrant father as an individualist who embraced the American values of minimal government, free enterprise, private property and \"a determination to rise by one's own merits [...] \"[A]ll socialism seemed to me monstrously coercive and abhorrent\".\nHe attended Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and eleven years later his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was due in part to conflict with his advisor Joseph Dorfman and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and that he was one of only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Rothbard became acquainted with Frank Chodorov and read widely in libertarian-oriented works by Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, Isabel Paterson, H. L. Mencken and others as well as Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises. In the early 1950s, when Mises was teaching at the Wall Street division of New York University Business School, Rothbard attended Mises' unofficial seminar. Rothbard was greatly influenced by Mises' book, \"Human Action\". Rothbard attracted the attention of the William Volker Fund, a group that provided financial backing to promote various right-wing ideologies in the 1950s and early 1960s. The Volker Fund paid Rothbard to write a textbook to explain \"Human Action\" in a form which could be used to introduce college undergraduates to Mises' views; a sample chapter he wrote on money and credit won Mises's approval. For ten years, Rothbard was paid a retainer by the Volker Fund, which designated him a \"senior analyst\". As Rothbard continued his work, he enlarged the project. The result was Rothbard's book \"Man, Economy, and State\", published in 1962. Upon its publication, Mises praised Rothbard's work effusively.\n\nIn 1953, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928–99) – whom he called Joey – in New York City. JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser as well as hostess of his Rothbard Salon. They enjoyed a loving marriage and Rothbard often called her \"the indispensable framework\" behind his life and achievements. According to Joey, patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage. The Volker Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966 at age 40. This institution had no economics department or economics majors and Rothbard derided its social science department as \"Marxist\". However, Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics.\n\nRothbard continued in this role for twenty years until 1986. Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman. According to Rothbard's friend, colleague and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a \"fringe existence\" in academia, but he was able to attract a large number of \"students and disciples\" through his writings, thereby becoming \"the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement\". Rothbard maintained his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the \"Journal of Libertarian Studies\" in 1977. In 1982, he co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995. The Institute's \"Review of Austrian Economics\", a heterodox economics journal later renamed the \"Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics\", was also founded by Rothbard in 1987.\nAfter Rothbard's death, Joey reflected on Rothbard's happiness and bright spirit, saying that \"he managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him\". She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Lew Rockwell: \"Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day\". Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of God, describing himself as a \"mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew\". Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, Rothbard was critical of the \"left-libertarian hostility to religion\". In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did. \"The New York Times\" obituary called Rothbard \"an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention\".\n\nIn 1954, Rothbard, along with several other attendees of Mises' seminar, joined the circle of novelist Ayn Rand, the founder of Objectivism. He soon parted from her, writing among other things that her ideas were not as original as she proclaimed, but similar to those of Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and Herbert Spencer. In 1958, after the publication of Rand's novel \"Atlas Shrugged\", Rothbard wrote a \"fan letter\" to her, calling the book \"an infinite treasure house\" and \"not merely the greatest novel ever written, [but] one of the very greatest books ever written, fiction or nonfiction\". He also wrote: \"[Y]ou introduced me to the whole field of natural rights and natural law philosophy\", prompting him to learn \"the glorious natural rights tradition\". Rothbard rejoined Rand's circle for a few months, but he soon broke with Rand once more over various differences, including his defense of anarchism.\n\nLater, Rothbard satirized Rand's acolytes in his unpublished one-act play \"Mozart Was a Red\" written as a farce and the essay \"The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult\". Rothbard characterized Rand's circle as a \"dogmatic, personality cult\". His play parodies Rand (through the character Carson Sand) and her friends and is set during a visit from Keith Hackley, a fan of Sand's novel \"The Brow of Zeus\" (a play on Rand's most famous novel, \"Atlas Shrugged\").\n\nRothbard died of a heart attack on January 7, 1995 at the age of 68. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Unionville, Virginia.\n\nRothbard was an advocate and practitioner of the Austrian School tradition of his teacher Ludwig von Mises. Like Mises, Rothbard rejected the application of the scientific method to economics and dismissed econometrics, empirical and statistical analysis and other tools of mainstream social science as useless for the study of economics. He instead embraced praxeology, the strictly \"a priori\" methodology of Mises. Praxeology conceives of economic laws as akin to geometric or mathematical axioms: fixed, unchanging, objective and discernible through logical reasoning without the use of any evidence. On the account of Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, eschewing the scientific method and empirical evidence distinguishes the Misesian approach \"from all other current economic schools\". Mark Skousen of Grantham University and the Foundation for Economic Education, a critic of mainstream economics, praises Rothbard as brilliant, his writing style persuasive, his economic arguments nuanced and logically rigorous and his Misesian methodology sound. However, citing Rothbard's absence of academic publications, Skousen concedes that Rothbard was effectively \"outside the discipline\" of mainstream economics and that his work \"fell on deaf ears\" outside his ideological circles. Paralleling Skousen's remarks, Hoppe laments the fact that all non-Misesian economists dismiss as \"dogmatic and unscientific\" the Misesian approach, which both he and Rothbard embraced.\n\nRothbard wrote extensively on Austrian business cycle theory and as part of this approach strongly opposed central banking, fiat money and fractional-reserve banking and advocated a gold standard and a 100% reserve requirement for banks.\n\nRothbard authored a series of scathing polemics against modern mainstream economics. He was critical of Adam Smith, calling him a \"shameless plagiarist\" who set economics off-track, ultimately leading to the rise of Marxism. Instead, Rothbard praised Smith's contemporaries' works, including Richard Cantillon, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot and Étienne Bonnot de Condillac for developing the subjective theory of value. In response to Rothbard's charge that Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\" was largely plagiarized, David D. Friedman castigated Rothbard's scholarship and character, saying that he \"was [either] deliberately dishonest or never really read the book he was criticizing\". Tony Endres called Rothbard's treatment of Adam Smith a \"travesty\".\n\nRothbard was equally scathing in his criticism of John Maynard Keynes, labeling Keynes weak on economic theory and a shallow political opportunist. Rothbard also wrote more generally that Keynesian-style governmental regulation of money and credit created a \"dismal monetary and banking situation\". He demeaned John Stuart Mill as a \"wooly man of mush\" and speculated that Mill's \"soft\" personality led his economic thought astray.\n\nRothbard was critical of monetarist economist Milton Friedman. In a polemic entitled \"Milton Friedman Unraveled\", he maligned Friedman as a \"statist\", a \"favorite of the establishment\", a friend of and \"apologist\" for Richard Nixon and a \"pernicious influence\" on public policy. Rothbard said that libertarians should scorn rather than celebrate Friedman's academic prestige and political influence. Noting that Rothbard has \"been nasty to me and my work\", Friedman responded to Rothbard's criticism by calling him a \"cult builder and a dogmatist\".\n\nIn a memorial volume published by the Mises Institute, Rothbard's protégé and libertarian theorist Hans-Hermann Hoppe wrote that the work \"Man, Economy, and State\" \"presented a blistering refutation of all variants of mathematical economics\" and included it among Rothbard's \"almost mind-boggling achievements\". Hoppe lamented that like his own mentor Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard died without winning the Nobel Prize that Hoppe says Rothbard deserved \"twice over\". Though Hoppe acknowledged that Rothbard and his work were largely ignored by academia, he called Rothbard an \"intellectual giant\" comparable to Aristotle, John Locke and Immanuel Kant.\n\nThough he self-identified as an Austrian economist, Rothbard's methodology was at odds with many other Austrians. In 1956, Rothbard deprecated the views of Austrian economist Fritz Machlup, stating that Machlup was no praxeologist and calling him instead a \"positivist\" who failed to represent the views of Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard stated that in fact Machlup shared the opposing positivist view associated with economist Milton Friedman. Mises and Machlup had been colleagues in 1920s Vienna before each relocated to the United States and Mises later urged his American protege Israel Kirzner to pursue his PhD studies with Machlup at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAccording to libertarian economists Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink, Rothbard wrote that the term evenly rotating economy (ERE) can be used to analyze complexity in a world of change. The words ERE had been introduced by Mises as an alternative nomenclature for the mainstream economic method of static equilibrium and general equilibrium analysis. Cowen and Fink found \"serious inconsistencies in both the nature of the ERE and its suggested uses\". With the sole exception of Rothbard, no other economist adopted Mises' term and the concept continued to be called \"equilibrium analysis\".\n\nIn a 2011 article critical of Rothbard's \"reflexive opposition\" to inflation, \"The Economist\" noted that his views are increasingly gaining influence among politicians and laypeople on the right. The article contrasted Rothbard's categorical rejection of inflationary policies with the monetary views of \"sophisticated Austrian-school monetary economists such as George Selgin and Larry White, [who] follow Hayek in treating stability of nominal spending as a monetary ideal—a position not all that different from Mr Sumner's\".\n\nAccording to economist Peter Boettke, Rothbard is better described as a property rights economist than as an Austrian economist. In 1988, Boettke noted that Rothbard \"vehemently attacked all of the books of the younger Austrians\".\n\nAlthough Rothbard adopted Ludwig von Mises' deductive methodology for his social theory and economics, he parted with Mises on the question of ethics. Specifically, he rejected Mises conviction that ethical values remain subjective and opposed utilitarianism in favor of principle-based, natural law reasoning. In defense of his free market views, Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments aimed at demonstrating that interventionist policies made all of society worse off. On the other hand, Rothbard concluded that interventionist policies do in fact benefit some people, including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs. Therefore, unlike Mises, Rothbard attempted to assert an objective, natural law basis for the free market. He called this principle \"self-ownership\", loosely basing the idea on the writings of John Locke and also borrowing concepts from classical liberalism and the anti-imperialism of the Old Right.\n\nRothbard accepted the labor theory of property, but rejected the Lockean proviso, arguing that if an individual mixes his labor with unowned land then he becomes the proper owner eternally and that after that time it is private property which may change hands only by trade or gift.\n\nRothbard was a strong critic of egalitarianism. The title essay of Rothbard's 1974 book \"Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays\" held: \"Equality is not in the natural order of things, and the crusade to make everyone equal in every respect (except before the law) is certain to have disastrous consequences\". In it, Rothbard wrote: \"At the heart of the egalitarian left is the pathological belief that there is no structure of reality; that all the world is a tabula rasa that can be changed at any moment in any desired direction by the mere exercise of human will\".\n\nVarious theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to \"anarcho-capitalism\". However, Rothbard was the first person to use the term as in the mid-20th century he synthesized elements from the Austrian School of economics, classical liberalism and 19th-century American individualist anarchists. According to Lew Rockwell, Rothbard is the \"conscience\" of all the various strains of libertarian anarchism, whose contemporary advocates are former \"colleagues\" of Rothbard personally inspired by his example.\n\nDuring his years at graduate school in the late 1940s, Rothbard considered whether a strict \"laissez-faire\" policy would require that private police agencies replace government protective services. He visited Baldy Harper, a founder of the Foundation for Economic Education, who doubted the need for any government whatsoever. During this period, Rothbard was influenced by 19th-century American individualist anarchists like Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker and the Belgian economist Gustave de Molinari who wrote about how such a system could work. Thus, he \"combined the \"laissez-faire\" economics of Mises with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state\" from individualist anarchists. In an unpublished memo written around 1949, Rothbard concluded that in order to believe in \"laissez-faire\" one must also embrace anarchism.\n\nRothbard began to consider himself a private property anarchist in 1950 and later began to use \"anarcho-capitalist\" to describe his political ideology. In his anarcho-capitalist model, a system of protection agencies compete in a free market and are voluntarily supported by consumers who choose to use their protective and judicial services. Anarcho-capitalism would mean the end of the state monopoly on force.\n\nIn \"Man, Economy, and State\", Rothbard divides the various kinds of state intervention in three categories: \"autistic intervention\", which is interference with private non-economic activities; \"binary intervention\", which is forced exchange between individuals and the state; and \"triangular intervention\", which is state-mandated exchange between individuals. According to Sanford Ikeda, Rothbard's typology \"eliminates the gaps and inconsistencies that appear in Mises's original formulation\". Rothbard writes in \"Power and Market\" that the role of the economist in a free market is limited, but it is much larger in a government that solicits economic policy recommendations. Rothbard argues that self-interest therefore prejudices the views of many economists in favor of increased government intervention.\n\nMichael O'Malley, Associate Professor of History at George Mason University, characterizes Rothbard's \"overall tone regard[ing]\" the civil rights movement and the women's suffrage movement to be \"contemptuous and hostile\". Rothbard vilified women's rights activists, attributing the growth of the welfare state to politically active spinsters \"whose busybody inclinations were not fettered by the responsibilities of health and heart\". Rothbard had pointed out in his \"Origins of the Welfare State\" that progressives had evolved from elitist Gilded Age pietist Protestants that wanted to bring a secularized version of millennialism under a welfare state, which was spearheaded by a \"shock troop of Yankee protestant and Jewish women and lesbian spinsters\".\n\nRothbard called for the elimination of \"the entire 'civil rights' structure\" stating that it \"tramples on the property rights of every American\". He consistently favored repeal of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, including Title VII regarded employment discrimination and called for overturning the \"Brown v. Board of Education\" decision on the grounds that forced integration of schools was aggressive. In an essay called \"Right-wing Populism\", Rothbard proposed a set of measures to \"reach out\" to the \"middle and working classes\", which included urging the police to crack down on \"street criminals\", writing that \"cops must be unleashed\" and \"allowed to administer instant punishment, subject of course to liability when they are in error\". He also advocated that the police \"clear the streets of bums and vagrants\" and quipped \"who cares?\" in response to the question of where these people would go after being removed from public property.\n\nRothbard held strong opinions about many leaders of the civil rights movement. He considered black separatist Malcolm X to be a \"great black leader\" and integrationist Martin Luther King Jr. to be favored by whites because he \"was the major restraining force on the developing Negro revolution\". Rothbard praised Malcolm X for \"acting white\" through use of his intellect and wit and contrasted him favorably with the \"fraudulent intellectual with a rococo Black Baptist minister style, \"Dr.\" King\". However, while he compared Malcolm X's black nationalism favorably to King's integrationism and for a time praised black nationalism, in 1993 he rejected the vision of a \"separate black nation\", asking \"does anyone really believe that [...] New Africa would be content to strike out on its own, with no massive \"foreign aid\" from the U.S.A.?\". Rothbard also suggested that opposition to King, whom he demeaned as a \"coercive integrationist\", should be a litmus test for members of his \"paleolibertarian\" political movement.\n\nPolitical scientist Jean Hardisty commented on Rothbard's \"praise\" of the argument, made in Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray's book \"The Bell Curve\", that blacks tend to score on average lower than whites on IQ tests. Hardisty noted that Rothbard's remark on intellectual and \"temperamental\" differences between races are \"self-evident\".\n\nLike Randolph Bourne, Rothbard believed that \"war is the health of the state\". According to David Gordon, this was the reason for Rothbard's opposition to aggressive foreign policy. Rothbard believed that stopping new wars was necessary and that knowledge of how government had led citizens into earlier wars was important. Two essays expanded on these views \"War, Peace, and the State\" and \"The Anatomy of the State\". Rothbard used insights of Vilfredo Pareto, Gaetano Mosca and Robert Michels to build a model of state personnel, goals and ideology. In an obituary for his friend historical revisionist Harry Elmer Barnes, Rothbard wrote:\nRothbard's colleague Joseph Stromberg notes that Rothbard made two exceptions to his general condemnation of war: \"the American Revolution and the War for Southern Independence, as viewed from the Confederate side\". Rothbard condemned the \"Northern war against slavery\", saying it was inspired by \"fanatical\" religious faith and characterized by \"a cheerful willingness to uproot institutions, to commit mayhem and mass murder, to plunder and loot and destroy, all in the name of high moral principle\". He celebrated Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and other prominent Confederates as heroes while denouncing Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant and other Union leaders for \"open[ing] the Pandora's Box of genocide and the extermination of civilians\" in their war against the South.\n\nRothbard's \"The Libertarian Forum\" blamed the Middle East conflict on Israeli aggression \"fueled by American arms and money\". Rothbard warned that the Middle East conflict would draw the United States into a world war. He was anti-Zionist and opposed United States involvement in the Middle East. Rothbard criticized the Camp David Accords for having betrayed Palestinian aspirations and opposed Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In his essay, \"War Guilt in the Middle East\", Rothbard states that Israel refused \"to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them\". He took negative views of the two state solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, saying: On the one hand there are the Palestinian Arabs, who have tilled the soil or otherwise used the land of Palestine for centuries; and on the other, there are a group of external fanatics, who come from all over the world, and who claim the entire land area as \"given\" to them as a collective religion or tribe at some remote or legendary time in the past. There is no way the two claims can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. There can be no genuine settlement, no \"peace\" in the face of this irrepressible conflict; there can only be either a war to the death, or an uneasy practical compromise which can satisfy no one. That is the harsh reality of the Middle East.\n\nRothbard embraced \"historical revisionism\" as an antidote to what he perceived to be the dominant influence exerted by corrupt \"court intellectuals\" over mainstream historical narratives. Rothbard wrote that these mainstream intellectuals distorted the historical record in favor of \"the state\" in exchange for \"wealth, power, and prestige\" from the state. Rothbard characterized the revisionist task as \"penetrating the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history\". He was influenced by and called a champion of the historian Harry Elmer Barnes, a Holocaust denier. Rothbard endorsed Barnes's revisionism on World War II, favorably citing his view that \"the murder of Germans and Japanese was the overriding aim of World War II\". In addition to broadly supporting his historical views, Rothbard promoted Barnes as an influence for future revisionists.\n\nRothbard's endorsing of World War II revisionism and his association with Barnes and other Holocaust deniers have drawn criticism from within the political right. Kevin D. Williamson wrote an opinion piece published by \"National Review\" which condemned Rothbard for \"making common cause with the 'revisionist' historians of the Third Reich\", a term he used to describe American Holocaust deniers associated with Rothbard, such as James J. Martin of the Institute for Historical Review. The piece also characterized \"Rothbard and his faction\" as being \"culpably indulgent\" of Holocaust denial, the view which \"specifically denies that the Holocaust actually happened or holds that it was in some way exaggerated\".\n\nIn an article for Rothbard's 50th birthday, Rothbard's friend and Buffalo State College historian Ralph Raico stated that Rothbard \"is the main reason that revisionism has become a crucial part of the whole libertarian position\".\n\nIn the \"Ethics of Liberty\", Rothbard explores issues regarding children's rights in terms of self-ownership and contract. These include support for a woman's right to abortion, condemnation of parents showing aggression towards children and opposition to the state forcing parents to care for children. He also holds children have the right to run away from parents and seek new guardians as soon as they are able to choose to do so. He asserted that parents have the right to put a child out for adoption or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a \"flourishing free market in children\". He believes that selling children as consumer goods in accord with market forces—while \"superficially monstrous\"—will benefit \"everyone\" involved in the market: \"the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing\".\n\nIn Rothbard's view of parenthood, \"the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights\". Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have the legal right to let any infant die by starvation and should be free to engage in other forms of child neglect. However, according to Rothbard, \"the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children\". In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, \"the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum\".\n\nEconomist Gene Callahan of Cardiff University, formerly a scholar at the Rothbard-affiliated Mises Institute, observes that Rothbard allows \"the logical elegance of his legal theory\" to \"trump any arguments based on the moral reprehensibility of a parent idly watching her six-month-old child slowly starve to death in its crib\".\n\nRothbard consistently advocated for abolition of the subpoena power, court attendance, contempt of court powers, coerced testimony of witnesses, compulsory jury duty and the bail system, arguing that all these functions of the judiciary were violations of natural rights and American common law. He instead advocated that until a defendant is convicted, he or she should not be held in prison or jails, writing that \"except in those cases where the criminal has been caught red-handed and where a certain presumption of guilt therefore exists, it is impossible to justify any imprisonment before conviction, let alone before trial. And even when someone is caught red-handed, there is an important reform that needs to be instituted to keep the system honest: subjecting the police and the other authorities to the same law as everyone else. If everyone is supposed to be subject to the same criminal law, then exempting the authorities from that law gives them a legal license to commit continual aggression. The policeman who apprehends a criminal and arrests him, and the judicial and penal authorities who incarcerate him before trial and conviction—all should be subject to the universal law\". Rothbard argued that police who make wrongful arrests or indictments should be charged with kidnapping.\n\nIn \"The Ethics of Liberty\", Rothbard advocates for a \"frankly retributive theory of punishment\" or a system of \"a tooth (or two teeth) for a tooth\". Rothbard emphasizes that all punishment must be proportional, stating that \"the criminal, or invader, loses his rights to the extent that he deprived another man of his\". Applying his retributive theory, Rothbard states that a thief \"must pay double the extent of theft\". Rothbard gives the example of a thief who stole $15,000 and says he not only would have to return the stolen money, but also provide the victim an additional $15,000, money to which the thief has forfeited his right. The thief would be \"put in a [temporary] state of enslavement to his victim\" if he is unable to pay him immediately. Rothbard also applies his theory to justify beating and torturing violent criminals, although the beatings are required to be proportional to the crimes for which they are being punished.\n\nIn chapter twelve of \"Ethics\", Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police. He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime. Writes Rothbard: \"Suppose [...] police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault\". Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to frame the suspect after having tortured him or her.\n\nIn an essay condemning \"scientism in the study of man\", Rothbard rejected the application of causal determinism to human beings, arguing that the actions of human beings—as opposed to those of everything else in nature—are not determined by prior causes, but by \"free will\". He argued that \"determinism as applied to man, is a self-contradictory thesis, since the man who employs it relies implicitly on the existence of free will\". Rothbard opposed what he considered the overspecialization of the academy and sought to fuse the disciplines of economics, history, ethics and political science to create a \"science of liberty\". Rothbard described the moral basis for his anarcho-capitalist position in two of his books: \"For a New Liberty\", published in 1973; and \"The Ethics of Liberty\", published in 1982. In his \"Power and Market\" (1970), Rothbard describes how a stateless economy might function.\n\nAs a young man, Rothbard considered himself part of the Old Right, an anti-statist and anti-interventionist branch of the Republican Party. In the 1948 presidential election, Rothbard, \"as a Jewish student at Columbia, horrified his peers by organizing a Students for Strom Thurmond chapter, so staunchly did he believe in states' rights\".\n\nBy the late 1960s, Rothbard's \"long and winding yet somehow consistent road had taken him from anti-New Deal and anti-interventionist Robert Taft supporter into friendship with the quasi-pacifist Nebraska Republican Congressman Howard Buffett (father of Warren Buffett) then over to the League of (Adlai) Stevensonian Democrats and, by 1968, into tentative comradeship with the anarchist factions of the New Left\". Rothbard advocated an alliance with the New Left anti-war movement on the grounds that the conservative movement had been completely subsumed by the statist establishment. However, Rothbard later criticized the New Left for supporting a \"People's Republic\" style draft. It was during this phase that he associated with Karl Hess and founded \"\" with Leonard Liggio and George Resch, which existed from 1965 to 1968.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1984, he edited \"The Libertarian Forum\", also initially with Hess (although Hess's involvement ended in 1971). The \"Libertarian Forum\" provided a platform for Rothbard's writing. Despite its small readership, it engaged conservatives associated with the \"National Review\" in nationwide debate. Rothbard rejected the view that Ronald Reagan's 1980 election as President was a victory for libertarian principles and he attacked Reagan's economic program in a series of \"Libertarian Forum\" articles. In 1982, Rothbard called Reagan's claims of spending cuts a \"fraud\" and a \"hoax\" and accused Reaganites of doctoring the economic statistics in order to give the false impression that their policies were successfully reducing inflation and unemployment. He further criticized the \"myths of Reaganomics\" in 1987.\n\nRothbard criticized the \"frenzied nihilism\" of left-wing libertarians, but also criticized right-wing libertarians who were content to rely only on education to bring down the state; he believed that libertarians should adopt any moral tactic available to them in order to bring about liberty.\n\nImbibing Randolph Bourne's idea that \"war is the health of the state\", Rothbard opposed all wars in his lifetime and engaged in anti-war activism. During the 1970s and 1980s, Rothbard was active in the Libertarian Party. He was frequently involved in the party's internal politics. He was one of the founders of the Cato Institute and \"came up with the idea of naming this libertarian think tank after \"Cato's Letters\", a powerful series of British newspaper essays by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon which played a decisive influence upon America's Founding Fathers in fomenting the Revolution\". From 1978 to 1983, he was associated with the Libertarian Party Radical Caucus, allying himself with Justin Raimondo, Eric Garris and Williamson Evers. He opposed the \"low-tax liberalism\" espoused by 1980 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Ed Clark and Cato Institute president Edward H Crane III. According to Charles Burris, \"Rothbard and Crane became bitter rivals after disputes emerging from the 1980 LP presidential campaign of Ed Clark carried over to strategic direction and management of Cato\".\n\nRothbard split with the Radical Caucus at the 1983 national convention over cultural issues and aligned himself with what he called the \"right-wing populist\" wing of the party, notably Lew Rockwell and Ron Paul, who ran for President on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988. Rothbard \"worked closely with Lew Rockwell (joined later by his long-time friend Burton Blumert) in nurturing the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and the publication, \"The Rothbard-Rockwell Report\"; which after Rothbard's 1995 death evolved into the website, \"LewRockwell.com\"\".\n\nIn 1989, Rothbard left the Libertarian Party and began building bridges to the post-Cold War anti-interventionist right, calling himself a paleolibertarian, a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism. Paleolibertarianism sought to appeal to disaffected working class whites through a synthesis of cultural conservatism and libertarian economics. According to \"Reason\", Rothbard advocated right-wing populism in part because he was frustrated that mainstream thinkers were not adopting the libertarian view and suggested that former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke and Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy were models for an \"Outreach to the Rednecks\" effort that could be used by a broad libertarian/paleoconservative coalition. Working together, the coalition would expose the \"unholy alliance of 'corporate liberal' Big Business and media elites, who, through big government, have privileged and caused to rise up a parasitic Underclass\". Rothbard blamed this \"Underclass\" for \"looting and oppressing the bulk of the middle and working classes in America\". Rothbard noted that Duke's substantive political program in a Louisiana governor's race had \"nothing\" in it that \"could not also be embraced by paleoconservatives or paleo-libertarians; lower taxes, dismantling the bureaucracy, slashing the welfare system, attacking affirmative action and racial set-asides, calling for equal rights for all Americans, including whites\".\n\nRothbard supported the presidential campaign of Pat Buchanan in 1992 and wrote that \"with Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy\". When Buchanan dropped out of the Republican primary race, Rothbard then shifted his interest and support to Ross Perot, who Rothbard wrote had \"brought an excitement, a verve, a sense of dynamics and of open possibilities to what had threatened to be a dreary race\". Rothbard ultimately supported George H. W. Bush over Bill Clinton in the 1992 election.\n\nLike Buchanan, Rothbard opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). However, by 1995 he had become disillusioned with Buchanan, believing that the latter's \"commitment to protectionism was mutating into an all-round faith in economic planning and the nation state\".\n\nAfter Rothbard's death in 1995, Lew Rockwell, president of the Mises Institute, told \"The New York Times\" that Rothbard was \"the founder of right-wing anarchism\". William F. Buckley Jr. wrote a critical obituary in the \"National Review\", criticizing Rothbard's \"defective judgment\" and views on the Cold War. The Mises Institute published \"Murray N.

{"id": "33575421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33575421", "title": "Rennes-le-Château", "text": "Rennes-le-Château\n\nRennes-le-Château () is a small commune approximately 5 km (3 miles) south of Couiza, in the Aude department in Languedoc in southern France.\n\nThis small French hilltop village is known internationally, and receives tens of thousands of visitors per year, because of various conspiracy theories, about an alleged buried treasure discovered by its 19th-century priest Bérenger Saunière, the precise nature of which is disputed by those who believe in its existence.\n\nMountains frame both ends of the region—the Cevennes to the northeast and the Pyrenees to the south. The area is known for beautiful scenery, with jagged ridges, deep river canyons and rocky limestone plateaus, with large caves underneath.\n\nRennes-le-Château was the site of a prehistoric encampment, and later a Roman colony, or at least Roman villa or temple, such as is confirmed to have been built at Fa, west of Couiza, part of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis, the wealthiest part of Roman Gaul.\n\nRennes-le-Château was part of Septimania in the 6th and 7th centuries. It has been claimed that it was once an important Visigothic town, with some 30,000 people living in the city around 500-600 AD. However, British archaeologist Bill Putnam and British physicist John Edwin Wood argued that while there may have been a Visigothic town on the site of the present village, it would have had \"a population closer to 300 than 30,000\".\n\nBy 1050 the Counts of Toulouse held control over the area, building a castle in Rennes-le-Château around 1002, though nothing remains above ground of this medieval structure—the present ruin is from the 17th or 18th century.\n\nSeveral castles in the surrounding Languedoc region were central to the battle between the Catholic Church and the Cathars at the beginning of the 13th century. Other castles guarded the volatile border with Spain. Whole communities were wiped out in the campaigns of the Catholic authorities to rid the area of the Cathar heretics, the Albigensian Crusades, and again when French Protestants fought against the French monarchy two centuries before the French Revolution.\n\nThe village church dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene has been rebuilt several times. The earliest church of which there is any evidence on the site may date to the 8th century. However, this original church was almost certainly in ruins by the 10th or 11th century, when another church was built upon the site—remnants of which can be seen in Romanesque pillared arcades on the north side of the apse. This survived in poor repair until the 19th century, when it was renovated by the local priest, Bérenger Saunière. Surviving receipts and existing account books belonging to Saunière reveal that the renovation of the church, including works on the presbytery and cemetery, cost 11,605 Francs over a ten-year period between 1887 and 1897.\n\nOne of the new elements was the Latin inscription \"Terribilis est locus iste\" above the front doors, taken from the Common Dedication of a Church, which translates as: \"This is a place of awe\"; the rest of the dedication reads \"this is God's house, the gate of heaven, and it shall be called the royal court of God.\" The first part of the dedication is above the front doors—the rest inscribed on the arches over the two front doors of the church.\n\nInside the church, one of the added figures was of a devil holding up the holy water stoup. Its original head was stolen in 1996 and has never been recovered. A devil like figure holding up the holy water stoup is a rare and unusual choice for the interior decoration of a Church but not exclusive to the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene; a similar subject matter can be seen in the Saint Vincent Collegiate church in Montréal, a short distance from Rennes-le-Château.\n\nThe new figures and statues were not made especially for this church, but were chosen by Saunière from a catalogue published by Giscard, sculptor and painter in Toulouse who, among other things, offered statues and sculptures for church refurbishment.\n\nSaunière also funded the construction of the Tour Magdala, a tower-like structure originally named the Tour de L'horloge and later renamed after Saint Mary Magdalene. Saunière used it as his library. The structure includes a circular turret with twelve crenellations, on a belvedere that connected it to an orangery. The tower has a promenade linking it to the Villa Bethania, which was not actually used by the priest. He stated at his trial that it was intended as a home for retired priests. Surviving receipts and existing account books belonging to Saunière reveal that the construction of his estate (including the purchases of land) between 1898 and 1905 cost 26,417 Francs.\n\nFollowing Sauniere's renovations and redecoratations, the church was re-dedicated in 1897 by his bishop, Monsignor Billard.\n\nIn 1910–1911, Bérenger Saunière was summoned by the bishopric to appear before an ecclesiastical trial to face charges of trafficking in masses. He was found guilty and suspended of the priesthood. When asked to produce his account books, he refused to attend his trial.\nBelievers in the enigma have suggested that Saunière's estate was set up on a large-scale checkerboard, while others have claimed that Saunière produced a Mirror image of selected architectural features of his property. They also allege that Maurice Barrès's novels Roman à clef and The Sacred Hill are largely based on the Rennes-le-Château story involving Bérenger Saunière (while novels by Jules Verne are cited to show that the enigma predates Abbé Saunière).\n\nThe village received up to around 100,000 tourists each year at the height of popularity of Dan Brown's bestselling novel \"The Da Vinci Code\". The modern reputation of Rennes-le-Château rises mainly from claims and stories dating from the mid-1950s concerning the local 19th-century priest Father Bérenger Saunière. These stories influenced the authors of the worldwide bestseller \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\" in 1982, and that work in turn influenced Dan Brown when he wrote \"The Da Vinci Code\", published in 2003.\n\nThe first known popular article about Father Bérenger Saunière was written by Roger Crouquet in the Belgian magazine \"Le Soir illustré\", published in 1948. The author was visiting the Aude to meet his friend Monsieur Jean Mauhin, who originated from Belgium and had moved to Quillan to open a factory making bells and hats, and at his suggestion decided it would be a good idea to visit Rennes-le-Château. There Crouquet collected the testimonies of the villagers about Saunière. One person told how the priest \"preferred wine and women to practising the priesthood. At the end of the last century he had a rather original idea. He placed in foreign newspapers, especially in the United States, an advertisement announcing that the poor priest of Rennes-le-Château lived among heretics and had only the most meagre of resources. He moved the Christians of the whole world to such pity by announcing that the old church, an architectural gem, was heading for unavoidable destruction if urgent restoration work was not undertaken as soon as possible.\" Crouquet also added: \"The stoup which decorates the entrance to the chapel is carried by a horned devil with cloven hooves. An old woman remarked to us: 'It's the old priest, changed into a devil'.\"\n\nCrouquet's article faded into obscurity and it was left to Noël Corbu, a local man who had opened a restaurant in Saunière's former estate (called \"L'Hotel de la Tour\") in the mid-1950s, to turn the village into a household name. Corbu began circulating stories that Father Saunière had discovered \"parchments\" while renovating his church in 1892 that were to do with the treasure of Blanche of Castile, and which \"according to the archives\" consisted of 28,500,000 gold pieces. This was the treasure of the French crown assembled by Blanche de Castile to pay the ransom of Saint Louis IX, a prisoner of the infidels, the surplus of which she had hidden at Rennes-le-Château. Saunière had only found one part of it, so it was necessary to continue his investigations.\n\nCorbu also claimed that Rennes-le-Château was the capital of the Visigoths called \"Rhedae\", but this was another exaggeration: it was Narbonne that held that position. His claim can be traced back to a book by Louis Fédié entitled \"Le comté de Razès et le diocèse d'Alet\" (1880), that contained a chapter on the history of Rennes-le-Château; published as a booklet in 1994. Noël Corbu incorporated this story into his essay \"L'histoire de Rennes-le-Château\" that was deposited at the Departmental Archives at Carcassonne on 14 June 1962. Fédié's assertions concerning the population and importance of Rennes-le-Château have since been contradicted by archaeology and the work of more recent historians.\n\nCorbu's story was published in the book by Robert Charroux \"Trésors du monde\" in 1962, that caught the attention of Pierre Plantard, who decided to use and adapt Corbu's story for his own gain involving the mythological history of the Priory of Sion, that inspired the 1967 book \"L'Or de Rennes\" by author Gérard de Sède. Sède's book contained reproductions of \"parchments\" allegedly discovered by the priest Bérenger Saunière alluding to the survival of the line of Dagobert II, from which Plantard claimed to descent. Plantard and Sède fell out over book royalties and Philippe de Chérisey, Plantard's friend, revealed to have forged the parchments as part of the plot. At the same time, Plantard and Chérisey were also involved in planting fabricated documents in France's Bibliothèque Nationale that dealt with the secret history of the Priory of Sion.\n\nCorbu's story inspired author Robert Charroux to develop an active interest, and in 1958, with his wife Yvette and other members of The Treasure Seekers' Club that he founded in 1951, scanned the village and its church looking for treasure using a metal detector.\n\nIn 1969, Henry Lincoln, a British supporting actor and screenwriter for the BBC, read Gérard de Sède's book while on holiday in the Cévennes.He produced three BBC2 Chronicle documentaries between 1972 and 1979 and worked some of its material into the 1982 non-fictional bestseller, \"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\", that he co-wrote with Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh. The book alleged that the Priory of Sion guarded the Merovingian dynasty's bloodline, that the dynasty descended from a supposed marriage of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene and that Pierre Plantard was a modern-day descendant; Bérenger Saunière allegedly discovered that secret and amasses his wealth by blackmailing of the Holy See.\n\nThe blood-line hypotheses of Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh were later picked up in 2003 by Dan Brown's bestselling novel \"The Da Vinci Code\". Brown's novel never specifically mentioned Rennes-le-Château, but some key characters in the book had related names, such as Saunière, named after the priest, and \"Leigh Teabing\", whose name was derived from Richard Leigh and Michael Baigent. The two authors brought (and lost) a plagiarism suit against Brown in 2006. The extraordinary popularity of \"The Da Vinci Code\" reignited the interest of tourists, who come to the village to see sites associated with Saunière and Rennes-le-Château.\n\nThe sudden interest in Saunière's church generated by the stories circulated by Noël Corbu in the 1950s inspired two excavations of the church of St Mary Magdalene. The first was conducted by Dr André Malacan in May 1956, who, after excavating the subsoil of the church at the depth of approximately one metre, discovered some bones that included a skull bearing an incision, but they failed to discover \"anything of any interest\". Dr Malacan died in 1997, and the skull remained in the possession of his family until May 2014, when it was finally handed back to the village following several years of legal wrangling(carbon-dating of the skull has dated it to between 1281 and 1396). Between 1959 and 1963, Jacques Cholet, an engineer from Paris, also conducted several digs in the church, and also failed to discover anything of interest.\n\nIn November 1956, Monsieur Cotte of the \"Société des arts et des sciences de Carcassonne\" asked the membership during its monthly session about the treasure of Rennes-le-Château, which led to an investigation of the subject matter. Two members conducted on-the-spot research in March 1957 that lasted for one year. Local historian René Descadeillas commented: \"They found no evidence anywhere to support the assertion that, down the ages, any individual, family, group or clan could have accumulated a precious treasure-hoard at Rennes and then concealed it in the locality or its environs. What is more, the activities of the Abbé Saunière were undoubtedly eloquent of the sort of stratagems that he was accustomed to using in order to enrich himself.\"\n\nIn more recent times, a much-publicised 2003 excavation of the floor of the Tour Magdala by the Mayor of the village produced a stone, and not any anticipated treasure, following-up claims made by a Canadian who said he was related to one of the foremen who supervised Saunière's works. Another request, at the same time, was also made to excavate the church, but permission was refused by the \"Directions Régionales des Affaires Culturelles\" (or DRAC), the archaeological body of France.\n\nThe entire area around Rennes-le-Château became the focus of sensational claims in the 1950s and 1960s involving Blanche of Castile, the Merovingians, the Knights Templar, the Cathars, the treasures of the Temple of Solomon that was the booty of the Visigoths that included the Ark of the Covenant and the Menorah (the seven-branched candlestick from the Temple of Jerusalem). From the 1970s onwards claims have extended to the Priory of Sion, the Rex Deus, the Holy Grail, ley lines, sacred geometry alignments, the remains of Jesus Christ, alleged references to Mary Magdalene settling in the south of France, and even flying saucers. Well-known French authors like Jules Verne and Maurice Leblanc are suspected of leaving clues in their novels about their knowledge of the \"mystery\" of Rennes-le-Château.\n\nChristiane Amiel has commented:\n\nNo new theory has ever succeeded in entirely replacing any of the previous ones and, as the researches have intensified, so the various lines of investigation have accumulated and crossed in a system of ramifications in which criticism of one line of approach simply gives rise to others\n\nand\n\nToday the vogue is for analysing and checking the most minute details, for comparing and contrasting rival theories, for reviving old and unexplored lines of enquiry in a new guise, and for an unbridled pluralism which mixes together erudition and extrapolation, and makes recourse to geology, history, prehistory, esotericism, religious history, mysticism, the paranormal, ufology and other fields.\n\nRennes-le-Château conspiracy theories continue to be a popular ingredient in a publishing industry that is growing exponentially, and is the subject of press articles, radio and television programmes and films. Websites and blogs devoted to the alleged 'mysteries' exist in many different countries and authors' interviews can be accessed on podcasts.\n\nArchaeologist Paul Bahn considered the various claims surrounding the village of Rennes-le-Château as pure myth \"so beloved of occultists and 'aficionados' of the Unexplained\". He ranks the stories among those of the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis and ancient astronauts as a source of \"ill-informed and lunatic books\". Likewise another archaeologist Bill Putnam, co-author with John Edwin Wood of \"The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château, A Mystery Solved\" (2003, 2005) has dismissed all of the popular allegations as pseudo-history.\n\nLaura Miller, contributor to \"The New York Times\" books section, commented how the village of Rennes-le-Château had become \"a town that had become the French equivalent of Roswell or Loch Ness as a result of popular books by Gérard de Sède.\"\n\nChristiane Amiel commented in 2008 that the treasure of Rennes-le-Château \"seems to elude all the investigations that people make into it. Like the fairy gold which, in the popular fables, turns into manure as soon as a human being touches it, it remains impalpable. It can only exist as long as it remains on the distinctive level of the dream, between the real and the imaginary.\"\n\n\n\n"}

During this time, these men found the new lands that could be used for the economic benefit of their home countries. In order to understand these new lands and the resources that might be available, explorers fostered relationships with the native people. This led to the colonization of the Americas. The Catholic Church was an essential part of both the Spanish and Portuguese Empires so as the empires spread to new lands, it was the duty of the King to be sure Christianity was spread into the New World.\n\nOften these empires used missions to teach indigenous people about Christian values that were practised in Europe at this time. These values did not only include religious teachings but cultural aspects of life such as dress and behavior. Missions were formed in different ways across the Americas that have had a lasting impact on the culture of these areas. Catholicism is still a prevalent religion in both North and South America. The formation and implementation of the missions across the New World reflected the beliefs of the Catholic clerics who created and implemented the missions. In the Catholic church, monks, priests and other clerics take vows and are affiliated with a certain order. These orders, their ideologies, and era can be linked to the way of life and teaching in the missions.\n\nDespite extensive efforts and even successes in recovering the cultural history of the cultures colonized in the Americas, much of the evidence currently available comes from the colonizers themselves. Many of the cultures impacted by missionaries had no written language and were thus robbed of much of their oral history when the populations were decimated by Old World illnesses. Cultures that did possess written language, such as the Maya, often had their artifacts deemed sacrilegious and burned. Therefore, much of the evidence of these events comes from accounts of missionaries and—to a much smaller extent—archaeological investigation, and should be handled with care. Therefore, readers should consider the ethnocentric and theocratic context in which accounts recorded by missionaries are presented.\n\nCatholic missions were installed throughout the Americas in an effort to establish European order in the pursuit of gold, silver, and other resources. The missionaries' goal was to convert natives to Christianity and ease the transition into a colonial system and minimize the friction required to establish European dominance in the area. One symbolic example of this was the practice of constructing churches and cathedrals, such as Santa Domingo and Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption, on top of demolished native temples. Establishment of missions was often followed by the implementation of Encomienda systems, which forced native labor onto land granted to Europeans by the Spanish Crown and led to systematic oppression.\n\nPedro de Gante was a European missionary who desired assimilation of Native American communities in order to further educational discourse amongst indigenous communities. He was so influential in his work, he became known as \"The first teacher of the Americas\" (Campos, 89). Originally, Peeter Van der Moere, Pedro de Gante, came to New Spain, in 1523 also known as Mexico. A missionary, Pedro de Gante, wanted to spread the Christian faith to his native brothers and sisters. During this time, the mentality of the Spanish people was to not empower the indigenous people with knowledge because it would give them motivation to retaliate over their Spanish rulers. Nevertheless, Pedro de Gante saw the ritualistic practices being made by the indigenous, sacrificing animals, and as a missionary, saw the need for a change in faith. He decided in order to best approach theses indigenous communities he had to adapt to their way of life. He learned their native tongue and participated in their conversations and games (Lipp, 194). Despite having a stutter, he was a successful translator of Nahuatl and Spanish (Campos, 89). Additionally, Pedro de Gante was a big advocate of education of the youth, where he established schools throughout Mexico to cater to the indigenous communities (Britannica, 1998). His influence spanned so wide, others like him followed by example. Of the future missionaries to come to America, at least three of his compatriots came (Proano, 1972).\n\nIn addition to the encomienda system, the aggressive implementation of missions and their forcible establishment of reductions and congregations led to resistance and sometimes revolt in the native populations being colonized. Many natives agreed to join the reductions and congregations out of fear, but many were initially still allowed to quietly continue some of their religious practices. However, as treatment of natives grew worse and suppression of native customs increased, so did the resistance of the natives.\n\nThe most notable example of rebellion against colonization is the Pueblo Revolt in 1680, in which the Zuni, Hopi, as well as Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, Tano, and Keres-speaking Pueblos took control of Santa Fe and drove the Spanish colonial presence out of New Mexico with heavy casualties on the Spanish side, including 21 of the 33 Franciscan missionaries in New Mexico. The region remained autonomous under native control despite multiple non-violent attempts at peace treaties and trade agreements until 1692.\n\nThe Tepehuan Revolt was likewise stirred by hostilities against the missionaries, which arose due to the concurrent and explosive rise in disease that accompanied their arrival. The Tepehuan associated the rise in death directly with these missionaries and their reductions, which spread disease and facilitated exploitative labor to encomanderos and miners. The revolt lasted from 1616 to 1620 with heavy casualties on both sides, during which time the Spanish abandoned their policy of \"peace by purchase (tribute)\" in favor of \"war of fire and blood\".\n\nWith resistance and revolts, the native population dropped drastically with the introduction of Spanish missions. However, the main factor for the overwhelming losses were due to epidemics in the missions. Despite being affected before the introduction of missions, the buildings allowed rodents to infiltrate living areas and spread disease more rapidly. Many natives were living in cramped spaces with poor hygiene and poor nutrition. This led not only to high mortality rate, but to low fertility rates as well. It is estimated that every 20 years or so, a new epidemic would wipe out the adult population of natives in many missions, giving no chance for recovery. (Newson, 2005)\n\nIn converting natives, missionaries had to find various ways of implementing sacramental practices among them. Some sacraments, like Baptism, were already similar to the Nahuatl rituals during birth, usually performed by a midwife. Many missionaries even allowed for natives to keep some aspects of their original ritual in place, like giving the child or newborn a small arrowhead or broom to represent their future roles in society, as long as it complied with Catholic beliefs. Other sacraments, like Matrimony, were fairly different from native practices. Many natives were polygamous and to perform the sacrament of marriage, Franciscan monks would have a husband bring his many wives to the church, having them all state their reasons for being the one true wife. The monks would then decide based on the testimony who was his wife and perform the sacrament. (Reilly, 2016)\n\nIn addition to religious changes, Spanish missionaries also brought about secular changes. With each generation of natives, there was a gradual shift in what they ate, wore and how the economy within the missions worked. Missionaries introduced adobe style houses for nomadic natives and domesticated animals for meat rather than wild game. The Spanish colonists also brought more foods and plants from Europe and South American to regions that initially had no contact with nations there. Natives began to dress in European-style clothing and adopted the Spanish language, often morphing it with Nahuatl and other native languages. (Jackson,1995)\n\nFranciscan missionaries were the first to arrive in New Spain, in 1523, following the Cortes expeditions in Mexico, and soon after began establishing missions across the continents. In addition to their primary goal of spreading Christianity, the missionaries studied the native languages, taught children to read and write, and taught adults trades such as carpentry and ceramics. The first missionaries to arrive in the New World were Franciscan monks from the observant faction which believed in a strict and limited way of practicing religion. Because the monks believed teaching and practicing can only be done through \"meditation and contemplation\", Franciscans were not able to convert as many people as quickly as the Spanish would have liked. This caused strain between colonial governments and Franciscan friars, which eventually led to several of the friars fleeing to present day western Mexico and the dissolution of Franciscan parishes. Other issues also contributed to the dissolution of Franciscan parishes including the vow of poverty and accusations made by the colonial governments. However, Spanish missions often used money provided by the King to fund missions. Having monks taking money proved to be a controversial issue within the church. In addition, the colonial government claimed missionaries were mistreating indigenous people who were working on the missions. On the other hand, the Franciscan missionaries claimed that the Spanish government enslaved and mistreated indigenous people. Present day efforts are to show where Franciscan missionaries protected the indigenous people from Spanish cruelties and supported empowering the native peoples.\n\nThe Jesuits had a wide-spread impact between their arrival in the New World about 1570 until their expulsion in 1767. The Jesuits, especially in the southeastern part of South America, followed a widespread Spanish practice of creating settlements called \"reductions\" to concentrate the widespread native populations in order to better rule, Christianize, and protect the native populace. The Jesuit Reductions were socialist societies in which each family would receive a house and field, and individuals were clothed and fed in return for work. Additionally, the communities would include schools, churches, and hospitals as well as native leaders and governing councils to be overseen by two Jesuit missionaries in each reduction. Like the Franciscans, the Jesuit missionaries learned the local languages and trained the adults in European methods of construction, manufacturing, and, to a certain extent, agriculture. Spanish settlers were prohibited from living or working in reductions. This led to a strained relationship between Jesuit missionaries and the Spanish because in surrounding Spanish settlements people were not guaranteed food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nAnother major Jesuit effort was that of Eusebio Kino S.J., in the region then known as the Pimería Alta – modern-day Sonora in Mexico and southern Arizona in the United States. \n\nThe Dominicans were centralized in the Caribbean and Mexico and, despite a much smaller representation in the Americas, had one of the most notable histories of native rights activism. Bartolomé de las Casas was the first Dominican bishop in Mexico and played a pivotal role in dismantling the practice of \"encomenderos\",these laws were intended to prevent the exploitation and mistreatment of the indigenous peoples of the Americas by the \"encomenderos\", by strictly limiting their power and dominion over groups of natives, with the establishment of the New Laws in 1542.\n\n\n Newson, Linda. \"The Demographic Impact of Colonization.\" \"The Cambridge Economic History of Latin America\".

Born in the Coney Island area of New York, New York, he wrote a number of books touching upon various subjects from the 1960s to 1980s. He expressed particular interest in indigenous American peoples and their complex history into the 20th century. As an instructor, he lectured at a variety of U.S. institutions, including the University of New Mexico.\n\nAlthough his writings became strongly associated with the American heartland, Steiner was born in the Coney Island area of New York, New York. After moving around in his early years, he underwent studies at the University of Wisconsin. His parents had immigrated to the U.S. from the nation of Austria.\n\nSpecific works by Steiner include \"The New Indians\" (1968), \"La Raza: The Mexican Americans\" (1970), \"The Vanishing White Man\" (1976), and \"The Ranchers: A Book of Generations\" (1980). As a professor, he notably taught at the University of New Mexico. He lectured at various other U.S. institutions as well.\n\nA 1976 article on his then latest book by \"Kirkus Reviews\" remarked that it was \"to Steiner's credit that he includes the testimony of other Western voices\" regular readers studying the U.S. frontier don't often hear, including \"a Hopi elder, a thoughtful young Indian activist, a white Montana rancher, Senator Abourezk of South Dakota, Black Elk's granddaughter, and others.\" The analysis of \"The Vanishing White Man\", looking into the cultural contrast argument about modern U.S. citizens breaking the 'circle of life' cycle and connection to the land held by prior generations of indigenous American peoples, followed-up from similar observations made in his 1968 book that he titled \"The New Indians\".\n\nThe same publication praised his later work \"The Ranchers: A Book of Generations\". In it, Steiner detailed the lives of a group of ranchers living in traditional fashion within several rural areas, the author going into the individualist approaches aiming at maintaining self-sufficiency that the men and women had struggled with. Finding the \"not sentimental\" work still \"sometimes moving\", \"Kirkus Reviews\" declared, \"As a composite picture of the vanishing rancher, the volume is [an] informative... [and] historically valuable antidote to the TV cowboy\".\n\nSteiner died of a heart attack in 1987 inside his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was 62 years old. A collection of his essays was later put together in 1991 under the title \"The Waning of the West\", receiving acclaim from publications such as \"Publishers Weekly\". Writer John Nichols composed the book's forward.\n\nSeveral years after the historian's death, \"Publishers Weekly\" remarked,\nEarlier in his life, Steiner had been a caustic critic of U.S. President Richard Nixon, arguing that the administration had sold out national interests in the West to private efforts by corporations.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1830725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830725", "title": "The 300 Spartans", "text": "The 300 Spartans\n\nThe 300 Spartans is a 1962 CinemaScope epic film depicting the Battle of Thermopylae. Made with the cooperation of the Greek government, it was shot in the village of Perachora in the Peloponnese. The working title was \"Lion of Sparta\". It stars Richard Egan as the Spartan king Leonidas, Sir Ralph Richardson as Themistocles of Athens and David Farrar as Persian king Xerxes, with Diane Baker as Ellas and Barry Coe as Phylon providing the requisite romantic element in the film. Greek warriors, led by 300 Spartans, fight against a Persian army of almost limitless size. Despite the odds, the Spartans will not flee or surrender, even if it means their deaths.\n\nWhen it was released in 1962, critics saw the movie as a commentary on the Cold War, referring to the independent Greek states as \"the only stronghold of freedom remaining in the then known world\", holding out against the Persian \"slave empire\".\n\nXerxes I of Persia leads a vast army of soldiers into Europe to defeat the small city-states of Greece, not only to fulfill the idea of \"one world ruled by one master\", but also to avenge the defeat of his father at the Battle of Marathon ten years before. Accompanying him are Artemisia, the Queen of Halicarnassus, who beguiles Xerxes with her feminine charm, and Demaratus, an exiled king of Sparta, to whose warnings Xerxes pays little heed.\n\nIn Corinth, Themistocles of Athens wins the support of the Greek allies and convinces both the delegates and the Spartan representative, Leonidas I, to grant Sparta leadership of their forces. Outside the hall, Leonidas and Themistocles agree to fortify the pass at Thermopylae until the rest of the army arrives. After this, Leonidas learns of the Persian advance and travels to Sparta to spread the news.\n\nIn Sparta, his fellow king Leotychidas is fighting a losing battle with the Ephors over the religious festival of Carnea that is due to take place, with members of the council arguing that the army should wait until after the festival is over before it marches, while Leotychidas fears that by that time the Persians may have conquered Greece. Leonidas decides to march north immediately with his personal bodyguard of 300 men, who are exempt from the decisions of the Ephors and the Gerousia. They are subsequently reinforced by Thespians led by Demophilus and other Greek allies.\n\nAfter several days of fighting, Xerxes grows angry as his army is repeatedly routed by the Greeks, with the Spartans in the forefront. Leonidas receives word that, by decision of the Ephors, the remainder of the Spartan army, rather than joining him as he had expected, will only fortify the isthmus in the Peloponnese and will advance no further. The Greeks constantly beat back the Persians, and following the defeat of his personal bodyguard in battle against the Spartans, Xerxes begins to consider withdrawing to Sardis until he can equip a larger force at a later date. As he prepares to withdraw, however, Xerxes receives word from the treacherous and avaricious Ephialtes of a goat-track through the mountains that will enable his forces to attack the Greeks from the rear. Promising to reward Ephialtes for his betrayal, Xerxes sends his army onward.\n\nOnce Leonidas realizes he will be surrounded, he sends away the Greek allies to alert the cities to the south. Being too few to hold the pass, the Spartans instead attack the Persian front, where Xerxes is nearby. Leonidas is killed in the melée. Meanwhile, the Thespians, who had refused to leave, are overwhelmed (offscreen) while defending the rear. Surrounded, the surviving Spartans refuse Xerxes's demand to give up Leonidas' body. They are then annihilated by arrowfire.\n\nAfter this, narration states that the Battle of Salamis and the Battle of Plataea end the Persian invasion, which could not have been organized without the time bought by the 300 Spartans who defied the tyranny of Xerxes at Thermopylae. One of the final images of the film is the memorial bearing the epigram of Simonides of Ceos, which is recited.\n\nThe battle scenes were shot near the village of Perachora, on the mainland side of the Corinth Canal, as it was impossible to shoot at the actual location in Thermopylae where 2,500 years of silt has shrunk the Malian Gulf drastically since the battle in 480 B.C., turning the strait where the battle was fought into a broad coastal plain. The Greek Ministry of National Defence agreed to make available to the producers up to 5,000 members of the Hellenic Army for a pre-negotiated fee. However, the film's budgetary constraints reduced the numbers drawn to only two battalions (approximately 1,100 men). For the largest establishing scenes—the Persian Army entering Greece—many of these soldiers, together with a combined total of several hundred civilian extras, horses, cattle, ox carts and chariots were utilized. For the wider establishing scenes of the battle, one battalion was retained to play both Greeks and Persians. For closer compositions of the fighting and encampments, military extras were called (call-sheeted) by company-size or smaller units, in meeting the specific needs of the day's shooting schedule. Director of Photography, Geoffrey Unsworth, made good use of the tree groves, which lined the coastal plain aside the \"Limni Vouliagmeni\" lagoon, to cover for the obvious deficiency in the number of troops that would have been amassed on the Persian-side of the battle line.\n\nOriginally developed as an Italian sword-and-sandal project, the cooperation and blessing of the Greek military and the Hellenic Royal Family allowed producer, George St. George, to both finance and complete the production on a budget of 500,000 GBP (approximately, $1,350,000), roughly twice what most Italian peplum films were being made for at the time. \"The 300 Spartans\" was the last film of Richard Egan's seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. It was also the last film appearance of David Farrar, who then chose to retire from acting.\n\nDespite Cold War connotations the film was dubbed in Russian and it was shown in the USSR in 1970. The film was very popular there—27.1 million of viewers had seen it.\n\n\nComic artist Frank Miller saw this movie as a boy and said \"it changed the course of my creative life\". His graphic novel \"300\" is about the Battle of Thermopylae, and in 2006, the book was adapted into a successful film.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18391710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18391710", "title": "The Myth of the Machine", "text": "The Myth of the Machine\n\nThe Myth of the Machine is a two-volume book taking an in-depth look at the forces that have shaped modern technology since prehistoric times. The first volume, \"Technics and Human Development\", was published in 1967, followed by the second volume, \"The Pentagon of Power\", in 1970. The author, Lewis Mumford, shows the parallel developments between human tools and social organization mainly through language and rituals. It is considered a synthesis of many theories Mumford developed throughout his prolific writing career. Volume 2 was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection.\n\n\"In \"The Myth of the Machine\", Mumford insisted upon the reality of the megamachine: the convergence of science, economy, technics and political power as a unified community of interpretation rendering useless and eccentric life-enhancing values. Subversion of this authoritarian kingdom begins with that area of human contact with the world that cannot be successfully repressed - one's feelings about one's self.\"\n\nIn the Prologue, Mumford defines his purpose here as \"to question both the assumptions and the predictions upon which our commitment to the present forms of scientific and technical progress, treated as ends in themselves, have been based.\"\n\nMumford dates the emergence of the \"Machine\" from the pyramid age (primarily with reference to Egypt, but also acknowledging other ancient cultures in that era which produced massive and precisely engineered structures). He uses the term 'Megamachine' to describe the social and bureaucratic structure that enabled a ruler to coordinate a huge workforce to undertake vast and complex projects. Where the projects were public works such as irrigation systems and canals or the construction of cities, Mumford referred to the \"labour machine\", and where they involved conquest he used the expression \"military machine\". The term \"Megamachine\" connoted the social structure in its entirety.\n\nWilliam Manson writes that Mumford differed from other major critics of technology in that \"[Mumford] emphasized that the ultimate function of social structures (\"society\") should be to enhance individual development and mutually beneficial patterns of social cooperation. Living in such conducive, humanly-scaled communities, individuals could develop their many-sided capacities (moral/empathic, cognitive, aesthetic, etc.). Technical means, if limited to these human purposes and values, could enhance such growth and social well-being.\" Manson describes the dystopian vision of the future that Mumford warned of:\n\nIn this volume Mumford discusses the progress of terrestrial exploration, and scientific discovery; and traces the interplay of ideological interests, inventions and subjective drives in the evolution of human society. It expands upon the arguments he earlier promoted in \"Technics and Civilization\" (1934), and brings them up to date in the light of social developments in the intervening three decades. In the Preface he writes: \"...I have been driven, by the wholesale miscarriage of megatechnics, to deal with the collective obsessions and compulsions that have misdirected our energies, and undermined our abilities to live full and spiritually satisfying lives.\"\n\nThe \"pentagon\" refers to:\nThere was clearly also an oblique reference to the Pentagon, regarding which he commented: \"...the concrete form of the Pentagon in Washington serves even better than its Soviet counterpart, the Kremlin, as a symbol of totalitarian absolutism.\"\n\nAlthough much of the volume explores the negative influence of centralised power and exploitative behaviour on the human condition, it finishes on a positive and optimistic note in the closing chapters. His final remark is:\n\nWilliam Manson writes that \"Ultimately, Mumford advocated a negative revolt — resistance, refusal, withdrawal – whereby individuals may reclaim their autonomy and humanly-derived desires and choices.\"\n\n"}

Throughout this work, he advocates the idea that autocracy is the perfect form of government for Russia.\n\nA male-line descendant of the 9th-century prince Rurik, Tatischev was born near Pskov on April 19, 1686. Having graduated from the Engineering school in Moscow, he took part in the 1700-1721 Great Northern War with Sweden. In the service of Peter the Great he gained a prominent post in the Foreign Office, which he used to oppose the policies of the Supreme Privy Council and support Anna's ascension to the Russian throne in 1730. \n\nHe was entrusted by Anna with a lucrative office of the management of Ural factories. At that post he founded the cities of Perm and Yekaterinburg, which have since grown into the veritable capitals of the Urals. A monument to him was opened in Perm in 2003. During the Bashkir War of 1735-40 he was in command of Siberian operations from the winter of 1736-37 and head of the whole operation from the spring of 1737. He was removed from command after March 1739, nominally on charges of corruption, but mainly because he had made too many enemies. Tatischev finished his official career as a governor of Astrakhan (1741-44). He died at the Boldino estate near Moscow on July 15, 1750.\n\nHaving retired from active service, the elderly statesman dedicated himself to scholarly pursuits. Feeling that the Russian historiography had been neglected, he discovered and published several legal monuments of great interest, e.g., Russkaya Pravda and Sudebnik of 1550. His magnum opus was the first sketch of Russian history, entitled \"Russian History Dating Back to the Most Ancient Times\" and published in 5 volumes after his death. He also compiled the first encyclopedic dictionary of the Russian language. \n\nThe scientific merits of Tatischev's work were disputed even in the 18th century. It is true that he used some chronicles that have since been lost, leading Iakov Lur'e to write of \"Tatishchev Information,\" which he defined as \"data unique to that historian,\" but most of them (notably the Ioachim Chronicle) were of dubious authenticity. It is also true that he could never tell a genuine work from a fake, and some incidents inserted in his history could have been products of his own fancy. Only recently some prominent historians have demonstrated that Tatischev's lost sources may actually be relied on.\n\nA settlement and a district in Saratov Oblast are named after Tatishchev. There are monuments to Tatishchev in Perm and Yekaterinburg and in 1998 a large equestrian statue of Tatishchev was estasblished in Tolyatti.\n\nTatischev family\n\n\n"}

Leahy (born 1948) is the 25th President of Boston College, a post he has held since 1996. He was born in Omaha, Nebraska and raised in Imogene, Iowa. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1967, and is a member of the Jesuits' Wisconsin province. Leahy earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a master's degree in United States history at Saint Louis University in 1972 and 1975, respectively. He then began studies at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley in Berkeley, California, where he earned degrees in theology (1978) and historical theology (1980). He was ordained a priest in 1978. He received a doctoral degree in U.S. history from Stanford University in 1986.\n\nHe began his academic career as a teacher at Campion High School in Wisconsin from 1973 to 1975. He served as a teaching assistant at Stanford in 1981 before joining the Marquette University faculty as an instructor of history in 1985. He became an associate professor with tenure in 1991, and in that same year became Marquette's executive vice president.\n\nLeahy's memberships include the American Catholic Historical Association, the American Historical Association, the History of Education Society, and the Organization of American Historians.\n\nSince becoming Boston College president, Leahy has accelerated the growth and development of the university initiated by his predecessor J. Donald Monan. Boston College's endowment has continued to increase rapidly to more than $2 billion, making BC one of the 50 wealthiest universities in the nation. During the years after the global recession of 2008, Leahy's effective fiscal governance has enabled BC to emerge in a position of strength. BC had the fastest growing endowment of many high-ranking universities. During Leahy's presidency, the campus has expanded by almost 150 acres (607,000 m²), and undergraduate applications have surpassed 30,000. At the same time, its students, faculty and athletic teams have seen unprecedented success — winning record numbers of Truman, Marshall, Fulbright, Rhodes scholarships as well as other academic awards and research grants.\n\nIn 2006, after a two-year self-study involving more than 200 BC faculty, administrators, students and alumni, Leahy announced a $1.6-billion strategic plan that called for hiring 100 new faculty, adding a dozen new academic centers and spending $1 billion in construction and renovation projects to elevate Boston College to the highest echelon of premier national universities. The Plan set seven strategic directions for the University: To become a national leader in liberal arts education and student formation; to enhance its research initiatives in select natural sciences and in areas that address urgent society problems; to support leadership initiatives in BC’s graduate and professional schools; to expand international programs and partnerships. Leahy's stated goal was to establish Boston College as \"the world's leading Catholic university.\"\n\nIn line with this direction, the Weston Jesuit School of Theology re-affiliated with Boston College in 2008 to form the new School of Theology and Ministry. During the same year, Leahy started the construction of Stokes Hall, a administrative and classroom building for BC's humanities departments, which opened in 2012. Already in 2002, Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program to examine issues facing the Roman Catholic Church in light of the clergy sexual abuse scandal.\n\nIn athletics, Boston College won conference and national titles during Leahy's presidency: for example four national men's ice hockey championships. In 2005, it left the Big East Conference and joined the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\nLeahy's presidency has not been without controversy. He has fallen under much criticism for his inconsistent coherence to Boston College's Jesuit mission.\n\nHis Dean of Students declined to permit a dance sponsored by the BC gay and lesbian group, an event sponsored by the Boston College Woman's Health Initiative (pro-choice organization that is currently unrecognized by the university), and he has remained stalwart in his resistance to substantive changes to the university's policy toward groups that are contrary to Catholic teachings.\n\nThe move from the Big East to the Atlantic Coast Conference resulted in a lawsuit and editorializing by some Boston sports writers, though eventually BC won the lawsuits and membership in the ACC resulted in greater financial reward and national exposure for the athletic department. (ACC schools received an average of USD 10.85 million for the tax year ending June 30, 2006, Big East full members averaged a little more than half that at US $5,842,599.)\n\nThe invitation of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to receive an honorary degree and deliver the 2006 Commencement Address evoked protest from a small number of the faculty members. While Rice received a standing ovation accompanied by extended applause at the 2006 Commencement Exercises, a small subset of faculty did turn their backs toward the stage as she was presented an honorary degree.\n\n\nLeahy has written a number of articles on Catholic higher education in the United States, including, among others:\nIn addition, Leahy has authored numerous articles in the Dictionary of Christianity in America and book reviews in History, Journal of American History and History of Education Quarterly.\n"}
