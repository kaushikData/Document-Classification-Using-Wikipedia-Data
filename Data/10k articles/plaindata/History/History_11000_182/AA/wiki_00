Octavian's ascension to total power as the emperor Augustus is considered to mark the point in history where the Roman Republic ends and the Roman Empire begins.

The disputed territory had belonged to the Austro-Hungarian empire. At the centre of conflict was the position of the border that separated the two new states. In Slovene-language historiography, the conflict is known as the \"Boj za severno mejo\" (\"battle for the northern border\"), while in German-language historiography it is the \"Kärntner Abwehrkampf\" (\"Carinthian defensive struggle\").\n\nSlovene-speaking regions were integrated into several Austrian states throughout much of the 2nd millennium. The idea of South Slavic–speaking territories creating a new state of their own has been one of the key issues debated among Slovene intelligentsia throughout the second part of the 19th century, especially in the aftermath of the spring of nations. As a consequence of Austro-Hungarian invasion of Serbian Kingdom the Yugoslav committee was formed, with its goal being the unification of South Slavic lands known as Yugoslavia. In 1916 the Serbian parliament in exile voted in favour of creating a Kingdom of Yugoslavia as a plan of post-world war governance of the Balkan peninsula.\n\nAs a consequence of the World War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire began to dissolve even before an official end to war was declared. In period between 5–8 October 1918 a pro-Yugoslav National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs took control over the regional administration in Zagreb. On 29 October the National Council declared the formation of a Yugoslav state, following a rejection of a plan of greater autonomy within Austria-Hungary.\nEntente powers did not recognise the newly found state before it merged with Kingdom of Serbia only three days later in an effort to gain a stable and recognised country of all South Slavs, as well as discouraging Italy from conquering Slav-settled territory not accounted as war reparation to Italy in Treaty of London.\n\nNo formal border was yet recognised among the newly created entities, with both sides claiming that they are in control of the area along the ethnically mixed settlements. The National Government in Ljubljana did not pay any particular attention to the border issue, as it was planning on gaining much area through negotiations on the peace conference. The municipal council of the largely German-speaking town of Maribor (\"Marburg an der Drau\") declared the municipality to be a part of German-Austria on 30 October 1918.\n\nThe National Council for Styria (Slovene: \"Narodni svet za Štajersko\") gave permission to take control of the military branch in Maribor to Rudolf Maister, a veteran of the World War and a former officer of Austria-Hungary. He also gained the rank of a General, and was given authority over all military forces located in Styria under control of the Kingdom of SHS. On October 31 Rudolf Maister announced his disagreement with the municipal declaration of Maribor in front of an audience of Lieutenant Colonel Anton Holik and his officers at the Melj military barracks of the 26th infantry regiment. On 9 November Maister announced full mobilization of Lower Styria, which was disagreed with by both, the German-Austrian government and authorities in Ljubljana. The mobilization decree was successful as the armed forces grew to about 4,000 fighters, and establishing a new infantry regiment in Maribor by November 21.\n\nFirst Lieutenant Franjo Malgaj and his unit entered Carinthia on November 6. Captain Alfred Lavrič's unit was designated to be in charge of capturing Carinthia, and began taking control of the territory on 13 November, when his units entered the (German: \"Jauntal\", Slovene: \"Podjuna\") and Ferlach (Slovene: \"Borovlje\"). The Loibl Pass (German: \"Loiblpass\", Slovene: \"prelaz Ljubelj\") was captured the following day.\n\nOn November 23 Maister's fighters began to seize control of guard posts throughout the Maribor region by disarming the local guardsmen controlled by the Maribor municipality. Captain Rudolf Knez entered Sittersdorf (\"Žitara vas\") and settled his units there. From November 27 onward, the Slovene fighters under direct command of Maister, took control of Spielfeld (\"Špilje\"), Bad Radkersburg (\"Radgona\"), Mureck (\"Cmurek\"), Leutschach (\"Lučane\"), Marenberg (now Radlje ob Dravi), and Muta (\"Hohenmauthen\"), while the units from Celje under command of Franjo Malgaj took control of the (\"Mießtal\"), Bleiburg (\"Pliberk\"), where Serb volunteers returning from the Eastern front of World War I also joined Malgaj's unit. All the areas captured were agreed upon by General Rudolf Passy of Carinthia and General Maister on November 27. The agreement included allowance to take control of all Slovene-majority settlements, but remained unsupported and criticized by Styrian, Carinthian, German-Austrian authorities, as well as the National council in Ljubljana. Units from Ljubljana took control of Dravograd (\"Unterdrauburg\"), Lavamünd (\"Labot\") and Sankt Paul (\"Šentpavel\"). The capture of Völkermarkt (\"Velikovec\") on November 30 sparked much criticism, as it allegedly wasn't included in the demarcation line plans.\n\nFirst armed clashes already occurred under command of Malgaj during the attack on Bleiburg, but it was not until the battle in Lučane when violent confrontations became apparent. Lučane was the site of a first major clash between the two factions on January 14, 1919. Following minor fights between the two militias, a larger battle occurred on February 4 near Radgona. Plans were set by Maister to attack and capture Klagenfurt (\"Celovec\") but were abandoned following negotiations. On February 13 a peace treaty was signed by both parties.\n\nWith the occupation of southeastern Carinthia by Yugoslav troops, and the confrontation evolving into armed clashes, the provisional Carinthian government under Governor Arthur Lemisch decided to lead off the armed struggle in order to preserve the southern Carinthian border on the Karawanks. Bitter fighting of paramilitary groups around Arnoldstein and Ferlach alarmed the Entente powers. They arbitrated a ceasefire, whereafter a nine-day U.S. Army commission under Lt. Col. Sherman Miles scouted the disputed region between river and mountains in January and February 1919 and made the crucial recommendation that the Karawanks frontier should be retained, thus opening the possibility of a plebiscite. Yugoslav representatives urged for a border on the Drava; American delegates however spoke in favor of preserving the unity of the Klagenfurt Basin and convinced the British and French delegations to support their plan of plebiscite for the entire Klagenfurt region.\n\nOn April 29, Yugoslav troops breached ceasefire agreement after months of relative peace. Armed clashes occurred throughout the region, with noticeable territorial gains achieved by Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Yugoslav troops experienced much resistance in the following days, as Austrian troops already made effective counter-offensive actions. The situation for Slovenes worsened, and on the 2nd of May Carinthian units had already taken control of Völkermarkt. Two days later Austrian counter-offensive reached the Gallizien (Slovene: \"Galicija\")-Apače (German: \"Abstall\")-Sankt Margareten im Rosental (\"Šmarjeta\") line. After two days of fierce fighting the German-Austrian units successfully conquered the line and in process destroyed the 3rd infantry battalion from Ljubljana.\n\nThe remaining Slovene units continued to retreat back into lower Styria, while almost all of the Carinthian area that was gained during the winter clashes was lost to the advancing Austrian units. The last to fall was Dravograd before the Royal Yugoslav Army's 36th infantry regiment under control of Lt.Col. Vladimir Uzorinac managed to hold ground in G\"uštanj\" (\"Gutenstein in Kärnten\") and therefore stop the counter-offensive. General Maister sent two units of his Maribor infantry regiment to aid the troops holding ground near Slovenj Gradec. Officer Malgaj was killed on 6 May, one of the key leaders of the Slovene fighters in Carinthia.\n\nAfter a military defeat in the offensive initiated in April, authorities in Ljubljana mobilised all their assets and drafted regiments from Serbia to regain lost territory. On May 26 a new offensive was authorised which lasted throughout May and until June 6, during which they managed to capture much of the Klagenfurt region to as north as Maria Saal (\"Gospa Sveta\"). The offensive was considered a military success.\n\nThe Paris peace conference turned the tide, when an order was given to the Yugoslavs to completely retreat from the northern B zone of the Klagenfurt Basin area in a time frame set to end on 31 July, at the latest, to enable the commission to carry out the planned plebiscite.\n\nThe Treaty of Saint-Germain with the Republic of Austria, signed on 10 September 1919, should have determined the Austrian-Yugoslav border. It ascertained that some small parts of Carinthia, the Meža Valley with the town of Dravograd and the Jezersko municipal area, would be incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes while the fate of wider southeastern Carinthia area down to the Klagenfurt Basin was to be determined by a plebiscite.\n\nThe outcome of the plebiscite held on 10 October 1920, was 22,025 votes (59.1% of the total cast) for adhesion to Austria and 15,279 (40.9%) for annexation by the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. If the whole German-speaking minority voted for Austria, every second Carinthian Slovene agreed.\n\nWhile a majority in the remote Alpine villages on the slopes of the Karawanks voted for Yugoslavia, the inhabitants of the densely-settled Klagenfurt Basin were motivated by their evolved social, cultural and economic ties to the central Carinthian region.\n\nThe region was placed under Austrian administration on 18 November 1920 and declared part of the sovereign Austrian Republic on November 22. Until today, October 10 is a public holiday in the State of Carinthia.\n\nThe plebiscite ultimately determined the border between Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The border remained unchanged after World War II, even as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia gave way to Josip Broz Tito's Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, bur at the end of the war, Yugoslav Partisans again briefly occupied the area, including the capital city of Klagenfurt. Since the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the border separates Austria and Slovenia.\n"}

In 1683 he devoted himself entirely to the study of literature. In 1688 he became theologian of the duke of Parma, who desired to secure a man of such merit. In 1689 he introduced into the regulations of the Benedictine Order of St. Alexander of Parma certain modifications, which resulted in his being obliged to leave Parma. The duke of Modena appointed him in 1691 counsellor of the Inquisition.

{"id": "475582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=475582", "title": "Boater", "text": "Boater\n\nA boater (also straw boater, basher, skimmer, cady, katie, canotier, somer, sennit hat, or in Japan, can-can hat, suruken) is a kind of summer hat worn by men, regarded as somewhat formal, and particularly popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nIt is normally made of stiff sennit straw and has a stiff flat crown and brim, typically with a solid or striped grosgrain ribbon around the crown. Boaters were popular as summer headgear, especially for boating or sailing, hence the name. They were supposedly worn by FBI agents as a sort of unofficial uniform in the pre-war years. It was also worn by women, often with hatpins to keep it in place. Nowadays they are rarely seen except at sailing or rowing events, period theatrical and musical performances (e.g. barbershop music) or as part of old-fashioned school uniforms. Since 1952, the straw boater hat has been part of the uniform of the Princeton University Band, notably featured on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated Magazine\" in October, 1955. Boaters are also a part of the traditional and persisting garb of barbershop quartets. Recently, soft, thin straw hats with the approximate shape of a boater have been in fashion among women.\n\nThe boater is a fairly formal hat, equivalent in formality to the Homburg, and so is correctly worn either in its original setting with a blazer, or in the same situations as a Homburg, such as a smart lounge suit, or with black tie. John Jacob Astor IV was known for wearing such hats. Actors Harold Lloyd and Maurice Chevalier and the Italian engineer Stefano Zacchè were also famous for their trademark boater hats.\n\nInexpensive foam or plastic skimmers are sometimes seen at political rallies in the United States.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa the boater is still a common part of the school uniform in many boys' schools, such as at Harrow School, Shore School, Brisbane Boys' College, Knox Grammar School, Maritzburg College, South African College School, St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa), Wynberg Boys' High School, Parktown Boys' High School and numerous Christian Brothers schools (CCB).\n\nThe boater may also be seen worn by the \"carreiros\" of Madeira, the drivers of the traditional wicker toboggans carrying visitors from the parish church at Monte (Funchal) down towards Funchal centre.\n\nCoco Chanel was fond of wearing boaters and made them fashionable among women during the early 20th century.\n\nBeing made of straw, the boater was and is generally regarded as a warm-weather hat. In the days when all men wore hats when out of doors, \"Straw Hat Day\", the day when men switched from wearing their winter hats to their summer hats, was seen as a sign of the beginning of summer. The exact date of Straw Hat Day might vary slightly from place to place. For example, in Philadelphia, it was May 15; at the University of Pennsylvania, it was the second Saturday in May. Its cold-weather counterpart was \"Felt Hat Day\", occurring in September or October. The practice of wearing formal hats largely disappeared by the mid-1900s; however, as late as 1963, Straw and Felt Hat Day were commemorated in an editorial in the \"New York Times\".\n\nIn some cities, the convention was forcefully observed by young men who would seize and destroy any straw hat worn after the appointed day. On a number of stock exchange floors, traders wore straw hats with the deliberate intention of getting them destroyed. (Confusingly, the term \"straw hat day\" was used in that era to refer both to the day of their adoption, at the beginning of summer, and their destruction, at the end.) In 1922 in New York City, the tradition escalated into the Straw Hat Riot, which lasted eight days, involved a mob of 1,000 young hat destroyers at its peak, and resulted in a number of arrests and injuries.\n\n"}

The report marked a pivotal moment in the controversy that has come to be known as the Stolen Generations.\n\nThe inquiry was established by the federal Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, on 11 May 1995, in response to efforts made by key Indigenous agencies and communities concerned that the general public's ignorance of the history of forcible removal was hindering the recognition of the needs of its victims and their families and the provision of services. The 680-page report was tabled in Federal Parliament on 26 May 1997.\n\nAboriginal organisations pushed for a national inquiry as early as 1990. The Secretariat of the National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (SNAICC) resolved at its national conference in 1992 to demand a national inquiry. Other state Aboriginal organisations were also active during this period.\n\nIn 1994, the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (ALSWA) began soliciting statements from Aboriginal people who had been removed from their families as children or who were parents of removed children. The service interviewed over 600 people during this time and produced a report titled \"Telling our Story\".\n\nThe inquiry was primarily conducted by Sir Ronald Wilson, President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and Mick Dodson, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner.\n\nIndigenous women, appointed as co-commissioners, provided support to the people who gave evidence in each region the inquiry visited. The co-commissioners were: Annette Peardon, Marjorie Thorpe, Dr Maryanne Bin Salik, Sadie Canning, Olive Knight, Kathy Mills, Anne Louis, Laurel Williams, Jackie Huggins, Josephine Ptero-David and Professor Marcia Langton. The co-commissioners also assisted in the development of the report and its recommendations.\n\nThe inquiry also appointed an Indigenous Advisory Council made up of members from all the major regions of Australia. Members of the Council were: Annette Peardon, Brian Butler, Yami Lester, Irene Stainton, Floyd Chermside, Barbara Cummings, Grant Dradge, Carol Kendall, Lola McNaughton, Isabel Coe, Peter Rotimah, Nigel D'Souza, Maureen Abbott, Margaret Ah Kee, Bill Lowah, Matilda House and Jim Wright.\n\nThe inquiry undertook an extensive programme of hearings in every capital city and in many regional and smaller centres.\n\nThe first hearings took place on 4 December 1995 on Flinders Island with the last round of hearings ending on 3 October 1996 in Sydney.\n\nDuring the course of the inquiry 777 submissions were received, which included 535 Indigenous individual and group submissions, 49 church submissions and 7 government submissions.\n\n500 of the submissions were made confidentially.\n\nTwo reports were produced:\n\nThe Community Guide summarised the report's conclusions that \"indigenous families and communities have endured gross violations of their human rights. These violations continue to affect indigenous people's daily lives. They were an act of genocide, aimed at wiping out indigenous families, communities, and cultures, vital to the precious and inalienable heritage of Australia\".\n\nThe report made many recommendations, including that:\n\nFormal apologies have been tabled and passed by the Commonwealth Government, as well as the state parliaments of Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, and Tasmania and the territory parliament of the Northern Territory. It may be that all states have done this because Senator Aden Ridgeway was quoted in 1999 as saying that \"every State Parliament has passed an apology\". Former Prime Minister John Howard issued a statement of regret but resolutely refused to issue a formal apology. He has been quoted many times as refusing to take a black armband view of history. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who succeeded Mr. Howard, tabled a formal apology on 13 February 2008, which was passed unanimously.\n\nOn Thursday 26 August 1999, the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, moved a Motion of Reconciliation, which included an expression of \"deep and sincere regret that indigenous Australians suffered injustices under the practices of past generations, and for the hurt and trauma that many indigenous people continue to feel as a consequence of those practices\". The opposition leader Kim Beazley moved to replace Howard's motion of regret with an unreserved apology, but was unsuccessful.\n\nOn 11 December 2007, the newly elected government of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that an official apology would be made to Indigenous Australians. The wording of the apology would be decided in consultation with Indigenous leaders. On 13 February 2008, at 9:00am (AEDT), Rudd tabled the following apology as the first order of business at the opening of Australia's Parliament in 2008; it was passed unanimously by the members of the lower house at 9:57 a.m.:\n\nOn 27 May 1997, the Western Australian Premier, Richard Court, issued a parliamentary statement using the words: \"It is appropriate that this House show respect for Aboriginal families that have been forcibly separated as a consequence of government policy in the past, by observing a period of silence\". Members stood for one minute silence. The next day the leader of the Western Australian opposition moved: \"that this House apologises to the Aboriginal people on behalf of all Western Australians for the past policies under which Aboriginal children were removed from their families and expresses deep regret at the hurt and distress that this caused\".\n\nOn 28 May 1997, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Dean Brown, issued a parliamentary apology on behalf of the people of South Australia, saying that the \"South Australian Parliament expresses its deep and sincere regret at the forced separation of some Aboriginal children from their families and homes which occurred prior to 1964, apologises to these Aboriginal people for these past actions and reaffirms its support for reconciliation between all Australians\".\n\nOn 17 June 1997, the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, Kate Carnell, moved a motion in the Territory Assembly that included the words: \"that this Assembly apologises to the Ngunnawal people and other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in the ACT for the hurt and distress inflicted upon any people as a result of the separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families\".\n\nOn 18 June 1997, Bob Carr, Premier of New South Wales, issued an apology on behalf of the people of NSW that included the words: \"apologises unreservedly to the Aboriginal people of Australia for the systematic separation of generations of Aboriginal children from their parents, families, and communities\".\n\nOn 13 August 1997, the Tasmanian Premier, Tony Rundle, moved a parliamentary motion that included the words: \"That this Parliament, on behalf of all Tasmanians, expresses its deep and sincere regrets at the hurt and distress caused by past policies under which Aboriginal children were removed from their families and homes, apologises to the Aboriginal people for those past actions and reaffirms its support for reconciliation between all Australians\".\n\nOn 17 September 1997, the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, moved a parliamentary motion that included the words: \"That this House apologises to the Aboriginal people on behalf of all Victorians for the past policies under which Aboriginal children were removed from their families and expresses deep regret at the hurt and distress this has caused and reaffirms its support for reconciliation between all Australians\".\n\nOn 26 May 1999, the Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie, issued a parliamentary statement that included the following words: \"This house recognises the critical importance to Indigenous Australians and the wider community of a continuing reconciliation process, based on an understanding of, and frank apologies for, what has gone wrong in the past and total commitment to equal respect in the future.\"\n\nOn 24 October 2001, the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Clare Martin, moved that the Northern Territory legislative assembly \"apologises to Territorians who were removed from their families under the authority of the Commonwealth Aboriginals Ordinance and placed in institutional or foster care\" and \"calls upon the Commonwealth government to make a formal and specific apology to all those persons removed pursuant to the Aboriginals Ordinance, acknowledging that the Commonwealth failed in discharging its moral obligations towards them\".\n\nThe \"National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families\" sought to provide an opportunity to discover the experiences of people removed from their families. It was anticipated that given the trauma witnesses had experienced that they would be at risk of further trauma if they were to be cross examined on their testimony and their evidence challenged. Acting on this judgment the Report, \"Bringing them Home\" was written on the evidence presented. Among a number of criticisms of the report, also reflected in the arguments of those arguing the impact of the events described were exaggerated or minimising or denying their occurrence this \"failure\" to \"prove the evidence\" was considered critical, a number of other criticisms were made, chief among the critics were John Herron and Ron Brunton.\n\nA number of responses, some critical, responded to the points raised Herron and Brunton. Many of these arguments continue into the present around the formal apology to the Stolen Generations of 13 February 2008.\n\n"}
{"id": "1827917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1827917", "title": "Callippic cycle", "text": "Callippic cycle\n\nFor astronomy and calendar studies, the Callippic cycle (or Calippic) is a particular approximate common multiple of the year (specifically the tropical year) and the synodic month, that was proposed by Callippus during 330 BC. It is a period of 76 years, as an improvement of the 19-year Metonic cycle.\n\nA century before Callippus, Meton had discovered the cycle in which 19 years equals 235 lunations. If we assume a year is about days, 19 years total about 6940 days, which exceeds 235 lunations by almost a third of a day, and 19 tropical years by four tenths of a day. It implicitly gave the solar year a duration of = 365 + = 365 + + days = 365 d 6 h 18 min 56 s. Callippus accepted the 19-year cycle, but held that the duration of the year was more closely days (= 365 d 6 h), so he multiplied the 19-year cycle by 4 to obtain an integer number of days, and then omitted 1 day from the last 19-year cycle. Thus, he computed a cycle of 76 years that consists of 940 lunations and 27,759 days, which has been named the \"Callippic\" cycle after him.\n\nAlthough the cycle's error has been computed as one full day in 553 years, or 4.95 parts per million, in actuality 27,759 days in 76 years has a mean year of exactly days, which relative to the mean northward equinoctial year is about 11 minutes too long per year, in other words the cycle drifts another day late per years, which is considerably worse than the drift of the unrounded Metonic cycle. If the Callippic cycle is considered as closer to its unrounded length of days (based on 940 lunations) then its accuracy is essentially the same as the unrounded Metonic cycle (within a few seconds per year). If it is considered as 940 lunations less one day then the Callippic mean year will be shortened by of a day (18 minutes 57 seconds), making it grossly too short, and it will also grossly drift ahead with respect to the mean lunar cycle at the rate of of a day (1 minute 31 seconds) per lunar month. If the cycle length is truncated to 27,758 days then the mean year is 365 days 5 hours 41 minutes 3 seconds, or almost 8 minutes too brief per year, and it will drift ahead of the mean lunar cycle by about day (1 minute 9 seconds) per lunar month. Altogether, the purported accuracy of this cycle is not impressive, but it is of historical interest.\n\nThe first year of the first Callippic cycle began at the summer solstice of 330 BC (28 June in the proleptic Julian calendar), and was subsequently used by later astronomers. In Ptolemy's \"Almagest\", for example, he cites (\"Almagest\" VII 3, H25) observations by Timocharis during the 47th year of the first Callippic cycle (283 BC), when on the eighth of Anthesterion, the Pleiades star cluster was occulted by the Moon.\n\nThe Callippic calendar originally used the names of months from the Attic calendar. Later astronomers, such as Hipparchus, preferred other calendars, including the ancient Egyptian calendar. Also Hipparchus invented his own Hipparchic calendar cycle as an improvement upon the Callippic cycle. Ptolemy's \"Almagest\" provided some conversions between the Callippic and Egyptian calendars, such as that Anthesterion 8, 47th year of the first Callippic period was equivalent to day 29 of the month of Athyr, during year 465 of Nabonassar. However, the original, complete form of the Callippic calendar is no longer known.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "342230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=342230", "title": "Edith Hamilton", "text": "Edith Hamilton\n\nEdith Hamilton (August 12, 1867 – May 31, 1963) was an American educator and internationally-known author who was one of the most renowned classicists of her era in the United States. A graduate of Bryn Mawr College, she also studied in Germany at the University of Leipzig and the University of Munich. Hamilton began her career as an educator and head of the Bryn Mawr School, a private college preparatory school for girls in Baltimore, Maryland; however, Hamilton is best known for her essays and best-selling books on ancient Greek and Roman civilizations.\n\nHamilton's second career as an author began after her retirement from Bryn Mawr School in 1922. She was sixty-two years old when her first book, \"The Greek Way,\" was published in 1930. It was an immediate success and a featured selection by the Book-of-the-Month Club in 1957. Hamilton's other notable works include \"The Roman Way\" (1932), \"The Prophets of Israel\" (1936), \"Mythology\" (1942), and \"The Echo of Greece\" (1957).\n\nCritics have acclaimed Hamilton's books for their lively interpretations of ancient cultures, and she is described as the classical scholar who \"brought into clear and brilliant focus the Golden Age of Greek life and thought ... with Homeric power and simplicity in her style of writing\". Her works are said to influence modern lives through a \"realization of the refuge and strength in the past\" to those \"in the troubled present.\" Hamilton's younger sister was Alice Hamilton, an expert in industrial toxicology and the first woman appointed to the faculty of Harvard University.\n\nEdith Hamilton, the eldest child of American parents Gertrude Pond (1840–1917) and Montgomery Hamilton (1843–1909), was born on August 12, 1867, in Dresden, Germany. Shortly after her birth, the Hamilton family returned to the United States and made their home in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where Edith's grandfather, Allen Hamilton, had settled in the early 1820s. Edith spent her youth among her extended family in Fort Wayne.\n\nEdith's grandfather, Allen Hamilton, was an Irish immigrant who came to Indiana in 1823 by way of Canada and settled in Fort Wayne. In 1828 he married Emerine Holman, the daughter of Indiana Supreme Court Justice Jesse Lynch Holman. Allen Hamilton became a successful Fort Wayne businessman and a land speculator. Much of the city of Fort Wayne was built on land he once owned. The Hamilton family's large estate on a three-block area of downtown Fort Wayne included three homes. The family also built a home at Mackinac Island, Michigan, where they spent many of their summers. For the most part, the second and third generations of the extended Hamilton family, which included Edith's family, as well as her uncles, aunts, and cousins, lived on inherited wealth.\n\nMontgomery Hamilton, a scholarly man of leisure, was one of Allen and Emerine (Holman) Hamilton's eleven children; however, only five of the siblings lived. Her father attended Princeton University and Harvard Law School and also studied in Germany. Montgomery met Gertrude Pond, the daughter of a wealthy Wall Street broker and sugar importer, while living in Germany. They were married in 1866. Montgomery Hamilton became a partner in a wholesale grocery business in Fort Wayne, but the partnership dissolved in 1885 and the business failure caused a financial loss for the family. Afterwards, Montgomery Hamilton retreated from public life. Edith's mother, Gertrude, who loved modern literature and spoke several languages, remained socially active in the community and had \"wide cultural and intellectual interests.\" After the failure of her father's business, Edith realized that she would need to provide a livelihood for herself and decided to become an educator.\n\nEdith was the oldest of five siblings that included three sisters (Alice (1869-1970), Margaret (1871-1969), and Norah (1873-1945)) and a brother (Arthur \"Quint\" (1886-1967)), all of whom were accomplished in their respective fields. Edith became an educator and renowned author; Alice became a founder of industrial medicine; Margaret, like her older sister, Edith, became an educator and headmistress at Bryn Mawr School; and Norah was an artist. Hamilton's youngest sibling, Arthur, was nineteen years her junior. He became a writer, professor of Spanish, and assistant dean for foreign students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Arthur was the only sibling to marry; he and his wife, Mary Neal (d. 1965), had no children.\n\nBecause Edith's parents disliked the public school system's curriculum, they taught their children at home. As she once described him, \"My father was well-to-do, but he wasn't interested in making money; he was interested in making people use their minds.\" Edith, who learned to read at an early age, became an excellent storyteller. Hamilton credited her father for guiding her towards studies of the classics; he began teaching her Latin when she was seven years old. Her father also introduced her to Greek language and literature, where her mother taught the Hamilton children French and had them tutored in German.\n\nIn 1884 Edith began two years of study at Miss Porter's Finishing School for Young Ladies (now known as Miss Porter's School) in Farmington, Connecticut, where attendance was a family tradition for the Hamilton women. Three of Hamilton's aunts, three cousins, and her three sisters attended the school.\n\nHamilton returned to Indiana in 1886 and began four years of preparation prior to her acceptance at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1891. She majored in Greek and Latin and was awarded a bachelor of arts and a master of arts degree in 1894. Hamilton spent the year after her graduation as a fellow in Latin at Bryn Mawr College and was awarded the Mary E. Garrett European Fellowship, the college's highest honor. The cash award from Bryn Mawr provided funds to enable Edith and Alice, who had completed her medical degree at the University of Michigan in 1893, to pursue further studies in Germany for an academic year. Hamilton became the first woman to enroll at the University of Munich.\n\nIn the fall of 1895 the Hamilton sisters departed for Germany, where Alice intended to continue her studies in pathology at the University of Leipzig and Edith planned to study the classics and attend lectures. At that time, most North American women, including Edith and Alice, registered as auditors for their classes. When the sisters arrived in Leipzig, they found a fair number of foreign women studying at the university. They were informed that women could attend lectures, but they were expected to remain \"invisible\" and would not be allowed to participate in discussions.\n\nAccording to Alice, \"Edith was extremely disappointed with the lectures she attended.\" Although they were thorough, the lectures \"lost sight of the beauty of literature by focusing on obscure grammatical points.\" As a result, they decided to enroll at the University of Munich, but it was not much of an improvement. Initially, it was uncertain whether Edith would be allowed to audit lectures, but she was granted permission to do so, albeit under trying conditions. According to Alice, when Edith arrived at her first class, she was escorted to the lecture platform and seated in a chair beside the lecturer, facing the audience, \"so that nobody would be contaminated by contact with her.\" Edith is quoted as saying, \"the head of the University used to stare at me, then shake his head and say sadly to a colleague, 'There now, you see what's happened? We're right in the midst of the woman question.'\"\n\nHamilton intended to remain in Munich, Germany, to earn a doctoral degree, but her plans changed after Martha Carey Thomas, president of Bryn Mawr College, persuaded Hamilton to return to the United States. In 1896 Hamilton became head administrator of Bryn Mawr School. Founded in 1885 as a college preparatory school for girls in Baltimore, Maryland, Bryn Mawr School was the country's only private high school for women that prepared all of its students for collegiate coursework. The school's students were required to pass Bryn Mawr College's entrance exam as a requirement for graduation.\n\nAlthough Hamilton never completed her doctorate, she did become an \"inspiring and respected head of the school\" and was revered as an outstanding teacher of the classics, along with being an effective and successful administrator. She enhanced student life, maintained its high academic standards, and offered new ideas. Hamilton was unafraid to suggest new initiatives such as having her school's basketball team compete against another girls' team from a nearby boarding school. The proposed athletic competition was considered a scandalous suggestion for the time because news coverage would include the names of the participants. After Hamilton convinced the local press not to cover the event, the games proceeded and it became an annual tradition.\n\nIn 1906, Hamilton's accomplishments as an educator and administrator were recognized when she was named the first headmistress in the school's history. Hamilton, who believed in providing students with a \"rigorous\" curriculum, successfully transitioned the girls school from its \"mediocre beginnings into one of the foremost preparatory institutions in the country.\" Her insistence on offering challenging standards to the students and different options on school policies led to confrontations with Dean Thomas. As Hamilton became increasingly frustrated with the situation at the school, her health also declined. She retired in 1922 at the age of fifty-four, after twenty-six years of service to the school.\n\nAfter retiring as an educator in 1922 and moving to New York City in 1924, Hamilton began a second career as an author of essays and best-selling books on ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. She had studied Greek and Latin from her youth and it remained her lifelong interest. \"I came to the Greeks early,\" Hamilton told an interviewer when she was ninety-one, \"and I found answers in them. Greece's great men let all their acts turn on the immortality of the soul. We don't really act as if we believed in the soul's immortality and that's why we are where we are today.\"\n\nFor more than fifty years her \"love affair with Greece had smoldered without literary outlet\". At the suggestion of Rosamund Gilder, editor of \"Theater Arts Monthly,\" Hamilton began by writing essays about Greek drama and comedies. Several of her early articles were published in \"Theater Arts Monthly\" before she began writing the series of books on ancient Greek and Roman life for which she is most noted. Hamilton went on to become America's most renowned classicist of her era.\n\nAccording to her biographer, Barbara Sicherman, Hamilton's life was \"ruled by a passionately nonconformist vision\" that was also the source of her \"strength and vitality\" as well as her \"appeal as public figure and author.\" However, Hamilton was not, and did not claim to be, a scholar. She did not attempt to present excessive detailed facts from the past. Instead, Hamilton focused on readability and uncovering \"truths of the spirit,\" which she found from ancient writers. Drawing from Greek, Roman, Hebrew, and early Christian writings, Hamilton put into words what ancient people were like by concentrating on what they wrote about their own lives. Using the qualities and styles of the ancient writers, she emulated their directness, strived for perfection, and did not include footnotes.\n\nHamilton was sixty-two when her first book, \"The Greek Way\", was published in 1930 and is considered by some as her most honored work, The successful book, which Hamilton wrote at the urging of Elling Annestad, an editor at W. W. Norton Company, made her a well-known author in the United States. The bestseller drew comparisons between ancient Greece and modern-day life with essays about some of the great figures of Athenian history and literature. Critically praised for its \"vivid and graceful prose,\" the book brought Hamilton immediate acclaim and established her reputation as a scholar. Biographer Robert Kanigel states that \"\"The Greek Way\" renders the ancient Greek mind accessible to the modern reader. It serves up a delectable appetizer of Greek civilization that leaves you begging for the rest of the meal. It is a work of popularization of the highest order.\"\n\nIn Hamilton's view, Greek civilization at its peak represented a \"flowering of the mind\" that has yet to be equaled in the history of the world. \"The Greek Way\" showed that the Greeks recognized and appreciated such things as love, athletic games, love of knowledge, fine arts, and intelligent conversation. In \"East and West,\" the first of the book's twelve chapters, Hamilton described the differences between the West and the Eastern nations which preceded it. One book reviewer noted that the Greeks, which Hamilton considered the first Westerners, challenged Eastern ways that \"remained the same throughout the ages, forever remote from all that is modern.\" Hamilton further suggested that the modern spirit of the West was \"a Greek discovery, and the place of the Greeks is in the modern world.\"\n\nMore recent writers have used Hamilton's observations in contrasting the civilizations and cultures of the East with that of the West. In comparing ancient Egypt with Greece, for instance, Hamilton's writing describes the unique geography, climate, agriculture, and government. Historian James Golden cites from \"The Greek Way\" that \"Egyptian society was preoccupied with death.\" Its pharaohs erected giant monuments to themselves to impress future generations and its priests advised the slaves to \"look forward to an afterlife.\" Golden used Hamilton's research to contrast these differences with the Greeks, especially the Athenians. Hamilton argued that individual \"perfection of mind and body\" dominated Greek thought and as a result, the Greeks \"excelled at philosophy and sports\" and that life \"in all its exuberant potential\" was the hallmark of Greek civilization.\n\n\"The Roman Way\" (1932), her second book, provided similar contrasts between ancient Rome and present-day life. It was also a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1957. Hamilton described life as it existed according to ancient Roman poets such as Plautus, Virgil and Juvenal, interpreted Roman thought and manners, and compared them to people's lives in the twentieth century. She also suggested how Roman ideas applied to the modern world.\n\nAlthough her books were successful and popular among readers, she conceded \"that it was hopeless to persuade Americans to be Greeks\" and that \"life had become far too complex since the age of Pericles to recapture the simple directness of Greek life ... the calm lucidity of the Greek mind, which convinced the great thinkers of Athens of their mastery of truth and enlightenment.\"\n\nHer books later covered other areas of interest, especially from the Bible. In 1936 Hamilton wrote \"The Prophets of Israel\" (Norton, 1936), which interpreted the beliefs of the \"spokesmen for God\" in the Old Testament. With no knowledge of the Hebrew language, she relied on English language versions of the Bible to similarly compare the achievements and personal lives of the prophets with those of twentieth-century readers. She concludes that the prophets were practical and their political views reflected their time, but their ideals were modern.\n\nHamilton also summarized the importance of that connection to people in modern times: \"Love and grief and joy remain the same forever beautiful\" and \"poetic truth is always true\" as are truths of the spirit. \"The prophets understand them as no men have more, and in their pages we can find ourselves. Our aspirations are there, our desires for humanity.\" American historian Bruce Catton noted the prophets, whose \"religion was an affair of the workaday world,\" and their messages that Hamilton described in her \"excellent book\" are still as relevant today. A subsequent edition of the book, \"Spokesmen for God: The Great Teachers of the Old Testament\" (Norton, 1949), supplied additional commentary on the first five books of the Old Testament. Christian Science historian Robert Peel described it as \"a work of sheer delight.\"\n\nJohn Mason Brown, American drama critic, praised Hamilton's \"The Greek Way\", placing it at the top among modern-day written about ancient Greece,\" and \"Mythology\" as \"incomparably superior to Thomas Bulfinch's work on the subject. Hamilton's \"Mythology\" (1941), recounts the stories of classical mythology and ancient fables. She used an approach to mythology that was entirely through the literature of the classics. (She had not traveled to Greece until 1929 and was not an archaeologist.) The book received favorable reviews, was another a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and had sold more than four and a half million copies by 1957.\n\nIn 1942, after moving to Washington, D.C., Hamilton continued to write. At the age of eighty-two she offered new perspectives on the New Testament in \"Witness to the Truth: Christ and His Interpreters\" (1948) and produced a sequel to \"The Greek Way\", titled \"The Echo of Greece\" (1957). The sequel to her first book discusses the political ideas of such teachers and leaders as Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, and Alexander the Great.\n\nHamilton continued traveling and lecturing in her eighties, and wrote articles, reviews, and translations of Greek plays, including \"The Trojan Women,\", \"Prometheus Bound,\" and \"Agamemnon.\" She also edited \"The Collected Dialogues of Plato\" (1961).\n\nDoris Fielding Reid (September 4, 1895 – January 16, 1973) was an American stockbroker. She was the daughter of Harry Fielding Reid, an American geophysicist, and Edith Gittings Reid, biographer of Doctor William Osler and President Woodrow Wilson. She was a student of Edith Hamilton. Reid was employed by Loomis, Sayles and Company beginning in 1929. Reid and Hamilton became lifelong companions. They lived together in Gramercy Park, Manhattan and Sea Wall, Maine, during which time they raised and home-schooled Reid's nephew, Francis Dorian Fielding Reid (1917-1973). After Hamilton's death, Reid published the book \"Edith Hamilton: An Intimate Portrait\" (1967). Reid died on January 15, 1973, in Lenox Hill, New York. Both women are buried at Cove Cemetery in Hadlyme, Connecticut.\n\nHamilton and Doris Reid remained in New York City until 1943, then moved to Washington, D.C., and spent their summers in Maine. In Washington, Reid was in charge of the local offices of Loomis, Sayles and Company, an investment firm that had been her employer since 1929; Hamilton continued to write and frequently entertained friends, fellow writers, government representatives, and other dignitaries at her home. Among the eminent and famous were Isak Dinesen, Robert Frost, Harvard classicist Werner Jaeger and labor leader John L. Lewis.\n\nAfter her move to Washington, Hamilton became a commentator on education projects and began to receive honors for her work. Hamilton also recorded programs for television programs and Voice of America, traveled to Europe, and continued to write books, articles, essays, and book reviews.\nHamilton considered the high point of her life to be a trip to Greece at age 90 in 1957, where, in Athens, she saw her translation of Aeschylus's \"Prometheus Bound\" performed at the ancient Odeon theater of Herodes Atticus. As part of the evening's ceremonies, King Paul of Greece awarded the Golden Cross of the Order of Benefaction — one of Greece's highest honors — to her. The mayor of Athens made her an honorary citizen of the city. The US news media, including \"Time\" magazine, covered the event. An article in \"Publishers Weekly\" described the event in Hamilton's honor: floodlights illuminated the Parthenon, the Temple of Zeus and, for the first time in history, the Stoa. Hamilton called the ceremony \"the proudest moment of my life.\"\n\nMany of the facts in \"The Greek Way\" (1930) have surprised modern readers. One reviewer in Australia explained Hamilton's view \"that the spirit of our age is a Greek discovery, and that the Greeks were really the first Westerners, and the first intellectualists.\" The same reviewer also credited the book with noting that modern concepts of play and sport were actually common activities to the Greeks, who engaged in exercise and athletic events, including games, races, and music, dancing, and wrestling competitions, among others.\n\nAmong those whose lives were influenced by Hamilton's writings was U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy. In the months after his brother, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated, Robert was consumed with grief. Former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy gave him a copy of \"The Greek Way,\" which she felt was certain to help him. Political commentator David Brooks reported that Hamilton's essays helped him better understand and then recover from his brother's tragic death. Hamilton's writings remained important to him over time, as Brooks explains, and changed Kennedy's life. \"He carried his beaten, underlined and annotated copy around with him for years, reading sections aloud to audiences in a flat, unrhythmic voice with a mournful edge\" and could recite from memory various passages of Aeschylus that Hamilton had translated.\n\nAccording to reviewers, Hamilton's \"The Prophets of Israel\" (1936) had similarities to her earlier books about Greeks and Romans by making the prophets' messages relevant to contemporary readers. She accomplishes this, according to one writer, by showing that \"behind all great thought stands an individual mind, fired by passion and possessed of an eye that sees deeply into humanity.\" The views of the prophets, it adds, are very similar to those in modern times: \"The prophets were forerunners of three genuinely American movementshumanism, pragmatism and the philosophy of common sense.\"\n\nHamilton died in Washington, D.C. on May 31, 1963, at the age of nearly ninety-six. Four years after her death, Doris Fielding Reid published \"Edith Hamilton: An Intimate Portrait.\" As of 2017 the memoir remains the only full-length biography of Hamilton. Reid died on January 15, 1973. Both women are buried at Cove Cemetery in Hadlyme, Connecticut, where Hamilton's sisters had retired, in the same cemetery as Hamilton's mother (Gertrude) and her sisters (Alice, Norah, and Margaret), and Margaret's life partner, Clara Landsberg. Hamilton's adopted son, Dorian, a graduate of from Amherst College, where he earned a degree in chemistry, died at West Lafayette, Indiana, in January 2008, at the age of ninety.\n\nHamilton was long recognized as a great classicist of her era. Her best-selling books were especially noteworthy for their accessibility to a wide readership and for \"representing the Greeks in particular as a prestigious source of cultural inspiration for American society during the decade before and the two decades after World War II.\"\n\nAlthough Hamilton's reputation as an author is closely tied to her writings about Greece, much of her professional life focused on Latin. Hamilton \"claimed special expertise in Greek,\" but after her graduation from Bryn Mawr College, where she majored in Greek and Latin, she spent another year at the college as a fellow in Latin and another year studying Latin in Germany. Hamilton also taught Latin to girls in the senior class during her twenty-six-year career at Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore. However, with the exception of \"The Roman Way\", Hamilton's written works primarily focused on fourth and fifth century BC Athens. Hamilton's correspondence and papers are held at the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College.\n\nIn 1906 Hamilton became the first headmistress of the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nIn 1950 Hamilton received an honorary degrees of Doctor of Letters from the University of Rochester and the University of Pennsylvania. She was also the recipient of an honorary degree from Yale University in 1960. In addition, Hamilton was elected to the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1955 and the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1957.\n\nHamilton received the National Achievement Award in 1951 as a distinguished classical scholar and author. She received the award along with Anna M. Rosenberg, Assistant Secretary of Defense. The award was created in 1930 to honor women of accomplishment and inspire others.\n\nHamilton was awarded the Golden Cross of the Order of Benefaction, Greece's highest honor, and became an honorary citizen of the city in 1957.\n\nIn 1957 and 1958 she was interviewed by NBC television, and in 1957 \"The Greek Way\" and \"The Roman Way\" were selected by the Book of the Month Club as summer readings. John F. Kennedy invited her to his inauguration, which she declined. He also sent an emissary to her home asking for advice about a new cultural center.\n\nIn 1958 the Women's National Book Association awarded her for her contribution to American culture through books. George V. Allen, director of the United States Information Agency (USIA) and one of the speakers at the award ceremony, remarked that her interpretation of the democratic spirit of ancient Greece, defined \"the fundamental of the democratic ideal itself.\" He also noted that USIA included seven of her books in its overseas libraries in order to help people of other countries interpret American ideals.\n\nShe is the subject of a biography by Doris Fielding Reid, \"Edith Hamilton: An Intimate Portrait\".\n\nOn April 4, 1968, while attending a campaign rally in Indianapolis, Indiana, on the eve of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy quoted from Hamilton's translated works \"in what is perhaps his most memorable speech.\" Kennedy quoted from memory several lines from Hamilton's translation of Aeschylus's tragedy, \"Agamemnon\", telling the grief-stricken crowd: \"In our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.\" Kennedy also incorporated another line from Hamilton's writing, \"her representation of an ancient Greek inscription\" in his closing remarks to the crowd: \"Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago––to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.\" According to classicist Joseph Casazza, that line about \"taming the savageness of man\" was created by Hamilton herself and has no direct relation to a single ancient text. Based on his research, Casazza believes that the phrase is a combination of a line from a 125 B.C. decree about Athens by Delphi and another line from \"On the Character of Thucydides\" by Dionysius of Halicarnassus.\n\nIn 2000 the city of Fort Wayne, Indiana, erected statues of two Hamilton sisters, Edith and Alice, along with their cousin, Agnes, in the city's Headwaters Park.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a member organisation of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience.\n\nThe Center considers the resistance to be the Lithuanian nationalist partisans during World War II who fought communist partisans. This includes fascist groups such as the Lithuanian Activist Front. One anti-Soviet partisan controversially honored by the center is , who led the extermination of the Jews in the city of Plungė. The Centre recommends former members of resistance for larger state pensions and other awards.\n\nThe Center is a strong advocate of the \"Lithuanian genocide thesis\" and sees itself as a \"guardian\" of Lithuanian memory. The Center uses a broadened definition of \"genocide\" including the targeting of social, political, and economic groups by Stalin. The center declares an equivalence between Nazi and Soviet crimes, this \"double genocide\" formulation is common in Eastern Europe, particularly the Baltic States. However in practice the Nazi genocide of the Jews and Lithuanian collaboration is minimized, while the \"genocide\" of Lithuanians by Soviet partisans is described extensively. One plaque at the Genocide Center says that these partisans were “mostly of Jewish nationality [since] native people didn’t support Soviet partisans.” \n\nIn 1998, Lithuania passed a law restricting employment in the public sector for former employees of the KGB, the MGB, and other Soviet security institutions. The centre and the State Security Department had the authority to determine whether a person was an employee of the KGB. In 2002, commemorating the 30th anniversary of Romas Kalanta's self-immolation, Seimas listed May 14 as the Civil Resistance Day () based on recommendations by the centre.\n\nThe centre publishes the journal \"Genocidas ir rezistencija\". One of its long-term research projects is a database and multi-volume publication of names and biographies of the victims of the Soviet and Nazi persecutions. In 2001–2001, the centre handled some 22,000 applications for compensation from the Foundation \"Remembrance, Responsibility and Future\".\n\nThe centre operates the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights in the former prison of KGB in Vilnius and memorial at the Tuskulėnai Manor. Prior to 2018 the museum was known as \"the Museum of Genocide Victims\" reflecting a broadened definition of the term \"genocide\" used by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre, even tough these events considered a genocide only by few historians. Only a small part of the museum space, a small room added in 2011 following international criticism, is devoted to the Holocaust in Lithuania, the event that is universally considered a genocide. According to Dovid Katz, the museum is \"a 21st-century version of Holocaust denial.\". In 2018, the museum was renamed to the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights.\n\nThe Centre has been active in seeking the prosecution of Jewish partisans on the grounds of war crimes. In 1999–2002, the centre was involved in legal proceedings regarding Nachman Dushanski, an Israeli citizen. In 2007 the head of the Genocide Center at the time, Arvydas Anusauskas, initiated a criminal investigation against Holocaust survivor Yitzhak Arad who headed the The International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania. The investigation, which derailed the work of the international commission whose members resigned in protest, was viewed internationally as a \"contemptible farce\", an attempt to erase Lithuanian's history of collaboration with the Nazis, and victim blaming, particularly due to the lack of prosecution of the many Lithuanian Nazi collaborators.\n\nThe centre's director is nominated by the Prime Minister of Lithuania and confirmed by the Seimas (Lithuanian parliament).\nOn November 26, 1992, Juozas Starkauskas was approved by the Lithuanian government to be the acting head of the centre.\nOn 17 February 1994 the Seimas appointed Vytautas Skuodis general director of the reorganized centre.\nOn 18 February 1997 Dalia Kuodytė was appointed general director.\nIn 2009, the Seimas confirmed Birutė Burauskaitė, a dissident of long standing, as the Center's director.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8034203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8034203", "title": "Greek mythology in western art and literature", "text": "Greek mythology in western art and literature\n\nWith the rediscovery of classical antiquity in the Renaissance, the poetry of Ovid became a major influence on the imagination of poets and artists, and remained a fundamental influence on the diffusion and perception of Greek mythology through subsequent centuries. From the early years of the Renaissance, artists portrayed subjects from Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Among the best-known subjects of Italian artists are Botticelli's \"Birth of Venus\" and \"Pallas and the Centaur\", the Ledas of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, and Raphael's \"Galatea\". Through the medium of Latin and the works of Ovid, Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as Petrarch, Boccaccio and Dante in Italy.\n\nIn northern Europe, Greek mythology never took the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature. Both Latin and Greek classical texts were translated, so that stories of mythology became available. In England, Chaucer, the Elizabethans and John Milton were among those influenced by Greek myths; nearly all the major English poets from Shakespeare to Robert Bridges turned for inspiration to Greek mythology. Jean Racine in France and Goethe in Germany revived Greek drama. Racine reworked the ancient myths — including those of Phaidra, Andromache, Oedipus and Iphigeneia — to new purpose.\n\nIn the 18th century, the philosophical revolution of the Enlightenment spread throughout Europe. It was accompanied by a certain reaction against Greek myth; there was a tendency to insist on the scientific and philosophical achievements of Greece and Rome. The myths, however, continued to provide an important source of raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for Handel's operas \"Admeto\" and \"Semele\", Mozart's \"Idomeneo\", and Gluck's \"Iphigénie en Aulide\". By the end of the century, Romanticism initiated a surge of enthusiasm for all things Greek, including Greek mythology. In Britain, it was a great period for new translations of Greek tragedies and Homer's works, and these in turn inspired contemporary poets, such as Keats, Byron, and Shelley. The Hellenism of Queen Victoria's poet laureate, Alfred Lord Tennyson, was such that even his portraits of the quintessentially English court of King Arthur are suffused with echoes of the Homeric epics. The visual arts kept pace, stimulated by the purchase of the Parthenon marbles in 1816; many of the \"Greek\" paintings of Lord Leighton and Lawrence Alma-Tadema were seriously accepted as part of the transmission of the Hellenic ideal.\n\nAmerican authors of the 19th century, such as Thomas Bulfinch and Nathaniel Hawthorne, believed that myths should provide pleasure, and held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of English and American literature. According to Bulfinch, \"The so-called divinities of Olympus have not a single worshipper among living men. They belong now not to the department of theology, but to those of literature and taste.\" In more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by such major dramatists as Jean Anouilh, Jean Cocteau, and Jean Giraudoux in France, Eugene O'Neill in America, and T. S. Eliot in England, and by great novelists such as the Irish James Joyce and the French André Gide. Richard Strauss, Jacques Offenbach and many others have set Greek mythological themes to music.\n\n"}

Her parents were the African American author Charles Chesnutt, said to be the first important black American novelist, and Susan Perry.\n\nHelen Maria Chesnutt attended Smith College with her sister, Ethel, living off-campus as did Otelia Cromwell, the only other black student attending Smith College at this time. The Chesnutt sisters moved to four different addresses during their time at Smith: boarding houses at 95 West Street (1st year), 10 Green Street (2nd year), 36 Green Street (3rd year), and as seniors at 30 Green Street.\n\nA diary entry by English Professor Mary Jordan gives a glimpse of the sisters' experiences at Smith College, which appear not to have been happy. She wrote that the \"Chesnutt girls are having a hard time with the color line...\".\n\nIn 1902 Helen Chesnutt graduated with a B.A. from Smith College, only a year after Otelia Cromwell became the college's first African American graduate, but it was not until 1925 that she would earn an M.A. in Latin from Columbia University.\n\nHelen Chesnutt taught Latin for many years at Central High School in Cleveland, Ohio, including to the poet Langston Hughes, who found her inspiring. For Virgil's 2,000 birthday she put on a play involving the whole school and published a report of the production in the Classical Journall. She said that: \"Roman costumes were gay in color, a fact which seemed to surprise the pupils, who were accustomed to think of them as made of white marble. The dresses and scarfs and tunics had to be dyed, and so the laundry classes spent some days in dyeing and tinting the garments. Their great achievement was a royal toga for Augustus to wear, dyed a perfect Roman purple and stenciled in gold.\"\n\n\"During that hour the pupils of this cosmopolitan high school, situated in the downtown district of a great city, hemmed in on all sides by acres of scrapped automo- biles rusting in heaps, and enveloped by the smoke and grime of a great railroad system not far distant, in a neighborhood where the guns of gangsters can be heard roaring day and night, were transported to another age, walked hand in hand with beauty and romance, and were made to feel that poetry and music and art were precious and that human aspiration was indeed worth while. This is what the celebration of the Bimillennium Vergilianum did for the two thousand pupils of this high school, and they have drunk a draft of inspiration that will remain with them forever.\"\n\nShe co-authored, with Martha Olivenbaum and Nellie Rosebaugh, a beginners Latin textbook entitled \"The Road to Latin\" (1932), which was published in 1932, republished in 1938, 1945 and 1949, and received several positive reviews. The book and teaching methods, which relied on oral presentation of Latin, intensive rather than extensive reading, and a paraphrase method, were discussed and appraised positively in research into teaching of Latin in the US at that time. One reviewer noted that original edition had a \"plain cover, on which the title is lettered in black together with a cameo-like oval in gilt showing a slave taking two Roman boys to school.\"\n\nHelen Chesnutt was elected to the Executive Committee of the American Philological Association in 1920, remaining an active member until 1934.\n\nHer biography of her father, Charles Chesnutt, remains an important source of information about this author.\n\nIn 2018 she featured in an exhibition at the Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington DC celebrating the role of African American's within classics, whose important contributions to the discipline have often been ignored by historians.

In the essay Hayden coins the term Historiophoty to describe the \"representation of history and our thought about it in visual images and filmic discourse\". Hayden says historiophoty \"..is in contrast to Historiography which is the representation of history in verbal images and written discourse,\".\n\nHayden originally coined the term as a rhetorical device in response to an essay by Robert A. Rosenstone in the same issue of \"AHR\" entitled \"History in images/History in words: Reflections on the possibility of really putting history onto film\". Hayden, for the sake of exploring Rosenstone's premise (that history can be portrayed on film), created the term historiophoty as a description of the study of history through film. White was not necessarily claiming that historiophoty exists, or that it ought to; his essay was a thought experiment on what historiophoty would be like if in fact such a thing did exist.\n\nWhatever Hayden's intention, since the publication of his 1988 essay the word historiophoty has entered into public and professional discourse.

{"id": "9733749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9733749", "title": "Jacob the Dacian", "text": "Jacob the Dacian\n\nJacob the Dacian (Spanish: Jacobo Daciano; Latin: Iacobus de Dacia; c. 1484 in Copenhagen, Denmark – 1566 in Michoacán, New Spain) was a Danish-born Franciscan monk. He achieved fluency in eight languages and fame among the indigenous people of Michoacán as a righteous and helpful man toward his flock. His relics, now lost, were kept for a long time by the Indians of Tarécuato who still celebrate his birthday every year. Jacob has been identified as a son of King John of Denmark.\n\nThe translation of his name into Medieval Latin as \"Iacobus de Dacia\" stems from the fact that, during the Middle Ages, the toponym \"Dania\", meaning Denmark, was occasionally confused with \"Dacia\".\n\nBrother Jacob also went by the name \"Iacobus Gottorpius\", referring to the royal estate of Gottorp (now located in Germany).\n\nDanish historian Jørgen Nybo Rasmussen (Rasmussen 1974, 1986) has asserted that Jacob was a son (possibly extramarital) of King John of the Kalmar Union and a younger brother of King Christian II, both Danes. This has not been mentioned by all historians but is also the basis for a novel \"Brother Jacob\" by Danish author Henrik Stangerup. Key arguments in a case for Jacob's royal lineage are the facts that he described himself as coming from Gottorp, the estate of Kings Christian I and John of Denmark; that he had an excellent education normally reserved for the higher nobility; and that he seemed to enjoy the protection of higher political forces. It was also common for younger sons of royalty to enter into the clergy, since they normally would not inherit the thrones. Jacob's position as an inter-continental missionary would have been very unusual for a royal prince.\n\nA number of modern authors have counted Jacob – or \"James\" – as a Danish-Norwegian-Swedish prince and one of the legitimate children of King John and Queen Christina, but Rasmussen's thesis was also met with scepticism. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark visited his burial site, in respect to Jacob being a famous brother of one of her House of Oldenburg ancestors and predecssors, while on a state visit to Mexico in 2006.\n\nEntering the Franciscan Order as a young man, Jacob received a good education studying Latin, Greek and Hebrew as well as his mother tongues German and Danish. In the years prior to the reformation he lived in a convent in Malmö (now in Sweden), where he argued against the Lutheran leaders. In 1530 the Fransciscans were driven from the convent, as they were in the following from the other Danish towns. He described this in the \"Chronicle of the expulsion of the Greyfriars\", written to serve as evidence in a potential trial to attempt to reclaim the convents later. Such a trial never came. During the religious wars known as the Count's Feud, fought between the supporters of his deposed brother, the Catholic King Christian II, and the forces of King Christian III of Denmark, many Franciscans left Denmark and went to Catholic provinces in northern Germany.\n\nJacob stayed in Denmark until the fall of Malmö in 1536 when the region's Lutheran Reformation was completed and the proscription of Mendicant orders forced him into exile. First he went to Mecklenburg under the protection of Duke Albrecht who had fought on the Catholic side in the civil war. Here he was made the last \"Provincial\" (head) of the Franciscan province of Dacia, whence his name. He subsequently went to Spain where he studied the Arabic language and was authorized by King Charles V of Spain to go to New Spain as a missionary.\n\nIn 1542, Brother Jacob arrived in Veracruz, and was to remain in New Spain for the rest of his life, learning several indigenous languages and founding several convents. He spent three years at the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco studying Nahuatl before being sent to Michoacán to work among the Purépecha, where the bulk of his missionary work was done. He learned the Purépecha language and worked ardently to improve \"Indian\" rights, causing problems with the colonial authorities and with local church leadership, alike. He wrote a treatise, \"Declamacion del pueblo barbaro de los Indios, que habiendo recibido el bautismo, desean recibir los demas sacramentos\", in which he argued that \"Indians\" should be allowed to be ordained into the priesthood. In this question he was overruled by church authorities and had to do penitence for these actions – he had claimed that denying \"Indians\" the right to ordination was in fact tantamount to heresy, a standpoint which has been vindicated in the modern Roman Catholic Church.\n\nHe died in the convent of Tarécuato, in the bishopric of Zamora where he had served as a guardian. Beginning in 1996, attempts have been made toward his canonization.\n\n"}

He was a member of the Russian Academy of Science.\n\nRostovtzeff was the son of a Latin teacher. Upon completing his studies at the universities of Kiev and , Rostovtsev served as an assistant and then as a full Professor of Latin at the 1898–1918. In 1918, following the Russian Revolution, he emigrated first to Sweden, then to England, and finally in 1920 to the United States. There he accepted a chair at the University of Wisconsin–Madison before moving to Yale University in 1925 where he taught until his retirement in 1944. He oversaw all archaeological activities of the latter institution in general and the excavations of Dura-Europos in particular. He is believed to have coined the term \"caravan city\".\n\nWhile working in Russia, Rostovtzeff became an authority on the ancient history of South Russia and Ukraine. He summed up his knowledge on the subject in \"Iranians and Greeks in South Russia\" (1922) and \"Skythien und der Bosporus\" (1925). His most important archaeological findings at Yale were described in \"Dura-Europos and Its Art\" (1938).\n\nGlen Bowersock described Rostovtzeff's views as having been largely formed by the age of thirty, developing mainly only in the quality of execution in later life, and making him \"the last of the nineteenth-century ancient historians\". Rostovtzeff was known as a proud and slightly overpowering man who did not fit in easily. In later life, he suffered from depression.\n\nRostovtzeff was notable for his theories of the cause of the collapse of the Roman Empire which he expounded in detail in his magisterial \"The Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire\" (1926). Scarred by his experience of fleeing from the Russian Revolution, he attributed the collapse of the Roman Empire to an alliance between the rural proletariat and the military in the third century A.D. Despite not being a Marxist himself, Rostovtzeff used terms such as proletariat, bourgeoisie and capitalism freely in his work and the importation of those terms into a description of the ancient world, where they did not necessarily apply, caused criticism.\n\nRostovtzeff's theory was quickly understood as one based on the author's own experiences and equally quickly rejected by the academic community. Bowersock later described the book as \"the marriage of pre-1918 scholarly training and taste with post-1918 personal experience and reflection.\" At the same time, however, the detailed scholarship involved in the production of the work impressed his contemporaries and he was one of the first to merge archaeological evidence with literary sources. Today, Rostovtzeff's theories in this area continue to be rejected by scholars as untenable.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Pritsak began his academic career at the University of Lviv in interwar Poland where he studied Middle Eastern languages under local orientalists and became associated with the Shevchenko Scientific Society and attended its seminar on Ukrainian history led by Ivan Krypiakevych. After the Soviet annexation of Galicia, he moved to Kiev where he briefly studied with the premier Ukrainian orientalist, Ahatanhel Krymsky. During the war, Pritsak escaped to the west. He studied at the universities in Berlin and Göttingen, receiving a doctorate from the latter, before teaching at the University of Hamburg. In the 1960s, he moved to the United States, where he taught at the University of Washington for a while, before moving to Harvard at the invitation of the prominent linguist, Roman Jakobson, who was interested in proving the authenticity of the twelfth century \"Song of Igor\" through the use of oriental sources. At Harvard, he founded the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute (1973), became the first Mykhailo Hrushevsky Professor of Ukrainian History (1975), and started the journal, \"Harvard Ukrainian Studies\" (1977). In 1989, he retired from his Harvard professorship. After the emergence of an independent Ukraine in 1991, Pritsak returned to Kiev where he founded the Oriental Institute of the National Academy of Sciences and the journal \"Skhidnyi svit\" (The Oriental World). He spent his final years back in the United States and died in Boston at the age of 87.\n\nPritsak was a medievalist who specialized in the use of oriental, especially Turkic, sources for the history of Kievan Rus', early modern Ukraine, and the European Steppe region. He was also a student of Old Norse and was familiar with Scandinavian sources for the history of Kievan Rus'. His \"magnum opus\", \"The Origin of Rus\"', only one volume of which has appeared in English (1981), inclines toward, but does not totally adopt, a Normanist interpretation of Rus' origins. He saw Kievan Rus' as a multi-ethnic polity.\n\nIn addition to the early Rus', Pritsak's works focused on Eurasian nomads and steppe empires such as those created by the Bulgars, Khazars, Pechenegs, and Kipchaks. However, he firmly rejected the \"Eurasian\" approach to Ukrainian and Russian history and would have nothing to do with its Russian nationalist postulates.\n\nUnlike his predecessors Mykhailo Hrushevsky, Dmytro Doroshenko, and Ivan Krypiakevych, who wrote national histories or histories of the Ukrainian people, Pritsak followed the Ukrainian historian of Polish background, Viacheslav Lypynsky, in proposing the ideal of writing a \"territorialist\" history of Ukraine that would include the Polish, Turkic, and other peoples who have inhabited the country from ancient times. This idea was later taken up by his younger contemporary Paul Magocsi, who was for some time an associate of the Harvard Ukrainian Institute.\n\nPritsak sought to improve quality and extent of Ukrainian studies at Harvard University. He supported establishing three different chairs for Ukrainian studies in the university: Ukrainian history, Ukrainian literature and Ukrainian philology.\n\nPritsak was a political conservative and during his youth in eastern Galicia under the Polish Republic, and later also during the Cold War was a supporter of the conservative \"Hetmanite\" or monarchist movement among Ukrainians. This led him to criticize Hrushevsky's political radicalism and historical populism, although, ironically, he claimed that Hrushevsky's \"school\" of history was being continued at Harvard. Also during the Cold War, Pritsak became prominent in the movement towards Ukrainian-Jewish reconciliation. Pritsak often was invited to brief Pope John Paul II on developments in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n\n"}

He founded The Polynesian Society.\n\nPercy Smith (as he was known) was born in Beccles, Suffolk, the eldest son of Hannah Hursthouse and John Stephenson Smith, a merchant and later a civil servant. Smith emigrated to New Zealand with his family in February 1850. Percy Smith attended school at New Plymouth and later Omata, leaving to help on the family farm in 1854. Interested in the natural world and the landscape of the Taranaki Region, Smith took lessons in painting from John Gully, a landscape artist. In 1855, aged 14, he joined the provincial survey department, helping to survey the land around New Plymouth, spending long periods in the bush and coming into frequent contact with Māori. Following two years of training, he was made assistant surveyor. While still in his teens, he began a series of expeditions in his spare time, joining a party to scale Mount Taranaki in 1857, for example, and undertaking a journey in 1858 up the Mōkau River to Taupo, Lakes Rotomahana and Tarawera, the Tongariro-Ruapehu area, returning via Rangitikei and Wanganui. This expedition was over 1000 kilometres (600 miles) on foot, horse, and canoe.\n\nDuring his service in the local militia, Smith also witnessed at first hand the conflict leading up to the Taranaki wars. In March 1858 he saw the fighting at Waitara, where he was employed to make sketches of the stockades. In 1859 was transferred to the Auckland district where he worked with the Land Purchase Department, surveying newly acquired government land in the Kaipara and Northern Wairoa. In April 1860 he was instructed to return at once to Kaipara, where he acted as an interpreter and intermediary to persuade Ngāti Whātua to help in the defence of Auckland against a rumoured attack from the Waikato tribes. Smith was then employed in laying out the boundaries of blocks at Coromandel and in the survey of military settlements in the Waikato.\n\nSmith married Mary Anne Crompton on 23 April 1863. They remained in Auckland until 1865, when he was transferred back to Taranaki as district surveyor. There his main duties were the survey of lands confiscated from the Māori. In the following decade, he surveyed territories in various parts of New Zealand. In 1868 he was undertaking a survey of Pitt Islands in the Chathams at the time when Te Kooti escaped on the \"Rifleman\" to Poverty Bay. Smith was appointed the first geodesical surveyor and chief surveyor of the provincial district of Auckland in the department of the surveyor general in 1877 and assistant surveyor-general in 1882. Immediately after the eruption of Mount Tarawera in 1886, he made visits to the region and reported his findings in \"The Eruption of Tarawera\" (1886). Smith reported the Pink and White Terraces could not be located due to the absence of any pre-eruption survey. In 2017 researchers using a forgotten 1859 survey were finally able to map the Pink and White terrace locations.\n\nIn 1887, he joined an expedition to the Kermadec Islands to confirm New Zealand possession and to report on the group, which he did in \"The Kermadec Islands: Their Capabilities and Extent\" (1887). His career as a surveyor reached its peak when he was appointed as Surveyor-General of New Zealand in January 1889.\n\nIn the course of his surveying expeditions, Smith took advantage of any opportunity to collect and record information on the traditional history and culture of the Māori, material which would later form the foundation for his work as a Polynesian scholar. Not until he retired from the civil service was he able to give his unrestricted attention to these studies. By now a recognised scholar of the Māori language, Percy Smith was regarded by his contemporaries as a leading Pākehā authority on Māori history and traditions. To provide a focal point for ethnological research in New Zealand, he called a meeting in Wellington in January 1892 to establish the Polynesian Society, becoming its first secretary and treasurer. He was also the first co-editor of the \"Journal of the Polynesian Society\", alongside Edward Tregear. Smith was to be the main contributor to the \"Journal\" until his death 30 years later, during which time he also published a lengthy series of studies of Māori history. In 1897 undertook a six-month tour of the Pacific, promoting the Polynesian Society and gathering material in support of his thesis regarding the history of the Polynesians. The tour was 'a seminal event' in Smith's ethnological career and he gained access to a number of manuscripts from Rarotonga and other places. Using these manuscripts gathered in Polynesia and other sources from New Zealand, Smith constructed an elaborate history of the Polynesians from a purported Aryan origin in India, a history originally published in volumes 7 and 8 (1898–1899) of the \"Journal of the Polynesian Society\" (Walker et al. 2000:viii-ix). This study was republished in book form as \"Hawaiki, the Original Home of the Maori\" (1921), later reprinted in a number of editions. \"Hawaiki\" had a tremendous impact on the popular view of Māori history, becoming the authorised version until relatively recent times when its authenticity came under scrutiny in the writings of David Simmons (1976) and M.P.K. Sorrensen (1979).\n\nSmith retired in October 1900, and from that time onwards he dedicated himself increasingly to his research, although in 1902 he was appointed as Government Resident in Niue Island after its annexation by New Zealand. He spent five months on Niue, arranging the administrative and legal systems and drafting the constitution. At the same time, however, he gathered material on the ethnology and language of the island for two further publications. In 1904 appeared one of his most enduring studies, \"The Wars of the Northern Against the Southern Tribes\", which was revised as \"The Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century\".\n\nA few years later, Smith published \"History and Traditions of the Maoris of the West Coast, North Island\" (1910), a monumental study of the traditional history of the regions with which he was best acquainted.\n\nHe died at his home in New Plymouth, on 19 April 1922.\n\nThe assessment of Smith's contribution, unreservedly generous at his death, has changed somewhat in recent decades. In 1966, The Encyclopaedia of New Zealand was generally positive, with some qualification. \"His careful recording of traditional material, cross checked as far as possible by varying tribal histories, left an invaluable contribution... Although they can now be amplified or corrected on points of detail, the structure is substantially unchanged. In his studies on Maori origins he was more uncritical and framed hypotheses on what now seems slender linguistic and traditional evidence. The nevertheless high standard, for the period, of his own work and its publication provided a touchstone for later amplification which is being revised only today by more developed archaeological and critical techniques\" (Bagnall 1966:266).\n\nSmith's biography (first published in 1993) in the \"Dictionary of New Zealand Biography\" is more forthright, stating that \"In some areas, particularly his account of the origins of the Maori and their arrival in New Zealand, Smith's interpretation has not survived the light cast on it by later historical and archaeological research. Scholars have criticised Smith's use of his source materials and his editing of Maori traditions for publication... Smith's careers in surveying and ethnology were characterised by hard work and dedication, and he received recognition for both in his lifetime. Although it is now generally accepted that much of his work on the Maori is unreliable, his research nevertheless provided a basis for the development of professional ethnology in New Zealand. As a successful civil servant and respected scholar he was perhaps one of New Zealand's most prolific intellectuals of the late nineteenth century, and was a major contributor to the scientific debate over the origins and nature of the Maori\" (G.M. Byrnes 2006).\n\nHistorian Rāwiri Taonui, writing in 2006 for the website \"\", accuses Smith of falsification: \"The Great Fleet theory was the result of a collaboration between the 19th-century ethnologist S. Percy Smith and the Māori scholar Hoani Te Whatahoro Jury. Smith obtained details about places in Rarotonga and Tahiti during a visit in 1897, while Jury provided information about Māori canoes in New Zealand. Smith then 'cut and pasted' his material, combining several oral traditions into new ones. Their joint work was published in two books, in which Jury and Smith falsely attributed much of their information to two 19th-century tohunga, Moihi Te Mātorohanga and Nēpia Pōhūhū\" (Taonui 2006).\n\n"}

This standard, which was not used elsewhere in the Hellenistic world, was smaller than the dominant Attic weight. Consequentially, Ptolemaic coins are smaller than other Hellenistic coinage. In terms of art, the coins, which were made of silver, followed the example set by contemporary Greek currencies, with dynastic figures being typically portrayed. The Ptolemaic coin making process often resulted in a central depression, similar to what can be found on Seleucid coinage.\n\nThe Ptolemaic dynasty introduced coinage to Egypt, where pre-existing native dynasties did not use coins. The first Ptolemaic mint was in Memphis and was later moved to Alexandria. Succeeding in monetizing the Egyptian society, largely due to efforts of king Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Ptolemaic kingdom flourished. For most of its history, the kingdom vigorously enforced a policy of a single currency, confiscating foreign coins found on its territory and forcing its dominions to adopt Ptolemaic coinage. In the rare cases when these dominions were allowed their own currency, such as the Jewish community in Palestine, they still had to observe the Ptolemaic weight. These policies, along with inflation and increasing difficulty to obtain silver, caused monetary isolation of the Ptolemaic coinage.\n\nAfter Egypt was annexed into the Roman Empire and the Ptolemaic dynasty ceased to exist, its currency still remained in circulation. This was the case until the rule of Emperor Nero. Silver from the coins was reused for Roman tetradrachm. Denarii and aurei did not circulate in the former Ptolemaic Kingdom, so Egypt's monetary isolation continued.\n\nPtolemaic Kingdom used Phoenician weight instead of the more common Attic weight. Phoenician weight, also known as Ptolemaic weight, is about 14,20 grams. The more common Attic weight from other Hellenistic states is approximately 17,26 grams. Ptolemaic coinage was struck in different standard, and the kingdom sought to obtain full royal control on coinage in circulation. The largest denominations of Ptolemaic bronze coinage weight up to 100 grams.\n\nArtistically, Ptolemaic coinage closely followed contemporary Greek currencies. A commonplace symbol of the Ptolemaic dynasty is an eagle standing on a thunderbolt, first adopted by Ptolemy I Soter. The more peculiar Ptolemaic coinage include so-called \"dynastic issues\". Ptolemy II Philadelphus married his sister Arsinoe II, possibly to gain legitimacy in eyes of the local Egyptian population. Egyptian rulers had traditionally married their sisters to signify a connection to sacred union between the deities Osiris and Isis. A medal-like coin with one side portraying Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, and the other side portraying Ptolemy I and Berenice I was struck after the death of Arsinoe II. She had significant posthumous influence on Egyptian religious life, and the ruling Greek dynasty was deified.\n\nIn the coin making process, there were similarities with Seleucid coinage. For instance, Ptolemaic coins often have a central depression from the coin making process.\n\nThe first Ptolemaic mint was at Memphis. It was later moved to Alexandria.\n\nTyre was the most important coastal city out of the five Ptolemaic cities with a mint in Syria. After the Seleucid Kingdom led by Antiochus III the Great conquered Coele-Syria Ptolemais in Phoenicia (Acre) was still allowed to strike coins using the Phoenician weight. The mint remained very prolific, and was among the most active ones in the Seleucid Kingdom. It is likely that the city struck silver coinage without an interruption after it changed hands, as it was a very important city in Phoenicia. However, the Seleucids discontinued a Ptolemaic mint in Jaffa.\n\nIn Greece, Ptolemaic coinage mainly originate from Peloponnese and Euboea. Corinth did not strike Ptolemaic coinage during its brief subordination to the kingdom.\n\nCyprus had many important mints, and the island struck large amounts of Ptolemaic coinage from 200 BC to 80 BC. Cyprus was also richer in silver than Egypt. In the second century BC, most of the Cypriot coinage are easily identifiable and datable because they include abbreviations for mints and dates for both gold and silver coinage. Cypriot mints from this period include Salamis (abbr. ΣA), Kition (abbr. KI) and Paphos (abbr. Π, and later as ΠA). Meanwhile, at Crete, there was no royal coinage in use, and Cretan cities had a strong autonomy of minting their own coins.\n\nThere are no evidence that Ptolemaic mints existed in Asia Minor. Furthermore, regions such as Cilicia and Lycia had no autonomous mints striking local currency. It seems that there was little circulation of Ptolemaic currency in Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia and Cilicia. Local Pamphylian silver coinage was discontinued under Ptolemaic control. It is likely that people in southern Asia Minor simply did not have a habit of using coinage in everyday economic transactions.\n\nSilver was scarcer than gold in Egypt, and the exact ratio of their value is unclear. Silver was however probably shipped in significant quantities from abroad. In addition, Ptolemaic Cyprus produced some silver for coinage struck locally.\n\nCoinage was not used in Egypt during pre-Ptolemaic native dynasties. It has been deducted from discoveries of ancient foreign coinage in Egypt that foreign currency was used as bullion rather than as money during the native dynasties. During Ptolemaic rule, Egypt transformed from a widely currency-free society to a largely monetized one by the course of the third century BC. King Ptolemy II Philadelphus had a marked influence in the process. Greek rule monetized Egyptian taxation, and this was one of the key reasons for the success of the Ptolemaic state. Before the Ptolemaic period, metals such as copper, and grain, were used as mediums of exchange. Ptolemaic rule brought, in addition to the coinage, banks and tax farming to the country. However, even centuries earlier, increasing trade with Greece seemingly had strengthened the process of monetization. Founding of the Greek trading colony of Naukratis had coincided with the strengthening trade relations.\n\nThe Ptolemaic Kingdom did not use the Attic weight, or Attic standard, which was very common in other contemporary Hellenistic states such as the Seleucid Kingdom. Instead, the Ptolemaic Kingdom used Phoenician weight, which was smaller than the Attic weight. Consequently Ptolemaic coinage was smaller than coins used by other Hellenistic states. The kingdom also briefly utilized Rhodian standard in the transition process to the Phoenician weight. A possible reason for this very brief usage of the Rhodian weight in coinage may have resulted from strong commercial ties with the island of Rhodes. However, it is important to note that the Rhodian standard was lighter than Attic but heavier than Phoenician weight. As a result, the process shows a clear downward scale in size of the coinage. Despite this coincidence, political reasons and trade partnerships are still offering better explanations than a proposed theory that value of silver was in appreciation during Ptolemy I's reign.\n\nDuring most of the Ptolemaic Kingdom's history, it was a policy that all foreign coinage within Egypt would be confiscated by the state and replaced with Ptolemaic currency. Parallels between Athens and the Ptolemaic Kingdom can be drawn as Athens attempted to introduce a sole currency in its empire. The Ptolemaic Kingdom forced its own monetary system to its foreign dominions. In rare cases, where cities under Ptolemaic dominion were allowed to keep their local currency, the cities were still forced to convert their currency to Phoenician weight. One such instance was the Jewish community in Palestine, as they were allowed to mint coins with the names of their magistrates. However, the local Jewish currency effectively disappeared by the third century. In comparison, neighboring Seleucid Kingdom's policy was less strict in imposing the royal control on mints.\nDuring the reign of Ptolemy I Soter, the founder of the kingdom, diverse local currencies were allowed to exist. They may even have been encouraged. The exact date of elimination of non-Ptolemaic coinage varies by region. As early as during Ptolemy I's reign, the closed nature of Ptolemaic monetary system started to form. In Egypt and Syria, Ptolemy I discontinued local coinage, which had Alexander the Great's image struck in them, after feeling secure in power. Such coinage with Alexander on them were very common in the successor states of the Macedonian Empire. Cypriot coinage was eliminated when the local monarchies ceased to exist. In Cyrene it took even longer to eliminate municipal coinage. In Crete the local currency was never suppressed. Uniformity of the currency was sought flexibly, yet opportunistically.\n\nAs it became increasingly difficult to obtain silver for the Ptolemaic kingdom, bronze coinage largely replaced silver in Egypt. Furthermore, monetary isolation was increased by other factors, like considerable inflation and the use of a unique standard to replace the Attic weight. Early Ptolemaic silver coinage was struck from pure silver, but by the time of Cleopatra VII it had suffered a very large degree of debasement. Despite of the economic difficulties in the Ptolemaic realm, economically notable debasement began in 136 BC. After Cleopatra VII's economic reform in 51 BC a type of stater that was only one third silver was issued.\n\nAfter the demise of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and annexation into the growing Roman Empire, silver coinage struck by the Ptolemies still continued to circulate. The Ptolemaic silver coinage mostly disappeared by the time of Emperor Nero. It is assumed that by that time, in the first half of the first century, the Ptolemaic silver coinage was probably recycled into a new currency, Roman tetradrachms, struck at mints managed by the Romans. Roman Egypt remained monetarily as a closed system, like it had been under Ptolemaic dynasty. Roman denarii and aurei did not circulate in provincial Egypt.\n\n\n\n"}

The strong west-to-east air currents are caused by the combination of air being displaced from the Equator towards the South Pole, the Earth's rotation, and the scarcity of landmasses to serve as windbreaks.\n\nThe Roaring Forties were a major aid to ships sailing the Brouwer Route from Europe to the East Indies or Australasia during the Age of Sail, and in modern usage are favoured by yachtsmen on round-the-world voyages and competitions. The boundaries of the Roaring Forties are not consistent, and shift north or south depending on the season. Similar but stronger conditions occurring in more southerly latitudes are referred to as the Furious Fifties and the Shrieking or Screaming Sixties.\n\nHot air rises at the Equator and is pushed towards the poles by cooler air travelling towards the Equator (an atmospheric circulation feature known as the Hadley Cell). At about 30 degrees from the equator, the outward-travelling air sinks to lower altitudes, and continues toward the poles closer to the ground (the Ferrel Cell), then rises up again from about 60 degrees as the air joins the Polar vortex. This travel in the 30 to 60 degree zone combines with the rotation of the earth to move the air currents from west to east, creating westerly winds. \n\nUnlike the northern hemisphere, the large tracts of open ocean south of the 40th parallel south (interrupted only by Tasmania, New Zealand, and the southern part of South America) allow higher windspeeds to develop. Similar but stronger wind conditions prevalent closer to the South Pole are referred to as the \"Furious Fifties\" (50 to 60 degrees south), and the \"Shrieking\" or \"Screaming Sixties\" (below 60 degrees south). The latitude ranges for the Roaring Forties and similar winds are not consistent, shifting towards the South Pole in the southern summer, and towards the Equator in the southern winter.\n\nDuring the Age of Sail, ships travelling from Europe to the East Indies or Australasia would sail down the west coast of Africa and round the Cape of Good Hope to use the Roaring Forties to speed their passage across the Indian Ocean, then on the return leg, continue eastwards across the Pacific Ocean and under Cape Horn before sailing up the east coast of the Americas to home. It was first used by Dutch explorer Hendrik Brouwer in his Brouwer Route, discovered in 1611, which effectively halved the duration of the trip from Europe to Java. \"To run the easting down\" was the phrase used to describe the fast passages achieved in the Roaring Forties.\n\nRound-the-world sailors also take advantage of the Roaring Forties to speed travel times, in particular those involved in record attempts or races.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "524919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524919", "title": "Ruth Montgomery", "text": "Ruth Montgomery\n\nRuth Shick Montgomery (June 11, 1912 – June 10, 2001) was a journalist with a long career as a reporter and syndicated columnist in Washington, DC. Later in life she became a self-proclaimed psychic and author of numerous books on occult and New Age subjects, whose predictions regarding the \"polar shift of 1999\" heads a long list of attempts to foretell the future. She was a biographer of alleged paranormal medium Jeane Dixon and a protégée of Arthur Ford who posited unsupported claims that he (like Edgar Cayce) could access the Akashic Records (or database) of the Universe.\n\nAfter her long-time friend and mentor, celebrity medium Arthur Ford, died, Montgomery began automatic writing, first with a pencil, later with a typewriter, and said she was able to communicate with Ford, though this claim was never tested under laboratory conditions. According to Montgomery, this postmortem communication was the basis for a lengthy series of books which resulted in her achieving minor celebrity status during the 1960s and 1970s, at which time Montgomery became a regular on the morning talk show circuit, and was for a time a household name.\n\nMontgomery, who enjoyed great financial success via her prolific New Age writings, initially claimed to believe her mission on Earth was to educate the public regarding her views on life after death, which is common among spiritualists. However, she also studied reincarnation and came to believe that mental and physical illnesses often have their origins in past lives. Montgomery wrote of such things as birth marks indicating the possible sites of past life injuries, and commented that often children born with serious defects or illnesses are in fact re-paying debts incurred in previous existences. Her books were often filled with claims about the past lives of the famous among her contemporaries, stating that Ernest Hemingway had once been a Hun warrior, and that in a previous incarnation Jacqueline Kennedy was a famed French queen.\n\nMontgomery was a believer in the existence of extraterrestrial contact, and claimed to have met non-human aliens on a number of occasions, particularly when she resided in Mexico in the 1970s, though she presented no physical evidence of these experiences. In one book she wrote of missing an opportunity to ride in a flying saucer due to her husband, Bob, enduring a minor illness at the time the offer of a ride was made by space aliens.\n\nWith other like-minded mystics, Montgomery founded the Association for Past Life Research and Therapy. Her many books (allegedly channeled via automatic writing from her spirit guides) popularized spiritualist notions in public consciousness in the 1960s through the 1990s, and paved the way for what is now known as the New Age movement. Montgomery is particularly noted for popularizing the walk-in theory whereby a person's soul can depart a hurt or anguished body and be replaced with a new soul which overtakes the body. She filled a book with an extensive list of present-day and historical individuals she said were examples of \"walk-ins\" and claimed several US Presidents were among this group.\n\nMontgomery began her long journalism profession as a cub reporter for \"Waco-News-Tribune\" while receiving her education at Baylor University (1930–1935). Later she graduated from Purdue University (1934) and began work as a reporter on the \"Louisville Herald-Post\".\n\nIn 1943, she became the first female reporter in the Washington bureau of the \"New York Daily News\", and embarked on her extensive Washington DC career. She covered notable foreign affairs (the Berlin Airlift among them), was a syndicated columnist for Hearst Headlines and United Press International and was a well-read correspondent with the International News Service.\n\nAt Franklin D. Roosevelt's funeral, Montgomery was the only female of the 12 invited reporters. In 1950, while a reporter for the \"New York Daily News\", she was voted president of the Women’s National Press Club. In 1959, she was a member of then Vice-President Richard Nixon's press corps on his tour of Russia. Montgomery wrote of her 25 years covering Washington in her 1970 book, “Hail to the Chiefs; My Life and Times with Six Presidents”.\n\nMontgomery wrote annual newspaper columns listing predictions by psychic Jeane Dixon beginning in 1952. In 1962, “Once There was a Nun: Mary McCarran's Years as Sister Mary Mercy” was published and thus began Montgomery’s long career as a non-fiction author. In 1965 her book, “A Gift of Prophecy” about Jeane Dixon was published and became a best-seller, selling over 3 million copies.\n\nMontgomery retired from her journalism career in 1969. As part of their Texas Collection, the Archives Division at Baylor University contains a research collection which include papers of Montgomery.\n\nShe held honorary doctor of law degrees from Baylor University and Ashland College.\n\nIn her book \"A World Beyond\", Montgomery revealed that in a past incarnation she had been alive during the time of Christ and known as Lazarus' third sister Ruth, who is not mentioned in the Bible. As this woman, Montgomery claims to have witnessed Jesus' circumcision.\n\nEchoing the earlier predictions of Edgar Cayce, Montgomery believed that ancient advanced civilizations of \"Mu\" and \"Atlantis\" had destroyed themselves thousands of years in the pre-history of modern man. Montgomery claimed we would see remnants of the lost continent of Atlantis rise from the sea after a \"Polar Shift\" which she foretold coming to pass in 1999.\n\nMontgomery predicted in the 1970s (with the help of her supposed spirit guides) that World War III would begin in the mid-1980s when a brush-fire conflict, started by Ethiopian strongman Mengistu Haile Mariam, would spread first to the Middle East, and then Europe. Montgomery's alleged \"guides\" stated that humans have free will and can make their own decisions regarding their destiny, and after the failure of her predictions regarding global strife, attributed her error to this cause.\n\nMontgomery also predicted that Ronald Reagan would be a one-term President to be followed in 1984 by a big-spending Democrat, and that in the 1970s and 1980s, America would have a \"walk-in\" as president in the 1990s, (\"unsure which term, 1992 or 1996\") before a Polar Shift, which was to happen \"in the last months of the century\" would eradicate most human life on Earth, and greatly alter existing coastlines.\n\nThe Guides predicted in her 1999 book \"The World To Come\" that the walk-in president would not come until 2008 at the earliest, and therefore the Shift would be delayed until 2010-2012 at least. The potential catastrophe of the shift was also reduced by human free will. Except for Florida and the coast of California, the Guides reported, most of America will survive, a direct contradiction of Montgomery's earlier forecast of significant global destruction in the coming event.\n\nMontgomery's book \"Aliens Among Us\" has been cited by Sammy Hagar as the inspiration for the 1985 Van Halen song \"Love Walks In\". The book’s account of benevolent aliens residing on earth in human form for the purpose of assisting humanity during a critical time is the template for speculation in UFOlogy communities. Alleged extraterrestrial candidates include far-reaching public figures such as technology visionary Steve Jobs, psychic medium Danielle Egnew and the Dalai Lama.\n\nMontgomery was a prolific writer on the subject of clairvoyance, reincarnation, past life regression, psychic phenomena, and clandestine extraterrestrials, most of which were sold as popular mass market paperbacks.\n\n\"Once There was a Nun: Mary McCarran's years as Sister Mary Mercy\" (Putnam, 1962)\n\n\"Mrs. LBJ\" (Avon, 1964)\n\n\"A Gift of Prophecy: The Phenomenal Jeane Dixon\" (William Morrow & Company, 1965) first appeared in a condensed version as story in Reader's Digest entitled \"The Crystal Ball\" (July 1965).\n\n\"A Search for the Truth\" (William Morrow & Company, 1967)\n\n\"Flowers at the White House\" (1967)\n\n\"Here and Hereafter\" (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1968)\n\n\"Companions Along the Way\" (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1970)\n\n\"Hail to the Chiefs: My Life and Times with Six Presidents\" (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1970)\n\n\"A World Beyond: A Startling Message from the Eminent Psychic Arthur Ford from Beyond the Grave\" (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1971)\n\n\"Born to Heal: The Astonishing Story of Mr. A and the Ancient Art of Healing with Life Energies\" (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1973)\n\n\"Companions Along the Way\" (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1974)\n\n\"The World Before\" (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1976)\n\n\"Strangers Among Us: Enlightened Beings from a World to Come\" (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1978)\n\n\"Threshold to Tomorrow\" (Putnam, 1983)\n\n\"Aliens Among Us\" (Putnam, 1985)\n\n\"Ruth Montgomery: Herald of the New Age\" (Fawcett, 1987)\n\n\"The World to Come: the Guides' Long-Awaited Predictions for the Dawning Age\" (Harmony, 1999)\n\n\n"}

In it, she argues against Karl Marx's claim that primitive accumulation is a necessary precursor for capitalism. Instead, she posits that primitive accumulation is a fundamental characteristic of capitalism itself—that capitalism, in order to perpetuate itself, requires a constant infusion of expropriated capital.\n\nFederici connects this expropriation to women's unpaid labour, both connected to reproduction and otherwise, which she frames as a historical precondition to the rise of a capitalist economy predicated upon wage labor. Related to this, she outlines the historical struggle for the commons and the struggle for communalism. Instead of seeing capitalism as a liberatory defeat of feudalism, Federici interprets the ascent of capitalism as a reactionary move to subvert the rising tide of communalism and to retain the basic social contract.\n\nShe situates the institutionalization of rape and prostitution, as well as the heretic and witch-hunt trials, burnings, and torture at the center of a methodical subjugation of women and appropriation of their labor. This is tied into colonial expropriation and provides a framework for understanding the work of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and other proxy institutions as engaging in a renewed cycle of primitive accumulation, by which everything held in common—from water, to seeds, to our genetic code—becomes privatized in what amounts to a new round of enclosures.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded when Texas was still a part of Mexico, the settlement was the site of the Convention of 1836 and the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence. The name \"Washington-on-the-Brazos\" was used to distinguish the settlement from \"Washington-on-the-Potomac\"—i.e., Washington, D.C.\n\nFounded largely by immigrants from the southern United States, Washington-on-the-Brazos is known as \"the birthplace of Texas\" because it was here that, on March 1, 1836, Texas delegates met to formally announce Texas' intention to separate from Mexico and to draft the constitution of the new Republic of Texas. They organized an interim government to serve until a government could be elected and inaugurated.\n\nThe delegates declared independence on March 2, 1836. They adopted their constitution on March 16. The delegates worked until March 17, when they had to flee with the residents of Washington, to escape the advancing Mexican Army. The townspeople returned after the Mexican Army was defeated at San Jacinto on April 21. Town leaders lobbied for Washington’s designation as the permanent capital of the Republic of Texas, but leaders of the Republic favored Waterloo, which later was renamed Austin.\n\nWashington County was established by the legislature of the Republic of Texas in 1836 and organized in 1837, when Washington-on-the-Brazos was designated as the county seat. Although the county seat moved to Brenham in 1844, the town continued to thrive as a center for the cotton trade until the mid-1850s, as it was located on the Brazos River to use for shipping out the crop. The construction of railroads bypassed the town and pulled off its business. The strife of the Civil War took another toll on the town, and by the turn of the 20th century it was virtually abandoned.\n\nThe State of Texas purchased of the old townsite in 1916 and built a replica of the building where the delegates met.
