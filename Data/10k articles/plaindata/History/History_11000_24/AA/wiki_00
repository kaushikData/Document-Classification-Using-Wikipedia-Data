The agreement was built on the basis of the previous Anglo-French agreement relating to the area, known as the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement.\n\nWhile the agreement was ostensibly focused on the French goal to take responsibility over their allotted areas of responsibility, now under Allenby’s military command, the British used the agreement to begin the revision of the Sykes-Picot allocations.\n\nIn practice, the agreement resulted in the creation of the three OETA territories: South (Palestine) with a British-led administration, West (the north Mediterranean coast including Lebanon), with a French-led administration, and East (inland Syria including Transjordan), with an Arab-led administration.\n\nThe key terms of the agreement were as follows; the map references related to the 1916 Sykes-Picot map:\n\nIn the areas of special French interest, as described in the Anglo–French Agreement of 1916, which are or may be occupied by the Allied forces of the Egyptian expeditionary force, the Commander- in-Chief will recognise the representative of the French government as his Chief Political Adviser.

Each of the three sheets contains a different version of the same image, reflecting progressive stages in the woodblock printing process.\nThe print is a portrait of a contemporary \"kabuki\" actor in the role of a samurai, and belongs to a series of images of heroes. The print belongs to the permanent collection of the Prince Takamado Gallery of Japanese Art in the Royal Ontario Museum, Canada.\n\n\nDespite his status as \"the most important and prolific mid-nineteenth century Osaka designer,\" little is known of Hirosada's personal details. The few biographies listing his life dates identify his birth year as unknown and that of his death as 1864 or 1865. Art historians link his activity to between 1810 and 1865. He has been acknowledged as \"the central figure of mid-nineteenth century Osaka printmaking.\" He was very prolific, producing predominantly \"kabuki-e\" and \"yakusha-e\" \"chūban\" prints. He is particularly known for his \"ōkubi-e\" (lit. \"large head\") portraits of leading Osaka actors such as this print.\n\nHirosada used a number of \"gō\" art names throughout his career, including , and . He apparently began his career as , switching to Hirosada in mid-1847. Some have suggested that Hirosada and his contemporary (fl. 1830-1847) were the same person; however, this remains unproven.\n\nAs with Hirosada, little is known about the personal life of . He was born the son of a carpenter, but became the student then adopted son of kabuki actor . He was known by various names during his career including the following:\nThe last known mention of his name in print is in 1851, so it is presumed that he died in this year or soon after.\n\nThis print and the several others in the series from which it is taken depict characters from a staging of the play performed in Osaka in the third month of 1848. The play was originally written for the \"bunraku\" puppet theatre by Takeda Izumo II, Miyoshi Shōraku and Namiki Senryū I in 1748, and adapted for kabuki later that year. It remains one of the most famous and popular plays in the kabuki repertoire.\n\nA \"jidaimono\" historical drama, the play tells the ostensibly true and pervasively enduring story of a 1702 incident known as the Akō Affair, in which 47 loyal retainers of a wronged lord avenged his death then committed ritual \"seppuku\" suicide. The story of the 47 \"ronin\" has long been repeated and romanticized as an idealization of the \"bushido\" ethos, and held particular appeal during the latter half of the Tokugawa era despite, or perhaps in part due to, strict censorship imposed on re-tellings of the incident by the shogunate.\n\nThe print belongs to a series of six known prints translated as \"Tales of Retainers of Unswerving Loyalty\" or \"The Exemplary Loyalty of the Faithful Samurai\". Like the characters from the play depicted in each image from the series, Katō Yomoshichi is one of the loyal retainers of the provincial lord Enya Hangan. The others are as follows:\n\nHirosada produced multiple albums of this type portraying popular actors of the day as heroic warriors, including 忠孝武勇伝 (\"Chūka buyūden\") (\"Tales of Loyalty and Filial Devotion\") and 高名武勇伝 (\"Kōmei buyūden\") (\"Tales of Brave Warriors of Renown\" or \"Tales of Renowned Heroes\"), both issued in 1848. Doesburg has argued that such collections are attempts to circumvent censorship of kabuki-themed \"ukiyo-e\" under the Tenpō Reforms by cloaking the dramatic content within titles suggesting the promotion of moral values and \"suggesting that the portraits were actually representations of famous men and women from history and legend\".\n\nGosōtei Hirosada's works are categorized as , a term used to distinguish prints produced in the Kamigata area (Kyoto and Osaka) from those produced in Edo. Gaining prominence about a century after the emergence of \"ukiyo-e\" in Edo, \"kamigata-e\" were predominantly (images of \"kabuki\" actors), and were produced almost exclusively by amateur “talented kabuki fans” promoting their favourite actors.\n\nLiterally 'kabuki pictures', \"kabuki-e\" began to be produced in Edo in the late seventeenth century. As kabuki grew in popularity, stars emerged, which in turn led to the (actor print) subgenre. Further subgenres of \"yakusha-e\" include bust portraits, full-length portraits, parody pictures, and death portraits.\n\n\"Ōkubi-e\" prints, also known as , are close-up ukiyo-e head shots of actors or beautiful women. Hirosada's print bears many of the typical marks of this genre including the plain background, the dramatic posing of the hands and arms, and the emphasis on facial features and make-up. Hirosada is particularly associated with this genre of print due to both the number and quality of works of this type that he produced.\n\n \n\n"}
{"id": "140683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140683", "title": "Agathias", "text": "Agathias\n\nAgathias or Agathias Scholasticus (; 582/594), of Myrina (Mysia), an Aeolian city in western Asia Minor (now in Turkey), was a Greek poet and the principal historian of part of the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian I between 552 and 558.\n\nAgathias was a native of Myrina (Mysia). His father was Memnonius. His mother was presumably Pericleia. A brother of Agathias is mentioned in primary sources, but his name has not survived. Their probable sister Eugenia is known by name. The \"Suda\" clarifies that Agathias was active in the reign of the Roman emperor Justinian I, mentioning him as a contemporary of Paul the Silentiary, Macedonius of Thessalonica and Tribonian.\n\nAgathias mentions being present in Alexandria as a law student at the time when an earthquake destroyed Berytus (Beirut). The law school of Berytus had been recognized as one of the three official law schools of the empire (533). Within a few years, as the result of the disastrous earthquake of 551, the students were transferred to Sidon. The dating of the event to 551: as a law student, Agathias could be in his early twenties, which would place his birth to .\n\nHe mentions leaving Alexandria for Constantinople shortly following the earthquake. Agathias visited the island of Kos, where \"he witnessed the devastation caused by the earthquake\". At the fourth year of his legal studies, Agathias and fellow students Aemilianus, John and Rufinus are mentioned making a joint offering to Michael the Archangel at Sosthenium, where they prayed for a \"prosperous future\".\n\nHe returned to Constantinople in 554 to finish his training, and practised as an advocatus (\"scholasticus\") in the courts. John of Epiphania reports that Agathias practiced his profession in the capital. Evagrius Scholasticus and Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos describe Agathias as a rhetor (\"public speaker\"). The \"Suda\" and a passage of John of Nikiû call him \"Agathias the scholastic\". He is known to have served as pater civitatis (\"Father of the City\", effectively a magistrate) of Smyrna. He is credited with constructing public latrines for the city. While Agathias mentions these buildings, he fails to mention his own role in constructing them.\n\nMyrina is known to have erected statues to honor Agathias, his father Memnonius, and Agathias' unnamed brother. He seems to have been known to his contemporaries more as an advocatus and a poet. There are few mentions of Agathias as a historian.\n\nFew details survive of his personal life – mainly in his extant poems. One of them tells the story of his pet cat eating his partridge. Another (Gr.Anth. 7.220) responds to his seeing the tomb of the courtesan Lais of Corinth, implying a visit to that city, which he refers to using the poetic name Ephyra. No full account of his life survives.\n\nLiterature, however, was Agathias' favorite pursuit, and he remains best known as a poet. Of his \"Daphniaca\", a collection of short poems in hexameter on 'love and romance' in nine books, only the introduction has survived. But he also composed over a hundred epigrams, which he published together with epigrams by friends and contemporaries in a \"Cycle of New Epigrams\" or \"Cycle of Agathias\", probably early in the reign of emperor Justin II (r. 565–578). This work largely survives in the \"Greek Anthology\"—the edition by Maximus Planudes preserves examples not found elsewhere. Agathias's poems exhibit considerable taste and elegance.\n\nHe also wrote marginal notes on the \"Description of Greece\" () of Pausanias.\n\nAlmost equally valued are Agathias's \"Histories\", which he started in the reign of Justin II. He explains his own motivation in writing it, as simply being unwilling to let \"the momentous events of his own times\" go unrecorded. He credits his friends with encouraging him to start this endeavor, particularly one Eutychianus. This work in five books, \"On the Reign of Justinian\", continues the history of Procopius, whose style it imitates, and is the chief authority for the period 552–558. It deals chiefly with the struggles of the Imperial army, under the command of general Narses, against the Goths, Vandals, Franks and Persians.\n\nThe work survives, but seems incomplete. Passages of his history indicate that Agathias had planned to cover both the final years of Justin II and the fall of the Huns but the work in its known form includes neither. Menander Protector implies that Agathias died before having a chance to complete his history. The latest event mentioned in the Histories is the death of the Persian king Khosrau I (r. 531–579); which indicates that Agathias was still alive in the reign of Tiberius II Constantine (r. 578–582). The emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) is never mentioned, suggesting that Agathias was dead by 582.\n\nMenander Protector continued the history of Agathias, covering the period from 558 to 582. Evagrius Scholasticus alludes to Agathias' work, but he doesn't seem to have had access to the full History.\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition, \"The author prides himself on his honesty and impartiality, but he is lacking in judgment and knowledge of facts; the work, however, is valuable from the importance of the events of which it treats\". Britannica also noted that Edward Gibbon contrasted Agathias as \"a poet and rhetorician\" with Procopius, \"a statesman and soldier.\"\n\nChristian commentators note the superficiality of Agathias' nominal Christianity: \"There are reasons for doubting that he was a Christian, though it seems improbable that he could have been at that late date a genuine pagan\" (\"Catholic Encyclopedia\"). \"No overt pagan could expect a public career during the reign of Justinian, yet the depth and breadth of Agathias' culture was not Christian\" (Kaldellis).\n\nAgathias (\"Histories\" 2.31) is the only authority for the story of Justinian's closing of the re-founded Platonic (actually neoplatonic) Academy in Athens (529), which is sometimes cited as the closing date of \"Antiquity\". The dispersed neo-Platonists, with as much of their library as could be transported, found temporary refuge in the Persian capital of Ctesiphon, and afterwards— under treaty guarantees of security that form a document in the history of freedom of thought— at Edessa, which just a century later became one of the places where Muslim thinkers encountered ancient Greek culture and took an interest in its science and medicine.\n\nAgathias's \"Histories\" are also a source of information about pre-Islamic Iran, providing—in summary form—\"our earliest substantial evidence for the Khvadhaynamagh tradition\", that later formed the basis of Ferdowsi's \"Shahname\" and provided much of the Iranian material for al-Tabari's \"History\".\nAgathias recorded the earliest description of the rules of backgammon, which he calls \"τάβλη (tabula)\" as it is still called in Greece, in a story relating an unlucky game played by the emperor Zeno. Zeno had a stack of seven checkers, three stacks of two checkers and two \"blots\", checkers that stand alone on a point and are therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opponent checker. Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6. The white and black checkers were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots, thus exposing them to capture and ruining the game for Zeno.\n\n\n\n"}

This article will summarize historical trends. \n\nAristotle established a difference between economics and chrematistics that would be foundational in medieval thought. For Aristotle, the accumulation of money itself is an unnatural activity that dehumanizes those who practice it. Trade Exchanges, money for goods, and usury creates money from money, but do not produce useful goods. Hence, Aristotle, like Plato, condemns these actions from the standpoint of their philosophical ethics.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, the \"necessary\" chrematistic economy is licit if the sale of goods is made directly between the producer and buyer at the right price; it does not generate a value-added product. By contrast, it is illicit if the producer purchases for resale to consumers for a higher price, generating added value. The money must be only a medium of exchange and measure of value.\n\nThe Catholic Church maintained this economic doctrine throughout the Middle Ages. Saint Thomas Aquinas accepted capital accumulation if it served for virtuous purposes as charity.\n\nAlthough Martin Luther raged against usury and extortion, modern sociologists have argued that he inspired doctrines that assisted in the spread of capitalistic practices in early modern Europe. Max Weber argued that Protestant sects emphasized frugality, sobriety, deferred consumption, and saving.\n\nIn Karl Marx's \"Das Kapital\", Marx developed a labor theory of value inspired by Aristotle's notions of exchange and highlighting the consequences of what he also calls \"Auri Sacra Fames\" (damned thirst for gold), a Latin reference of Virgil to the passion of money for money itself.\n\n"}

{"id": "55895027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55895027", "title": "Disposable soma theory of aging", "text": "Disposable soma theory of aging\n\nThe disposable soma theory of aging states that organisms age due to an evolutionary trade-off between growth, reproduction, and DNA repair maintenance. Formulated by Thomas Kirkwood, the disposable soma theory explains that an organism only has a limited amount of resources or \"soma\" that it can allocate to its various cellular processes. Therefore, a greater investment in growth and reproduction would result in reduced investment in DNA repair maintenance, leading to increased cellular damage, shortened telomeres, accumulation of mutations, compromised stem cells, and ultimately, senescence. Although many models, both animal and human, have appeared to support this theory, parts of it are still controversial. \nSpecifically, while the evolutionary trade-off between growth and aging has been well established, \nthe relationship between reproduction and aging is still without scientific consensus, and the cellular mechanisms largely undiscovered.\n\nBritish biologist Thomas Kirkwood first proposed the disposable soma theory of aging in a 1977 \"Nature\" review article. The theory was inspired by Leslie Orgel's Error Catastrophe Theory of Aging, which was published fourteen years earlier, in 1963. Orgel believed that the process of aging arose due to mutations acquired during the replication process, and Kirkwood developed the disposable soma theory in order to mediate Orgel's work with evolutionary genetics.\n\nThe disposable soma theory of aging acts on the premise that there is a tradeoff in resource allocation between somatic maintenance and reproductive investment. Too low an investment in self-repair would be evolutionarily unsound, as the organism would likely die before reproductive age. However, too high an investment in self-repair would also be evolutionarily unsound due to the fact that one's offspring would likely die before reproductive age. Therefore, there is a compromise and resources are partitioned accordingly. However, this compromise is thought to damage somatic repair systems, which can lead to progressive cellular damage and senescence. Repair costs can be categorized into three groups: (1) the costs of increased durability of nonrenewable parts; (2) the costs of maintenance involving cell renewal, and (3) the costs of intracellular maintenance. In a nutshell, aging and decline is essentially a tradeoff for increased reproductive robustness in youth.\n\nMuch research has been done on the antagonistic effects of increased growth on lifespan. Specifically, the hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), binds to a cell receptor, leading to a phosphorylation cascade. This cascade results in kinases phosphorylating forkhead transcription factor (FOXO), deactivating it. Deactivation of FOXO results in an inability to express genes involved in responding to oxidative stress response, such as antioxidants, chaperones, and heat-shock proteins. \nAdditionally, uptake of IGF-1 stimulates the mTOR pathway, which activates protein synthesis (and therefore growth) through upregulation of the translation-promoting S6K1, and also inhibits autophagy, a process necessary for recycling of damaged cellular products. Decline of autophagy causes neurodegeneration, protein aggregation and premature aging. Lastly, studies have also indicated that the mTOR pathway also alters immune responses and stimulates cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors such as p16 and p21. This leads to alteration of the stem-cell niche and results in stem cell exhaustion, another theorized mechanism of aging.\n\nThe mechanism of why reproduction inhibits lifespan with regards to multicellular organisms is still unclear. Although many models do illustrate an inverse relationship, and the theory makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, the cellular mechanisms have yet to be explored. However, with regards to cellular replication, the progressive shortening of telomeres is a mechanism which limits the amount of generations of a single cell may undergo. Furthermore, in unicellular organisms like \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", the formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) in mother cells (but not daughter cells) upon every subsequent division is an identifiable type of DNA damage that is associated with replication. These ERCs accumulate over time and eventually trigger replicative senescence and death of the mother cell.\n\nThere is a large body of evidence indicating the negative effects of growth on longevity across many species. As a general rule, individuals of a smaller size generally live longer than larger individuals of the same species.\n\nIn dwarf models of mice, such Snell or Ames mice, mutations have arisen, either rendering them incapable of producing IGF-1 or unable to have adequate receptors for IGF-1 uptake. Furthermore, mice injected with growth hormone have been shown to have progressive weight loss, roughing of the coat, curvature of the spine, enlargement of the organs, kidney lesions and increased cancer risk. This effect is also seen in different breeds of dogs, where smaller breeds of dogs typically live significantly longer compared to their larger counterparts. Selectively bred for their small size, smaller dog breeds like the Chihuahua (average lifespan of 15–20 years) have the B/B genotype for the IGF-1 haplotype, reducing the amount of IGF-1 produced. Conversely, large dogs like the Great Dane (average lifespan of 6–8 years) are homozygous for the IGF-1 I allele, which increases the amount of IGF-1 production.\n\nInitially, it was believed that growth hormone actually prolonged lifespan due to a 1990 study that indicated that injection of growth hormone to men over 60 years of age appeared to reverse various biomarkers implicated in aging, such as decreased muscle mass, bone density, skin thickness, and increased adipose tissue. However, a 1999 study found that administering growth hormone also significantly increased mortality rate. Recent genomic studies have confirmed that the genes involved in growth hormone uptake and signaling are largely conserved across a plethora of species, such as yeast, nematodes, fruit flies, mice and humans. These studies have also shown that individuals with Laron syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in dwarfism due to defects in growth hormone receptors, have increased lifespan. Additionally, these individuals have much lower incidences of age-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer. Lastly, human centenarians around the world are disproportionately of short stature, and have low levels of IGF-1.\n\nNumerous studies have found that lifespan is inversely correlated with both the total amount of offspring birthed, as well as the age at which females first gives birth, also known as primiparity. Additionally, it has been found that reproduction is a costly mechanism that alters the metabolism of fat. Lipids invested in reproduction would be unable to be allocated to support mechanisms involved in somatic maintenance.\n\nThe disposable soma theory has been consistent with the majority of animal models. It was found in numerous animal studies that castration or genetic deformities of reproduction organs was correlated with increased lifespan. Moreover, in red squirrels, it was found that females with an early primiparity achieved the highest immediate and lifetime reproductive success. However, it was also found that these same individuals had a decreased median and maximum lifespan. Specifically squirrels who mated earlier had a 22.4% rate of mortality until two years of age compared to a 16.5% rate of mortality in late breeders. In addition, these squirrels had an average maximum lifespan of 1035 days compared to an average maximum lifespan of 1245 days for squirrels that bred later.\n\nIn another study, researchers selectively bred fruit flies over three years to develop two different strains, an early-reproducing strain and a late-reproducing strain. The late-reproducing line had a significantly longer lifespan than the early-reproducing line. Even more telling was that when the researchers introduced a mutation in the ovarian-associated gene \"ovoD1\", resulting in defective oogenesis, the differences in lifespan between the two lines disappeared. The researchers in this case concluded that \"aging has evolved primarily because of the damaging effects of reproduction earlier in life\".\n\nProminent aging researcher Steven Austad also performed a large-scale ecological study on the coast of Georgia in 1993. Austad isolated two opossum populations, one from the predator-infested mainland and one from the predator-absent nearby island of Sapelo. According to the disposable soma theory, a genetically isolated population subject to low environmentally-induced mortality would evolve delayed reproduction and aging. This is because without the pressure of predation, it would be evolutionarily advantageous to allocate more resources to somatic maintenance than reproduction, as early offspring mortality would be low. As predicted, even after controlling for predation, the isolated population had a longer lifespan, delayed primiparity, and reduced aging biomarkers such as tail collagen cross-linking.\n\nIn general, only a few studies exist in human models. It was found that castrated men live longer than their fertile counterparts. Further studies found that in British women, primiparity was earliest in women who died early and latest in women who died at the oldest ages. Furthermore, increased number of children birthed was associated with a decreased lifespan. A final study found that female centenarians were more likely to have children in later life compared average, especially past the age of 40. The researchers discovered that 19.2% of female centenarians had their first child after the age of 40, compared to 5.5% of the rest of the female population.\n\nThere are numerous studies that support cellular damage, often due to a lack of somatic maintenance mechanisms, as a primary determinant for aging, and these studies have given rise to the free radical theory of aging and the DNA damage theory of aging. One study found that the cells of short-living rodents \"in vitro\" show much greater mutation rates and a general lack of genome surveillance compared to human cells and are far more susceptible to oxidative stress. \nOther studies have been conducted on the naked mole rat, a rodent species with remarkable longevity (30 years), capable of outliving the brown rat (3 years) by ten-fold. Additionally, almost no incidence cancer has ever been detected in naked mole rats. Nearly all of the differences found between these two organisms, which are otherwise rather genetically similar, was in somatic maintenance. Naked mole rats were found to have higher levels of superoxide dismutase, a reactive oxygen species clearing antioxidant. In addition, naked mole rats had higher levels of base excision repair, DNA damage response signaling, homologous recombination repair, mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and non-homologous end joining. In fact, many of these processes were near or exceeded human levels. Proteins from naked mole rats were also more resistant to oxidation, misfolding, ubiquitination, and had increased translational fidelity.\n\nFurther studies have been conducted on patients with Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a condition that leads to premature aging. Patients with HGPS typically age about seven times faster than average and usually succumb to the disease in their early teens. Patients with HGPS have cellular defects, specifically in the lamin proteins, which regulate the organization of the lamina and nuclear envelope for mitosis. \nLastly, as mentioned previously, it has been found that the suppression of autophagy is associated with reduced lifespan, while stimulation is associated with extended lifespan. Activated in times of caloric restriction, autophagy is a process that prevents cellular damage through clearance and recycling of damaged proteins and organelles.\n\nOne of the main weaknesses of the disposable soma theory is that it does not postulate any specific cellular mechanisms to which an organism shifts energy to somatic repair over reproduction. Instead, it only offers an evolutionary perspective on why aging may occur due to reproduction. Therefore, parts of it are rather limited outside of the field of evolutionary biology.\n\nCritics have pointed out the supposed inconsistencies of the disposable soma theory due to the observed effects of caloric restriction, which is correlated with increased lifespan. Although it activates autophagy, according to classical disposable soma principles, with less caloric intake, there would less total energy to be distributed towards somatic maintenance, and decreased lifespan would be observed (or at least the positive autophagic effects would be balanced out). However, Kirkwood, alongside his collaborator Darryl P. Shanley, assert that caloric restriction triggers an adaptive mechanism which causes the organism to shift a higher proportion of resources to somatic maintenance, away from reproduction. This theory is supported by multiple studies, which show that caloric restriction typically results in impaired fertility, but leave an otherwise healthy organism. Evolutionarily, an organism would want to delay reproduction to when resources were more plentiful. During a resource-barren period, it would evolutionarily unwise to invest resources in progeny that would be unlikely to survive in famine. Mechanistically, the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) is upregulated during low-nutrient periods. SIRT-1 increases insulin sensitivity, decreases the amount of inflammatory cytokines, stimulates autophagy, and activates FOXO, the aforementioned protein involved in activating stress response genes. SIRT-1 is also found to result in decreased fertility.\n\nIn additional to differential partitioning of energy allocation during caloric restriction, less caloric intake would result in less metabolic waste in the forms of free radicals like hydrogen peroxide, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, which damage important cellular components, particularly mitochondria. Elevated levels of free radicals in mice has been correlated with neurodegeneration, myocardial injury, severe anemia, and premature death.\n\nAnother primary criticism of the disposable soma theory is that it fails to account for why women tend to live longer than their male counterparts. Afterall, females invest significantly more resources into reproduction and according to the classical disposable soma principles, this would compromise energy diverted to somatic maintenance. However, this can be reconciled with the grandmother hypothesis. The Grandmother Hypothesis states that menopause comes about into older women in order to restrict the time of reproduction as a protective mechanism. This would allow women to live longer and increase the amount of care they could provide to their grandchildren, increasing their evolutionary fitness. And so, although women do invest a greater proportion of resources into reproduction during their fertile years, their overall reproductive period is significantly shorter than men, who are able of reproduction during and even beyond middle age. Additionally, males invest more resources into growth, and have significantly higher levels of IGF-1 compared to females, which is correlated with decreased lifespan. Other variables such as increased testosterone levels in males are not accounted for. Increased testosterone is often associated with reckless behaviour, which may lead to a high accidental death rate.\n\nA few contradicting animal models weaken the validity of the disposable soma theory. This includes studies done on the aforementioned naked mole rats. In these studies, it was found that reproductive naked mole rats actually show significantly increased lifespans compared to non-reproductive individuals, which contradicts the principles of diposable soma. However, although these naked mole rats are mammalian, they are highly atypical in terms of aging studies and may not serve as the best model for humans. For example, naked mole rats have a disproportionately high longevity quotient and live in eusocial societies, where breeding is usually designated to a queen.\n\nThe disposable soma theory is tested disproportionately on female organisms for the relationship between reproduction and aging, as females carry a greater burden in reproduction. Additionally, for the relationship between growth and aging, studies are disproportionately conducted on males, to minimize the hormonal fluctuations that occur with menstrual cycling. Lastly, genetic and environmental factors, rather than reproductive patterns, may explain the variations in human lifespan. For example, studies have shown that poorer individuals, to whom nutritious food and medical care is less accessible, typically have higher birth rates and earlier primiparity.\n\n\n"}

He became the curator of the archaeological museum in Split, and was entrusted with the conservation of cultural and historical antiquities over all of Dalmatia. \n\nHe was also active politically. He was elected the representative of the county of Split in the Dalmatian parliament and as representative of Dalmatia in the Imperial Council in Vienna. He withdrew from politics during the time of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, after the Sixth of January dictatorship proclaimed by Aleksandar Karađorđević in 1929.\n\nHis archeological discoveries provided great contributions to the understanding of early Christian and Croatian history in Dalmatia. Bulić led archaeological expeditions in many locations, but especially in Solin. He discovered a basilica within the local monastery which contained the buried martyrs Dujam and Venancije from the time of the Roman Emperor Diocletian. \n\nIn 1891, he discovered a piece of stone which contained an inscription of the early Croatian ruler, knez Trpimir. In 1898 he found the sarcophagus of queen Jelena dating back to 976.

The hipster adopted the lifestyle of the jazz musician, including some or all of the following: dress, slang, use of cannabis and other drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humor, self-imposed poverty, and relaxed sexual codes.\n\nThe words \"hep\" and \"hip\" are of uncertain origin, with numerous competing theories being proposed. In the early days of jazz, musicians were using the \"hep\" variant to describe anybody who was \"in the know\" about an emerging culture, mostly black, which revolved around jazz. They and their fans were known as \"hepcats\". By the late 1930s, with the rise of swing, \"hip\" rose in popularity among jazz musicians, to replace \"hep\". Clarinetist Artie Shaw described singer Bing Crosby as \"the first hip white person born in the United States.\"\n\nIn 1939, the word \"hepster\" was used by Cab Calloway in the title of his \"Hepster's Dictionary\", which defines \"hep cat\" as \"a guy who knows all the answers, understands jive\". In 1944, pianist Harry Gibson modified this to \"hipster\" in his short glossary \"For Characters Who Don't Dig Jive Talk\", published in 1944 with the album \"Boogie Woogie In Blue\", featuring the self-titled hit \"Handsome Harry the Hipster\". The entry for \"hipsters\" defined them as \"characters who like hot jazz.\"\n\nHipsters were more interested in bebop and \"hot\" jazz than they were in swing, which by the late 1940s was becoming old-fashioned and watered down by \"squares\" like Lawrence Welk, Guy Lombardo and Robert Coates. In the 1940s, white youth began to frequent African-American communities for their music and dance. These first youths diverged from the mainstream due to their new philosophies of racial diversity and their exploratory sexual nature and drug habits. The drug of choice was marijuana, many hipster slang terms were dedicated to the substance.\n\nIn his book \"Jazz: A History\" (1977), Frank Tirro defines the 1940s hipster:\n\nTo the hipster, Bird was a living justification of their philosophy. The hipster is an underground man. He is to the Second World War what the dadaist was to the first. He is amoral, anarchistic, gentle, and overcivilized to the point of decadence. He is always ten steps ahead of the game because of his awareness, an example of which might be meeting a girl and rejecting her, because he knows they will date, hold hands, kiss, neck, pet, fornicate, perhaps marry, divorce—so why start the whole thing? He knows the hypocrisy of bureaucracy, the hatred implicit in religions—so what values are left for him?—except to go through life avoiding pain, keep his emotions in check, and after that, \"be cool,\" and look for kicks. He is looking for something that transcends all this bullshit and finds it in jazz.\n\nMarty Jezer, in \"The Dark Ages: Life in the United States 1945–1960\" (1999), provides another definition:\n\nThe new philosophy of racial role reversal was transcribed by many popular hipster authors of the time. Norman Mailer's 1957 pamphlet, entitled \"The White Negro\", has become the paradigmatic example of hipster ideology. Mailer describes hipsters as individuals \"with a middle-class background (who) attempt to put down their whiteness and adopt what they believe is the carefree, spontaneous, cool lifestyle of Negro hipsters: their manner of speaking and language, their use of milder narcotics, their appreciation of jazz and the blues, and their supposed concern with the good orgasm.\" In a nod to Mailer's discussion of hipsterism, the United States' Cold War deployments of African American culture and personalities for the purposes of public diplomacy has been discussed as \"hipster diplomacy\".\n\n"}

The HSAPB set out to restore and reconstruct Spanish colonial era buildings in a focused area of downtown St. Augustine in anticipation of the city's Quadricentennial Celebration in 1965, and maintained a research library of documentary evidence to support their preservation and interpretation efforts. The HSAPB was sundowned by the \"State of Florida\" in June 1997.\n\nIn March 1958, a group from St. Augustine made a presentation to Governor LeRoy Collins to propose a historic preservation program for the city’s historic downtown. House Bill 774 was signed into law on June 11, 1959, establishing the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission. This bill also granted $150,000 of state funds to begin their work. The primary objective of their program was to recreate Spanish colonial architecture and culture of St. Augustine during the period of 1565 to 1821 in advance of the city’s Quadricentennial Celebration in 1965. The buildings restored and reconstructed represent structures of the First Spanish Period (to 1763), British Period (1763-83), Second Spanish Period (1783-1821, and the early American Period (after 1821).\n\nOriginal members of the Commission included H.E. Wolfe, Leonard Usina, William F. Rolleston, William L. Sims, II, and Henrietta Poynter. Wolfe, a resident of St. Augustine, was the Commission’s first chairman. The Commission hired consultant Earle Newton to help them develop a strategic plan for restoration and preservation, and soon began historical and archaeological research for the properties they proposed to restore.\n\nThe Commission’s first restoration project was the Arrivas House on St. George Street. Then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson visited St. Augustine on March 11, 1963 to dedicate the house. The Commission used the second floor of the Arrivas House as their administrative offices until 1970, when they moved operations to Government House.\n\nThe Commission opened a living history museum village in its restored area in 1963, calling it San Agustín Antiguo. Costumed interpreters gave tours of restored buildings and demonstrated a variety of arts and crafts typical of the First and Second Spanish Periods, as well as of the British Period. These included blacksmithing, weaving, printing, candle dipping, silversmithing, pottery, baking, and leather making. Today a portion of the original museum village still demonstrates early Spanish life in St. Augustine at the Colonial Quarter.\n\nOn May 5, 1970, the St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission was renamed the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board, enacted by Florida Statute Section 266.01-07. The Board continued to fulfill their mission until 1997.\n\nThe Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board was abolished by the State of Florida in June 1997 in accordance with the Sundown Act At this time the City of St. Augustine took over management of the historic properties. Today, the legacy of the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board lives on through UF Historic St. Augustine, Inc. (UFHSA), a direct support organization of the University of Florida. Many of the properties restored or reconstructed by the Board are owned by the State of Florida and managed by UFHSA on its behalf.

He is noted mostly as a historian; his works focus on Navarre and the Carlist wars. As a public servant he is known as longtime head of Navarrese library network, regional Ministry of Information delegate and a governmental and self-governmental tourist official. As a Carlist he is acknowledged as moving spirit behind the Navarrese Requeté in the 1930s and as representative of the Carloctavista faction during early Francoism. He also wrote novels, poems and dramas.\n\nThere is next to nothing known about del Burgo’s paternal ancestors. Though some authors claim that already his grandfather contributed to the Carlist cause, no other account confirms this or clarifies his identity; the official del Burgo’s birth certificate refers to his paternal grandparents as \"abuelos incognitos\". None of the sources consulted offers much information on his father Eusebio (1887-1970). Even his exact surname remains unclear; some sources claim he was named Eusebio del Burgo Pascual while an official document certifies he was born Eusebio Percal and it only changed to Eusebio del Burgo Pascual in 1926. According to one author he originated from the Navarrese town of Villava, according to another he was born in Pamplona. Nothing is known about his profession; politically he sympathised with the Carlists and at the age of 45 took part in street brawls. He married a pamplonesa, Paula Torres Jacoiste (1887-1973). Living in Pamplona, the couple had three sons and four daughters, all brought up in Traditionalist ambience and fervently Catholic atmosphere, at times bordering exaltation. \n\nJaime Victoriano Martin was born as Percal y Torres and it is not clear in what circumstances the family changed their surname to del Burgo. Nothing is known about his early childhood; as a teenager he trained to become \"\" at unidentified school, possibly in Villava. He has never pursued a professional commercial career; during his adolescence years he was increasingly engaged in public activities, consuming more and more of his time. Del Burgo married Maria de las Mercedes Tajadura Goñi (1911-1999); her father, Federico Tajadura Arnaíz, was a military official. The couple had three children, Mercedes, Jaime Ignacio and Maria Antonia. Upon his death he left three children, thirteen grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. His son Jaime Ignacio del Burgo Tajadura was a conservative politician and the Prime Minister of Navarre (president of ) in 1979-1984. His grandson Ignacio del Burgo Azpíroz, otherwise a Pamplona lawyer, gained wider recognition as author of a historical novel. Another of his grandchildren, an entrepreneur Jaime del Burgo Azpíroz, married an older sister of Letizia Ortiz, becoming brother-in-law of Felipe VI of Spain.\n\nAlready as a youngster del Burgo engaged in the Carlist juvenile organization, Juventud Jaimista, in 1930 becoming secretary of the Navarrese branch of the organization; a year later he set up a local Carlist weekly \"La Esperanza\", trying his hand as an editor, manager and contributor. In 1931 he was among those founding provincial branch of the newly born national Carlist student association, Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista. Remaining at its helm until the outbreak of the Civil War, del Burgo exercised enormous influence on the group and beyond, especially as in 1934 it launched its press tribune, the \"a.e.t.\" weekly.\n\nInitially Navarrese AET focused on juvenile activities like sport, leisure and outdoor, though they were increasingly flavored by cult of brotherhood, Carlist heroes, activism and virility, combined with anti-materialist spiritualism and a drive for change. A present scholar relates them to Sorel, Marinetti, T.S. Eliot and W. B. Yeats, also drawing parallels between aetistas and a millenarist Romanian ultra-Right Legion of Archangel Michael; another one points to fascist influence Indeed, the Sorelian thread manifested itself by social radicalism of Del Burgo and \"a.e.t.\" The group departed from orthodox Traditionalist line, commiserating with masses of miserable beings pitted against the politically dominant potentates; they advocated limitation of wealth and regularization of profits. Contemptuous towards Carlist landowners like José Lamamié and Jaime Chicharro, the students supported Agrarian Reform, obstructed by feudal egoism of the odious grandees of grain. The group called for a Carlist Revolution aiming at a good clean-up of society, and was greeted with amazement by the older Carlist generation.\n\nThe rupturista stance of the aetistas had nothing in common with social radicalism of the republican Left. It remained extremely hostile towards the mass workers’ parties, their militancy to be confronted with vengeance and repaid with \"bomb, dagger and fire\", the cult of activism bordering the cult of violence. Strategy of Carlist leaders was denounced as ineffective; in 1934 del Burgo and the young, having declared themselves rebels fed up with legality, accused the old junteros of 3 years of inactivity, their only achievement having been the alliance with caciques and debris of the fallen liberal monarchy. AET despised parliamentary activities of the party elders and especially accommodation with the Alfonsists. The intemperate tone of the aetistas shocked the Navarrese Carlist authorities and made them call for moderation. As a result, Del Burgo did not regret Tomás Domínguez Arévalo resignation and welcomed the appointment of Manuel Fal Conde.\n\nIn 1931 del Burgo engaged in the Carlist militia Requeté, at that time undergoing rapid expansion and partial restructuring. He demonstrated enormous dedication and great organizational capacity, along Generoso Huarte becoming one of key field commanders and focusing on the province of Pamplona. Participating in street brawls against socialist groups, he was arrested following the clashes of April 1932. Charged with trafficking arms – which he did indeed – del Burgo was acquitted due to lack of evidence, though in total he remained behind bars for 6 months. Released, he again became one of the most active Requeté operatives in Navarre, especially under the new, strictly military organization engineered by Varela.\n\nEarly 1934 del Burgo led one of the two already formed Pamplona piquetes. During the spring he and 14 other Carlists travelled to Italy under the false Peruvian identities; at the air base they underwent specialist military training, focusing on usage of machine guns and grenades, infantry tactics and urban warfare. Back in Spain, del Burgo wrote tactical rulebook with instructions as to group alignment and positioning, fire drills, march and engagement distances etc., all calibrated for small groups and mostly urban combat. Promoted to lieutenant, he broadened his training to the Carlist NCOs. Early 1936 Pamplona could already present one battalion; del Burgo was leading one of its 3 companies.\n\nShortly before and during the first day of the coup del Burgo was instrumental to organizing the Pamplona Requeté units. The Pamplona tercio was fragmented, del Burgo’s company incorporated into a mixed 7th Batallón del Regimiento de América. He left Pamplona on July 19; following few days in Rioja, the battalion was moved to Navafria area in Sierra de Guadarrama, in August engaged in heavy fighting for the Somosierra pass. In September he was withdrawn to a hospital in the rear. Recovered, del Burgo co-organized the Álavese battalion of Tercio de Nuestra Señora de Begoña and as its officer re-entered combat in Biscay. Reportedly shocked by destruction of Guernica, he engaged in a related brawl against an army officer and deployed a requeté platoon safeguarding the symbolic oak. In mid-June 1937 captain del Burgo was heavily wounded when storming the Bilbao Iron Ring. Evacuated, he has never returned to the frontline, serving as Delegado de Requetés del Seńorío de Vizcaya.\n\nDuring the of early 1937 del Burgo sided with the intransigent falcondistas, considering amalgamation into FET a manipulation on part of the Navarrese. He labeled occasional enthusiasm for unification a \"collective psychosis\". To underline Traditionalist identity, he was commissioned to compile a concise doctrinal handbook, published in April 1937 as \"Ideario Tradicionalista\". Some scholars claim that the collaborationists intended to get rid of del Burgo, still active in national AET, and send him abroad, as a Traditionalist tutor of Don Juan. Late 1937 Fal considered del Burgo a man of trust and included him on the list of potential replacements for the disloyal members of Navarrese junta, sent to the provincial leader Baleztena. As the latter preferred to steer cautiously between and falcondistas and ignored the suggestion, it was only in 1939 that del Burgo entered the executive of Hermandad de los Caballeros Voluntarios de la Cruz, intended as semi-official Fal’s outpost in Navarre. In 1940 Fal appointed him to represent Navarre in a vasco-navarrese junta, though de Burgo’s opposition to unification was already burning out and giving way to sense of defeat, resignation and frustration.\nDel Burgo’s departure from the falcondista camp stemmed not from differences on policy towards Francoism, but was the result of dynastical disputes. Though in the mid-1930s he was fanatically loyal to the dynasty, following the death of Don Alfonso Carlos del Burgo only hesitantly accepted the regency of Don Javier; instead, he advanced the cause of Don Carlo Pio as early as on the frontline in 1937. When the latter officially raised his claim as Carlos VIII in 1943, del Burgo joined his followers - dubbed carloctavistas - and constructed a supporting dynastical interpretation. Unlike many Carlos VIII supporters he did not sympathize with the Axis and did not enter the first carloctavista executive of 1943. It was only in 1945 that del Burgo became one of the Comunión Católico-Monárquica leaders and vice-president of the claimant’s Navarrese Royal Council. Don Carlos Pio was only 3 years del Burgo’s senior and equally radical; the two have forged a close relationship and exchanged a lengthy correspondence over the years. In the late 1940s Del Burgo’s worked to capture new supporters and in 1950 he managed to reconstruct Navarrese AET as a carloctavista organization. However, at that time he was replaced as a key claimant's man in the province by .\n\nThe unexpected 1953 death of Don Carlos Pio left the carloctavistas puzzled. While most of the group focused on Carlos VIII's older brother Don Antonio and minor factions backed either his sons or another brother Francisco Jose, del Burgo advocated allegiance to the oldest daughter of Carlos VIII, Alejandra. According to del Burgo, having been a minor she would appear as \"abanderada provisional\", until the claim is passed to her anticipated male descendant. This option received scarce support and no faction was built around it. Del Burgo was left without clear dynastical allegiances; over time he developed a critical view of Carlos VIII, considering him \"sold out\" to Falange. He is not listed among the carloctavistas forming the camp of subsequent carloctavista claimants, those reconciling with Don Javier, or those joining Don Juan. though in the 1960s it was noted that he \"había mostrado inclinación hacia los javieristas\"\n\nDel Burgo’s access to the carloctavista camp made him reconsider his stand versus Francoism, as Don Carlos Pio pursued a decisively collaborationist strategy. In 1942, during the proceeding fragmentation and bewilderment of Navarrese Carlism, he stood on the carloctavista ticket in local elections to the Pamplona council and was successful, serving as until 1944. By this token, in 1943 and 1944 he performed the prestigious sanfermines task of setting off . The council role did necessarily imply collaboration, but promotion to colonel, 1943 appointment as a provincial Falangist delegate for communication and transport and vice secretary of FET Educación Popular section clearly did, especially that in the mid-1940s he openly started to advocate a possibilist policy. As in 1949 the Falangist zealot Luis Valero Bermejo was appointed a new provincial civil governor del Burgo was his man of trust, though when himself offered the jobs of civil governor of Lerida and Lugo he declined, claiming that he would never accept a post beyond Navarre. In 1950 he assumed the role of a provincial ministerial delegate for tourism and information. When the carloctavista collaborationism crashed with the death of Don Carlos Pio, del Burgo was left disoriented.\n\nIn the mid-1950s it was the mainstream Carlism which in turn commenced a possibilist strategy, with intransigence abandoned and Fal replaced by Valiente. None of the sources consulted offers any information on a would-be rapprochement (or hostility) between del Burgo and the Javieristas, though his \"Ideario\" still served as their doctrinal point of reference. In 1958 he was appointed as representative of Navarre in the Falangist , a largely fictitious executive body which nevertheless automatically guaranteed membership in the Francoist quasi-parliament, Cortes Españolas; it is not clear what if any background mechanism elevated him to the position. Del Burgo served in Comisión de Leyes Fundamentales, though there is no information available on his stand versus the constitutional laws discussed. Though re-appointed in 1961, he did not have his ticket prolonged in 1964; according to some sources, he resigned due to differences with Francoism.\n\nAs a former radical aetista and an active collaborationist, he would have seemed a potential ally for the new generation of Carlist progressists, also revolutionary, socially-minded, AET members and apparently keen to exploit possibilist opportunities within Francoism. However, they preferred to jump on the older version of de Mella’s sociedalismo and there is no trace of any link between del Burgo and the hugocarlistas. One source suggests that as Delegado del Ministerio de Información y Turismo he sabotaged their plans, preventing the presence of Carlos Hugo at the annual Montejurra gathering in 1964. Del Burgo is not mentioned as taking part in power struggle between Traditionalists and Progressists, which erupted within Carlism in the late 1960s, though he maintained at least private contacts with Traditionalists like Manuel Fal Conde in 1969.\n\nAlready in May 1936 del Burgo won the contest for the job of an auxiliar at Archivo de la Diputación Foral de Navarra. Following the Civil War pause, in 1939 he resumed the civil servant career; at that time the provincial Navarrese government decided to detach the existing Biblioteca de Navarra from Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza and establish it as a stand-alone ; del Burgo became the first head and organizer of the new unit. He remained at its helm for the next 43 years, presiding over its opening in 1941, removal from building to \"La Agrícola\" on Plaza de San Fernando in 1972 and re-formatting it from a scholarly institute to the Navarrese public library. On top of this job, in 1941 del Burgo became head of Red de Bibliotecas de Navarra, the provincial network of local libraries, in course of his service having opened 65 public libraries across the province. Until the late 20th century he remained active in professional archivist and librarian organizations.\n\nIn 1950 del Burgo became the provincial delegate of Ministry of Information and Tourism. At this position he acted as head of the Navarrese Francoist censorship office, banning a number of films, theatric performances, books and songs; he is particularly remembered for censoring the marketing campaign of \"The Mark of Zorro\" movie; the original advertising slogan, \"El Zorro, friend of the poor, feared by tyrants\" apparently sounded too hazardous for the regime. In 1964 del Burgo left the ministry and assumed the job of Director de Turismo, Bibliotecas y Cultura Popular de la Diputación Foral de Navarra. Having been responsible for mass culture, he edited and published around 400 popular brochures - writing some of them himself - and organized hundreds of cultural events, mostly highlighting traditionalist values at the expense of democratic ones. By some sources he is described as periodista. As head of tourism del Burgo promoted the province across Spain, developed the Navarrese section of El Camino de Santiago, drafted \"Ordenación Turística\" (1964) for the entire trail and wrote tourist guides related to Navarre. Since the late 1960s he was also director of Escuela Municipal de Artes aplicadas y Oficios artísticos. Resigned from all public posts in 1982, a month before his 70th birthday.\n\nAs a historian del Burgo focused on – if not limited himself to – Carlism and Navarre, with a clear preference for the 19th and 20th centuries and for the history of foralism. His works range from syntheses to monographs, biographies and case studies. As an amateur with no systematic training, he did not adhere to any specific methodology, though he remained chiefly within the limits of political history and based his studies on thorough research in primary sources, mostly the printed ones.\n\nDel Burgo’s key historical work is the monumental \"Bibliografía de las guerras carlistas\" (1953-1966), the opus which spanned across 5 volumes, cost 25 years of work and indexed more that 10,000 works; until today it remains a point of reference for all students of the subject. Second to be listed is \"Historia General de Navarra\" (1978), a massive synthesis of the region’s past, heavily based on his earlier works and the result of 10-year-research. Then come detailed studies related to the history of Carlism and Navarre, most prominent of them \"Carlos VII y su tiempo\" (1994) and \"La sucesión de Carlos II\" (1967). Del Burgo is also the author of \"Conspiración y guerra civil\" (1970), the work intended as a synthesis, though today it is – somewhat unintentionally – broadly used rather as a historical source. Finally, he authored a number of minor publications ranging from petty contributions to popular booklets, like \"Vida y hechos militares del mariscal de campo Don Juan Manuel Sarasa narrados por él mismo\". Many of his works form part of auxiliary sciences, bibliography or metabibliography, source criticism, or prosopography.\n\nAs a historian del Burgo is praised for sound referential basis; the critics usually point to his Carlist bias. He is particularly criticized for an attempt to recalculate the number of victims of the Rightist terror in Navarre; other historians support 4 times higher figures. This controversy coincides with the fact that del Burgo was personally accused of a war crime, the charge that left him very embittered and which he always denied; it is also disqualified by some historians. As an amateur he has never assumed academic duties, though he became member-correspondent of ; for his bibliographical work del Burgo received the National Literary Prize in 1967.\n\nDel Burgo commenced his literary career in the early 1930s, publishing short dramas revolving around episodes from the Carlist history and sometimes played at the local party circulos: \"Lealtad\" (1932), \"Cruzados\" (1934) and \"Al borde de la traición\" (1936). Calibrated as praises of old Carlist virtues and with clear moralizing objectives, they are classified as costumbrismo nostalgico. In 1937 he tried his hand as a poet with \"En Pos. Ensayo poético\". Following the Civil War break del Burgo switched to novels: \"El valle perdido\" (1942), \"Huracán\" (1943) and \"Lo que buscamos\" (1951). Set in the history of the Civil War, the first two were designed to acclaim patriotic merits and presented a traditional narrative style, though with plots accommodating magical threads; the third one assumed a different tone, infected with bitterness and naturalism. After the break of the 1960s and 1970s, dedicated mostly to historical research, del Burgo returned to drama with \"Llamada sin respuesta\" (1978), to poetry with \"Soliloquios: en busca de un rayo de luz perdido\" (1998) and to prose with \"La Cruz del fuego\" (2000), a well-documented adventurous intrigue from the times of Henry I of Navarre.\nThough hevaily contributing to Carlism in literature, Del Burgo has not made it to the history of Spanish belles-lettres of the 20th century, be it either general synthetic accounts or encyclopedias and dictionaries. He is missing even in detailed studies on the Francoist era novels. His prose is classified as falling into the \"novela de la guerra civil española\" category. Appreciated for documentary value, del Burgo’s novels are described as production of scarce esthetic and literary value, very repetitive in terms of its structures, primitive in terms of narration and Manichaean in terms of personalities. Present-day scholars point to two interesting features of his novels. One is a strong Basque ethnic sentiment, calibrated in pre-nationalist, sabinan terms of an ancient Basque Eden. Another is equally idyllic rustic thread, advancing a fairly typical Carlist praise of ruralismo and mistrust towards urban life.\n\nDel Burgo’s novelist work was acknowledged by Premio de Literatura y Periodismo de la Secretaria General de FET (1954). Apart from the national prize of 1967, he was also rewarded by the Bayonne-Pamplona International Competition Award (1963), Fundacion de Larramendi Award (1993) and Badge of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise (1997), conceded by the Ministry of Education and received in Pamplona in May 1999 from the then Minister of Education and Culture, Mariano Rajoy. Permanent Councilor of Institución Príncipe de Viana, himself he has never received the , set up in 1990 and awarded by the .\n\n\n\n"}

It was originally written in Spanish and was published by Random House Mondadori on 22 September 2007, and Random House Inc. of New York on 4 October 2007.\n\nThe book describes the five years-long (1982-1987) romantic relationship of the author with Pablo Escobar, head of the Medellin cartel, and it became instantly the #1 bestseller in Colombia, Latin America, and the Hispanic market in the United States. It has been translated to sixteen languages, and inspired the movie \"Loving Pablo\" (2017).\n\nVallejo’s memoir is also her personal intimate biography of Pablo Escobar; a moving and terrible love story with many facets, but also a historical document about Colombian tragedies and political corruption in the second part of the 20th century.\n\nThe book is divided in an introduction and three parts: The Days of Innocence and Dreams; The Days of Splendor and Terror; and The Days of Absence and Silence.\n\nIn the Introduction, Virginia Vallejo describes her departure from Colombia on 18 July 2006 in a special flight of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), after she has accused a former senator and minister of justice, Alberto Santofimio, of instigating the assassination of a former presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan, and after she had offered her cooperation to the Department of Justice in ongoing high-profile criminal cases.\n\nThe story begins with the joy and passion of two new lovers -Pablo, an ambitious rookie politician from humble origins, and Virginia, a socialite and media personality, both 32 years old- and continues with the evolution of their relationship and Escobar’s personality during his war against the extradition treaty between Colombia and the United States, and the terrorist activities of him and the Medellin cartel in their last years.\n\nLike a snowball, Vallejo describes the birth and boom of the cocaine industry that turned her lover into a billionaire, thanks to the cooperation of leading politicians; the origins of the Colombian rebel organizations, and the paramilitary squads founded by Escobar and his partners; the assassinations of the justice minister Rodrigo Lara in 1984, and the siege of the Palace of Justice in 1985; the suffering of the journalist after she had ended her relationship with the drug kingpin in 1987, and her cooperation with the anti drug German agency BKA in 1988; the Cuban connection, and the bombing of an airplane with 110 people on board in 1989 (Avianca Flight 203); the assassination of Luis Carlos Galán, and three more presidential candidates; the origins of Escobar’s war against the Cali cartel and the Colombian state, followed by the era of narcoterrorism from 1988 to 1993; the coalition of enforcement agencies and Escobar’s enemies involved in his hunt; and, finally, the worldwide reaction to the death of the Number One Enemy of the United States on 2 December 1993.\n\nThe release of the book created a political scandal in Latin America and the Hispanic television channels in the USA, due to Vallejo’s description of the relationship of Pablo Escobar and the Medellin and Cali cartels with several presidents - like Alvaro Uribe, Alfonso López and Ernesto Samper - and Colombian enforcement agencies. Thanks to Vallejo’s revelations, the Colombian government reopened the so-called \"cases of the century\": the siege of the Palace of Justice, followed by a massacre of more than 100 people, including eleven Supreme Court Justices, committed by the army; and the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan in 1989.\n\nVallejo’s book was commented by The New York Times and El País of Madrid, among hundreds of media worldwide. Also, by Colombian, Venezuelan and Ecuadorian presidents, a former American ambassador to Bogota, human rights organizations, and the rebel FARC. \n\nIn 2008 and 2009, president Rafael Correa of Ecuador showed \"\"Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar\" on television.\n\nOn 3 June 2010, the United States of America granted political asylum to the Colombian author under the precepts of the American Constitution, the Geneva Convention Against Torture, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The decision of the judge was based on Virginia Vallejo’s career of decades as a journalist; her testimonies under oath in historic criminal cases that resulted in lengthy convictions; her description of atrocities and massacres in her book and in the court; the threats that she had received from members of the Colombian Government and the paramilitary; and the brutal character assassination of the journalist in media owned by presidential families or their powerful associates, all of them documented in hundreds of pages of evidence and later erased from the Internet.\n\nAccording to the author’s agent, Liepman AG of Zürich, the book \"Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar\" will be released in foreign languages during 2017. The countries and publishers are, in alphabetical order:\n\nThe Greek, Polish, Brazilian, Dutch and Finnish books were released in the first semester of 2017; the rest came out in late 2017 and early 2018. Planeta released \"Amando a Pablo, odiando a Escobar\"\" in Spain on 25 October 2017. The Latin American releases have not been confirmed yet. Vintage-Knopf Doubleday launched both the Spanish and English titles in North America on 29 May 2018.\n\nThe film Loving Pablo is based on Vallejo’s book, and was released on 6 September 2017 during the 74th Venice Film Festival. The role of the journalist is played by Penélope Cruz, while the drug kingpin by Javier Bardem, both winners of the Oscar of the Academy of Hollywood as best supporting actors.\n\n"}

She was a founding member of both the Jack of Diamonds, Moscow's first radical independent exhibiting group, and the art movement known as Der Blaue Reiter. Born in Russia, she moved to Paris in 1921 and lived there until her death.\n\nNatalia Sergeevna Goncharova was born on July 3, 1881, in Nagaevo (now in the Chernsky District of Tula Oblast). Her father, Sergey Mikhaylovich Goncharov, was an architect and graduate of the prestigious Moscow Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. Goncharova moved to Moscow at the age of 10 in 1892; she graduated from the Fourth Women's Gymnasium in 1898.\n\nIn 1901 Goncharova began her own studies at the Moscow Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture as a sculptor, under Pavel Trubetskoi, who was associated with the World of Art movement. By 1903, she began exhibiting in major Russian salons. She was awarded a silver medal for sculpture in 1903-04. It was at the Moscow Institute that Goncharova met fellow-student Mikhail Larionov, and not long afterwards they began sharing a studio and living space. She withdrew from the Moscow Institute in 1909, and in 1910, after a number of students were expelled from Konstantin Korovin's portrait class for imitating the contemporary style of European Modernism, Goncharova, Larionov, Robert Falk, Pyotr Konchalovsky, Alexander Kuprin, Ilya Mashkov and others formed Moscow's first radical independent exhibiting group, the Jack of Diamonds.\n\nThe Jack of Diamonds' first exhibition (December 1910-11) included Primitivist and Cubist paintings by Goncharova, and in the later Donkey's Tail exhibition (March–April 1912) organized by Larionov, more than fifty of her paintings were on display. Goncharova drew inspirations for primitivism from Russian icons and folk art, otherwise known as luboks. The Donkey's Tail was conceived as an intentional break from European art influence and the establishment of an independent Russian school of modern art. The exhibition proved controversial, and the censor confiscated Goncharova's religiously-themed work, \"The Evangelists\" (1910–11), deeming it blasphemous for it to be hung at an exhibition titled after the rear end of a donkey. Goncharova and her counterpart, Larionov, were continuously harassed for their artwork and the way they expressed themselves. However, the influence of Russian Futurism is much in evidence in Goncharova's later paintings. Initially preoccupied with icon painting and the primitivism of ethnic Russian folk-art, Goncharova became famous in Russia for her Futurist work such as \"The Cyclist\" and her later Rayonist works. Goncharova and Larionav painted hieroglyphics and flowers on their faces and walked the streets as a part of a primitivist art movement. Goncharova herself sometimes appears topless in public with symbols on her chest. As leaders of the Moscow Futurists, they organized provocative lecture evenings in the same vein as their Italian counterparts. Goncharova was also involved with graphic design—writing and illustrating several avant-garde books.\n\nShe started to exhibit at the Salon d'Automne (\"Exposition de L'art Russe\") beginning in 1906.\n\nGoncharova was a member of the avant-garde Der Blaue Reiter group from its founding in 1911. In 1915, she began to design ballet costumes and sets in Geneva. In 1915 she started work on a series of designs—\"Six Winged Seraph\", \"Angel\", \"St. Andrew\", \"St. Mark\", \"Nativity\", and others—for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev to be titled \"Liturgy\". Also involved in the project, for which Igor Stravinsky was invited to compose the score, were Larionov and Léonide Massine, but the ballet never materialized. Goncharova moved to Paris in 1921 where she designed a number of stage sets of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. She also exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in 1921, and participated regularly at the Salon des Tuileries and the Salon des Indépendants.\n\nGoncharova and Larionav collaborated on four charity events in Moscow. These events were the Grand Bal des Aristes, the Bal Banal, the Bal Olympique, and the Grand Ourse Bal. They both designed much of the publicity materials for the event.\n\nBetween 1922 and 1926 Goncharova created fashion designs for Marie Cuttoli's shop, Maison Myrbor on the Rue Vincent, Paris. Her richly embroidered and appliquéd dress designs were strongly influenced by Russian folk art, Byzantine mosaic and her work for the Ballets Russes.\n\nIn 1938 Goncharova became a French citizen. On June 2, 1955, four years after Larionov suffered a stroke, the two artists got married in Paris to safeguard their rights of inheritance. Goncharova died seven years later, on October 17, 1962, in Paris after a debilitating struggle with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nGoncharova's work can be found in a number of public institutions, including:\n\nOn June 18, 2007, Goncharova's 1909 painting \"Picking Apples\" was auctioned at Christie's for $9.8 million, setting a record for any female artist at the time. She is considered one of the most expensive women artists at auction, and her work features in Russian art auctions during the bi-annual Russian Art Week in London.\n\nIn November 2007, \"Bluebells\", (1909), brought £3.1 million ($6.2 million). In 2008, Goncharova's 1912 still-life \"The Flowers\" (formerly part of Guillaume Apollinaire's collection) sold for $10.8 million.\n\nThe copyright in the Estate of Natalia Goncharova is administered by ADAGP, Paris.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39301", "title": "Orientalism", "text": "Orientalism\n\nOrientalism is a term used by art historians and literary and cultural studies scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects in West Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and East Asian cultures. These depictions are usually done by writers, designers, and artists from the West. In particular, Orientalist painting, depicting more specifically \"the Middle East\", was one of the many specialisms of 19th-century academic art, and the literature of Western countries took a similar interest in Oriental themes.\n\nSince the publication of Edward Said's \"Orientalism\" in 1978, much academic discourse has begun to use the term \"Orientalism\" to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian, and North African societies. In Said's analysis, the West essentializes these societies as static and undeveloped—thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior.\n\nOrientalism refers to the Orient, in reference and opposition to the Occident; the East and the West, respectively. The word Orient entered the English language as the Middle French \"orient\". The root word \"oriēns\", from the Latin \"Oriēns\", has synonymous denotations: The eastern part of the world; the sky whence comes the sun; the east; the rising sun, etc.; yet the denotation changed as a term of geography. In the \"Monk's Tale\" (1375), Geoffrey Chaucer wrote: \"That they conquered many regnes grete / In the orient, with many a fair citee.\" The term \"orient\" refers to countries east of the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Europe. \"In Place of Fear\" (1952), Aneurin Bevan used an expanded denotation of the Orient that comprehended East Asia: \"the awakening of the Orient under the impact of Western ideas\". Edward Said said that Orientalism \"enables the political, economic, cultural and social domination of the West, not just during colonial times, but also in the present.\"\n\nIn art history, the term Orientalism refers to the works of the Western artists who specialized in Oriental subjects, produced from their travels in Western Asia, during the 19th century. In that time, artists and scholars were described as Orientalists, especially in France, where the dismissive use of the term \"Orientalist\" was made popular by the art critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary. Despite such social disdain for a style of representational art, the French Society of Orientalist Painters was founded in 1893, with Jean-Léon Gérôme as the honorary president; whereas in Britain, the term Orientalist identified \"an artist\".\n\nThe formation of the French Orientalist Painters Society changed the consciousness of practitioners towards the end of the 19th century, since artists could now see themselves as part of a distinct art movement. As an art movement, Orientalist painting is generally treated as one of the many branches of 19th-century academic art; however, many different styles of Orientalist art were in evidence. Art historians tend to identify two broad types of Orientalist artist: the realists who carefully painted what they observed and those who imagined Orientalist scenes without ever leaving the studio. French painters such as Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863) and Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904) are widely regarded as the leading luminaries of the Orientalist movement.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the term Orientalist identified a scholar who specialized in the languages and literatures of the Eastern world. Among such scholars were British officials of the East India Company, who said that the Arab culture, the culture of India, and the Islamic cultures should be studied as equal to the cultures of Europe. Among such scholars is the philologist William Jones, whose studies of Indo-European languages established modern philology. British imperial strategy in India favored Orientalism as a technique for developing good relations with the natives—until the 1820s, when the influence of \"anglicists\" such as Thomas Babington Macaulay and John Stuart Mill led to the promotion of Anglocentric education.\n\nAdditionally, Hebraism and Jewish studies gained popularity among British and German scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries. The academic field of Oriental studies, which comprehended the cultures of the Near East and the Far East, became the fields of Asian studies and Middle Eastern studies.\n\nIn the book \"Orientalism\" (1978), the cultural critic Edward Said redefined the term Orientalism to describe a pervasive Western tradition — academic and artistic — of prejudiced outsider-interpretations of the Eastern world, which was shaped by the cultural attitudes of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries. The thesis of \"Orientalism\" develops Antonio Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony, and Michel Foucault's theorisation of discourse (the knowledge-and-power relation) to criticise the scholarly tradition of Oriental studies. Said criticised contemporary scholars who perpetuated the tradition of outsider-interpretation of Arabo-Islamic cultures, especially Bernard Lewis and Fouad Ajami.\n\nThe analyses are of Orientalism in European literature, especially French literature, and do not analyse visual art and Orientalist painting. In that vein, the art historian Linda Nochlin applied Said's methods of critical analysis to art, \"with uneven results\". In the academy, the book \"Orientalism\" (1978) became a foundational text of post-colonial cultural studies. Moreover, in relation to the cultural institution of citizenship, Orientalism has rendered the concept of \"citizenship\" as a problem of epistemology, because citizenship originated as a social institution of the Western world; as such, the problem of defining citizenship reconfigures the idea of \"Europe\" in time of crises.\n\nFurthermore, Said said that Orientalism, as an \"idea of representation is a theoretical one: The Orient is a stage on which the whole East is confined\" in order to make the Eastern world \"less fearsome to the West\"; that the developing world, primarily the West, is the cause of colonialism. Moreover, in \"Empire: A Very Short Introduction\" (2000), Stephen Howe agreed with Said that Western nations and their empires were created by the exploitation of underdeveloped countries, by the extraction of wealth and labour from one country to another country.\n\nThe Moresque style of Renaissance ornament is a European adaptation of the Islamic arabesque that began in the late 15th century and was to be used in some types of work, such as bookbinding, until almost the present day. Early architectural use of motifs lifted from the Indian subcontinent is known as Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture. One of the earliest examples is the façade of Guildhall, London (1788–1789). The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of views of India by William Hodges, and William and Thomas Daniell from about 1795. Examples of \"Hindoo\" architecture are Sezincote House (c. 1805) in Gloucestershire, built for a nabob returned from Bengal, and the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.\n\n\"Turquerie\", which began as early as the late 15th century, continued until at least the 18th century, and included both the use of \"Turkish\" styles in the decorative arts, the adoption of Turkish costume at times, and interest in art depicting the Ottoman Empire itself. Venice, the traditional trading partner of the Ottomans, was the earliest centre, with France becoming more prominent in the 18th century.\n\n\"Chinoiserie\" is the catch-all term for the fashion for Chinese themes in decoration in Western Europe, beginning in the late 17th century and peaking in waves, especially Rococo Chinoiserie, \"c.\" 1740–1770. From the Renaissance to the 18th century, Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of Chinese ceramics with only partial success. Early hints of Chinoiserie appeared in the 17th century in nations with active East India companies: England (the East India Company), Denmark (the Danish East India Company), the Netherlands (the Dutch East India Company) and France (the French East India Company). Tin-glazed pottery made at Delft and other Dutch towns adopted genuine Ming-era blue and white porcelain from the early 17th century. Early ceramic wares made at Meissen and other centers of true porcelain imitated Chinese shapes for dishes, vases and teawares (see Chinese export porcelain).\n\nPleasure pavilions in \"Chinese taste\" appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German palaces, and in tile panels at Aranjuez near Madrid. Thomas Chippendale's mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, \"c.\" 1753–70. Sober \"homages\" to early Xing scholars' furnishings were also naturalized, as the \"tang\" evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs that suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream \"chinoiserie\". Chinoiserie media included imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated japanning, early painted wallpapers in sheets, and ceramic figurines and table ornaments. Small pagodas appeared on chimneypieces and full-sized ones in gardens. Kew has a magnificent garden pagoda designed by William Chambers. The Wilhelma (1846) in Stuttgart is an example of Moorish Revival architecture. Leighton House, built for the artist Frederic Leighton, has a conventional facade but elaborate Arab-style interiors, including original Islamic tiles and other elements as well as Victorian Orientalizing work.\n\nAfter 1860, \"Japonism,\" sparked by the importing of ukiyo-e, became an important influence in the western arts. In particular, many modern French artists such as Claude Monet and Edgar Degas were influenced by the Japanese style. Mary Cassatt, an American artist who worked in France, used elements of combined patterns, flat planes and shifting perspective of Japanese prints in her own images. The paintings of James Abbott McNeill Whistler's \"The Peacock Room\" demonstrated how he used aspects of Japanese tradition and are some of the finest works of the genre. California architects Greene and Greene were inspired by Japanese elements in their design of the Gamble House and other buildings.\n\nEgyptian Revival architecture became popular in the early and mid-19th century and continued as a minor style into the early 20th century. Moorish Revival architecture began in the early 19th century in the German states and was particularly popular for building synagogues. Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture was a genre that arose in the late 19th century in the British Raj.\n\nDepictions of Islamic \"Moors\" and \"Turks\" (imprecisely named Muslim groups of southern Europe, North Africa and West Asia) can be found in Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque art. In Biblical scenes in Early Netherlandish painting, secondary figures, especially Romans, were given exotic costumes that distantly reflected the clothes of the Near East. The Three Magi in Nativity scenes were an especial focus for this. In general art with Biblical settings would not be considered as Orientalist except where contemporary or historicist Middle Eastern detail or settings is a feature of works, as with some paintings by Gentile Bellini and others, and a number of 19th century works. Renaissance Venice had a phase of particular interest in depictions of the Ottoman Empire in painting and prints. Gentile Bellini, who travelled to Constantinople and painted the Sultan, and Vittore Carpaccio were the leading painters. By then the depictions were more accurate, with men typically dressed all in white. The depiction of Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting sometimes draws from Orientalist interest, but more often just reflects the prestige these expensive objects had in the period.\n\nJean-Étienne Liotard (1702–1789) visited Istanbul and painted numerous pastels of Turkish domestic scenes; he also continued to wear Turkish attire for much of the time when he was back in Europe. The ambitious Scottish 18th-century artist Gavin Hamilton found a solution to the problem of using modern dress, considered unheroic and inelegant, in history painting by using Middle Eastern settings with Europeans wearing local costume, as travelers were advised to do. His huge \"James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of Palmyra\" (1758, now Edinburgh) elevates tourism to the heroic, with the two travelers wearing what look very like togas. Many travelers had themselves painted in exotic Eastern dress on their return, including Lord Byron, as did many who had never left Europe, including Madame de Pompadour. The growing French interest in exotic Oriental luxury and lack of liberty in the 18th century to some extent reflected a pointed analogy with France's own absolute monarchy. Byron's poetry was highly influential in introducing Europe to the heady cocktail of Romanticism in exotic Oriental settings which was to dominate 19th century Oriental art.\n\nFrench Orientalist painting was transformed by Napoleon's ultimately unsuccessful invasion of Egypt and Syria in 1798–1801, which stimulated great public interest in Egyptology, and was also recorded in subsequent years by Napoleon's court painters, especially Antoine-Jean Gros, although the Middle Eastern campaign was not one on which he accompanied the army. Two of his most successful paintings, \"Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa\" (1804) and \"Battle of Abukir\" (1806) focus on the Emperor, as he was by then, but include many Egyptian figures, as does the less effective \"Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids\" (1810). Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson's \"La Révolte du Caire\" (1810) was another large and prominent example. A well-illustrated \"Description de l'Égypte\" was published by the French Government in twenty volumes between 1809 and 1828, concentrating on antiquities.\n\nEugène Delacroix's first great success, \"The Massacre at Chios\" (1824) was painted before he visited Greece or the East, and followed his friend Théodore Géricault's \"The Raft of the Medusa\" in showing a recent incident in distant parts that had aroused public opinion. Greece was still fighting for independence from the Ottomans, and was effectively as exotic as the more Near Eastern parts of the empire. Delacroix followed up with \"Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi\" (1827), commemorating a siege of the previous year, and \"The Death of Sardanapalus\", inspired by Lord Byron, which although set in antiquity has been credited with beginning the mixture of sex, violence, lassitude and exoticism which runs through much French Orientalist painting. In 1832, Delacroix finally visited what is now Algeria, recently conquered by the French, and Morocco, as part of a diplomatic mission to the Sultan of Morocco. He was greatly struck by what he saw, comparing the North African way of life to that of the Ancient Romans, and continued to paint subjects from his trip on his return to France. Like many later Orientalist painters, he was frustrated by the difficulty of sketching women, and many of his scenes featured Jews or warriors on horses. However, he was apparently able to get into the women's' quarters or harem of a house to sketch what became \"Women of Algiers\"; few later harem scenes had this claim to authenticity.\nWhen Ingres, the director of the French \"Académie de peinture\", painted a highly colored vision of a \"Turkish bath\", he made his eroticized Orient publicly acceptable by his diffuse generalizing of the female forms (who might all have been the same model). More open sensuality was seen as acceptable in the exotic Orient. This imagery persisted in art into the early 20th century, as evidenced in Henri Matisse's orientalist semi-nudes from his Nice period, and his use of Oriental costumes and patterns. Ingres' pupil Théodore Chassériau (1819–1856) had already achieved success with his nude \"The Toilette of Esther\" (1841, Louvre) and equestrian portrait of \"Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort\" (1846) before he first visited the East, but in later decades the steamship made travel much easier and increasing numbers of artists traveled to the Middle East and beyond, painting a wide range of Oriental scenes.\n\nIn many of these works, they portrayed the Orient as exotic, colorful and sensual, not to say stereotyped. Such works typically concentrated on Arab, Jewish, and other Semitic cultures, as those were the ones visited by artists as France became more engaged in North Africa. French artists such as Eugène Delacroix, Jean-Léon Gérôme and Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres painted many works depicting Islamic culture, often including lounging odalisques. They stressed both lassitude and visual spectacle. Other scenes, especially in genre painting, have been seen as either closely comparable to their equivalents set in modern-day or historical Europe, or as also reflecting an Orientalist mind-set in the Saidian sense of the term. Gérôme was the precursor, and often the master, of a number of French painters in the later part of the century whose works were often frankly salacious, frequently featuring scenes in harems, public baths and slave auctions (the last two also available with classical decor), and responsible, with others, for \"the equation of Orientalism with the nude in pornographic mode\"; (\"Gallery, below\")\n\nThough British political interest in the territories of the unravelling Ottoman Empire was as intense as in France, it was mostly more discreetly exercised. The origins of British Orientalist 19th-century painting owe more to religion than military conquest or the search for plausible locations for naked women. The leading British genre painter, Sir David Wilkie was 55 when he travelled to Istanbul and Jerusalem in 1840, dying off Gibraltar during the return voyage. Though not noted as a religious painter, Wilkie made the trip with a Protestant agenda to reform religious painting, as he believed that: \"a Martin Luther in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered\", by which he meant traditional Christian iconography. He hoped to find more authentic settings and decor for Biblical subjects at their original location, though his death prevented more than studies being made. Other artists including the Pre-Raphaelite William Holman Hunt and David Roberts had similar motivations, giving an emphasis on realism in British Orientalist art from the start. The French artist James Tissot also used contemporary Middle Eastern landscape and decor for Biblical subjects, with little regard for historical costumes or other fittings.\n\nWilliam Holman Hunt produced a number of major paintings of Biblical subjects drawing on his Middle Eastern travels, improvising variants of contemporary Arab costume and furnishings to avoid specifically Islamic styles, and also some landscapes and genre subjects. The biblical subjects included \"The Scapegoat\" (1856), \"The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple\" (1860), and \"The Shadow of Death\" (1871). \"The Miracle of the Holy Fire\" (1899) was intended as a picturesque satire on the local Eastern Christians, of whom, like most English visitors, Hunt took a very dim view. His \"A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship\" (1854–61) is a rare contemporary narrative scene, as the young man feels his fiancé's face, which he is not allowed to see, through her veil, as a Westerner in the background beats his way up the street with his stick. This a rare intrusion of a clearly contemporary figure into an Orientalist scene; mostly they claim the picturesqueness of the historical painting so popular at the time, without the trouble of researching authentic costumes and settings.\n\nWhen Gérôme exhibited \"For Sale; Slaves at Cairo\" at the Royal Academy in London in 1871, it was \"widely found offensive\", perhaps partly because the British liked to think they had successfully suppressed the slave trade in Egypt, also for cruelty and \"representing fleshiness for its own sake\". But Rana Kabbani believes that \"French Orientalist painting, as exemplified by the works of Gérôme, may appear more sensual, gaudy, gory and sexually explicit than its British counterpart, but this is a difference of style not substance ... Similar strains of fascination and repulsion convulsed their artists\" Nonetheless, nudity and violence are more evident in British paintings set in the ancient world, and \"the iconography of the \"odalisque\" ... the Oriental sex slave whose image is offered up to the viewer as freely as she herself supposedly was to her master – is almost entirely French in origin\", though taken up with enthusiasm by Italian and other painters.\n\nJohn Frederick Lewis, who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in Cairo, painted highly detailed works showing both realistic genre scenes of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with no traces of Western cultural influence yet apparent. His careful and seemingly affectionate representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including Gérôme in his later works. He \"never painted a nude\", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes, which, with the rare examples by the classicist painter Lord Leighton, imagine \"the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women's fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks\".\n\nOther artists concentrated on landscape painting, often of desert scenes, including Richard Dadd and Edward Lear. David Roberts (1796–1864) produced architectural and landscape views, many of antiquities, and published very successful books of lithographs from them.\n\nRussian Orientalist art was largely concerned with the areas of Central Asia that Russia was conquering during the century, and also in historical painting with the Mongols who had dominated Russia for much of the Middle Ages, who were rarely shown in a good light. Nationalist historical painting in Central Europe and the Balkans dwelt on Turkish oppression, with battle scenes and maidens about to be raped.\n\nThe Saidian analysis has not prevented a strong revival of interest in, and collecting of, 19th century Orientalist works since the 1970s, the latter was in large part led by Middle Eastern buyers.\n\nAuthors and composers are not commonly referred to as \"Orientalist\" in the way that artists are, and relatively few specialized in Oriental topics or styles, or are even best known for their works including them. But many major figures, from Mozart to Flaubert, have produced significant works with Oriental subjects or treatments. Lord Byron with his four long \"Turkish tales\" in poetry, is one of the most important writers to make exotic fantasy Oriental settings a significant theme in the literature of Romanticism. Verdi's opera \"Aida\" (1871) is set in Egypt as portrayed through the content and the visual spectacle. \"Aida\" depicts a militaristic Egypt's tyranny over Ethiopia.\n\nIrish Orientalism had a particular character, drawing on various beliefs about early historical links between Ireland and the East, few of which are now regarded as historically correct. The mythical Milesians are one example of this. The Irish were also conscious of the views of other nations seeing them as comparably backward to the East, and Europe's \"backyard Orient\".\n\nIn music, Orientalism may be applied to styles occurring in different periods, such as the \"alla Turca\", used by multiple composers including Mozart and Beethoven. The American musicologist Richard Taruskin has identified in 19th-century Russian music a strain of Orientalism: \"the East as a sign or metaphor, as imaginary geography, as historical fiction, as the reduced and totalized other against which we construct our (not less reduced and totalized) sense of ourselves\". Taruskin concedes Russian composers, unlike those in France and Germany, felt an \"ambivalence\" to the theme since \"Russia was a contiguous empire in which Europeans, living side by side with 'orientals', identified (and intermarried) with them far more than in the case of other colonial powers\".\n\nNonetheless, Taruskin characterizes Orientalism in Romantic Russian music as having melodies \"full of close little ornaments and melismas\", chromatic accompanying lines, drone bass—characteristics which were used by Glinka, Balakirev, Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakov, Lyapunov, and Rachmaninov. These musical characteristics evoke \"not just the East, but the seductive East that emasculates, enslaves, renders passive. In a word, it signifies the promise of the experience of \"nega\", a prime attribute of the orient as imagined by the Russians. ... In opera and song, \"nega\" often simply denotes S-E-X a la russe, desired or achieved.\"\n\nOrientalism is also traceable in music that is considered to have effects of exoticism, including the \"japonisme\" in Claude Debussy's piano music all the way to the sitar being used in recordings by the Beatles.\n\nThe Romantic movement in literature began in 1785 and ended around 1830. The term \"Romantic\" references the ideas and culture that writers of the time reflected in their work. During this time, the culture and objects of the East began to have a profound effect on Europe. Extensive traveling by artists and members of the European elite brought travelogues and sensational tales back to the West creating a great interest in all things \"foreign\". Romantic Orientalism incorporates African and Asian geographic locations, well-known colonial and \"native\" personalities, folklore, and philosophies to create a literary environment of colonial exploration from a distinctly European worldview. The current trend in analysis of this movement references a belief in this literature as a mode to justify European colonial endeavors with the expansion of territory.\n\nIn his novel \"Salammbô\", Gustave Flaubert used ancient Carthage in North Africa as a foil to ancient Rome. He portrayed its culture as morally corrupting and suffused with dangerously alluring eroticism. This novel proved hugely influential on later portrayals of ancient Semitic cultures.\n\nSaid argues that the continuity of Orientalism into the present can be found in influential images, particularly through the Cinema of the United States, as the West has now grown to include the United States. Many blockbuster feature film, such as the \"Indiana Jones\" series, \"The Mummy\" films, and Disney's \"Aladdin\" film series demonstrate the imagined geographies of the East. The films usually portray the lead heroic characters as being from the Western world, while the villains often come from the East. The representation of the Orient has continued in film, although this representation does not necessarily have any truth to it.\n\nThe overly sexualized character of Princess Jasmine in \"Aladdin\" is simply a continuation of the paintings from the 19th century, where women were represented as erotic, sexualized male fantasies.\n\nIn \"The Tea House of the August Moon\" (1956), as argued by Pedro Iacobelli, there are tropes of orientalism. He notes, that the film \"tells us more about the Americans and the American's image of Okinawa rather than about the Okinawan people\".The film characterizes the Okinawans as \"merry but backward\" and \"de-politicized\", which ignored the real-life Okinawan political protests over forceful land acquisition by the American military at the time.\n\nKimiko Akita, in \"Orientalism and the Binary of Fact and Fiction in Memoirs of a Geisha\", argues that \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" (2005) contains orientalist tropes and deep \"cultural misrepresentations\". She states that \"Memoirs of a Geish]\" \"reinforces the idea of Japanese culture and geisha as exotic, backward, irrational, dirty, profane, promiscuous, bizarre, and enigmatic\".\n\nDuring the Romantic Period of the 19th century, ballet developed a preoccupation with the exotic. This exoticism ranged from ballets set in Scotland to those based on ethereal creatures. By the later part of the century, ballets were capturing the presumed essence of the mysterious East. These ballets often included sexual themes and tended to be based on assumptions of people rather than on concrete facts. Orientalism is apparent in numerous ballets.\n\nThe Orient motivated several major ballets, which have survived since the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. \"Le Corsaire\" premiered in 1856 at the Paris Opera, with choreography by Joseph Mazilier. Marius Petipa re-choreographed the ballet for the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899. Its complex storyline, loosely based on Lord Byron's poem, takes place in Turkey and focuses on a love story between a pirate and a beautiful slave girl. Scenes include a bazaar where women are sold to men as slaves, and the Pasha's Palace, which features his harem of wives. In 1877, Marius Petipa choreographed \"La Bayadere\", the love story of an Indian temple dancer and Indian warrior. This ballet was based on Kalidasa's play \"Sakuntala\". \"La Bayadere\" used vaguely Indian costuming, and incorporated Indian inspired hand gestures into classical ballet. In addition, it included a 'Hindu Dance,' motivated by Kathak, an Indian dance form. Another ballet, \"Sheherazade\", choreographed by Michel Fokine in 1910 to music by Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakov, is a story involving a shah's wife and her illicit relations with a Golden Slave, originally played by Vaslav Nijinsky. The ballet's controversial fixation on sex includes an orgy in an oriental harem. When the shah discovers the actions of his numerous wives and their lovers, he orders the deaths of those involved. \"Sheherazade\" was loosely based on folktales of questionable authenticity.\n\nSeveral lesser-known ballets of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also reveal Orientalism. For instance, in Petipa's \"Pharaoh's Daughter\" (1862), an Englishman imagines himself, in an opium-induced dream, as an Egyptian boy who wins the love of the Pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia. Aspicia's costume consisted of 'Egyptian' décor on a tutu. Another ballet, Hippolyte Monplaisir's \"Brahma\", which premiered in 1868 in La Scala, Italy, is a story that involves romantic relations between a slave girl and Brahma, the Hindu god, when he visits earth. In addition, in 1909, Serge Diagilev included \"Cleopatra\" in Ballet's Russe's repertory. With its theme of sex, this revision of Fokine's \"Une Nuit d' Egypte\" combined the \"exoticism and grandeur\" that audiences of this time craved.\n\nAs one of the pioneers of modern dance in America, Ruth St Denis also explored Orientalism in her dancing. Her dances were not authentic; she drew inspiration from photographs, books, and later from museums in Europe. Yet, the exoticism of her dances catered to the interests of society women in America. She included \"Radha\" and \"The Cobras\" in her 'Indian' program in 1906. In addition, she found success in Europe with another Indian-themed ballet, \"The Nautch\" in 1908. In 1909, upon her return to America, St Denis created her first 'Egyptian' work, \"Egypta\". Her preference for Orientalism continued, culminating with \"Ishtar of the Seven Gates\" in 1923, about a Babylonian goddess.\n\nWhile Orientalism in dance climaxed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is still present in modern times. For instance, major ballet companies regularly perform \"Le Corsaire\", \"La Bayadere\", and \"Sheherazade\". Furthermore, Orientalism is also found within newer versions of ballets. In versions of \"The Nutcracker\", such as the 2010 American Ballet Theatre production, the Chinese dance uses an arm position with the arms bent at a ninety-degree angle and the index fingers pointed upwards, while the Arabian dance uses two dimensional bent arm movements. Inspired by ballets of the past, stereotypical 'Oriental' movements and arm positions have developed and remain.\n\nAn exchange of Western and Eastern ideas about spirituality developed as the West traded with and established colonies in Asia. The first Western translation of a Sanskrit text appeared in 1785, marking the growing interest in Indian culture and languages. Translations of the \"Upanishads\", which Arthur Schopenhauer called \"the consolation of my life\", first appeared in 1801 and 1802. Early translations also appeared in other European languages. 19th-century transcendentalism was influenced by Asian spirituality, prompting Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) to pioneer the idea of spirituality as a distinct field.\n\nA major force in the mutual influence of Eastern and Western spirituality and religiosity was the Theosophical Society, a group searching for ancient wisdom from the East and spreading Eastern religious ideas in the West. One of its salient features was the belief in \"Masters of Wisdom\", \"beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others\". The Theosophical Society also spread Western ideas in the East, contributing to its modernisation and a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.\n\nThe Theosophical Society had a major influence on Buddhist modernism and Hindu reform movements. Between 1878 and 1882, the Society and the Arya Samaj were united as the Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj. Helena Blavatsky, along with H. S. Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala, was instrumental in the Western transmission and revival of Theravada Buddhism.\n\nAnother major influence was Vivekananda, who popularised his modernised interpretation of Advaita Vedanta during the later 19th and early 20th century in both India and the West, emphasising \"anubhava\" (\"personal experience\") over scriptural authority.\n\nThe term \"re-orientalism\" was used by Lisa Lau and Ana Cristina Mendes to refer to how Eastern self-representation is based on western referential points:\n\n\"Re-Orientalism differs from Orientalism in its manner of and reasons for referencing the West: while challenging the metanarratives of Orientalism, re-Orientalism sets up alternative metanarratives of its own in order to articulate eastern identities, simultaneously deconstructing and reinforcing Orientalism.\"\n\nThe term \"Occidentalism\" is often used to refer to negative views of the Western world found in Eastern societies and is founded on the sense of nationalism that spread in reaction to colonialism.\n\nThe action of \"othering\" cultures occurs when groups are labeled as different due to characteristics that distinguish them from the perceived norm. Edward Said, the author of the book \"Orientalism\", argued that western powers and influential individuals such as social scientists and artists othered \"the Orient\". The evolution of ideologies is often initially embedded in the language, and continues to ripple through the fabric of society by taking over the culture, economy and political sphere.\n\nMuch of Said's criticism of Western Orientalism is based on what he describes as articularizing trends. These ideologies are present in Asian works by Indian, Chinese, and Japanese writers and artists, in their views of Western culture and tradition.\n\nA particularly significant development is the manner in which Orientalism has taken shape in non-Western cinema, as for instance in Hindi cinema.\n\nSaid has been accused of Occidentalizing the west in his critique Orientalism, \"i.e.\" of being guilty of falsely characterizing the West in the same way that he accuses Western scholars of falsely characterizing the East. Said essentialized the west by creating a homogeneous image of the area. Currently, the west consists not only of Europe, but also the United States, which has become more influential and dominant over the years.\n\n\n\n"}

It can have several shapes, such as triangular, tapering or a burgee.\n\nIt was one of the principal three varieties of flags carried during the Middle Ages (the other two were the banner and the standard). Pennoncells and streamers or pendants are minor varieties of this style of flag. The pennon is a flag resembling the guidon in shape, but only half the size. It does not contain any coat of arms, but only crests, mottos and heraldic and ornamental devices.\n\nPennon comes from the Latin \"penna\" meaning \"a wing\" or \"a feather\".\n\nThe pennon was sometimes pointed, but more generally forked or swallow-tailed at the end. In the 11th century, the pennon was generally square, the fly end being decorated with the addition of pointed tongues or streamers, somewhat similar to the oriflamme. During the reign of Henry III, the pennon acquired the distinctive swallow-tail, or the single-pointed shape. Another version of the single-pointed pennon was introduced in the 13th century. In shape this was a scalene triangle, obtained by cutting diagonally the vertically oblong banner.\n\nThe pennon was a purely personal ensign. It was essentially the flag of the knight bachelor, as apart from the knight banneret, carried by him on his lance, displaying his personal armorial bearings, and set out so that they stood in correct position when he couched his lance for charging. A manuscript of the 16th century (Harl. 2358, \"A paper Heraldical book in small Quarto\") in the British Museum, which gives detailed particulars as to the size, shape and bearings of the standards, banners, pennons and pennoncells, says \"a pennon must be two yards and a half long, made round at the end, and contain the arms of the owner,\" and warns that \"from a standard or streamer a man may flee but not from his banner or pennon bearing his arms.\" A pennoncell (or penselle) was a diminutive pennon carried by the esquires.\n\nPennons were also used for any special ceremonial occasion, and more particularly at state funerals. For instance, there were \"XII doz. penselles\" among the items that figured at the funeral of the Duke of Norfolk in 1554, and in the description of the lord mayor's procession in 1555, it reads \"two goodly pennes (state barges) decked with flags and streamers, and a 1000 penselles.\" Among the items that ran the total cost of the funeral of Oliver Cromwell up to an enormous sum of money, there is the mention of 30 dozen of pennoncells a foot long and costing 20 shillings a dozen, and 20 dozen of the same kind of flags at 12 shillings a dozen.\n\nThe streamer, so called in Tudor days but now better known as the pennant or pendant, was a long, tapering flag, which it was directed \"shall stand in the top of a ship or in the forecastle, and therein be put no arms, but the man's cognisance or device, and may be of length 20, 30, 40 or , and is slit as well as a guidon or standard\". Among the fittings of the ship that took Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, to France in the reign of Henry VII was a \"great streamer for the ship in length [and] in breadth\".\n\nBesides the white ensign, ships commissioned in the Royal Navy fly a long streamer from the maintopgallant masthead. This, which is called a pennant, is in fact the sign of command, and it is first hoisted when a captain commissions his ship. The pennant, which was really the old \"pennoncell\", was of three colours for the whole of its length, and towards the end left separate in two or three tails, and so continued until the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Now, however the pennant is a long white streamer with the St George's cross in the inner portion close to the mast. Pennants have been carried by men-of-war from the earliest times, prior to 1653 at the yard-arm, but since that date at the maintopgallant masthead. There are other navies that also fly pennant in a similar manner (see pennant (commissioning)).\n\nThe commissioning pennant in ships may end in a point, but they can also be forked, in which case it is also called a banderole.\n\nPennants are also associated with American sports teams, such as Major League Baseball and college sports teams. In Australian rules football, a pennant is awarded to the winner of major competitions. For many years, this was the only prize given. As a result, a League Championship is often referred to as a \"pennant\", as in, \"The Giants win the Pennant!\" And in Australian football, a premiership can also be referred to as a \"flag\".\n\nIn the Netherlands, an orange pennon is always used on the King's Day. It is flown alongside the standard Dutch flag. The Dutch provinces each have a pennon as well.\n\n\n\n"}

Schuyler, a prominent black essayist and journalist Josephine Cogdell, a white Texan and one-time Mack Sennett bathing beauty, from a former slave-owning family. Her parents believed that intermarriage could \"invigorate\" both races and produce extraordinary offspring. They also advocated that mixed-race marriage could help to solve many of the United States's social problems.\n\nCogdell further believed that genius could best be developed by a diet consisting exclusively of raw foods. As a result, Philippa grew up in her New York City apartment eating a diet predominantly comprising raw carrots, peas and yams and raw steak. She was given a daily ration of cod liver oil and lemon slices in place of sweets. \"When we travel,\" Cogdell said, \"Philippa and I amaze waiters. You have to argue with most waiters before they will bring you raw meat. I guess it is rather unusual to see a little girl eating a raw steak.\"\n\nRecognized as a prodigy at an early age, Schuyler was reportedly able to read and write at the age of two and a half, and composed music from the age of five. At nine, she became the subject of \"Evening With A Gifted Child\", a profile written by Joseph Mitchell, correspondent for \"The New Yorker\", who heard several of her early compositions and noted that she addressed both her parents by their first names.\n\nSchuyler began giving piano recitals and radio broadcasts while still a child and attracted significant press coverage. New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia was one of her admirers and visited her at her home on more than one occasion. By the time she reached adolescence, Schuyler was touring constantly, both in the US and overseas.\n\nHer talent as a pianist was widely acknowledged, although many critics believed that her forte lay in playing vigorous pieces and criticized her style when tackling more nuanced works. Acclaim for her performances led to her becoming a role model for many children in the United States of the 1930s and 1940s, but Schuyler's own childhood was blighted when, during her teenage years, her parents showed her the scrapbooks they had compiled recording her life and career. The books contained numerous newspaper clippings in which both George and Josephine Schuyler commented on their beliefs and ambitions for their daughter. Realisation that she had been conceived and raised, in a sense, as an experiment, robbed the pianist of many of the illusions that had made her earlier youth a happy one.\n\nIn later life, Schuyler grew disillusioned with the racial and gender prejudice she encountered, particularly when performing in the United States, and much of her musical career was spent playing overseas. In her thirties she abandoned the piano to follow her father into journalism.\n\nSchuyler's personal life was frequently unhappy. She rejected many of her parents' values, increasingly becoming a vocal feminist, and made many attempts to pass herself off as a woman of Iberian (Spanish) descent named Filipa Monterro. Although she engaged in a number of affairs, and on one occasion endured a dangerous late-term abortion after a relationship with a Ghanaian diplomat, she never married.\n\nPhilippa Schuyler and her father, George Schuyler, were members of the John Birch Society.\n\nIn 1967 Schuyler traveled to Vietnam as a war correspondent. During a helicopter mission near Da Nang to evacuate a number of Vietnamese orphans, the helicopter crashed into the sea. While she initially survived the crash, her inability to swim caused her to drown. A court of enquiry found that the pilot had deliberately cut his motor and descended in an uncontrolled glide – possibly in an attempt to give his civilian passengers an insight into the dangers of flying in a combat zone – eventually losing control of the aircraft.\n\nHer mother was profoundly affected by her daughter's death and committed suicide a few days before its second anniversary.\n\nFilm rights to Schuyler's biography have been sold and it was once reported that she was to become the subject of a movie starring Alicia Keys.\n\nPhilippa Schuyler Middle School for the Gifted and Talented in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York is dedicated to preserving the memory of the child prodigy by offering an arts-focused education to New York City children.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His early studies were concerned with local history. His \"Histoire de Rouen sous la domination anglaise au XV siècle\" (1840) and \"Histoire de Rouen pendant l'époque communale, 1550–1382\" (Rouen, 1843–1844), are major productions for a time when the archives were neither catalogued nor classified, and contain useful documents previously unpublished. His theses for the degree of doctor, \"De l'administration de Louis XIV d'après les Mémoires inédits d'Olivier d'Ormesson\" and \"De Maria Stuarta et Henrico III\" (1849), led him to the study of general history. The former was expanded afterwards under the title \"Histoire de l'administration monarchique en France depuis l'avènement de Philippe-Auguste jusqu'à la mort de Louis XIV\" (1855), and in 1855 he also published his \"Dictionnaire historique des institutions, mœurs et coutumes de la France\", of which many editions have appeared.\n\nThese works may still be consulted for the 17th century, the period upon which Chéruel concentrated all his scientific activity. He edited successively the \"Journal d'Olivier Lefèvre d'Ormesson\" (1860–1862), interesting for the history of the \"parlement\" of Paris during the minority of King Louis XIV; \"Lettres du cardinal Mazarin pendant son ministère\" (6 vols, 1870–1891), continued by the vicomte Georges d'Avenel; and \"Mémoires du duc de Saint-Simon\", published for the first time according to the original manuscripts (2 editions, 1856–1858 and 1878–1881).\n\nTo Saint-Simon he devoted two critical studies, which are acute but not definitive: \"Saint-Simon considéré comme historien de Louis XIV\" (1865) and \"Notice sur la vie et sur les mémoires du duc de Saint-Simon\" (1876). The latter may be considered as an introduction to the famous \"Mémoires\". Among his later writings were the \"Histoire de la France pendant la minorité de Louis XIV\" (4 volumes, 1880) and \"Histoire de la France sous le ministère de Mazarin\" (1882–1883). These two works are valuable for abundance of facts, precision of details, and clear and intelligent arrangement, but are characterized by a slightly frigid style. In their compilation Chéruel used a fair number of unpublished documents. To the student of the second half of the 17th century in France, the works of Chéruel are a mine of information.\n"}
{"id": "3451324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3451324", "title": "Postmodern picture book", "text": "Postmodern picture book\n\nPostmodern picture books are a specific genre of picture books. Characteristics of this unique type of book include non-linear narrative forms in storybooks, books that are \"aware\" of themselves as books and include self-referential elements, and what is known as metafiction.\n\nA classic example of this genre is David Macaulay's award winning \"Black and White\" (1990). This book consists of four \"separate\" sub-plots which are related, but the reader must decide in what way the story becomes meaningful. The inside front cover of this book, awarded the Caldecott Medal in 1990, states: \"WARNING: This book appears to contain a number of stories that do not necessarily occur at the same time. But it may contain only one story. Then again, there may be four stories. Or four parts of a story. Careful inspection of both words and pictures is recommended.\"\n\nExamples of postmodern picture books include David Wiesner's \"The Three Pigs\", Anthony Browne's \"Voices in the Park\", and Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith's \"The Stinky Cheese Man\". Some books have unusual pictures that don't always mesh with the traditional, linear text (that often matches the pictures). An example would be \"Bamboozled\" by David Legge.\n\nFrank Serafini (2004) has created lesson plans that lead students to discuss how text interacts with illustrations. Three sets of texts could be discussed: books that have corresponding text and pictures, books where the illustrations enhance the texts, and books where the illustrations contradict the text (\"Bamboozled\" is an example of contradictory text). Another lesson that Serafini describes that incorporates PM picture books could be having students read books that are ambiguous and allow for multiple interpretations. Student are encouraged to record their thinking in a journal called a \"walking notebook\". Books that are especially open to interpretation include: Browne's \"Voices in the Park\", Wiesner's \"The Three Pigs\", and David Macauley's \"Black and White\".\n\nThese books could be thought of as multi-modal texts that defy the usual, linear organization of storybooks. In postmodern, meta-fictive books, the reader is intentionally made aware of the way that the book calls attention to itself. For example, in Wiesner's \"The Three Pigs\", the main characters decide to climb outside the text; pictures depicting the pigs climbing outside the story are prominent. In \"The Stinky Cheese Man\", Scieszka and Lane purposely use intertextual references, or references to many other well-known fables, to create tongue-in-cheek, satirical stories and spin-offs of classic fairy tales. Widely varying size fonts and pictures combine to create a post-modern picture book.\n\nAccording to Anstey (2002), characteristics of postmodern picture books include:\n\n\nRyan & Anstey (2003) suggest that post-modern picture books may allow students to increase their \"self-knowledge about reading\" and that students might be able to use this knowledge in strategic ways as they read. In their study, Ryan and Anstey looked at how sixth graders responded to a PM picture book, which was selected because it was open to many interpretations, titled \"The Rabbits\" by John Marsden and Shaun Tan. They discovered that the reading of such texts allow students to draw upon their resources as readers. The reading of such books supports a multiliteracies perspective. Accordingly, such books may be useful in allowing teachers to use texts that encourage students to draw upon their own identity and use this knowledge to read strategically.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55968776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55968776", "title": "Reciprocal causation", "text": "Reciprocal causation\n\nIn biology, reciprocal causation arises when developing organisms are both \"products\" of evolution as well as \"causes\" of evolution. Formally, reciprocal causation exists when process A is a cause of process B and, subsequently, process B is a cause of process A, with this feedback potentially repeated. Some researchers, particularly advocates of the extended evolutionary synthesis, promote the view that causation in biological systems is inherently reciprocal.\n\nHarvard evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr (1961) suggested that there are two fundamentally different types of causation in biology, ‘ultimate’ and ‘proximate’. Ultimate causes (e.g. natural selection) were seen as (i) providing historical accounts for the existence of an organism’s features, and (ii) explaining the function or ‘goal-directedness’ of living beings. In contrast, proximate causes (e.g. physiology) were seen as explaining how biological systems work. According to Mayr, the evolutionary sciences study ultimate causes and the rest of biology studies proximate causes. In some of his works, Mayr considered these domains autonomous:\n“The clarification of the biochemical mechanism by which the genetic program is translated into the phenotype tells us absolutely nothing about the steps by which natural selection has built up the particular genetic program.”\nMayr, 1980\nThere has been widespread acceptance of the proximate-ultimate dichotomy within the evolutionary sciences. However, many biologists, psychologists and philosophers have taken issue with Mayr’s corollary that the proximate-ultimate distinction implies that development is irrelevant to evolution. For instance, evolutionary biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard writes:\n“The proximate-ultimate distinction has given rise to a new confusion, namely, a belief that proximate causes of phenotypic variation have nothing to do with ultimate, evolutionary explanation.”\nWest-Eberhard, 2003\nMayr’s position implied a unidirectional or linear conception of causation for both development and evolution: genotypes cause phenotypes (proximate causation), whilst through natural selection, changes in environments cause changes in organisms (ultimate causation). Reciprocal causation was proposed as an alternative to this linear characterization. (see also ) It emphasizes how causation cycles through biological systems recursively, allowing proximate causes to feed back and thereby feature in ultimate explanations. \n\nReciprocal causation features in several explanations within contemporary evolutionary biology, including sexual selection theory, coevolution, habitat selection, and frequency-dependent selection. In these examples, the source of selection on a trait coevolves with the trait itself, therefore causation is reciprocal and developmental processes potentially become relevant to evolutionary accounts. For instance, a peacock’s tail evolves through mating preferences in peahens, and those preferences coevolve with the male trait. The ‘ultimate explanation’ for the male trait is the prior existence of female preferences, proximately manifest in differential peahen mate choice decisions, whilst the ‘ultimate explanation’ for the peahens’ mating preferences is the prior existence of variation in the peacock’s tail associated with fitness. This example illustrates how reciprocal causation is not a rejection of the proximate-ultimate distinction itself, but instead a rejection of the implication that developmental processes should not feature in evolutionary explanations.\n\nReciprocal causation also applies in other domains of evolutionary biology. The extended evolutionary synthesis emphasizes how developmental events, including both the causal effects of environments on organisms (for instance, arising through developmental plasticity, or epigenetic inheritance) and the causal effects of organisms on environments (e.g. niche construction), can direct the course of evolution. Developmental plasticity, niche construction, extra-genetic forms of inheritance and developmental bias are recognized as playing evolutionary roles that cannot be reduced to natural selection of genetically encoded characters or strategies. Proximate causes are not autonomous from natural selection, but rather feed back to influence the rate and direction of adaptive evolution. This goes beyond the recognition that ontogenetic processes can impose constraints on the action of selection, or that proximate and ultimate processes interact. Rather, developmental processes are also seen as a source of evolutionary novelty, initiators of evolutionary episodes, and co-directors of patterns of evolutionary change.\n\nAcceptance or rejection of Mayr’s proximate-ultimate distinction may lie at the centre of several major debates within contemporary biology, concerning evo devo (evolutionary developmental biology), niche construction, cultural evolution, human cooperation, and the evolution of language. According to some biologists and philosophers, these disputes share a common pattern. On one side are researchers who consider that interaction and feedback processes traditionally characterized as ‘proximate’ have explanatory value for ‘ultimate’ evolutionary questions. Their concern is that the proximate-ultimate distinction has discouraged consideration of the manner in which developmental processes can set the evolutionary agenda, for instance, by introducing innovations, channeling phenotypic variation, or initiating evolutionary episodes through modifying selection pressures. One the other side are researchers who largely adopt Mayr’s stance with a clean separation of proximate and ultimate causation. For the latter, a failure to respect Mayr’s dichotomy is considered a sign of confusing an evolutionary explanation with a mechanistic explanation.\n"}

The monarchs of the time practiced religious tolerance and openly encouraged religious discussions and invited teachers of every sect to the public halls to preach their doctrines.\n\nTamil religions denotes the religious traditions and practices of Tamil-speaking people. The Tamils are native to modern state of India known as Tamil Nadu and the northern and eastern part of Sri Lanka. Tamils lives also outside their native boundaries due to migration such as Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, South Africa, Australia, Great Britain, United States, Canada, Réunion, Myanmar, Mauritius and in countries in Europe. Many emigrant Tamils retain elements of a cultural, linguistic, and religious tradition that predates the Christian era.\n\nA Neolithic cattle-herding culture existed in South India several millennia prior to the Christian era. By the first century, a relatively well-developed civilization had emerged. It is described in some detail in Tamil texts such as the Tholkappiyam (third BCE) and by the Sankam poets—an \"academy\" of poets who wrote in the first two centuries of the Common Era.\n\nAncient Tamil grammatical works Tholkappiyam, the ten anthologies Pathuppāṭṭu, the eight anthologies Eṭṭuttokai sheds light on early religion of ancient Tamil people. Murugan was glorified as, \"the red god seated on the blue peacock, who is ever young and resplendent,\" as \"the favored god of the Tamils.\" Shiva was also seen as the supreme God. Early iconography of Murugan and Shiva and their association with native flora and fauna goes back to Indus Valley Civilization. The Sangam landscape was classified into five categories, \"thinais\", based on the mood, the season and the land. Tolkappiyam, mentions that each of these \"thinai\" had an associated deity such Murugan in \"Kurinji\"-the hills, Thirumal in \"Mullai\"-the forests, Kaali in \"Pālai\"-the deserts, Indra in \"Marutham\"-the plains and Varuna in \"Neithal\"-the coasts and the seas. Other gods mentioned were Krishna and Balaram who were all assimilated into Sangam religion over time. Dravidian influence on early Vedic religion is evident, many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo-Aryan language, the language of the \"Rigveda\" (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed to Dravidian languages. This represents an early religious and cultural fusion or synthesis between ancient Tamils and Indo-Aryans, which became more evident over time with sacred iconography, flora and fauna that went on to influence Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nThe cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one. The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly a goddess. In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai.\n\n\"Veriyattam\" refers to spirit possession of women, who took part in priestly functions. Under the influence of the god, women sang and danced, but also read the dim past, predicted the future, diagnosed diseases. Twenty two poets of the Sangam age in as many as 40 poems portray Veriyatal. Velan is a reporter and prophet endowed with supernatural powers. Veriyatal had been performed by men as well as women.\n\nAmong the early Tamils the practice of erecting hero stones (\"nadukkal\") had appeared, and it continued for quite a long time after the Sangam age, down to about 11th century. It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.\n\nTheyyam is a ritual shaman dance popular in Kerala and parts of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Theyyam migrates into the artist who has assumed the spirit and it is a belief that the god or goddess comes in the midst of fathering through the medium of possessed dancer. The dancer throws rice on the audience and distributes turmeric powder as symbols of blessing. Theyyam incorporates dance, mime and music and enshrines the rudiments of ancient tribal cultures which attached great importance to the worship of heroes and the spirits of ancestors, is a socio-religious ceremony. There are over 400 Theyyams performed, the most spectacular ones are those of Raktha Chamundi, Kari Chamundi, Muchilottu Bhagavathi, Wayanadu Kulaven, Gulikan and Pottan. These are performed in front of shrines, sans stage or curtains.\n\nThe early character of Tamil religion was celebrative. It embodied an aura of sacral immanence, sensing the sacred in the vegetation, fertility, and color of the land. The summum bonum of the religious experience was expressed in terms of possession by the god, or ecstasy. Into this milieu there immigrated a sobering influence—a growing number of Jain and Buddhist communities and an increasing influx of northerners.\n\nThe layout of villages can be assumed to be standard across most villages. An Amman (mother goddess) is at the centre of the villages while a male guardian deity () has a shrine at the village borders. Nowadays, Amman can be either worshipped alone or as a part of the Vedic pantheon.\n\nThroughout Tamil Nadu, a king was considered to be divine by nature and possessed religious significance. The King was 'the representative of God on earth' and lived in a \"koyil\", which means the \"residence of God\". The Modern Tamil word for temple is koil (). Titular worship was also given to Kings.\n\nWords meaning 'King', like \"kō\" ( \"King\"), \"iṟai\" ( \"Emperor\") and \"āṇḍavan\" ( \"Conqueror\") now primarily refer to Gods. Mōcikīraṉār in the Purananuru says: \nThe Kingdom suffered by famine or disorder when the King erred. These elements were incorporated later into Hinduism like the legendary marriage of Shiva to Queen Meenatchi who ruled Madurai or Wanji-ko, a god who later merged into Indra. Tolkappiyar refers to the Three Crowned Kings as the \"Three Glorified by Heaven\", (). In the Dravidian-speaking South, the concept of divine kingship led to the assumption of major roles by state and temple.\n\nAt the birth of Raja Raja Chola I, the Thiruvalangadu inscription states, \"Having noticed by the marks (on his body) that Arulmozhi was the very Thirumal, the protector of the three worlds, descended on earth...\" During the Bhakti movement, poets often compared gods to kings.\n\nThe brick temple excavated in 2005 dates to the Sangam period and is believed to be the oldest Hindu temple to be found in Tamil Nadu. The temple faces north, unlike most Hindu temples which face either east or west and is believed to have been constructed even before \"shilpa shastras\" were written\nDuring the Sangam period, Shiva, Murugan, Thirumal and Kotravai were some of the popular deities. The poetic division of the landscape into five regions also associated each region with its own patron deity.\nThe people of the pastoral lands or the Mullai regions worshipped Thirumal. The Marutham people worshipped Indra or \"Ventan\", while the Neithal people considered Varunan or \"Katalon\" to be their patron deity and the Palai people worshipped Korravai or Kali. Other popular deities of this age were Kama the god of love, Surya the sun, Chandra the moon and Yama the god of death. The Brahmins of the Tamil country attached great importance to the performance of Vedic sacrifices. Priests learned in the Vedic rites typically performed them under the patronage of the kings.\n\nThe temples of the Sangam age were built out of perishable materials such as plaster, timber and brick, which is why little trace of them is found today. The only public structures of any historical importance belonging to this age that have survived to this day are the rock-beds hewn out of natural rock formation, that were made for the ascetics. The \"Silappatikaram\" and the Sangam poems such as \"Kaliththokai\", \"Mullaippāṭṭu\" and \"Purananuru\" mention several kinds of temples such as the \"Puranilaikkottam\" or the temple at the outskirts of a city, the \"Netunilaikkottam\" or the tall temple, the \"Palkunrakkottam\" the temple on top of a hill, the \"Ilavantikaippalli\" or the temple with a garden and bathing ghat, the \"Elunilaimatam\" or a seven storeyed temple, the \"Katavutkatinakar\" or the temple city.\n\nSome of the popular festivals of this age were Karthigaideepam, Tiruvonam, Kaman vizha and Indira vizha. Karthigaideepam was otherwise known as Peruvizha and was celebrated in the Tamil month of Karthigai every year. The Kaaman vizha was held in the spring and during this festival, men and women dressed up well and participated in dancing. Indravizha included the performance of Vedic sacrifices, prayers to various gods, musical recitals and dancing.\n\nThe exact origins of Jainism in Tamil Nadu is unclear. However, Jains flourished in Tamil Nadu at least as early as the Sangam period. Tamil Jain tradition places their origins are much earlier. Some scholars believe that the author of the oldest extant work of literature in Tamil (3rd century BCE), Tolkāppiyam, was a Jain.\n\nA number of Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have been found in Tamil Nadu that date from the 2nd century BCE. They are regarded to be associated with Jain monks and lay devotees.\n\nScholars consider the Tirukkural by Valluvar to be the work by a Jain. It emphatically supports vegetarianism (Chapter 26) and states that giving up animal sacrifice is worth more than a thousand offerings in fire (verse 259).\n\nSilappatikaram, a major work in Tamil literature, was written by a Camaṇa, Ilango Adigal. It describes the historical events of its time and also of the then-prevailing religions, Jainism, Buddhism and Shaivism. The main characters of this work, Kannagi and Kovalan, who have a divine status among Tamils, were Jains.\n\nAccording to George L. Hart, the legend of the Tamil Sangams or \"literary assemblies: was based on the Jain \"sangham\" at Madurai:\nThere was a permanent Jaina assembly called a Sangha established about 604 CE in Maturai. It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the cangkam legend.\"\n\nJainism began to decline around the 8th century, with many Tamil kings embracing Hindu religions, especially Shaivism. Still, the Chalukya, Pallava and Pandya dynasties embraced Jainism.\n\nThe Buddhists worshiped the impressions of Buddha’s feet engraved on stone and platforms made of stone that represented his seat. The pious Buddhist walked round them, with his right side towards them and bowed his head as a token of reverence. The Silapatikaram mentions that the monks worshipped Buddha by praising him as the wise, holy and virtuous teacher who adhered to his vows strictly, as the one who subdued anger and all evil passions and as the refuge of all mankind. Manimekalai is a sequel to the Silapathikaram, which tellst the story of Buddhism of the daughter of Kovalan and Madhavi.\n\nIn the Buddhist Viharas or monasteries, learned monks preached their sermons, seated in a place which was entirely concealed from the view of the audience. The Buddhists did not observe the distinctions of caste and invited all ranks to assemble on a footing of equality. Self-control, wisdom and charity were among the virtues preached and practiced by the monks, who were numerous in the ancient Tamil country.\n\nChristianity is said to be introduced in India by St. Thomas the Apostle who landed at Muziris on Malabar Coast in the year 52 AD. These ancient Christians are today known as Saint Thomas Christians or Syriac Christians or Nasrani. They are now divided into different denominations namely, Syro-Malabar Catholic, Syro-Malankara Catholic, Malankara Orthodox, Jacobite and Malankara Marthoma. Syriac Christians followed the same rules of caste and population as that of Hindus and sometimes they were even considered as population neutralizers. They tend to be endogamous, and tend not to intermarry even with other Christian groupings. Saint Thomas Christians derive status within the caste system from the tradition that they were elites, who were evangelized by St. Thomas. Also, internal mobility is allowed among these Saint Thomas Christian sects and the caste status is kept even if the sect allegiance is switched (for example, from Syriac Orthodox to Syro-Malabar Catholic). Despite the sectarian differences, Syriac Christians share a common social status within the Caste system of Kerala and is considered as Forward Caste.\n\nThe traditional account is that traders from Judea arrived in the city of Cochin, Kerala in 562 BCE, and that more Jews came as exiles from Israel in the year 70 CE after the destruction of the Second Temple. The distinct Jewish community was called Anjuvannam. The still-functioning synagogue in Mattancherry belongs to the Paradesi Jews, the descendants of Sephardim that were expelled from Spain in 1492.\n\nThe secular identity of the Sangam literature is often celebrated to represent the tolerance among Tamil people. Es Vaiyāpurip Piḷḷai, concludes in his \"History of Tamil language and literature: beginning to 1000 A. D.\": Most scholars agree that the lack of 'god' should not be inferred to be atheistic. The Tamil books of Law, particularly the Tirukkural, is considered as the Perennial philosophy of Tamil culture because of its universalisability.\n\nŪzh meaning 'fate' or 'destiny' and vinai meaning 'works' concerns the ancient Tamil belief of differentiating what man can do and what is destined.\n\nSangam Tamil people understood two distinct characteristics of Godhood. God who is beyond all () and the God who sets things in motion ().\n\n"}

The Sefire treaty inscriptions are the three inscriptions on the steles.\n\nTwo treaties conducted between minor kings from the Kingdom of Arpad inscribed on the stelae are often cited as evidence of the Aramaean tradition of treaty-making. The Sefire inscriptions are of interest to those studying beliefs and practices in ancient Syria and Palestine and the text is considered notable for constituting \"the best extrabiblical source for West Semitic traditions of covenantal blessings and curses.\"\n\nThey tell of \"The treaty of King Bar-ga'yah of K[a]t[a]k, with Mati'el son of Attarsamak, king of Arpad.\" Some have identified this as the treaty of \"Ashurnerari V\" (Adad-nirari III or his son Tiglath-pileser III?) of Assyria and Matiilu (unknown) of Arpad (probably modern Tel Rifaat, Syria).\n\nThis is a basalt slab broken in two horizontally. The first two steles each have three faces bearing writing.\n\nAs with Sefire I stele Sefire II had three faces bearing writing. While most of the text of Sefire II A and B permit coherent translation only with comparison with Sefire I and III, the concluding portion of Sefire II A and B is quite clear.\n\nNine fragments of the reverse of a broad slab.\n\nThe inscriptions record two treaties that \"list curses and magical rites which take effect if the treaty is violated.\"\n\nOne is a treaty between two minor kings, Barga'yah and Matti'el, who hailed from the southwestern periphery of the Assyrian empire. In the text, Matti'el swears to accept dire consequences for himself and his cities should he violate the stipulations of the treaty:\n\"...\nAs this wax is consumed by fire, thus Ma[tti'el] shall be consumed b[y fi]re.\nAs this bow and these arrows are broken, thus Inurta and Hadad (= names of local deities) shall break [the bow of Matti'el] and the bows of his nobles.\nAs a man of wax is blinded, thus Matti'el shall be blinded.\n[As] this calf is cut up, thus Matti'el and his nobles shall be cut up.\"\nThis loyalty oath from the Sefire inscriptions is similar to other loyalty oaths imposed by Assyrian kings on other less powerful monarchs in the Levant throughout the 8th and 7th centuries BCE.\n\nThe inscriptions may, under one possible interpretation, record the names of \"El and Elyon,\" \"God, God Most High\" possibly providing prima facie evidence for a distinction between the two deities first worshipped by the Jebusites in Jerusalem, and then elsewhere throughout the ancient Levant.\n\nThought to be reflective of Assyrian or neo-Assyrian culture and similar to other documents dating from the first millennium BCE, scholars such as Joseph Fitzmyer have perceived Canaanite influences in the text, while Dennis McCarthy has noted similarities to second millennium BCE treaties imposed by Hittite kings on Syrian vassals.\n\nFitzmyer, Joseph A., \"The Aramaic inscriptions of Sefîre\", Biblica et orientalia Sacra Scriptura antiquitatibus orientalibus illustrata, 19; Revised edition; Rome: Pontificial Biblical Institute, 1995.\n\nGreenfield, Jonas C., \"Three Notes on the Sefire Inscription,\" \"JSS\" 11 (1966), 98-105.\n"}
{"id": "3645463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3645463", "title": "Seoul City Sue", "text": "Seoul City Sue\n\nAnna Wallis Suh (1900–1969), the woman generally associated with the nickname \"Seoul City Sue,\" was a Methodist missionary, educator, and North Korean propaganda radio announcer to United States forces during the Korean War.\n\nSuh was born in Arkansas, the sixth of six children. After her mother and father died in 1910 and 1914, she relocated to Oklahoma to join a sister's family while she completed high school. She spent her early adult years as an office clerk and Sunday school teacher. Subsequently, she studied at the Southeastern State Teachers College, in Durant, and the Scarritt College for Christian Workers in Nashville, Tennessee, graduating in 1930 with a B.A. in ministry. She spent the next eight years working as a member of the American Southern Methodist Episcopal Mission in Korea. As Japanese colonial authorities continued to restrict the activities of foreign missions, Suh joined the staff of Shanghai American School (SAS) in 1938. There she met and married fellow staff member Sŏ Kyu Ch’ŏl (서규철 徐奎哲, also spelled Suh Kyoon Chul), thus losing her United States citizenship. Late in World War II she was interned by the Japanese for two years with other White Europeans at a camp in suburban Shanghai. After release, she resumed work at SAS for a year, before returning to Korea with her husband in 1946.\n\nThe Suhs settled in Seoul, where Suh taught at the U.S. Legation school until being fired in 1949 due to suspicion of her husband for left wing political activities. They remained or were trapped in Seoul during the Northern army's invasion of South Korea in June 1950. Suh began announcing a short English language program for North Korean \"Radio Seoul\" starting on or about July 18, continuing until shortly after the Inchon landing on September 15, when the Suhs were evacuated north as a part of the general withdrawal of North Korean forces. Subsequently, she continued broadcasts on Radio Pyongyang. The Suhs participated in the political indoctrination of US POWs at a camp near Pyongyang in February 1951.\n\nCharles Robert Jenkins reported that, some time after the war, Suh was put in charge of English language publications for the Korean Central News Agency. He also wrote that he saw her in a photo for a 1962 propaganda pamphlet, and met her briefly in 1965 at a department store in Pyongyang. Jenkins stated that he was told in 1972 that Suh had been shot as a South Korean double agent in 1969.\n\nSuh was born Anna Wallis to Albert B. and M. Jane Wallis in 1900 in Lawrence County, Arkansas. She was the youngest of six children.\n\nSuh's parents died when she was young; her mother died some time between the 1900 and 1910 Census, and her father in October 1914. Subsequently, she relocated to Oklahoma with a sister. Suh attended the Southeastern State Teachers College, in Durant, Oklahoma, before transferring to the Scarritt College for Christian Workers, an institution dedicated to the training of Methodist missionaries, in Nashville, Tennessee. Ann graduated with a B.A. in 1930.\n\nThat same year, she was selected for a mission to Korea by the Southern Methodist Conference. There, she initially taught at a Methodist school. By the early 1930s, the Japanese colonial administration had largely banned foreigners from Christian proselytizing, and most Christian missions focused on education, medicine, and care for the indigent. She may have returned to the US in 1935 to visit a sister. In late 1936, she was appointed to serve at the Seoul Social Evangelistic Center, and in February 1937, visited Scarritt College during a missionary furlough.\n\nIn a move that may have reflected increasingly harsh Japanese measures against foreign missionaries in the late 30s, Suh relocated to China to join the staff of the Shanghai American School (SAS) in 1938. There she met Sŏ Kyu Ch’ŏl, who was hired to teach Korean and assist in school administration. She was dropped from the rolls of the missionary service and lost her United States citizenship after they married. She developed an interest in Korean politics, eventually taking up her husband's leftist views. The cosmopolitan Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession were likely a more accepting environment for the Suhs than homogeneous 1940s Korea would later prove to be, as suggested by the number of other Caucasian women on staff married to Asian men. In 1939, she visited San Francisco in an unsuccessful attempt to secure a US passport for her husband.\n\nAmericans in Shanghai began to depart that same year, slowly as tensions rose in the environs of the city, then en masse shortly before the US and Japan officially went to war. SAS remained open until February 1943, when the remaining foreign staff were forced into the Chapei Civilian Relocation Center, a short distance away in the northern suburbs. This internment camp, one of several in and around Shanghai, occupied a three-story dormitory on the grounds of Great China University (now East China Normal University), most of which was damaged or destroyed during the 1937 Battle of Shanghai.\n\nWhether as a part of the remaining school staff or on her own, Suh also entered the Chapei center at this time, while her husband may have remained free as a colonial subject of Japan. During the internment, the SAS staff and parents took advantage of the school's books that had followed them to organize classes for the children. Supplies with which to maintain the internees grew short towards the end of the war, and a number of women married to citizens of Axis powers or neutral countries were released in late 1944. It is possible that Suh was among these. In March 1943, a missionary family, R.W. and M.F. Howes, along with their two girls, were interned in Chapei—the Japanese official name was Chapei Civil Assembly Center. Most of the people were Canadian or American, with some central European citizens. And later some British citizens were added from a camp further west up the Yangtze which the Japanese closed. \n\nSuh was released from Chapei camp along with other Americans and Canadians in September 1943 was not repatriated. The others left Shanghai in September 1943 on the Japanese ship Teia Maru, which traveled to Goa, India, and were exchanged for Japanese from America which had traveled on the Swedish ship \"The Griipsholm.\" \n\nIn December 1943, she was staying at Shanghai General Hospital, originally a Catholic hospital, but during the war under Japanese control though still staffed by Catholic sisters. \n\nWith Suh's formal release from detention at the end of World War II, she joined the staff of the reconstituted SAS for the 1945-46 school year.\n\nUnable to continue earning a sufficient living in post-war Shanghai, she and her husband returned to liberated Korea, where she tutored children at the US Diplomatic Mission School in Seoul. Her employment was terminated after her husband was investigated for left wing activities. Shortly thereafter, North Korea invaded the South in June 1950.\n\nThe Korean People's Army occupied Seoul three days after the start of hostilities. The speed of the advance caught the majority of residents by surprise and unprepared to evacuate, in part due to ROK radio propaganda rather at odds with the actual situation. Suh and her husband remained as well, perhaps because he was unwilling to abandon a school for indigent boys that he administered. During a July 10 meeting in Seoul that included 48 to 60 members of the ROK National Assembly, the couple pledged their loyalty to the North Korean regime.\n\nUnder Dr. Lee Soo, an English instructor from Seoul University, Suh began announcing for North Korean \"Radio Seoul\" from the Korean Broadcasting System's HLKA studios, with daily programs from 09:30 to 22:15 local time, first heard as early as July 18. The Suhs had been relocated to a temporary home near the station. Suh's defenders gave the dull tone of her broadcasts as proof that she was being forced to make them.\n\nHer initial scripts suggested that American soldiers return to their corner ice cream stands, criticized the USAF bombing campaign, and reported names recovered from the dog tags of dead American soldiers to a background of soft music. The GIs gave her various nicknames, including \"Rice Ball-\" or \"Rice Bowl Maggie\", \"Rice Ball Kate\", and \"Seoul City Sue\". The latter name stuck, likely derived from \"Sioux City Sue\", the title of a song initially made popular by Zeke Manners from 1946. Through the rest of the summer of 1950, her reports would announce the names of recently captured US airmen, marines, and soldiers, threaten new units arriving in country, welcome warships by name as they arrived on station, or taunt African-American soldiers regarding their limited civil rights at home. Her monotone on-air delivery and the lack of popular music programming evidently left Ann's broadcasts less enjoyable for her intended audience than German and Japanese English-language radio shows during World War II.\n\nRadio Seoul went off the air at the start of a \"Sue\" program during an August 13 air strike on communications and transportation facilities in the city, as a B-26 bomber dropped 200 lbs fragmentation bombs adjacent to the transmitter. The station came back on the air a week or two later. The Suhs were evacuated north by truck after the Inchon landings, a few days before US forces entered the city. Mr. & Mrs. Suh joined the staff of Radio Pyongyang, where she continued English-language broadcasts to UN forces. They were temporarily reassigned to indoctrinate UN POWs at Camp 12 near Pyongyang in February 1951, after which the POWs were directed to continue indoctrinating each other, with Korean supervision.\n\nFellow defector Charles Robert Jenkins made several claims about Suh in his book \"The Reluctant Communist\" that have not been independently verified. He reported that, some time after the war, she was put in charge of English language publications for the Korean Central News Agency. He wrote that he saw her in a photo for a 1962 propaganda pamphlet called \"I Am A Lucky Boy\", dining with Larry Allen Abshier, a US Army deserter and defector. Jenkins reported meeting her briefly in 1965 at the \"foreigners only\" section of the No. 2 Department Store in Pyongyang. Jenkins also stated that he was told in 1972 that Suh had been shot as a South Korean double agent in 1969.\n\nBased on US law through the 1930s, citizenship for a married woman was almost exclusively based on that of her husband, particularly if they lived in his native land. Therefore, Suh probably lost her US citizenship when she married Suh Kyoon Chul in China. Suh Kyoon Chul, as well as all other native residents of Korea and Taiwan, were nationals of the Empire of Japan, which recognized itself as a multi-ethnic state. Suh may not have recognized her situation until the 1939 visit to San Francisco to secure a US passport for her husband. In addition to her status as a Japanese national, the US had almost completely frozen Asian immigration with the Immigration Act of 1924, which would likely have precluded his obtaining a passport.\n\nArbitrary application of Japanese and US law may have dogged Suh over the following years. When the Japanese interned most ethnic Europeans within the Empire during World War II, it is not clear whether she was forced into the Chapei Relocation Center, or entered it willingly, since she was not a foreign national. Later, during the US military occupation of southern Korea, an attempt was made to restore her US citizenship, an effort which fell through for unknown reasons. It is possible that she became a national of South Korea as the wife of Mr. Suh. The Korean nationality that became reestablished between the end of World War II and the formal independence of the ROK in 1948 didn't distinguish between spouses. Although US forces sought her out after retaking Seoul in September, 1950, officials recognized that it was unlikely that Mrs. Suh could be charged with treason by the US.\n\nDuring the Korean War, USAF pilots improvised a spoof of the Zeke Manner's hit \"Sioux City Sue\" using the most popular nickname for Mrs. Suh.\n\nIn several episodes of the TV series \"M*A*S*H\" a North Korean announcer calling herself \"Seoul City Sue\" is heard on the radio (rebroadcast over the camp's PA). In \"Bombed\" she tells the GIs that their wives and girlfriends are being unfaithful and they would have more prosperous careers as civilians. In \"38 Across\" she accuses Hawkeye Pierce of war crimes for performing an experimental technique to successfully save the life of a North Korean POW.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

It involved a discussion concerning relations between Rome (that is, the papal see) and the Holy Roman Empire, which also had an important bearing on the Austria–Prussia rivalry—whether Austria was to be part of a federal Germany, or whether Germany would continue without Austria (as a Lesser Germany).\n\nHeinrich von Sybel fired the first shot in the dispute in an 1859 lecture, in which he condemned the medieval politics of the German Empire as \"unnational\". Julius Ficker countered in 1861 in lectures at the University of Innsbruck, in which he justified the emperors' national politics, which he also presented as universal. While Sybel's was a \"kleindeutsch-norddeutsch-protestantische\" (Little German-North German-Protestant) concept of history, Ficker promoted a Greater Germany which would include Austria.\n\nThe controversy's roots are in the Austria–Prussia rivalry which had grown more intense in the 18th century. Prussia, under Frederick the Great, had emerged as a major European power, and Sybel finds cause for the dispute in early 19th-century Prussian historiography. It continues with the founding of the German Empire under Bismarck in 1871, which had become possible with the Prussian victory over Austria in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Historians have argued that it continued into the 20th century, with Hitler's \"Anschluss\" of 1938 as one high point.\n\nThe disagreement over the politics of the medieval Empire was important because those should determine the political direction and the national identity of the first national German state. Comments by Friedrich Wilhelm von Giesebrecht, who like Sybel was a student of Leopold von Ranke, provoked Sybel into taking a public position. In his \"Geschichte der deutschen Kaiserzeit\" (1855–1888), Giesebrecht wrote: \"Moreover, the period of the Empire is the era whan our people, strengthened through unity, had risen to a position of power where it could not only freely determine its own fate, but could also commandeer other peoples, and where the German man exercised his greatest power in the world and the German name had the richest sound\". Sybel countered that throughout the period of the Empire, starting with Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, \"national\" interests had been betrayed while the Empire pursued interests in Italy, that its interest in the affairs of the Kingdom of Italy had led only to meaningless loss of life. This was different, according to Sybel, under Otto's father, Henry the Fowler, but after him German politics were aimed in the wrong direction: \"The powers of the nation, which at first and correctly following instinct had been directed toward the great colonization of the east, were afterwards aimed at an always alluring and always incorrect gleam of power south of the Alps.\".\n\nSybel's position suggested the kind of imperialist thinking that found its expression in the famous \"Drang nach Osten\" phrase and had become a reality in the \"Ostsiedlung\", the migration and settlement of German-speaking peoples during the Holy Roman Empire. Sybel leaned on this development, even though it hadn't started under Heinrich I but rather in the 12th century, first past the Elbe and then across the Oder, the settlement that had created Prussia, Saxony, and Silesia in Slavic areas. At the inception of the \"Alldeuscher Verband\", this movement was reiterated: \"The old drive toward the East should be restored\". The development by Friedrich Ratzel, in 1898, of the idea of \"Lebensraum\" supported this settler colonialism, which came to be seen as an alternative for the transatlantic migration to America..\n\n"}
{"id": "56056708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56056708", "title": "Tattooed Lady", "text": "Tattooed Lady\n\nTattooed ladies were working class women who acquired tattoos and performed in circuses, sideshows, and dime show museums as means for earning a substantial living. At the height of their popularity during the turn of the 20th century, tattooed ladies transgressed Victorian gender norms by showcasing their bodies in scantily clad clothing and earned a salary considerably larger than their male counterparts.Tattooed ladies often used captivity narratives as a means for excusing their appearance, and to tantalize the audience. The popularity of tattooed ladies waned with the onset of television.\n\nThirty years before tattooed women exploded on the sideshow and dime museum circuit scene, a young, white woman made national headlines with her unusual appearance and frightening story. During her family's westward emigration along the Santa Fe Trail in 1851, the Yavapi took thirteen-year-old Olive Oatman, along with her seven year old sister Mary Ann, captive. The Oatman girls lived with the Yavapi until they were traded to the Mojave with whom they lived with until Mary Ann's death and Olive's subsequent rescue on February 22, 1856, Under the assumption that her entire family was deceased and that rescue proved impossible, Olive assimilated to Mojave culture and acquired chin and arm tattoos as a means for identifying herself in the afterlife. According to Amelia Klem Osterud, Oatman's story parted with traditional captivity narratives and Victorian gender norms since she didn't \"wither and die\" due to her experience. Oatman deliberately reconciled her identity as an adopted Mojave with her new one as a marked white woman by traveling on a lecture circuit with her ghostwriter, Royal B. Stratton. Olive's decision to sensationalize her narrative for profit and to exclude intimate aspects of it for self-protection demonstrate an astute awareness of her predicament. Since US society would not have tolerated Oatman's choice to assimilate into Mojave culture, or even accept her as a transcultural individual, she purposefully recast herself as a victim of outside brutality. In this way, Oatman garnered more nods of sympathy and support rather than stares of disgust. In turn, her story served as the model for future working-class women to exploit through mythical and scandalously revealing narratives. Using the victim narrative allowed women such as Oatman, and the ones who copied her story, to display their bodies for profit in a way that just passed for respectable during the Victorian era.\n\nGetting started in the tattoo performing business was relatively quick and easy. Circuses and dime museums always searched for new and exciting acts and even went as far as posting wanted ads in newspapers for tattooed ladies. Also, acquiring tattoos proved to be an accessible, as well as affordable, investment with a massive payoff. During the late 1890s to early 1900s, tattoo artists typically charged less than a dollar for small tattoos, while a full body job totaled thirty dollars and took less than two months to complete. Performing in sideshows brought in serious cash; depending on her popularity, a tattooed lady made anywhere from $100 to $200 weekly during the turn of the century. Amelia Klem Osterud further expands on the significance of this salary:\"Teachers were making an average of $7 a week in 1900, which generally included room and board; in 1909, clerical workers were only earning about $22 a week […] while the average weekly salary for a man working in a factory or some other industrial job in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was only $9.\"The \"Roanoke Daily\" reported in 1895 that an unnamed tattooed woman, \"was paid $100 a day,\" and,\"[…]the fairy tale about her, as told by the showman, only heightened the crowd's interest and harmed nobody. She was represented in the story as having been stranded on one of the Sandwich islands, shipwrecked with her husband, who was put to death. Her life was spared, but she was put to torture, having these extraordinary characters tattooed all over her body. There from 500 to 700 people at each other the 21 daily performances at which that tattooed woman was exhibited, and all were pleased at the show, for which they paid 10 cents. \"Do many of these freaks, remarkable for various reasons, get fine salaries?\" \"Indeed they do.\"This excerpt from the \"Roanoke Daily\" also provides insight into 'smoke and mirrors' aspect of work as a tattooed lady. Referring to this unknown tattooed woman's story as a harmless fairytale reveals an awareness that Victorians held. Many knew the falsehood of these captivity stories, yet gladly spent their money to hear them for the sake of entertainment, as well as a chance to satiate their curiosity to see the female body in an uncharacteristic form. In this way, working-class tattooed ladies knowingly tapped into a market that turned the tables on their high-class counterparts by exploiting their gaze for sky-high prices. Other working-class women did not hesitate to justify their reasoning for becoming tattooed performers. In a revealing 1884 \"Sedalia Weekly Bazoo\" interview, tattooed lady Mary Baum shared a candid and similar start up story when asked where she got the idea to acquire tattoos from; \"I don't know exactly,\" said the varicolored lady. \"I saw the other tattooed ladies in museums, and thought it would be nice.\"\n\nIt is important to note that while tattooed women did indeed earn substantially more than their working-class male counterparts, their salary was not necessarily steady. A tattooed woman's earnings depended on the seasons, popularity and success of the circus or dime museum she associated with, and competition from other tattooed performers. Some tattooed women expanded their reach beyond the tent and secured additional income by advertising products. For example, in an advertisement headlined: \"Punctured Purity: A Wonderfully Tattooed\" \"Lady, Nature and Art Perforated— A Beauty,\" Irene Woodward's name is used to sell pain-reducing St. Jacob's Oil;\"Miss Irene was tattooed by her father and underwent what was to her a period of delightful suffering for seven years. The young lady during that time suffered, of course, but were we to undergo such a delightful piece of needlework, it is needless to say that we would want in close proximity a bottle of […] St. Jacob's Oil […]I consider it as far superior to any other medicine in curative power, as Miss Woodward, from an artistic point, is above a bit of bric a brac.\"Whether or not Irene profited directly off of the advertisement remains unknown, however, the media exposure assisted in gaining popularity and a wider audience. Ultimately, the positive wording in the advertisement, including the mention that Irene is above using a faulty product, attempted to elevate her into a respectable status.\n\nUnlike the ease of acquiring tattoos, gaining respectability occurred with great difficulty. The consequences of acquiring tattoos and performing in skimpy outfits weighed heavily tattooed ladies. Irene Woodward's appearance served as a mark of deviancy and most members of society found her exposed tattooed body repulsive outside of the high top. With this in mind, Victorians hardly viewed circuses and dime museums as beacons for good, clean family fun. Nonetheless, they remained curious and captivated by Irene's tantalizing story. In order to toe the line between virtue and nonconformity, Irene's media splash in the New York Times provided insight as to how both tattooed ladies and media outlets strategically crafted their image as respectable;\"Miss Woodward remarked that she felt a little bashful about being looked at that way, never having worn the costume in the pretense of men before.The tattooing, which was done in India ink, appeared artistic, and the devices were carried and attractive. Around the neck was observed a floral necklace. Dependent from this was a bunch of roses in full bloom dropping until their graceful forms were lost beneath the lace edging of the bodice…the arms were covered with stars hearts, floating angels, wreaths, harps, crosses, a full-rigged ship, and various mottoes.\"Prefacing Irene's name with 'Miss', along with referencing her reluctance to reveal herself in front of male figures for the first time reflects the attempt to legitimize her status as a proper lady, and softens the transgressive nature of her appearance. Irene's first time occurred every time she presented her body before audiences; this served undoubtedly as a way to 'exclusivize' her display from city to city and to attract droves of spectators. The vivid descriptions of her tattoos, along with the use of the words: bashful, artistic, attractive, floral and graceful as descriptors served as a way to further elevate, as well as feminize, Irene's appearance. Other performers, such as Miss Creole and Miss Alawanda, adopted similar media tools in their presentation. As tattooed ladies became more commonplace in circuses and dime museums, the opportunities that came with the twentieth century also forced tattooed ladies to face new challenges. In order to stay exotic within the realm of changing ideas concerning respectability, these women thought of innovative narratives to compete with each other, as well as to recapture the attention of audiences. These women shifted the Victorian victim narrative to one that demonstrates elements of deliberate choice in becoming a 'self-made freak'. In a greater sense, the act of exposing their bodies for pay, and even operating independently without subordinating themselves to a male boss, defied traditionally held social expectations concerning a woman's bodily autonomy.\n\nTrue to their career-driven investment, tattooed ladies kept covered to not only prevent free shows, thus keeping their exoticism fresh, but to also prevent the wear and tear tattoos suffer over the course of aging and through regular sun exposure. Tattooed ladies strategically placed their tattoos in such a way that allowed them to dress modestly in public and to function in their daily lives unnoticed. Photographs of popular tattooed ladies reveal that their tattoos did not extend past their forearms, above their neck or below their ankles. In addition, many of these ladies' bore tattoos that included religious and patriotic iconography. Whether this was for personal preference or as a means of self-expression is not known, however, the organization and thematic nature of these tattoos demonstrate a common pattern. Tattooed ladies used such images to elevate the status of their tattoos as a proper art form worthy of display and as a way to soften the blow of their nonconforming bodies for spectators. Even the Ringling Brothers Circus management remained cognizant of this and encouraged employees, particularly women, to maintain respectable behavior on and off stage to dispel stereotyping associated with their acts; \"we should want the \"Town folks\" to feel that the \"Show folks\" are real men and women and ladies and gentlemen as well.\" In this way, the image of respectability encompassed not only a tattooed woman personally, but the entire reputation of the show she worked for.\n\nNora Hildebrandt, one of the first tattooed ladies to perform in the US, wildly fictionalized her pasts to attract audiences captivated by her scandalous outfits, as well as the sexual undertones of her forced tattooing by Native Americans. In a pamphlet published around 1882, Hildebrandt's outlandish backstory included not only captivity among Sitting Bull's tribe, but also forced tattooing by her own father:\"One of Sitting Bull's warriors accused him of trying to poison them, and the chief told the prisoner if he would tattoo his daughter he would give him his liberty— that he must tattoo her from her toes to her head…He was compelled to work six hours a day for one year before she was recused, accomplishing three hundred and sixty five designs.\"In reality, Nora Hildebrandt was born into poverty under a different name in London, England sometime in the 1850s. Nora likely met professional tattoo artist Martin Hildebrandt, who was often presented as her father or husband even though they did not actually marry, and allowed him to tattoo her entire body in 1882. Though the process of tattooing during the time period involved crudely hand-poked images and long hours of intense pain, Nora Hildebrandt's reward for becoming a self-made 'freak' was not kept secret. She enjoyed an exceptional amount of privilege as a tattooed lady. For example, the \"New York Clipper\" reported on March 22, 1884 that during her visit to Mexico, received\"the LARGEST AND MOST COSTLY PRESENTS EVER KNOWN [sic]…Among the presents may be mentioned a HANDSOME MUSTANG MENAGE PONY, SADDLE AND BRIDLE FROM PRESIDENT GONZALEZ, AND FROM HIS SON A PRECIOUS PAIR OF SOLITAIRE EARDROPS [sic].\" On the other hand, the media did not always behave kindly toward Hildebrandt. In a scathing 1882 review, the \"New York Times\" lambasted Nora's stout stature and masculine facial features; \"her face is [so] hard that you wonder they ever got the needle through the skin without a hammer.\" This statement reveals that no woman remained safe from oppressive societal standards of beauty. Indeed, a tattooed woman remained especially vulnerable to social commentary concerning aspects of her body outside of her control. With this in mind, how the media treated a tattooed lady ultimately determined her star's ability to rise. In turn, once tattooed women began to change their stories and use the media to their advantage, they experienced more longevity in their careers.\n\nNot much is known about Irene Woodward's origins before her career as a tattooed lady. In fact, the \"New York Times\" claimed that \"She was the daughter of a sailor who began the tattooing when she was but 6 years of age and finished it when she was 12. She was born near Dallas, Texas, and has spent the greater part of her life in the Western wilds. She conceived the idea of exhibiting herself after seeing the tattooed Greek in Denver.\"In a far less captivating story, Samuel O'Reilly and his not yet famous apprentice, Charles Wagner, tattooed Woodward. Unlike Nora Hilderbrant, Miss Creole and Miss Alawanda, Irene Woodward did not use the captivity narrative in full. Though her tattoos were still imposed from an outside individual, the implication that her father completed them suggests that the imposition came from within Western cultural practices rather than external ones. Irene Woodward's unusually honest statement proves that her motive came from a place far deeper than her ink. She saw a male tattooed performer, the possibility of securing a living by replicating him, and reinvented herself.\n\nAs women began to experience greater social freedom due to suffrage, the New Woman Movement and the absence of male competition in the workforce during both World Wars, the tattoo evolved into a solidified marker of working-class folk art. Undoubtedly, tattooed women still faced harsh scrutiny for their appearance. However, with their limited options taken into consideration, the pay-off was ultimately worth it and women during the time period continued to perform. During the 1930s and onward, tattooed ladies deviated from fictionalized captivity narratives and boldly accounted for their choice of profession more freely.\n\nWhen asked in 1931 why she acquired her tattoos, May Vandermark quipped, \"I love Art…and that's true, too—up to a certain point…I mean, I like to eat regular.\" Vandermark found that performing as a tattooed lady garnered a higher profit than working as a stenographer. According to a 1927 article in the \"Milwaukee Sentinel\", Vandermark saw another woman with a small tattoo while swimming at Coney Island and decided she wanted one. Upon acquiring two, she met and became \"great friends\" with tattooed performer Lotta Pictoria \"who persuaded Mae to be a professional.\" In the same article, Lotta Pictoria is referenced as the person who introduced Vandermark to Charles Wagner and helped her gain a full body suit over the course of ten months for the bargain price of $130. This suggests that Lotta Pictoria mentored or showed Mae Vandermark the ropes of performing as a tattooed lady, shared her social connections with her and helped launched her career.\n\nInitially, she performed as the youngest tattooed woman ever during the 1920s, however, by the time bathing suits and hemlines rose, Broadbent decided to shock the public when she entered a beauty pageant at the World's Fair in 1939. While she had no chance of winning, Broadbent enjoyed the attention and free advertising, and assured her audiences that her wholesome act stood apart from \"those carnival floozies with one or two tattoos who would bump and grind.\" Like Mae Vandermark, Broadbent's tattoos also bore references to pop culture icons and ones suited to her individual taste; she sported images of Charlie Chaplin and Charles Lindberg. In this way, Broadbent reflects the tattoo's permanence in American folk culture as an art form steadily gaining recognition. Incidentally, Broadbent's tattoos suggest a deliberate attempt to express oneself through choice rather than imposition or affliction. Broadbent's overt challenge to traditional female behavior also substantiated her tattoo narrative. Gone were the days of having to invent a victim tale to excuse her status as a tattooed lady. In fact, her souvenir postcard bluntly dispelled any mystery surrounding her choice in getting tattooed; \"It was done for professional reasons only. I have no regrets for having chosen this most unusual career.\" Broadbent's 1956 pay stub for $220 suggests no need for regrets, as her earnings were significantly high.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, business started to lag for many artists and tattooed ladies since circus shows and dime museums fell out of vogue. As the postwar era hailed a sense of conformity and normalcy, tattoos decreased in popularity and once again became stigmatized due to their longstanding association with criminal activity. Still, a small group of tattooed women, whose youth and ink faded considerably by this time, continued to perform where an audience gathered. One of the last to perform, Artoria Gibbons performed well into her eighties during the 1980s not necessarily for money, but for the love of performance art. Though not as visible or discussed as often, tattooed ladies moonlighted as artists during their off seasons alongside their husbands. Many of these tattooed ladies learned the craft of professional tattooing from their significant others and paved the way for a new generation of women to secure their livings by creating feminine styles of flash in their own shops.\n\n\n"}
