Filled with the compassion at the sight of these men perishing from hunger and misery, St. Acacius resolved to help them. He assembled his clergy and addressed them in this manner:\n\nOur God, my brethren, needs neither dishes nor cups; for He neither eats nor drinks, nor is in want of anything. Since then, by the liberality of its faithful members the Church possesses many vessels both of gold and silver, it behooves us to sell them, that by the money thus raised, we may be able to redeem the prisoners and also supply them with food.\n\nBishop Acacius sold all the precious golden and silver sacred vessels of his church and ransomed, clothed and fed the seven thousand.

{"id": "93423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93423", "title": "Asser", "text": "Asser\n\nAsser (died c. 909) was a Welsh monk from St David's, Dyfed, who became Bishop of Sherborne in the 890s. About 885 he was asked by Alfred the Great to leave St David's and join the circle of learned men whom Alfred was recruiting for his court. After spending a year at Caerwent because of illness, Asser accepted.\n\nIn 893 Asser wrote a biography of Alfred, called the \"Life of King Alfred\". The manuscript survived to modern times in only one copy, which was part of the Cotton library. That copy was destroyed in a fire in 1731, but transcriptions that had been made earlier, together with material from Asser's work which was included by other early writers, have enabled the work to be reconstructed. The biography is the main source of information about Alfred's life and provides far more information about Alfred than is known about any other early English ruler. Asser assisted Alfred in his translation of Gregory the Great's \"Pastoral Care\", and possibly with other works.\n\nAsser is sometimes cited as a source for the legend about Alfred's having founded the University of Oxford, which is now known to be false. A short passage making this claim was interpolated by William Camden into his 1603 edition of Asser's \"Life\". Doubts have also been raised periodically about whether the entire \"Life\" is a forgery, written by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as genuine.\n\nAsser (also known as John Asser or Asserius Menevensis) was a Welsh monk who lived from at least AD 885 until about 909. Almost nothing is known of Asser's early life. The name Asser is likely to have been taken from Aser, or Asher, the eighth son of Jacob in Genesis. Old Testament names were common in Wales at the time, but it has been suggested that this name may have been adopted at the time Asser entered the church. Asser may have been familiar with a work by St Jerome on the meaning of Hebrew names (Jerome's given meaning for \"Asser\" was \"blessed\"), so it is possible that Asser's birth name was \"Gwyn\" (or \"Guinn\"), which is Welsh for \"blessed\" (or \"blessedness\").\n\nAccording to his \"Life of King Alfred\", Asser was a monk at St David's in what was then the kingdom of Dyfed, in south-west Wales. Asser makes it clear that he was brought up in the area, and was tonsured, trained and ordained there. He also mentions Nobis, a bishop of St David's who died in 873 or 874, as being a kinsman of his.\n\nMuch of what is known about Asser comes from his biography of Alfred, in particular a short section in which Asser recounts how Alfred recruited him as a scholar for his court. Alfred held a high opinion of the value of learning and recruited men from around Britain and from continental Europe to establish a scholarly centre at his court. It is not known how Alfred heard of Asser, but one possibility relates to Alfred's overlordship of south Wales. Several kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of Glywysing and Hyfaidd of Dyfed (where Asser's monastery was), had submitted to Alfred's overlordship in 885. Asser gives a fairly detailed account of the events. There is a charter of Hywel's which has been dated to c. 885; amongst the witnesses is one \"Asser\", which may be the same person. Hence it is possible that Alfred's relationship with the southern Welsh kings led him to hear of Asser.\n\nAsser recounts meeting Alfred first at the royal estate at Dean, Sussex (now East and West Dean, West Sussex). Asser provides only one datable event in his history: on St Martin's Day, 11 November 887, Alfred decided to learn to read Latin. Working backwards from this, it appears most likely that Asser was recruited by Alfred in early 885.\n\nAsser's response to Alfred's request was to ask for time to consider the offer, as he felt it would be unfair to abandon his current position in favour of worldly recognition. Alfred agreed but also suggested that he should spend half his time at St David's and half with Alfred. Asser again asked for time to consider, but ultimately agreed to return to Alfred with an answer in six months. On his return to Wales, however, Asser fell ill with a fever and was confined to the monastery of Caerwent for twelve months and a week. Alfred wrote to find out the cause of the delay, and Asser responded that he would keep his promise when he recovered. When he did recover, in 886, he agreed to divide his time between Wales and Alfred's court, as Alfred had suggested. Others at St David's supported this, since they hoped Asser's influence with Alfred would avoid \"damaging afflictions and injuries at the hands of King Hyfaidd (who often assaulted that monastery and the jurisdiction of St David)\".\n\nAsser joined several other noted scholars at Alfred's court, including Grimbald, and John the Old Saxon; all three probably reached Alfred's court within a year of each other. His first extended stay with Alfred was at the royal estate at Leonaford, probably from about April through December 886. It is not known where Leonaford was; a case has been made for Landford, in Wiltshire. Asser records that he read aloud to the king from the books at hand. On Christmas Eve, 886, after Asser had for some time failed to obtain permission to return to Wales, Alfred gave Asser the monasteries of Congresbury and Banwell, along with a silk cloak and a quantity of incense \"weighing as much as a stout man.\" He allowed Asser to visit his new possessions and thence to return to St David's.\n\nThereafter Asser seems to have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives no information about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It is evident from Asser's account that he spent a good deal of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.\n\nSometime between 887 and 892, Alfred gave Asser the monastery of Exeter. Asser subsequently became Bishop of Sherborne, though the year of succession is unknown. Asser's predecessor as Bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige, attested a charter in 892. Asser's first appearance in the position is in 900, when he appears as a witness to a charter; hence the succession can only be dated to the years 892 to 900. In any event, Asser had already been a bishop prior to his appointment to the see of Sherborne, since Wulfsige is known to have received a copy of Alfred's \"Pastoral Care\" in which Asser is described as a bishop.\n\nIt is possible that Asser was a suffragan bishop within the see of Sherborne, but he may instead have been a bishop of St David's. He is listed as such in Giraldus Cambrensis's \"Itinerarium Cambriae\", although this may be unreliable as it was written three centuries later, in 1191. A contemporary clue is found in Asser's own writing: he mentions that bishops of St David's were sometimes expelled by King Hyfaidd and adds that \"he even expelled me on occasion.\" This also implies that Asser was himself a bishop of St David's.\n\nIn 893, Asser wrote a biography of Alfred entitled \"The Life of King Alfred\"; in the original Latin, the title is \"Vita Ælfredi regis Angul Saxonum\". The date is known from Asser's mention of the king's age in the text. The work, which is less than twenty thousand words long, is one of the most important sources of information on Alfred the Great.\n\nAsser drew on a variety of texts to write his \"Life\". The style is similar to that of two biographies of Louis the Pious: \"Vita Hludovici Imperatoris\", written c. 840 by an unknown author usually called \"the Astronomer\", and \"Vita Hludowici Imperatoris\" by Thegan of Trier. It is possible that Asser may have known these works. He also knew Bede's \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\"; the \"Historia Brittonum\", a Welsh source; the \"Life of Alcuin\"; and the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". It is also clear from the text that Asser was familiar with Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Caelius Sedulius's \"Carmen Paschale\", Aldhelm's \"De Virginitate\", and Einhard's \"Vita Karoli Magni\" (\"Life of Charlemagne\"). He quotes from Gregory the Great's \"Regula Pastoralis\", a work he and Alfred subsequently collaborated in translating, and from Augustine of Hippo's \"Enchiridion\". About half of the \"Life\" is little more than a translation of part of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" for the years 851–887, though Asser adds personal opinions and interpolates information about Alfred's life. Asser also adds material relating to the years after 887 and general opinions about Alfred's character and reign.\n\nAsser's prose style has been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His frequent use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, but it is also possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.\n\nThe \"Life\" ends abruptly with no concluding remarks and it is considered likely that the manuscript is an incomplete draft. Asser lived a further fifteen or sixteen years and Alfred a further six, but no events after 893 are recorded.\n\nIt is possible that the work was written principally for the benefit of a Welsh audience. Asser takes pains to explain local geography, so he was clearly considering an audience not familiar with the areas he described. More specifically, at several points he gives an English name and follows it with the Welsh equivalent, even in the case of Nottingham, which seems unlikely to have had a native Welsh name. As a result, and given that Alfred's overlordship of south Wales was recent, it may be that Asser intended the work to acquaint a Welsh readership with Alfred's personal qualities and reconcile them to his rule. However, it is also possible that Asser's inclusion of Welsh placenames simply reflects an interest in etymology or the existence of a Welsh audience in his own household rather than in Wales. There are also sections such as the support for Alfred's programme of fortification that give the impression of the book's being aimed at an English audience.\n\nAsser's \"Life\" omits any mention of internal strife or dissent in Alfred's own reign, though when he mentions that Alfred had to harshly punish those who were slow to obey Alfred's commands to fortify the realm, he makes it clear that Alfred did have to enforce obedience. Asser's life is a one-sided treatment of Alfred, though since Alfred was alive when it was composed, it is unlikely to contain gross errors of fact.\n\nIn addition to being the primary source for Alfred's life, Asser's work is also a source for other historical periods, where he adds material to his translation of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". For example, he tells a story about Eadburh, the daughter of Offa. Eadburh married Beorhtric, king of the West Saxons. Asser describes her as behaving \"like a tyrant\" and ultimately accidentally poisoning Beorhtric in an attempt to murder someone else. He finishes by describing her death as a beggar in Pavia. This Eadburh is not the same as Alfred's mother-in-law, also named Eadburh, whom Asser mentions elsewhere.\n\nThe early manuscript of the \"Life\" does not appear to have been widely known in medieval times. Only one copy is known to have survived into modern times. It is known as Cotton MS Otho A xii, and was part of the Cotton library. It was written about 1000 and was destroyed in a fire in 1731. The lack of distribution may be because Asser had not finished the manuscript and so did not have it copied. However, the material in the \"Life\" is recognizable in other works. There is some evidence from early writers of access to versions of Asser's work, as follows:\n\n\nThe history of the Cotton manuscript itself is quite complex. The list of early writers above mentions that it may have been in the possession of at least two of them. It was owned by John Leland, the antiquary, in the 1540s. It probably became available after the dissolution of the monasteries, in which the property of many religious houses was confiscated and sold. Leland died in 1552 and it is known to have been in the possession of Matthew Parker from some time after that until his own death in 1575. Although Parker bequeathed most of his library to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, the Cotton manuscript was not included. By 1600, it was in the library of Lord Lumley and by 1621 the manuscript was in the possession of Robert Cotton. The Cotton library was moved in 1712 from Cotton House in Westminster to Essex House in the Strand and then moved again in 1730 to Ashburnham House in Westminster. On the morning of Saturday, 23 October 1731, a fire broke out and the Cotton manuscript was destroyed.\n\nAs a result, the text of Asser's \"Life\" is known from a multitude of different sources. Various transcripts had been made of the Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of the first page of the manuscript had been made and published, giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe. In addition to these transcripts, the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text. Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if they were part of the text, scholarly editions have had a difficult burden. There have been multiple editions of \"The Life\" published, both in Latin and in translation. The 1904 critical edition (with 130 pages of introduction) by W. H. Stevenson, \"Asser's Life of King Alfred, together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser\", still provides the standard Latin text: this was translated into English in 1905 by Albert S. Cook. An important recent translation, with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues, is \"Alfred the Great: Asser's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources\" by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge.\n\nIn 1603 the antiquarian William Camden published an edition of Asser's \"Life\" in which there appears a story of a community of scholars at Oxford, who were visited by Grimbald:\nIn the year of our Lord 886, the second year of the arrival of St Grimbald in England, the University of Oxford was begun ... John, monk of the church of St David, giving lectures in logic, music and arithmetic; and John, the monk, colleague of St Grimbald, a man of great parts and a universal scholar, teaching geometry and astronomy before the most glorious and invincible King Alfred.\nThere is no support for this in any source known. Camden based his edition on Parker's manuscript, other transcripts of which do not include any such material. It is now acknowledged that this is an interpolation of Camden's, though the legend itself first surfaced in the 14th century. Older books about Alfred the Great include the legend: for example, Jacob Abbott's 1849 \"Alfred the Great\" says that \"One of the greatest and most important of the measures which Alfred adopted for the intellectual improvement of his people was the founding of the great University of Oxford.\"\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, several scholars asserted that Asser's biography of King Alfred was not authentic, but a forgery. A prominent claim was made in 1964 by the respected historian V.H. Galbraith in his essay \"Who Wrote Asser's Life of Alfred?\" Galbraith argued that there were anachronisms in the text that meant it could not have been written during Asser's lifetime. For example, Asser uses \"rex Angul Saxonum\" (\"king of the Anglo-Saxons\") to refer to Alfred. Galbraith asserted that this usage does not appear until the late 10th century. Galbraith also identified the use of \"parochia\" to refer to Exeter as an anachronism, arguing that it should be translated as \"diocese\" and hence that it referred to the bishopric of Exeter, which was not created until 1050. Galbraith identified the true author as Leofric, who became Bishop of Devon and Cornwall in 1046. Leofric's motive, according to Galbraith, was to justify the re-establishment of his see at Exeter by demonstrating a precedent for the arrangement.\n\nThe title \"king of the Anglo-Saxons\" does, however, in fact occur in royal charters that date to before 892 and \"parochia\" does not necessarily mean \"diocese\", but can sometimes refer just to the jurisdiction of a church or monastery. In addition, there are other arguments against Leofric's having been the forger. Aside from the fact that Leofric would have known little about Asser and so would have been unlikely to construct a plausible forgery, there is strong evidence dating the Cotton manuscript to about 1000. The apparent use of Asser's material in other early works that predate Leofric also argues against Galbraith's theory. Galbraith's arguments were refuted to the satisfaction of most historians by Dorothy Whitelock in \"Genuine Asser\", in the Stenton Lecture of 1967.\n\nMore recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth has argued that the \"Life\" is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing his case primarily on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour doubts about the authenticity of the work.\n\nIn addition to the \"Life of King Alfred\", Asser is credited by Alfred as one of several scholars who assisted with Alfred's translation of Gregory's \"Regula Pastoralis\" (\"Pastoral Care\"). The historian William of Malmesbury, writing in the 12th century, believed that Asser also assisted Alfred with his translation of Boethius.\n\nThe \"Annales Cambriae,\" a set of Welsh annals that were probably kept at St David's, records Asser's death in the year 908. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" records the following entry as part of the entry for 909 or 910 (in different versions of the chronicle): \"Here Frithustan succeeded to the bishopric in Winchester, and after that Asser, who was bishop at Sherborne, departed.\" The year given by the chronicle was uncertain, because different chroniclers started the new year at different calendar dates, and Asser's date of death is generally given as 908/909.\n\n\n"}

Many of these joined the Partisan forces and participated in their activities at Bar.\n\nThe victims were Albanian recruits from Kosovo, who had been pressed by the Yugoslav Partisans into service. These men were then assembled in Prizren and marched on foot in three columns to Bar where they were supposed to receive short training and then sent off to the front. The march took the rugged mountain ranges of Kosovo and Montenegro to reach its destination. Upon arrival locals reported that these men, who had marched a considerable distance, were \"exhausted\" and \"distressed\". The column of men which stretched a few kilometres were then gathered on the Barkso Polje. At one point, in Polje, one of the Albanians from the column attacked and killed one of the Yugoslav officers, Boža Dabanovića. Very soon after that somebody from the column threw a smuggled bomb at the commander of the brigade. This created a panic among the Partisans. The guards watching over the recruits then fired into the crowd killing many and prompting the survivors to flee into the surrounding mountains. In another case, several hundred Albanians were herded into a tunnel, near Bar, which was subsequently sealed off so that all of those trapped within the tunnel were asphyxiated. \n\nYugoslav sources put the number of victims at 400 while Albanian sources put the figure at 2,000 killed in Bar alone. According to Croatian historian Ljubica Štefan, the Partisans killed 1,600 Albanians in Bar on 1 April after an incident at a fountain. There are also accounts claiming that the victims included young boys. Other sources cited that the killing started en route for no apparent reason and this was supported by the testimony of in his 1949 trial. Themeli was a collaborator who worked as an important official of the Sigurimi, the Albanian secret police. After the massacre, the site was immediately covered in concrete by the Yugoslav communist regime and built an airport on top of the mass grave.\n"}

Two of her books, \"Downright Dencey\" and \"The Forgotten Daughter\", were runners-up for the Newbery Medal. On occasion she used the pen name Caroline Dale Owen.\n\nCaroline Dale Parke was born on March 23, 1871, in New Harmony, Indiana, to Nina Dale (Owen) and Charles Augustus Parke, a banker. Her great-grandfather was Robert Owen, one of Britain’s first social reformers and industrialists. Her grandfather was David Dale Owen, a geologist for the United States Geological Survey and the first state geologist for the states of Indiana, Kentucky, and Arkansas.\n\nParke grew up near Mount Vernon, Indiana, in a family with three sisters (Ada Owen, Anna Crawford, and Nina Dale) and a brother (Julius Leonard). The family later moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where she attended the College of Music. Parke and her sisters performed instrumental concerts to support the family after the death of their father 1902. Parke, the pianist in the group, later became a music instructor. She married Charles Henry Snedeker (1856–1927) in 1903, and moved to Hempstead, New York. Eventually, she moved to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and died on January 22, 1956, at the age of 84. Her remains are interred at Live Oak Cemetery in Harrison County, Mississippi.\n\nSnedeker's writings consist of 12 or 13 novels for older children or teens and two or three books for adults, along with a handful of other articles, stories and poems. The majority of her novels were inspired by her love for the ancient world and are set in Greece or the Roman Empire. She also based a series on American history. The morals of her time can be found throughout her novels, especially in the texts aimed at young adults.\n\nSnedeker's first book,\"The Coward of Thermopylae\", appeared for adults in 1911. It gained popularity in 1912 when it was reissued for young adults and re-titled \"The Spartan\". The novel is about an Athenian soldier named Aristodemos, who travels to Sparta and trains to fight in Thermopylae. At first considered a coward, he acquits himself with a noble death. The great response to these novels sparked requests for a children's version. In 1924 Snedeker published \"Theras and His Town\" (1924). Theras is an eleven-year-old boy who moved from Athens to Sparta where he experiences a brutal life under Spartan control and attempts to escape back to Athens. \"The Forgotten Daughter\" (1933) is also set in Ancient Rome, and is a Newbery Honor Book.\n\nSnedeker also wrote novels based on American history. The best known is \"Downright Dencey\", a 1928 Newbery Honor Book, which tells of a friendship between a Quaker girl and a waif in Nantucket at the early 19th century. In the sequel, \"The Beckoning Road\" (1929), Dencey's family moves to New Harmony.\n\nSnedeker also wrote and published several successful romance novels. As a result of her popularity, some of her novels were translated into other languages, including Dutch and German.\n\nSnedeker's mother and grandmother were influences on her career. She grew up listening to her mother's singing and to her grandmother's stories of New Harmony. This sparked Snedeker's interest in history, writing and music at an early age. Having a close relationship with her mother and grandmother led Snedeker to write \"Town of the Fearless\" (1931), about the history of her family and their relation with New Harmony.\n\nOngoing themes in Snedeker's novels include nobility and \"good, old-fashioned values.\" Caroline Snedeker was exceptionally interested in history, literature and classical music, which is shown throughout her works.\n\n\nSnedeker's two non-fiction books in the LC online catalog both carry the Library of Congress Subject Heading \"New Harmony (Ind.)—History\".\n\n\nTwo of her novels also feature New Harmony, Indiana: \"Seth Way\" and the sequel to \"Downright Dencey\", \"The Beckoning Road\".\n\n"}

She is mainly noted for her contributions to the field of pre-Columbian American archaeology, in particular for her work on Mesoamerican cultures in central Mexico.\n\nChristine Niederberger was born in Bordeaux, France, the daughter of Roger Betton and Linka Lowczynski. She began her higher education at the l'École supérieures nationales des langues orientales. From 1965 to 1968, she continued a training in archaeology at the National School of History and Anthropology (ENAH) in Mexico. Its beginnings works of archaeologists will take place with Tlapacoya, precisely on the site of Zohapilco. The results of this excavation lead it to present her thesis in 1974 entitled: \"Zohapilco. Cinco milenios of ocupación humana en un sitio lacustre de la Cuenca de México\". A few years later, in 1981, Christine Niederberger obtains a doctorate of State at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences, in Paris. The subject of her doctorate, under the direction of Jean Guilaine, is entitled \"Paléopaysages and pre-urban archaeology of the basin of Mexico\". This thesis became a reference and will be published by the Center of Mexican Studies and Centraméricaines (CEMCA) in 1987.\n\nShe was married to Jean-Marie Niederberger.\n\nIts search and its excavations, as archaeologist, were particularly innovative and founder of a new school of thought. On the one hand, she called into question a chronology proposed for the site of Zohapilco, on the level of the occupations in connection with Olmec style. In addition, she strongly contributed to change the generally accepted ideas, about olmec culture which is not limited to the Zona Metropolitana Olmeca (ZMO), in English, refer to as the Olmec heartland. At the contrary the Olmec culture was a multi-ethnic unit and pluri-linguistic culture covering a vast part of the Mesoamerica, in the period from 1200 BC to about 500 BC. The model of Christine Niederberger thus shows the unit of Middle America from 1200 BC through the olmec style identified by a particular appearance: pan-Mesoamerica.\n\nShe was a great professionalist and an extremely meticulous persons on the excavations.

{"id": "5016265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5016265", "title": "Expressionist architecture", "text": "Expressionist architecture\n\nExpressionist architecture is an architectural movement in Europe during the first decades of the 20th century in parallel with the expressionist visual and performing arts that especially developed and dominated in Germany. Brick Expressionism is a special variant of this movement in western and northern Germany and in The Netherlands (Amsterdam School). Expressionist architecture is one of the three dominant styles of Modern architecture (International Style, Expressionist- and Constructivist architecture).\n\nThe term \"Expressionist architecture\" initially described the activity of the German, Dutch, Austrian, Czech and Danish avant garde from 1910 until 1930. Subsequent redefinitions extended the term backwards to 1905 and also widened it to encompass the rest of Europe. Today the meaning has broadened even further to refer to architecture of any date or location that exhibits some of the qualities of the original movement such as; distortion, fragmentation or the communication of violent or overstressed emotion.\n\nThe style was characterised by an early-modernist adoption of novel materials, formal innovation, and very unusual massing, sometimes inspired by natural biomorphic forms, sometimes by the new technical possibilities offered by the mass production of brick, steel and especially glass. Many expressionist architects fought in World War I and their experiences, combined with the political turmoil and social upheaval that followed the German Revolution of 1919, resulted in a utopian outlook and a romantic socialist agenda. Economic conditions severely limited the number of built commissions between 1914 and the mid-1920s, resulting in many of the most important expressionist works remaining as projects on paper, such as Bruno Taut's \"Alpine Architecture\" and Hermann Finsterlin's \"Formspiels\". Ephemeral exhibition buildings were numerous and highly significant during this period. Scenography for theatre and films provided another outlet for the expressionist imagination, and provided supplemental incomes for designers attempting to challenge conventions in a harsh economicate.\n\nImportant events in expressionist architecture include; the Werkbund Exhibition (1914) in Cologne, the completion and theatrical running of the Grosses Schauspielhaus, Berlin in 1919, the Glass Chain letters, and the activities of the Amsterdam School. The major permanent extant landmark of Expressionism is Erich Mendelsohn's Einstein Tower in Potsdam. By 1925 most of the leading architects of Expressionism such as; Bruno Taut, Erich Mendelsohn, Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe and Hans Poelzig, along with other Expressionists in the visual arts, had turned toward the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (New Objectivity) movement, a more practical and matter-of-fact approach which rejected the emotional agitation of expressionism. A few, notably Hans Scharoun, continued to work in an expressionist idiom.\n\nIn 1933, after the Nazi seizure of power in Germany, expressionist art was outlawed as degenerate. Until the 1970s scholars commonly played down the influence of the expressionists on the later International style, but this has been re-evaluated in recent years.\n\nExpressionist architecture was individualistic and in many ways eschewed aesthetic dogma, but it is still useful to develop some criteria which defines it. Though containing a great variety and differentiation, many points can be found as recurring in works of Expressionist architecture, and are evident in some degree in each of its works.\n\n\nPolitical, economic and artistic shifts provided a context for the early manifestations of expressionist architecture; particularly in Germany, where the utopian qualities of expressionism found strong resonances with a leftist artistic community keen to provide answers to a society in turmoil during and after the events of World War I. The loss of the war, the subsequent removal of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the depravations and the rise of social democracy and the optimism of the Weimar republic created a reluctance amongst architects to pursue projects initiated before the war and provided the impetus to seek new solutions. An influential body of the artistic community, including architects, sought a similar revolution as had occurred in Russia. The costly and grandiose remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus, was more reminiscent of the imperial past, than wartime budgeting and post-war depression.\n\nArtistic movements that preceded expressionist architecture and continued with some overlap were the arts and crafts movement and art nouveau or in Germany, jugendstil. Unity of designers with artisans, was a major preoccupation of the Arts and Crafts movement which extended into expressionist architecture. The frequent topic of naturalism in art nouveau, which was also prevalent in romanticism, continued as well, but took a turn for the more earthen than floral. The naturalist, Ernst Haeckel was known by Finsterlin and shared his source of inspiration in natural forms.\n\nThe Futurist and constructivist architectural movements, and the dada anti-art movement were occurring concurrently to expressionism and often contained similar features. Bruno Taut's magazine, \"Frülicht\" included constructivist projects, including Vladimir Tatlins \"Monument to the Third International\". However, futurism and constructivism emphasized mechination, and urbanism tendencies which were not to take hold in Germany until the Neue Sachlichkeit. Mendelsohn is an exception whose work bordered on futurism and constructivism. A quality of dynamic energy and exuberance exists in both the sketches of Erich Mendelsohn and futurist Antonio Sant'Elia. The \"Merzbau\" by Dada artist Kurt Schwitters, with its angular, abstract form, held many expressionist characteristics.\n\nInfluence of individualists such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Antoni Gaudí also provided the surrounding context for expressionist architecture. Portfolios of Wright were included in the lectures of Erich Mendelsohn and were well known to those in his circle. Gaudí was also both influenced and influencing what was happening in Berlin. In Barcelona, there was no abrupt break between the architecture of art nouveau and that of the early 20th century, where Jugendstil was opposed after 1900, and his work contains more of art nouveau than that of say Bruno Taut. The circle of der Ring, did know about Gaudí, as he was published in Germany, and Finsterlin was in correspondence. Charles Rennie Mackintosh should also be mentioned in the larger context surrounding expressionist architecture. Hard to classify as strictly arts and crafts or art nouveau, buildings such as the Hill House and his Ingram chairs have an expressionist tinge. His work was known on the continent, as it was exhibited at the Vienna Secession exhibition in 1900.\n\nMany writers contributed to the ideology of expressionist architecture. Sources of philosophy important to expressionist architects were works by Friedrich Nietzsche, Søren Kierkegaard, and Henri Bergson. Bruno Taut's sketches were frequently noted with quotations from Nietzsche, particularly \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", whose protagonist embodied freedoms dear to the expressionists; freedom to reject the bourgeois world, freedom from history, and strength of spirit in individualist isolation. Zarathustra's mountain retreat was an inspiration to Taut's \"Alpine Architecture\". Henri Van de Velde drew a title page illustration for Nietzsche's \"Ecce Homo\". The author Franz Kafka in his \"The Metamorphosis\", with its shape shifting matched the material instability of expressionist architecture Naturalists such as Charles Darwin, and Ernst Haeckel contributed an ideology for the biomorphic form of architects such as Herman Finsterlin. Poet Paul Scheerbart worked directly with Bruno Taut and his circle, and contributed ideas based on his poetry of glass architecture.\n\nEmergent psychology from Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung was important to expressionism. The exploration of psychological effects of form and space was undertaken by architects in their buildings, projects and films. Bruno Taut noted the psychological possibilities of scenographic design that, \"Objects serve psychologically to mirror the actors' emotions and gestures.\" The exploration of dreams and the unconscious, provided material for the formal investigations of Hermann Finsterlin.\n\nThroughout the 18th and 19th centuries philosophies of aesthetics had been developing, particularly through the work of Kant and Schopenhauer and notions of the sublime. The experience of the sublime was supposed to involve a self-forgetfulness where personal fear is replaced by a sense of well-being and security when confronted with an object exhibiting superior might. At the end of the nineteenth century the German Kunstwissenschaft, or the \"science of art\", arose, which was a movement to discern laws of aesthetic appreciation and arrive at a scientific approach to aesthetic experience. At the beginning of the twentieth century Neo-Kantian German philosopher and theorist of aesthetics Max Dessoir founded the Zeitschift für Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft, which he edited for many years, and published the work Ästhetik und allgemeine Kunstwissenschaft in which he formulated five primary aesthetic forms: the beautiful, the sublime, the tragic, the ugly, and the comic. Iain Boyd Whyte writes that whilst \"the Expressionist visionaries did not keep copies of Kant under their drawing boards. There was, however, in the first decades of this century [20th] a climate of ideas that was sympathetic to the aesthetic concerns and artistic production of romanticism.\n\nArtistic theories of Wassily Kandinsky, such as \"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\", and \"Point and Line to Plane\" were centerpieces of expressionist thinking.\n\nA recurring concern of expressionist architects was the use of materials and how they might be poetically expressed. Often, the intention was to unify the materials in a building so as to make it monolithic. The collaboration of Bruno Taut and the utopian poet Paul Scheerbart attempted to address the problems of German society by a doctrine of glass architecture. Such utopianism can be seen in the context of a revolutionary Germany where the tussle between nationalism and socialism had yet to resolve itself. Taut and Scheerbart imagined a society that had freed itself by breaking from past forms and traditions, impelled by an architecture that flooded every building with multicolored light and represented a more promising future. They published texts on this subject and built the Glass Pavilion at the 1914 Werkbund exhibition. Inscribed around the base of the dome were aphoristic sayings about the material, penned by Scheerbart.\nAnother example of expressionist use of monolithic materials was by Erich Mendelsohn at the Einstein Tower. Not to be missed was a pun on the towers namesake, \"Einstein\", and an attempt to make the building out of one stone, \"Ein stein\". Though not cast in one pour of concrete (due to technical difficulties, brick and stucco were used partially) the effect of the building is an expression of the fluidity of concrete before it is cast. 'Architecture of Steel and Concrete' was the title of a 1919 exhibition of Mendelsohn's sketches at Paul Cassirer's gallery in Berlin.\n\nBrick was used in a similar fashion to express the inherent nature of the material. Josef Franke produced some characteristic expressionist churches in the Ruhrgebiet in the 1920s. Bruno Taut used brick as a way to show mass and repetition in his Berlin Housing Estate \"Legien-Stadt\". In the same way as their Arts and Crafts movement predecessors, to expressionist architects, populism, naturalism, and according to Pehnt \"Moral and sometimes even irrational arguments were adduced in favor of building in brick\". With its color and pointillist like visual increment, brick became to expressionism what stucco later became to the international style.\n\nEurope witnessed a boom in theatrical production in the early twentieth century. In 1896 there were 302 permanent theatres in Europe, by 1926 there were 2,499. Cinema witnessed a comparable increase in its use and popularity and a resulting increase in the number of picture houses. It was also able to provide a temporary reality for innovative architectural ideas.\n\nMany architects designed theatres for performances on the stage and film sets for expressionist films. These were defining moments for the movement, and with its interest in theatres and films, the performing arts held a significant place in expressionist architecture. Like film, and theatre, expressionist architecture created an unusual and exotic environment to surround the visitor.\n\nBuilt examples of expressionist theatres include Henry van de Velde's construction of the model theatre for the 1914 Werkbund Exhibition, and Hans Poelzig's grand remodelling of the Grosses Schauspielhaus. The enormous capacity of the Grosses Schauspielhaus enabled low ticket prices, and the creation of a \"people's theatre\". Not only were expressionist architects building stages, Bruno Taut wrote a play intended for the theatre, \"Weltbaumeister\".\n\nExpressionist architects were both involved in film and inspired by it. Hans Poelzig strove to make films based on legends or fairy tales. Poelzig designed scenographic sets for Paul Wegener's 1920 film \"\". Space in \"Der Golem\" was a three-dimensional village, a lifelike rendering of the Jewish ghetto of Prague. This contrasts with the setting of the \"Cabinet of Doctor Caligari\", which was painted on canvas backdrops. Perhaps the latter was able to achieve more stylistic freedom, but Poelzig in \"Der Golem\" was able to create a whole village that \"spoke with a Jewish accent.\"\n\nHerman Finsterlin approached Fritz Lang with an idea for a film. Fritz Lang's film Metropolis demonstrates a visually progressive 'Futurist' society dealing with relevant issues of 1920s Germany in relation to labour and society. Bruno Taut designed an unbuilt theatre for reclining cinema-goers. Bruno Taut also proposed a film as an anthology for the Glass Chain, entitled \"Die Galoschen des Glücks\"(The Galoshes of Fortune) with a name borrowed from Hans Christian Andersen. On the film, Taut noted, \"an expressionism of the most subtle kind will bring surroundings, props and action into harmony with one another\". It featured architectural fantasias suited to each member of the Chain. Ultimately unproduced, it reveals the aspiration that the new medium, film, invoked.\n\nThe tendency towards abstraction in art corresponded with abstraction in architecture. Publication of \"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\" in 1912 by Wassily Kandinsky, his first advocacy of abstraction while still involved in Der Blaue Reiter phaze, marks a beginning of abstraction in expressionism and abstraction in expressionist architecture. The conception of the Einstein Tower by Erich Mendelson was not far behind Kandinsky, in advancing abstraction in architecture. By the publication of Kandinsky's \"Point and Line to Plane\" in 1926 a rigorous and more geometric form of abstraction emerged, and Kandinsky's work took on clearer and drafted lines. The trends in architecture are not dissimilar, as the Bauhaus was gaining attention and expressionist architecture was giving way to the geometric abstractions of modern architecture.\n\nThe term Brick Expressionism () describes a specific variant of expressionism that uses bricks, tiles or clinker bricks as the main visible building material. Buildings in the style were erected mostly in the 1920s. The style's regional centres were the larger cities of Northern Germany and the Ruhr area, but the Amsterdam School belongs to the same category.\n\nAmsterdam's 1912 cooperative-commercial Scheepvaarthuis (Shipping House) is considered the starting point and prototype for Amsterdam School work: brick construction with complicated masonry, traditional massing, and the integration of an elaborate scheme of building elements (decorative masonry, art glass, wrought-iron work, and exterior figurative sculpture) that embodies and expresses the identity of the building. The School flourished until about 1925.\n\nThe great international fame of German Expressionism is not related to the German Brick Expressionist architects, but to the German Expressionist painters of the two groups \"Die Brücke\" in Dresden since 1905 (Kirchner, Schmidt-Rottluff, Heckel, Nolde...) and \"Der Blaue Reiter\" in Munich since 1912 (Kandinsky, Marc, Macke, Münter, Jawlensky...).\n\nThe legacy of expressionist architecture extended to later movements in the twentieth century. It had an influence on its immediate successor, modern architecture, as well as Art Deco. The new objectivity (\"Neue Sachlichkeit\") art movement arose in direct opposition to expressionism. Expressionistic architecture today is an evident influence in deconstructivism, the work of Santiago Calatrava, and the organic movement of blobitecture.\n\nAnother movement that grew out of expressionism to become a school in its own right is Metaphoric architecture which includes elements of biomorphism and Zoomorphic architecture. The style is very much influenced by the form and geometry of the natural world and is characterised by the use of analogy and metaphor as the primary inspiration and directive for design.\nPerhaps the most prominent voice of the Metaphoric architectural school at present is Dr. Basil Al Bayati whose designs have been inspired by trees and plants, snails, whales, insects, dervishes and even myth and literature.\nHe is also the founder of the International School of Metaphoric Architecture in Málaga, Spain.\n\nMany of the founders and significant players in expressionist architecture were also important in modern architecture. Examples are Bruno Taut, Hans Scharoun, Walter Gropius, and Mies Van der Rohe. By 1927 Gropius, Taut, Scharoun and Mies were all building in the international style and participated in the Weissenhof Estate. Gropius and Mies are better known for their modernist work, but Gropius' Monument to the March Dead, and Mies' Friedrichstrasse office building projects are basic works of expressionist architecture. Le Corbusier started his career in modern architecture but took a turn for a more expressionist manner later in life.\n\nFirst identified at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in 1925, art deco shares some characteristics of expressionism and is likely to have been influenced directly by the Expressionist movement – particularly the activities of the Weimar Bauhaus – and more generally with the factors and politics that influenced both movements at the time, such as socialism and mechanisation. In common with art nouveau and expressionism they are interested in decorative effects that break with the past and reflect a new modernity. The bold use of zigzag and stepped forms, and sweeping curves and chevron patterns. New materials are employed in new ways such as glass, aluminum, and stainless steel. Later examples of Art Deco, particularly in New York City can be seen as a Transatlantic equivalent of European expressionism.\n\nThe influential architectural critic and historian, Sigfried Giedion in his book \"Space, Time and Architecture\" (1941) dismissed Expressionist architecture as a side show in the development of functionalism. In the middle of the twentieth century, in the 50s and 60s, many architects began designing in a manner reminiscent of expressionist architecture. In this post war period, a variant of expressionism brutalism had an honest approach to materials, that in its unadorned use of concrete, was similar to the use of brick by the Amsterdam School. The designs of Le Corbusier took a turn for the expressionist in his brutalist phase, but more so in his Notre Dame du Haut. In Mexico, in 1953, German émigré Mathias Goeritz, published the \"Arquitectura Emocional\" (Emotional architecture) manifesto where he declared that \"architecture's principal function is emotion.\" Modern Mexican architect Luis Barragán adopted the term that influenced his work. The two of them collaborated in the project Torres de Satélite (1957–58) guided by Goeritz's principles of Arquitectura Emocional. Another mid-century modern architect to evoke expressionism was Eero Saarinen. A similar aesthetic can be found in later buildings such as Eero Saarinen's 1962 TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport. His TWA Terminal at JFK International Airport has an organic form, as close to Herman Finsterlin's \"Formspiels\" as any other, save Jørn Utzon's Sydney Opera House. It was only in the 1970s that expressionism in architecture came to be re-evaluated in a more positive light. More recently still, the aesthetics and tactility of expressionist architecture have found echo in the works of Enric Miralles, most notability his Scottish Parliament building, deconstructivist architects such as Zaha Hadid and Daniel Libeskind, as well as Canadian Aboriginal architect Douglas Cardinal.\n\n\n1905\n\n1907\n\n1909 \n\n\n1911\n\n1912\n\n1913\n\n1914\n\n1915\n\n1917\n1918\n\n1919\n\n\n1921\n\n\n1922\n\n1923\n\n1924\n\n\n1925\n\n\n1926\n\n1927\n\n1928\n\n1931\n1938\n1937\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The flag appeared then again in 1932 and in the media where one of its creators described it as red, white and green with a sun in the middle. A similar flag was later used by the Soviet-backed Kurdish Republic known as the Republic of Mahabad in 1946.\n\nThe flag appeared in Kurdish media throughout the 90's with MED TV, Kurdsat, Kurdistan TV and their affiliates broadcasting with the flag appearing frequently in their programming allowing it to become a symbol of Kurdish statehood. A document dealing with the adaptation to international flag standards of the National Flag of Kurdistan was prepared by Mehrdad Izady and Bijhan Eliasi in 1998. It was instantly adopted by the international Flag Institute. In 1999, the Parliament of the Kurdish Regional Government adopted the standardized flag to be the official and standard presentation of the Kurdish National Flag in all its aspects.\n\nEstablished by the Kurdistan parliament in 1999, Kurdish Flag Day is celebrated on December 17.

{"id": "2282712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282712", "title": "George Sphrantzes", "text": "George Sphrantzes\n\nGeorge Sphrantzes, also Phrantzes or Phrantza ( or Φραντζής; 1401 – c. 1478), was a late Byzantine Greek historian and Imperial courtier. He was an attendant to Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, \"protovestiarites\" (\"Lord of the Imperial Wardrobe\") under John VIII Palaiologos, and a close confidant to Constantine XI Palaiologos. He was an eyewitness of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, made a slave by the victorious Turks, but ransomed shortly afterwards. Sphrantzes served the surviving members of the Palaiologian family for the next several years until taking monastic vows in 1472. It was while a monk he wrote his history, which ends with the notice of Sultan Mehmed II's attempt to capture Naupaktos, which he dates to the summer of 1477; Sphrantzes is assumed to have died not long after that event.\n\nHe was born in Constantinople, during the Turkish blockade of that city; his godmother was the nun Thomais. In 1418 he was appointed attendant to Emperor Manuel. During his service to the Emperor Manuel, Sphrantzes did many favors for Constantine, developing a strong rapport with the future Emperor for, as he writes, \"my uncle had been his tutor and my cousins and I were his companions, friends, and attendants.\" After the death of Manuel, he became the servant of Constantine and left with him 26 December 1427 when Constantine was appointed Despot of the Morea. \n\nWhen they arrived in the Morea, Constantine made him governor of Glarentza, and Sphrantzes assisted Constantine in the latter's efforts to conquer the remainder of the Morea, but was captured 26 March 1429 in a skirmish outside of Patras and held prisoner until his relationship to Constantine was recognized, and he was paroled back to the Byzantine side to negotiate surrender of the citadel. While traveling to Epirus as an ambassador, to help arbitrate a peace between Carlo II Tocco and his uncle's illegitimate sons over the succession to rule over Epirus, he was kidnapped by Catalan pirates, along with his retinue, and held at Cephalonia until the pirates took the group back to Glarentza where they were ransomed. Upon returning to Constantinople, he was made \"protovestiarites\" and appointed ambassador by the Emperor.\n\nAfter this point, Sphrantzes was a key supporter of Constantine. He attempted to secure Athens for his master in 1435; he negotiated Constantine's second marriage with Caterina Gattilusio in 1440; he was appointed prefect of Mistras in 1446; and most importantly he was sent on an embassy to Georgia and the Empire of Trebizond in search of a third wife for Emperor Constantine. During these duties he married Helena, the daughter of the imperial secretary Alexios Palaiologos Tzamplakon, and the Emperor Constantine was his best man. He was preparing to take his son John (and the larger part of his portable wealth) to the Morea, then to Cyprus, traveling by land \"so that my son could visit the places and learn all those things which would be of use in his life\" when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II began his siege of Constantinople.\n\nDespite being involved in the defense of the city, George Sphrantzes' account of the siege and capture of Constantinople in 1453 lacks much detail. About the death of Emperor Constantine, he writes simply, \"in this capture my late master and emperor, Lord Constantine, was killed. I was not at his side at that hour but had been inspecting another part of the City, according to his orders.\" Sphrantzes was captured and made a slave, but was ransomed 1 September 1453 then made his way to Mistras. There he obtained protection at the court of Thomas Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea. He managed to go to Adrianople in 1454, ransom his wife, and return to the Morea, while evading the Sultan Mehmed. He served as an ambassador to Venice on behalf of Thomas Palaiologos in 1455. After the downfall of the Peloponnesian Despotate (1460) Sphrantzes retired to the monastery of Tarchaneiotes in Corfu.\n\nBy Helena, he had five children, of whom two sons died in infancy, a third son Alexios died at the age of 5, while John and his only daughter Thamar lived to adulthood; the Emperor Constantine was godfather to both John and Thamar. Following the capture of Constantinople both children had become slaves of some elderly Turks, along with his wife Helena, who treated them well, and then were sold to the Sultan's Mir Ahor, or Master of Horse. However, before Sphrantzes could ransom them from the Mir Ahor, the Sultan learned of them and bought them. \"Thus there wretched mother was left all alone in the company of a single nurse,\" Sphrantzes writes. Sphrantzes records he learned of his son's death, at the age of 14 years and a day short of eight months, December 1453. Much later did Sphrantzes learn of his daughter Thamar's death in the Imperial Harem September 1455, aged 14 years and five months.\n\nAt the monastery he wrote his \"Chronicle\" (Χρονικόν), which, like most Byzantine chronicles, begins with the creation of the world but is more detailed when talking of the history of the House of the Palaiologoi from 1258 to 1476. It is a very valuable authority for the events of his own times. The distinctive traits of his work are loyalty to the Palaiologoi -- Sphrantzes often exaggerated their merits and suppressed their defects -- hatred of the Turks, and devotion to Orthodoxy. Steven Runciman described his work as \"honest, vivid and convincing\" and that Sphrantzes \"wrote good Greek in an easy unpretentious style.\"\n\nThere are editions by I. Bekker (1838) in the \"Corpus scriptorum hist. byz.\", and in J. P. Migne, \"Patrologia graeca, civi\". The most recent critical edition of Sphrantzes is by Vasile Grecu (Bucharest, 1966), which appeared with a Romanian translation. Sphrantzes was also translated into German in 1954, and into English by Marios Philippides (Amherst, 1980). There is an edition with Italian translation by R. Maisano, Rome 1990 (CFHB 29).\n\nFor centuries it was believed that Sphrantzes wrote two works, one the \"Minor Chronicle\" and the other the \"Major Chronicle\". The \"Major Chronicle\" is more detailed particularly about the siege of Constantinople. But, beginning in 1934, the research of such scholars as J.B. Falier-Papadopoulos, Franz Dölger, and Raymond-Joseph Loenertz demonstrated that the \"Major Chronicle\" was written decades later by Makarios Melissenos (\"Pseudo-Sphrantzes\"), a priest who fled to Naples from a Greek-Venetian island conquered by the Ottomans. Why Melissenos selected Sphrantzes to elaborate and expand upon is not clear.\n\n\n"}

It was contrived to demonstrate a long standing association with the Church. As such \"maol\" is often described as meaning bald and then quickly followed by the idea of a monks shaved head. While \"maol\" does mean bald it also can mean thin. However, in both cases it is used in reference with the landscape; bald might mean lacking in trees, and thin might mean a peninsula or island. It defines a feature of the landscape that is associated with the family. The use of maol, in a family name, is found recorded some 200 years before Maol Eoin was born. Maolrunaigh (Mulrooney)was a past family name that was passed down, mostly in part, through the generations. This was a common way to include the name of the bride's father, as a mark of respect. If Maol Eoin means devotee of St John, then it would stand to reason that Maolrunaigh must be a devotee of St. Rooney. However, a St. Rooney does nor exist.\n\nThe Ó Maoil Eoin were wrongly accorded kinship with the Uí Briúin, based on the statement that \"Maoliosa {son of Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair}, Bishop of Roscommon, who had a son named Maol Eoin ... a quo O'Maoil Eoin, anglicised Malone.\" However, the family were already in existence before Tairrdelbach was born, so the kinship is mistaken, or possibly a forgery, though at least one very old family tradition holds the name was intended to signify a friendship or political alliance at the time of baptism.\n\nThey seemed to have been an ecclesiastical or Erenagh family native to the area, with no links to any great royal houses.\n\nGilla Críst is the earliest known member of the family associated with Clonmacnoise, and perhaps the ancestor of all subsequent Ó Maoil Eoin's associated with it.\n\nHe was associated with Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair, as attested in an entry in Chronicon Scotorum \"sub anno\" 1124 - \"The great bell-tower of Cluaín moccu Nóis was completed by Gilla Críst ua Maíleoin and Tairdelbach ua Conchobuir.\"\n\nTwo years later the same text records that \"Gilla Críst ua Maíleoin, abbot of Cluaín moccu Nóis, the fount of wisdom and charity, the head of wealth and riches of Ireland, rested.\"\n\n\"Chronicon Scotorum\" is an account of Irish affairs that ends in an unfinished manner in the entry dated 1150.

His influence on historical developments on Europe has been the subject a numerous assessments. Some of the subjects that has been assessed are Metternich's over-all diplomatic skills and actual degree of influence, his role in shaping the balance of power in Europe, and his opposition to nationalist and liberal movements. Historians agree on Metternich's skill as a diplomat and his dedication to conservatism. According to Arthur May, he believed that:\n\nFor over two centuries, historians have disagreed on Metternich. Professor Enno Kraehe assembled excerpts from 17 experts, and tagged each one:\n\nParticularly in the 19th century, Metternich was heavily criticised as the man who prevented Austria and the rest of central Europe from \"developing along 'normal' liberal and constitutional lines\". If Metternich had not stood in the way of (in their view) progress, Austria might have reformed, dealt with the problems of nationality better, and the First World War may never have happened. Instead, Metternich fought bitterly against the forces of liberalism and nationalism, but achieved only a temporary reprieve. Indeed, Robin Okey, a critic of Metternich, suggests that the social conservatism Metternich advocated may have actually been counter-productive when it came to keeping a lid on nationalist sentiment Moreover, in pursuit of this unachievable goal, Metternich was happy to sacrifice freedom of speech: heavy censorship was just one of many repressive instruments of state available to him that also including a large spy network. Though he did not introduce the bodies, he gave them their \"demoralising aspect of permanence\" during his long tenure as chancellor. He also opposed electoral reform, heavily criticising the British Reform Bill introduced in 1830. A more enlightened chancellor would have realised he was involved in a battle with \"the prevailing mood of his age\". Instead of his zero tolerance approach, critics maintain that would have done better to have turned the current in a favourable direction; for example, the Austrian historian Viktor Bibl described Metternich as \"the demon of Austria\" for letting Prussia and not Austria unify Germany through his determination that Germany should not unify at all. Likewise, Metternich has been accused of excessive vanity to the point of complacency, and therefore someone ill-suited to the evolution of constitutional principles.\n\nThis view presupposes that Metternich had the ability to favourably shape Europe, but chose not to. More modern critiques, such as that included in the work of A. J. P. Taylor, have questioned just how much influence Metternich really had. Okey noted that even in the realm of foreign affairs Metternich \"had only his own persuasiveness to rely on\", and this degraded over time. On this reading, he stuck doggedly to a set of \"cumbersome\" conservative principles that he was forced to articulate in long and detailed memoranda: a \"smokescreen\" that hid Austria's true weakness. When it came to choosing a set of sound principles, wrote Taylor, \"most men could do better while shaving\". The result was that Metternich was no captivating diplomatic force: Taylor described him as \"the most boring man in European history\"; Metternich himself boasted he could \"bore men to death\". This view also highlights Metternich's abject failure to live up to his hype as the \"coachman of Europe\": Austria did not defeat Napoleon; Austria did not dictate the peace of Vienna; Austria could not stop France invading Spain, Britain settling the borders of Belgium or Russia deciding the fate of Turkey in 1833. Not only were his failures limited to foreign affairs, critics argue: at home he was equally powerless, failing to push through even his own proposals for administrative reform. On this basis it is argued that Metternich was essentially irrelevant both home and abroad.\n\nOn the other hand, Metternich's credentials as a diplomat and statesman were the focus of praise in the twentieth century from more favourable historians, particularly biographer Heinrich von Srbik. For example, particularly after the Second World War, historians were more likely to defend Metternich's policies as reasonable attempts to achieve his own goals i.e. the defence of the balance of power in Europe and the preservation of the \"status quo\" in the face of the revolutionary challenge. Even if the sort of international conspiracy Metternich imagined never existed, the Napoleonic era was a time of change which left a conservative like Metternich with few options. More sympathetic historians highlight that Metternich correctly foresaw and worked to prevent Russian dominance in Europe, succeeding where his successors would fail 130 years later. If there was a partition in Europe between conservatives and liberals, they contend that some blame must lie with the liberals such as Canning and Palmerston for their failure to compromise as Lord Castlereagh had in 1815. As argued by Srbik, Metternich himself pursued legality, cooperation and dialogue, and therefore helped ensure 30 years of peace, the \"Age of Metternich\". In the works of authors such as Peter Viereck and Ernst B. Haas, Metternich also gains credit for many of his more liberal ideals, even if they did not come to much; indeed, Metternich's lack of influence at court is now used to shield him from the harshest criticisms of inactivity. They argue that Metternich commendably pushed for an embryonic parliament and equal rights for the constituent states of the Empire at home, and abroad argued for equality before the law, modern bureaucracies, and fair levels of taxation. In 1847, Metternich himself denied that the Austrian Empire was anything but liberal. In this light, Metternich's methods have been seen as paternalistic, protecting Austrians from real dangers outside their borders.\n\nThose who have attempted to rehabilitate Metternich likewise contend that, along with contemporaries Viscount Castlereagh and Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand, Metternich \"unquestionably [a] master of diplomacy\", someone who \"perfected\" and indeed shaped the nature of diplomacy in his era. For them, Metternich was \"handsome, witty... [and] tenacious\", by his own admission \"bad at skirmishes... but good at campaigns\". Likewise, Henry Kissinger's PhD dissertation about Metternich, later published in 1957, praised Metternich's role in holding together the crumbling Austrian Empire, though Kissinger's work has generated controversy in academic circles among such historians as Paul W. Schroeder, \"inter alia\" attracting criticism for the absence of footnotes. Certainly, if he was a good diplomat he certainly attracted a great deal of contemporary criticism for lying; fellow diplomats Canning and Talleyrand both commented on it, whilst the poet Franz Grillparzer suggested that Metternich came to believe his own lies. Even so, as critical historian Alan Sked argues, Metternich's \"smokescreen\" served a purpose in furthering a relative coherent set of principles, though it came at the expense of being in control of individual events. However, Sked is quick to also point out that Metternich's apparent liberalism, as put forward by Viereck and Haas, did not amount to wanting decentralisation, and as such the old concerns that Metternich pushed for a (now outmoded) heavily centralised autocratic system cannot be dismissed. Sked does, however, warn against the use of hindsight, arguing that Metternich's actions were, at the time, entirely in keeping with Austrian politics, and that the events of 1848 were a mere blip when Austria lost its nerve.\n\nJulius Evola, described as \"one of the most influential fascist racists in Italian history, author of \"Revolt Against the Modern World\", saw Metternich as a conservative ideal.\n\n"}

{"id": "144589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144589", "title": "Information warfare", "text": "Information warfare\n\nInformation warfare (IW) is a concept involving the battlespace use and management of information and communication technology (ICT) in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent. Information warfare is the manipulation of information trusted by a target without the target's awareness, so that the target will make decisions against their interest but in the interest of the one conducting information warfare. As a result, it is not clear when information warfare begins, ends, and how strong or destructive it is. Information warfare may involve collection of tactical information, assurance(s) that one's own information is valid, spreading of propaganda or disinformation to demoralize or manipulate the enemy and the public, undermining the quality of opposing force information and denial of information-collection opportunities to opposing forces. Information warfare is closely linked to psychological warfare.\n\nThe United States military focus tends to favor technology, and hence tends to extend into the realms of electronic warfare, cyberwarfare, information assurance and computer network operations, attack and defense.\n\nMost of the rest of the world use the much broader term of \"Information Operations\" which, although making use of technology, focuses on the more human-related aspects of information use, including (amongst many others) social network analysis, decision analysis and the human aspects of command and control.\n\nInformation warfare can take many forms:\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has had Information Warfare Squadrons since the 1980s. In fact, the official mission of the U.S. Air Force is now \"To fly, fight and win...in air, space and cyberspace\", with the latter referring to its information warfare role.\n\nAs the U.S. Air Force often risks aircraft and aircrews to attack strategic enemy communications targets, remotely disabling such targets using software and other means can provide a safer alternative. In addition, disabling such networks electronically (instead of explosively) also allows them to be quickly re-enabled after the enemy territory is occupied. Similarly, counter-information warfare units are employed to deny such capability to the enemy. The first application of these techniques was used against Iraqi communications networks in the Gulf War.\n\nAlso during the Gulf War, Dutch hackers allegedly stole information about U.S. troop movements from U.S. Defense Department computers and tried to sell it to the Iraqis, who thought it was a hoax and turned it down. In January 1999, U.S. Air Intelligence computers were hit by a co-ordinated attack (Moonlight Maze), part of which came from a Russian mainframe. This could not be confirmed as a Russian cyber attack due to non-attribution – the principle that online identity may not serve as proof of real world identity.\n\nInformation warfare is fundamentally not about information technologies (IT). It is about people, both those in military and civil society, both the supporters and opponents.\n\nThe innovation of more advanced and autonomous ICTs has engendered a new revolution in military affairs, which encompasses nations' use of ICTs in both cyberspace and the physical battlefield to wage war against their adversaries. The three most prevalent revolutions in military affairs come in the form of cyberattacks, autonomous robots and communication management.\n\nWithin the realm of cyberspace, there are two primary weapons: network-centric warfare and C4ISR, which denotes integrated Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Furthermore, cyberspace attacks initiated by one nation against another nation have an underlying goal of gaining information superiority over the attacked party, which includes disrupting or denying the victimized party’s ability to gather and distribute information. A real-world occurrence that illustrated the dangerous potential of cyberattacks transpired in 2007, when a strike from Israeli forces demolished an alleged nuclear reactor in Syria that was being constructed via a collaborative effort between Syria and North Korea. Accompanied with the strike was a cyberattack on Syria's air defenses, which left them blind to the attack on the nuclear reactor and, ultimately allowed for the attack to occur (New York Times 2014). An example of a more basic attack on a nation within cyberspace is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack, which is utilized to hinder networks or websites until they lose their primary functionality. As implied, cyberattacks do not just affect the military party being attacked, but rather the whole population of the victimized nation. Since more aspects of daily life are being integrated into networks in cyberspace, civilian populations can potentially be negatively affected during wartime. For example, if a nation chose to attack another nation’s power grid servers in a specific area to disrupt communications, civilians and businesses in that area would also have to deal with power outages, which could potentially lead to economic disruptions as well.\n\nMoreover, physical ICTs have also been implemented into the latest revolution in military affairs by deploying new, more autonomous robots (i.e. – unmanned drones) into the battlefield to carry out duties such as patrolling borders and attacking ground targets. Humans from remote locations pilot many of the unmanned drones, however, some of the more advanced robots, such as the Northrop Grumman X-47B, are capable of autonomous decisions. Despite piloting the drones from remote locations, a proportion of drone pilots still suffer from stress factors of more traditional warfare. According to NPR, a study performed by the Pentagon in 2011 found that 29% of drone pilots are “burned out” and undergo high levels of stress. Furthermore, approximately 17% of the drone pilots surveyed as the study were labeled “clinically distressed” with some of those pilots also showing signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nModern ICTs have also brought advancements to communications management among military forces. Communication is a vital aspect of war for any involved party and, through the implementation of new ICTs such as data-enabled devices, military forces are now able to disseminate information faster than ever before. For example, some militaries are now employing the use of iPhones to upload data and information gathered by drones in the same area.\n\nWhile information warfare has yielded many advances in the types of attack that a government can make, it has also raised concerns about the moral and legal ambiguities surrounding this particularly new form of war. Traditionally, wars have been analyzed by moral scholars according to Just War Theory. However, with Information Warfare, Just War Theory fails because the theory is based on the traditional conception of war. Information Warfare has three main issues surrounding it compared to traditional warfare:\n\n\nRecently, legal concerns have arisen centered on these issues, specifically the issue of the right to privacy in the United States of America. Lt. General Keith B. Alexander, who served as the head of Cyber Command under President Barack Obama, noted that there was a “mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies” when writing to the Senate Armed Services Committee. A key point of concern was the targeting of civilian institutions for cyberattacks, to which the general promised to try to maintain a mindset similar to that of traditional war, in which they will seek to limit the impact on civilians.\n\n\nGroup specific:\n\nUS specific:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He had a lifelong association with Victoria University College, which became Victoria University of Wellington, and after his death it named the archival collections after him.\n\nBeaglehole was born and grew up in Wellington, New Zealand, the second of the four sons of David Ernest Beaglehole, a clerk, and his wife, Jane Butler. His younger brother was Ernest Beaglehole, who became a psychologist and ethnologist. John was educated at Mount Cook School and Wellington College before being enrolled at Victoria University College, Wellington of the University of New Zealand, which later became an independent university, and where he subsequently spent most of his academic career. After his graduation, he was awarded a scholarship to study at the London School of Economics, and left for England in 1926.\n\nAfter three years of post-graduate study Beaglehole obtained his PhD with a thesis on British colonial history. At this time he was much influenced by left-wing teachers, especially R. H. Tawney and Harold Laski, and on returning to New Zealand he found it difficult to obtain an academic post owing to his radical views. For a time he had various jobs including a spell as a Workers Educational Association lecturer, and had time to develop other enthusiasms including civil rights issues, writing poetry, and music, an interest inherited from his mother. In 1932 he took a temporary position as a lecturer in history at Auckland University College, but within months the position was abolished in a retrenchment by the college council. Many believed the decision was due more to the college's reaction to Beaglehole's reputation (albeit exaggerated) for radicalism. His academic career finally took off in 1934 after the publication of his first major book, \"The Exploration of the Pacific\", after which he developed his specialist interest in James Cook. He became lecturer, later professor, at the Victoria University College.\n\nHe married Elsie Mary Holmes in 1930, and they had three sons.\n\nBeaglehole became known internationally for his work on Cook's journals which brought out his great gifts as historian and editor. It was not all desk work among the archives – he also travelled widely in Cook's wake, from Whitby to Tahiti, to Tonga and to the New Hebrides. The four volumes of the journals that emerged between 1955 and 1967 were subsidised by the New Zealand government which also set up a special research post for their author. The sheer size of these tomes, each of them approaching 1,000 pages, may seem disconcerting at first sight, but they are enlivened by Beaglehole's stylish and often witty introductions, intended to set the journals in their contexts. As well as Cook's own journals Beaglehole also printed, either entire or in lengthy extracts, the journals of several of Cook's colleagues on the voyages. The introductions themselves, together with copious footnotes, reveal the breadth of his erudition. They cover many topics, ranging from the structure of Polynesian society to oceanography, navigation, cartography, and much else.\n\nMuch of the zoological and botanical notes for Beaglehole's work on James Cook's three voyages were provided by Dr Averil Margaret Lysaght.\n\nCook's journals themselves had never before been comprehensively and accurately presented to the public, and to do so required enormous research since copies and fragments of the journals and related material were scattered in various archives in London, Australia and New Zealand. For his edition, Beaglehole sought out the various surviving holographs in Cook's own hand in preference to copies by his clerks on board ship, and others. For the first voyage, the voyage of the \"Endeavour\", he used mainly the manuscript journal held in the National Library of Australia at Canberra. This only came to light in 1923, when the heirs of a Teesside ironmaster, Henry Bolckow, put it up for sale. Bolckow had purchased this manuscript at an earlier auction, in 1868, but had not made his ownership widely known, and consequently it was assumed for many years that no such holograph existed. For the second voyage Beaglehole used two other partial journals in Cook's hand, both of which had the same early history as the \"Endeavour\" journal. All three had probably once been owned by Cook's widow, and sold by a relation of hers at the 1868 auction. The difference was that the two partial journals from the second voyage were then purchased by the British Museum and not by Bolckow, and hence had long been available for public consultation. And for the third voyage Beaglehole's main source was a journal written, and much revised, by Cook up to early January 1779, a month before he died. What happened to the final month's entries, which must certainly have been made, is uncertain. This, too, is today in the British Library, the successor to the British Museum as a manuscript repository.\n\nAll students of Cook owe an enormous debt to Beaglehole for his all-encompassing editorship. So much so, in fact, that today it is difficult to view the subject of Cook except through Beaglehole's perspective. Some recent biographies of Cook have tended to be little else than abbreviated versions of Beaglehole. Nevertheless, it is also clear that Beaglehole’s work is, by and large, a continuation of the long tradition of Cook idealisation, a tradition from which post-Beaglehole scholarship has started to diverge. For Beaglehole, Cook was a heroic figure who could do practically no wrong, and he is scathing about those contemporaries of Cook who ever ventured to criticise his hero, such as Alexander Dalrymple, the geographer, and Johann Reinhold Forster, who accompanied Cook on the second voyage. Recent research has to some extent rehabilitated both Dalrymple and Forster.\n\nDuring his last decade Beaglehole was showered with honorary degrees from universities at home and abroad and other distinctions. Perhaps the most prestigious was the award in 1970 of the British Order of Merit. He was only the second New Zealander ever to receive this award, the first being the nuclear physicist Ernest Rutherford. Just before he died in 1971 Beaglehole was in the process of revising his detailed and authoritative biography of Cook, which was subsequently prepared for publication by his son Tim, who was Chancellor and Emeritus Professor at Victoria.\n\nBeaglehole's \"alma mater\", the Victoria University of Wellington, named its archival collections after him, in the reading room of which is displayed his portrait, by W.A. Sutton. The J.C. Beaglehole Room, as it is known, was moved into a completely new space in 2011.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "634124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=634124", "title": "Leuchter report", "text": "Leuchter report\n\nThe Leuchter report is a pseudoscientific document authored by American execution technician Fred A. Leuchter, who was commissioned by Ernst Zündel to defend him at his trial in Canada for distributing Holocaust denial material. Leuchter compiled the report in 1988 with the intention of investigating the feasibility of mass homicidal gassings at Nazi extermination camps, specifically at Auschwitz. He travelled to the camp, collected multiple pieces of brick from the remains of the crematoria and gas chambers (without the camp's permission), brought them back to the United States, and submitted them for chemical analysis. At the trial, Leuchter was called upon to defend the report in the capacity of an expert witness; however during the trial, the court ruled that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such.\n\nLeuchter cited the absence of Prussian blue in the homicidal gas chambers to support his view that they could not have been used to gas people. However, residual iron-based cyanide compounds are not a categorical consequence of cyanide exposure. By not discriminating against that, Leuchter introduced an unreliable factor into his experiment, and his findings were seriously flawed as a result. In contrast, tests conducted by Polish forensic scientists (who discriminated against iron-based compounds) confirmed the presence of cyanide in the locations, in accordance with where and how it was used in the Holocaust. In addition, the report was criticized as Leuchter had overlooked critical evidence, such as documents in the SS architectural office which recorded the mechanical operation of the gas chambers and others which verified the rate at which the Nazis could burn the bodies of those gassed.\n\nIn 1985, Ernst Zündel, a German pamphleteer and publisher living in Canada, was put on trial for publishing Richard Verrall's Holocaust denial pamphlet \"Did Six Million Really Die?\", which was deemed to violate Canadian laws against distributing false news. Zündel was found guilty, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. This led to a second prosecution.\n\nZündel and his lawyers were joined by Robert Faurisson, a French academic of literature and Holocaust denier, who came to Toronto to advise the defence, having previously testified as expert witness at the first trial. He was joined by David Irving, an English writer and Holocaust denier, who was to assist the defence and testify on Zündel's behalf. Faurisson claimed that it was technically and physically impossible for the gas chambers at Auschwitz to have functioned as extermination facilities, based on comparisons with American execution gas chambers; he therefore suggested getting an American prison warden who had participated in executions by gas to testify. Irving and Faurisson therefore invited Bill Armontrout, warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary, who agreed to testify and suggested they contact Fred A. Leuchter, a Bostonian execution equipment designer. Faurisson reported that Leuchter initially accepted the mainstream account of the Holocaust, but after two days of discussion with him, he stated that Leuchter was convinced that homicidal gassings never occurred. After having met Zündel in Toronto and agreeing to serve as an expert witness for his defence, Leuchter travelled with them to spend a week in Poland. He was accompanied by his draftsman, a cinematographer supplied by Zündel, a translator fluent in German and Polish, and his wife. Although Zündel and Faurisson did not accompany them, Leuchter said that they were with them \"every step of the way\" in spirit.\n\nAfter arriving in Poland the group spent three days at the former Auschwitz concentration camp site, and another at the former Majdanek concentration camp. At these, they filmed Leuchter illicitly collecting what he regarded to be forensic quality samples of materialsfrom the wreckage of the former gas extermination facilities, while his wife and the translator acted as lookouts. Drawings of where the samples were taken from, the film footage of their physical collection and Leuchter's notebook detailing the work were surrendered to the trial court as evidence. Leuchter claimed that his conclusions were based on his expert knowledge of gas chamber operation, his visual inspection of what remained of the structures at Auschwitz, and original drawings and blueprints of some of the facilities. He said that the blueprints had been given to him by Auschwitz Museum officials.\n\nThe compiled report was published in Canada as \"The Leuchter Report: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek, Poland\", by Zündel's Samisdat Publications, and in England as \"Auschwitz: The End of the Line. The Leuchter Report: The First Forensic Examination of Auschwitz\" by Focal Point Publications, David Irving's publishing house. However, the court accepted the report only as evidentiary display and not as direct evidence; Leuchter was therefore required to explain it and testify to its veracity in the trial.\n\nBefore Leuchter could do this, he was examined by the court. He admitted that he was not a toxicologist and dismissed the need for having a degree in engineering:\n\nLeuchter admitted under oath that he only had a bachelor of arts degree and implicitly suggested that an engineering degree was unavailable to him by saying that his college did not offer an engineering degree during his studies. Boston University actually offered three different kinds of such qualification when he was a student there. When asked by the court if the B.A. he obtained was in a field that entitled him to operate as an engineer, he confirmed that this was so, even though his degree was in history. Similarly, Leuchter claimed that he obtained most of his research material on the camps (including original crematoria blueprints) from the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps' archives, and testified that these documents had a far more important role in shaping his conclusions than the physical samples he collected, yet after the trial the director of the Auschwitz museum denied that Leuchter had received any plans or blueprints from them.\n\nJudge Ronald Thomas began to label Leuchter's methodology as \"ridiculous\" and \"preposterous\", dismissing many of the report's conclusions on the basis that they were based on \"second-hand information\", and refused to allow him to testify on the effect of Zyklon B on humans because he had never worked with the substance, and was neither a toxicologist nor a chemist. Judge Thomas dismissed Leuchter's opinion because it was of \"no greater value than that of an ordinary tourist\", and in regards to Leuchter's opinion said:\n\nWhen questioned on the functioning of the crematoria, the judge also prevented Leuchter from testifying because \"he hasn't any expertise\". Leuchter also claimed that consultation relating to sodium cyanide and hydrogen cyanide with DuPont was \"an on-going thing\". DuPont, the largest American manufacturer of hydrogen cyanide, stated that it had \"never provided any information on cyanides to persons representing themselves as Holocaust deniers, including Fred Leuchter\", and had \"never provided any information regarding the use of cyanide at Auschwitz, Birkenau or Majdanek.\"\n\nThe contents of the report, in particular Leuchter's methodology, are heavily criticised. James Roth, the manager of the lab that carried out the analysis on the samples Leuchter collected, swore under oath to the results at the trial. Roth did not learn what the trial was about until he got off the stand. He later stated that cyanide would have only penetrated to a depth of around 10 micrometres, a tenth of the thickness of a human hair. The samples of brick, mortar and concrete that Leuchter took were of indeterminate thickness: not being aware of this, the lab ground the samples to a fine powder which thus severely diluted the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample. A more accurate analysis would have been obtained by analysing the surface of the samples Leuchter collected. Roth offered the analogy that the investigation was like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber behind it.\n\nLeuchter's opposition to the possibility of homicidal gassings at Auschwitz relies on residual cyanide remains found in the homicidal gas chambers and delousing chambers at Auschwitz. While both facilities were exposed to the same substance (Zyklon B), many of the delousing chambers are stained with an iron based compound known as Prussian blue, which is not apparent in the homicidal gas chambers. It is not only this disparity that Leuchter cites, but accordingly from his samples (which included measurements of it) that he claims he measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the gas chambers, which he argues is inconsistent between the amounts necessary to kill human beings and lice. This argument is often cited by Holocaust deniers, and similar claims are also made by Germar Rudolf.\n\nAccording to Richard J. Green:\n\nIn other words, Green states that Leuchter failed to show that Prussian Blue would have been produced in the homicidal gas chambers in the first place—meaning its absence is not in itself proof that no homicidal gassings took place.\nThe problem with Prussian blue is that it is by no means a categorical sign of cyanide exposure. One factor necessary in its formation is a very high concentration of cyanide. In terms of the difference between amounts measured in the delousing chambers and homicidal gas chambers, critics explain that the exact opposite of what deniers claim is true. Insects have a far higher resistance to cyanide than humans, with concentration levels up to 16,000ppm (parts per million) and an exposure time of more than 20 hours (sometimes as long as 72 hours) being necessary for them to succumb. In contrast, a cyanide concentration of only 300ppm is fatal to humans in a matter of minutes. This difference is one of the reasons behind the concentration disparity. Another exceedingly sensitive factor by which very small deviances could determine whether Prussian blue may form is pH. pH could be affected by the presence of human beings. Also, while the delousing chambers were left intact, the ruins of the crematoria at Birkenau had been exposed to the elements for over forty years by the time Leuchter collected his samples. This would have severely affected his results, because unlike Prussian blue and other iron based cyanides, cyanide salts are highly soluble in water.\n\nSince the formation of Prussian blue is not an unconditional outcome of exposure to cyanide, it is not a reliable indicator. Leuchter and Rudolf claim to have measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the homicidal gas chambers, but since they did not discriminate against an unreliable factor, Green maintains that instant bias is introduced into their experiments. Similarly, Rudolf acknowledges that Prussian blue does not always form upon exposure to cyanide and is thus not a reliable marker, yet continues to include the iron compounds in his analysis. Green describe this as \"disingenuous\". Since a building that contains Prussian blue staining would exhibit much higher levels of detectable cyanides than one without any, Green writes that Leuchter's and Rudolf's measurements reveal nothing more than what is already visible to the naked eye.\n\nIn February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, director of The Institute for Forensic Research (IFRC) in Kraków conducted a fair experiment where iron compounds were excluded. Given that the ruins of the gas chambers at Birkenau have been washed by a column of water at least 35m in height based on climatological records since 1945, Markiewicz and his team were not optimistic at being able to detect cyanides so many years later; nevertheless, having the legal permission to obtain samples, they collected some from areas as sheltered from the elements as possible.\n\nLeuchter's report stated that the small amounts of cyanide he detected in the ruins of the crematoria are merely the result of fumigation. However the IFRC points out that the control samples they took from living areas which may have been fumigated only once as part of the 1942 typhus epidemic tested negative for cyanide, and that the typhus epidemic occurred before the crematoria at Birkenau even existed.\nAccordingly, the IFRC demonstrated that cyanides were present in all of the facilities where it is claimed that they were exposed, i.e. all five crematoria, the cellars of Block 11 and the delousing facilities. Critics state that any attempt to demonstrate that the crematoria could not have functioned as homicidal gas chambers on the basis that they were not exposed to cyanide is unsuccessful, given that its presence in what remains of these facilities is incontrovertible, and write that all of the gas chambers were exposed to cyanide at levels higher than background levels elsewhere in the camp, such as living areas, where no cyanides at all were detected. In addition, tests conducted at Auschwitz in 1945 revealed the presence of cyanides on ventilation grilles found in the ruins of Crematorium II (thus also demonstrating that the Leuchter report was not the first forensic examination of the camp as purported in the title of the London edition). The historian Richard J. Evans argued that due to Leuchter's ignorance of the large disparity between the amounts of cyanide necessary to kill humans and lice, instead of disproving the homicidal use of gas chambers, the small amounts of cyanide which Leuchter detected actually tended to confirm it.\n\nBy order of Heinrich Himmler, the crematoria and gas chambers at Birkenau were destroyed by the SS in order to hide evidence of genocide. Nothing more than the bases of Crematoria IV and V can be seen: the floor plans of both facilities are indicated by bricks laid out across the concrete foundations, and Crematoria II and III are in ruins. Professor Robert Jan van Pelt labels Leuchter's comment that the facilities have not changed at all since 1942 or 1941 as \"nonsense\".\n\nBecause hydrogen cyanide is explosive, Leuchter maintained that the gas chambers could never have been operated due to their proximity to the ovens of the crematoria. It is correct that hydrogen cyanide is explosive, but only at concentrations of 56,000 ppm and above – over 186 times more than the lethal dose of 300 ppm. Critics estimate conservatively that within 5 to 15 minutes, gas chamber victims were exposed to 450 – 1810 ppmv – again considerably lower than the lower explosion limit.\n\nLeuchter incorrectly assumed that the gas chambers were not ventilated. The basement gas chambers of Crematoria II and III were mechanically ventilated via motors in the roof space of the main crematorium structure capable of extracting the remaining gas and renewing the air every three to four minutes.\n\nWhen ventilation was not used such as in Crematoria IV and V (although a ventilation system was later installed in Crematorium V in May 1944), Sonderkommando prisoners wore gas masks when removing the bodies. When presented in court with a document by the chief Auschwitz architect SS-\"Sturmbannführer\" Karl Bischoff, Leuchter misconstrued aeration (\"Belüftung\") and ventilation (\"Entlüftung\") as part of the furnace blower systems, when they were actually in reference to the ventilation channels in the walls that straddle the gas chambers. These are visible on blueprints, and can still partly be seen in the ruined east wall of the Crematorium III gas chamber.\n\nLeuchter was also prepared to act as expert witness regarding crematoria ovens despite admitting during cross examination that he had no expert knowledge. Leuchter presented his own estimate of 156 corpses as the total daily incineration capacity of the installations at Auschwitz. During cross-examination, he was presented with a letter written by the Auschwitz Central Construction Office (\"Auschwitz Zentralbauleitung\") of June 28, 1943, from SS-\"Sturmbannführer\" Jahrling to SS-\"Brigadeführer\" Hans Kammler stating that the five crematoria installations had a collective daily capacity of 4,756 corpses. Leuchter conceded that this was quite different from his own figure, and that he had never seen the document in question before.\n\nA patent application by the makers of the ovens, (both of which were made during the war) and two independent testimonies confirmed the capacity of the crematoria. Because the 4,756 figure is evidence of the Nazis equipping a camp of a maximum of 125,000 prisoners with the facility to cremate 140,000 of them per month, critics of Leuchter explain that this reveals the true exterminationist purpose of Auschwitz: a camp with the capacity to reduce its entire population to ash on a monthly basis was not merely a benign internment camp.\n\nAt various times (such as in the summer of 1944 when the crematoria couldn't keep up with the extermination rate), bodies were burnt in open-air pits. Accordingly, the capacity of the crematoria was never a limiting factor, and the pits yielded practically no limit to the number of corpses that could be burnt.\n\n\n\n"}

He frequently wrote in Spanish.\n\nHe was born of an ancient Portuguese noble family, probably at Pombeiro, studied in Braga for some years, and when about fourteen entered the service of the Bishop of Porto. With the exception of about four years, from 1631 to 1634, during which he was a member of the Portuguese embassy in Rome, the greater part of his later life was spent at Madrid, and there he died in June 1649.\n\nHe was married to Catarina Machado, the \"Albania\" of his poems, enabled him to lead a studious domestic life, dividing his cares and affections between his children and his books.

Created by writer Alfredo Castelli and artist Giancarlo Alessandrini, it was first published in Italy by Sergio Bonelli Editore in 1982.\n\nDark Horse Comics has published the English version of the series in the United States. It is still published in Italy and has been translated in many other languages, sometimes with the name changed (\"e.g.\", in Germany, the series is named \"Alan Dark\"; in the United States, \"Martin Mystery\"/\"Martin Mystère\"; in Serbia, \"Marti Misterija\", in Croatia, \"Martin Mystère\"; in Turkey, \"Atlantis\", and in Tamil Nadu, \"Marma Manithan Martin\").\n\nThe series is one of Bonelli's most popular comic book in Italy, selling over 20,000 copies each month. It has been adapted to various other media, such as an animated television series, video games, and books.\n\nMartin Mystère is an art historian, archaeologist, anthropologist, adventurer, writer, television producer, and collector of unusual objects. Based in New York City, where he was born Martin Jacques Mystère, he spent much of his early life studying in Italy, where many of his adventures take place. After the unexplained deaths of his parents in a plane crash (1965), he started to devote his studies to the most enigmatic events and places of human history. He also helps the New York police and a United States secret government agency in their investigations, as well as anyone who comes to him for help and gets him curious. He is assisted in his adventures all around the world by Java, a mute and very strong Neanderthal man he discovered in the hidden City of Lucid Shadows in Mongolia.\n\nJava is Martin's closest friend and helper. He is a Neanderthal man found in a lost city of Neanderthals. He adapted to modern life. In the early series, he mostly followed or found people or things with his instinct or animallike sense of smell; later, he became more normal but lost effect on the stories. Now he mostly follows Martin everywhere, protects and helps him.\n\nMartin Mystère's main opponents include the Men in Black, the controversial art patron Sergej Orloff, and Mr. Jinx.\n\nTwo other antagonists of the series are Loki and Morgan Le Fay.\n\nHis companion is Diana Lombard, who is also his long-time fiancée, later his wife. Mystère is not a womanizer, but he has not always been faithful to Diana either. Diana is a social worker, angry with Martin because he often travels without letting her know in advance, and he is surrounded by beautiful women.\n\nTogether with Sergej Orloff, he was educated by the guru Kut-Humi. Sergej and Martin were friends and after their education they received the weapons called \"Murchadna\" (ancient ray-guns from the lost Mu). However, their friendship ended after Sergej chose the evil path; his weapon can kill whereas Martin's Murchadna can only make the target faint when blasted. Murchadna lost its power later, but showed up a few times more.\n\nThe Men in Black are a secret group spreading over the whole world and their aim is to prevent people from learning the true history of the world. The group was founded by Adam--an Atlantean agent--after the great war between Atlantis and Mu. The main aim of the group was to protect mankind from such disasters. After centuries, the organization became corrupt and endeavored to keep the true history of man unknown. The group destroyed all traces of Atlantis and Mu to maintain \"world order\" (in line with schoolbook history).\n\nAnother secret group called \"Elsewhere\" is a United States secret government agency. This group was founded by Thomas Jefferson. Their aim is to save mankind and collect and hide secret and marvellous things. Sometimes they fight The Men in Black, but sometimes they work together. The main contrast between them and The Men in Black is, they don't destroy fantastic objects and beings. They protect and hide them, until mankind is ready to learn.\n\nKut-Humi is a wise man who has a relationship to Agarthi, which is \"a city both in this world and not\" (this can be explained as being a utopic city). He has taught Martin and Sergej on spiritual issues. He shows up when needed and guides Martin.\n\nIn the true history of the world (according to the comic \"Before The Great Flood\"), two major civilizations emerged on two different continents, named Mu (a pseudo-Asiatic realm ruled by an authoritarian, collectivistic philosophy) and Atlantis (a proto-Aryan regime devoted to individualism and capitalism); despite their ideological differences, both had developed advanced civilizations, comparable to the 'Eighties' ideas of an early 21st century. As a result of their rivalry, a great war flared up after several proxy conflicts fought over Gondwana, which ultimately saw the employment of nuclear warheads and other final weapons; in the end the losing side, triggered a doomsday machine, which plunged the world in a veritable cataclysm, destroying nearly every sign of the antediluvian civilization.\n\nThe Atlantis-Mu overarching storyline was very poignant in the early 1980s, when the comic was born, as the antediluvian holocaust represented a warning to mankind (then enveloped in the last throes of the USA-USSR arms race); it gradually lost importance during the nineties.\n\nMartin Mystère exists in the same fictional universe with other Sergio Bonelli comics characters, including Zagor, Mister No, and Dylan Dog, a universe which would eventually evolve into the science-fiction milieu of Nathan Never.\n\nAlso Martin meets Peter Pan in London. Peter explains the truth about Neverland.

It is located at the junction of County Road 59 (Veterans Memorial Drive) and County Road 151 (Moccasin Gap Road). Miccosukee was a major center of the Miccosukee tribe, one of the tribes of the developing Seminole nation, during the 18th century.\n\nMiccosukee, like other unincorporated areas in northern Leon County, is an area of rolling hills dotted with ponds and lakes. The large, swampy Lake Miccosukee borders the eastern edge of the community.\n\nThe town of Miccosukee or Mikasuki was settled by members of the Miccosukee tribe, a group of Creek origin who had settled in Florida and become part of the developing Seminole nation. The Miccosukee often fought armed battles with white settlers. It was mapped by the British in 1778 and originally called Mikasuki with 60 homes, 28 families, and a town square. Some 70 gunmen protected the town. It was the capital of the short-lived State of Muskogee.\n\nAt the time he visited on his voyage of destruction in 1818 (First Seminole War), \"Andrew Jackson and his men were stunned by the sheer size of the Miccosukee town. Having been occupied since before the American Revolution, it was a town of long-standing permanence.\" Jackson burned over 300 homes before departing on April 5, 1818.. Whites estimated there were up to 500 warriors, and \"the town was the largest in Florida at the time\".\n\nIn 1831, a U.S. Post Office was built along with schools, churches, and stores. Eventually the area became a center of cotton plantations, as was most of Leon County. Prior to the Civil War Miccosukee had three cotton plantations nearby, Miccosukee Plantation, Ingleside Plantation and Blakely Plantation.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the area reverted to farms and by 1887, the Florida Central Railroad served Miccosukee. During the 1890s, wealthy industrialists bought large tracts of land for quail hunting plantations or estates removing thousands of acres of land from agricultural production. Miccosukee thrived until the boll weevil infestation of 1918. The Great Depression (1929-1935) destroyed Leon County's agriculture and the railroad pulled out in the mid-1940s.\n\n\nDuring the Civil War, soldiers from Miccosukee enlisted in Company K, 5th Florida Infantry and Company B, 1st Florida Cavalry. The following soldiers are interred at Runners Cemetery and other locations. \n\n\n\n\n"}

Her father, Joseph, worked at the Swiss consulate. He and Doris May Hubert (née Fickling) had three children. Monica was brought up in England which was her mother's country whilst her father worked as the Swiss consul in Britain, New York and Australia. Monica attended Bedford College and studied French.\n\nWhilst working as a language assistant in Paris she met her fiance. In 1956 her new husband was Jean Charlot who was a political scientist. After following her husband to Africa where he was serving his national service in Algeria, Monica Charlot decided to obtain French qualifications for her teaching skills. This route was possible as Charlot had Swiss, English and French citizenships and the latter was essential to take this qualification. By this point she and Jean had three daughters.\n\nCharlot studied and competed against French students to become a qualified teacher (agrégée) of English. She spent only a few years teaching at Paris lycees before accepting a lectureship at the University of Nanterre. Charlot researched the British general elections from 1933 to 1970 and wrote this as her doctoral thesis and defended it in 1971. This successful thesis was important as previously studies by French students of British culture had concentrated on literature. Some of the changes Charlot introduced were seen as a popular answer to the issues raised by the 1968 student uprising.\n\nCharlot became a Professor at the Sorbonne Nouvelle University. As professor of British civilisation she targeted adding the study the social and political aspects of culture as a valid part of British and American studies. She was able to ensure that teachers would need to study these aspects as she created an exam paper on British civilisation which teachers had to pass as well as the usual papers on literature and language. Meanwhile, her husband Jean taught electoral politics at d'Edudes Politiques.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1991 she was in Oxford directing Maison française d'Oxford which was a French institution that was targeting cultural exchange with Britain. She exploited the Oxford University environment to diversify the institutions approach. Charlot was well qualified for this role as she had previously served on a trans-national political body created by Edward Heath and Georges Pompidou.\n\nShe created the \"Centre de Recherches et d'Études en Civilisation Britannique\", a single body to address the study of British civilisation in France. By the time she died in 2003 there were 250 people around France who were members. Moreover, there were over a hundred post doctorate students who had obtained their qualifications with Charlot as their supervisor.\n\nShe created fifteen books in her own right including several that became standard works.

Although postnationalism is not strictly considered the antonym of nationalism, the two terms and their associated assumptions are antithetic as postnationalism is an internationalistic process.\n\nThere are several factors that contribute to aspects of postnationalism, including economic, political, and cultural elements.\n\nIncreasing globalization of \"economic\" factors, such as the expansion of international trade with raw materials, manufactured goods, and services, and the importance of multinational corporations and internationalization of financial markets, have shifted emphasis from national economies to global ones. At the same time, socio-political power is partially transferred from national authorities to supernational entities, such as multinational corporations, the United Nations, the European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and NATO. In addition, media and entertainment industries are becoming increasingly global and facilitate the formation of trends and opinions on a supranational scale. Migration of individuals or groups between countries contributes to the formation of postnational identities and beliefs, even though attachment to citizenship and national identities often remains important.\n\nIn the scholarly literature, postnationalism is linked to the expansion of international human rights law and norms. International human rights norms are reflected in a growing stress on the rights of individuals in terms of their \"personhood,\" not just their citizenship. International human rights law does not recognize the right of entry to any state by non-citizens, but demands that individuals should be judged increasingly on universal criteria not particularistic criteria (such as blood descent in ethnicity, or favoring a particular sex). This has impacted citizenship and immigration law, especially in western countries. Germany, for example, has felt pressure to, and has diluted (if not eradicated), citizenship based on ethnic descent, which had caused German-born Turks, for example, to be excluded from German citizenship. Scholars identified with this argument include Yasemin Soysal, David Jacobson, and Saskia Sassen.\n\nThe European integration has created a system of supranational entities and is often discussed in relationship to the concept of postnationalism.\n\nIn 2015, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau while defining Canadian values declared his country to be the world’s first postnational state.\n\nCatherine Frost, professor of political science at McMaster University, argues that while the Internet and online social relations forge social and political bonds across national borders, they do not have \"the commitment or cohesiveness needed to underpin a demanding new mode of social and political relations\".\n\nPostnational trends have been evident in professional sports. Simon Kuper called the 2008 European soccer championship (UEFA Euro 2008) \"the first postnational\" European Championship. He argues that during the tournament both for players and fans sportsmanship and enjoyment of the event were more important than national rivalries or even winning.\n\n"}

These coins were often continuations of the original currencies that existed prior to the arrival of the Romans. Because so many of them were minted in the Greek areas of the empire, they were usually referred to until fairly recently as Greek Imperial coinage, and catalogued at the end of lists of coins minted by the Greek cities. \n\nWhen a new region was assimilated into Roman civilization, the continuance of pre-existing local currencies was often allowed as a matter of expediency. Also, new colonies were frequently given authority to mint bronze coins. These provincial currencies were mostly used by the local inhabitants only for local trade – as their intrinsic values were usually much lower than Roman imperial coinage.\n\nProvincial coins were issued in silver, billon and bronze denominations, though never gold.\nThe majority were bronze. Silver and billon coins were more common in the Eastern regions of the Empire, particularly Alexandria. In general, the issuance of silver coinage was controlled by Rome. That gave the imperial government a measure of control and influence throughout the empire. Some coins that circulated in the eastern parts of the empire may have been minted at the mint of Rome.\nBy 210 BC Rome was controlling all of the Greek cities in the region of Magna Graecia. At the beginning of the next century a clear Roman influence on the Greek coinage can be noticed. Both iconography and style of the coins had changed. Greek coinage from this period can be classified as the first instances of Roman provincial currency.\n\nThere were over 600 provincial mints during the Imperial Era. The mints were located throughout the Empire, with a particular concentration in the Eastern portions of the Empire.\n\nMajor provincial cities such as Corinth or Antioch possessed their own minting capabilities. Some mints issued only for their cities (Viminacium) while others issued coins for entire province (e.g. Moesia). There are several cities known by their coins, as there is no historical mention of them.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37998218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37998218", "title": "Secondary burial", "text": "Secondary burial\n\nThe secondary burial (German: \"Nachbestattung\" or \"Sekundärbestattung\") is a feature of certain prehistoric grave sites of all types, identified since the New Stone Age, which is a frequent feature of megalithic tombs and tumuli. Secondary burials were also a mortuary custom among many Native American cultures.\n\nFrom an archaeological and ethnographic perspective, the types of burial ceremonies for the dead are divided into two categories: primary burials and secondary burials. Primary burials refers to the initial burial, with temporary or final severance of all physical contact of family and community members with the deceased. Secondary burials may (but do not always) occur after the primary ceremony. Any remains are the focus of the secondary ceremony. These remains are used to alter the spiritual condition of the deceased.\n\nArtificial mounds and other, clearly visible, above-ground structures have been re-used since the New Stone Age (and even in later times, often by much later cultures) for burials of bodies, bones or cremated remains (in urns). These more recent burials, of whatever form, are referred to by archaeologists as secondary burials. They are found in grave mounds, usually in those areas of the site that could at the same time be extended. In larger dolmens, passage graves, stone cists, etc. the re-use of the interior space available was usually closer in time to the original burial (e.g. by the Globular Amphora culture), if necessary also accompanied by the removal or addition of secondary chambers (as in the Megalithic tombs of Hagestad). The mounds of the megalithic tombs, which were usually covered with earth, were re-used following a similar shape as the original grave mound.\n\nSecondary burial in the Holy Land involved an initial interment in a tomb, for example, prone on a bench, until the body decayed. Subsequently, the decayed remains would be relegated to a nearby receptacle within the same tomb. Later, another person, typically a later member of the same family, would be placed on the same bench, and the process would continue. This practice is described in the article on Ketef Hinnom.\n\nThis practice of secondary burial should be distinguished from the continual use of natural caves, even when this falls during the same historical period, because they did not involve artificially constructed monuments.\n\nMuch of the recordings of burial ceremonies were from the observations of explorers, missionaries, and administrative personnel who lived amongst native peoples. In the late 19th and early 20th century. Three important figures in analyzing these accounts were Hertz, Schärer, and Stöher. These scholars characterized the secondary burials of the Ngadju-Daya communities. These communities were part of the Dayak culture in Indonesia, and had a very structured approach to secondary burial ceremonies. These highly structured ceremonies helped the community feel as though they had some semblance of control over death. The translation and interpretation of Hertz’ thesis was seminal in the field, and is still used as a basis for understanding and interpreting current cultural practices of secondary burial. The overarching theme for Hertz was that in the Ngadju-Daya communities there was a moral obligation from both the family and community to benefit the deceased in the afterlife. In addition to providing for the deceased, this ceremony emphasized the greater good of the community over individualism. However, it is important to note that neither Hertz, Schärer, or Stöher lived amongst these native people, leaving room for misinterpretation and bias.\n\nSecondary burials are also seen in many cultures over the centuries outside of the Ngadja-Daya. The unique characteristics and frequency of secondary burials are often used to help identify and characterize past settlements. These traditions have left a strong impression on people’s minds today, and hence have affected how we view past cultures in general. Some more well-known examples include the megaliths from the late Funnel Beaker culture, the stringent procedures in the single burial graves of the Battle Axe culture, and the uniqueness of the Pitted Ware Culture. Some cultures even contain the remains of multiple individuals being subjected to fire, but defleshing as well.\n\nAsa Larsson: \"Secondary Burial Practices in the Middle Neolithic-Causes and Consequences\".

Other names for this style include drainpipes, stovepipes, tight pants, cigarette pants, skinny jeans, pencil pants, skinny pants, gas pipes, and skinnies. Skinny jeans taper completely at the bottom of the leg, whereas drainpipe jeans are skinny but then the lower leg is straight instead of tapering and so they are often slightly baggier at the bottom of the leg than skinny jeans. In some styles, zippers are needed at the bottom of the leg to facilitate pulling them over the feet. Stretch denim, with anywhere from 2% to 4% spandex, may be used to allow jeans to have a super-slim fit. Skinny jeans come in a variety of colors and styles.\n\nBefore the 18th century, European men wore breeches and hose. In Tudor times, these breeches were loose-fitting, but by the 1660s, tight breeches were fashionable. These were popularised by Frenchmen at the court of Louis XIII, as part of the three piece suit that also included a type of frock coat called a Justacorps, a tricorne hat, a powdered wig, and a long waistcoat. During the Restoration era, the tighter breeches were introduced to England, and the rest of Europe, because the cut was deemed more flattering to the leg.\n\nFrom the 16th until the 19th century, the Mughlai nobility attired themselves in tight-fitting Churidars which were worn tied below the knee. These trousers, and other elements of traditional clothing like the Shalwar Kameez, were often worn by Englishmen working in India, especially officers of the East India Trading Company.\n\nTight fitting trousers were fashionable from 1805 until 1850, being descended from the loose work trousers worn as a political statement by Sans-Culottes during the French Revolution. These \"pantaloons,\" popularised by Regency era Englishmen like Beau Brummel, were worn high on the waist and tailored to accentuate the leg like the breeches previously fashionable among the upper class. Pantaloons were tied (or buttoned) around the ankle and commonly put into boots.\n\nPants, which had come to mean tight-fitting trousers, but now just a synonym, fitted more loosely from the 1840s onwards as mass-production replaced tailoring. Beginning in the Edwardian era and continuing into the 1920s, baggy \"Oxford\" or \"collegiate\" trousers and plus fours were fashionable among the younger generation. As the name suggests, Oxford bags originated at the UK's elite universities, where young upper class men pursued an active, sports-centred lifestyle.\n\nDrainpipe trousers re-emerged in the 1950s, with popular Western stars such as the singing cowboy Roy Rogers, The Lone Ranger, The Cisco Kid, Zorro and Gene Autry and actresses Marilyn Monroe and Sandra Dee wearing their pants very slim to the ankle from 1955 onwards. Tapered jeans became most notable with country music stars and with the birth of rock and roll in the 1950s, when Elvis Presley donned slim-fitting jeans and shocked the country. Drainpipe jeans and rock 'n' roll were inextricably linked to create the \"bad boy\" image that remains today.\n\nIn the early 1960s, drainpipes were worn by numerous rock bands and musicians, including The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. Fashion icon Audrey Hepburn also raised the popularity of drainpipe jeans. Slim fitting pants and jeans were worn not just by members of the teenage Mod or greaser subculture but also ordinary people. The trend lasted until the end of the 1960s when \"hippie\" culture gave rise to the return to fashionability of flared pants and bell bottom jeans.\n\nIn the early 1970s, glam rock and rockabilly bands reviving the Teddy Boy look popularised drainpipe jeans in contrast to the flared trousers worn by hippies. Red tartan drainpipe jeans (as they were then called) were popular in the punk subculture of the late 1970s, and were worn by many bands and scene leaders such as Ramones, The Clash and Sex Pistols.\n\nSkin-tight acid-washed jeans were also popular in the 1980s with most heavy metal bands, and in particular those in the thrash metal scene, such as Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer. This was the trend for those who did not wear spandex, which was popular with the dominant heavy metal scene at the time. They were often worn with white high-top sneakers or basketball shoes like Converse. By the late 1980s, drainpipe pants were largely superseded by straight leg jeans like Levi 501s, but remained popular among fans of hard rock until the 1990s. Tight fitting jeans were also worn by pop stars like Michael Jackson and Freddie Mercury.\n\nBy the early 1990s, many glam metal bands such as Poison, Mötley Crüe, Kiss, Bon Jovi, and Slaughter, abandoned spandex and wore form fitted jeans. Tight jeans were also worn by members of the casual subculture from the late 80s until the mid 90s, including Ewan McGregor in Trainspotting. However, with the rise of grunge and hip-hop music in the mid 1990s and the post thrash movement, drainpipe jeans quickly went out of fashion in favor of baggy carpenter jeans, as worn by hip-hop/rap acts such as Kris Kross, Another Bad Creation, and Snoop Dogg. Flared jeans also made a comeback from the mid-1990s onward, furthering the move away from the drainpipe styles.\n\nThe 2000s saw the continued rejection of slim-fitting pants and jeans throughout the early and middle years in mainstream fashion. However, in 2005, fitted pants were reintroduced to the mainstream market for women. This new style of pants was called \"skinny jeans\". During its first year, skinny jeans were only sold online, and they were not available in stores. Initially, they were not well received by the public, though there were some early adopters. It was not until 2006 that skinny jeans gained more steam in fashion world, and by this time skinny jeans were being sold at shopping malls. Throughout 2007 skinny jeans received more mainstream exposure as fashion trends started moving away from the bell bottoms and baggy pants which had been dominant for the past 10 years. Men's skinny jeans were introduced in 2008 and became the norm by 2009.\n\nSkinny jeans first spread to men's fashion in 2008. This has continued into the 2010s, entering the mainstream fashion in 2011. Since, it has remain popular and eventually became one of the decade's defining fashion pieces for both men and women. They have become so popular that many men have expanded their wardrobe to include tight fitting chino trousers coming with variety of colors, but often in khaki, brown or white.\n\nWomen's skinny jeans saw the high-waist trend coming back in style. Just like men's the female skinny jeans came in various colors, often in neutral colors like khaki and white.\n\nIn Europe, skinny jeans for boys and men have a loose waist to appear \"baggy\" at the top but skinny on the legs.\n\nVictorian doctors theorised that tight trousers caused an outbreak of apoplexy in New York. However, the veracity of this claim is questionable, given the often speculative nature of early modern medicine.\n\nIn modern times, some physicians believe tight trousers may cause numbness due to compression of nerves. For example, this may affect the outer thigh in the condition meralgia paraesthetica.\n\nA recent study by Korean doctors suggests that skinny jeans can cause varicose veins. Among men, tight trousers may also cause dyspermia due to overheating of the testes.\n\nA study in 2015 documented the case of skinny jeans causing rhabdomyolysis, bilateral peroneal and tibial neuropathies.\n\nIn the early and mid-2010s, some Middle Eastern Islamist groups disapproved of tight trousers, because they are considered immodest, overtly sexual, or a threat to local traditions. In Saudi Arabia, the police are instructed to arrest teenagers who dress this way because the tight jeans are seen as un-Islamic and, when worn by men, a sign of homosexuality. In the Gaza strip, Palestinian youths caught wearing skinny jeans have been arrested and beaten by the Hamas police. In Sudan the police have imprisoned and fined women for wearing tight trousers. In 2012, unknown individuals murdered between twelve and one hundred people in Iraq. Among them were \"emos\" of both sexes wearing tight clothes and emo hairstyles. In the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, offenders wearing tight jeans could face a ten-day imprisonment period that could be extended indefinitely until they pass a test on an Islamic course.\n\n"}

The conflict evolved in 2010 and climaxes in 2012, with the defeat of main rebel forces. Other incidents took place in September 2015, when former deputy defense minister Abduhalim Nazarzoda led an armed uprising, suspected with ties to the Islamic Renaissance Party.\n\nOn 19 September, more than 25 Tajik soldiers were killed in an ambush by suspected Islamist fighters, allied with the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan. The soldiers were part of a 75-man convoy moving through the Rasht Valley, in eastern Tajikistan. They were ambushed while searching for members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan who previously escaped from a detention prison in Dushanbe on 25 August. The military column was ambushed by gunmen around midday local time, while passing through the mountainous Rasht Valley, approximately 250 km (150 miles) east of the capital. The column sustained heavy fire from machine-guns and grenade launchers, in the mountains from above. Initial reports indicated that 40 soldiers were killed but the Tajik minister of defense denied this. Five Tajik officers were among the dead. None of the attackers were reported to have been killed or wounded.\nOn 4 October, 5 Tajik soldiers along with two insurgents were killed during a military operation in Rasht Valley. The incident occurred, when a vehicle was stopped at a military checkpoint on the road between Garm and Dushanbe. As the soldiers approached the car, gunmen opened fire killing five of them and wounding an additional three more. The soldiers retaliated opening fire at the vehicle, killing the two attackers. Among the dead was a high ranked Tajik officer. Meanwhile, dozens of caches of heavy weapons including grenade launchers, as well as food and medication were discovered in an abandoned Islamist hideout. Twelve military checkpoints were set on the roads leading from the administered region of Rasht to the capital Dushambe.\n\nOn 7 October, 28 servicemen from the Presidential National Guard were killed when their helicopter crashed during an operation in Rasht Valley near the towns of Ezgand and Tavildara. The helicopter became caught in power lines and crashed while attempting to land, leaving no survivors. The helicopter was bringing service men from the capital Dushanbe to the Rasht Valley to take part in the operation.\n\nThe same day, 6 other soldiers were killed in a separate incident caused by an accidental mine explosion.\n\nOn 18 October, three suspected insurgents were killed by Tajik soldiers on the outskirts of Garm, located near the Afghan border during a military operation.\n\nOn 1 December, gunmen shot and killed 3 Tajik soldiers in the village of Dulona-Maidon in the Buljuvon Region, 150 kilometers southeast of Dushanbe.\n\nOn 27 December, 2 Tajik soldiers were killed when a group of thirty Islamists tried to enter Tajikistan from the Afghan border. After three hours of fighting, a combat helicopter arrived, opening fire on the intruders forcing them to retreat into Afghanistan. Local residents said that three Tajik soldiers were killed with two being the victims of friendly-fire from the helicopter. The Tajik military however claims no one was killed by friendly fire. Several Islamists were also killed in the attack.\n\nOn 4 January, Tajik authorities claimed Alovuddin Davlatov was killed along with seven other insurgents when Tajik security forces launched a special joint operation on his hideout in the town of Runob.\n\nOn 14 April, Mullah Abdullah a key opposition commander, along with ten other Islamists were killed by Tajik soldiers during a search operation for militants in the village of Samsolid, 135 kilometers east of Dushanbe.\n\nOn 21 July, the head of the Tajik Intelligence agency was assassinated by insurgents in the city of Ishkashim. The Tajik government then launched a joint military operation on the 25 July in the city of Khorog with the aim of capturing Tolib Ayombekov, who was said to be behind the 21 July killing and the 19 September ambush. More than 800 Tajik soldiers and several combat helicopters took part in the operation that lasted one day until Tajik president Emomali Rahmon halted all immediate operations in the area on the 25th. At the end of the day, more than 20 Tajik soldiers were killed and countless numbers were wounded. It's unknown the exact number of militants and civilians killed but military sources claimed more than 30 insurgents along with 30 civilians were killed. The operation was considered to be a success with Ayombekov and his army surrendering themselves to Tajik authorities in August.\n\nIn 2015, massive clashes with the rebels suspected of ties with the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan Party in the country resulted in 47 deaths.\n"}

They ruled an area known as An Mheallánacht, located between Slieve Gallon and Lough Neagh. They expanded southwards, one branch settling in Donaghmore, a second in Clonfeacle. Their lands between the Moy and Dungannon were known as Grange O Mellan. Churchland near Armagh was called Lurga Uí Mhealláin (Lurgyvallen). It is not known to which branch he belonged.\n\nTarlach joined a community of Franciscans who had been expelled from their convent in Armagh in the 16th century and settled in Tyrone under the protection of the Ó Neills of Cashlan. They built a friary in the townland of Gort Tamlach na Muc on the south side of Friary Loch. It was attacked and burned by the Scots on the morning of 15 June 1643.\n\nHe has been described as one \"who reflected the Ulster Catholic view of events. He was one of a generation of ardent Franciscans who were tireless in their efforts to record the Irish past for coming generations.\"\n\nTarlach was the chaplain to Felim O'Neill of Kinard during the war, and thus was present at many of the events he describes in the Cín Lae. Examples include the battle of Clones (13 June 1643) and the Battle of Benburb in 1646, of which he says \"Do bhenadar na sloite da cheile ar Dhruim Fhliuch\" (\"The armies met on Drum Flugh\"), thereby precisely identifying the battlefield.\n\"Tarlach had a detailed knowledge of the Ulster leaders. As he was familiar too with many of the places in which they fought, he is an invaluable source for the general historian, toponomyst and genealogist and, because of his language, he is an invaluable source for the linguist and the historian of Irish as well.\"\n\n\"The Cín Lae was written in abbreviated form, apparently as a memory aid to the author who may have intended to produce a fuller history of the period at a later date. Sadly, no such history appears to have been written ... [although] ... he ... had the opportunity of revising at least part of the script.\"\nIt is written on both sides of twenty-two small sheets of paper (approximately 18.5 cm by 14 cm).

He made an important political contribution to the state of Nova Scotia before its entry into Confederation of Canada. He was the first international best-selling author of fiction from what is now Canada. In 1856, he emigrated to England, where he served as a Conservative Member of Parliament.\n\nHe was the father of the British civil servant Lord Haliburton and of the anthropologist Robert Grant Haliburton.\n\nOn 17 December 1796, Thomas Chandler Haliburton was born in Windsor, Nova Scotia, the son of William Hersey Otis Haliburton, a lawyer, judge and political figure, and Lucy Chandler Grant. As a small child, his mother died. At the age of seven his father remarried to Susanna Davis. Davis was the daughter of Michael Francklin, who had been Nova Scotia's Lieutenant Governor. As an adolescent, he attended University of King's College in Windsor. After graduating, he became a lawyer, opening a practice in Annapolis Royal, the former capital of the colony.\n\nHaliburton attained distinction as a local businessman and as a judge, but his greatest fame came from his published writings. He wrote a number of books on history, politics, and farm improvement. He first rose to international fame with his \"Clockmaker\" serial, which first appeared in the \"Novascotian\" and later published as a book throughout the British Empire, becoming popular light reading. The work recounted the humorous adventures of the character Sam Slick.\n\nIn 1816, he married Lousia Nevill, daughter of Captain Laurence Neville, of the Eighth Light Dragoons.\n\nBetween 1826 and 1829, Haliburton represented Annapolis County in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly.\n\nThomas Chandler Haliburton resided in England from 1837, where he was hosted and entertained in London by his cousins Decimus Burton, Jane Burton, James Burton, the Egyptologist, Septimus Burton, the solicitor, Octavia Burton, and Jessy Burton. Thomas asked James Burton, the Egyptologist, to check the proofs of his work \"Letter Bag of the Great Western\", with which Burton was unimpressed, in 1839, and those of the third series of \"The Clockmaker\" in 1840. The pair travelled together to Scotland to investigate their common ancestry, and intended to tour Canada and the United States of America together. Thomas Chandler Haliburton's daughter, Susannah, was impressed by James Burton, the Egyptologist: she wrote, in 1839, \"Mr James I admire very much. He is one of the most well-bred persons I saw &... decidedly the flower of the flock\".\n\nIn 1856, Thomas Chandler Haliburton retired from law and moved to England. In the same year, he married Sarah Harriet Owen Williams. In 1859, Haliburton was elected the Member of Parliament for Launceston, Cornwall as a member of the Conservative minority; he did not stand for re-election in 1865.\n\nHaliburton received an honorary degree from Oxford for his services to literature. He continued writing until his death on 27 August 1865, at his home in Isleworth, near London.\n\nWhile in England, Thomas Chandler Haliburton met Louisa Neville, daughter of Captain Laurence Neville, of the Eighth Light Dragoons. In 1816, he married her, soon thereafter returning to Nova Scotia with her. Louisa's story before marriage is related in the \"Haliburton Chaplet,\" edited by their son, Robert Grant Haliburton (Toronto: 1899). The couple had two sons and five daughters: \n\nIn 1840, Louisa died and was buried at Windsor.\n\nHaliburton was eager to promote immigration to the colonies of British North America. One of his first written works was an emigrant's guide to Nova Scotia published in 1823, \"A General Description of Nova Scotia; Illustrated by a New and Correct Map\" The community of Haliburton, Nova Scotia was named after him. In Ontario, Haliburton County is named after Haliburton in recognition of his work as the first chair of the Canadian Land and Emigration Company.\n\nIn 1884, faculty and students at his \"alma mater\" founded a literary society in honour of the College's most celebrated man of letters. The Haliburton Society, still active at the University of King's College, Halifax, is the longest-standing collegial literary society throughout the Commonwealth of Nations and North America.\n\nThe mention \"hurly on the long pond on the ice\", which appears in the second volume of \"The Attaché, or Sam Slick in England\", a work of fiction published in 1844, has been interpreted by some as a reference to a hockey-like game he may have played during his years at King's College. It is the basis of Windsor's disputed claim to being the town that fathered hockey.\n\nIn 1902, a memorial to Haliburton and his first wife was erected in Christ Church, Windsor, by four of their children: Laura Cunard, Lord Haliburton, and two surviving sisters.\n\nNova Scotian artist William Valentine painted Haliburton's portrait. His former home in Windsor is preserved as a museum.\n\n\n"}

It was first posited in 1896 and published in 1898 by Rudolf Thurneysen, a comparative linguist more famous for his work on the Celtic branch of Indo-European and in particular for his \"Handbuch des Altirischen\". \n\nDespite being generally orthographically consistent with regard to voice, Gothic, even more so than other Germanic languages, displays a bewildering set of alternations between voiced and unvoiced spirant consonants. For example, the abstracting suffix -tumni is represented both as -tubni (fastubni, fraistubni, witubni) and as -dufni (waldufni, wundufni). These alternations, and other similar patterns unexplained by Verner's Law or by Proto-Germanic sound laws in general became the subject of Thurneysen's Law.\n\nThurneysen sought to classify the alternations in a general rule as follows:\n\nAlthough seeking, in the neogrammarian tradition, to produce an exceptionless sound law Thurneysen himself acknowledged several classes of exception to his rule.\n\n\nThe reception of Thurneysen's Law has been patchy at best. Many text- and handbooks choose to completely ignore it, or to pass over it with only slight mention, and it remains among the lesser known sound laws of Germanic philology. This is perhaps in part due to its limited scope, but certainly also due to what have been perceived as problematic aspects of its formulation, and the apparent exceptions listed above.\n\nIn 1968, Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle published a new and somewhat less sensitive form of Thurneysen's Law in modern notation. This version lacks Thurneysen's rules about consonantal clusters, and his observations on the effects of liquids. It has been seen, therefore, as deficient with respect to the original.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Historical linguistics]]\n[[Category:Indo-European linguistics]]\n[[Category:Sound laws]]"}
{"id": "5744903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5744903", "title": "Transphonologization", "text": "Transphonologization\n\nIn historical linguistics, transphonologization is a type of sound change whereby a phonemic contrast that used to involve a certain feature X evolves in such a way that the contrast is preserved, yet becomes associated with a different feature Y. \n\nFor example, a language contrasting two words * vs. * may evolve historically so that final consonants are dropped, yet the modern language preserves the contrast through the nature of the vowel, as in a pair vs. . Such a situation would be described by saying that a former contrast between oral and nasal consonants has been \"transphonologized\" into a contrast between oral vs. nasal vowels.\n\nThe term \"transphonologization\" was coined by André-Georges Haudricourt. The concept was defined and amply illustrated by Hagège & Haudricourt (1978: 74-111); it has been mentioned by several followers of Panchronic phonology, and beyond.\n\nOther tentative terms have been used to describe the same phenomenon – including \"rephonologization\" and \"cheshirization\" – yet with less success (see below).\n\nA common example of transphonologization is Germanic umlaut. \nIn many Germanic languages around 500–700 AD, a sound change fronted a back vowel when an or followed in the next syllable. Typically, the or was then lost, leading to a situation where a trace of the original or remains in the fronted quality of the preceding vowel. Alternatively, a distinction formerly expressed through the presence or absence of an or suffix was then re-expressed as a distinction between a front or back vowel.\n\nAs a specific instance of this, in prehistoric Old English, a certain class of nouns was marked by an suffix in the (nominative) plural, but had no suffix in the (nominative) singular. A word like \"mouse\", for example, had a plural \"mice\". After umlaut, the plural became pronounced , where the long back vowel was fronted, producing a new subphonemic front-rounded vowel , which serves as a secondary indicator of plurality. Subsequent loss of final , however, made a phoneme and the primary indicator of plurality, leading to a distinction between \"mouse\" and \"mice\". In this case, the lost sound left a trace in the presence of ; or equivalently, the distinction between singular and plural, formerly expressed through a suffix , has been re-expressed using a different feature, namely the front-back distinction of the main vowel. This distinction survives in the modern forms \"mouse\" and \"mice\" , although the specifics have been modified by the Great Vowel Shift.\n\nSimilar phenomena have been described in languages outside Germanic. \n\n\n\nBefore disappearing, a sound may trigger or prevent some phonetic change in its vicinity that would not otherwise have occurred, and which may remain long afterward. For example:\n\n\n\n\nRephonologization has been used by Roman Jakobson (1931 [1972]) to refer to essentially the same process, yet the term didn't catch on, due to its ambiguity. In a 1994 paper, Norman (1994) used it again in the context of a proposed Old Chinese sound change that transferred a distinction formerly expressed through putative pharyngealization of the initial consonant of a syllable to one expressed through presence or absence of a palatal glide before the main vowel of the syllable. However, \"rephonologization\" is occasionally used with another meaning, referring to changes such as the Germanic sound shift or the Slavic change from to , where the phonological relationships among sounds change but the number of phonemes stays the same. This can be viewed as a special case of the broader process being described here.\n\nJames Matisoff (1991:443) attempted the coinage cheshirization, as a synonym for transphonologization. This term jokingly refers to the Cheshire Cat, a character in the book \"Alice in Wonderland\", who \"vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone\". The term “cheshirization” has been used by some authors (e.g. McWhorter 2005; Chappell 2006) but never really caught on, due to its opacity. \n\n"}

The \"Versus\" is a short piece of only forty lines on the meeting between Mary Magdalene and the glorified Jesus Christ on the road as recorded in the \"Gospel of John\" (chapter 20). It is a follow-up to the \"Verses pascales de tres Maries\" and was probably designed as a liturgical drama for Easter Vigil as well.\n\nThe opening lines, spoken by the Magdalene, are an adaptation of the third chapter of the \"Song of Songs\". In the \"Vetus Latina\" and in one manuscript grouping of the Vulgate this chapter has the rubric \"Mariae Magdalenae ad Ecclesiam\": Mary Magdalene to the Church. The Vic dramatist evidently picked up on this allegorical exegesis and adapted it to his theme. As the play opens, Mary is searching a garden for the tomb of Christ. First some \"angeli\" (angels) and then an \"ortolanus\" (gardener) ask her why she is weeping and for whom she is looking. She mistakes the gardener for Christ when he says to her \"Mary, Mary, Mary!\" and she responds \"Raboni, raboni, master!\" The drama does not incorporate a sequence of her on the road meeting Christ, but jumps to her return to the garden from meeting him. There she scoffs at the gardener who deceived her and, meeting the \"discipuli\" (disciples), relates to them the fact of Christ's resurrection and the empty tomb. The disciples do not hesitate to believe her, \"Marie veraci\" (truthful Mary), over the \"whole deceitful multitude of Jews\" (\"Iudeorum turbe fallaci\"). The play ends on a prayer, sung by a \"chorus\" (choir), and the Greater Doxology.\n\nThe \"Versus\" is alone among the liturgical dramas of the Middle Ages in its choice of subject matter. The \"Epitalamica\", composed probably later that century at the Monastery of the Paraclete, is a non-dramatic treatment of the same theme, probably derived from the \"Versus\" if its relict dramatic feature are any indication.\n\nBesides the \"Song of Songs\" and John 20, the \"Versus\" relies on the Gospel accounts of the Jews spreading lies that Christ had not risen but merely been stolen from his grave. Outside of the Bible, the anonymous dramatist borrowed a verse form from the north Italian Latin ballad \"Foebus abierat\" (c. 1000), in which a lady sees a mirage of her lover's face and embraces it only to find it disappeared. This ballad had made its way to the Abbey of Ripoll by the twelfth century and would have been accessible to a dramatist working there or at Vic. This composer also drew on an earlier twelfth-century piece, the \"Victimae paschali\", for the scene of Mary and the disciples. This borrowing became commonplace in thirteenth-century Easter drama, but the Vic play may be its first dramatic adaptation.\n\nThe \"Versus\" is written in asclepiadic strophes, quatrains, monorhymed but with lines of varying length. The music for the play survives (the whole thing was sung) in Aquitainian neumes and its melodic structure mirrors its poetic. The play is preserved along with the \"Verses pascales\" in codex 105 of the Episcopal Museum of Vic.\n"}
