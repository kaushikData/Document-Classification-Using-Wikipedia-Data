In 1946, Fuller published a chart of the discoveries of the chemical elements over time to highlight the development of accelerating acceleration in human knowledge acquisition.\n\nIn 1958, Stanislaw Ulam wrote in reference to a conversation with John von Neumann: \n\nIn a series of published articles from 1974–1979, and then in his 1988 book \"Mind Children\", computer scientist and futurist Hans Moravec generalizes Moore's law to make predictions about the future of artificial life. Moore's law describes an exponential growth pattern in the complexity of integrated semiconductor circuits. Moravec extends this to include technologies from long before the integrated circuit to future forms of technology. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario in which robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030–2040.\nIn \"Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind\", published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving robot intelligence, generalizing Moore's Law to technologies predating the integrated circuit, and also plotting the exponentially increasing computational power of the brains of animals in evolutionary history. Extrapolating these trends, he speculates about a coming \"mind fire\" of rapidly expanding superintelligence similar to the explosion of intelligence predicted by Vinge.\n\nIn his TV series \"Connections\" (1978)—and sequels \"Connections²\" (1994) and \"Connections³\" (1997)—James Burke explores an \"Alternative View of Change\" (the subtitle of the series) that rejects the conventional linear and teleological view of historical progress. Burke contends that one cannot consider the development of any particular piece of the modern world in isolation. Rather, the entire gestalt of the modern world is the result of a web of interconnected events, each one consisting of a person or group acting for reasons of their own motivations (e.g., profit, curiosity, religious) with no concept of the final, modern result to which the actions of either them or their contemporaries would lead. The interplay of the results of these isolated events is what drives history and innovation, and is also the main focus of the series and its sequels.\n\nBurke also explores three corollaries to his initial thesis. The first is that, if history is driven by individuals who act only on what they know at the time, and not because of any idea as to where their actions will eventually lead, then predicting the future course of technological progress is merely conjecture. Therefore, if we are astonished by the connections Burke is able to weave among past events, then we will be equally surprised to what the events of today eventually will lead, especially events we weren't even aware of at the time.\n\nThe second and third corollaries are explored most in the introductory and concluding episodes, and they represent the downside of an interconnected history. If history progresses because of the synergistic interaction of past events and innovations, then as history does progress, the number of these events and innovations increases. This increase in possible connections causes the process of innovation to not only continue, but to accelerate. Burke poses the question of what happens when this rate of innovation, or more importantly change itself, becomes too much for the average person to handle, and what this means for individual power, liberty, and privacy.\n\nIn his book \"Mindsteps to the Cosmos\" (HarperCollins, August 1983), Gerald S. Hawkins elucidated his notion of 'mindsteps', dramatic and irreversible changes to paradigms or world views. He identified five distinct mindsteps in human history, and the technology that accompanied these \"new world views\": the invention of imagery, writing, mathematics, printing, the telescope, rocket, radio, TV, computer... \"Each one takes the collective mind closer to reality, one stage further along in its understanding of the relation of humans to the cosmos.\" He noted: \"The waiting period between the mindsteps is getting shorter. One can't help noticing the acceleration.\" Hawkins' empirical 'mindstep equation' quantified this, and gave dates for future mindsteps. The date of the next mindstep (5; the series begins at 0) is given as 2021, with two further, successively closer mindsteps in 2045 and 2051, until the limit of the series in 2053. His speculations ventured beyond the technological:\n\nThe mathematician Vernor Vinge popularized his ideas about exponentially accelerating technological change in the science fiction novel \"Marooned in Realtime\" (1986), set in a world of rapidly accelerating progress leading to the emergence of more and more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time intervals, until a point beyond human comprehension is reached. His subsequent Hugo award-winning novel \"A Fire Upon the Deep\" (1992) starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of a superintelligence passing through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a transcendent, almost omnipotent power unfathomable by mere humans. His already mentioned influential 1993 paper on the technological singularity compactly summarizes the basic ideas.\n\nIn his 1999 book \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\", Ray Kurzweil proposed \"The Law of Accelerating Returns\", according to which the rate of change in a wide variety of evolutionary systems (including but not limited to the growth of technologies) tends to increase exponentially. He gave further focus to this issue in a 2001 essay entitled \"The Law of Accelerating Returns\". In it, Kurzweil, after Moravec, argued for extending Moore's Law to describe exponential growth of diverse forms of technological progress. Whenever a technology approaches some kind of a barrier, according to Kurzweil, a new technology will be invented to allow us to cross that barrier. He cites numerous past examples of this to substantiate his assertions. He predicts that such paradigm shifts have and will continue to become increasingly common, leading to \"technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history.\" He believes the Law of Accelerating Returns implies that a technological singularity will occur before the end of the 21st century, around 2045. The essay begins:\n\nThe Law of Accelerating Returns has in many ways altered public perception of Moore's law. It is a common (but mistaken) belief that Moore's law makes predictions regarding all forms of technology, when really it only concerns semiconductor circuits. Many futurists still use the term \"Moore's law\" to describe ideas like those put forth by Moravec, Kurzweil and others.\n\nAccording to Kurzweil, since the beginning of evolution, more complex life forms have been evolving exponentially faster, with shorter and shorter intervals between the emergence of radically new life forms, such as human beings, who have the capacity to engineer (i.e. intentionally design with efficiency) a new trait which replaces relatively blind evolutionary mechanisms of selection for efficiency. By extension, the rate of technical progress amongst humans has also been exponentially increasing, as we discover more effective ways to do things, we also discover more effective ways to learn, i.e. language, numbers, written language, philosophy, scientific method, instruments of observation, tallying devices, mechanical calculators, computers, each of these major advances in our ability to account for information occur increasingly close together. Already within the past sixty years, life in the industrialized world has changed almost beyond recognition except for living memories from the first half of the 20th century. This pattern will culminate in unimaginable technological progress in the 21st century, leading to a singularity. Kurzweil elaborates on his views in his books \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\" and \"The Singularity Is Near\".\n\nAccelerating change may not be restricted to the Anthropocene Epoch, but a general and predictable developmental feature of the universe. The physical processes that generate an acceleration such as Moore's law are positive feedback loops giving rise to exponential or superexponential technological change. These dynamics lead to increasingly efficient and dense configurations of Space, Time, Energy, and Matter (STEM efficiency and density, or STEM \"compression\"). At the physical limit, this developmental process of accelerating change leads to black hole density organizations, a conclusion also reached by studies of the ultimate physical limits of computation in the universe.\n\nApplying this vision to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence leads to the idea that advanced intelligent life reconfigures itself into a black hole. Such advanced life forms would be interested in inner space, rather than outer space and interstellar expansion. They would thus in some way transcend reality, not be observable and it would be a solution to Fermi's paradox called the \"transcension hypothesis\", Another solution is that the black holes we observe could actually be interpreted as intelligent super-civilizations feeding on stars, or \"stellivores\". \nThis dynamics of evolution and development is an invitation to study the universe itself as evolving, developing. If the universe is a kind of superorganism, it may possibly tend to reproduce, naturally or artificially, with intelligent life playing a role.\n\nExamples of large human \"buy-ins\" into technology include the computer revolution, as well as massive government projects like the Manhattan Project and the Human Genome Project. The foundation organizing the Methuselah Mouse Prize believes aging research could be the subject of such a massive project if substantial progress is made in slowing or reversing cellular aging in mice.\n\nBoth Theodore Modis and Jonathan Huebner have argued—each from different perspectives—that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining.\n\nIn fact, \"technological singularity\" is just one of a few singularities detected through the analysis of a number of characteristics of the World System development, for example, with respect to the world population, world GDP, and some other economic indices. It has been shown that the hyperbolic pattern of the world demographic, economic, cultural, urbanistic, and technological growth (observed for many centuries, if not millennia prior to the 1970s) could be accounted for by a rather simple mechanism, the nonlinear second-order positive feedback, that was shown long ago to generate precisely the hyperbolic growth, known also as the \"blow-up regime\" (implying just finite-time singularities). In our case this nonlinear second order positive feedback looks as follows: more people – more potential inventors – faster technological growth – the carrying capacity of the Earth grows faster – faster population growth – more people – more potential inventors – faster technological growth, and so on. On the other hand, this research has shown that since the 1970s the World System does not develop hyperbolically any more, its development diverges more and more from the blow-up regime, and at present it is moving \"from singularity\", rather than \"toward singularity\".\n\nJürgen Schmidhuber calls the Singularity \"Omega\", referring to Teilhard de Chardin's Omega Point (1916). For Omega = 2040, he says the series Omega - 2 human lifetimes (n < 10; one lifetime = 80 years) roughly matches the most important events in human history.\n\nKurzweil created the following graphs to illustrate his beliefs concerning and his justification for his Law of Accelerating Returns.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "335669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=335669", "title": "Adémar de Chabannes", "text": "Adémar de Chabannes\n\nAdémar de Chabannes (sometimes \"Adhémar de Chabannes\") (c. 9891034) was an eleventh-century French monk, a historian, a musical composer and a successful literary forger.\n\nAdémar was born at Chabannes, a village in today's Haute-Vienne \"département\" of France. Educated at the Abbey Saint-Martial de Limoges, he passed his life as a monk, both there and at the monastery of Saint-Cybard at Angoulême. Adémar died around 1034, most probably at Jerusalem, where he had gone on a pilgrimage.\n\nWhen Adémar joined the Abbey Saint Martial of Limoges, he was educated by his uncle Roger de Chabannes, cantor of the Abbey between 1010 until his death in 1025. Adémar learned calligraphy, to read, to compose and to notate liturgical chant, to compile and to revise liturgical books, and to compose and to write liturgical poetry, homilies, chronicles and hagiography. His life was mainly spent in writing and transcribing chant books and chronicles, and his principal work is a history entitled \"Chronicon Aquitanicum et Francicum\" or \"Historia Francorum\". This is in three books and deals with Frankish history from the reign of Pharamond, king of the Franks, to 1028. The first two books are scarcely more than a copy of earlier histories of Frankish kings, such as the \"Liber Historiae Francorum\", the \"Continuation\" of Fredegar and the \"Annales regni Francorum\". The third book, which deals with the period from 814 to 1028, is of considerable historical importance. It relies partly on the \"Chronicon Aquitanicum\", to which Adémar himself added a final notice for the year 1028.\n\nHe embraced the developing tale that Saint Martial, the third century bishop who Christianized the Limoges district, had actually lived centuries earlier, and was in fact one of the original apostles. And he supplemented the less than scanty documentation for the alleged 'apostolicity' of Martial, first with a forged \"Life\" of Martial, as if composed by Martial's successor, Bishop Aurelian. To effect this claim, he composed an \"Apostolic Mass\" that still exists in Adémar's own hand (F-Pn lat. 1121, ff. 28v-32v). The local bishop and abbot seem to have cooperated in the project and the mass was first sung on Sunday, August 3, 1029.\n\nUnfortunately for Adémar, the liturgy was disrupted by a travelling monk, Benedict of Chiusa, who denounced the improved \"Vita\" of Martial as a provincial forgery and the new liturgy as offensive to God. The word spread, and the promising young monk was disgraced. Adémar's reaction was to build forgery upon forgery, inventing a Council of 1031 that confirmed the 'apostolic' status of Martial, even a forged papal letter. The reality of this pathological tissue of forgeries was only unravelled in the 1920s, by a historian, Louis Saltet. Mainstream Catholic historians ignored Saltet's revelations until the 1990s. \n\nIn the long run, Adémar was successful. By the late 11th century, Martial was indeed venerated in Aquitaine as an apostle, though his legend was doubted elsewhere. In a very direct way, Adémar's Mass shows the power of liturgy to effect worship.\n\nAdémar composed his musical Mass and office according to the local school of his uncle Roger who worked as a cantor between 1010 until his death in 1025 at St. Martial Abbey using those modal patterns, as they have been documented in the tonaries of the new troper-prosers (F-Pn lat. 1121, 909), chant books to which Adémar had partly contributed as a notator. Concerning the Apostolic feast of the patron he composed as well the hymns as the music which had become the metier of a cantor at Saint Martial. For this liturgical occasion which he had to create, he contributed like other cantors with own compositions, especially in the tropes (extended musical items added to existing liturgical texts).\n\nAccording to James Grier, Professor of Music History in the Don Wright Faculty of Music at the University of Western Ontario, Adémar was the first person to write music using the musical notation still in use today. He placed the musical notes above the text, higher or lower according to the pitch. Professor Grier states that \"Placement on the vertical axis remains the standard convention for indicating pitch in notation in Western culture and there is far greater weight on pitch than on many other elements such as dynamics and timbre\". Therefore, in discovering this document written around 1000 years in the past, Professor Grier turns Adémar in one of the first—if not the first—to write music using \"modern\" notation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This recruitment was in fact an emergency measure, as the Dutch army lost thousands of European soldiers and a much larger number of \"native\" soldiers in the Java War against Prince Diponegoro.\n\nFollowing the independence of Belgium in 1830, the Netherlands’ population was considerably diminished, making colonial combat losses more difficult to replace. Furthermore, the Dutch wanted the number of locally recruited soldiers in the East Indies Army to be limited to roughly half the total strength, to ensure the loyalty of native forces. It was also hoped that Akan soldiers would be more resistant to the tropical climate and tropical diseases of the Dutch East Indies than Dutch soldiers.\n\nThe soldiers from the Gold Coast were first recruited in Elmina. Of the 150 that were enlisted, 44 were descendants of Euro-African families in Elmina. They were deployed in 1832 in southern Sumatra. The West Africans proved less resistant to the climate than had been hoped, but their physique and general appearance as soldiers impressed the Sumatran population. In 1836 a further group of 88 Akan soldiers arrived in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch government then decided to recruit from the Ashanti people.\n\nIn the autumn of 1836 Major General Jan Verveer undertook a mission to the King of Ashanti. On November 1, 1836, after he had arrived in Elmina, General Verveer departed with a retinue of about 900 people (the majority porters carrying provisions and gifts) to the capital of the Ashanti kingdom, Comassie (Kumasi). After lengthy negotiations, an agreement was concluded with King Kwaku Dua. In Kumasi, a recruiting branch office was established by Jacob Huydecoper, a Dutch government official from Elmina of mixed Dutch-African descent. Kwaku Dua also sent two princes, Kwasi Boachi and Kwame Poku Boachi, to Verveer in the Netherlands for training. Their subsequent careers are described by Arthur Japin in his novel \"The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi\" (1997).\n\nBecause the British had abolished slavery, a somewhat cautious approach to recruitment was taken. The Ashanti king offered slaves and prisoners of war from the surrounding regions, for Dutch colonial service. However they nominally put themselves forward as voluntary recruits. As Dutch military service personnel they were entitled to receive pay. However British objections in 1842 led to discontinuation of this relatively successful recruitment. In 1855 enrollment resumed due to the positive experiences of West African soldiers in the Dutch East Indies. This renewed recruitment was now on a strictly voluntary basis.\n\nA total of several thousand African soldiers \"with a Dutch name\", were shipped to the Dutch East Indies. The Treaty of Sumatra in 1871 gave the Netherlands possessions on the Gold Coast to the British. This terminated the recruitment of Africans for the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. On April 20, 1872 the last ship with African recruits left for Java. There were however two further attempts to recruit black volunteers for the Colonial Army. Between 1876 and 1879 thirty American black recruits were hired for the KNIL. In 1890 there was an attempt to obtain recruits from Liberia. A total of 189 Liberians went to Java, but this group became almost entirely dissatisfied with failed promises and returned to Liberia in 1892. Even without the recruitment of African soldiers, the KNIL still had soldiers of African origin in its army long after the 1890s. These African and Indo-African soldiers were the offspring of the Africans that the Dutch shipped from the Dutch Gold Coast between 1830 and 1872.\n\n\n\n"}

More generally, bronze is traditionally the most common metal used for all types of high-quality medals, including artistic ones. The practice of awarding bronze third place medals began at the 1904 Olympic Games in St. Louis, Missouri, before which only first and second places were awarded.\n\nMinting Olympic medals is the responsibility of the host city. From 1928–1968 the design was always the same: the obverse showed a generic design by Florentine artist Giuseppe Cassioli with text giving the host city; the reverse showed another generic design of an Olympic champion. From 1972–2000, Cassioli's design (or a slight reworking) remained on the obverse with a custom design by the host city on the reverse. Noting that Cassioli's design showed a Roman amphitheatre for what was originally a Greek game, a new obverse design was commissioned for the Athens 2004 Games. Winter Olympics medals have been of more varied design.\n\nIn a few tournament sports, such as boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals are awarded in each event – one for each eliminated semi-finalist or for the winners of the \"repechage\" brackets.\n\nIn 1995, a study was carried out by social psychologists Victoria Medvec, Scott Madey and Thomas Gilovich on the effects of counterfactual thinking on the Olympics. The study showed that athletes who won the bronze medal were significantly happier with their winning than those athletes who won the silver medal. The silver medalists were more frustrated because they had missed the gold medal, while the bronze medalists were simply happy to have received any honors at all (instead of no medal for fourth place).\nThis is more pronounced in knockout competitions, where the bronze medals are achieved by winning a playoff, whereas silver medals are awarded after a defeat in the final.\nThis psychological phenomenon was parodied in the Jerry Seinfeld special \"I'm Telling You for the Last Time\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "92815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92815", "title": "Choctaw mythology", "text": "Choctaw mythology\n\nChoctaw mythology is related to Choctaws, a Native American tribe originally from the Southeastern United States (Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana). In the 19th century, Choctaws were known as one of the \"Five Civilized Tribes.\" Today the Choctaws have four tribes, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Jena Band of Choctaw Indians, and the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians.\n\nThe Choctaw and their ancestors have lived in the Mississippi region for about 4000 to 8000 years. Thousands of years of myth and story-making have contributed to a rich collection of history that spans the centuries. The Choctaw continue to tell and write about the legends that many have experienced in the American Deep South.\n\nThe Choctaw who remain in Mississippi tell this story as an explanation of how they came to the land where they live now and of how Nanih Waiya Mound came to be. These are real facts.\n\nTwo brothers, Chata and Chicksah led the original people from a land in the far west that had ceased to prosper. The people traveled for a long time, guided by a magical pole. Each night, when the people stopped to camp, the pole was placed in the ground and in the morning the people would travel in the direction in which the pole leaned.\n\nAfter traveling for an extremely long time, they finally came to a place where the pole remained upright. In this place, they laid to rest the bones of their ancestors, which they had carried in buffalo sacks from the original land in the west.\n\nThe mound grew out of that great burial.\n\nAfter the burial, the brothers discovered that the land could not support all the people. Chicksah took half the people and departed to the North and eventually became the Chickasaw tribe.\n\nChatah and the others remained near the mound and are now known as the Choctaw.\n\nAt the beginning there was a great mound. It was called Nanih Waiya. It was from this mound that the creator fashioned the first of the people. These people crawled through a long, dark cave into daylight and became the first Choctaw.\n\nSome early writers, and in later times Cushman and Bushnell, report that the Choctaws believed in a great good spirit and a great evil spirit. It seems that there were a number of supernatural beings mentioned in Choctaw historical accounts. In addition to the native language for what would today be termed God and Devil, the Choctaws believed they had many other \"powerful beings\" in their midst.\n\nThe Great Spirit of the Choctaw went by various names. Rev. Alfred Wright also said The Great Spirit was referred to as \"Nanapesa,\" \"Ishtahullo-chito\" or \"Nanishta-hullo-chito,\" \"Hushtahli,\" and \"Uba Pike\" or \"Aba.\" \"Shilup chitoh osh\" is a term anglicized to mean The Great Spirit. \"Chitokaka\" means The Great One. The terms \"lshtahullo\" or \"nanishtahullo\" is applied to anything thought to possess some occult or superior power - such as a witch.\n\n\"Hushtahli\" is from \"Hashi\" (sun) and \"Tahli\" (to complete an action). \"Hushtahli\" is believed to have originated as a Choctaw term without European influence; the Choctaw were believed to be sun worshipers. Fire was the \"most striking representation of the sun\", having intelligence, and was considered to be in constant communication with the sun.\n\nThe Choctaw venerated \"Sinti lapitta\", which was a horned serpent that visited unusually wise young men.\n\nThey believed in a little man, about two feet high, who dwelled alone in the thick, dark woods. The little man was called \"Bohpoli\" or \"Kowi anukasha\", both names being used alone or together. The translation of \"Bohpoli\" is the \"Thrower\". The translation of \"Kowi anuskasha \"is \"The one who stays in the woods\", or to give a more concise translation, \"Forest dweller\". Little man can be compared to the European counterparts- dwarfs, elves, gnomes, and leprechauns.\n\nlittle grass known as (ole) to be rather mischievous, but not malicious. The Choctaws believed that they held sticks and stones in them. All unexplained sounds heard in the woods were attributed to (ole) or little grass, believing it took a special pleasure in hitting the pine trees to create noise.\n\nBohpoli was never seen by the common Choctaws, only the prophets and doctors. The Indian doctors would report that Bohpoli assisted them in the manufacture of their medicines. Some stories even give the account that bohpoli would \"steal\" little children and take them into the woods, to teach them about herbs and medicines. After returning the children to their homes, Bohpoli would leave them alone, letting them grow up to become doctors of the tribe.\n\nAn interesting being mentioned in some of the history writings is \"Kashehotapalo\", a combination of man and deer who delighted in frightening hunters. He was much admired for his speed and agility. If the Choctaws angered \"Kashehotapalo\", he would race ahead of them and warn the enemy or animals being hunted.\n\n\"Okwa Naholo\" or \"Oka Nahullo\" (white people of the water) dwelled in deep pools and had light skins like the skins of trout. They were believed to sometimes capture human beings whom they converted into beings like themselves.\n\n\"Hoklonote\" was a bad spirit who could assume any shape it desired; it was considered to read people's thoughts.\n\nThe Choctaws have stories about shadow beings. \"Nalusa Chito\", also known as a \"Impa Shilup\", was the soul-eater, great black being. If people allow evil thoughts or depression to enter their minds, it would creep inside them and eat their soul.\n\n\"Nalusa Falaya\" (long black being) resembled a man, but with very small eyes and long, pointed ears. He sometimes frightened hunters or transferred his power of doing harm. Some believed that \"Nalusa Falaya\" preferred to approach men by sliding on his stomach like a snake.\n\n\"Hashok Okwa Hui'ga\" (Grass Water Drop) was believed to have a connection to what is termed will-o-the-wisp. Only its heart is visible, and that only at night. \"Hashok Okwa Hui'ga\" leads astray anyone who looks at it.\n\nIt was also believed that every man had a \"shilombish\" (the outside shadow) which always followed him, and \"shilup\" (the inside shadow, or ghost) which after death goes to the land of ghosts. The \"shilombish\" was supposed to remain upon the earth, and wander restlessly about its former home, often moaning, to frighten its surviving friends, as to make them forsake the spot, and seek another place to live. It was also supposed to assume the form of a fox, or owl; and by barking like the one, and screeching like the other at night, cause great consternation, for the cry was considered ominous of bad things. The Choctaws could tell between the \"shilombish\" and animals it imitates. When a fox barks, or an owl screeches, another fox or owl replies. But when the \"shilombish\" imitates the sound of either animal, no response is given.and the shadow like beings would often stalk children of younger adult age.\n\n\"Ishkitini\", or the horned owl, was believed to prowl about at night killing men and animals. Many believed that when \"ishkitini\" screeched, it meant sudden death, such as a murder. If the \"ofunlo\" (screech owl) was heard, it was a sign that a child under seven in the family was going to die, as the child would be about the size of a small owl. If \"opa\" (a common owl) perched in a barn or on trees near the house and hooted, it foreboded death among the near relatives.\n\n\"Biskinik\", the sapsucker, was known as the newsbird. If he landed on a tree in their yard early in the morning, some \"hasty\" news would come before noon. If he perched there late at night, the news would come before morning.\n\nAnimals figure significantly in Choctaw mythology, as they do in most Native American myth cycles. For example, in Choctaw history, solar eclipses were attributed to black squirrels, and maize was a gift from the birds \n\n\"Heloha\" (thunder) and \"Melatha\" (lightning) were responsible for the dramatic thunderstorms. In Choctaw mythology, they were two huge birds. \"Heloha\" would lay her giant eggs in the clouds and they would rumble as they rolled around atop the clouds. Despite his size, her mate, \"Melatha\", was extremely fast and left a trail of sparks as he streaked across the sky.\n\n\n"}

A. M. Renwick, however, defines it as an account of the Church's success and failure in carrying out Christ's Great Commission.

{"id": "40763026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40763026", "title": "Curvilinear principle", "text": "Curvilinear principle\n\nIn sociolinguistics, the curvilinear principle states that there is a tendency for linguistic change from below to originate from members of the central classes in a speech community's socioeconomic hierarchy, rather than from the outermost or exterior classes. \n\nDefined by William Labov, the curvilinear principle departs from traditional nineteenth century notions that language change generally originates in the highest or lowest classes of society. Instead, it states that variant forms leading to language change are typically introduced and motivated by the intermediate groups—the upper-working class and lower-middle class.\n\nThe principle can be seen as one response to an important question in sociolinguistics known as the \"embedding problem\", a problem \"concerned with determining regular patterns in both the linguistic and the extra-linguistic context of change.\" In other words, the embedding problem seeks to identify other changes or factors that have a non-coincidental relationship with the actual linguistic change. The curvilinear principle identifies such a non-trivial factor by proposing that a speaker’s class can indicate the degree to which he or she motivates linguistic change.\n\nThe principle's name refers to the curvilinear correlation that results from plotting the variation of a linguistic variable with respect to the class of the speakers. Because the lowest and highest classes generally tend to use newly emerging forms less frequently than central classes, data points representing variable usage resemble a concave curve when connected on a graph.\n\nIn The Philadelphia study, William Labov examined a series of linguistic variables in various stages of speech integration in order to evaluate whether the interior classes were, in fact, the innovators of linguistic change. In order to determine each speaker’s social position within the community, Labov created a socioeconomic status index based on education and occupation, each ranked on levels from 0 to 6, where 6 was the highest level of education or occupation. He studied a series of “new and vigorous” vowel changes, including the fronting and raising of (aw) and (ey) and the centralization of (ay). The research found that members of the upper working class and lower middle class used these variables more frequently than members of either the lower or upper class. This corroborated his curvilinear hypothesis because the middle classes were leading the use of these \"new and vigorous\" linguistic changes.\n\nIn his study of Norwich, England, Peter Trudgill examined different cases of linguistic variation and whether or not class could be related to realizations of certain linguistic variables. One of the observed variables was the (RP) quality of vowels in words like \"top\", \"hot\", and \"dog\". To determine a subject’s class, Trudgill calculated a score for each subject based on six parameters: subject’s occupation, father’s occupation, income, education, locality, and housing. Trudgill found that middle-class women were introducing the RP vowels in Norwich; working-class men were also introducing variation by borrowing a similar vowel associated with working-class speech from a nearby area. The distribution of linguistic variation in Trudgill’s study thus abides by the curvilinear principle because members of the central classes led the change.\n\nIn 1966, Labov published a study on linguistic variation on the Lower East Side neighborhood of New York City. In the study, he approximated each subject’s class with score that factored in his or her occupation, income, and education. Using these scores, Labov then grouped the subjects into 5 categories defined by sociologist Joseph Kahl: lower class, working class, lower middle class, upper middle class, and upper class (though Labov noted no subjects were considered upper class and that the presence of any upper-class people living on the Lower East Side would be unexpected).\n\nOne variable considered was (oh), the mid-back rounded vowel present in \"caught\", \"talk\", and \"dog\". Labov found that members of the working class and lower middle class—the central socioeconomic classes of the Lower East Side—used higher vowels for (oh) than did either the lower class or the middle class subjects. Labov recognized this as a linguistic change in progress, driven by the central class in accordance with the curvilinear principle.\n"}

She argued that the internal symbiosis of bacteria-like organisms had formed organelles like chloroplasts and mitochondria. She proposed that this had created the eukaryotes, and thus driven the expansion of life on Earth. She had argued that this process of symbiotic collaboration had run alongside the classical Darwinian cycle of mutation, natural selection and adaptation.\n\nRoberto Cazzolla Gatti, Ph.D., associate professor at Tomsk State University (Russia), argued in his hypothesis that \"the main likely cause of the evolution of sexual reproduction, the parasitism, also represents the origin of biodiversity\". \nIn other terms, this theory suggests that sexual reproduction acts as a conservative system against the inclusion of new genetic variations into cells' DNA (supported by the DNA repair systems) and, instead, the evolution of species can take place only when this preservative system fails to contrast the inclusion, within the host genome, of hexogen parts of DNA (and RNA) coming from obliged \"parasitic\" elements (viruses and phages) that establish a symbiosis with their hosts. \n\"As two parallel evolutionary lines – Cazzolla Gatti wrote in his original paper – sexual reproduction seems to preserve what the endogenosymbiosis moves to diversify. Following the former process, the species can adapt slowly and indefinitely to the external factors, adjusting themselves, but not 'creating' novelty. The latter process, instead, leads to the speciation due to sudden changes in genes sequences. Not only organelles can be symbiotic with other cells, as suggested Lynn Margulis, but entire pieces of genetic material coming from symbiotic parasites, can be included in the host DNA, changing the gene expression and addressing the speciation process\".\n\nThis idea challenges the canonical natural selection models based on the gradualism of the mutation-adaptation pattern, providing more support to the punctuated equilibrium theory proposed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge.\n\nTwo independent studies provide support for the hypothesis. Jamie E. Henzy and Welkin E. Johnson demonstrated that the complex evolutionary history of the IFIT (Interferon Induced proteins with Tetratricopeptide repeats) family of antiviral genes has been shaped by continuous interactions between mammalian hosts and their many viruses.\n\nDavid Enard and colleagues estimated that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive amino acid changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Their results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.\n\nPreviously, it was estimated that about 7–8% percent of the entire human genome carry about 100,000 pieces of DNA that came from endogenous retroviruses. This may be an underestimate.\n\nIn 2016 the biologists Sarah R. Bordestein and Seth R. Bordestein reported that genes are frequently transferred between hosts and parasites. Eukaryotic genes are often co-opted by viruses and bacterial genes are commonly found in bacteriophages. The presence of bacteriophages in symbiotic bacteria that obligately reside in eukaryotes may promote eukayotic DNA transfers to bacteriophages.\n"}

This is a linguistic misconception, and is sometimes used as a basis for linguistic prescription. An argument constitutes an etymological fallacy if it makes a claim about the present meaning of a word based exclusively on its etymology.\n\nA variant of the etymological fallacy involves looking for the true meaning of words by delving into their etymologies, or claiming that a word should be used in a particular way because it has a particular etymology. \n\nAn etymological fallacy becomes possible when a word has changed its meaning over time. Such changes can include a shift in scope (narrowing or widening of meanings) or of connotation (amelioration or pejoration). In some cases, meanings can also shift completely, so that the etymological meaning has no evident connection to the current meaning.\n\nAncient Greeks believed that there was a \"true meaning\" of a word, distinct from a common use. There is evidence that a similar belief existed among ancient Vedic scholars. In modern days this fallacy may be found in some arguments of language purists.\n\nNot every change in meaning leads to an etymological fallacy, but such changes are frequently the basis of inaccurate arguments.\n\nAn example of a word which has greatly changed its meaning is \"decimation\", which originally referred to reduction by a tenth, but now usually means a drastic reduction or complete destruction. Insisting that only the original meaning is \"true\" constitutes an etymological fallacy.\n\n\n"}

In 1984 he became tenured lecturer of University School, in 1995 tenured lecturer at the University of Barcelona where in 2003 obtained the Chair as Professor of Didactics of the Social Sciences.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002 he served as President of the Division of Education Sciences of the University of Barcelona and since 2008 to 2015 was Director of the Department of Didactics of Social Sciences at the same institution. On behalf of the party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya had the charge of General Director of Research of the Generalitat de Catalunya in the tripartite Government of Pasqual Maragall from 2003–2006, while Carles Solà to be Counselor of the Department of Universities, Research and Information Society. He renewed his charge as General Director of Research during the first months of the second tripartite Government, while Josep Huguet to be Counselor of the Department of Innovation, Universities and Enterprise. In March 2007 he resigned because in his opinion the Government of the Generalitat did not give strategic priority to research.\n\nAs General Director General of Research strengthened the system of research in Catalonia and promoted the creation of numerous recognized centers. During this time several institutions were launched to form the backbone of the Catalan research system:\n\nHe also collaborated in strengthening and creating new headquarters of research centres such as:\n\n\nThe ALBA Synchrotron works were undertaken during his tenure. In order to generate a powerful research network promoted the creation of a Catalan Agency for Research, inspired by the German model of the Max-Planck- and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, attempt which did not succeed because the seventh legislature came to a sudden end. For the same reason it was not possible to enact a Law of Science giving coverage to research strategies. He tried to link organically the Catalan research system with the French one, and important advances were aborted by the political situation.\nAmong the measures that he drove: the transformation of FI scholarship programme into contracts of employment of 3 years (plus 1 of previous grant); the creation of post-doctoral programme Beatriu de Pinós, oriented to the employment insertion of research personnel in companies; the creation of the Junior ICREA programme and the stabilization of the researchers belonging to the programme Ramon y Cajal. These initiatives were meant to lay the foundations of a research career in Catalonia. He also systematized and prompted calls and various research structures like the SGR (Support Grups de Recerca; a Support for research groups), ARIE (Ajunts per a la Recerca, Innovació i Educació); XIRE (Xarxes d'Innovació i Recerca Educativa); or Excava, to promote Catalan archaeological missions abroad (Althiburos, Oxirrinc, Bactriana, Syria, among others).\n\nAside from these initiatives he also made possible the work of prominent researchers in Catalonia, such as Joan Massagué, Manuel Perucho or Juan Carlos Izpisúa.\n\nHe worked as a teacher in Primary and Secondary education. His career as University tenured lecturer and Professor of University has been linked to the teaching of the Social Sciences, Didactics of History and Didactics of the Heritage.\n\nHe took part in the most diverse initiatives of educational research and innovation. He was the editor of the experimental curricula projects of Social and Cultural Environment (Primary Education) and Social Sciences (12-16) for the Educational Reform promoted by the Generalitat de Catalunya at the end of the 20th century.\n\nHe is a member of the Editorial Board of the journal \"Guix\" and was founder and co-director of the journal \"Iber: Didactics of Social Sciences, Geography and History\". He did research on textbooks and has also generated models for Primary and Secondary School based on the interaction between image and text, which have been widely replicated since the end of the 20th century to the present day. Major collections include Barcanova and Teide.\n\nHernández has also collaborated in the development of new types of educational materials based on the design of books of activities which integrate documentation and learning resources. He advocates for the application of the scientific method in the classroom, has developed various proposals to promote, using the discovery strategy, the work with different types of historical sources. In this sense, he conducted his doctoral thesis on the image of Catalonia in textbooks during post-Franco age: \"La Història de Catalunya a l'ensenyament primari i secundari (1975-1990)\".\n\nHe is author of numerous articles and books of theoretical reflection on the teaching of history and Social Sciences: \"Didáctica de las Ciencias Sociales\"; \"Ensenyar Història de Catalunya\"; \"12 ideas clave: Enseñar y aprender historia\". He has also written several books to disseminate history, as well as monographs on unique topics. He has published many papers and books of history including several synthesis of the history of Catalonia.\n\nHe has been main investigator of many competitive projects, among other four R&D of the Spanish \"National Plan for Research\". The bodies of the State (CNEAI) have recognized his work as researcher by granting him with four periods of six years (\"Sexenios de investigación\" in Spanish).\n\nHe has developed several works of innovation and research focused on the importance of the didactic iconography in history, and has applied the results in the preparation of social dissemination and textbooks. It has also developed models of virtual reconstruction of archaeological sites that help formulate hypothesis about parts and uses of buildings and urban ensembles.\n\nIt has tackled the challenge of recreating the evolution of a city in a limited space. The work carried out on the Iberian Citadel of Calafell (Tarragona); the Iberian settlement of Puig Castellar (Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Barcelona); the site of Empúries (Girona) and the recreation of the Roman city of Althiburos (Tunisia) and the city of Barcelona in the 18th century, among others, are the most outstanding experiences.\n\nOn the basis of the contributions of the British illustrator David Macaulay has created generic models of city and has recreated iconically its evolution over time. This work was developed in collaboration with the extraordinary illustrator Jordi Ballonga. The results were published by the Milanese publishing Jaca Book between 1990 and 1993, translated into different languages, and published in different countries (Italy, France, United Kingdom, Hungary, Netherlands, Romania, Tunisia, Spain -Catalan and Spanish editions-, United States, Japan and Germany). Three city models were designed: BARMI, a Mediterranean city in southern Europe; LEBEK, a city in Northern Europe; and SAN RAFAEL, a city in Central America.\n\nIn the context of the Tricentenari (1714–2014), and in collaboration with Guillem Hernández Pongiluppi, he presented an ambitious iconographic proposal around the siege of Barcelona in 1713-1714 and the battle of 11 September.\nHe has also collaborated with various artists (John Chien, Francesc Riart, Guillem Hernández, Mar Hernández) on issues related to the military defense and fortification, military technology and weaponry. \nNoteworthy is the impulse of new iconographic, digital strategies and matte painting, with illustrators such as Guillem Hernández Pongiluppi and Mar Hernández Pongiluppi.\n\nHe started his activities in museography in 1992, working in the project of partial restitution of the Iberian Citadel of Calafell (Tarragona), inspired by the educational experience of Lejre (Denmark). The relationship with Calafell finished with the musealisation of 1996. Almost in parallel, he coordinated the historical and museological executive project of the History Museum of Catalonia, which is implemented in a record time of 18 months and that was one of the first models in Europe in the field of didactic and interactive museology on history. The relationship of consultancy with the Museum ended in 1997 because of the regressive policy, in terms of interactive museography, imposed by the direction of the Museum. In the following years he criticized the policies driven by the direction teams of the Museum, the falsification and degradation of the original project and the lack of goals of the institution.\nHe has been Commissioner (along with Joaquim Torra) of the temporary exhibition \"Donec Perficiam\" installed in 2013 at the Born in Barcelona. It was one of the most visited temporary exhibitions of the city. The work explained the siege of Barcelona and stands as a model in museography by its modern conception, by the success of visitors, by the variety of museological strategies used, and also because of a quick design and implementation at low cost. Definitely it was the most successful exhibition in the context of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of 1714.\n\nIn his museography works he has promoted the concepts of didactic museology and educational heritage, assuming that the democratization of the access to knowledge requires museological and museographical proposals with a capacity to be understood by a broad target horizon.\n\nIn collaboration with Dr. Joan Santacana Mestre created in 2000 the research group \"Didactics of Heritage, Comprehensive museology and new technologies\" (DIDPATRI) and, within the framework of the Foundation Bosch i Gimpera and the Attica project, the quasi-firm \"Projects Workshop: Heritage and museology\".\n\nHe has coordinated and worked in numerous museological and museographic projects. Among others, he has participated in the design of projects for centers such as the Archaeological Museum of Catalonia, the monumental site of Empúries and the Maritime Museum of Barcelona. He has also worked in various executive projects as:\n\n\nHe collaborated in the founding of the UB-Projects project, an agreement between the University of Barcelona and the Euphon Group, and other collaboration agreements with different companies. He was co-director of the master's degree in Didactics of Museology (Les Heures-University of Barcelona).\n\nHe has directed several doctoral theses on aspects of history, heritage, museology and didactics (Dr. Josep Antoni Serra, Dr. Rafael Sospedra, Dr. Andreu Besolí, Dr. Ismael Almazán, Dr. Xavier Rubio, Dr. David Íñiguez and Dr. Pilar Molina).\n\nHe is author of numerous works and articles on museology and museology, such as \"Museologia crítica\" and \"Museos de historia. Entre la taxidermia y el nomadismo,\" both co-authored with Joan Santacana.\n\nHernández has participated in the didactic and cultural proposal for the revitalization of the excavations at Althiburos (Tunis).\n\nHe is coordinator of the consolidated research group of the Generalitat de Catalunya \"DIDPATRI: Didactics of Cultural Heritage\" (SGR 2009-245; SGR 2012-945), whose research focuses on the field of didactic museography.\n\nLately, he works on projects related to emerging lines of research such as museology and iconography, digital iconographic resources and uses of internet for museographic purposes.\nHe has a specialization in military history and currently is developing work and research in this field. One of his most emblematic works is the publication in 4 volumes of the military history of Catalonia (\"Història Militar de Catalunya\"), as well as the supplementary material elaborated together with Francesc Riart on uniforms of the armies during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Coronela and uniform studies in the Catalan countries.\n\nAmong the most notable unique contributions is the interpretation of the battles of Empúries (195 BC) and Battle of Muret (1213); as well as the hypotheses about the Empúries geography during Ancient and Medieval History, proposals drawn up based on the use of primary sources, simulation, game theory, fieldwork and aerial photograph. He actively promoted the recovery of the historical landscapes of the Battle of the Ebro, with works of research and dissemination: \"Ebro 1938\" and \"La Batalla de l'Ebre: Història, paisatge i patrimoni\". He has carried out field activities to identify specific areas of the battlefield and also participated in civic campaigns in defense of the integrity of the mountains of Pàndols and Cavalls (Tarragona).\n\nRegarding his archaeological works, he took park as member of DIDPATRI in the excavation of La Fatarella battlefield in collaboration with CSIC and the Association Lo Riu, and have also been relevant his works in the fields of Republican Aviation in the Penedés area in collaboration with the Institut d'Estudis Penedesencs.\n\nHe was author to the first attempt to write an Management Plan of the Historical Landscapse of the battle of the Ebro promoted by the Ministry of Territorial Policy and Public Works of the Generalitat de Catalunya.\n\nHernández has studied together with Francesc Riart and Xavier Rubio, the problem of creation of the Catalan army and La Coronela in 1713-1714. In collaboration with Francesc Riart has written the first illustrated atlas of uniform studies of the Catalan Countries and has also worked on the innovative work undertaken by Xavier Rubio on historical analysis, simulation and supercomputing. He was founder and first co-Editor of the journal \"Ebre 38: Revista Internacional de la Guerra Civil Espanyola\" \"(1936-1939)\". He has participated in the musealisation of large military sites: Dalt Vila (Ibiza), Walls of Ceuta and Melilla. Also has coordinated or participated in the first archaeological excavations of battlefields in Catalonia: Talamanca (2008), Cardedeu (2008), Prats de Rei (2009), Vesper de la Gloriosa (2010), Ordal (2010) and La Fatarella (2011).\n\nHis interest in the history of Barcelona has resulted in a co-authored work: \"Passat i present de Barcelona\", written between 1983 and 1991 in collaboration with Magda Fernández, Mercè Tatjer, Mercè Vidal and Alicia Suárez. Three edited volumes and a non-published fourth one show in a didactic fashion the evolution of the city of Barcelona from the origins up to the Olympic Games in 1992. Later, he wrote as a single author a synthesis of history of the city and several works on the history of the District of Sants. Of special interest was the recovery and publication of the inventory of the Vapor Vell de Sants in the year 1847, a crucial document to better understand the process of industrialization in Barcelona.\n\nOne of his most relevant contributions has been the cabalistic theory in the design of the Eixample quarter of Barcelona. Francesc Xavier Hernández has propugned the possibility of Ildefonso Cerdà as a designer of a new city as the capital of a new country, based on the Kabbalah, in the context of the rise of the Catalan Freemasonry during the 19th century.\nHernández has been involved in various civic movements in defence of the heritage. His contribution was relevant in the campaign in defense of the Vapor Vell de Sants, which was emblematic as it marked the beginning of the recovery of the industrial heritage in Catalonia. Also participated in the defense of the mountains of Pàndols and Cavalls against the installation of wind farms. His activism was important in the processes of defense and recovery of the historical landscapes of the Battle of the Ebro and other sites related to the Spanish Civil War. He participated very actively in the defense of the historical site of the Born market of Barcelona and its archaeological remains on the street of Sant Honorat.\n\nAs General Director of Research of the Generalitat de Catalunya, he decidedly opposed Ley de Fosas because in his understanding it was an instrument to prevent research on disappeared persons during the Spanish Civil War in Catalonia. At the same time he provided the funds to start the excavation of mass graves in Catalonia, which was neutralized by the Memorial Democràtic and the Vice President of the Catalan Government environment. Some of the archaeological campaigns in which he participated between 2003 and 2011, involving the recovery of bodies of soldiers (Albinyana, Gandesa, Castellbisbal, La Fatarella) were disabled or sabotaged by the Generalitat.\n\nFinally, Hernández has taken part in neighbourhood movements and he has served on several occasions as a union representative. Since 1970 he held against the Franco regime and also participated actively in the promotion of militant democracy in different parties and labor unions.\n\n"}

De Mafra was a member of the expeditions of Fernão de Magalhães of 1519–1521 and Ruy López de Villalobos of 1542–1545.\n\nDe Mafra was born in the town of Mafra, north of Lisbon, Portugal, or, according to other sources, in the town of Jérez de la Frontera, in Cadiz, Andalusia. In 1519, he became a crew member of the Magalhães expedition. De Mafra started as a seaman in the galleon \"Trinidad\", the armada's flagship, and was on board when the Portuguese captured the Spanish vessel at Benaconora, today Jailolo, in the Moluccas. He was imprisoned for 5 months at Ternate (20 km south of Benaconora), transferred to a jail at Banda Islands where he remained for 4 months. Thereafter he was transferred to Malacca for 5 months after what he was brought to Cochin, India, where he languished for two years. De Mafra was finally brought by the Portuguese to Lisbon together with his crew members including Gonzalo Gómez de Espinosa and Hans Bergen. Upon their arrival in Portugal in 1526 de Mafra, and his crew members were thrown in prison. Bergen died in jail while Espinosa was later released that year. De Mafra himself was detained due to his possession of important documents which included the books and papers from the \"Trinidad\". The manuscripts included navigational notes of Andrés de San Martín, who was the fleet's chief pilot and astrologer. It was later taken and mined by Portuguese historians. These manuscripts were later transferred to Spain during the Iberian Union in 1580-1640. The letters were accessed by several Spanish chroniclers, including Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas. These papers have been lost and now exist only in quotes, references, and citations by these historians.\n\nAfter numerous pleas by de Mafra to the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V of Spain to have him released, he was freed in early 1527, and immediately proceeded to Spain. He was given an audience with the emperor after which he went straight to Palos only to discover his wife, Catalina Martínez del Mercado, believing he had died during the voyage, had remarried, and sold their personal fortunes, and land properties. De Mafra wrote to the emperor complaining of his marital trouble, and asking for his intercession for the return of his possessions. The emperor agreed, and ordered an investigation be made by officials, and to have the matter resolved.\n\nDe Mafra goes back to the sea in 1531, and sails to Central, and South America. The governor of Guatemala, Pedro de Alvarado, in a letter written on November 20, 1536, tells the emperor he had hired the services of de Mafra as pilot, who is considered as one of the best sailors due to his experiences with the Magellan voyage. It's not clear where the expedition went but most scholars believe the fleet went to Peru.\n\nDe Mafra joined the expedition of Ruy López de Villalobos as pilot of the \"San Juan\", one of six ships. Thus it is a mystery that many scholars have been trying to solve, when we find him as one of the men of the galleon \"San Cristobal\" who made it to the port of Mazaua in 1543. The galleon was separated from the fleet during a severe storm as the ships sailed between Eniwetok and Ulithi. While stranded in one of those islands, he writes a document of the Magellan voyage, he talks about the meeting of Rajah Siaiu the chieftain of Mazaua. De Mafra wrote, \"This same chief [Rajah Siaiu] we saw in the year fifteen forty-three by those of us in the fleet of general Ruy López de Villalobos, and he still remembered Magellan, and displayed to us some of the things he [Magellan] had given him.\" According to Italian historian Antonio Pigafetta, \"Magellan's gift consisted of a garment of red, and yellow cloth made in the Turkish fashion, a red cap, knives, and mirrors\". De Mafra, and his crew members stayed in the island for about 5 to 6 months. This long stay suggested they had to repair the \"San Cristobal\" as it must have been damaged by the fierce storm. De Mafra was one of 117 survivors of the failed Villalobos expedition who made it to Malacca. There De Mafra, age 53, elected to stay together with 29 other crew members. The other survivors sailed for Lisbon in a Portuguese ship. De Mafra handed his manuscript to an unnamed sailor; this eventually reached Spain in transcribed form by an unknown editor where it remained hidden for many centuries in the \"Archive of the Indies\" in Madrid . It was eventually discovered and published in 1920.\n\nDe Mafra's document has been examined by American geographer Donald D. Brand. Brand dismissed it as nothing more than what de Mafra recalled on Andrés de San Martín writings, which de Mafra had with him until these were confiscated in Lisbon. \"It should be pointed out here that the previously unknown, \"Descripción de los reinos, Libro que trata del descubrimiento y principio del estrecho que se llama de Magallanes, por Ginés de Mafra\", published in Madrid, 1920 in \"Tres Relaciones\" could not be based on more than Mafra's memory of what he might have read in a Tratado begun by San Martín.\" This dismissive charge unargued, and unproved, was echoed by Martín Torodash, and Philippine religious historian John N. Schumacher, and influenced the thinking of many other scholars including the ethnographer historian William H. Scott. This explains why the unsolved information to the geographical mystery of Mazaua has remained buried in his record. Laurence Bergreen gave due recognition of de Mafra's document in Bergreen's 2003 work titled \"Over the Edge of the World, Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe\". It is this document that makes his information an incomparably important geographical testimony that unlocks the mystery of the island of Mazaua.\n\nDe Mafra wrote that Magellan's port was an isle with a circumference of 3-4 leagues or 9-12 nautical miles. \"Y otro dia luego partió\" [Magallanes] \"de esta isla, y navegando su viage llego a otra isla que tendra de circuito de tres hasta cuatro leguas\". (\"And after another day he [Magellan] left this island [Homonhon], and sailing on his way arrived at another [Mazaua] three or four leagues in circumference.\") Because the shape of the isle is almost circular, 3-4 leagues translate to an area of from 2,214 up to 3,930 hectares. In contrast, Limasawa is only 698 hectares. He also stated, they anchored west of the isle: \"Esta isla tiene un puerto bueno a la parte del poniente della, y es poblada.\" (\"This island called Mazaua has a good harbor on its western side, and is inhabited\"). Mazaua is officially, by Philippine law, declared as the island of Limasawa, an isle without anchorage, and the port is located east of the island. De Mafra's most clarifying testimony is that Mazaua was 15 leagues, roughly , below Butuan in 1521 which in Pigafetta's map, and text is a larger geographical conception than the present-day map. The land area starts from present day Surigao, and extends all the way to Zamboanga del Norte. De Mafra writes in Spanish: \"De este Señor de Maçagua\" [Rajah Siaiu] \"\"supo Magallanes que en una provincia que se llamaba Butuan que es en la isla de Mindanao que es de la parte del norte della quince leguas de Maçagua habia gran cantidad de oro.\" \" (\"From the chief of Mazaua\" Rajah Siaiu \"Magellan learned that a province called Butuan, on the island of Mindanao, which is somewhere fifteen leagues to the north of Mazaua, possessed a large quantity of gold.\") This puts the port of Mazaua at 9° N, the exact latitude for it by the Genoese Pilot, one of those who wrote an eyewitness document. All these information revolutionize geographical conception of Mazaua. Limasawa, which has been affirmed thrice by the Philippines' National Historical Institute, to be Mazaua is rectangular in shape, 698 hectares in area, and is reached by a track that is not drawn by any of the document. What is most telling is that Limasawa has no anchorage, As stated by the coast pilot, \"Limasawa is fringed by a narrow, steep-to reef, off which the depths are too great to afford anchorage for large vessels.\"\n\nArmed with the insight from De Mafra's information, a team of archaeologists led by a geomorphologist went to work to validate the theory Mazaua is in 9°N. In January 2001, an incredible discovery met the earth scientists: the geo-political entities composed of Pinamanculan and Bancasi inside Butuan in northern Mindanao was in fact an island. From that point on the archaeologists went to work to find artefacts that would identify the isle as the port of Magellan. Age of contact ceramics, disarticulated human bones have been found that show the isle was inhabited before the Spanish arrival. Corroded iron, metal bracelets, and a brass pestle have been dug up that however have yet to be dated. The excavation was done in places outside the suspected village where the indigenous tribes of Mazaua had lived.\n\nHowever scientists have not yet examined the entire isle including its coastal regions. At the moment no authenticated physical evidence traceable to Magellan and De Mafra and other known European visitors who visited the island-port has been found. As of today, geologists and archaeologists are still digging and investigating the site.\n\n\n"}

He is mainly known for his works in metaphysics and for his theory of language.\n\nGéraud de Cordemoy was born in a family of ancient nobility coming from Auvergne (from the town of Royat). He was the third of four children. His father was a master in arts at the University of Paris named Géraud de Cordemoy who died when he was nine years old. His mother was named Nicole de Cordemoy. As for Géraud, he was a private tutor and a linguist and practised as a lawyer.\n\nGéraud de Cordemoy used to haunt the philosophical circles of the capital; he made acquaintance with Emmanuel Maignan and Jacques Rohault. A friend and a protégé of Bossuet who admired Descartes too, Géraud de Cordemoy was appointed \"lecteur\" (tutor) to the Dauphin (son of King Louis XIV), at the same time as Fléchier. He was elected a member of Académie française in 1675.\n\nCordemoy is known primarily for having rethought the Cartesian theory of causality, introducing the notion of \"occasional cause\" within a system of thought which remains essentially Cartesian. He was, alongside Arnold Geulincx and Louis de La Forge, the founder of what is called \"occasionalism\". Body and soul are distinct by essence, their combination is occasional, and it is God who allows that the will to move my arm, for example, is translated into a movement. My will is an occasional cause of the movement of my arm, God is the real cause of it. What is true for the body-an individual constituted by the distinct combination of body and soul- is true for every body in the universe. God is the real and universal cause of every movement.\n\nBy body, Cordemoy means the ultimate components of matter. Using a judicial figure of speech, he shows that the body, in law a person, in physics an ultimate component of matter, is indivisible. Never mentioning atomism, with that theory he comes close to the followers of Gassendi and to the free thinkers, the so-called Libertines. In his work \"Le discernement du corps et de l’âme\" (Discrimination between body and soul) he develops such thoughts which were criticized at that time by the followers of Descartes.\n\nIn his work \"Discours physique de la parole\" (Physical Discourse on Speech), he asks himself the following question: \"How can I, as a thinking being, be certain that the human beings who surround me are also thinking beings, and not simple automatons? The problem is considered at the end of the sixth speech on discrimination between body and soul. It is the word as a vehicle of the thought which will enable me to know the existence of other individuals who are endowed with a soul like me.\" In a more original way, in his work \"Traité physique de la parole\"( physical treatise of the word)- a variation of the previous title - he develops the notion that no motivated relation between the material sign and the expressed idea exists, as much as no real relation exists between body and soul. The word represents the opportunity for sign and meaning to meet, so far as if the soul hadn’t the use of the articulated body to produce sign, it would communicate in a much more immediate way from soul to soul, without having to go through the institution of the sign.\n\nThe language used by human beings is therefore too complex to be explained by purely mechanical causes; I can deduce from it that the bodies I can see are also endowed with a soul. Animals may utter sounds and parrots may reproduce words, only human beings are able to communicate ideas, and that shows the presence of a rational soul. This rational soul is able to communicate directly with angels without going through the physical articulation of the sign. \"Le Discours\", from which Molière drew the scene of the spelling lesson in \"Le Bourgeois gentilhomme\", remains the most successful work of Cordemoy. American linguists such as George Boas and Noam Chomsky rediscovered him during the sixties.\n\nCordemoy is also known for his \"Histoire de France\" on which he worked for 18 years without ever seeing the end, so major were the contradictions he came up against while consulting the works of his predecessors. The work was finally finished by his elder son, Louis-Géraud de Cordemoy, and published after his death. Voltaire said of the work of Cordemoy as a historian : \"He was the first to be able to disentangle the chaos of the two first races of the kings of France; thanks to the duke of Montausier who charged Cordemoy with the writing of the history of Charlemagne in view of the education of \"Monseigneur\" [the Dauphin], that useful work was achieved. He found in ancient authors nothing but absurdities and contradictions. That very difficulty encouraged him, and enabled him to disentangle the two first races\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "140742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140742", "title": "Joannes Zonaras", "text": "Joannes Zonaras\n\nJoannes or John Zonaras (, \"Iōánnēs Zōnarâs\"; fl. 12th century) was a Byzantine chronicler and theologian who lived in Constantinople. Under Emperor Alexios I Komnenos he held the offices of head justice and private secretary (\"protasēkrētis\") to the emperor, but after Alexios' death, he retired to the monastery in the Island of Hagia Glykeria, (Incir Ada, in the Aegean Sea), where he spent the rest of his life writing books.\n\nHis most important work, \"Extracts of History\" (, ), in eighteen books, extends from the creation of the world to the death of Alexius (1118). The earlier part is largely drawn from Josephus; for Roman history he chiefly followed Cassius Dio up to the early third century. Contemporary scholars are particularly interested in his account of the third and fourth centuries, which depend upon sources, now lost, whose nature is fiercely debated. Central to this debate is the work of Bruno Bleckmann, whose arguments tend to be supported by continental scholars but rejected in part by English-speaking scholars. An English translation of these important sections has recently been published: Thomas Banchich and Eugene Lane, \"The History of Zonaras from Alexander Severus to the Death of Theodosius the Great\" (Routledge 2009). The chief original part of Zonaras' history is the section on the reign of Alexios I Komnenos, whom he criticizes for the favour shown to members of his family, to whom Alexios entrusted vast estates and significant state offices. His history was continued by Nicetas Acominatus.\n\nVarious ecclesiastical works have been attributed to Zonaras — commentaries on the Church Fathers and the poems of Gregory of Nazianzus; lives of Saints; and a treatise on the Apostolic Canons — and there is no reason to doubt their genuineness. The lexicon, however, which has been handed down under his name (ed. J. A. H. Tittmann 1808) is probably the work of a certain Antonius Monachus (Stein's Herodotus, ii. 479 f).\n\nThe first ecclesiastical denunciation of the game of chess on the part of the Eastern Orthodox Church was voiced by Zonaras. It was during his retirement as a monk to the monastery of Mount Athos that he wrote his commentary on the canons of the Eastern Church. The Quinisext Council required both clergy and laity to give up the use of dice (Canon 50). Zonaras wanted chess to also be included for clergy and laity to give up. Zonaras, commenting on Canon 50, wrote, \"Because there are some of the Bishops and clergy who depart from virtue and play chess (\"zatikron\") or dice or drink to excess, the Rule commands that such shall cease to do so or be excluded; and if a Bishop or elder or deacon or subdeacon or reader or singer do not cease so to do, he shall be cast out: and if laymen be given to chess-playing and drunkenness, they shall be excluded.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36706323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36706323", "title": "Kashubian diaspora", "text": "Kashubian diaspora\n\nThe Kashubian diaspora resulted from the emigration of Kashubians, in two waves occurring in the second half of the 19th century. The majority of Kashubian emigrants settled in the United States; others emigrated to Canada and Brazil. An online genealogical project, \"The Great Kashubian Migration,\" is devoted to tracking their settlement patterns. Their reasons for emigration varied. Until the Franco-Prussian War, Kashubians emigrated primarily for economic reasons. After the Franco-Prussian War and especially due to the Kulturkampf, Kashubian emigration accelerated as socio-political factors came into play. In his 1899 book, \"Statystyka ludnosci kaszubskiej\" (\"Statistics of the Kashubian Population\"), the Kashubophile linguist and sociologist Stefan Ramult estimated that 130,700 Kashubians were living in the Americas.\n\nThe primary reason for emigration was economic. Kashubian farmers were not targeted by Prussian laws immediately after 1850. As the eminent Kashubian scholar, Professor Józef Borzyszkowski of Gdańsk University has observed, Kashubians were more or less comfortable with Prussian governance at the time. Rather, smallholders of all ethnicities were disadvantaged because the greater part of arable Pomeranian land already belonged to estate owners, and what remained was not particularly fertile. Another problem was the population boom among the Kashubians and Poles. Large families were typical of devout Roman Catholics, and in this particular case children were welcomed as additional workers. Once grown to maturity, however, the surfeit of young people were a further drain upon Pomerania's already strained fortunes. Recognizing this situation, the Prussian government tried to free up land by encouraging (but not forcing) Kashubians and Poles to emigrate. One very early incentive was inexpensive or even free travel to North America.\n\nIn the wake of the Franco-Prussian War and the unification of Germany, Kashubians and Poles met with institutionalized hostility. The Kulturkampf brought further indignities. It became illegal to use the Polish (and by default, the Kashubian) languages in public, including (or especially) church. By this time, too, the first wave of Kashubian emigrants had formed viable communities in towns such as Wilno (Ontario), Winona (Minnesota), and Stevens Point and Pine Creek (Wisconsin). Letters and remittances flowed from the contented North American immigrants, encouraging more Kashubians to try their chances in the West. One particular selling point was the availability of homesteads. Many emigrated; more, in fact, than the Kashubian immigrant communities could effectively absorb. As the Kashubian community within Germany became more self-aware (thanks to figures such as Florian Ceynowa and Aleksander Majkowski) it became more resilient in contending with the Germans; another result of the Kulturkampf was that Kashubians were more likely to make common cause with Poles. The primary sources of the twentieth-century Polish emigration boom were the Austrian and Russian zones of occupation.\n\nBeginning around 1855, the Kashubian diaspora predated by at least 10 years the onset of the Polish American diaspora, which is typically dated to between 1865 and 1870. The first wave of Kashubian emigrants tended to sail from Hamburg to either New York City or Quebec. They emigrated in extended family groups that replicated themselves in North America. Portage County, Wisconsin's first Kashubian settlers, the Koziczkowski family, arrived in the fall of 1857. Renfrew County, Ontario's first Kashubian settlers are said to have arrived in 1858. The families that settled in Portage County and in Renfrew County quickly established farming settlements: Polonia, Wisconsin and Wilno, Ontario. Winona, Minnesota's first Kashubian settlers, the Józef Bronk family, are believed to have reached that community in 1859. The group of emigrants that came to Winona had trouble finding farmland in the immediate vicinity; consequently in 1862 the satellite hamlet of Pine Creek was founded about 10 miles away, across the Mississippi River in Trempealeau County, Wisconsin. The two communities remain closely tied to this day, leading to Winona's status as the \"Kashubian capital of America.\"\n\nThe pace of Kashubian emigration picked up as the Kulturkampf gathered force. 1872 saw the founding of a small Kashubian community on Jones Island in Milwaukee's harbor by Kashubian immigrant Jacob Muza. Unfortunately, the harbor land was too valuable and the Kashubians had never acquired title: the last Kashubian settler was forced out in 1944. In the middle 1880s, a Kashubian enclave formed in the Chicago neighborhood of Lincoln Park, and the parish of Saint Josaphat was established there in 1884. In 1902, a huge new Romanesque church was completed there. In Winona, the Kashubian community attained such a size that in 1894 the Roman Catholic parish of Saint Stanislaus Kostka had to level its old sanctuary and build a new one seating 1800 worshipers. Since jobs in Winona's dwindling sawmill industry were in short supply, many of the newer immigrants proceeded west to newer Kashubian settlements in eastern South Dakota, western Minnesota and eastern North Dakota. Toward the turn of the century, minor Kashubian settlements were established in western North Dakota and eastern Montana.\n\nRamult's chapter on Kashubians in the United States was contributed by Hieronim Derdowski, the Kashubian poet and editor of the Polish-American newspaper Wiarus, who broke down America's population of 90,700 Kashubians state by state:\nThe Kashubian community of Canada, which Ramult estimated at 25,000 people, is centered in Renfrew County, Ontario, and Brazil's Kashubian population, which Ramult estimated at 15,000, is mostly located in the state of Parana.\n"}

An Athabascan village that was established on the shores of Lake Clark in the Alaska Range, its population was recorded at 91 in the 1880 United States Census and declined thereafter, falling to approximately 25 individuals by 1904. Today, the village has been abandoned. The ghost town is located within the bounds of Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.\n\nThe historic portion of the village was the subject of archaeological and ethnological research in the 1960s. Interviews with Dena'ina elders in Nondalton established that the people of Kijik relocated to Old Nondalton (not far from present-day Nondalton) in the early 19th century, probably to be closer to trading posts and the canneries of Bristol Bay. A survey expedition that visited the site in 1909 reported it to be abandoned. A major archaeological excavation of the historic village took place in 1966, exposing twelve foundational remnants of log houses (many of the houses having apparently been moved to Old Nondalton at the time of the relocation), and two of what appeared to be larger communal structures.\n\nIn 1979, twelve acres of the village site were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.

{"id": "40966270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40966270", "title": "Kosovo Myth", "text": "Kosovo Myth\n\nThe Kosovo Myth, or the Kosovo Cult () is a traditional belief of the Serb people asserting that the Battle of Kosovo (June 1389) symbolizes a martyrdom of the Serbian nation in defense of their honor and Christendom against Turks (non-believers). The essence of the myth is that during the battle, Serbs, headed by Prince Lazar, lost because they consciously sacrificed the earthly kingdom (Serbian Empire) in order to gain the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nThe legend evolved slowly through chronicles and particularly the oral tradition of Serbs. Since the 19th century period of national revivals in Europe, the Kosovo Myth became an important constitutive element of ethnic identity, as well as cultural and political homogenization of Serbs, and later of members of other South Slavic nations (Yugoslavs). The basic elements of the Kosovo Myth are vengeance, martyrdom, betrayal and glory. This myth dominated political discourse in Serbia until the end of the 20th century. The Kosovo myth is incorporated into the Serb national identity's multifaceted mythomoteur.\n\nSince its establishment at the end of the 14th century, the Kosovo Myth and its poetic, literary, religious, and philosophical exposition was intertwined with political and ideological agendas. The mythologization of the battle occurred shortly after the event. The legend of Kosovo was not created immediately after the battle but evolved from different originators into various versions. The Kosovo Myth existed in the Serbian oral tradition for centuries, until it was recorded by early collectors like Vuk Karadžić and evoked at times of later major historic events such as the Balkan Wars, the First World War and by Slobodan Milošević at the end of the 1980s.\n\n \n\nThe essence of this myth is the struggle for freedom through the defense of Christianity and the establishment of the free state. Its basic elements are:\n\nThe Kosovo Myth presents the battle as \"a titanic contest between Christian Europe and the Islamic East\" in which Tsar Lazar renounced \"the earthly kingdom for a heavenly one\". Although Serbia's strategic fall was the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, Kosovo was the spiritual fall of Serbia and a beginning of a new era for the Serbs. The real battle was not as decisive as presented by this myth because the final downfall of medieval Serbia happened 70 years after it, in 1459, when the Ottomans captured Smederevo.\n\nThe Kosovo Myth pictures Serbia as \"Antemurale Christianitatis\" (Bulwark of Christianity), similarly to constructions of the other nations in the Balkans. It is sometimes propagated to evoke a sense of pride and national grievance among Serbs.\n\nThe scale of interpretations of the Kosovo Myth is undeniably one of the richest. It can be interpreted as \"democratic, anti-feudal, with a love for justice and social equality\". The myth can be interpreted in different ways in connection with other myths like: myth of military valor, myth of victimhood, myth of salvation and myth of chosen people.\n\nOral epic poetry and folk songs cultivated the Kosovo Myth. Medieval church writers portrayed Prince Lazar as a servant of God whose death was martyrdom for the faith, while Serbs are portrayed as \"heavenly people\" who defended Christianity against Islam. Military defeat in the Kosovo Battle was portrayed as moral victory. The centrality of the Kosovo Myth was one of the main causes for merging ethnic and Orthodox Christian religious identity of Serbs.\n\nThe Kosovo Myth is the central myth of Serbian nationalism used since the 19th century to legitimize the intention of the Serbian nationalistic movement to create an independent national state.\n\nThe Kosovo Myth was often used to create a Serbian victimization narrative. This myth and its connection to the Serbian victim-centered position was used to legitimize reincorporation of Kosovo into Serbia. The Kosovo Myth was activated and linked to the metaphors of 'genocide'. Albanians from Kosovo were accused of genocide (killing and forcible expulsion) of Kosovo Serbs since the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. Islamized Albanians were presented as violent and treacherous people who were settled in Kosovo to collaborate with Ottoman occupiers and terrorize Christian Serbs. This centuries-long genocide of Serbs continued in the 19th century through the forcible expulsion of up to 150,000 Serbs, and also in Tito's Yugoslavia, 'morally disqualified' Albanians to claim any control of Kosovo at the expense of Serbs.\n\nThere was a deep belief among Montenegrins that they descended from Serb knights who fled after the battle and settled in the unreachable mountains. The Kosovo Myth was present among the people in Montenegro before the time of Njegoš, in the form of folk legends and especially folk songs.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, with the Yugoslav idea spreading, it also became a trope in common culture of Croats and Slovenes. Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović contributed to the Kosovo Myth when in 1907–11, he was commissioned to design the Vidovdan Temple as \"the eternal ideal of heroism, loyalty and sacrifice, from which our race draws its faith and moral strength\" and \"collective ideal of the Serbian people\". The temple's actual construction on the Field of Kosovo was postponed because of the Balkan Wars, World War I, World War II, and eventually shelved. Mirko Rački, also adopted the mythos and painted numerous paintings within Kosovo cycle, including \"The Mother of the Jugović\", \"Nine Jugović brothers\", \"Kosovo Maiden\" and \"Miloš Obilić\".\n\nKosovo was particularly present in the public opinion of Great Britain during the First World War where 28 June was proclaimed \"Kossovo Day\". Manifestations were held across the country. The Kosovo cycle epic folk poems were several times published in France during the war while some French authors emphasized that Kosovo Myth is important to strengthen \"the energy for revenge\".\n\nLeading up to the Kosovo War, the contemporary Kosovo Albanian political mythology clashed with the Kosovo Myth.\n\n\n"}

Alexander Gumby\n\nLevi Sandy Alexander Gumby (February 1, 1885 – March 16, 1961) was an African-American archivist and historian. His collection of 300 scrapbooks documenting African-American history have been part of the collection of Columbia University since 1950 as the \"Alexander Gumby Collection of Negroiana\". Gumby was also the proprietor of a popular bookstore during the Harlem Renaissance, where he was host of a salon. Gumby's passion for collecting earned him the nicknames \"The Count\" and \"Mr. Scrapbook\".\n\nBorn in Maryland, Gumby was the son of an evangelist, Levi Thomas Gumby, and his wife, Louisa Morris. He and his sister were sent to live with their grandparents in 1901. Gumby studied law at Dover State College in Delaware at the behest of his grandmother, but feeling his inadequacy in law he moved to New York City, which would be his home until his death. Gumby embraced life in New York, saying in his 1952 essay \"The Adventures of My Scrapbook\" that \"At once I became a New Yorker in spirit and principle for I found here more freedom of action than I had ever known before\". Six of his scrapbooks are autobiographical, labelled \"Gumby's Autobiography\".\n\nIn his early days in New York, Gumby took a number of minor jobs to support his collecting, working as a butler to a banker, a bellhop, and a postal worker during World War I. Gumby also founded the Southern Utopia Fraternity, an organization to support young men who came from the Southern States to New York in search of work and opportunities.\n\nGumby was forced to abandon his bookshop as a result of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and was admitted to hospital as a result of the loss of his studio and fatigue, and spent four years in hospitals on North Brother Island and Randall's Island on New York City's East River.\n\nWorking as a waiter at Columbia University, Gumby began fraternizing with academia and students. He would eventually leave his collection to Columbia, and was hired by the university to organize the collection for eight months. He added to it until his death from tuberculosis.\n\nIn the 1920s Gumby received financial assistance to help compile his collection from Charles W. Newman, a wealthy stockbroker. With Newman's help Gumby moved his collection to a large studio at 2144 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan's Harlem district, that became known as \"Gumby's Bookstore\". His book studio became an important gathering place for the figures of the Harlem Renaissance.\n\nThe book studio served as a workspace to compile the collection as well as an exhibition space, and an artistic and intellectual salon. Due to the imperious nature with which he conducted his salon he was nicknamed \"The Great God Gumby\". Gumby also produced the \"Gumby Book Studio Quarterly\", a literary journal that was only published for a single issue, and was never distributed.\n\nThrough his studio, Gumby became acquainted with such notable Harlem Renaissance figures as Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, Rose McClendon, Evelyn Ellis, Paul Robeson, Alain LeRoy Locke, Robert Schlick, Heywood Broun, H. L. Mencken, O. Richard Reid, Aaron Douglas, Dorothy West, Helene Johnson, Augusta Savage, Richard Bruce Nugent and Arthur Fauset. In many cases, Gumby was the only person to keep these documents years after the events occurred. One example is a short series of letters on \"Our National Capital,\" a speech given by Frederick Douglass. The letters were written between Grace Greenwood and Douglass himself.\n\nCharles W. Newman, Gumby's financial backer, was badly affected by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and Gumby's studio lost the support of its regular patrons. The Wall Street Crash forced Gumby to abandon his studio and sell many of his precious editions, and store his scrapbooks in the cellar of a friend's house.\n\nGumby was openly gay, and his book studio became a gathering place for the LGBT community in Harlem. He was described as a \"dandy\" and a \"Social Butterfly\", his style being described by Nugent as \"Fancy clothes, a perennial walking stick, pale yellow kid gloves, and a diamond stick-pin made him the Beau Brummell of his particular little group\".\n\nIn September 1901, aged 16, Gumby made his first scrapbook with clippings concerning the assassination of President McKinley.\nGumby had organized his clippings by 1910, and took his archival work seriously, visiting similar collections in libraries across the United States and Canada. Gumby also became acquainted with fellow African-American archivist, Arturo Alfonso Schomburg.\nWorking as a waiter at Columbia University Gumby began fraternizing with academia and students, adding clippings to his collection about popular professors and Columbia's president, Nicholas Murray Butler. In 1925 Gumby's collection so crowded his 2½ rooms that he was forced to lease the entire second-floor unpartitioned apartment of the house in which he lived. Gumby initially found it easy to acquire his collection as \"Negro\" items were considered of little interest to book dealers.\n\nThe scrapbooks contain autographed photos, stories and letters from such notable performers as Paul Robeson, Josephine Baker, Langston Hughes, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie and Ethel Waters, and letters and autographs from Black historical figures such as Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, Father Divine, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Marcus Garvey.\n\nGumby kept collecting while hospitalized, including articles about his hospitalization, get-well cards and photographs of friends who visited him. Upon his release from hospital Gumby retrieved and began restoring his collection, and continued to add to them. In 1950 Gumby donated his collection to Columbia University and in 1951, Columbia hired him for eight months to help organize the collections. Gumby continued to add to his scrapbooks until his death from complications from tuberculosis in 1961. The 300 scrapbooks are part of Columbia's Rare Book and Manuscript Library in Butler Library as the \"Alexander Gumby Collection of Negroiana\".\n\nIn the early 1920s he exhibited his collections in cities along the East Coast of America, and was subsequently included in the 1922 edition of the Private Book Collectors' Who's Who.\n\nGumby said of his collection that it \"... could well be called 'The Unwritten History ... There are so many surprising and startling historical events pertaining to, or relating to the American Negro that are not recorded in the Standard Histories, dictionaries and school text-books, or if so, they are shaded so that they sound like a Ripley's 'Believe It or Not.'\" A variety of different formats make up the scrapbooks including newspaper stories and magazine articles, and autographs, letters, photos, theatre programmes and documents concerning slavery. The scrapbooks have subsequently been converted to microfilm.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10323935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10323935", "title": "Parametric determinism", "text": "Parametric determinism\n\nParametric determinism is a Marxist interpretation of the course of history. It was formulated by Ernest Mandel and can be viewed as one variant of Karl Marx's historical materialism or as a philosophy of history.\n\nIn an article critical of the analytical Marxism of Jon Elster, Mandel explains the idea as follows:\n\nIn formal-logical determinism, human action is considered \"either\" rational, and hence logically explicable, \"or else\" arbitrary and random (in which case human actions can be comprehended at best only as patterns of statistical distributions, i.e. as degrees of variability relative to some constants). But in dialectical determinism, human action may be \"non-arbitrary\" and \"determinate\", hence reasonable, even although it is \"not\" explicable exclusively in terms of deductive inference. The action selected by people from a limited range of options may not be the \"most logical\" or \"most optimal\" one, but it can be shown to be \"non-arbitrary\" and \"reasonable\" under the circumstances, if the total context is considered.\n\nWhat this means is that, in human situations, typically \"several \"logics\" are operating at the same time\" which together determine the outcomes of those situations:\n\n\nIf one considered only one of these aspects, one might judge people's actions \"irrational\", but if all three aspects are taken into account, what people do may appear \"very reasonable\". Dialectical theory aims to demonstrate this, by linking different \"logical levels\" together as a total picture, in a non-arbitrary way. \"Different logical levels\" means that particular determinants regarded as irrelevant at one level of analysis are excluded, but are relevant and included at another level of analysis with a somewhat different (or enlarged) set of assumptions.—depending on the kind of problem being investigated.\n\nFor example, faced with a situation, the language which people use to talk about it, reveals that they can jump very quickly from one context to another related context, knowing very well that at least some of the inferences that can be drawn in the one context are not operative in the other context. That's because they know that the assumptions in one context differ to some degree from the other. Nevertheless, the two contexts can coexist, and can be contained in the same situation, which we can demonstrate by identifying the mediating links. This is difficult to formalize precisely, yet people do it all the time, and think it perfectly \"reasonable\". For another example, people will say \"you can only understand this if you are in the situation yourself\" or \"on the ground.\" What they mean is that the meaning of the totality of interacting factors involved can only be understood by experiencing them. Standing outside the situation, things seem irrational, but being there, they appear very reasonable.\n\nDialectical theory does not mean that, in analyzing the complexity of human action, inconvenient facts are simply and arbitrarily set aside. It means, rather, that those facets of the subjectmatter which are not \"logically required\" at a given stage of the analysis are set aside. Yet, and this is the point, as the analysis progresses, the previously disregarded aspects are integrated step by step into the analysis, in a consistent way. The proof of the validity of the procedure is that, at the end, the theory has made the subjectmatter fully self-explanatory, since all salient aspects have been given their appropriate place in the theory, so that all of it becomes comprehensible, without resort to shallow tautologies. This result can obviously be achieved only after the research has already been done, and the findings can be arranged in a convincing way. A synthesis cannot be achieved without a preceding analysis. So dialectical analysis is not a \"philosopher's stone\" that provides a quick short-cut to the \"fount of wisdom\", but a mode of presenting findings of the analysis after knowledge has been obtained through inquiry and research, and dialectical relationships have been verified. Because only then does it become clear where the story should begin and end, so that all facets are truly explained. According to Ernest Mandel, \"Marx's method is much richer than the procedures of ' successive concretization' or 'approximation' typical of academic science.\"\n\nIn mainstream social theory, the problem of \"several logics\" in human action is dealt with by game theory, a kind of modelling which specifies the choices and options which actors have within a defined setting, and what the effects are of their decisions. The main limitation of that approach is, that the model is only as good as the assumptions on which it is based, while the choice of assumptions is often eclectic or fairly arbitrary. Dialectical theory attempts to overcome this problem, by paying attention to the sources of assumptions, and by integrating the assumptions in a consistent way.\n\nOne common problem in historical analysis is to understand to what extent the results of human actions can be attributed to free choices and decisions people made (or free will), and to what extent they are a product of social or natural forces beyond their control.\n\nTo solve this problem theoretically, Mandel suggests that in almost any human situation, some factors (\"parameters\") are beyond the control of individuals, while some other conditions are under their control (arguably, one group of people could \"impose parameters\" on another, analogous to parents imposing constraints on children). Some things can under the circumstances be changed by human action, according to choice, but others cannot or will not be, and can thus be regarded as constants. A variable can vary, yet it cannot vary in any direction whatever but only within the given parameters. In a general sense, a \"parameter\" is a given condition imposed on a situation, or a controlled variable, but more specifically it refers to a condition which, in some way, \"limits the amount and type of variability there can be\".\n\nThose given, objective parameters which are beyond people's control (and thus cannot normally be changed by them) \"limit\" the realm of possibilities in the future; they \"rule out\" some conceivable future developments or alternatively make them \"more likely to happen\". In that sense human action is \"determined\" and \"determinate\". If that wasn't so, then it would be impossible to predict anything much about human behaviour.\n\nSome of these parameters refer to limits imposed by the physical world, others to limits imposed by the social set-up or social structure that individuals and groups operate within. The dominant ideology or religion could also be a given parameter. If for example most people follow a certain faith, this shapes their whole cultural life, and is something to be reckoned with that isn't easily changed.\n\nAt the same time, however, the given parameters cannot usually determine \"in total\" what an individual or group will do, because they have at least some (and sometimes a great deal) of personal or behavioural autonomy. They can think about their situation, and make some free choices and decisions about what they will do, within the framework of what is objectively possible for them (the choices need not be \"rational\" or \"fully conscious\" ones, they could just be \"non-arbitrary\" choices influenced by emotions and desires). Sentient (self-aware) organisms, of which human beings are the most evolved sort, are able to vary their own response to given situations according to internally evaluated and decided options.\n\nIn this sense, Karl Marx had written:\n\n\"The past\" (what really happened before, as distinct from its results in the present) is not something which can be changed at all in the present, only reinterpreted, and therefore the past is a given constant which delimits what can possibly happen in the present and in the future. If the future seems relatively \"open-ended\" that is just because in the time-interval between now and the future, new options and actions could significantly alter what exactly the future will be. Yet the variability of possible outcomes in the future is not infinite, but delimited by what happened before.\n\nTen implications of this view are as follows:\n\nAccording to the theory of parametric determinism, the \"human problem\" in this context is usually not that human beings lack free choice or free will, or that they cannot in principle change their situation (at least to some extent), but rather is their \"awareness\" of the options open to them, and their \"belief\" in their own ability to act on them—influenced as they may be, by their ideology, experience and emotions.\n\nPerceptions of what people can change or act upon may vary a great deal, they might overestimate it, or underestimate it. Thus it may take scientific inquiry to find out what perceptions are realistic. By discovering what the determinism is, we can learn better how we can be free. Simply put, we could \"bang our head against a wall\", but we could also go over the wall, through a door in the wall, or around the wall. At crucial points, humans can \"make history\" actively with a high awareness of what they are doing, changing the course of history, but they can also \"be made by history\" to the extent that they passively conform to (or are forced to conform to) a situation which is mostly not of their own making and which they may not understand.\n\nAs regards the latter, Mandel referred to the condition of alienation in the sense of a diminished belief in the ability to have control over one's own life, or feeling estranged from one's real nature and purpose in life. People might reify aspects of their situation. They might regard something as inevitable (\"God's will\") or judge \"nothing could be done to prevent it\" when the real point is that, for specific reasons, nobody was prepared to do anything about it—something could have been done, but it wasn't. Thus \"historical inevitability\" can also be twisted into a convenient apology to justify a course of events.\n\nIn this process of making choices within a given objective framework of realistic options, plenty of illusions are also possible, insofar as humans may have all kinds of gradations of (maybe false) awareness about their true situation. They may, as Mandel argues, not even be fully aware of what motivates their own actions, quite aside from not knowing fully what the consequences of their actions will be. A revolutionary seeking to overthrow the old order to make way for a new one obviously faces many \"unknowns\".\n\nTherefore, human action can have \"unintended consequences\", including effects which are completely opposite to what was intended. This means that popular illusions can also shape the outcomes of historical events. If most people believe something to be the case, even although it is not true, this fact can also become a parameter limiting what can happen or influencing what will happen.\n\nBecause terrible illusions can occur, some historians are skeptical about the ability of people to change the world for the better in any real and lasting way. Postmodernism casts doubt on the existence of progress in history as such—if e.g. Egyptians built the Great Pyramid of Giza in 2500 BC, and Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong landed on the moon in 1969, this represents no progress for humanity.\n\nHowever, Mandel argued that this skepticism is itself based on perceptions of what people are able to know about their situation and their history. Ultimately, the skeptic believes that it is impossible for people to have sufficient knowledge of a kind that they can really change the human condition for the better, except perhaps in very small ways. It just is what it is. This skeptical view does not necessarily imply a very \"deterministic\" view of history however; history could also be viewed as an unpredictable chaos or too complex to fathom.\n\nHowever, most politicians and political activists (including Mandel himself) at least do not believe that history generally is an unpredictable chaos, because in that case their own standpoints would be purely arbitrary and be \"perceived\" as purely arbitrary. Usually, they would argue, the chaos is limited in space and time, because in perpetual chaos, human life can hardly continue anyway; in that case, people become reactive beasts. Since people mostly do want to survive, they need some order and predictability. One can understand what really happened in history reasonably well, if one tries. Human beings can understand human experience because they are human, and the more relevant experience they obtain, the better they can understand it.\n\nConscious human action, Mandel argues, is mainly non-arbitrary and practical, it has a certain \"logic\" to it even if people are not (yet) fully aware of this. The reality they face is \"ordered\" in basic ways, and therefore can be meaningfully understood. Masses of people might go into a \"mad frenzy\" sometimes that might be difficult to explain in rational terms, but this is the exception, not the rule. What is true is that a situation of chaos and disorder (when nothing in society seems to work properly anymore) can powerfully accentuate the irrational and non-rational aspects of human behaviour. In such situations, people with very unreasonable ideas can rise to power. This is, according to Mandel, part of the explanation of fascism.\n\nThe concept of parametric determinism has as its corollary the concept of \"historical latency\". It is not just that different historical outcomes are possible, but that each epoch of human history contains quite a few different developmental \"potentials\". The indications of these potentials can be empirically identified, and are not simply a speculation about \"what could conceivably happen\".\n\nBut they are \"latent\" factors in the situation, insofar as they will not necessarily be realised or actualised. Their realisation depends on human action, on the recognition of the potential that is there, and the decision to do something about it. Thus, Mandel argues that both socialism and barbarism exist as broad \"latent\" developmental possibilities within modern capitalist society, even if they are not realised, and whether and which of these will be realised, depends on human choices and human actions.\n\nEffective action to change society, he argues, has to set out from the real possibilities there are for an alternative way of doing things, not from abstract speculations about a better world. Some things are realistically possible, but not just \"anything\" is possible. The analytical challenge—often very difficult—is therefore to understand correctly what the real possibilities are, and which course of action would have the most fruitful effect. One can do only what one is able to do and no more, but much depends on choices about how to spend one's energies.\n\nTypically in wars and revolutions, when people exert themselves to the maximum and have to improvise, it is discovered that people can accomplish far more than they previously thought they could do (also captured in the saying \"necessity is the mother of invention\"). The whole way people think is suddenly changed. But in times of cultural pessimism, general exhaustion prevails and people are generally skeptical or cynical about their ability to achieve or change very much at all. If the bourgeoisie beats down the workers and constrains their freedom, so that workers have to work more and harder for less and less pay, pessimistic moods can prevail for quite some time. If, on the other hand, the bourgeois economy is expanding, the mood of society can become euphoric, and people believe that just about anything is possible. A famous leftwing slogan in May 1968 was \"tout est possible\" (\"anything is possible\"). Similarly, in the boom of the later 1990s, many people in rich countries believed that all human problems could finally be resolved.\n\nThat is just to say that what is possible to achieve can be both pessimistically underestimated and optimistically exaggerated at any time. Truly conservative people will emphasize how little potential there is for change, while rebels, visionaries, progressives and revolutionaries will emphasize how much could be changed. An important role for social scientific inquiry and historiography is therefore to relativise all this, and place it in a more objective perspective by looking at the relevant facts.\n\nWhile Mandel himself made some successful predictions about the future of world society (for instance, he is famous for predicting at the beginning of the 1960s, like Milton Friedman did, that the postwar economic boom would end at the close of the decade), his Trotskyist critics (including his biographer Jan Willem Stutje) argue, with the benefit of hindsight, that he was far too optimistic and hopeful about the possibility of a workers' revolution in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union during the Mikhail Gorbachev era and after—and more generally, that his historical optimism distorted his political perspectives, so that he became too \"certain\" about a future that he could not be so certain about, or else crucially ambivalent.\n\nThis is arguably a rather shallow criticism insofar as the situation could well have developed in different directions, which is precisely what Mandel himself argued; in politics, one could only try to make the most of the situation at the time, and here pessimism was not conducive to action. But the more substantive criticism is that many of Mandel's future scenarios were simply not realistic, and that in reality things turned out rather differently from what he thought. This raises several questions:\n\n\nIn answering these criticisms, Mandel himself would probably have referred to what he often called the \"laboratory of history\". That is, we can check the historical record, to see who predicted what, the grounds given for the prediction, and the results. On that basis, we can verify empirically what kind of thinking (and what kind of people) will produce the most accurate predictions, and what we can really predict with \"usable accuracy\". One reason why he favoured Marxism was because he believed it provided the best intellectual tools for predicting the future of society. He often cited Leon Trotsky as an example of a good Marxist able to predict the future. Trotsky wrote in 1925 that:\n\nThis may all seem a trivial \"academic\" or \"scholastic\" debate, similar to retrospective speculations about \"what could have been different\", but it has very important implications for the socialist idea of a planned economy. Obviously, if it is not possible to predict much about human behaviour with usable accuracy, then not much economic planning is feasible either—since a plan requires at least some expectation that its result \"can and will be realised in the future\", even if the plan is regularly adjusted for new (and unanticipated) circumstances. In general, Mandel believed that the degree of predictability in human life was very much dependent on the way society itself was organised. If e.g. many producers competed with each other for profits and markets, based on privatized knowledge and business secrets, there was much unpredictability in what would happen. If the producers coordinated their efforts co-operatively, much would be predictable.\n\nA deeper problem, to which Mandel alludes with his book \"Trotsky: A study in the dynamic of his thought\", is that \"if\" we regard certain conditions as possible to change for the better, we \"might\" be able to change them, even if currently people believe it is impossible—whereas if we regard them as unchangeable, we are unlikely to change them at all, even although they could possibly be changed ( a similar insight occurs in pragmatism). That is, we make things possible, by doing something about them rather than do nothing. This, however, implies that even when we try our best to be objective and realistic about history or anything else, we remain subjects influenced by \"subjective perceptions\" or elements of fear, hope, will or faith that defy reason or practicality.\n\nIt is, simply put, very \"difficult\" to bring scientific truths and political action together, as Marxists aim to do, in such a way that we really change the things we can change for the better to the maximum, and do not try to change things we really cannot change anyway (Marxists call this \"the unity of theory and practice\"). In other words, the will to change things can involve subjective perceptions of a kind for which even the best historical knowledge may offer no assistance or guide. And all perceptions of \"history-making\" may inescapably involve ideology, thus—according to skeptics—casting some doubt on the very ability of people to distinguish objectively between what can be changed, and what cannot. The boundary between the two might be rather blurry. This is the basis of Karl Popper's famous philosophy of social change by \"small steps\" only.\n\nMandel's reply to this skepticism essentially was to agree that there were always \"unknowns\" or \"fuzzy\" areas in human experience; for people to accomplish anything at all or \"make their own history\", required taking a risk, calculated or otherwise. One could indeed see one's life as a \"wager\" ultimately staked on a belief, scientifically grounded or otherwise. However, he argued it was one thing to realise all that, but another to say that the \"unknowns\" are \"unknowable\". Thus, for good or for ill, \"you don't know, what you haven't tried\" and more specifically \"you don't know, what you haven't tried to obtain knowledge about\". The limits of knowledge and human possibilities could not be fixed in advance by philosophy; they had to be \"discovered\" through the test of practice. This attitude recalls Marx's famous comment that \"All social life is essentially \"practical\". All mysteries which lead theory to mysticism find their rational solution in human practice, and in the comprehension of this practice.\". Mandel believed, with Marx, that \"ignorance never helped anybody\" except those who profited from its existence (\"never underestimate human gullibility, including your own\").\n\nThe general task of revolutionary science was to overcome ignorance about human life, and this could not very well be done by reconciling people with their allegedly \"predetermined\" fate at every opportunity. We all know we will die eventually, but that says little yet about what we can achieve before that point. Skepticism has its uses, but what those uses are, can only be verified from experience; a universal skepticism would be just as \"arbitrary\" as the belief that \"anything is possible\"—it did not lead to any new experience from which something could be learnt, including learning about the possibilities of human freedom. And such learning could only occur through making conscious choices and decisions within given parameters, i.e. in a \"non-arbitrary\" (non-chaotic) environment, permitting at least some predictability and allowing definite experiential conclusions.\n\nMandel often reiterated that most people do not learn all that much from texts or from history, they learn from their own experience. They might be affected by history without knowing it. But anybody concerned with large-scale social change was almost automatically confronted with the need to place matters in broader historical perspective. One had to understand deeply the limits, consequences and implications of human action. Likewise, politicians making decisions affecting large numbers of people could hardly do without a profound sense of history.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5467262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5467262", "title": "Pedra da Gávea", "text": "Pedra da Gávea\n\nPedra da Gávea is a monolithic mountain in Tijuca Forest, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Composed of granite and gneiss, its elevation is , making it one of the highest mountains in the world that ends directly in the ocean. Trails on the mountain were opened up by the local farming population in the early 1800s; today, the site is under the administration of the Tijuca National Park.\n\nThe mountain's name translates as \"Rock of the Topsail\", and was given to it during the expedition of Captain Gaspar de Lemos, begun in 1501, and in which the Rio de Janeiro bay (today Guanabara Bay, but after which the city was named) also received its name. The mountain, one of the first in Brazil to be named in Portuguese, was named by the expedition's sailors, who compared its silhouette to that of the shape of a topsail of a carrack upon sighting it on January 1, 1502. That name in turn came to be given to the Gávea area of the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nDifferential weathering on one side of the rock has created what is described as a stylized human face. Markings on another face of the rock have been described as an inscription. Geologists and scientists are nearly in agreement that the \"inscription\" is the result of erosion and that the \"face\" is a product of pareidolia. Furthermore, the consensus of archaeologists and scholars in Brazil is that the mountain should not be viewed as an archaeological site.\n\nLocated in the Tijuca Range, Pedra da Gávea is 842 m (2,762 ft) tall, and is a granite dome. The flat top of the mountain is capped with a 150 m tall layer of granite, whereas underneath, the mound is made up of gneiss. The former dates to around 450 million years ago, whereas the latter dates to 600 million years. The mountain, much like other stone outcroppings in and around the area, is the result of younger Neoproterozoic granitoid rocks and thin Cretaceous diabase dikes intruding the older Meso-Neoproterozoic high-grade metasedimentary rocks.\n\nThe contact zone between the upper granite and the lower gneiss is both sub-horizontal and semi-gradual, and the gneissic xenoliths have a tabular form, which heavily suggests that they were captured from a magma chamber’s floor by thermal detachment. It has been suggested that Pedra da Gávea \"correspond[s] to the bottom of a granitic magma chamber and the original thickness of the granitic body was much larger than the present exposure.\" The granitic body of the Pedra da Gávea could also correspond to the eastern extension of the nearby Pedra Branca Granite Massif, according to Akihisa Motoki et al.\n\nDifferential weathering incised the northern side of the mountain, producing cavities underneath the granite dome. The abrupt dome itself is the result of the more durable granite having resisted the aforementioned weathering more so than the softer gneiss. Furthermore, erosion has worn etches into the mountain's sides.\n\nThe mountain is covered in lemon, orange, breadfruit, banana, and papaya trees, as well as cannas and roses.\n\nThere is a purported inscription carved into the rockface, which some claim is in Phoenician, a Semitic language known to modern scholars only from inscriptions. According to Paul Herrmann in his book \"Conquests by Man\", the inscription on the mountain had been known for quite some time, but had merely been attributed to \"some unknown prehistoric American people\". Closer examination, however, led some researchers to believe it was of Phoenician origin. Today, however, most researchers suggest that the inscription and \"face\" are merely the results of erosion. In the mid-1950s, the Brazilian Ministry of Education and Health denied that the site featured any writing, declaring \"that examination by geologists had proved it to be nothing more than the effect of weather erosion which happened to look like an inscription.\" Brazilian archaeologists and scholars have adopted a negative attitude toward the treatment of the site, with Herrmann noting that \"Brazilian archaeology denies altogether the existence of Phoenician inscription in any part of the country whatsoever.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43714648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43714648", "title": "Phum Snay", "text": "Phum Snay\n\nPhum Snay () is an Iron Age archaeological site discovered in May 2000 in Preah Neat Prey District, Banteay Meanchey Province, Northwest Cambodia, around from the temple ruins of Angkor. The site was excavated between 2001 and 2003 by primary excavators Dougald O’Reilly of the Australian National University, Pheng Sitha and Thuy Chanthourn. The excavation was intended to discover more about Iron Age life in Cambodia.\n\nThe site was discovered in 2000 during roadworks, that linked Phum Snay village with National Road 6. Investigations revealed the presence of a number of ancient burials associated with material including bronzes and semiprecious stones. Immediate widespread looting by the local inhabitants over an area of made a full assessment of the extent of the archaeological remains difficult. Excavations started in February 2001 on a 15 x 5 m area.\n\nThe site dates roughly between 500 BC and AD 500. These dates were not obtained from stratigraphy as many of the artifacts and burials were disturbed by looting. Chronology was therefore determined by comparison to other nearby sites with similar grave goods and mortuary rituals.\n\nA general analysis was done of the 134 individuals identified through the minimum number of individuals method. Twenty-one burials in total were exhumed that contained human remains. The researchers noted pathological lesions in photos and written descriptions. A few specimens were x-rayed but the images yielded limited results. The majority of the injuries listed were cranial lesions. These were categorized into two groups: those caused by sharp force trauma (henceforth referred to SFT) which left small focused circles or lines and those caused by blunt force trauma (BFT,) resulting in round depressions in the scalp. SFT lesions are generally caused by sharp edged weapons, such as knives, swords and axes. Projectiles, such as arrows or those used by a slingshot should also be considered as SFT objects or items. BFT lesions result from clubs, cudgels and hammers. Perimortem injuries were identified as separate from healed injuries because they often had bone flakes adhered to the edges of the fractures. Researchers were careful to distinguish between lesions caused by violence and those caused by infectious disease.\n\nOut of the sample discovered at Phum Snay, 23.4% of the individuals showed signs of traumatic lesions, a number that is much higher than any other site in Southeast Asia. Both BFT and SFT were present within the skeletal remains, but there was a much higher rate of healed lesions than perimortem lesions. Some individuals had more than one lesion present upon the cranium. Within a sample of fifteen individuals, seventeen BFT lesions could be seen. These BFT lesions were rounded in shape, ranging in diameter from roughly 4 to 22 mm. Estimations suggest that injuries acquired by the individuals at the site were much higher than the remains can represent because a majority of assaults probably caused soft-tissue injuries, which would not be preserved in the archaeological record.\n\nWithin the Phum Snay site, two types of burials were found. These include bodies that were stretched out lying flat and pits where remains were simply in piles. The burials contained a variety of grave goods, including ceramic vessels, bronze ornaments (bangles, rings, and bells), and a large quantity of animal bones. The proportion of left forelimbs of hooved animals suggest a very particular sacrificial practice of animals within the burials. Researchers found that the manner of the burials and the goods contained within were closest in relation to the Óc Eo culture of the Mekong Delta.\n\nAnother major find within Phum Snay was the high percentage of burials containing weapons. The graves contained swords, daggers, spearheads, and projectile points. Due to the context of burials with high rates of traumatic lesions, the presence of these weapons indicates possible military formation, and certainly an increased level of violence than is seen in other sites within Southeast Asia. The weapons and tools found within the site were made of iron with bronze adornments. This solidified the site's place within the Iron Age because iron weapons and tools had many advantages over bronze, such as the high abundance of iron within the Earth, which made the spread of iron very rapid. Also present in the burials of a number of young adult males were ornamental shoulder decorations, which further support the idea of a violence-oriented society. The lack of blunt objects within the burials is slightly puzzling due to the higher rate of BFT lesions than SFT lesions, but this could be explained if the individuals at Phum Snay wore helmets for protection.\n\nThe health of the people living at Phum Snay was also determined from the burials. Rates of attrition, caries, and abscesses in the teeth of the human remains gave an idea of their dietary habits. The main result from the dentition was the presence of a social structure regarding male and female roles within the community. Rates of dental caries in females were higher than the males, which may be attributed to a sexual division of labor. If the men are out hunting, they are receiving a higher level of protein in the food they are consuming, while the females may be eating more cariogenic foods if they are back tending the fields and surrounded by starches and carbohydrates.\n\nMeasurements were taken on the cranial and dental morphologies of the individuals found within Phum Snay to compare them with those of modern Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos. The morphological similarities were found from Q-mode correlation coefficients of cranial and dental metrics. The findings indicated that the morphology of individuals at Phum Snay were significantly different than any of the other groups being compared. Overall, the modern groups have less robusticity than is found in the Phum Snay morphologies.\n\nThe high rates of traumatic lesions and weapons within the burials at Phum Snay suggest a society that values warriors. Fighting was an important part of life to the people, which could be indicative of increasing competition over access to exotic exchange items during the Iron Age. Furthering this idea is the general location of Phum Snay, right outside the Angkorian capital. Increasing competition over resources could have been the driving force behind the formation of a hierarchical society and organized state.\nThe differences in morphological features between the human remains at Phum Snay and other modern Southeast Asian areas lends itself to the two-layer hypothesis. The people at Phum Snay were less affected by the substantial gene flow received by other areas of Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "92556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92556", "title": "Popol Vuh", "text": "Popol Vuh\n\nPopol Vuh (also Popol Wuj or Popul Vuh) is a cultural narrative that recounts the mythology and history of the K'iche' people who inhabit the Guatemalan Highlands northwest of present-day Guatemala City.\n\nThe Popol Vuh is a creation narrative written by the K'iche' people before the Spanish conquest of Guatemala, originally preserved through oral tradition until approximately 1550 when it was written down. The survival of the Popol Vuh is credited to the 18th century Dominican friar Francisco Ximénez who made a copy of the original text in Spanish \nThe name \"Popol Vuh\" translates as \"Book of the Community\", \"Book of Counsel\", or more literally as \"Book of the People\". The Popol Vuh includes the Mayan creation myth, beginning with the exploits of the Hero Twins Hunahpú and Xbalanqué. As with similar texts (\"Chilam Balam\", being one example), a great deal of the Popol Vuh's significance lies in the scarcity of early accounts dealing with Mesoamerican mythologies due to the purging of documents by the Spanish Conquistadors.\n\nIn 1701, Father Ximénez came to Santo Tomás Chichicastenango (also known as Santo Tomás Chuilá). This town was in the Quiché territory and therefore is probably where Fr. Ximénez first redacted the mythistory. Ximénez transcribed and translated the manuscript in parallel K'iche' and Spanish columns (the K'iche' having been represented phonetically with Latin and Parra characters). In or around 1714, Ximénez incorporated the Spanish content in book one, chapters 2–21 of his \"Historia de la provincia de San Vicente de Chiapa y Guatemala de la orden de predicadores\". Ximénez's manuscripts remained posthumously in the possession of the Dominican Order until General Francisco Morazán expelled the clerics from Guatemala in 1829–30 whereupon the Order's documents passed largely to the Universidad de San Carlos.\n\nFrom 1852 to 1855, Moritz Wagner and Carl Scherzer traveled to Central America, arriving in Guatemala City in early May 1854. Scherzer found Ximénez's writings in the university library, noting that there was one particular item \"del mayor interes\" ('of the greatest interest'). With assistance from the Guatemalan historian and archivist Juan Gavarrete, Scherzer copied (or had a copy made) of the Spanish content from the last half of the manuscript, which he published upon his return to Europe. In 1855, French Abbot Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg also found Ximénez's writings in the university library. However, whereas Scherzer copied the manuscript, Brasseur apparently stole the university's volume and took it back to France. After Brasseur's death in 1874, the Mexico-Guatémalienne collection containing Popol Vuh passed to Alphonse Pinart through whom it was sold to Edward E. Ayer. In 1897, Ayer decided to donate his 17,000 pieces to The Newberry Library, a project that tarried until 1911. Father Ximénez's transcription-translation of \"Popol Vuh\" was among Ayer's donated items.\n\nFather Ximénez's manuscript sank into obscurity until Adrián Recinos (re)discovered it at The Newberry in 1941. Generally speaking, Recinos receives credit for finding the manuscript and publishing the first direct edition since Scherzer. But Munro Edmonson and Carlos López attribute the first (re)discovery to Walter Lehmann in 1928. Allen Christenson, Néstor Quiroa, Rosa Helena Chinchilla Mazariegos, John Woodruff, and Carlos López all consider the Newberry's volume to be Ximénez's one and only \"original.\"\n\nIt is generally believed that Ximénez borrowed a phonetic manuscript from a parishioner for his source, although Néstor Quiroa points out that \"such a manuscript has never been found, and thus Ximenez's work represents the only source for scholarly studies.\" This document would have been a phonetic rendering of an oral recitation performed in or around Santa Cruz del Quiché shortly following Pedro de Alvarado's 1524 conquest. By comparing the genealogy at the end of Popol Vuh with dated colonial records, Adrián Recinos and Dennis Tedlock suggest a date between 1554 and 1558. But to the extent that the text speaks of a \"written\" document, Woodruff cautions that \"critics appear to have taken the text of the first folio recto too much at face value in drawing conclusions about Popol Vuh's survival.\" If there was an early post-conquest document, one theory (first proposed by Rudolf Schuller) ascribes the phonetic authorship to Diego Reynoso, one of the signatories of the \"Título de Totonicapán\". Another possible author could have been Don Cristóbal Velasco, who, also in \"Titulo de Totonicapán\", is listed as \"Nim Chokoh Cavec\" ('Great Steward of the Kaweq'). In either case, the colonial presence is clear in Popol Vuh's preamble: \"This we shall write now under the Law of God and Christianity; we shall bring it to light because now the Popol Vuh, as it is called, cannot be seen any more, in which was clearly seen the coming from the other side of the sea and the narration of our obscurity, and our life was clearly seen.\" Accordingly, the need to \"preserve\" the content presupposes an imminent disappearance of the content, and therefore, Edmonson theorized a pre-conquest glyphic codex. No evidence of such a codex has yet been found.\n\nA minority, however, disputes the existence of pre-Ximénez texts on the same basis that is used to argue their existence. Both positions are based on two statements by Ximénez. The first of these comes from \"Historia de la provincia\" where Ximénez writes that he found various texts during his curacy of Santo Tomás Chichicastenango that were guarded with such secrecy \"that not even a trace of it was revealed among the elder ministers\" although \"almost all of them have it memorized.\" The second passage used to argue pre-Ximénez texts comes from Ximénez's addendum to \"Popol Vuh.\" There he states that many of the natives' practices can be \"seen in a book that they have, something like a prophecy, from the beginning of their [pre-Christian] days, where they have all the months and signs corresponding to each day, one of which I have in my possession.\" Scherzer explains in a footnote that what Ximénez is referencing \"is only a secret calendar\" and that he himself had \"found this rustic calendar previously in various indigenous towns in the Guatemalan highlands\" during his travels with Wagner. This presents a contradiction because the item which Ximénez has in his possession is not Popol Vuh, and a carefully guarded item is not likely to have been easily available to Ximénez. Apart from this, Woodruff surmises that because \"Ximenez never discloses his source, instead inviting readers to infer what they wish [...], it is plausible that there was no such alphabetic redaction among the Indians. The implied alternative is that he or another missionary made the first written text from an oral recitation.\"\n\nMany versions of the legend of the Hero Twins Hunahpú and Xbalanqué circulated through the Mayan peoples, but the story that survives was preserved by the Dominican priest Francisco Ximénez who translated the document between 1700 and 1715. Maya deities in the Post-Classic codices differ from the earlier versions described in the Early Classic period. In Mayan mythology Hunahpú and Xbalanqué are the second pair of twins out of three, preceded by Hun-Hunahpú and his brother Vucub-Hunahpú, and precursors to the third pair of twins, Hun Batz and Hun Chuen. In the Popol Vuh, the first set of twins, Hun-Hunahpú and Vucub-Hanahpú were invited to the Mayan Underworld, Xibalba, to play a ballgame with the Xibalban lords. In the Underworld the twins faced many trials filled with trickery; eventually they fail and are put to death. The Hero Twins, Hunahpú and Xblanaqué, are magically conceived after the death of their father, Hun-Hunahpú, and in time they return to Xibalba to avenge the deaths of their father and uncle by defeating the Lords of the Underworld.\n\nPopol Vuh encompasses a range of subjects that includes creation, ancestry, history, and cosmology. There are no content divisions in the Newberry Library's holograph, but popular editions have adopted the organization imposed by Brasseur de Bourbourg in 1861 in order to facilitate comparative studies. Though some variation has been tested by Tedlock and Christenson, editions typically take the following form:\n\nPreamble\n\nBook One\n\nBook Two\n\nBook Three\n\nBook 4\n\nA visual comparison of two sections of the Popol Vuh are presented below and include the original K'iche, literal English translation, and modern English translation as shown by Allen Christenson.\n\nSince Brasseur's and Scherzer's first editions, the Popol Vuh has been translated into many other languages besides its original K'iche'. The Spanish edition by Adrián Recinos is still a major reference, as is Recino's English translation by Delia Goetz. Other English translations include those of Victor Montejo, Munro Edmonson (1985), and Dennis Tedlock (1985, 1996). Tedlock's version is notable because it builds on commentary and interpretation by a modern K'iche' daykeeper, Andrés Xiloj. Augustín Estrada Monroy published a facsimile edition in the 1970s and Ohio State University has a digital version and transcription online. Modern translations and transcriptions of the K'iche' text have been published by, among others, Sam Colop (1999) and Allen J. Christenson (2004). The tale of Hunahpu and Xbalanque has also been rendered as an hour-long animated film by Patricia Amlin\n\nThe Popol Vuh continues to be an important part in the belief system of many K'iche'. Although Catholicism is generally seen as the dominant religion, some believe that many natives practice a syncretic blend of Christian and indigenous beliefs. Some stories from the \"Popol Vuh\" continued to be told by modern Maya as folk legends; some stories recorded by anthropologists in the 20th century may preserve portions of the ancient tales in greater detail than the Ximénez manuscript. On August 22, 2012, the Popol Vuh was declared \"intangible cultural heritage\" of Guatemala by the Guatemalan Ministry of Culture.\n\nSince its rediscovery by Europeans in the 19th century, the Popol Vuh has attracted the attention of many authors. For example, the myths and legends included in Louis L'Amour's novel \"The Haunted Mesa\" are largely based on the Popol Vuh. The planet of Camazotz in Madeleine L'Engle's \"A Wrinkle in Time\" is named for the bat-god of the hero-twins story. The text was also used by German film director Werner Herzog as extensive narration for the first chapter of his movie \"Fata Morgana\" (released 1971). Mexican painter Diego Rivera did a series of watercolors in 1931 as illustrations for the book.\n\nIn 1934, the Franco-American early avant-garde composer Edgard Varèse wrote his \"Ecuatorial\", a setting of words from the Popol Vuh for bass soloist and various instruments. The Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera began writing his opus 44 symphonic work \"Popol Vuh\" in 1975 but left the work incomplete at his death in 1983.\n\nIn Munich, Germany in 1969, keyboardist Florian Fricke—at the time ensconced in Mayan myth—formed a band named Popol Vuh with synth player Frank Fiedler and percussionist Holger Trulzsch. Their 1970 debut album, \"Affenstunde\", reflected this spiritual connection. The band is notable especially for its extremely early experimentation with forms that became popularized through the modern electronic, new age/ambient music that was to follow years later. They also collaborated with Werner Herzog on five of his movies. Another band by the same name, this one of Norwegian descent, formed around the same time, its name also inspired by the K'iche' writings.\n\nContemporary archaeologists (first of all Michael D. Coe) have found depictions of characters and episodes from Popol Vuh on Mayan ceramics and other art objects (e.g., the Hero Twins, Howler Monkey Gods, the shooting of Vucub-Caquix and, as many believe, the restoration of the Twins' dead father, Hun Hunahpu). The accompanying sections of hieroglyphical text could thus, theoretically, relate to passages from the \"Popol Vuh\". Richard D. Hansen found a stucco frieze depicting two floating figures that appear to be the Hero Twins at the site of El Mirador.\n\nFollowing the Twin Hero narrative, mankind is fashioned from white and yellow corn, demonstrating the crop's transcendent importance in Maya culture. To the Maya of the Classic period, Hun Hunahpu may have represented the maize god; his severed head became a calabash, or, as some believe, a cacao pod or an ear of corn. In this line, decapitation and sacrifice correspond to harvesting corn and the sacrifices accompanying planting and harvesting. Planting and harvesting also relate to Maya astronomy and calendar, since the cycles of the moon and sun determined the crop seasons.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39246077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39246077", "title": "Post–Cold War era", "text": "Post–Cold War era\n\nThe post–Cold War era is the period in world history from the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 9:00 am, December 26, 1991 to the present. The term was criticized for its ambiguity: \"Even though it has been ten years since the Berlin Wall came down,\" wrote Paul Wolfowitz in 2000, \"we still have no better name for the period in which we live than the \"post-Cold War era\".\" The name means that this new era “does not yet have a name.” It was suggested that \"Pax Americana\" or \"clash of civilisations\" would more reflect the reality of the era but the former term would be \"offending for many.\" The same dilemma expressed Condoleezza Rice: “That we do not know how to think about what follows the US-Soviet confrontation is clear from the continued references to the \"post-Cold War period.'\" \"We knew better where we had been than where we were going.”\n\nIt has mostly been dominated by the rise of globalization (as well as nationalism and populism in reaction) enabled by the commercialization of the Internet and the growth of the mobile phone system. The ideology of postmodernism and cultural relativism has according to some scholars replaced modernism and notions of absolute progress and ideology.\n\nThe period has seen the United States become by far the most powerful country in the world and the rise of China from a relatively weak developing country to a fledgling potential superpower. Reacting on the rise of China, the United States has strategically sought to \"rebalance\" the Asia-Pacific region. It has also seen the merging of most of Europe into one economy and a shift of power from the G7 to the larger G20. Accompanying the NATO expansion, Ballistic Missile Defenses (BMD) were installed in East Europe. These marked important steps in the military globalization.\n\nEnvironmentalism has also become a mainstream concern in the post-Cold War era following the circulation of widely accepted evidence for human activity's effects on Earth's climate. The same heightened consciousness is true of terrorism, owing largely to the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States and their global fallout.\n\nDuring most of the latter half of the 20th century, the two most powerful states in the world were the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US). These two federations were called the world's superpowers.\n\nFaced with the threat of growing Japanese, German and Italian fascism and a world war, the western Allies and the Soviet Union made an alliance of necessity during World War II.\n\nThe alliance between the US and USSR was simply against a greater common enemy and the two countries never really trusted each other. After the Axis was defeated, these two powers became highly suspicious of each other because of their vastly different ideologies.\n\nThis struggle, known as the Cold War, lasted from about 1947 to 1991, beginning with the second Red Scare and ending with the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. Prominent Historian of the Cold War, John Lewis Gaddis, wrote at the dawn of the post-Cold War era that the characteristics of the new era are not yet certain but it is certain that it will be very different from the Cold War era and it means that a turning point of world historical significance took place:\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union caused profound changes in nearly every society in the world. Much of the policy and infrastructure of the West and the Eastern Bloc had revolved around the capitalist and communist ideologies respectively and the possibility of a nuclear warfare.\n\nThe fall of Communism formed an existential threat for many institutions. The US military was forced to cut much of its expenditure, though the level rose again to comparable heights after the September 11 attacks and the initiation of the War on Terror in 2001.\n\nThe end of the Cold War also coincided with the end of apartheid in South Africa. Declining Cold War tensions in the later years of the 1980s meant that the apartheid regime was no longer supported by the West as a bulwark against Communism and they were condemned with an embargo. In 1990, Nelson Mandela was freed from prison and the regime made steps to end apartheid, which were on an official basis completed by 1994 with the new election.\n\nSocialist parties around the world saw drops in membership after the Berlin Wall fell and the public felt that free market ideology had won. Libertarian, neoliberal, nationalist and Islamist parties on the other hand benefited from the fall of the Soviet Union. As capitalism had \"won\", as people saw it, socialism in general declined in popularity. Social-Democratic Scandinavian countries privatized many of their commons in the 1990s and a political debate on modern institutions re-opened. Scandinavian nations are now more seen as social democrat (see Nordic model).\n\nThe United States, having become the only global superpower, was also able to use this ideological victory to reinforce its leadership position in the new world order. It was claimed that, “the United States and its allies are on the right side of history”. The US also became the most dominant influence over the newly connecting global economy. However, this unipolar international system was in tension with the emerging potential for a multipolar world as India, China, and Japan developed to a point where they might challenge US hegemony. This created new potential for worldwide conflict, ending the balance, from mutually assured destruction in the case of nuclear war, which had held the world in a state of “long peace” throughout the Cold War. \n\nThe People's Republic of China, already having moved towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s and facing public anger after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in Beijing, moved even more quickly towards free market economics in the 1990s. McDonald's and Pizza Hut both entered the country in the second half of 1990, the first American chains in China aside from Kentucky Fried Chicken which had entered 3 years earlier in 1987. Stock markets were established in Shenzhen and Shanghai late in 1990 as well. The restrictions on car ownership were loosened in the early 1990s, causing the bicycle to decline as a form of transport by 2000.\n\nThe move to capitalism has increased the economic prosperity of China, but many people still live in poor conditions, working for companies for very small pay and in dangerous and poor conditions.\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Communism would also end in Mongolia, Congo, Albania, Yugoslavia,\nAfghanistan, and Angola, today there are only five remaining Communist countries in the world.\n\nMany other third world countries who had seen involvement from the United States and/or the Soviet Union were also able to resolve political conflicts with the removal of the ideological interests of these superpowers. As a result of the apparent victory of democracy and capitalism in the Cold War, many more countries adapted these systems, which also allowed them access to the benefits of global trade, as economic power became more prominent than military power in the international arena. However, as the United States maintained global power, its role in many Regime Changes during the Cold War went mostly officially unacknowledged, even when some, such as El Salvador and Argentina, resulted in extensive human rights violations. \n\nThe end of the Cold War allowed many technologies that were formerly off limits to the public to be declassified. The most important of these was the Internet, which was created as ARPANET by the Pentagon as a system to keep in touch following an impending nuclear war. The last restrictions on commercial enterprise online were lifted in 1995.\n\nIn the approximately two decades since, the Internet's population and usefulness grew immensely. Only about 20 million people (less than 0.5 percent of the world's population at the time) were online in 1995, mostly in the US and several other Western countries. By the mid-2010s, more than one third of the world's population was online.\n\n\"*Postmodernism\"\n\n"}

Though the concept has a variety of historical precedent, the doctrine was explained by Harlan K. Ullman and James P. Wade in 1996 and was developed specifically for application by the US military by the National Defense University of the United States.\n\nRapid dominance is defined by its authors, Harlan K. Ullman and James P. Wade, as attempting\n\nFurther, rapid dominance will, according to Ullman and Wade,\n\nIntroducing the doctrine in a report to the United States' National Defense University in 1996, Ullman and Wade describe it as an attempt to develop a post-Cold War military doctrine for the United States. Rapid dominance and shock and awe, they write, may become a \"revolutionary change\" as the United States military is reduced in size and information technology is increasingly integrated into warfare. Subsequent U.S. military authors have written that rapid dominance exploits the \"superior technology, precision engagement, and information dominance\" of the United States.\n\nUllman and Wade identify four vital characteristics of rapid dominance:\n\nThe term \"shock and awe\" is most consistently used by Ullman and Wade as the effect that rapid dominance seeks to impose upon an adversary. It is the desired state of helplessness and lack of will. It can be induced, they write, by direct force applied to command and control centers, selective denial of information and dissemination of disinformation, overwhelming combat force, and rapidity of action.\n\nThe doctrine of rapid dominance has evolved from the concept of \"decisive force\". Ulman and Wade contrast the two concepts in terms of objective, use of force, force size, scope, speed, casualties, and technique.\n\nAlthough Ullman and Wade claim that the need to \"[m]inimize civilian casualties, loss of life, and collateral damage\" is a \"political sensitivity [which needs] to be understood up front\", their doctrine of rapid dominance requires the capability to disrupt \"means of communication, transportation, food production, water supply, and other aspects of infrastructure\", and, in practice, \"the appropriate balance of Shock and Awe must cause ... the threat and fear of action that may shut down all or part of the adversary's society or render his ability to fight useless short of complete physical destruction.\"\n\nUsing as an example a theoretical invasion of Iraq 20 years after Operation Desert Storm, the authors claimed, \"Shutting the country down would entail both the physical destruction of appropriate infrastructure and the shutdown and control of the flow of all vital information and associated commerce so rapidly as to achieve a level of national shock akin to the effect that dropping nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had on the Japanese.\"\n\nReiterating the example in an interview with CBS News several months before Operation Iraqi Freedom, Ullman stated, \"You're sitting in Baghdad and all of a sudden you're the general and 30 of your division headquarters have been wiped out. You also take the city down. By that I mean you get rid of their power, water. In 2, 3, 4, 5 days they are physically, emotionally and psychologically exhausted.\"\n\nUllman and Wade argue that there have been military applications that fall within some of the concepts of shock and awe. They enumerate nine examples:\n\nRussia's military strategy in the First Chechen War, and particularly the Battle of Grozny, was described as \"shock and awe.\"\n\nBefore the 2003 invasion of Iraq, United States armed forces officials described their plan as employing shock and awe.\n\nBefore its implementation, there was dissent within the Bush Administration as to whether the shock and awe plan would work. According to a CBS News report, \"One senior official called it a bunch of bull, but confirmed it is the concept on which the war plan is based.\" CBS Correspondent David Martin noted that during Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan in the prior year, the U.S. forces were \"badly surprised by the willingness of al Qaeda to fight to the death. If the Iraqis fight, the U.S. would have to throw in reinforcements and win the old fashioned way by crushing the Republican Guards, and that would mean more casualties on both sides.\"\n\nContinuous bombing began on March 19, 2003 as United States forces unsuccessfully attempted to kill Saddam Hussein. Attacks continued against a small number of targets until March 21, 2003, when, at 1700 UTC, the main bombing campaign of the US and their allies began. Its forces launched approximately 1,700 air sorties (504 using cruise missiles). Coalition ground forces had begun a \"running start\" offensive towards Baghdad on the previous day. Coalition ground forces seized Baghdad on April 5, and the United States declared victory on April 14. The term \"shock and awe\" is typically used to describe only the very beginning of the invasion of Iraq, not the larger war, nor the ensuing insurgency.\n\nTo what extent the United States fought a campaign of shock and awe is unclear as post-war assessments are contradictory. Within two weeks of the United States' victory declaration, on April 27, \"The Washington Post\" published an interview with Iraqi military personnel detailing demoralization and lack of command. According to the soldiers, Coalition bombing was surprisingly widespread and had a severely demoralizing effect. When United States tanks passed through the Iraqi military's Republican Guard and Special Republican Guard units outside Baghdad to Saddam's presidential palaces, it caused a shock to troops inside Baghdad. Iraqi soldiers said there was no organization intact by the time the United States entered Baghdad and that resistance crumbled under the presumption that \"it wasn't a war, it was suicide.\"\n\nIn contrast, in an October 2003 presentation to the United States House Committee on Armed Services, staff of the United States Army War College did not attribute their performance to rapid dominance. Rather, they cited technological superiority and \"Iraqi ineptitude\". The speed of the coalition's actions (\"rapidity\"), they said, did not affect Iraqi morale. Further, they said that Iraqi armed forces ceased resistance only after direct force-on-force combat within cities.\n\nAccording to \"National Geographic\" researcher Bijal Trivedi, \"Even after several days of bombing the Iraqis showed remarkable resilience. Many continued with their daily lives, working and shopping, as bombs continued to fall around them. According to some analysts, the military's attack was perhaps too precise. It did not trigger shock and awe in the Iraqis and, in the end, the city was only captured after close combat on the outskirts of Baghdad.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\" correspondent Brian Whitaker in 2003, \"To some in the Arab and Muslim countries, Shock and Awe is terrorism by another name; to others, a crime that compares unfavourably with September 11.\" Anti-war protesters in 2003 also claimed that \"the shock and awe pummeling of Baghdad [was] a kind of terrorism.\"\n\nA dossier released by Iraq Body Count, a project of the U.K. non-governmental non-violent and disarmament organization Oxford Research Group, attributed approximately 6,616 civilian deaths to the actions of U.S.-led forces during the \"invasion phase\", including the shock-and-awe bombing campaign on Baghdad.\n\nThese findings were disputed by both the U.S. military and the Iraqi government. Lieutenant Colonel Steve Boylan, the spokesman for the U.S. military in Baghdad, stated, \"I don't know how they are doing their methodology and can't talk to how they calculate their numbers,\" as well as \"we do everything we can to avoid civilian casualties in all of our operations.\" National Geographic researcher Bijal Trivedi stated, \"Civilian casualties did occur, but the strikes, for the most part, were surgical.\"\n\nFollowing the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the US, the term \"shock and awe\" has been used for commercial purposes. The United States Patent and Trademark Office received at least 29 trademark applications in 2003 for exclusive use of the term. The first came from a fireworks company on the day the US started bombing Baghdad. Sony registered the trademark the day after the beginning of the operation for use in a video game title but later withdrew the application and described it as \"an exercise of regrettable bad judgment.\" It is also the name of a level in the video game \"\", in which the player character experiences a nuclear detonation. The preceding section of the game is an example of Shock and Awe tactics, as the United States Marine Corps executes the strategy in an unnamed Middle Eastern country. The term is also used as an achievement in the popularly acclaimed game \"Starcraft 2\", where it is obtained when a certain number of units die to the tactical strike craft whilst invisible. It is also the name of an achievement in \"Gears of War 2\" and Miss Fortune's weapons in \"League of Legends\". Miscellaneous other uses of the term include golf equipment, an insecticide, a set of bowling balls, a racehorse, a shampoo, condoms, and heroin.\n\nIn an interview, Harlan Ullman stated that he believed that using the term to try to sell products was \"probably a mistake,\" and \"the marketing value will be somewhere between slim and none.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Introduced by Brad Steiger in his 1976 book \"Gods of Aquarius\", it argues that certain people originated as extraterrestrials and arrived on Earth through birth or as a walk-in to an existing human body. It is a variant of the belief in alien-human hybrids. There are many different beliefs as to the origins of star people or starseeds. The term \"star people\" was taken from an existing Native American spiritual concept.\n\nSteiger described \"Star People\" in his 1976 book on contactees as \"humans who come from a special gene pool linked to visits by extraterrestrials\".\n\nThey claim to come into human lifeforms and suffer helplessness and total amnesia concerning their identity, origins and life-purpose. The awakening process claimed to be experienced is described as either a gradual series of realizations over time, or an abrupt and dramatic awakening of consciousness. Through the awakening process, they regain memories about their past, origins and missions. An increase in intuition, psychic ability, and the sense of a more universal \"self\" that transcends mortal identity are also commonly reported. Some claim communication via telepathy with unearthly beings, either physical or non-physical. Some believe that life exists on other planets. Most believe they have lived on other planets, and many recount experiences they claim are memories of life on other worlds. The concepts of spaceships, intergalactic travel, psychic phenomena and sentient life forms in other galaxies are common.\n\n\"Washington Post\" journalist Joel Achenbach interviewed people who said they were starseeds from the Pleiades for his book \"Captured by Aliens: The Search for Life and Truth in a Very Large Universe\", and noted the contrast with ufologists: \"the starseed are precisely the kind of New Age figures the traditional ufologists can’t stand. Ufologists look outward, toward the universe, for answers to the alien enigma. New Agers look inward.\"\n\nAdvocates of the concept of star people / starseeds include Sheldan Nidle, who founded the Planetary Activation Organization. There is an online following.\n\nSteiger recounted that Philip K. Dick had written to him in the late 1970s to say he thought he might be one of the star people, and that his novel \"VALIS\" contained related themes.\n\n"}

Using this term, Mizubayashi and others reenvision the Tokugawa state not as a single, unified, bureaucratic entity, but as a feudal conglomeration of loosely tied together by their fealty to the shogunate, and by other obligations and systems imposed by the shogunate. In other words, he refocuses attention away from the shogunate, to the individual domains; building upon Mizubayashi's work, a considerable number of scholars have since published articles and books analyzing the history of individual \"han\" and reconsidering the extent to which they might be regarded as separate small countries, more loosely connected to the shogunate than was previously thought.\n\nMizubayashi also argued that the decentralized nature of the Tokugawa state was due not primarily to a weak shogunate, but to the strength of the domains (\"han\"). In particular, he pointed to the strength of the \"ie\" system, under which daimyo (feudal lords) were dedicated to protecting the honor, integrity, and wealth or power of their clan. Not strictly a matter of family or household honor and integrity, \"ie\" or clans were often continued by an adopted heir without diminishing its legitimacy. In Mizubayashi's vision, the political system of Tokugawa Japan was founded upon the \"ie\". Tokugawa Japan consisted of a number of daimyo clans enfeoffed by the Tokugawa clan, and in turn regarding other smaller samurai clans, merchant households, and peasant households as their vassals or subjects; Ravina also points out that religious institutions were frequently operated like \"ie\" in the Tokugawa period, with continuation of the order under an heir (adopted or otherwise) of the current head.\n\n"}

Value criticism follows in the traditions of the Frankfurt School and critical theory developed under Max Horkheimer. Prominent adherents of value criticism include Robert Kurz, Roswitha Scholz, Moishe Postone and Jean-Marie Vincent.\nValue criticism takes crucial aspects of Marx's critiques of commodity fetishism, commodities and value, while criticizing Marx's theory of class struggle and historical materialism. As a result, proponents of Value Criticism feel that the working class is not necessarily a revolutionary subject. Instead, it is pointed out that labor has to be understood as a historic specific entity and that criticizing capitalism implies not only criticizing the distribution process in capitalism, but also the capitalistic production process and the productive powers. From this, they conclude that all actually existing socialisms thus far have been in essence forms of state-led capitalism, where production still followed capitalistic principles. This interpretation, which rejects the traditional Marxist point of view, is defended in the \"Manifesto Against Labour\".\n\nIn addition to value criticism, a new branch appeared within a circle of theorists led by Roswitha Scholz. The so-called critique of value direction (in German called \"Wertabspaltungskritik\") includes not only precise descriptions of the \"abstract and fetishized character of modern domination\", but also seeks to explain why irrational attitudes are delegated to women, while men are counted as relatively rational actors in the capitalistic society.\n\nMany leftists claim that books such as \"The Black Book of Capitalism\" neither offers a realistic alternative to capitalistic society nor provide any options for actions to overcome capitalism. Additionally, Gerhard Hanloser and Karl Reitter claim that value criticism is a critique from the standpoint of the circulation sphere which can not be explained from within itself.\n\nPublishers of value criticism in Germany are the \"Krisis\" group and Exit!, to both of which Robert Kurz made crucial contributions. Much value critical literature has still to be translated into English. Elmar Flatschart from the University of Vienna is also publishing in English for the Exit! group. Moishe Postone and his work \"Time, Labor and Social Domination\" is often cited by value critics.\n"}
{"id": "8980330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8980330", "title": "WALL-E", "text": "WALL-E\n\nWALL-E (stylized with an interpunct as WALL·E) is a 2008 American computer-animated science fiction film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It was directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton, produced by Jim Morris, and co-written by Jim Reardon. It stars the voices of Ben Burtt, Elissa Knight, Jeff Garlin, Fred Willard, John Ratzenberger, Kathy Najimy and Sigourney Weaver, and was the overall ninth feature film produced by the company. It follows a solitary trash compactor robot on a future deserted Earth, left to clean up garbage. However, he is visited by a probe sent by the starship \"Axiom\", whom he falls in love with and pursues across the galaxy.\n\nAfter directing \"Finding Nemo\", Stanton felt Pixar had created believable simulations of underwater physics and was willing to direct a film set largely in space. \"WALL-E\" has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, corporatism, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact and concerns, obesity, and global catastrophic risk. It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, \"WALL-E\" was paired with a short film titled \"Presto\" for its theatrical release.\n\n\"WALL-E\" was released in the United States on June 27, 2008. The film was an instant blockbuster, grossing $533.3 million worldwide over a $180 million budget, and winning the 2008 Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film, the 2009 Hugo Award for Best Long Form Dramatic Presentation, the final Nebula Award for Best Script, the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature with five nominations. It is considered by many fans and critics as the best film of 2008. The film also topped \"Time\"s list of the \"Best Movies of the Decade\", and in 2016 was voted 29th among 100 films considered the best of the 21st century by 117 film critics from around the world.\n\nIn the 29th century, Earth has been abandoned and covered in garbage, its population having been evacuated by the megacorporation Buy-N-Large (BnL) on giant starliners seven centures earlier after decades of mass consumerism facilitated by BnL. BnL has left behind WALL-E robot trash compactors to clean up; however, all have since stopped functioning, except one unit who has gained sentience and is scavenging parts from other units to remain active. One day, WALL-E discovers a healthy seedling, which he returns to his trailer home. Later, an unmanned spaceship lands and deploys an EVE probe to scan the planet for plant life. WALL-E is infatuated with EVE, who is initially hostile but gradually befriends him. When WALL-E brings EVE to his trailer and shows her the plant, however, she suddenly takes the plant inside her and goes into standby mode. WALL-E, confused, unsuccessfully tries to reactivate her. The ship then returns to collect EVE, and with WALL-E clinging on, returns to its mothership, the starliner \"Axiom\".\n\nThe \"Axiom\"s passengers have become obese and feeble due to microgravity and reliance on an automated lifestyle, including the ship's current captain, McCrea, who leaves the ship under the control of the robotic autopilot, AUTO. EVE is taken to the bridge, with WALL-E tagging along. McCrea is unprepared for a positive probe response, but learns that placing EVE's plant in the ship's Holo-Detector for verification will trigger a hyperjump back to Earth so humanity can recolonize it. The plant proves to be missing from EVE's storage compartment, though, and she blames WALL-E for its disappearance.\n\nWith the plant missing, EVE is deemed faulty and taken to Diagnostics. WALL-E misinterprets the procedure as torture, and in intervening accidentally frees a group of malfunctioning robots and causes both EVE and himself to be designated as rogue robots. Frustrated, EVE takes WALL-E to an escape pod to send him home to retrieve the plant, but they are interrupted when first mate robot GO-4 arrives with the plant, having stolen it from EVE on AUTO's orders. GO-4 places the plant in an escape pod and sets it to self-destruct, but WALL-E enters just before it is jettisoned. WALL-E escapes, saving the plant, and he and EVE reconcile and celebrate with a dance in space around the \"Axiom\".\n\nEVE brings the plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's recordings of Earth and concludes that they have to return to clean up. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive A113, issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded in 2110 that the planet could not be saved. AUTO mutinies, electrocuting WALL-E and shutting EVE down, and throwing them both down the garbage chute before confining the captain to his quarters. EVE automatically reboots herself and helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E as he struggles to keep it open. Seeing WALL-E's sacrifice, McCrea successfully deactivates AUTO while EVE inserts the plant to activate the hyperjump.\n\nArriving back on Earth, EVE repairs WALL-E, but finds that his memory has been reset and his personality is gone. Heartbroken, EVE gives WALL-E a farewell kiss, which sparks his memory and restores his original personality. WALL-E and EVE reunite as the humans and robots of the \"Axiom\" begin to restore Earth and its environment. During the credits, scenes of the humans and robots learning to farm, fish, and build are shown in various art styles, with the implication being that Earth is turned into a paradise over several generations.\n\n\nAndrew Stanton conceived \"WALL-E\" during a lunch with fellow writers John Lasseter, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft in 1994. \"Toy Story\" was near completion and the writers brainstormed ideas for their next projects—\"A Bug's Life\", \"Monsters, Inc.\", and \"Finding Nemo\"—at this lunch. Stanton asked, \"What if mankind had to leave Earth and somebody forgot to turn off the last robot?\" Having struggled for many years with making the characters in \"Toy Story\" appealing, Stanton found his simple \"Robinson Crusoe\"-esque idea of a lonely robot on a deserted planet strong. Stanton made WALL-E a waste collector as the idea was instantly understandable, and because it was a low-status menial job that made him sympathetic. Stanton also liked the imagery of stacked cubes of garbage. He did not find the idea dark because having a planet covered in garbage was for him a childish imagining of disaster.\n\nStanton and Pete Docter developed the film under the title of \"Trash Planet\" for two months in 1995, but they did not know how to develop the story and Docter chose to direct \"Monsters, Inc.\" instead. Stanton came up with the idea of WALL-E finding a plant, because his life as the sole inhabitant on a deserted world reminded Stanton of a plant growing among pavements. Before they turned their attention to other projects, Stanton and Lasseter thought about having WALL-E fall in love, as it was the necessary progression away from loneliness. Stanton started writing \"WALL-E\" again in 2002 while completing \"Finding Nemo\". Stanton formatted his script in a manner reminiscent of Dan O'Bannon's \"Alien\". O'Bannon wrote his script in a manner Stanton found reminded him of \"haiku\", where visual descriptions were done in continuous lines of a few words. Stanton wrote his robot dialogue conventionally, but placed them in brackets. In late 2003, Stanton and a few others created a story reel of the first twenty minutes of the film. Lasseter and Steve Jobs were impressed and officially began development, though Jobs stated he did not like the title, originally spelled \"W.A.L.-E.\"\n\nWhile the first act of \"WALL-E\" \"fell out of the sky\" for Stanton, he had originally wanted aliens to plant EVE to explore Earth and the rest of the film was different. When WALL-E comes to the \"Axiom\", he incites a \"Spartacus\"-style rebellion by the robots against the remnants of the human race, which were cruel alien Gels (completely devolved, gelatinous, boneless, legless, see-through, green creatures that resemble Jell-O). James Hicks, a physiologist, mentioned to Stanton the concept of atrophy and the effects prolonged weightlessness would have on humans living in space for an inordinately extended time period. Therefore, this was the inspiration of the humans degenerating into the alien Gels, and their ancestry would have been revealed in a \"Planet of the Apes\"-style ending. The Gels also spoke a made-up gibberish language, but Stanton scrapped this idea because he thought it would be too complicated for the audience to understand and they could easily be driven off from the storyline. The Gels had a royal family, who host a dance in a castle on a lake in the back of the ship, and the \"Axiom\" curled up into a ball when returning to Earth in this incarnation of the story. Stanton decided this was too bizarre and unengaging, and conceived humanity as \"big babies\". Stanton developed the metaphorical theme of the humans learning to stand again and \"grow[ing] up\", wanting WALL-E and EVE's relationship to inspire humanity because he felt few films explore how utopian societies come to exist. The process of depicting the descendants of humanity as the way they appear in the movie was slow. Stanton first decided to put a nose and ears on the Gels so the audience could recognize them. Eventually, fingers, legs, clothes, and other characteristics were added until they arrived at the concept of being fetus-like to allow the audience to see themselves in the characters.\n\nIn a later version of the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to retrieve EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to \"Get Smart\", Auto takes the plant and goes into the bowels of the ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he really takes command of the \"Axiom\".\n\nOriginally, EVE would have been electrocuted by Auto, and then be quickly saved from ejection at the hands of the WALL-A robots by WALL-E. He would have then revived her by replacing her power unit with a cigarette lighter he brought from Earth. Stanton reversed this following a 2007 test screening, as he wanted to show EVE replacing her directive of bringing the plant to the captain with repairing WALL-E, and it made WALL-E even more heroic if he held the holo-detector open despite being badly hurt. Stanton also moved the moment where WALL-E reveals his plant (which he had snatched from the self-destructing escape pod) from producing it from a closet to immediately after his escape, as it made EVE happier and gave them stronger motivation to dance around the ship. Stanton felt half the audience at the screening believed the humans would be unable to cope with living on Earth and would have died out after the film's end. Jim Capobianco, director of the \"Ratatouille\" short film \"Your Friend the Rat\", created an end credits animation that continued the story—and stylized in different artistic movements throughout history—to clarify an optimistic tone.\n\n\"WALL-E\" was the most complex Pixar production since \"Monsters, Inc.\" because of the world and the history that had to be conveyed. Whereas most Pixar films have up to 75,000 storyboards, \"WALL-E\" required 125,000. Production designer Ralph Eggleston wanted the lighting of the first act on Earth to be romantic, and that of the second act on the \"Axiom\" to be cold and sterile. During the third act, the romantic lighting is slowly introduced into the \"Axiom\" environment. Pixar studied Chernobyl and the city of Sofia to create the ruined world; art director Anthony Christov was from Bulgaria and recalled Sofia used to have problems storing its garbage. Eggleston bleached out the whites on Earth to make WALL-E feel vulnerable. The overexposed light makes the location look more vast. Because of the haziness, the cubes making up the towers of garbage had to be large, otherwise they would have lost shape (in turn, this helped save rendering time). The dull tans of Earth subtly become soft pinks and blues when EVE arrives. When WALL-E shows EVE all his collected items, all the lights he has collected light up to give an inviting atmosphere, like a Christmas tree. Eggleston tried to avoid the colors yellow and green so WALL-E—who was made yellow to emulate a tractor—would not blend into the deserted Earth, and to make the plant more prominent.\n\nStanton also wanted the lighting to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He thought that Pixar captured the physics of being underwater with \"Finding Nemo\" and so for \"WALL-E\", he wanted to push that for air. While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films, he realized that Pixar's other movies had lacked the look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion, lens flare, and racking focus. Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks. Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting. 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments. The first lighting test included building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70 mm camera, and then trying to replicate that in the computer. Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.\n\nStanton wanted the \"Axiom\"s interior to resemble Shanghai and Dubai. Eggleston studied 1960s NASA paintings and the original concept art for Tomorrowland for the \"Axiom\", to reflect that era's sense of optimism. Stanton remarked \"We are all probably very similar in our backgrounds here [at Pixar] in that we all miss the Tomorrowland that was promised us from the heyday of Disneyland,\" and wanted a \"jet pack\" feel. Pixar also studied the Disney Cruise Line and visited Las Vegas, which was helpful in understanding artificial lighting. Eggleston based his \"Axiom\" designs on the futuristic architecture of Santiago Calatrava. Eggleston divided the inside of the ship into three sections; the rear's economy class has a basic gray concrete texture with graphics keeping to the red, blue, and white of the BnL logo. The coach class with living/shopping spaces has \"S\" shapes as people are always looking for \"what's around the corner\". Stanton intended to have many colorful signs, but he realized this would overwhelm the audience and went with Eggleston's original idea of a small number of larger signs. The premier class is a large Zen-like spa with colors limited to turquoise, cream, and tan, and leads on to the captain's warm carpeted and wooded quarters and the sleek dark bridge. In keeping with the artificial \"Axiom\", camera movements were modeled after those of the steadicam.\n\nThe use of live action was a stepping stone for Pixar, as Stanton was planning to make \"John Carter of Mars\" his next project. Storyboarder Derek Thompson noted introducing live action meant that they would make the rest of the film look even more realistic. Eggleston added that if the historical humans had been animated and slightly caricaturized, the audience then would not have been able to recognize how serious their devolution was. Stanton cast Fred Willard as the historical Buy n Large CEO because \"[h]e's the most friendly and insincere car salesman I could think of.\" The CEO says \"stay the course\", which Stanton used because he thought it was funny. Industrial Light & Magic did the visual effects for these shots.\n\n\"WALL-E\" went undeveloped during the 1990s partly because Stanton and Pixar were not confident enough yet to have a feature length film with a main character that behaved like Luxo Jr. or R2-D2. Stanton explained there are two types of robots in cinema: \"human[s] with metal skin\", like the Tin Man, or \"machine[s] with function\" like Luxo and R2. He found the latter idea \"powerful\" because it allowed the audience to project personalities onto the characters, as they do with babies and pets: \"You're compelled ... you almost can't stop yourself from finishing the sentence 'Oh, I think it likes me! I think it's hungry! I think it wants to go for a walk!'\" He added, \"We wanted the audience to believe they were witnessing a machine that has come to life.\" The animators visited recycling stations to study machinery, and also met robot designers, visited NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to study robots, watched a recording of a Mars rover, and borrowed a bomb detecting robot from the San Francisco Police Department. Simplicity was preferred in their performances as giving them too many movements would make them feel human.\n\nStanton wanted WALL-E to be a box and EVE to be like an egg. WALL-E's eyes were inspired by a pair of binoculars Stanton was given when watching the Oakland Athletics play against the Boston Red Sox. He \"missed the entire inning\" because he was distracted by them. The director was reminded of Buster Keaton and decided the robot would not need a nose or mouth. Stanton added a zoom lens to make WALL-E more sympathetic. Ralph Eggleston noted this feature gave the animators more to work with and gave the robot a childlike quality. Pixar's studies of trash compactors during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body. His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels. The animators wanted him to have elbows, but realized this was unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body. His arms also looked flimsy when they did a test of him waving. Animation director Angus MacLane suggested they attach his arms to a track on the sides of his body to move them around, based on the inkjet printers his father designed. This arm design contributed to creating the character's posture, so if they wanted him to be nervous, they would lower them.\n\nStanton wanted EVE to be at the higher end of technology, and asked iPod designer Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He was very impressed. Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from \"\", and the usage of \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" for the showdown between Captain McCrea and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall or ceiling gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.\n\nTo animate their robots, the film's story crew and animation crew watched a Keaton and a Charlie Chaplin film every day for almost a year, and occasionally a Harold Lloyd picture. Afterwards, the filmmakers knew all emotions could be conveyed silently. Stanton cited Keaton's \"great stone face\" as giving them perseverance in animating a character with an unchanging expression. As he rewatched these, Stanton felt that filmmakers—since the advent of sound—relied on dialogue too much to convey exposition. The filmmakers dubbed the cockroach WALL-E keeps as a pet \"Hal\", in reference to silent film producer Hal Roach (as well as being an additional reference to HAL 9000). They also watched \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", \"The Black Stallion\" and \"Never Cry Wolf\", films that had sound but were not reliant on dialogue. Stanton acknowledged \"Silent Running\" as an influence because its silent robots were a forerunner to the likes of R2-D2, and that the \"hopeless romantic\" Woody Allen also inspired WALL-E.\n\nProducer Jim Morris recommended Ben Burtt as sound designer for \"WALL-E\" because Stanton kept using R2-D2 as the benchmark for the robots. Burtt had completed \"\" and told his wife he would no longer work on films with robots, but found \"WALL-E\" and its substitution of voices with sound \"fresh and exciting\". He recorded 2500 sounds for the film, which was twice the average number for a \"Star Wars\" film, and a record in his career. Burtt began work in 2005, and experimented with filtering his voice for two years. Burtt described the robot voices as \"like a toddler [...] universal language of intonation. 'Oh', 'Hm?', 'Huh!', you know?\"\n\nDuring production Burtt had the opportunity to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on \"WALL-E\". Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked in sync with the animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not find one that worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot.\n\nBurtt saw a hand-cranked electrical generator while watching \"Island in the Sky\", and bought an identical, unpacked device from 1950 on eBay to use for WALL-E moving around. Burtt also used an automobile self starter for when WALL-E goes fast, and the sound of cars being wrecked at a demolition derby provided for WALL-E's compressing trash in his body. The Macintosh computer chime was used to signify when WALL-E has fully recharged his battery. For EVE, Burtt wanted her humming to have a musical quality. Burtt was only able to provide neutral or masculine voices, so Pixar employee Elissa Knight was asked to provide her voice for Burtt to electronically modify. Stanton deemed the sound effect good enough to properly cast her in the role. Burtt recorded a flying radio-controlled jet plane for EVE's flying, and for her plasma cannon, Burtt hit a slinky hung from a ladder with a timpani stick. He described it as a \"cousin\" to the blaster noise from \"Star Wars\".\n\nMacInTalk was used because Stanton \"wanted Auto to be the epitome of a robot, cold, zeros & ones, calculating, and soulless [and] Stephen Hawking's kind of voice I thought was perfect.\" Additional sounds for the character were meant to give him a clockwork feel, to show he is always thinking and calculating.\n\nBurtt had visited Niagara Falls in 1987 and used his recordings from his trip for the sounds of wind. He ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record the sandstorm though. For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling shopping carts, Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart. They crashed it around the parking lot and then let it tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling handcuffs.\n\nThomas Newman recollaborated with Stanton on \"WALL-E\" since the two got along well on \"Nemo\", which gave Newman the Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Feature. He began writing the score in 2005, in the hope that starting this task early would make him more involved with the finished film. But, Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script. EVE's theme was arranged for the first time in October 2007. Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements, and Newman was encouraged to make it sound more feminine. Newman said Stanton had thought up many ideas for how he wanted the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the \"Axiom\", and used electronics too.\nStanton originally wanted to juxtapose the opening shots of space with 1930s French swing music, but he saw \"The Triplets of Belleville\" (2003) and did not want to appear as if he were copying it. Stanton then thought about the song \"Put On Your Sunday Clothes\" from \"Hello, Dolly!\", since he had portrayed the sidekick Barnaby Tucker in a 1980 high school production. Stanton found that the song was about two naive young men looking for love, which was similar to WALL-E's own hope for companionship. Jim Reardon suggested WALL-E find the film on video, and Stanton included \"It Only Takes a Moment\" and the clip of the actors holding hands, because he wanted a visual way to show how WALL-E understands love and conveys it to EVE. \"Hello Dolly!\" composer Jerry Herman allowed the songs to be used without knowing what for; when he saw the film, he found its incorporation into the story \"genius\". Coincidentally, Newman's uncle Lionel worked on \"Hello, Dolly!\"\n\nNewman travelled to London to compose the end credits song \"Down to Earth\" with Peter Gabriel, who was one of Stanton's favorite musicians. Afterwards, Newman rescored some of the film to include the song's composition, so it would not sound intrusive when played. Louis Armstrong's rendition of \"La Vie en rose\" was used for a montage where WALL-E does not get EVE's attention on Earth. The script also specified using Bing Crosby's \"Stardust\" for when the two robots dance around the \"Axiom\", but Newman asked if he could score the scene himself. A similar switch occurred for the sequence in which WALL-E attempts to wake EVE up through various means; originally, the montage would play with the instrumental version of \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\", but Newman wanted to challenge himself and scored an original piece for the sequence.\n\nThe film is recognized as social criticism. Katherine Ellison asserts that \"Americans produce nearly 400 million tons of solid waste per year but recycle less than a third of it, according to a recent Columbia University study.\" Landfills are filling up so quickly that the UK may run out of landfill space by the year 2017.\n\nBecause \"WALL-E\" overtly critiques consumerism, it also critiques Disney's production values and aesthetic, without being too obvious. In the DVD commentary, Stanton said that he has been asked if it was his intention to make a movie about consumerism. His answer was it was not; it was a way to answer the question of how would the Earth get to the state where one robot would be left to continue the cleanup by itself. Nevertheless, some critics have noted an incongruity between the pro-environmental and anti-consumerist messaging of the film, and the environmental impacts in the production and merchandising of the film.\n\nIn \"WALL-E: from environmental adaption to sentimental nostalgia,\" Robin Murray and Joseph Heumann explain the important theme of nostalgia in this film. Nostalgia is clearly represented by human artifacts, left behind, that WALL-E collects and cherishes, for example Zippo lighters, hubcaps, and plastic sporks. These modern items that we use out of necessity, are made sentimental through the lens of the bleak future of Earth. Nostalgia is also expressed through the musical score, as the film opens with a camera shot of outer space that slowly zooms into a waste filled Earth while playing \"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\", reflecting on simpler and happier times in human history. This film also expresses nostalgia through the longing of nature and the natural world, as it is the sight and feeling of soil, and the plant brought back to the space ship by EVE, that make the captain decide it is time for humans to move back to Earth. WALL-E expresses nostalgia also, by reflecting on romantic themes of older Disney and silent films.\n\nStanton describes the theme of the film as \"irrational love defeats life's programming\":\nI realized the point I was trying to push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try and figure out what the point of living was ... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built ... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of the whole point of the movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.\n\nStanton noted many commentators placed emphasis on the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because \"that disconnection is going to be the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet\". Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships. Christian journalist Rod Dreher saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the \"Axiom\" has separated them from nature, making them \"slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human\". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. \"\"WALL-E\" is not a Luddite film,\" he said. \"It doesn't demonize technology. It only argues that technology is properly used to help humans cultivate their true nature—that it must be subordinate to human flourishing, and help move that along.\"\n\nStanton, who is a Christian, named EVE after the Biblical figure because WALL-E's loneliness reminded him of Adam, before God created his wife. Dreher noted EVE's biblical namesake and saw her directive as an inversion of that story; EVE uses the plant to tell humanity to return to Earth and move away from the \"false god\" of BnL and the lazy lifestyle it offers. Dreher also noted this departure from classical Christian viewpoints, where Adam is \"cursed\" to labor, in that \"WALL-E\" argues hard work is what makes humans human. Dreher emphasized the false god parallels to BnL in a scene where a robot teaches infants \"B is for Buy n Large, your very best friend\", which he compared to modern corporations such as McDonald's creating brand loyalty in children. Megan Basham of \"World\" magazine felt the film criticizes the pursuit of leisure, whereas WALL-E in his stewardship learns to truly appreciate God's creation.\n\nDuring writing, a Pixar employee noted to Jim Reardon that EVE was reminiscent of the dove with the olive branch from the story of Noah's Ark, and the story was reworked with EVE finding a plant to return humanity from its voyage. WALL-E himself has been compared to Prometheus, Sisyphus, and Butades: in an essay discussing WALL-E as representative of the artistic strive of Pixar itself, Hrag Vartanian compared WALL-E to Butades in a scene where the robot expresses his love for EVE by making a sculpture of her from spare parts. \"The Ancient Greek tradition associates the birth of art with a Corinthian maiden who longing to preserve her lover's shadow traces it on the wall before he departed for war. The myth reminds us that art was born out of longing and often means more for the creator than the muse. In the same way Stanton and his Pixar team have told us a deeply personal story about their love of cinema and their vision for animation through the prism of all types of relationships.\"\n\nContinuing a Pixar tradition, \"WALL-E\" was paired with a short film for its theatrical release, \"Presto\". The film was dedicated to Justin Wright (1981–2008), a Pixar animator who had worked on \"Ratatouille\" and died of a heart attack before \"WALL-E\"s release.\n\nWalt Disney Imagineering (WDI) built animatronic WALL-Es to promote the picture, which made appearances at Disneyland Resort, the Franklin Institute, the Miami Science Museum, the Seattle Center, and the Tokyo International Film Festival. Due to safety concerns, the 318 kg robots were always strictly controlled and WDI always needed to know exactly what they were required to interact with. For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot. Those who wanted to take a photograph with the character had to make do with a cardboard cutout.\n\nThe movie was not allowed to be screened in theaters in the People's Republic of China by authorities there.\n\nSmall quantities of merchandise were sold for \"WALL-E\", as \"Cars\" items were still popular, and many manufacturers were more interested in \"Speed Racer\", which was a successful line despite the film's failure at the box office. Thinkway, which created the \"WALL-E\" toys, had previously made \"Toy Story\" dolls when other toy producers had not shown an interest. Among Thinkway's items were a WALL-E that danced when connected to a music player, a toy that could be taken apart and reassembled, and a groundbreaking remote control toy of him and EVE that had motion sensors that allowed them to interact with players. There were even plushies. The \"Ultimate WALL-E\" figures were not in stores until the film's home release in November 2008, at a retail price of almost $200, leading \"The Patriot-News\" to deem it an item for \"hard-core fans and collectors only\". On February 4, 2015, Lego announced that a WALL-E custom built by lead animator Angus MacLane was the latest design approved for mass production and release as part of Lego Ideas.\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on November 18, 2008. The various editions included the short film \"Presto\", another short film \"BURN-E\" (which is about the lamp repairing robot briefly seen in \"WALL-E\"), the Leslie Iwerks documentary film \"The Pixar Story\", shorts about the history of Buy n Large, behind-the-scenes special features, and a Digital Copy of the film that can be played through iTunes or Windows Media and compatible devices. This release sold 9,042,054 DVD units ($142,633,974) in total becoming the second best-selling animated DVD among those released in 2008 in units sold (behind \"Kung Fu Panda\"), the best-selling animated feature in sales revenue, and the third best-selling among all 2008 DVD's.\n\n\"WALL-E\" grossed $223.8 million in the USA and Canada and $309.5 million overseas for a worldwide total of $533.3 million making it the ninth highest grossing film of 2008.\n\nThe film premiered at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on June 23, 2008.\n\nIn the US and Canada, it opened in 3,992 theaters on June 27, 2008. During its opening weekend, it topped the box office with $63,087,526 making this the fifth-best opening weekend for a Pixar film and the fourth-best opening among films released in June. The movie earned $94.7 million in its first week and crossed the $200 million mark during its sixth weekend.\n\n\"WALL-E\" grossed over $10 million in Japan ($44,005,222), UK, Ireland and Malta ($41,215,600), France and the Maghreb region ($27,984,103), Germany ($24,130,400), Mexico ($17,679,805), Spain ($14,973,097), Australia ($14,165,390), Italy ($12,210,993), and Russia and the CIS ($11,694,482).\n\nThe American Film Institute named \"WALL-E\" as one of the best films of 2008; the jury rationale states:\n\n\"WALL•E\" proves to this generation and beyond that the film medium's only true boundaries are the human imagination. Writer/director Andrew Stanton and his team have created a classic screen character from a metal trash compactor who rides to the rescue of a planet buried in the debris that embodies the broken promise of American life. Not since Chaplin's \"Little Tramp\" has so much story—so much emotion—been conveyed without words. When hope arrives in the form of a seedling, the film blossoms into one of the great screen romances as two robots remind audiences of the beating heart in all of us that yearns for humanity—and love—in the darkest of landscapes.\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 96% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 253 reviews, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Wall-E's stellar visuals testify once again to Pixar's ingenuity, while its charming star will captivate younger viewers -- and its timely story offers thought-provoking subtext.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 95 based on 39 representing \"universal acclaim\". indieWire named \"WALL-E\" the third best film of the year based on their annual survey of 100 film critics, while Movie City News shows that \"WALL-E\" appeared in 162 different Top 10 lists, out of 286 different critics lists surveyed, the most mentions on a Top 10 list of any film released in 2008.\n\nRichard Corliss of \"Time\" named \"WALL-E\" his favorite film of 2008 (and later of the decade), noting the film succeeded in \"connect[ing] with a huge audience\" despite the main characters' lack of speech and \"emotional signifiers like a mouth, eyebrows, shoulders, [and] elbows\". It \"evoke[d] the splendor of the movie past\" and he also compared WALL-E and EVE's relationship to the chemistry of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Other critics who named \"WALL-E\" their favorite film of 2008 included Tom Charity of CNN, Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\", Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\", A. O. Scott of \"The New York Times\", Christopher Orr of \"The New Republic\", Ty Burr and Wesley Morris of \"The Boston Globe\", Joe Morgenstern of \"The Wall Street Journal\", and Anthony Lane of \"The New Yorker\".\n\nTodd McCarthy of \"Variety\" called the film \"Pixar's ninth consecutive wonder\", saying it was imaginative yet straightforward. He said it pushed the boundaries of animation by balancing esoteric ideas with more immediately accessible ones, and that the main difference between the film and other science fiction projects rooted in an apocalypse was its optimism. Kirk Honeycutt of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" declared that \"WALL-E\" surpassed the achievements of Pixar's previous eight features and probably their most original film to date. He said it had the \"heart, soul, spirit and romance\" of the best silent films. Honeycutt said the film's definitive stroke of brilliance was in using a mix of archive film footage and computer graphics to trigger WALL-E's romantic leanings. He praised Burtt's sound design, saying \"If there is such a thing as an aural sleight of hand, this is it.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" named \"WALL-E\" \"an enthralling animated film, a visual wonderment, and a decent science-fiction story\" and said the scarcity of dialogue would allow it to \"cross language barriers\" in a manner appropriate to the global theme, and noted it would appeal to adults and children. He praised the animation, describing the color palette as \"bright and cheerful [...] and a little bit realistic\", and that Pixar managed to generate a \"curious\" regard for the WALL-E, comparing his \"rusty and hard-working and plucky\" design favorably to more obvious attempts at creating \"lovable\" lead characters. He said \"WALL-E\" was concerned with ideas rather than spectacle, saying it would trigger stimulating \"little thoughts for the younger viewers.\" He named it as one of his twenty favorite films of 2008 and argued it was \"the best science-fiction movie in years\".\n\nThe film was interpreted as tackling a topical, ecologically-minded agenda, though McCarthy said it did so with a lightness of touch that granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message. Kyle Smith of the \"New York Post\", wrote that by depicting future humans as \"a flabby mass of peabrained idiots who are literally too fat to walk\", \"WALL-E\" was darker and more cynical than any major Disney feature film he could recall. He compared the humans to the patrons of Disney's Parks and Resorts, adding, \"I'm also not sure I've ever seen a major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers.\" Maura Judkis of \"U.S. News & World Report\" questioned whether this depiction of \"frighteningly obese humans\" would resonate with children and make them prefer to \"play outside rather than in front of the computer, to avoid a similar fate\". The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, and contributors to \"National Review Online\" including Shannen W. Coffin and Jonah Goldberg (although he admitted it was a \"fascinating\" and occasionally \"brilliant\" production).\n\nA few notable critics have argued that the film is vastly overrated, claiming it failed to \"live up to such blinding, high-wattage enthusiasm\", and that there were \"chasms of boredom watching it\", in particular \"the second and third acts spiraled into the expected\". Other labels included \"preachy\" and \"too long\". Child reviews sent into CBBC were mixed, some citing boredom and an inadequate storyline.\n\nPatrick J. Ford of \"The American Conservative\" said \"WALL-E\"s conservative critics missed lessons in the film that he felt appealed to traditional conservatism. He argued that the mass consumerism in the film was not shown to be a product of big business, but of too close a tie between big business and big government: \"The government unilaterally provided its citizens with everything they needed, and this lack of variety led to Earth's downfall.\" Responding to Coffin's claim that the film points out the evils of mankind, Ford argued the only evils depicted were those that resulted from losing touch with our own humanity and that fundamental conservative representations such as the farm, the family unit, and wholesome entertainment were in the end held aloft by the human characters. He concluded, \"By steering conservative families away from \"WALL-E\", these commentators are doing their readers a great disservice.\"\n\nDirector Terry Gilliam praised the film as \"A stunning bit of work. The scenes on what was left of planet Earth are just so beautiful: one of the great silent movies. And the most stunning artwork! It says more about ecology and society than any live action film—all the people on their loungers floating around, brilliant stuff. Their social comment was so smart and right on the button.\"\n\nArchaeologists have commented on the themes of human evolution that the film explores. Ben Marwick has written how the character of WALL-E resembles an archaeologist with his methodical collection and classification of quotidian human artefacts. He is shown facing a typological dilemma of classifying a spork as either a fork or spoon, and his nostalgic interest in the human past further demonstrated by his attachment to repeated viewings of the 1969 film \"Hello, Dolly!\". Marwick notes that the film features major human evolutionary transitions such as obligate bipedalism (captain of the spaceship struggles with the autopilot to gain control of the vessel) and the invention of agriculture, as part of watershed moments in the story of the film. According to Marwick, one prominent message of the film \"appears to be that the envelopment by technology that the humans in \"Wall-E\" experience paradoxically results in physical and cultural devolution.\" Scholars such as Ian Tattersall and Steve Jones have similarly discussed scenarios where elements of modern technology (such as medicine) may have caused human evolution to slow or stop.\n\n\"WALL-E\" won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing at the 81st Academy Awards, which it lost to \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (Original Score, Original Song, Sound Mixing), \"The Dark Knight\" (Sound Editing), and \"Milk\" (Original Screenplay). Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination, but it was not nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted \"WALL-E\" to the Best Animated Feature category. Peter Travers commented that \"If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E.\" Only three animated films, 1991's \"Beauty and the Beast\" and Pixar's next two films, 2009's \"Up\" and 2010's \"Toy Story 3\", have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. A reflective Stanton stated he was not disappointed the film was restricted to the Best Animated Film nomination because he was overwhelmed by the film's positive reception, and eventually \"The line [between live-action and animation] is just getting so blurry that I think with each proceeding year, it's going to be tougher and tougher to say what's an animated movie and what's not an animated movie.\"\n\n\"WALL-E\" made a healthy appearance at the various 2008 end-of-the-year awards circles, particularly in the Best Picture category, where animated films are often overlooked. It has won the award, or the equivalent of it, from the Boston Society of Film Critics (tied with \"Slumdog Millionaire\"), the Chicago Film Critics Association, the Central Ohio Film Critics awards, the Online Film Critics Society, and most notably the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, where it became the first animated feature to win the prestigious award. It was named as one of 2008's ten best films by the American Film Institute and the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.\n\nIt won Best Animated Feature Film at the 66th Golden Globe Awards, 81st Academy Awards, and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards 2008. It was nominated for several awards at the 2009 Annie Awards, including Best Feature Film, Animated Effects, Character Animation, Direction, Production design, Storyboarding and Voice acting (for Ben Burtt); but was beaten out by \"Kung Fu Panda\" in every category. It won Best Animated Feature at the 62nd British Academy Film Awards and was also nominated there for Best Music and Sound. Thomas Newman and Peter Gabriel won two Grammy Awards for \"Down to Earth\" and \"Define Dancing\". It won all three awards it was nominated for by the Visual Effects Society: Best Animation, Best Character Animation (for WALL-E and EVE in the truck) and Best Effects in the Animated Motion Picture categories. It became the first animated film to win Best Editing for a Comedy or Musical from the American Cinema Editors. In 2009, Stanton, Reardon, and Docter won the Nebula Award, beating \"The Dark Knight\" and the \"Stargate Atlantis\" episode \"The Shrine\". It won Best Animated Film and was nominated for Best Director at the Saturn Awards.\n\nAt the British National Movie Awards, which is voted for by the public, it won Best Family Film. It was also voted Best Feature Film at the British Academy Children's Awards. WALL-E was listed at #63 on \"Empire\"s online poll of the 100 greatest movie characters, conducted in 2008. In early 2010, \"TIME\" ranked \"WALL-E\" #1 in \"Best Movies of the Decade\". In \"Sight & Sound\" magazine's 2012 poll of the greatest films of all time, \"WALL-E\" is the second highest ranking animated film behind \"My Neighbor Totoro\" (1988), while tying with the film \"Spirited Away\" (2001) at 202nd overall. In a 2016 BBC poll of international critics, it was voted the 29th greatest film since 2000.\n\nIt was nominated for the 2009 Kids' Choice Awards, but lost to \"\".\n\nIn 2012, Mike McMaster, an American robotics hobbyist, began working on his own model of WALL-E. The final product was built with more moving parts than the WALL-E which roams around Disneyland. McMaster's four-foot robot made an appearance at the Walt Disney Family Museum and was featured during the opening week of Tested.com a project headed up by Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage of \"MythBusters\". Since WALL-E's creation, Mike and the popular robot have made dozens of appearances at various events.\n\nIn the same year, Mike Senna completed his own WALL-E build. He also created an EVE. They were present at a photo op at Disney's D23 Expo 2015.\n\n\n"}
