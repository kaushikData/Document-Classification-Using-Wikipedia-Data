He was the Melkite bishop of Manbij (Mabbug, Hierapolis Bambyce), in Syria.\n\nHe was a contemporary of the annalist Eutychius (=Said al-Bitriq), also a Melchite. His history commences with the foundation of the world and runs up to his own times. The portion dealing with the Arabic period is extant only in a single manuscript and breaks off in the second year of the Caliphate of al-Mahdi (160AH = 776-7 AD) and during the time when Emperor was Leo IV (775-780).\n\nFor the early history of Christianity, Agapius made use uncritically of apocryphal and legendary materials. For the following secular and ecclesiastical history, he relied on Syriac sources, in particular the World Chronicle of the Maronite historian Theophilus of Edessa (d. 785) for the end of the Ummayad period and the beginning of the Abbasids. He made use of Eusebius's \"Church History\" only through an intermediary compilation of short extracts. This he supplements from other sources. He gives an otherwise unknown fragment of Papias; and a list of Eastern Metropolitans. He uses the lost History of Bardaisan, but many of his sources remain unknown.\n\nThe \"History\" has been published with a French translation in the Patrologia Orientalis series and with a Latin translation in the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium series.\n\nHis history contains an interesting version of the Testimonium Flavianum.\n\n\n\n"}

A winner of the Pulitzer Prize, she has written extensively about Marxism-Leninism and the development of civil society in Central and Eastern Europe. She is a visiting Professor of Practice at the London School of Economics, where she runs Arena, a project on propaganda and disinformation. She has also been an editor at \"The Economist\" and \"The Spectator\", and a member of the editorial board of \"The Washington Post\" (2002–06).\n\nApplebaum was born in Washington, D.C. Her parents are Harvey M. Applebaum, a partner in the Covington and Burling law firm, and Elizabeth (Bloom) Applebaum, of the Corcoran Gallery of Art. Applebaum has stated that she was brought up in a \"very reformed\" Jewish family. Her ancestors came to America from what is now Belarus. She graduated from the Sidwell Friends School (1982). She earned a BA (summa cum laude) in history and literature at Yale University (1986), where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. As a Marshall Scholar at the London School of Economics she earned a master's degree in international relations (1987). She studied at St Antony's College, Oxford, before moving to Warsaw, Poland, in 1988 as a correspondent for \"The Economist\".\n\nFrom 1988, Applebaum wrote about the collapse of communism from Warsaw. Working for \"The Economist\" and \"The Independent\", she provided front-page and cover stories of important social and political transitions in Central and Eastern Europe, both before and after the Fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In 1994 she published her first book, \"Between East and West\", a travelogue describing the rise of nationalism in the Western republics of the Soviet Union. The book was awarded an Adolph Bentinck Prize in 1996.\n\nApplebaum worked briefly as the Africa editor of \"The Economist\" in 1992. In 1993, she left the paper and became the foreign editor and then the deputy editor at \"The Spectator\" where she wrote about British and international politics, writing cover stories from Brussels, Moscow, Washington and Milan as well as London. She also wrote regular columns for both \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"Sunday Telegraph\" in London. In 1996 and 1997 Applebaum wrote exclusively about Britain, and in particular the victory of Tony Blair’s Labour Party, as the political columnist for London's \"Evening Standard\" newspaper.\n\nApplebaum returned to Poland in 1998, where she continued to write for the \"Sunday Telegraph\" and other newspapers. In 2001 she did a major interview with prime minister Tony Blair. She also began doing historical research for her book \"\" (2003), on the Soviet concentration camp system, which won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction. It was also nominated for a National Book Award, for the LA Times book award and for the National Book Critics Circle Award. It was eventually translated into more than 25 languages.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005, Applebaum lived in Washington where she was a member of \"The Washington Post\" editorial board. She wrote about a wide range of US policy issues, including healthcare, social security and education. [links] She also began writing a column for \"The Washington Post\", which continues to the present. Applebaum was also briefly an adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank.\n\nReturning to Europe in 2005, Applebaum was a George Herbert Walker Bush/Axel Springer Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin, Germany, in 2006.\n\nHer second history book, \"Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944–56\", was published in 2012 by Doubleday in the USA and Allen Lane in the UK; it was nominated for a National Book Award, shortlisted for the 2013 PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award and won the Cundill Prize for Historical Literature as well as the Duke of Westminster Medal.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2016, she created and ran the Transitions Forum at the Legatum Institute, an international think tank and educational charity based in London. Among other projects, she ran a two-year program examining the relationship between democracy and growth in Brazil, India and South Africa, created the Future of Syria and Future of Iran projects, on future institutional change in those two countries; commissioned a series of papers on corruption in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.\n\nTogether with Foreign Policy magazine she created Democracy Lab, a website which focused on countries in transition to, or away from, democracy and which has since become Democracy Post at \"The Washington Post\". She also ran Beyond Propaganda a program examining 21st century propaganda and disinformation. Started in 2014, the program anticipated later debates about “fake news.”\n\nAt the end of 2016, she left Legatum because of its stance on Brexit and joined the London School of Economics as a Professor of Practice at the Institute for Global Affairs. At the LSE she runs Arena, a program on disinformation and 21st century propaganda.\n\nOn February 21, 2014, Applebaum wrote in \"The Daily Telegraph\", documenting the breakdown in law and order in Ukraine over the previous fortnight. She concluded that it \"is not a war, or even a conflict which either side can win with weapons. It will have to be solved through negotiations, elections, political debate; by civic organisations, political parties and political leaders, both charismatic and otherwise; with the participation of other European states and Ukraine's other neighbors\".\n\nApplebaum has been a vocal critic of Western conduct regarding the 2014 Crimean crisis. In an article in \"The Washington Post\" on March 5, she maintained that the US and its allies should not continue to enable \"the existence of a corrupt Russian regime that is destabilizing Europe,\" noting that the actions of Putin had violated \"a series of international treaties\".\n\nOn March 7, in another \"Telegraph\" article, discussing an information war, Applebaum argued that \"a robust campaign to tell the truth about Crimea is needed to counter Moscow's lies\". At the end of August she asked whether Ukraine should prepare for \"total war\" with Russia and whether central Europeans should join them.\n\nIn March 2016, six months before the election of President Trump, she wrote a column asking, “Is this the end of the West as we know it?” which argued that “we are two or three bad elections away from the end of NATO, the end of the European Union and maybe the end of the liberal world order”. Considered unduly gloomy at the time, the column inspired the Swiss magazine \"Tagesanzeiger \"and the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" to interview Applebaum in December 2016 and January 2017. She argued very early on that the movement had an international dimension, that populist groups in Europe share “ideas and ideology, friends and founders,” and that, unlike Burkean conservatives, they seek to “overthrow the institutions of the present to bring back things that existed in the past—or that they believe existed in the past—by force.”\n\nApplebaum has been writing about Russia since the early 1990s. In 2000, she described the links between the then-new president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, with the former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov and the old KGB. In 2008 she began speaking about “Putinism” as an anti-democratic ideology, though most at the time still considered the Russian president to be a pro-Western pragmatist. Applebaum has also focused on Russia’s failure to come to terms with the legacy of the USSR and of Stalin, both in her Gulag book and in other writing and speeches. In 2014, she asked whether “the most important story of the past twenty years might not, in fact, have been the failure of democracy, but the rise of a new form of Russian authoritarianism.\" She has described the “myth of Russian humiliation” and argued that Nato and EU expansion have been a “phenomenal success.” In July 2016, before the US election, she was one of the first American journalists to write about the significance of Russia’s ties to Donald Trump and to point out that Russian support for Trump is part of a wider Russian political campaign, designed to destabilize the West. She has also written that a summer spent as a student in Leningrad in 1985 has helped shape her views.\n\nApplebaum has written extensively about the history of central and eastern Europe, Poland in particular. In the conclusion to her book Iron Curtain, Applebaum argued that the reconstruction of civil society was the most important and most difficult challenge for the post-communist states of central Europe; in another essay, she argued that the modern authoritarian obsession with civil society repression dates back to Lenin. More broadly, she has written essays on the Polish film-maker Andrzej Wajda, on the dual Nazi-Soviet occupation of central Europe, and on why it is inaccurate to define “Eastern Europe” as a single entity.\n\nIn 2014, Applebaum and Peter Pomerantzev launched Beyond Propaganda, a program examining disinformation and propaganda, at the Legatum Institute. In 2016, they expanded the program, renamed it Arena, moved it to the LSE and began piloting solutions to the problem. Applebaum has written that a 2014 Russian smear campaign, aimed at her, first taught her the techniques of modern Russian propaganda. That campaign was promoted by Wikileaks. Applebaum argued in 2015 that Facebook should take responsibility for spreading false stories and help “undo the terrible damage done by Facebook and other forms of social media to democratic debate and civilized discussion all over the world.”\n\nApplebaum is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She is on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy. She was a member of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting's International Board of Directors. She is a Senior Adjunct Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) where she co-leads a major initiative aimed at countering Russian disinformation in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). She is on the editorial board for \"The American Interest\" and the \"Journal of Democracy\".\n\nIn 1992 Applebaum married Radosław Sikorski, who would later serve as Poland's Defence Minister, Foreign Minister, and Marshal of the Sejm. They have two sons, Aleksander and Tomasz. She became a Polish citizen in 2013. She speaks Polish and Russian in addition to English.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47002086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47002086", "title": "Barbu Lăzăreanu", "text": "Barbu Lăzăreanu\n\nBarbu Lăzăreanu (born Avram Lazarovici, also known as Barbou Lazareano or Barbu Lăzărescu; October 5, 1881 – January 19, 1957) was a Romanian literary historian, bibliographer, and left-wing activist. Of Romanian Jewish background, he became noted for both his social criticism and his lyrical pieces while still in high school. His socialist-and-anarchist advocacy made him a target of the conservative establishment, which expelled him from the country in 1907. Lăzăreanu spent five years studying in France, then returned to Romania as a publicist, columnist, and workers' educator. He earned the reputation of a highly focused literary researcher and biographer, noted as the editor of works by Ion Luca Caragiale and Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea.\n\nBy 1933, Lăzăreanu was a public critic of fascism, a fact which contributed to his persecution by the antisemitic far-right in the 1940s. Having narrowly escaped a deportation to Transnistria and a likely death in 1942, he returned to public life after the 1944 Coup and subsequent democratization. He rose to prominence post-1948, under the Romanian communist regime, first as a rector of Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy, then as a member of the Romanian Academy and its Presidium. Lăzăreanu spent his final decade as a decorated and lionized writer and political forerunner of the regime.\n\nThe future author, primarily known in his early years as \"Bubi\" Lazarovici, was born in Botoșani as the son of Herschel Lazarovici. As later noted by Traian Săvulescu, his first home was the southern, poorer part of town, where Avram grew up \"revolted by injustice and with a burning desire to rectify it.\" He attended primary school and A. T. Laurian High School in his native town, while becoming acquainted with Marxism through his perusing of \"Contemporanul\" review and, as noted by his official obituary of 1957, making a name for himself as a \"propagandist of such ideas.\" His first contribution to the Romanian labor movement was taking part in a bakers' strike at Botoșani, and, in early 1899, the Laurian High School expelled him for his socialist agitation.\n\nLazarovici debuted as a poet in his own magazine, \"Victor Hugo\", where he also printed a manifesto in verse against aestheticism. His first work in satirical prose was hosted by George Ranetti's paper, \"Zeflemeaua\", after which he became a regular contributor to the left-wing review \"România Muncitoare\". After \"Victor Hugo\", he persisted in trying to establish a lasting newspaper of his own, putting out \"Gândul\" (\"The Thought\", 1902), then \"Inima și Mintea\" (\"Heart and Mind\", 1903). By 1905, he was in Bucharest, co-opted by Constantin Mille to write for \"Adevărul\", with a series of rhyming columns that he signed as \"Trubadur\".\n\nWith his Romanian-sounding adoptive surname, Lăzăreanu had poems hosted in A. D. Xenopol's \"Arhiva\" of Iași. Contemplative and rustic, such pieces brought him to the attention of A. C. Cuza, a traditionalist and antisemitic poet-doctrinaire, who was unaware of Lăzăreanu's Jewishness. Cuza traveled to Botoșani just to greet the \"national troubadour\", only to be informed that \"it is the Jew's Lazarovici's boy [...] who is as shriveled as a raisin, and who looks at the moon like a somnambulist\". His other poetry included stanzas honoring those killed in the 1905 Russian Revolution, published in \"Viitorul Social\" of Iași. Participating in socialist shows of solidarity with the Russian workers, he was by then drawn into anarchist circles, and for a while co-publisher of Panait Mușoiu's newspaper, \"Revista Ideei\". As an ally of Mușoiu's, by 1907 he was tutoring Bucharest workers, giving them lessons in Romanian grammar and literature, and also \"educating them politically\".\nIn 1906, he founded the satirical weekly \"Țivil-Cazon\" (\"Civilian-Conscript\"), for which he used the pseudonym \"Bélé\". The magazine hosted the work of Ioachim Botez, Ioan Dragomirescu-Dragion, Leon Wechsler-Vero, and Victor Eftimiu, who was also a pseudonymous co-editor. Eftimiu and Lăzăreanu's work for it included rhyming quatrains that parodied or mocked the more serious literary reviews. Eftimiu noted, years later, that Bélé was \"very talented\". \"Țivil-Cazon\" became the first Romanian journal of its kind to feature colored prints, and included artwork by Iosif Iser, Nicolae Petrescu Găină, and Nicolae Mantu. Heavily inspired by Ion Luca Caragiale and his \"Moftul Român\", it mainly targeted Romanian Army personnel, depicted as slow-witted and (especially if cavalry officers) as sex objects.\n\nLăzăreanu was eventually deported from the country shortly after the 1907 peasants' revolt. According to a detailed account of this incident, published in \"Furnica\", Premier Dimitrie Sturdza had read Lăzăreanu's work in \"Zeflemeaua\", and had decided to punish his insolence. Săvulescu has it that Lăzăreanu \"had merely helped the peasants\" of Gorbănești petition King Carol I, and that this was read as \"anarchist propaganda against throne and religion\". Lăzăreanu was allegedly arrested at Colentina Hospital, having suffered a nervous breakdown. The expulsion was facilitated by Lăzăreanu's Jewish ethnicity: under the still-restrictive laws of the Romanian Kingdom, he was classified as \"heimatlos\".\n\nFrom 1907 to 1912, he lived in France, where he was admitted by examination to the Paris-based École des Hautes Études. There, he took courses with Sylvain Lévi and Charles Diehl, and between 1908 and 1909 was a classmate of the future historian Orest Tafrali. He was published in the French socialist press, as well as, back home, in Christian Rakovski's \"Viitorul Social\" and in Barbu Nemțeanu's \"Pagini Libere\". Lăzăreanu helped establish a socialist association of Romanian guest workers, and, with fellow Botoșani exile Deodat Țăranu, joined the Romanian socialist students' society in Paris. On May 10, 1908 (Romania's royal holiday), he and the worker Radu Florescu directed an intentional protest against King Carol, later hosting and giving exposure to their fellow socialist exile, Rakovsky. On May 28, 1910, Lăzăreanu stood on the \"revolutionary jury\" which \"tried\" the Romanian anarchist Adolf Reichmann, suspected of being an \"agent provocateur\". He deemed Reichmann not guilty.\n\nUpon his return to Romania, Lăzăreanu, sometimes passing himself off as \"Matei Rareș\", \"Trubadurul\", or \"Alexandru B. Trudă\", was an editor at the magazines \"Înfrățirea\", \"Viitorul Social\", \"Lupta Zilnică\", and \"Adevărul Literar\". He was still a contributor to the left-wing dailies \"Adevărul\" and \"Dimineața\", and eventually also their cultural editor. In 1915, using the pen name \"Arald\", he was featured in the pages of \"Rampa\" magazine. Shortly before World War I, he was again involved in the Romanian labor movement. With I. C. Frimu of the Social Democratic Party (PSDR), he established a \"workers' university\" in Bucharest, where he then taught literature and the history of socialism. His first book of literary portraits appeared in 1917, as \"Constantin Radovici, Agatha Bârsescu, Nora Marinescu\". Despite his growing reputation, Lăzăreanu, like other Jewish professionals, was barred from joining the Romanian Writers' Society (SSR).\n\nLăzăreanu, noted for a while as a publisher of anti-war literature, remained in German-occupied Bucharest after 1916. He was a member of the underground PSDR and guest speaker at its defiant Labor Day picnic (May 1, 1917), and reportedly became a Leninist shortly after the October Revolution in Russia. Meanwhile, writing for \"Scena\" review, usually as \"Alex. Bucur\" or \"Mathieu H. Rareșiu\", he met and befriended writer I. Peltz, who recalled that his \"little essays\" on literature, \"of greatest interest to the reading public\", took up most of Lăzăreanu's time, preventing him from publishing his poetry. Peltz also recalls Lăzăreanu's satire of \"the oligarchy\", noting him as an \"elegant polemicist\" of \"fine humor\". His tireless glossing of texts earned accolades from Perpessicius, who described Lăzăreanu as \"all-knowing\" and \"without rival\". A posthumous reviewer, Marin Bucur, was unimpressed. He describes Lăzăreanu as a scholar who missed out on \"the general layout\", focused on documenting \"infinitesimal\" aspects of history, including \"trifles\" and \"bromides\".\n\nFollowing the war and the creation of Greater Romania, Lăzăreanu maintained a profile in the labor and socialist movements. A speaker at the funeral of Marxist doyen Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, he was closely followed by agents of the \"Siguranța\", who noted his association with labor organizer Herșcu Aroneanu, \"a very dangerous element\". Joining the postwar Socialist Party, he returned to his native region during the 1919 paper mill workers' strike, which Aroneanu assisted, and again during the 1920 commemoration of the Paris Commune. Lăzăreanu also became editor of the Socialist Party organ, \"Socialismul\", putting out its cultural pages. He still contributed biographies of socialist leaders as the newspaper became official organ of the new Romanian Communist Party (May 1921), before the both the party and newspaper were outlawed. He also had contributions as a poet and scholar in the magazines \"Progresele Științei\" and \"Presa Dentară\". His other work appeared in \"Flacăra\", \"Viața Românească\", \"Vremea\", \"Contimporanul\", \"Revista Literară\", \"Mântuirea\", \"Adam\", \"Luptătorul\", \"Curierul\", and \"Revista Idealistă\".\n\nFrom 1919 to 1930, Lăzăreanu resumed his work in popular education, reestablishing the workers' university, joining the Căile Ferate Române unions' school in Grivița, and becoming staff member for the Union of Romanian Jews People's University. Although he worked in political and trade-union journalism, as well as a philologist and bibliographer, he was primarily a commentator on Romanian literature. Writing about numerous authors who included Caragiale, Mihai Eminescu, Gheorghe Asachi, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, Anton Pann, and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, his book titles for the early 1920s usually began \"Cu privire la...\" (\"With a Look at...\"). In 1922, Lăzăreanu annotated, prefaced and edited Caragiale's satiric verses, grouped into poetic cycles. The work was poorly reviewed by his colleagues in the literary press, who noted that Caragiale himself had made efforts to erase all memory of his work in verse. Lăzăreanu defended himself with chronicles in \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\", arguing that the Caragiale poems had documentary and, \"sometimes\", artistic value. Some 12 years after, Lăzăreanu received public thanks from Paul Zarifopol, Caragiale's friend and biographer: \"neither the richness and exactitude of his knowledge, nor the kindness with which he imparts it, have an end.\"\n\nWriting mainly for \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\", Lăzăreanu discovered and published poetry by politicians such as Take Ionescu, Gheorghe Nădejde, and Constantin Istrati, also republishing 19th-century tracts by Jean Alexandre Vaillant and physician Alcibiade Tavernier, and documenting the minutae of Hasdeu's literary and political activity. He also held a column on phonaesthetics, and completed in print a historical review of the Romanian Communards and their sympathizers. Known to his Romanian peers as an \"incidental\" but noteworthy medical historian, his 1924 collection of essays bridged philology and health historiography, as: \"Lespezi și moloz din templul lui Epidaur\" (\"Slabs and Debris from Epidaurus' Temple\"). He also studied folkloristics and historical linguistics, focusing especially on \"the destiny of some words\", and involved himself in literary and political polemics with liberal conservatives—Mihail Dragomirescu, Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, and the \"Ideea Europeană\" writers.\n\nOver the following years, he researched and edited several volumes of essays by Dobrogeanu-Gherea, issuing, as part of the \"Dobrogeanu-Gherea Collection\", the socialist poetry of Dumitru Theodor Neculuță and Anton Bacalbașa, and the biography of Ottoi Călin (\"Doctorul Ottoi\"). His 1924 review of \"various raconteurs\" (\"Câțiva povestitori\") included monographs on Ion Creangă and N. D. Popescu-Popnedea. His critical verdicts were dismissed by Bucur, who described the book as \"puerile\" and \"glib\", and later by Ioana Pârvulescu, who sees Lăzăreanu as \"a minor, socialist literato [who] did not shy away from distorting literary reality\". In 1927, he published at \"Adevărul\" an overview of Hasdeu's humorous writings (\"Umorul lui Hajdeu\"). Originally a report to the Romanian Academy, it was noted for its satirical tinges and a slight mockery of its protagonist. Also that year, Lăzăreanu put out an ethnographic study of courtship (\"Ursitul fetelor și al vădanelor\").\n\nIn the 1930s, Lăzăreanu became a committed anti-fascist, and one of the main contributors to Petre Pandrea's left-wing review, \"Cuvântul Liber\". In 1936, the Communist Party attracted him into a semi-legal National Antifascist Committee, where he became colleagues with Iorgu Iordan, Sandu Eliad, and Petre Constantinescu-Iași. His other focus was on researching Romanian folklore, touring the country to lecture the public on related topics, billed alongside Peltz and S. Podoleanu. In 1936, he wrote in \"Adevărul\" an homage to the Romanian Jewish linguist Moses Gaster.\n\nLăzăreanu was sidelined during the antisemitic ascendancy of the National Christian Party (1937), but returned to favor under the National Renaissance Front (1938): although fascist in nature, the latter stipended leftist and Jewish intellectuals, protected by Mihai Ralea, the Labor Minister. Like other men from Ralea's circle, he remained a regular contributor to \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\", the sole leftist review still tolerated by the regime. He also frequented Petre V. Haneș's \"Preocupări Literare\" society, where he lectured about early Romanian translations from Molière. In 1938, he published his final \"Cu privire la...\" volume, focused on George Coșbuc, followed in 1940 by an introduction to the work of Constantin Graur and a history of the \"Libertatea\" socialist club. Nevertheless, having since obtained Romanian citizenship, he was stripped of it during the passage of racial laws.\n\nAs the country plunged into World War II alongside the Axis powers, Lăzăreanu was again exposed to racial and political persecution. He was placed under constant surveillance by the Ion Antonescu regime, and his collection of documents in Botoșani was presumed looted. Publication and circulation of his work was explicitly banned, but, reportedly, he continued to \"speak passionately and resolutely at intimate reunions\", condemning war on the Eastern Front. In October 1942, he was arrested with other Jews and scheduled to be deported to Transnistria Governorate, but was spared thanks to the interventions of Queen Helen and a Romanian physician, Victor Gomoiu.\n\nAfter the fall of Antonescu in August 1944, Lăzăreanu became a visible associate (later member) of the Communist Party, contributing to its main organs: \"România Liberă\", \"Scînteia\", \"Studii\". From 1945 to 1948, he served as the inaugural rector of the new Workers' University in Bucharest, which became the Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy under his tenure. In his inaugural speech, Lăzăreanu declared the school to be one of a fundamentally new type, with a mission to create the \"new man\"; its curriculum was to be based on the four \"great educators of mankind\": Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, and Joseph Stalin. In May 1945, he was finally elected to the SSR, one of seven Jewish members enlisted on that occasion. On September 18, 1947, he joined Gala Galaction, Victor Eftimiu, Mihail Macavei and others on the leadership board of the Bucharest Atheneum.\n\nHe returned to writing with a Creangă monograph, put out by the Romanian–Russian Relations Library, focusing his research on that writer's debt to Russian fairy tales. The communist party's Section for Political Education hosted his lectures on the \"poets of labor and poets as laborers\", which placed focus on laborist themes in the work of Eminescu or Creangă, and introduced the public to works by Zaharia Boiu, Dumitru Corbea, and Alexandru Toma.\n\nShortly after the Arab–Israeli War, Lăzăreanu gave public endorsement to the Jewish Democratic Committee, which followed a communist platform of anti-Zionism and anti-cosmopolitanism. In 1948, when the new communist regime revamped the Romanian Academy, he was elected a titular member. Lăzăreanu headed the Academy's library, from 1948 to 1957. In 2013, mathematician-writer Mircea Malița recalled that he was actually in charge of the latter, Lăzăreanu's presidency being otherwise \"symbolic\". Nevertheless, Lăzăreanu is alleged to have obtained for the Academy the letters of left-wing novelist Panait Istrati, having coaxed his widow into handing them over.\n\nLăzăreanu was similarly involved, in 1952, with the Romanian orthographic reform, voted in as a member of the Linguistics Institute, and nominally implementing locally the objectives of \"Marxism and Problems of Linguistics\". He published in 1950 an anthology of anti-monarchic literature, which went through two more editions by 1957. He returned to socialist historiography and reissued as a book his earlier study on the Romanian Communards. His other work was in early-readers' literature, with the book \"Dan inimosul\" (\"Hearty Dan\"). Although a representative of the new regime, in 1950 he signed a public protest in support of his friend Peltz, who had been exposed as a \"Siguranța\" informant and was facing communist imprisonment.\n\nIn January 1952, his 70th anniversary was marked by an official ceremony at the Academy. Săvulescu, the Academy president, saluted him as a Romanian version of Milkman Tevye and Till Eulenspiegel, noting his \"kind and open heart\" and his ability to versify any situation; his speech also doubled as an attack on cosmopolitanism, praising Lăzăreanu's \"socialist patriotism\". Before his death in January 1957, Lăzăreanu had served several times in the Academy Presidium. He was also a recipient of the Star of the People's Republic of Romania, Second Class, and \"Ordinul Muncii\", First Class. He was survived by son Alexandru Lăzăreanu, who worked as a Head of Department in the Foreign Ministry and was instrumental in obtaining Romania's affiliation to UNESCO and the United Nations.\n\nIncinerated at \"Cenușa\" crematorium, Barbu Lăzăreanu's funeral, including the speeches, was held on the premises and closed with the singing of \"The Internationale\", the highest mark of adherence to the communist ideal. His ashes were deposited near the mausoleum in Carol Park, but his and all other remains at the complex were removed after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Found and preserved by the World Jewish Congress, his documentary collection is housed in New York City.\n\n"}
{"id": "3355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3355", "title": "Benjamin Lee Whorf", "text": "Benjamin Lee Whorf\n\nBenjamin Lee Whorf (; April 24, 1897 – July 26, 1941) was an American linguist and fire prevention engineer. Whorf is widely known as an advocate for the idea that differences between the structures of different languages shape how their speakers perceive and conceptualize the world. This principle has frequently been called the \"Sapir–Whorf hypothesis\", after him and his mentor Edward Sapir, but Whorf called it the principle of linguistic relativity, because he saw the idea as having implications similar to Einstein's principle of physical relativity.\n\nThroughout his life Whorf was a chemical engineer by profession, but as a young man he took up an interest in linguistics. At first this interest drew him to the study of Biblical Hebrew, but he quickly went on to study the indigenous languages of Mesoamerica on his own. Professional scholars were impressed by his work and in 1930 he received a grant to study the Nahuatl language in Mexico; on his return home he presented several influential papers on the language at linguistics conferences.\n\nThis led him to begin studying linguistics with Edward Sapir at Yale University while still maintaining his day job at the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. During his time at Yale he worked on the description of the Hopi language, and the historical linguistics of the Uto-Aztecan languages, publishing many influential papers in professional journals. He was chosen as the substitute for Sapir during his medical leave in 1938. Whorf taught his seminar on \"Problems of American Indian Linguistics\". In addition to his well-known work on linguistic relativity, he wrote a grammar sketch of Hopi and studies of Nahuatl dialects, proposed a deciphering of Maya hieroglyphic writing, and published the first attempt towards a reconstruction of Uto-Aztecan.\n\nAfter his death from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his linguist friends who also worked to spread the influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he became the subject of harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.\n\nIn the late 20th century, interest in Whorf's ideas experienced a resurgence, and a new generation of scholars began reading Whorf's works, arguing that previous critiques had only engaged superficially with Whorf's actual ideas, or had attributed to him ideas he had never expressed. The field of linguistic relativity studies remains an active focus of research in psycholinguistics and linguistic anthropology, and continues to generate debate and controversy between proponents of relativism and proponents of universalism. By comparison, Whorf's other work in linguistics, the development of such concepts as the allophone and the cryptotype, and the formulation of \"Whorf's law\" in Uto-Aztecan historical linguistics, have met with broad acceptance.\n\nThe son of Harry Church Whorf and Sarah Edna Lee Whorf, Benjamin Lee Whorf was born on April 24, 1897 in Winthrop, Massachusetts. Harry Church Whorf was an artist, intellectual and designer – first working as a commercial artist and later as a dramatist. Benjamin had two younger brothers, John and Richard, who both went on to become notable artists. John became an internationally renowned painter and illustrator; Richard was an actor in films such as \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" and later an Emmy-nominated television director of such shows as \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". Benjamin was the intellectual of the three and at a young age he conducted chemical experiments with his father's photographic equipment. He was also an avid reader, interested in botany, astrology, and Middle American prehistory. He read William H. Prescott's \"Conquest of Mexico\" several times. At the age of 17 he began to keep a copious diary in which he recorded his thoughts and dreams.\n\nWhorf graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1918 with a degree in chemical engineering where his academic performance was of average quality. In 1920 he married Celia Inez Peckham, who became the mother of his three children, Raymond Ben, Robert Peckham and Celia Lee. Around the same time he began work as a fire prevention engineer (an inspector) for the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. He was particularly good at the job and was highly commended by his employers. His job required him to travel to production facilities throughout New England to be inspected. One anecdote describes him arriving at a chemical plant in which he was denied access by the director because he would not allow anyone to see the production procedure which was a trade secret. Having been told what the plant produced, Whorf wrote a chemical formula on a piece of paper, saying to the director: \"I think this is what you're doing\". The surprised director asked Whorf how he knew about the secret procedure, and he simply answered: \"You couldn't do it in any other way.\"\n\nWhorf helped to attract new customers to the Fire Insurance Company; they favored his thorough inspections and recommendations. Another famous anecdote from his job was used by Whorf to argue that language use affects habitual behavior. Whorf described a workplace in which full gasoline drums were stored in one room and empty ones in another; he said that because of flammable vapor the \"empty\" drums were more dangerous than those that were full, although workers handled them less carefully to the point that they smoked in the room with \"empty\" drums, but not in the room with full ones. Whorf argued that by habitually speaking of the vapor-filled drums as empty and by extension as inert, the workers were oblivious to the risk posed by smoking near the \"empty drums\".\n\nWhorf was a spiritual man throughout his lifetime although what religion he followed has been the subject of debate. As a young man he produced a manuscript titled \"Why I have discarded evolution\", causing some scholars to describe him as a devout Methodist Episcopalian, who was impressed with fundamentalism, and perhaps supportive of creationism. However, throughout his life Whorf's main religious interest was theosophy, a nonsectarian organization based on Buddhist and Hindu teachings that promotes the view of the world as an interconnected whole and the unity and brotherhood of humankind \"without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color\". Some scholars have argued that the conflict between spiritual and scientific inclinations has been a driving force in Whorf's intellectual development, particularly in the attraction by ideas of linguistic relativity. Some of Whorf's unpublished manuscripts on spirituality also suggest that he was influenced by the ideas of Helena Blavatsky the founder of the Theosophical Society who wrote about cosmic evolution, a belief that regards reincarnation to be the source of evolution of human races towards continuously higher forms. Whorf said that \"of all groups of people with whom I have come in contact, Theosophical people seem the most capable of becoming excited about ideas—new ideas.\"\n\nAround 1924 Whorf first became interested in linguistics. Originally he analyzed Biblical texts, seeking to uncover hidden layers of meaning. Inspired by the esoteric work \"La langue hebraïque restituée\" by Antoine Fabre d'Olivet, he began a semantic and grammatical analysis of Biblical Hebrew. Whorf's early manuscripts on Hebrew and Maya have been described as exhibiting a considerable degree of mysticism, as he sought to uncover esoteric meanings of glyphs and letters.\n\nWhorf studied Biblical linguistics mainly at the Watkinson Library (now Hartford Public Library). This library had an extensive collection of materials about Native American linguistics and folklore, originally collected by James Hammond Trumbull. It was at the Watkinson library that Whorf became friends with the young boy, John B. Carroll, who later went on to study psychology under B. F. Skinner, and who in 1956 edited and published a selection of Whorf's essays as \"Language, Thought and Reality\" . The collection rekindled Whorf's interest in Mesoamerican antiquity. He began studying the Nahuatl language in 1925, and later, beginning in 1928, he studied the collections of Maya hieroglyphic texts. Quickly becoming conversant with the materials, he began a scholarly dialog with Mesoamericanists such as Alfred Tozzer, the Maya archaeologist at Harvard University, and Herbert J. Spinden of the Brooklyn Museum.\n\nIn 1928 he first presented a paper at the International Congress of Americanists in which he presented his translation of a Nahuatl document held at the Peabody Museum at Harvard. He also began to study the comparative linguistics of the Uto-Aztecan language family, which Edward Sapir had recently demonstrated to be a linguistic family. In addition to Nahuatl, Whorf studied the Piman and Tepecano languages, while in close correspondence with linguist J. Alden Mason.\n\nBecause of the promise shown by his work on Uto-Aztecan, Tozzer and Spinden advised Whorf to apply for a grant with the Social Science Research Council (SSRC) to support his research. Whorf considered using the money to travel to Mexico to procure Aztec manuscripts for the Watkinson library, but Tozzer suggested he spend the time in Mexico documenting modern Nahuatl dialects. In his application Whorf proposed to establish the oligosynthetic nature of the Nahuatl language. Before leaving Whorf presented the paper \"Stem series in Maya\" at the Linguistic Society of America conference, in which he argued that in the Mayan languages syllables carry symbolic content. The SSRC awarded Whorf the grant and in 1930 he traveled to Mexico City where Professor Robert H Barlow put him in contact with several speakers of Nahuatl to serve as his informants, among whom were Mariano Rojas of Tepoztlán and Luz Jimenez of Milpa Alta. The outcome of the trip to Mexico was Whorf's sketch of Milpa Alta Nahuatl, published only after his death, and an article on a series of Aztec pictograms found at the Tepozteco monument at Tepoztlán, Morelos in which he noted similarities in form and meaning between Aztec and Maya day signs.\n\nUntil his return from Mexico in 1930 Whorf had been entirely an autodidact in linguistic theory and field methodology, yet he had already made a name for himself in Middle American linguistics. Whorf had met Sapir, the leading US linguist of the day, at professional conferences, and in 1931 Sapir came to Yale from the University of Chicago to take a position as Professor of Anthropology. Alfred Tozzer sent Sapir a copy of Whorf's paper on \"Nahuatl tones and saltillo\". Sapir replied stating that it \"should by all means be published\"; however, it was not until 1993 that it was prepared for publication by Lyle Campbell and Frances Karttunen.\n\nWhorf took Sapir's first course at Yale on \"American Indian Linguistics\". He enrolled in a program of graduate studies, nominally working towards a PhD in linguistics, but he never actually attempted to obtain a degree, satisfying himself with participating in the intellectual community around Sapir. At Yale, Whorf joined the circle of Sapir's students that included such luminary linguists as Morris Swadesh, Mary Haas, Harry Hoijer, G. L. Trager and Charles F. Voegelin. Whorf took on a central role among Sapir's students and was well respected.\n\nSapir had a profound influence on Whorf's thinking. Sapir's earliest writings had espoused views of the relation between thought and language stemming from the Humboldtian tradition he acquired through Franz Boas, which regarded language as the historical embodiment of \"volksgeist\", or ethnic world view. But Sapir had since become influenced by a current of logical positivism, such as that of Bertrand Russell and the early Ludwig Wittgenstein, particularly through Ogden and Richards' \"The Meaning of Meaning\", from which he adopted the view that natural language potentially obscures, rather than facilitates, the mind to perceive and describe the world as it really is. In this view, proper perception could only be accomplished through formal logics. During his stay at Yale, Whorf acquired this current of thought partly from Sapir and partly through his own readings of Russell and Ogden and Richards. As Whorf became more influenced by positivist science he also distanced himself from some approaches to language and meaning that he saw as lacking in rigor and insight. One of these was Polish philosopher Alfred Korzybski's General semantics, which was espoused in the US by Stuart Chase. Chase admired Whorf's work and frequently sought out a reluctant Whorf, who considered Chase to be \"utterly incompetent by training and background to handle such a subject.\" Ironically, Chase would later write the foreword for Carroll's collection of Whorf's writings.\n\nSapir also encouraged Whorf to continue his work on the historical and descriptive linguistics of Uto-Aztecan. Whorf published several articles on that topic in this period, some of them with G. L. Trager, who had become his close friend. Whorf took a special interest in the Hopi language and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village living in Manhattan, New York. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a short field trip to the village of Mishongnovi, on the Second Mesa of the Hopi Reservation in Arizona.\n\nIn 1936, Whorf was appointed Honorary Research Fellow in Anthropology at Yale, and he was invited by Franz Boas to serve on the committee of the Society of American Linguistics (later Linguistic Society of America). In 1937, Yale awarded him the Sterling Fellowship. He was a lecturer in Anthropology from 1937 through 1938, replacing Sapir, who was gravely ill. Whorf gave graduate level lectures on \"Problems of American Indian Linguistics\". In 1938 with Trager's assistance he elaborated a report on the progress of linguistic research at the department of anthropology at Yale. The report includes some of Whorf's influential contributions to linguistic theory, such as the concept of the allophone and of covert grammatical categories. has argued, that in this report Whorf's linguistic theories exist in a condensed form, and that it was mainly through this report that Whorf exerted influence on the discipline of descriptive linguistics.\n\nIn late 1938, Whorf's own health declined. After an operation for cancer he fell into an unproductive period. He was also deeply influenced by Sapir's death in early 1939. It was in the writings of his last two years that he laid out the research program of Linguistic relativity. His 1939 memorial article for Sapir, \"The Relation of Habitual Thought And Behavior to Language\", in particular has been taken to be Whorf's definitive statement of the issue, and is his most frequently quoted piece.\n\nIn his last year Whorf also published three articles in the \"MIT Technology Review\" titled \"Science and Linguistics\", \"Linguistics as an Exact Science\" and \"Language and Logic\". He was also invited to contribute an article to a theosophical journal, \"Theosophist\", published in Madras, India, for which he wrote \"Language, Mind and Reality\". In these final pieces he offered a critique of Western science in which he suggested that non-European languages often referred to physical phenomena in ways that more directly reflected aspects of reality than many European languages, and that science ought to pay attention to the effects of linguistic categorization in its efforts to describe the physical world. He particularly criticized the Indo-European languages for promoting a mistaken essentialist world view, which had been disproved by advances in the sciences, whereas he suggested that other languages dedicated more attention to processes and dynamics rather than stable essences. Whorf argued that paying attention to how other physical phenomena are described in the study of linguistics could make valuable contributions to science by pointing out the ways in which certain assumptions about reality are implicit in the structure of language itself, and how language guides the attention of speakers towards certain phenomena in the world which risk becoming overemphasized while leaving other phenomena at risk of being overlooked.\n\nAt Whorf's death his friend G. L. Trager was appointed as curator of his unpublished manuscripts. Some of them were published in the years after his death by another of Whorf's friends, Harry Hoijer. In the decade following, Trager and particularly Hoijer did much to popularize Whorf's ideas about linguistic relativity, and it was Hoijer who coined the term \"Sapir-Whorf hypothesis\" at a 1954 conference. Trager then published an article titled \"The systematization of the Whorf hypothesis\", which contributed to the idea that Whorf had proposed a hypothesis that should be the basis for a program of empirical research. Hoijer also published studies of Indigenous languages and cultures of the American South West in which Whorf found correspondences between cultural patterns and linguistic ones. The term, even though technically a misnomer, went on to become the most widely known label for Whorf's ideas. According to John A. Lucy \"Whorf's work in linguistics was and still is recognized as being of superb professional quality by linguists\".\n\nWhorf's work began to fall out of favor less than a decade after his death, and he was subjected to severe criticism from scholars of language, culture and psychology. In 1953 and 1954 psychologists Roger Brown and Eric Lenneberg criticized Whorf for his reliance on anecdotal evidence, formulating a hypothesis to scientifically test his ideas, which they limited to an examination of a causal relation between grammatical or lexical structure and cognition or perception. Whorf himself did not advocate a straight causality between language and thought; instead he wrote that \"Language and culture had grown up together\"; that both were mutually shaped by the other. Hence, has argued that because the aim of the formulation of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was to test simple causation, from the outset it failed to test Whorf's ideas.\n\nFocusing on color terminology, with easily discernible differences between perception and vocabulary, Brown and Lenneberg published in 1954 a study of Zuni color terms that slightly support a weak effect of semantic categorization of color terms on color perception. In doing so they began a line of empirical studies that investigated the principle of linguistic relativity.\n\nEmpirical testing of the Whorfian hypothesis declined in the 1960s to 1980s as Noam Chomsky began to redefine linguistics and much of psychology in formal universalist terms. Several studies from that period refuted Whorf's hypothesis, demonstrating that linguistic diversity is a surface veneer that masks underlying universal cognitive principles. Many studies were highly critical and disparaging in their language, ridiculing Whorf's analyses and examples or his lack of an academic degree. Throughout the 1980s most mentions of Whorf or of the Sapir-Whorf hypotheses continued to be disparaging, and led to a widespread view that Whorf's ideas had been proven wrong. Because Whorf was treated so severely in the scholarship during those decades, he has been described as \"one of the prime whipping boys of introductory texts to linguistics\". In the late 1980s, with the advent of cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics some linguists sought to rehabilitate Whorf's reputation, as scholarship began to question whether earlier critiques of Whorf were justified.\n\nBy the 1960s analytical philosophers also became aware of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and philosophers such as Max Black and Donald Davidson published scathing critiques of Whorf's strong relativist viewpoints. Black characterized Whorf's ideas about metaphysics as demonstrating \"amateurish crudity\". According to Black and Davidson, Whorf's viewpoint and the concept of linguistic relativity meant that translation between languages with different conceptual schemes would be impossible. Recent assessments such as those by Leavitt and Lee, however, consider Black and Davidson's interpretation to be based on an inaccurate characterization of Whorf's viewpoint, and even rather absurd given the time he spent trying to translate between different conceptual schemes. In their view the critiques are based on a lack of familiarity with Whorf's writings; according to these recent Whorf scholars a more accurate description of his viewpoint is that he thought translation to be possible, but only through careful attention to the subtle differences between conceptual schemes.\n\nEric Lenneberg, Noam Chomsky, and Steven Pinker have also criticized Whorf for failing to be sufficiently clear in his formulation of how language influences thought, and for failing to provide real evidence to support his assumptions. Generally Whorf's arguments took the form of examples that were anecdotal or speculative, and functioned as attempts to show how \"exotic\" grammatical traits were connected to what were considered equally exotic worlds of thought. Even Whorf's defenders admitted that his writing style was often convoluted and couched in neologisms – attributed to his awareness of language use, and his reluctance to use terminology that might have pre-existing connotations. argues that Whorf was mesmerized by the foreignness of indigenous languages, and exaggerated and idealized them. According to Lakoff, Whorf's tendency to exoticize data must be judged in the historical context: Whorf and the other Boasians wrote at a time in which racism and jingoism were predominant, and when it was unthinkable to many that \"savages\" had redeeming qualities, or that their languages were comparable in complexity to those of Europe. For this alone Lakoff argues, Whorf can be considered to be \"Not just a pioneer in linguistics, but a pioneer as a human being\".\n\nToday many followers of universalist schools of thought continue to oppose the idea of linguistic relativity, seeing it as unsound or even ridiculous. For example, Steven Pinker argues in his book \"The Language Instinct\" that thought exists prior to language and independently of it, a view also espoused by philosophers of language such as Jerry Fodor, John Locke and Plato. In this interpretation, language is inconsequential to human thought because humans do not think in \"natural\" language, i.e. any language used for communication. Rather, we think in a meta-language that precedes natural language, which Pinker following Fodor calls \"mentalese.\" Pinker attacks what he calls \"Whorf's radical position\", declaring, \"the more you examine Whorf's arguments, the less sense they make.\" Scholars of a more \"relativist\" bent such as John A. Lucy and Stephen C. Levinson have criticized Pinker for misrepresenting Whorf's views and arguing against strawmen.\n\nLinguistic relativity studies have experienced a resurgence since the 1990s, and a series of favorable experimental results have brought Whorfianism back into favor, especially in cultural psychology and linguistic anthropology. The first study directing positive attention towards Whorf's relativist position was George Lakoff's \"Women, Fire and Dangerous Things\", in which he argued that Whorf had been on the right track in his focus on differences in grammatical and lexical categories as a source of differences in conceptualization. In 1992 psychologist John A. Lucy published two books on the topic, one analyzing the intellectual genealogy of the hypothesis, arguing that previous studies had failed to appreciate the subtleties of Whorf's thinking; they had been unable to formulate a research agenda that would actually test Whorf's claims. Lucy proposed a new research design so that the hypothesis of linguistic relativity could be tested empirically, and to avoid the pitfalls of earlier studies which Lucy claimed had tended to presuppose the universality of the categories they were studying. His second book was an empirical study of the relation between grammatical categories and cognition in the Yucatec Maya language of Mexico.\n\nIn 1996 Penny Lee's reappraisal of Whorf's writings was published, reinstating Whorf as a serious and capable thinker. Lee argued that previous explorations of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis had largely ignored Whorf's actual writings, and consequently asked questions very unlike those Whorf had asked. Also in that year a volume, \"Rethinking Linguistic Relativity\" edited by John J. Gumperz and Stephen C. Levinson gathered a range of researchers working in psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology to bring renewed attention to the issue of how Whorf's theories could be updated, and a subsequent review of the new direction of the linguistic relativity paradigm cemented the development. Since then considerable empirical research into linguistic relativity has been carried out, especially at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics with scholarship motivating two edited volumes of linguistic relativity studies, and in American Institutions by scholars such as Lera Boroditsky and Dedre Gentner.\n\nIn turn universalist scholars frequently dismiss as \"dull\" or \"boring\", positive findings of influence of linguistic categories on thought or behavior, which are often subtle rather than spectacular, suggesting that Whorf's excitement about linguistic relativity had promised more spectacular findings than it was able to provide.\n\nWhorf's views have been compared to those of philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and the late Ludwig Wittgenstein, both of whom considered language to have important bearing on thought and reasoning. His hypotheses have also been compared to the views of psychologists such as Lev Vygotsky, whose social constructivism considers the cognitive development of children to be mediated by the social use of language. Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in gestalt psychology, and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin, who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic. Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of positivist science.\n\nWhorf is best known as the main proponent of what he called the principle of linguistic relativity, but which is often known as \"the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis\", named for him and Edward Sapir. Whorf never stated the principle in the form of a hypothesis, and the idea that linguistic categories influence perception and cognition was shared by many other scholars before him. But because Whorf, in his articles, gave specific examples of how he saw the grammatical categories of specific languages related to conceptual and behavioral patterns, he pointed towards an empirical research program that has been taken up by subsequent scholars, and which is often called \"Sapir-Whorf studies\".\n\nWhorf and Sapir both drew explicitly on Albert Einstein's principle of general relativity; hence linguistic relativity refers to the concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing a frame of reference as a medium through which observations are made. Following an original observation by Boas, Sapir demonstrated that speakers of a given language perceive sounds that are acoustically different as the same, if the sound comes from the underlying phoneme and does not contribute to changes in semantic meaning. Furthermore, speakers of languages are attentive to sounds, particularly if the same two sounds come from different phonemes. Such differentiation is an example of how various observational frames of reference leads to different patterns of attention and perception.\n\nWhorf was also influenced by gestalt psychology, believing that languages require their speakers to describe the same events as different gestalt constructions, which he called \"isolates from experience\". An example is how the action of cleaning a gun is different in English and Shawnee: English focuses on the instrumental relation between two objects and the purpose of the action (removing dirt); whereas the Shawnee language focuses on the movement—using an arm to create a dry space in a hole. The event described is the same, but the attention in terms of figure and ground are different.\n\nIf read superficially, some of Whorf's statements lend themselves to the interpretation that he supported linguistic determinism. For example, in an often-quoted passage Whorf writes:\nThe statements about the obligatory nature of the terms of language have been taken to suggest that Whorf meant that language completely determined the scope of possible conceptualizations. However neo-Whorfians argue that here Whorf is writing about the terms in which we speak of the world, not the terms in which we think of it. Whorf noted that to communicate thoughts and experiences with members of a speech community speakers must use the linguistic categories of their shared language, which requires moulding experiences into the shape of language to speak them—a process called \"thinking for speaking\". This interpretation is supported by Whorf's subsequent statement that \"No individual is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality, but is constrained by certain modes of interpretation even when he thinks himself most free\". Similarly the statement that observers are led to different pictures of the universe has been understood as an argument that different conceptualizations are incommensurable making translation between different conceptual and linguistic systems impossible. Neo-Whorfians argue this to be is a misreading since throughout his work one of his main points was that such systems could be \"calibrated\" and thereby be made commensurable, but only when we become aware of the differences in conceptual schemes through linguistic analysis.\n\nWhorf's study of Hopi time has been the most widely discussed and criticized example of linguistic relativity. In his analysis he argues that there is a relation between how the Hopi people conceptualize time, how they speak of temporal relations, and the grammar of the Hopi language. Whorf's most elaborate argument for the existence of linguistic relativity was based on what he saw as a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi. He argued that the Hopi language, in contrast to English and other SAE languages, does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct countable instances, like \"three days\" or \"five years\", but rather as a single process. Because of this difference, the language lacks nouns that refer to units of time. He proposed that the Hopi view of time was fundamental in all aspects of their culture and furthermore explained certain patterns of behavior. In his 1939 memorial essay to Sapir he wrote that “... the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time', or to past, present, or future...”\n\nLinguist Ekkehart Malotki challenged Whorf's analyses of Hopi temporal expressions and concepts with numerous examples how the Hopi language refers to time. Malotki argues that in the Hopi language the system of tenses consists of future and non-future and that the single difference between the three-tense system of European languages and the Hopi system, is that the latter combines past and present to form a single category.\n\nMalotki's critique was widely cited as the final piece of evidence in refuting Whorf's ideas and his concept of linguistic relativity while other scholars defended the analysis of Hopi, arguing that Whorf's claim was not that Hopi lacked words or categories to describe temporality, but that the Hopi concept of time is altogether different from that of English speakers. Whorf described the Hopi categories of tense, noting that time is not divided into past, present and future, as is common in European languages, but rather a single tense refers to both present and past while another refers to events that have not yet happened and may or may not happen in the future. He also described a large array of stems that he called \"tensors\" which describes aspects of temporality, but without referring to countable units of time as in English and most European languages.\n\nWhorf's distinction between \"overt\" (phenotypical) and \"covert\" (cryptotypical) grammatical categories has become widely influential in linguistics and anthropology. British linguist Michael Halliday wrote about Whorf's notion of the \"cryptotype\", and the conception of \"how grammar models reality\", that it would \"eventually turn out to be among the major contributions of twentieth century linguistics\".\n\nFurthermore, Whorf introduced the concept of the allophone, a word that describes positional phonetic variants of a single superordinate phoneme; in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory. The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition. Whorf considered allophones to be another example of linguistic relativity. The principle of allophony describes how acoustically different sounds can be treated as reflections of a single phoneme in a language. This sometimes makes the different sound appear similar to native speakers of the language, even to the point that they are unable to distinguish them auditorily without special training. Whorf wrote that: \"[allophones] are also relativistic. Objectively, acoustically, and physiologically the allophones of [a] phoneme may be extremely unlike, hence the impossibility of determining what is what. You always have to keep the observer in the picture. What linguistic pattern makes like is like, and what it makes unlike is unlike\".(Whorf, 1940)\n\nCentral to Whorf's inquiries was the approach later described as metalinguistics by G. L. Trager, who in 1950 published four of Whorf's essays as \"Four articles on Metalinguistics\". Whorf was crucially interested in the ways in which speakers come to be aware of the language that they use, and become able to describe and analyze language using language itself to do so. Whorf saw that the ability to arrive at progressively more accurate descriptions of the world hinged partly on the ability to construct a metalanguage to describe how language affects experience, and thus to have the ability to calibrate different conceptual schemes. Whorf's endeavors have since been taken up in the development of the study of metalinguistics and metalinguistic awareness, first by Michael Silverstein who published a radical and influential rereading of Whorf in 1979 and subsequently in the field of linguistic anthropology.\n\nWhorf conducted important work on the Uto-Aztecan languages, which Sapir had conclusively demonstrated as a valid language family in 1915. Working first on Nahuatl, Tepecano, Tohono O'odham he established familiarity with the language group before he met Sapir in 1928. During Whorf's time at Yale he published several articles on Uto-Aztecan linguistics, such as \"Notes on the Tübatulabal language\". In 1935 he published \"The Comparative Linguistics of Uto-Aztecan\", and a review of Kroeber's survey of Uto-Aztecan linguistics. Whorf's work served to further cement the foundations of the comparative Uto-Aztecan studies.\n\nThe first Native American language Whorf studied was the Uto-Aztecan language Nahuatl which he studied first from colonial grammars and documents, and later became the subject of his first field work experience in 1930. Based on his studies of Classical Nahuatl Whorf argued that Nahuatl was an oligosynthetic language, a typological category that he invented. In Mexico working with native speakers, he studied the dialects of Milpa Alta and Tepoztlán. His grammar sketch of the Milpa Alta dialect of Nahuatl was not published during his lifetime, but it was published posthumously by Harry Hoijer and became quite influential and used as the basic description of \"Modern Nahuatl\" by many scholars. The description of the dialect is quite condensed and in some places difficult to understand because of Whorf's propensity of inventing his own unique terminology for grammatical concepts, but the work has generally been considered to be technically advanced. He also produced an analysis of the prosody of these dialects which he related to the history of the glottal stop and vowel length in Nahuan languages. This work was prepared for publication by Lyle Campbell and Frances Karttunen in 1993, who also considered it a valuable description of the two endangered dialects, and the only one of its kind to include detailed phonetic analysis of supra-segmental phenomena.\n\nIn Uto-Aztecan linguistics one of Whorf's achievements was to determine the reason the Nahuatl language has the phoneme , not found in the other languages of the family. The existence of in Nahuatl had puzzled previous linguists and caused Sapir to reconstruct a phoneme for proto-Uto-Aztecan based only on evidence from Aztecan. In a 1937 paper published in the journal American Anthropologist, Whorf argued that the phoneme resulted from some of the Nahuan or Aztecan languages having undergone a sound change from the original * to in the position before *. This sound law is known as \"Whorf's law\", considered valid although a more detailed understanding of the precise conditions under which it took place has since been developed.\n\nAlso in 1937, Whorf and his friend G. L. Trager, published a paper in which they elaborated on the Azteco-Tanoan language family, proposed originally by Sapir as a family comprising the Uto-Aztecan and the Kiowa-Tanoan languages—(the Tewa and Kiowa languages).\n\nIn a series of published and unpublished studies in the 1930s, Whorf argued that Mayan writing was to some extent phonetic. While his work on deciphering the Maya script gained some support from Alfred Tozzer at Harvard, the main authority on Ancient Maya culture, J.E.S. Thompson, strongly rejected Whorf's ideas, saying that Mayan writing lacked a phonetic component and is therefore impossible to decipher based on a linguistic analysis. Whorf argued that it was exactly the reluctance to apply linguistic analysis of Maya languages that had held the decipherment back. Whorf sought for cues to phonetic values within the elements of the specific signs, and never realized that the system was logo-syllabic. Although Whorf's approach to understanding the Maya script is now known to have been misguided, his central claim that the script was phonetic and should be deciphered as such was vindicated by Yuri Knorozov's syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.\n\nPublications by Benjamin Lee Whorf\n\nCommentary notes\n\nCitations\n\n"}

His family then moved to England, where he received a scholarship to study piano and composition at the Trinity College of Music in London. Early in life he believed in communism, as a reaction to the Great Depression and to Adolf Hitler, but later he changed his philosophy and worked to combat it.\n\nCrozier eventually became interested in journalism and pursued a career that led him to become a foreign correspondent for Reuters, a columnist for \"The Economist,\" a reporter for the BBC and - during a brief return to Australia - a writer for \"The Sydney Morning Herald\".\n\nCrozier worked as the director of \"Forum World Features\", set up in 1966 by the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which had ties to the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). While editing the \"Economist\"'s \"insider\" news-sheet \"Foreign Report\", Crozier, as he later recorded in his memoirs, kept some of the best stories that reached him for the CIA. He stated in 1975 that \"Forum World Features\" had broken all ties to the CIA when he became its director in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1970, Crozier founded the Institute for the Study of Conflict, based in London, to study insurgencies and terrorism. He presided over it for most of the 1970s. According to a profile written by David Rees in 1985 for the American fortnightly \"National Review\" \"the Institute...was the first private think-tank devoted to the study of terrorism and subversion\". Under his direction (he left in 1979) the institute specialised in the study of the \"peace-time\" strategy of the Soviet Union. Its analyses, including the \"Annual of Power and Conflict\" which it published for ten years, have been used in war colleges throughout the West. \n\nFor many years Crozier wrote a regular column, \"The Protracted Conflict\", in the \"National Review\". Joseph D'Agostino of \"Human Events\" states: \"Crozier has another distinction: in 1988 he appeared in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for having interviewed the most heads of state or government, 58 in all.\"\n\nCrozier provided advice to the British Secret Intelligence Service, to the Information Research Department (IRD) of the British Foreign Office, and to the CIA. Lecturing to Britain's staff college for army officers during the early 1970s, when the Labour Party was in power under Harold Wilson, Crozier stated if the government went \"too far\", it was the armed forces' duty to intervene (he claimed that he was enthusiastically applauded). In 1982 it was revealed from the papers of former Bavarian state security chief Hans Langemann that Crozier was an attendant of Le Cercle and headed a secret international group that tried to influence the West German federal election of 1980 by using secret-service connections and cover-up financial transactions to make Franz Josef Strauß Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. \n\nHarperCollins published Crozier's autobiography, \"Free Agent: The Unseen War 1941–1991\", in 1993, revised and corrected in paperback edition in 1994.\n\nCrozier was a Distinguished Visiting Fellow on War, Revolution, and Peace of the Hoover Institution. He was also a member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. In 1985, he signed a petition in support for the far-right paramilitary Contras (Nicaragua).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "72735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72735", "title": "Cusco", "text": "Cusco\n\nCusco (, ; , ), often spelled Cuzco (), is a city in southeastern Peru, near the Urubamba Valley of the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the Cusco Region and of the Cusco Province. In 2013, the city had a population of 435,114. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cuzco, its elevation is around .\n\nThe site was the historic capital of the Inca Empire from the 13th until the 16th-century Spanish conquest. In 1983 Cusco was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting nearly 2 million visitors a year. The Constitution of Peru designates it as the Historical Capital of Peru.\n\nThe indigenous name of this city is \"Qusqu\". Although the name was used in Quechua, its origin is found in the Aymara language. The word is derived from the phrase \"qusqu wanka\" ('Rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar Siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (\"Ayar Auca\") acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his \"ayllu\" (\"lineage\"):\n\nThe Spanish conquistadors adopted the local name, transliterating it into Spanish phonetics as \"Cuzco\" or, less often, \"Cozco\". \"Cuzco\" was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\nthough \"Cusco\" was also used. \"Cuzco\", pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time. As both Spanish and Quechuan pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer close to the Quechuan pronunciation of the consonant represented by 'z' in \"Cuzco\". In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new one, \"Cusco\", in municipality publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling related more closely to Quechan: \"Qosqo\".\n\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\" and \"z\" can be found. However, the \"Oxford Dictionary of English\" recognizes \"Cuzco\" but not \"Cusco\"; the \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary\" has \"Cuzco\", with \"Cusco\" only as a \"variant\"; and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is employed more often than \"Cusco\". The city's international airport code is still CUZ, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\nThe Killke people occupied the region from 900 to 1200, prior to the arrival of the Inca in the 13th century. Carbon-14 dating of Saksaywaman, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, archaeologists discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and aqueduct system at Saksaywaman. The temple covers some and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies, establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the Inca Empire (13th century–1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an effigy in the shape of a puma, a sacred animal. How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the \"urin\" and \"hanan\". Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\n\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of Pachacuti, when an Inca died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (split inheritance). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire, in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\n\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by Sapa Inca Pachacuti, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of \"Tawantinsuyu\". Archaeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archaeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\n\nThe city fell to the sphere of Huáscar during the Inca Civil War after the death of Huayna Capac in 1527. It was captured by the generals of Atahualpa in April 1532 in the Battle of Quipaipan. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city (see battle of Cuzco) and gained control because of their arms and horses, employing superior military technology.\n\nThe first three Spaniards arrived in the city in May 1533, after the Battle of Cajamarca, collecting for Atahualpa's Ransom Room. On 15 November 1533 Francisco Pizarro officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas...astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three parapets and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock.\" \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river...faced with stone.\" \"The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco...was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun...studded with gold plates...surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests.\" \"The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the Coricancha.\n\nPizarro ceremoniously gave Manco Inca the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader. Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out repartimientos to do so. Alcaldes were established and regidores on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and then departed for Jauja with Manco Inca.\n\nPizarro renamed it the \"Very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence with Inca indigenous architecture, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city.\n\nFather Vincente de Valverde became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the plaza. He placed a St. Dominic monastery on the ruins of the House of the Sun and a nunnery where the House of the Virgins of the Sun was stood.\n\nThe city was retaken from the Spanish during the Siege of Cuzco of 1536 by Manco Inca Yupanqui, a leader of the Sapa Inca. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to Vilcabamba, the capital of the newly established small Neo-Inca State, which lasted for another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, many Incas died of smallpox.\n\nCusco stands on layers of cultures, with the Tawantinsuyu (old Inca Empire) built on Killke structures and the Spanish replacing indigenous temples with Catholic churches and palaces with mansions for the invaders.\n\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the Andean world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with Spain. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and convents, as well as a cathedral, university and Archbishopric.\n\nAfter Peru declared its independence in 1821, Cusco maintained its importance within Peru's administrative structure. Upon independence, the government created the Department of Cuzco, maintaining authority over territory extending to the Brazilian border. Cusco was made capital of the department; subsequently it became the most important city in the south-eastern Andean region.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the city's urban sprawl spread to the neighboring districts of Santiago and Wanchaq.\n\nIn 1911, explorer Hiram Bingham used the city as a base for the expedition in which he rediscovered the ruins of Machu Picchu.\n\nA major earthquake on 21 May 1950 caused the destruction of more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive \"Qurikancha\" (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the granite retaining walls of the \"Qurikancha\" were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage. Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.\n\nSince the 1990s, tourism has increased. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada Pérez, a staunch supporter of the \"Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua\", between 1983 and 1995 the Quechua name \"Qosqo\" was officially adopted for the city.\n\n\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco, its elevation is around . To its north is the Vilcabamba mountain range with mountains. The highest peak is Salcantay () about northwest of Cusco.\n\nCusco has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen \"Cwb\"). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. The dry season lasts from May to August, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coolest month with an average of . The wet season lasts from December to March, with night frost less common; November averages . Although frost and hail are common, the only snowfall ever recorded was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from , but the all-time temperature range is between . Sunshine hours peak in July; the equivalent of January in the northern hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the northern hemisphere, has the least amount of sunshine.\n\nCusco was found in 2006 to be the spot on Earth with the highest average ultraviolet light level.\n\nTourism has been the backbone to the economy starting in the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year. In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was $837 million USD. In 2009, that number increased to $2.47 billion USD.\n\nThe indigenous Killke culture built the walled complex of Sacsayhuamán about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an aqueduct (Pukyus) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Saksaywaman was expanded by the Inca.\nThe Spanish explorer Pizarro sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, Qurikancha (the Temple of the Sun) and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger than the foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the Cathedral of Santo Domingo, Cusco.\n\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, Machu Picchu, which can be reached on foot by the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or by train; and the \"fortress\" at Ollantaytambo.\n\nLess-visited ruins include: Incahuasi, the highest of all Inca sites at ; Vilcabamba, the capital of the Inca after the capture of Cusco; the sculpture garden at Ñusta Hisp'ana (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); Tipón with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as Willkaraqay, Patallaqta, Chuqik'iraw, Moray, Vitos and many others.\n\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including corn, barley, quinoa, tea and coffee.\n\nCusco's main stadium Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the Copa América, in 2004. The stadium is home to one of the country's most successful soccer clubs, \"Cienciano\".\n\nThe city is served by Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport.\n\nBecause of its antiquity and importance, the city center retains many buildings, plazas, streets and churches from colonial times, and even some pre-Columbian structures, which led to its declaration as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. Among the main sights of the city are:\n\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\n\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is \"Tuq'ukachi\", which means the opening of the salt.\n\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street \"Hatun Rumiyoq\" (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of Inca Roca, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\n\nAlong this street that runs from the \"Plaza de Armas\" to the \"Barrio de San Blas\", one can see the Stone of Twelve Angles, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\n\nIts cloisters of Baroque Renaissance style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\n\nAlso on view is an elaborate monstrance made of gold and gemstones that weighs and is in height.\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the \"Iglesia del Triunfo\", built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of Viracocha Inca. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the Cathedral.\n\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\n\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\n\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"Cuzco School\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the Last Supper depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\n\nThe cathedral is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cuzco.\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by Francisco Pizarro in the conquest of Cuzco.\n\nSimilarly, the Plaza de Armas was the scene of the death of Túpac Amaru II, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\n\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compañía both open directly onto the plaza.\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the Jesuits in 1576 on the foundations of the \"Amarucancha\" or the palace of the Inca ruler Wayna Qhapaq, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\nIts façade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\n\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (Inti) at the time of the Inca Empire. According to ancient chronicles written by Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler), Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God – Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.\n\nThe temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\n\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the Convent of Santo Domingo (St. Dominic) in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the Cuzco School.\n\nCusco has the following important museums:\n\n\nThere are also some museums located at churches.\n\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to INEI.\n\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people. Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n\n\nCusco is twinned with:\n\n\n\n"}

Bashkin adds that \"Sheehi's selection of texts is unique and original. Instead of focusing on either works in social thought or narrative prose, the book studies a variety of texts - pamphlets, newspaper articles, and philosophical tracts as well as maqamat, novels, and sketches - in an attempt to explicate new conversations and ideas, which were articulated in different genres and linguistic modes.\" \n\nAmong the first of a wave of scholars to apply post-colonial and post-structural theory, most notably the theory of Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, and Homi Bhabha, to modern Arab culture and Arabic literature, the book discusses major Arab intellectuals of the 19th century including Butrus al-Bustani, Salim al-Bustani, Jurji Zaydan, Farah Antun, Ahmad Faris Shidyaq, Nasif al-Yaziji, Muhammad al-Muwaylihi, Muhammad Abduh and others including Jamal ad-din al-Afghani. Anthropologist Lucia Volk writes that Sheehi proves that these intellectual \"elites actively produced indigenous ideologies of modernity while struggling against the overwhelming powers of Western colonialism.\"\n\nReframing the conception of modern Arab identity from a confrontation between two undifferentiated cultures, the book closely reads \"foundational\" Arabic texts from turn of the century\nto demonstrate that the ideology and discourses of Arab subjectivity were internally formed within the Ottoman Empire at a time of radical transformations in governance and political economy. Sheehi locates the battle for \"self\" and \"other\" outside of the \"colonial encounter\" between Western colonizer and Eastern colonized. Instead, the dialectic between Self and Other\ntranspired internally—epistemologically and discursively—on a plane of dynamic cultural and social formations within Ottoman Arab society and polity during the Tanzimat. Sheehi proposes that the concept of cultural \"failure\" is inherent to the ways modern Arab intellectuals critically reorganized and redefined Arab subjectivity during modernity. Examining a host of varying sources including Arab fiction and commentary from the Arab Press, Sheehi maps out a \"formula\" for Arab reform during 19th and 20th century al-nahda, which predicates \"progress and civilization\" as \"proleptic\" teleological endpoints. Linguistically and semiotically structuring this formula was an axiomatic \"nomenclature of reform\" that was found in all Arab reform writing and thought despite the ideological, sectarian, political, or national position of the author. This commonality, Sheehi reveals, is due to that historical and political fact that all reform paradigms during the late Ottoman and Mandate periods arose from a fundamental epistemology of Arab modernity; a hybridized but still thorough modern form of modernity that Sheehi states was \"autogenetic.\"\n\nAs this epistemology is based on priorities of indigenous and colonialist capitalist development and Western political hegemony, recast in the form of liberalism and Western cultural and superiority, intellectual paradigms, political programs, and visions of new national social order among Arab thinkers inevitably always express \"lack\" as the core of Arab identity because it is engaged in an endless struggle of authority and \"subjective presence\" with the West, who otherwise accuses Arabs as being inherently \"backwards\". This condition of failure is written into Arab subjectivity by Arabs themselves, internalizing racist notions of Arab otherness that accompany the \"modern\", humanist, Enlightenment project. Hence, what is self-diagnosed as \"the inherent failure of Arab culture and \"identity\" is not proof of the inability of the Arab world to enter into modernity but in fact is precisely a condition of it. Hence, \"Foundations of Modern Arab Identity\" reveals that a \"spectral European presence\" is ever present in Arab modernity and its paradigms of Arab identity.\n\n\n"}

Through the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Stalin believed he could bring about a change in the European balance of power. When he learnt through his intelligence of Hitler's aggressive intentions, in late 1930s, the dismal state of the military, decapitated through the purges of the 1930s, he had no choice but to resort to appeasement hoping he could either delay the war or reach a second agreement with Hitler.

It is one of the most cited papers in the history of the \"AHR\". In 2008, the \"AHR\" focused its December issue on the paper, featuring six articles on the paper, including one by Scott herself. At that time, \"Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis\" was the most-visited \"AHR\" article on JSTOR, having been accessed more than 38,000 times since 1997 – more than 16,000 more views than the next most popular of that journal's articles.\n\nThe paper begins by discussing three existing theoretical approaches to gender. Scott then provides her own definition of gender in two parts: gender is based on the perceived differences between the sexes, but is also a way of signifying power differentials. This second part of the definition is, according to William Sewell, \"important and contentious\", making a claim for the importance of gender in all areas of history. The paper argues that the field of gender history should focus on social and political construction of gender. It is, according to Dyan Elliott, a manifesto for the use of gender as a way of looking at the history of \"male institutions\". The paper was influenced by the French philosophers Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, and Scott was influenced by the linguistic turn in history.\n\nMany of the initial reactions to Scott's paper were highly negative. She has said that when she first presented it at a seminar in 1985, the audience \"were, to a man, appalled\". Joanne Meyerowitz comments that an early critic accused Scott's paper of \"nihilism, presentism, ahistoricism, obfuscation, elitism, obeisance to patriarchy, ethnocentrism, irrelevance, and possibly racism\". Other critics were more positive. Linda Kerber called the paper \"dazzling\", while William Sewell called it an \"instant classic\".\n\nScott's 1986 paper had a significantly longer-term impact than most. It was reprinted in 1988 as part of \"Gender and the Politics of History\", a collection of Scott's essays on gender history, which was reissued in 1999 in a revised edition. Scott herself has published two papers responding to it: \"Unanswered Questions\" in 2008 and \"Gender: Still a Useful Category of Analysis?\" in 2010. Its impact is strong even outside of the English-speaking world; Lola Sanchez called the Spanish translation of the paper \"one of the most important texts of the past twenty-five years\" for feminist scholars in Spain.\n\nIn 2008, Joanne Meyerowitz wrote that it had \"no discernible date of expiration\". By that time, it was required reading for \"dozens of syllabi\"; it was described as \"canonical\" by the American Historical Review; and it was the most-accessed article in the history of the American Historical Review on JSTOR. Meyerowitz credits the paper with a \"significant part in the broader shift from social to cultural history\".\n\n"}

Anatomically modern humans (AMH, or AMHS) developed within the species \"Homo sapiens\" about 200,000 years ago. \n\nMany thinkers have attempted to explain hominization - from Classical times through Hobbes, Rousseau, Hegel, and Engels, who wrote an essay on \"The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man\". The contemporary study of hominization in archeology often looks for signs that mark out human habitations from pre-human forms: for example, the use of grave goods.\n\nIn ancient philosophy, \"hominization\" referred to the ensoulment of the human fetus. When the soul is said to enter the fetus at some time later than conception, this is sometimes called \"delayed hominization\", as in the Aristotelian belief in ensoulment 40 days after conception.\n\nIn the context of modern theistic evolution, \"hominization\" refers to the theory that there was a point at which a population of hominids who had (or may have) evolved by a process of evolution acquired souls and thus (with their descendants) became fully human in theological terms. This group might be restricted to Adam and Eve, or indeed to Mitochondrial Eve, although versions of the theory allow for larger populations. The point at which this occurred should essentially be the same as in paleoanthropology and archeology, but theological discussion of the matter tends to concentrate on the theoretical. The term \"special transformism\" refers to theories of a divine intervention of some sort, achieving hominization. \n\nThe process and means by which hominization occurs is a key problem in theistic evolutionary thought, at least for the Abrahamic religions, for which the belief that animals do not have souls but humans do is a core teaching. Scientific accounts of the origin of the universe, origin of life and subsequent evolution of pre-human life forms may not cause any difficulty (helped by the reluctance of science itself to say anything about what preceded the Big Bang) but the need to reconcile religious and scientific views of hominization and account for the addition of a soul to humans remains a problem. Several 19th-century theologians attempted specific solutions, including the Catholics John Augustine Zahm and St. George Jackson Mivart, but tended to come under attack from both the theological and biological camps. 20th-century thinking has tended to avoid proposing precise mechanisms.\n\nThis term is used to describe the tendency to attribute \"human\" characteristics to entities that are other than human. Example; \"My dog's separation anxiety\", etc.\n\n\n"}

He described the history of that city in a large work, known only through the Excerpta of Photius (I of Constantinople), and describing especially the various tyrants who had at times ruled Heraclea.\n\nMemnon's history encompassed an unknown number of books, but Photius had read the ninth through the sixteenth, and made a tolerably copious abstract of that portion. The first eight books he had not read, and he speaks of other books after the sixteenth. The ninth book begins with an account of the tyrant Clearchus, the disciple of Plato and Isocrates. The thirteenth book contains a long account of the rise of Rome. The last event mentioned in the sixteenth book was the death of Brithagoras, who was sent by the Heracleians as ambassador to Julius Caesar, after the latter had obtained the supreme power (48 BC). \n\nFrom this Gerardus Vossius supposes that the work was written about the time of Caesar Augustus at the beginning of the 1st century AD; in the judgment of Orelli, not later than the time of Hadrian or the Antonines, in the middle of the 2nd century; the \"Oxford Classical Dictionary\" thinks the 2nd century AD likely. It is, of course, impossible to fix the date with any precision, as we do not know at all down to what time the entire work was carried. The style of Memnon, according to Photius, was clear and simple, and the words well chosen. The Excerpta of Photius, however, contain numerous examples of rare and poetical expressions, as well as a few which indicate the decline of the Greek language. These Excerpta of Photius were first published separately, together with the remains of Ctesias and Agatharchides by Henry Estienne, Paris, 1557. The best edition is that by Johann Conrad Orelli, Leipzig, 1816, containing, together with the remains of Memnon, a few fragments of other writers on Heraclea.\n\nMemnon's history is valuable as a continuous account of nearly all the Hellenistic period, albeit a compressed one from a local vantage point. It is also valuable as the only reasonably complete example of the Greek historical genre of local history.\n\n\n\n"}

The text records that in the tenth year of Mursili's reign, \"the Sun gave a sign\" (\"\"), just as the king was about to launch a campaign against the Kingdom of Azzi-Hayasa in north-eastern Anatolia.\n\nThe reference in the annals was first interpreted as describing an eclipse by Emil Forrer (1926), Schorr (1928) identified it as the eclipse the of 13 March 1335 BC, visible as annular in Anatolia in the afternoon.\nIt is now more commonly identified as the one of 24 June 1312, which was visible in totality in northern Anatolia in the afternoon. Paul Åström (1993) proposes the alternative date of 13 April 1308, which would have been visible as partial eclipse at sunrise. Peter J. Huber has suggested a date of 8 January 1339 BC.\n\nThe 1312 eclipse occurred over northern Anatolia in the early afternoon, and its effects would have been quite spectacular for Mursili and his men on campaign:\n\nAreas that were inside the maximum eclipse included the islands that are now Barlavento in Cape Verde, the Moorish lands (comprising modern day Mauritania, Western Sahara, Morocco and Algeria), Tunisia (then inner Africa), Greece, the Caucasus region, Persia (now Iran), in the area of the present-day Iranian-Turkmeni border, present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan and a part of the north of India.\n\nThe eclipse started off in modern-day Brazil in South America and finished in what is now Myanmar (also known as Burma).\n\nThe 1312 date would imply that Mursili began his reign in either 1322 or 1321 BC. This date would be roughly that usually proposed for the death of Tutankhamun. It is known that Suppiluliuma I was besieging Carchemish when he received a letter from the widow of a Pharaoh (who is called Dakhamunzu in the annals). Suppiluliuma died shortly thereafter and his successor was Mursili II (whose brother would have been Prince Zannanza sent to Egypt where he died). Thus this appears to be a chronological anchor. However, there are other views, asserting for example that the dead Pharaoh was Akhenaten or that Tutankhamun died later.\n\nIn contrast, the 1308 eclipse was annular, and began very early in the morning over Arabia (and only penumbral over Anatolia and Syria), reaching its height over Central Asia:\n\nOther areas that had inside the band of the annular eclipse included the Indus Delta and parts of Siberia including the New Siberian Islands. The maximum eclipse ended at sunset over the Beaufort Sea along with the Bering Sea and the westernmost portion of Alaska with the west of the Aleutian Islands. The eclipse covered much of Asia except for the southwesternmost portions and the southeastern islands, one of the islands that was near the edge of the eclipse was Honshū, Japan.\n\n\n\n"}

Rasmussen (1928—2003), later director of IBM's Cambridge Scientific Center, and an important contributor to the development of time-sharing operating systems, and Laura Sootin Rasmussen (1933—), later an organiser and officer of the National Organization for Women in New England – he attended the Roxbury Latin School, near Boston, in Massachusetts.\n\nHaving worked in biology research labs since his early teens, Rasmussen's undergraduate exposure to art history and theory spurred an interest in history and philosophy of science; and, as a consequence, he enrolled in a PhD program in Philosophy at the University of Chicago to pursue this field. He worked there with William Wimsatt for two years; and, after taking a master's degree, he went on to Cambridge University to study history of biology with Nick Jardine in the M.Phil. program in History and Philosophy of Science.\n\nThen, in 1987 he took up a PhD scholarship in Biological Sciences at Stanford University; and, while pursuing doctoral research in plant developmental biology under Paul B. Green, he also continued working in history of science with Tim Lenoir.\n\nIn 2007, to allow him to become more involved in health policy scholarship, he took a master's degree in Public Health at University of Sydney Medical School.\n\nAfter postdoctoral training in history of science at Stanford and Harvard – and short term teaching positions in the field at Princeton and UCLA – he moved to a teaching position in history and philosophy of science at Sydney University (1994—1997) and, then, to the University of New South Wales in Sydney, where he is now a Professor.\n\nHis research has dealt with the role of instrumentation in shaping scientific knowledge; the history of biotechnology, molecular biology and its cultural and intellectual history; the history of drug abuse and pharmaceuticals in the United States since 1900; and the influence of industry sponsorship on biomedical research.\n\nHe is best known for his focus on the ways in which experimental methods and technology can shape research disciplines, sociologically and intellectually, and on the related role of patronage in shaping scientific fields in the mid-20th century USA. He has been principal investigator on several National Science Foundation (US) and Australian Research Council grants.\n\nHis first book, \"Picture Control: The Electron Microscope and the Transformation of Biology in America, 1940–1960 (1998)\", won both the \"\", and the \"Forum for the History of Science in America's Book Prize for 2000\".\n\nHis second book, \"On Speed: The Many Lives of Amphetamine (2008)\", is a widely cited history of the amphetamines in medicine and American culture.\n\nHis third book, \"Gene Jockeys: Life Science and the Rise of Biotech Enterprise (2014)\", was shortlisted in the \"basis of medicine category\" of the 2015 British Medical Association's Medical Book Awards, and was highly commended by the judging panel.\n\n"}

Ōhinetahi valley is situated at the head of Lyttelton Harbour while the Port Hills rise above Ōhinetahi. \nWhile the Ōhinetahi Homestead is considered to be a significant historic building in the small settlement of Governors Bay, the formal garden of Ōhinetahi is considered to be one of New Zealand's finest. Amongst the early owners of Ōhinetahi were Canterbury pioneer William Sefton Moorhouse and Thomas Potts, New Zealand's first conservationist. Sir Miles Warren, architect of the Christchurch Town Hall, was the last private owner, and gifted it to New Zealand.\n\nThe place was once a heavily fortified Ngāti Māmoe pā. Approximately 300 years ago, it was overtaken by Te Rakiwhakaputa of Ngāi Tahu. After the pā's capture, Manuhiri, son of Te Rakiwhakaputa, resided here, fathering many sons and one daughter after whom the pā is named.\n\nThe first European owner of the land was Christopher Alderson Calvert (1811–1883), a lawyer practicing in Lyttelton and Christchurch who purchased the land in 1852.\nHe had a one-room cottage designed by Benjamin J. Mountfort and built in Lyttelton before it was transported in sections by boat and carried up to the site.\nHe named the cottage \"Rosemary Cottage\" after one of Bishop Selwyn's daughters. On consulting local Maori about a name for the property, they suggested and he was delighted to adopt the name, Ohinetahi.\nFour subsequent owners followed in a short period of time before William Sefton Moorhouse purchased the property in the mid-1850s. Moorhouse then built a more substantial building either by adding rooms onto each end of the existing cottage or more likely by replacing it with an entirely new house.\nMoorhouse sold the entire 255-acre property to Thomas Potts in 1858. Potts proceeded to buy more of the surrounding land until the property covered 572 acres, reaching as far as the seashore at Governors Bay, along the main road as well as Quail island. Between 1863 and 1867 Potts pulled the existing house apart and built a three-story sandstone structure between the two wooden halves.\n\nPotts, one of New Zealand's earliest conservationists, established in 1865 a large garden on the property which as well as a vegetable garden and orchard included trees such as araucarias, ashes, blue gums, Lombardy poplars, New World conifers, oaks, sycamores and walnuts. The variety of exotic trees and shrubs that Potts selected were on the advice of a friend at Kew Garden. Pott's four hectare garden included a quince and variegated elm that still survive. After his death in 1888, the garden was left untended until it was mostly just a lawn around the house. \n\nThe 572-acre property was then sold in 1896 to William Cook, who sold off several acres and the property was once again subdivided when Cook died with a Mr Beckett and a Mr Stewart buying the property which contained the house. They, in turn, sold off parts until in 1946 the house and the surrounding 9 acres was purchased by Basil Quaife. Quaife subsequently sold this property in 1952 to Herbert Ensor.\n\nDeciding in the mid-1970s that they would like to create a large garden together John and Pauline Trengrove and Pauline's brother Miles Warren began looking for a suitable site. After a number of setbacks, Miles Warren heard that Ohinetahi was for sale by its current owners Mr and Mrs Herbert Ensor, who would be remaining on an adjacent property. They subsequently bought it for $100,000, financing the purchase by selling other properties. During the period between purchase and possession, the three new owners embarked on a six-week tour of gardens in England in a search for ideas to include in their proposed garden. Among the gardens visited were Sissinghurst, Wilton House and Hidcote Manor. \nFirst they restored the large stone colonial villa. Work commenced on creating the present garden in 1977. \n\nAfter about ten years John and Pauline decided to build a new house and create a garden on 10 acres of land at Ohoka. To fund their new project Warren purchased their share of the property to become Ohinetahi's sole owner.\n\nIn subsequent years two small art galleries, as well as a cottage for the housekeeper, were constructed on the property. One gallery contains works by prominent New Zealand artists including Shane Cotton, Julian Dashper, Pat Hanly, Ralph Hotere, Richard McWhannell and Peter Robinson. The other gallery contains 3D models and architectural photographs building projects undertaken by the architectural firm of Warren & Mahoney.\n\nThe main house was badly damaged by the 4 September 2010 Christchurch earthquake The stone walls of the three storey block were badly cracked and the four gables fell. As a result, it was decided to reduce the central block of the house from three to two stories, while at the same time the house was earthquake strengthened and given a strengthened masonry ground floor and a new timber-framed first floor. While the structure of the art gallery was undamaged the Oamaru stone exterior was badly cracked and had to be rebuilt, only to then be damaged again by the February 2011 earthquake.\n\nAfter Mrs Esnor died in 2008 Warren was able to purchase from her heirs a 0.76-hectare strip of land which allowed Ohinetahi to be expanded towards the harbour side. Terraces were constructed on this land using stone removed from the upper storey of the house when it was restored after the earthquake.\n\nIn recent times a number of large modern sculptures by renowned New Zealand artists have been installed in both the park and garden.\n\nThe housekeeper's cottage has been converted to a tearoom.\n\nIn 2012 Miles Warren gifted the homestead and gardens as well as an endowment to the Ohinetahi Charitable Trust to ensure that the property and its contents are preserved for the benefit of the public.\nIn early February 2017 a major fire on the Ports Hills which required the excavation of 107 local residents came within 300 to 400 metres of the house coating the property with falling ash.\n\nThe woodland that surrounds the home is well structured and designed with views down to the harbour. Ōhinetahi uses the concept of \"rooms\" to create effect. The terraced garden is sectioned into groupings. Hedges shelter those plants that have difficulty in high winds. The garden is characterised by a herb potager, box-edged rose garden, and herbaceous borders. Other features of the English-inspired landscaping include a Red Garden (formerly white), ogee gazebo, pond, bridge, statues, stone and metal sculpture, and an Oamaru stonewall. The central lawn fronts the house's main façade, which has arched colonial verandas. A stream flows from the garden down to the harbour.\n\nFlora include Black Locust shade trees, a hedge of Monterey Cypress, as well as densely planted rhododendrons, camellias, and \"Buxus\". Though Potts introduced grasses, he found the Poa to be hard to eradicate.\n\nOhinetahi has received the Garden of Distinction and Garden of Excellence Award. The homestead is registered as a Category I heritage building with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.\n\n"}

It has since grown to become one of the world’s leading archival libraries on subjects such as the Second Spanish Republic, the Spanish Civil War, exile, the Franco regime and Spain’s transition to democracy. In addition, the library has important materials on the Soviet Bloc and on the international political history of the twentieth history, particularly the World War II.\n\nIn 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, the government of the Republic participated in the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la vie moderne, popularly known as the Paris International Exhibition of 1937. The civil war in Spain was experiencing a change in project conception, incialment even more excitement to the technical developments in different countries, and the Spanish Pavilion becomes an evidence of the tragic political situation country: \"the character that owes tener the spanish Section of the Exhibition (...) can and should be accounted the present moment and the wonderful village esfuerzo spanish defender for its independence and the cause of peace in the world.\"\n\nThe exhibition lasted from 25 May until 25 November 1937. The Pavilion was opened but not until July 12. Was located at Avenida del Trocadero near the pavilions of Germany and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe project architect was the philosopher Jose Gaos, curator of the flag, the painter Josep Renau and writer Max Aub who organized the contents of the exhibition pavilion and commissioned the construction of the building to Josep Maria Sert and Luis Lacasa.\n\nAudiovisual production was by Luis Buñuel, appointed coordinator of the Propaganda the Information Service at the Embassy in Paris.\n\nThe building of the Pavilion of the Republic, was conceived by its architect Josep Lluis Sert and Luis Lacasa as an empty container, almost three floors and walls. He left the floor open courtyard that communicated with, covered with a tarp, was the role of audience.\n\nOn the first floor, devoted to propaganda and information on the situation of the country at war, it was accessed by a stairway and the second aimed at the arts and popular sections, where the large mural by Joan Miró , the Catalan peasant (now disappeared), it was accessed by a ramp, although there was a vertical access to the interior of the structure.\n\nIt was built with a limitation of time and materials, many prefabricated panels and plywood, or synthetic, and adapting the plan to build an irregular terrain, slope and with the obligation to respect the trees in allocated land. It had an area of 1,400 square meters.\n\nIt took a sober building that followed the lines of rational architecture despite its ephemeral nature. So basically acquired a cultural and propaganda to let the world know the situation unfolding in Spain, precisely define the objectives of government and emphasized the heroic struggle of the Spanish people.\n\nInside (front and acting as a gigantic panel exhibitor), they exhibited posters, photographs, photomontages, proclamations, information panels, as well as art and craft, sent directly from Spanish central and regional governments and various unions. Much of the exhibits sought to proclaim to the public the situation was before and after the Spanish Republic, and the war situation.\n\nOne of its main attractions was the famous Guernica by Pablo Picasso, located in one wall of the central courtyard where the Mercury Fountain, made by Alexander Calder.\n\nWith the Olympic Games of 1992, the City Council commended the architects Antonio Ubach, Juan Miguel Hernandez and Miguel Espinet Leon carrying a replica of the Pavilion of the Republic that had been presented at the International Exhibition of Paris of 1937 and was destroyed in the end.\n\nToday, this landmark building, given since 1994, the City Council at the University of Barcelona, is occupied by CRAI Library Hall of the Republic, which has one of the most important collection in the world on Second Republic Civil War, Francoism, Transition and exile in Spain, especially in Catalonia and the International Centre for Historical Studies, founded by Jaume Vicens Vives.\n\nA reproduction of Picasso's famous Guernica can be seen, as was its original location, on a wall of the open courtyard of the pavilion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5218231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5218231", "title": "Professional wrestling in Australia", "text": "Professional wrestling in Australia\n\nProfessional wrestling in Australia makes up a small part of Australian culture. Unlike the North American or Japanese products which have large, globally renowned organisations such as World Wrestling Entertainment, New Japan Pro Wrestling or Impact Wrestling with several hundred smaller promotions, Australia only has approximately 30 smaller independent circuit promotions which exist in all but one of the states and territories, that being the Northern Territory. Tours from the North American product are regularly sold out in capital cities such as Melbourne, Sydney, Perth and Brisbane.\n\nProfessional wrestling in Australia first gained distinction in the early 1900s, however there were very few shows promoted. Nonetheless, stars such as Clarence Weber, Jack Carkeek, Clarence Whistler and Georg Hackenschmidt toured the country. As time went on, the sport's popularity began to grow, particularly in the 1930s as people sought to find relief from The Great Depression.\n\nThroughout the 1940s professional wrestling suffered due to World War II but in the 1950s it reached new highs as many stars from overseas were imported and created larger crowds and, in turn, a larger market. Established names such as Lou Thesz, Dr. Jerry Graham and Gorgeous George toured the country during the decade.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Australia established its only major promotion in WCW Australia. WCW had a television deal with the Nine Network, the first in Australia to do so and attracted crowds between 2,000 and 9,000 people on a weekly basis. International stars such as Killer Kowalski, Ray Stevens, Dominic Denucci, Mario Milano, Spiros Arion, Karl Gotch, Bruno Sammartino, Gorilla Monsoon and local stars Ron Miller and Larry O'Dea were all involved with the promotion which grew steadily through the 1960s and was a well known product in the 1970s. However, with the introduction of World Series Cricket, WCW was left with no television deal and was forced to close down in 1978. This sent the Australian market into a large decline. With no access to any product anywhere in the world, the Australian market was almost dead until the World Wrestling Federation became a prominent figure in professional wrestling in the mid-1980s.\n\nAustralia has depended on the North American product since 1985. Hosting tours in 1985 and 1986 kept a solid viewing in the sport through programmes such as \"Superstars of Wrestling\" and \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". Small local promotions have tried to take advantage of the popularity of professional wrestling in more recent times, but there has been nothing of note since the demise of World Championship Wrestling in 1978.\n\nHowever the local scene has been the subject of controversy.\n\nIn September 2002, a promotion called PCW presented a show called \"Carnage\", in which two wrestlers faced off in the first-ever barbed-wire match in Australia. The event was billed as a \"Great Family Night Out\", however before the bout an announcer warned parents to take their children from the Rowville arena if they were upset by blood.\n\nThe match saw real blood, fake glass and one contestant setting fire to a chair. The ring ropes were replaced with barbed wire and a bucket of thumb tacks was dumped on the ring floor. Much of the controversy surrounded rumours about the event, suggesting that the outpour of blood was so intense that it 'splattered' onto members of the crowd. Much of this can be attributed to people who had heard about the match giving their take of it on the Internet.\n\nDespite the fact that this event was publicised as having a gory match and the preceding warning, people complained that the match in question was 'too much'. A concerned mother called Melbourne Talkback radio station 3AW, and a wrestler heard this call and also rang in. This resulted in the main media outlets covering the story. For the record, neither of the wrestlers were seriously injured. It also resulted in a police investigation. and a furore within the local Knox City Council.\n\nIndividual wrestlers originating in Australia have struggled for the most part to obtain any international recognition. Perhaps the two biggest names when one mentions Australia are the Fabulous Kangaroos - Roy Heffernan and Al Costello. They are the only Australian wrestlers to make it big in the United States and held the Florida and Texas versions of the NWA World Tag Team titles as well as the north east version of the NWA United States tag team titles in the Capitol Wrestling Corporation (later to become WWE) on three occasions, as well as being inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.\n\nAustralian wrestler Peter Stilsbury was brought into the WWF in the mid-1980s under the name Outback Jack in response to the mainstream popularity at the time of the Australian film \"Crocodile Dundee\". He appeared in several vignettes hyping his debut by showing Jack in the wilds of the Australian Outback, drinking beer with cows, and came down to the ring to the theme song by Rolf Harris, \"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\". Outback Jack started his career touring in Canada with Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling.\n\nIn more recent times Nathan Jones made two WWE appearances in 2003 at WrestleMania XIX and at Survivor Series later that same year even though he only actually wrestled at the latter event, making him the first Australian wrestler to ever perform on a WWE pay-per-view event. Jones also performed on two World Wrestling All-Stars pay-per-views, losing to Jeff Jarrett at WWA: The Inception and to Scott Steiner at WWA: The Eruption.\n\nIn late 2011, WWE signed an Australian female wrestler Tenille Dashwood to its development territory NXT. She was originally from Melbourne. Dashwood debuted as a clumsy dancer Emma, and in early 2014 was elevated to the main roster. On 6 April 2014 she became only the second Australian wrestler to perform on a WWE pay per view and the first ever woman to do so when she was a part of the Diva's Title match at WrestleMania XXX. She later appeared at the 2014 Survivor Series in November. In 2017 she became the first Australian to perform at three WWE pay per view events when she was part of the fatal five way for the Raw Women's Championship at No Mercy. She made it four at TLC in opposition to Asuka.\n\nIn early 2013, WWE signed another Australian wrestler Buddy Murphy, known in Australia as Matt Silva to NXT. Murphy made his televised debut on NXT 15 May 2014, teaming with Elias Samson in a losing effort against The Ascension. In August 2014, Murphy began teaming with American Wesley Blake and in January 2015, Murphy and Blake scored an upset victory over the Vaudevillains and the following week defeated the Lucha Dragons to win the NXT Tag Team Championship, making Murphy the first Australian to hold a championship within the WWE. In early 2018 Murphy joined the Cruiserweight division and participated in the Cruiserweight title tournament losing to Mustafa Ali in the quarter finals. He soon become a top contender to the new champion Cedric Alexander, and he managed to defeat Alexander at WWE Super Show-Down in his main roster pay-per-view debut in his home town Melbourne to win the WWE Cruiserweight Championship.\n\nIn April 2015, WWE signed both Billie Kay and Peyton Royce to NXT. The pair later formed the team The IIconics under their original name of The Iconic Duo.. They were elevated to the main roster on the SmackDown brand just after WrestleMania 34 and made their main roster pay per view debut at WWE Super Show-Down with a victory over the team of Asuka and Naomi.\n\nIn 2017, Rhea Ripley joined WWE and participated in the Mae Young Classic. The Adelaide based wrestler known locally as Demi Bennett would go on to participate in the second Mae Young Classic in 2018, but at TV tapings in Birmingham, England Ripley became the first Australian woman to win a WWE controlled title when she defeated fellow Australian Toni Storm in a tournament final to be the inaugural winner of the WWE UK Women's Championship.\n\nOnly two other Australian wrestlers have appeared on a worldwide pay-per-view event to date at all. They are Chuck E. Chaos at \"WWA: The Eruption\" who lost to Jerry Lynn, and Mark Mercedes at WWA: The Reckoning who lost to Rick Steiner.\n\nShows from North American promotions have been held in Australia as early as 1985 when WWE toured through Melbourne, Perth, Newcastle and through Melbourne and Brisbane again in 1986. That was the last Australia saw of a live North American product until WCW did a \"Nitro\" and \"Thunder\" taping in Melbourne, a \"Nitro\" taping in Brisbane and a \"Thunder\" taping and a house show in Sydney in 2000.\n\nThe next time WWE came to Australia was for the \"WWE Global Warning Tour\" in 2002 for what was the first WWE event in Australia in 16 years. The tour drew 56,734 people in Docklands Stadium, Melbourne; it featured nine matches, where in the main event The Rock defeated Triple H and Brock Lesnar in a Triple Threat match to retain the WWE Undisputed Championship. \"Global Warning\" did not air on pay-per-view, but was released on home video. WWE has visited Australia regularly since then by touring at least once a year since 2003. WWE's NXT brand made its first tour in 2016. In October 2018, Global Warning was added to the on demand list on WWE Network.\n\nIn 2018 WWE announced WWE Super Show-Down at the MCG - the first ever WWE pay per view to be held in Australia.\n\nIn 2000, I-Generation Superstars of Wrestling held a pay-per-view in Sydney headlined \"Rodman Down Under\" where Dennis Rodman would lose to Curt Hennig with the i-Generation Championship being contested.\n\nAustralia also hosted shows presented by World Wrestling All-Stars, including two pay per views - Inception in Sydney and Eruption in Melbourne. In 2016, House of Hardcore presented House Of Hardcore 15 in Melbourne. Various smaller shows have featured overseas talent, but nothing else of note.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, both \"WCW Monday Nitro\" and \"Raw\" were broadcast pay television networks with WCW Monday Nitro on TNT and WWE Raw on Fox Sports . WWE's major pay-per-views Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam and Survivor Series began to be shown on pay-per-view by the late 1990s.\n\nIn September 2002 negotiations between FOX8 and WWE fell through and \"SmackDown!\" was cancelled. A special NWA-TNA package replaced it in early 2003 but only lasted a year. NWA-TNA pay-per-views were shown once a month throughout 2003 during a time when they were being presented weekly in the United States. WWE pay-per-views were also lost to Main Event in the same deal that cost Australian fans SmackDown. Village Cinemas showed them for a few months until August 2003 when \"SmackDown!\" returned on Saturday nights as well as the pay-per-views, starting with SummerSlam. \"RAW\" was moved from Fox Sports to FOX8 and was shown on Friday nights. In order to prevent spoiler hunting on the internet, FOX8 moved WWE programming to timeslots closer to their United States air date.\n\nIn February 2005, \"WWE Heat\", \"WWE Velocity\" and \"The WWE Experience\" were added to Fox8 and set up a large wrestling program on Saturdays and Sundays. Despite \"Heat\", \"Velocity\" and \"Experience\" all being cancelled in the United States the shows continued to be shown in Australia to fulfill contractual obligations. When \"SmackDown!\" was moved to Friday nights in the United States, in Australia it remained on Friday afternoons. \"ECW on Sci Fi \" began broadcasting in Australia from 2 September 2006 in the place of \"WWE Velocity\" on Saturdays and the WWE Fanatic Series began airing in October 2006.\n\nRAW has been airing in Australia on Fox8 since late 2003 on tape delay. But it start airing RAW live on 4 February 2014\n\nAfter just over 3 years, TNA made its return. Beginning with \"TNA Sacrifice 2006\" on 27 May 2006 on tape delay. This continued for 12 months before events started being broadcast live in May 2007. \"TNA Impact!\" began airing on 5 April 2008 on Fox8. TNA Impact had been airing on Saturday nights on Fuel TV at 8.30pm AEST from June 2011, but this ceased in November 2014 when Fuel was absorbed by Fox Sports. For the remainder of 2014 and into 2015 it was shown on Main Event free of the usual charges, until 27 June 2015.\n\nFree to air wrestling programming has been scarce on Australian television in recent times. However, with the conversion to Digital Television, several wrestling programs were purchased. In June 2008, WWE After Burn aired on Channel 9 on Sunday afternoon. However, it later aired at 1am on Tuesday mornings. TNA Xplosion began airing on One HD in prime time at 8:30pm on Thursday but by late 2010 it had been replaced in effect by the WWE Experience. \n\nA cut down, one hour version of WWE Raw and SmackDown Live now air on Nine Network's 9Go!.\n\nPay-per-views in Australia are shown on Main Event, the only provider in Australia. Main Event has been broadcasting pay-per-views for both WWE starting from the late 1990s until the present time (including the Fanatic Series from 2006) and WCW pay-per-views from around the same time until they were bought out in March 2001. Main Event also began broadcasting TNA pay-per-views in May 2006, starting with Sacrifice. One year later, TNA pay per views were lifted from the 13-day tape delay format to a live format. This ceased after the transmission of Slammiversary on 29 June 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "494313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=494313", "title": "Second Italo-Ethiopian War", "text": "Second Italo-Ethiopian War\n\nThe Second Italo-Ethiopian War, also referred to as the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, was a colonial war fought from 3 October 1935 until 19 February 1937, although Addis Ababa was captured on 5 May 1936. The war was fought between the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy and those of the Ethiopian Empire (also known as Abyssinia). Ethiopia was defeated, annexed and subjected to military occupation. The Ethiopian Empire became a part of the Italian colony of Italian East Africa. Fighting continued until the Italian defeat in East Africa in 1941, during the East African Campaign of the Second World War.\n\nItaly and Ethiopia were members of the League of Nations yet the League was unable to control Italy or to protect Ethiopia when Italy violated Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Abyssinia Crisis of 1935 is often seen as a clear demonstration of the ineffectiveness of the League.\n\nThe Italian victory coincided with the zenith of the popularity of dictator Benito Mussolini and the Fascist regime at home and abroad. Ethiopia was consolidated with Eritrea and Italian Somaliland into \"Africa Orientale Italiana\" (Italian East Africa).\n\nEver since the 1880s, Italy had been committed to an imperialist policy in the Horn of Africa with Italy taking Eritrea in 1885, and subsequently parts of Somalia. The First Italo-Ethiopian War in which Italy invaded Ethiopia ended with a humiliating defeat for Italy at the last battle, the Battle of Adwa, and caused the downfall of the ultra-imperialist government of Crispi. The decisive victory by the Ethiopians over the Italians at Adwa completely destroyed the Italian forces and humiliated their country. In 1906, a secret Anglo-Italo-French agreement had consigned Ethiopia to the Italian sphere of influence and the \"Regio Esercito\" had started planning for an invasion of Ethiopia in 1908. However, successive Italian governments had more pressing priorities than \"avenging Adowa\", however great the popular clamor might be, and the strategy favored by the Foreign Ministry was one of \"friendship\" and \"peaceful penetration\", bringing Ethiopia into the Italian economic sphere of influence as the prelude to placing it in the political sphere of influence. \n\nIn the 1920s, the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini continued the same policies as his predecessors towards Ethiopia, not least because Italy was fully involved in the \"pacification of Libya\" and could not afford to fight two major colonial wars at once. In 1925, Mussolini wrote that he would pursue an \"integral violent solution\" to the \"problem\" of Ethiopia when the time was right. Raffaele Guariglia, who served as the Director of European Affairs at the Foreign Ministry, wrote in a 1931 memo that Italy had ambitions in Ethiopia that would be achieved \"probably with war\". In January 1932, the Foreign Minister Dino Grandi described the policy of \"peaceful penetration\" as a failure, writing that a policy of \"politica periferica\" was needed, and advised that the \"Regio Esercito\" should start planning for an aggressive war. Guariglia in a memo in August 1932 wrote that Italy should invade Ethiopia provided that Britain and France agreed to support the invasion first. Later in 1932, Mussolini ordered his Minister of Colonies, Emilio De Bono, to start planning for an invasion of Ethiopia to be launched in the near-future. However, the commander of the \"Regio Esercito\", Marshal Pietro Badoglio, partly out of jealousy that De Bono was to lead the planned invasion, launched a scathing critique of the De Bono plan, arguing that Italy needed larger forces and a greater logistics basis for an invasion. Largely as a response to Badoglio's objections, Mussolini very reluctantly agreed to upgrade the ports, roads and railroads in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland to support the 300,000 men force that Badoglio insisted was necessary. On 30 December 1934, Mussolini gave orders for the \"whole destruction of the Ethiopian armed forces and the occupation of the whole of Ethiopia\". \nMussoini's reasons for the invasion have been much debated by historians. The Italian historians' Franco Catalano and Giorgio Rochat argue that the invasion was an act of social imperialism, contending that the Great Depression had badly damaged Mussolini's prestige, and that he needed a foreign war to distract public opinion. Other historians such as Pietro Pastorelli have seen the invasion as more due to plans that Mussolini had long nurtured for an empire in the Horn of Africa and Arabia. Greek historian Aristotle Kallis noted in the early 1930s that Mussolini had seriously considered invading Yemen to give Italy a foothold in the Middle East, and only chose Ethiopia partly in order to \"avenge Adowa\" and partly because Ethiopia was considered to be the weaker opponent. American historian MacGregor Knox argued that Mussolini launched the war for both domestic and foreign policy reasons, arguing that Mussolini both wanted an empire abroad for its own sake and because he wanted a foreign policy triumph to push the Fascist system in a more radical direction in the face of opposition from the Crown, the Catholic Church, and other vested interests in Italy. \n\nThe decision for war was supported by the traditional elites in Italy. The Italian professional diplomats were loyal to the Fascist regime, but often sought to \"moderate\" Mussolini's more reckless impulses. The ambitions of Adolf Hitler towards Austria, which Mussolini viewed as being in the Italian sphere of influence, made for antagonistic relations between Berlin and Rome, but \"Il Duce\" often stated that were it not for the \"Austrian question\", Hitler would be an ideal ally, which alarmed the Foreign Ministry. Mussolini's hostility to his archenemy, King Alexander of Yugoslavia, led him to periodically consider attacking Yugoslavia all through the 1920s-30s, which gravely worried the traditional elites in both the military and diplomatic corps, who objected that Yugoslavia had an alliance with France, and that any Italo-Yugoslav war would automatically become a Franco-Italian war. Mussolini's anti-Yugoslav and anti-French inclinations led him, despite the \"Austrian question\", to consider an alliance with Germany, which was vehemently opposed by the Foreign Ministry, as Fulvio Suvich, the under-secretary at the Foreign Ministry, repeatedly warned that a Europe dominated by Germany would in the long run offer Italy less opportunity than a Europe dominated by France. From the viewpoint of the Foreign Ministry, it was better for Mussolini to have an \"adventure\" in Ethiopia rather than Yugoslavia, which would cause a war with France that Italy would probably lose; thus, the diplomats did everything to encourage Mussolini to attack Ethiopia as the \"lesser evil\" compared to attacking Yugoslavia. The Catholic Church, which was one of the most powerful institutions in Italy, supported war against Ethiopia as a \"civilizing mission\", seeing a chance to convert millions of followers of the Orthodox church to Catholicism. King Victor Emmanuel III wanted to avenge the defeat at Adowa, which was the greatest humiliation of his father's reign, though in the summer of 1935 the king counselled caution when it became clear that Britain was opposed to attacking Ethiopia . Marshal Badoglio was willing to support an invasion of Ethiopia provided that he rather than De Bono would command it.      \n\nThe Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928 stated that the border between Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia was twenty-one leagues parallel to the Benadir coast (approximately ). In 1930, Italy built a fort at the Welwel oasis (also \"Walwal\", Italian: \"Ual-Ual\") in the Ogaden and garrisoned it with Somali dubats (irregular frontier troops commanded by Italian officers). The fort at Welwel was well beyond the twenty-one league limit and inside Ethiopian territory. On 23 November 1934, an Anglo–Ethiopian boundary commission studying grazing grounds to find a definitive border between British Somaliland and Ethiopia arrived at Wal Wal. The party contained Ethiopian and British technicians and an escort of around 600 Ethiopian soldiers. Both sides knew that the Italians had installed a military post at Wal Wal and were not surprised to see an Italian flag at the wells. The Ethiopian government had notified the Italian authorities in Italian Somaliland that the commission was active in the Ogaden and requested that the Italians co-operate. When the British Commissioner, Lieutenant-Colonel Esmond Clifford asked the Italians for permission to camp nearby, the Italian commander Captain Roberto Cimmaruta rebuffed the request.\n\nFitorari Shiferra, the commander of the Ethiopian escort, took no notice of the and Somali troops and made camp. To avoid being caught in an Italian–Ethiopian incident, Clifford withdrew the British contingent to Ado, about to the north-east, and Italian aircraft began to fly over Wal Wal. The Ethiopian commissioners retired with the British but the escort remained and for ten days both sides exchanged menaces, sometimes no more than apart. Reinforcements increased the Ethiopian contingent to about 1,500 men and the Italians to about 500, and on 5 December shots were fired. The Italians were supported by an armoured car and bomber aircraft; the bombs missed but machine-gun fire from the car caused about 110 Ethiopian casualties. From 30 to 50 Italians and Somalis were also killed and the incident led to the \"Abyssinia Crisis\" at the League of Nations. On 4 September 1935, the League of Nations exonerated both parties for the Wal Wal Incident.\n\nBritain and France, preferring Italy as an ally against Germany, did not take strong steps to discourage an Italian military buildup on the borders of Ethiopia in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. On 7 January 1935, a Franco-Italian Agreement was made giving Italy essentially a free hand in Africa in return for Italian co-operation. In April, Italy was further emboldened by participation in the Stresa Front, an agreement to curb further German violations of the Treaty of Versailles. In June, non-interference was further assured by a political rift that had developed between the United Kingdom and France following the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. A last possible foreign ally of Ethiopia to fall away was Japan, which had served as a model to some Ethiopian intellectuals; the Japanese ambassador to Italy, Dr. Sugimura Yotaro, on 16 July assured Mussolini that his country held no political interests in Ethiopia and would stay neutral in the coming war. His comments stirred up a furore inside Japan, where there had been popular affinity for the African Empire. Despite popular opinion, when the Ethiopians approached Japan for help on 2 August they were refused, and even a modest request for the Japanese government to officially state its support for Ethiopia in the coming conflict was denied.\n\nWith war appearing inevitable, the Emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, ordered a general mobilisation of the Army of the Ethiopian Empire.\n\nSelassie's army consisted of around 500,000 men, some of whom were armed with spears and bows; other soldiers carried more modern weapons, including rifles but many of these were pre-1900 equipments and obsolete. According to Italian estimates, on the eve of hostilities, the Ethiopians had an army of 350,000–760,000 men. Only about 25 percent of the army had any military training and the men were armed with a motley of 400,000 rifles of every type and in every condition. The Ethiopian armies had about 234 antiquated pieces of artillery mounted on rigid gun carriages, as well as a dozen 3.7 cm PaK 35/36 anti-tank guns. The army had about 800 light Colt and Hotchkiss machine-guns and 250 heavy Vickers and Hotchkiss machine guns, about 100 .303-inch Vickers guns on AA mounts, 48 20 mm Oerlikon S anti-aircraft guns and some recently purchased Canon de 75 CA modèle 1917 Schneider field guns. The arms embargo imposed on the belligerents by France and Britain disproportionately affected Ethiopia, which lacked the manufacturing industry to produce its own weapons. The Ethiopian army had some 300 trucks, seven Ford A-based armoured cars and four World War I era Fiat 3000 tanks.\n\nThe best Ethiopian units were the Emperor's \"Kebur Zabagna\" (Imperial Guard), who were well-trained and better equipped than the other Ethiopian troops. The Imperial Guard wore a distinctive greenish-khaki uniform of the Belgian Army, which stood out from the white cotton cloak (\"shamma\") worn by most Ethiopian fighters and which proved to be an excellent target. The skills of the \"Rases\", the generals of the Ethiopian armies, were reported to rate from relatively good to incompetent. After Italian objections to an Anschluss with Austria, Germany sent three aeroplanes, 10,000 Mauser rifles and 10 million rounds of ammunition to the Ethiopians.\n\nThe serviceable portion of the Imperial Ethiopian Air Force under the command of the French Andre Maillet, included three obsolete Potez 25 biplanes. A few transport aircraft had been acquired between 1934 and 1935 for ambulance work but the air force consisted of 13 aircraft and four pilots at the outbreak of the war. Airspeed in England had a surplus Viceroy racing plane and director Neville Shute was delighted with a good offer for the \"white elephant\" in August 1935. The agent said it was to fly cinema films around Europe. When the client wanted bomb racks to carry the (flammable) films, Shute agreed to fit lugs under the wings to which they could attach \"anything they liked\". He was told that the plane was to be used to bomb the Italian oil storage tanks at Massawa, and when the C.I.D. enquired about the alien (ex-German) pilot practising on it Shute got the impression that the Foreign Office did not object. But fuel plus bombs and bomb racks from Finland could not be got to Ethiopia in time, and the (paid-for) Viceroy stayed at their works. The Emperor of Ethiopia had £16,000 to spend on modern aircraft to resist the Italians, and planned to spend £5000 on the Viceroy and the rest on three Gloucester Gladiator fighters. \n\nFifty foreign mercenaries joined the Ethiopian forces, including French pilots like Pierre Corriger, the Trinidadian pilot Hubert Julian, an official Swedish military mission under Captain Viking Tamm, the White Russian Feodor Konovalov and the Czechoslovak writer Adolf Parlesak. Several Austrian Nazis, a team of Belgian Fascists and Cuban mercenary Alejandro del Valle also fought for Haile Selassie. Many of these individuals were military advisers, pilots, doctors or supporters of the Ethiopian cause; fifty mercenaries fought in the Ethiopian army and another fifty people were active in the Ethiopian Red Cross or non-military activities. The Italians later attributed most of the relative success achieved by the Ethiopians to foreigners or \"ferenghi\". (The Italian propaganda machine magnified the number to thousands, to explain away the Ethiopian Christmas Offensive of late 1935.)\n\nThere were 400,000 Italian soldiers in Eritrea and 285,000 in Italian Somaliland with 3,300 machine guns, 275 artillery pieces, 200 tankettes and 205 aircraft. In April 1935, the reinforcement of the Royal Italian Army (\"Regio Esercito\") and the \"Regia Aeronautica\" (Royal Air Force) in East Africa (\"Africa Orientale\") accelerated. Eight regular, mountain and blackshirt militia infantry divisions arrived in Eritrea and four regular infantry divisions arrived in Italian Somaliland, consisting of about 685,000 soldiers and a great number of logistical and support units; the Italian force included 200 journalists. The Italian force had 6,000 machine guns, 2,000 pieces of artillery, 599 tanks and 390 aircraft. The \"Regia Marina\" (Royal Navy) carried tons of ammunition, food and other supplies, with the motor vehicles to move them, while the Ethiopians had only horse-drawn carts.\n\nThe Italians placed considerable reliance on their Royal Corps of Colonial Troops (\"Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali\", RCTC) of indigenous regiments recruited from the Italian colonies of Eritrea, Somalia, and Libya. The most effective of these Italian commanded units were the Eritrean native infantry (\"Ascari\") who were often used as advanced troops. The Eritreans also provided cavalry and artillery units; the \"Falcon Feathers\" (\"Penne di Falco\") was one prestigious and colourful Eritrean cavalry unit. Other RCTC units employed in the invasion of Ethiopia were irregular Somali frontier troops (\"dubats\"), regular Arab-Somali infantry and artillery and infantry from Libya. The Italians had a variety of local semi-independent \"allies\", in the north, the Azebu Galla were among several groups induced to fight for the Italians. In the south, the Somali Sultan Olol Dinle commanded a personal army that advanced into the northern Ogaden with the forces of Colonel Luigi Frusci. The Sultan was motivated by his desire to take back lands that the Ethiopians had taken from him. The Italian colonial forces even included men from Yemen, across the Gulf of Aden.\n\nThe Italians were reinforced by volunteers from the so-called \"Italiani all'estero\" (Italian emigres from Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil) who formed the 221st Legion in the \"Divisione Tevere\" and a special \"Legione Parini\", that fought under Frusci near Dire Dawa. On 28 March 1935, General Emilio De Bono was named as the Commander-in-Chief of all Italian armed forces in East Africa. De Bono was also the Commander-in-Chief of the forces invading from Eritrea on the northern front. De Bono commanded nine divisions in the Italian I Corps, the Italian II Corps and the Eritrean Corps. General Rodolfo Graziani was Commander-in-Chief of forces invading from Italian Somaliland on the southern front. Initially he had two divisions and a variety of smaller units under his command, a mixture of Italians, Somalis, Eritreans, Libyans and others. De Bono regarded Italian Somaliland as a secondary theatre that needed primarily to defend itself and possibly aid the main front with offensive thrusts if the enemy forces there were not too large. Most foreigners accompanied the Ethiopians but Herbert Matthews, a reporter, historian and author of \"Eyewitness in Abyssinia: With Marshal Bodoglio's forces to Addis Ababa\" (1937) accompanied the Italian forces.\n\nAt 5:00 am on 3 October 1935, De Bono crossed the Mareb River and advanced into Ethiopia from Eritrea without a declaration of war. Aircraft of the \"Regia Aeronautica\" scattered leaflets asking the population to rebel against Haile Selassie and support the \"true Emperor Iyasu V\". Forty-year-old Iyasu had been deposed many years earlier but was still in custody. In response to the Italian invasion, Ethiopia declared war on Italy. At this point in the campaign, the lack of roads represented a serious hindrance for the Italians as they crossed into Ethiopia. On the Italian side, roads had been constructed right up to the border. On the Ethiopian side, these roads often transitioned into vaguely defined paths. On 5 October the Italian I Corps took Adigrat, and by 6 October, Adwa (Adowa) was captured by the Italian II Corps. Haile Selassie had ordered Duke (\"Ras\") Seyoum Mangasha, the Commander of the Ethiopian Army of Tigre, to withdraw a day's march away from the Mareb River. Later, the Emperor ordered his son-in-law and Commander of the Gate (\"Dejazmach\") Haile Selassie Gugsa, also in the area, to move back from the border.\n\nOn 11 October, Gugsa surrendered with 1,200 followers at the Italian outpost at Adagamos; Italian propagandists lavishly publicised the surrender but fewer than a tenth of Gugsa's men defected with him. On 14 October, De Bono proclaimed the end of slavery in Ethiopia but this liberated the former slave owners from the obligation to feed their former slaves, in the unsettled conditions caused by the war. Much of the livestock in the area had been moved to the south to feed the Ethiopian army and many of the emancipated people had no choice but to appeal to the Italian authorities for food. By 15 October, De Bono's forces had advanced from Adwa and occupied the holy capital of Axum. De Bono entered the city riding triumphantly on a white horse and then looted the Obelisk of Axum. To Mussolini's dismay, the advance was methodical and on 8 November, the I Corps and the Eritrean Corps captured Makale. The Italian advance had added to the line of supply and De Bono wanted to build a road from Adigrat before continuing. On 16 November, De Bono was promoted to the rank of Marshal of Italy (\"Maresciallo d'Italia\") and in December was replaced by Badoglio to speed up the invasion.\nOn 14 November 1935, the National government in Britain led by Stanley Baldwin won a general election on a platform of upholding collective security and support for the League of Nations, which at least implied that Britain would support Ethiopia. However, the British service chiefs led by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Earle Chatfield, all advised against going to war with Italy for the sake of Ethiopia, advice that carried much weight with the cabinet. During the 1935 election, Baldwin and the rest of the cabinet had repeatedly promised that Britain was committed to upholding collective security, believing this was the best way to neutralise the Labour Party, which likewise had run on a platform emphasising collective security and support for the League of Nations. To square the circle caused by its election promises vs. its desire not to offend Mussolini too much, the Baldwin cabinet decided upon a plan that would give most of Ethiopia to Italy with the rest in the Italian sphere of influence as the best way of ending the war. In early December 1935, the Hoare–Laval Pact was proposed by Britain and France. Under this pact, Italy would gain the best parts of Ogaden, Tigray and economic influence over all the southern part of Abyssinia. Abyssinia would have a guaranteed corridor to the sea at the port of Assab; the corridor was a poor one and known as a \"corridor for camels\". Mussolini was ready to agree but he waited some days to make his opinion public. On 13 December, details of the pact were leaked by a French newspaper and denounced as a sell-out of the Ethiopians. The British government disassociated itself from the pact and the British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare was forced to resign in disgrace.\n\nThe Christmas Offensive was intended to split the Italian forces in the north with the Ethiopian centre, crushing the Italian left with the Ethiopian right and to invade Eritrea with the Ethiopian left. \"Ras\" Seyum Mangasha held the area around Abiy Addi with about 30,000 men. Selassie with about 40,000 men advanced from Gojjam toward Mai Timket to the left of \"Ras\" Seyoum. \"Ras\" Kassa Haile Darge with around 40,000 men advanced from Dessie to support \"Ras\" Seyoum in the centre in a push towards Warieu Pass. \"Ras\" Mulugeta Yeggazu, the Minister of War, advanced from Dessie with approximately 80,000 men to take positions on and around Amba Aradam to the right of \"Ras\" Seyoum. Amba Aradam was a steep sided, flat topped mountain directly in the way of an Italian advance on Addis Ababa. The four commanders had approximately 190,000 men facing the Italians. \"Ras\" Imru and his Army of Shire were on the Ethiopian left. \"Ras\" Seyoum and his Army of Tigre and \"Ras\" Kassa and his Army of Beghemder were the Ethiopian centre. \"Ras\" Mulugeta and his \"Army of the Center\" (\"Mahel Sefari\") were on the Ethiopian right.\n\nA force of 1,000 Ethiopians crossed the Tekeze river and advanced toward the Dembeguina Pass (Inda Aba Guna or Indabaguna pass). The Italian commander, Major Criniti, commanded a force of 1,000 Eritrean infantry supported by L3 tanks. When the Ethiopians attacked, the Italian force fell back to the pass, only to discover that 2,000 Ethiopian soldiers were already there and Criniti's force was encircled. In the first Ethiopian attack, two Italian officers were killed and Criniti was wounded. The Italians tried to break out using their L3 tanks but the rough terrain immobilised the vehicles. The Ethiopians killed the infantry, then rushed the tanks and killed their two-man crews. Italian forces organised a relief column made up of tanks and infantry to relieve Critini but it was ambushed en route. Ethiopians on the high ground rolled boulders in front of and behind several of the tanks, to immobilise them, picked off the Eritrean infantry and swarmed the tanks. The other tanks were immobilised by the terrain, unable to advance further and two were set on fire. Critini managed to break-out in a bayonet charge and half escaped; Italian casualties were 31 Italians and 370 Askari killed and five Italians taken prisoner; Ethiopian casualties were estimated by the Italians to be 500, which was probably greatly exaggerated.\n\nThe ambitious Ethiopian plan called for \"Ras\" Kassa and \"Ras\" Seyoum to split the Italian army in two and isolate the Italian I Corps and III Corps in Mekele. \"Ras\" Mulugeta would then descend from Amba Aradam and crush both corps. According to this plan, after \"Ras\" Imru retook Adwa, he was to invade Eritrea. In November, the League of Nations condemned Italy's aggression and imposed economic sanctions. This excluded oil, however, an indispensable raw material for the conduct of any modern military campaign, and this favoured Italy. The Ethiopian offensive was defeated by the Italian superiority in modern weapons like machine guns and heavy artillery. The Ethiopians were very poorly armed, with few machine guns, their troops mainly armed with swords and spears. Having spent a decade accumulating poison gas in East Africa, Mussolini gave Badoglio authority to resort to \"Schrecklichkeit\" (frightfulness), which included destroying villages and using gas (OC 23/06, 28 December 1935); Mussolini was even prepared to resort to bacteriological warfare as long as these methods could be kept quiet. Some Italians objected when they found out but the practices were kept secret, the government issuing denials or spurious stories blaming the Ethiopians.\n\nAs the progress of the Christmas Offensive slowed, Italian plans to renew the advance on the northern front began as Mussolini had given permission to use poison gas (but not mustard gas) and Badoglio received the Italian III Corps and the Italian IV Corps in Eritrea during early 1936. On 20 January, the Italians resumed their northern offensive at the First Battle of Tembien (20 to 24 January) in the broken terrain between the Warieu Pass and Makale. The forces of Ras Kassa were defeated, the Italians using phosgene gas and suffering 1,082 casualties against 8,000 Ethiopian casualties according to an Ethiopian wireless message intercepted by the Italians.\n\nFrom 10 to 19 February, the Italians captured Amba Aradam and destroyed \"Ras\" Mulugeta's army in the Battle of Amba Aradam (Battle of Enderta). The Ethiopians suffered massive losses and poison gas destroyed a small part of \"Ras\" Mulugeta's army, according to the Ethiopians. During the slaughter following the attempted withdrawal of his army, both \"Ras\" Mulugeta and his son were killed. The Italians lost 800 killed and wounded while the Ethiopians lost 6,000 killed and 12,000 wounded. From 27 to 29 February, the armies of \"Ras\" Kassa and \"Ras\" Seyoum were destroyed at the Second Battle of Tembien. Ethiopians again argued that poison gas played a role in the destruction of the withdrawing armies. In early March, the army of \"Ras\" Imru was attacked, bombed and defeated in what was known as the Battle of Shire. In the battles of Amba Aradam, Tembien and Shire, the Italians suffered about 2,600 casualties and the Ethiopians about 15,000; Italian casualties at the Battle of Shire being 969 men. The Italian victories stripped the Ethiopian defences on the northern front, Tigré province had fallen most of the Ethiopian survivors returned home or took refuge in the countryside and only the army guarding Addis Ababa stood between the Italians and the rest of the country.\n\nOn 31 March 1936 at the Battle of Maychew, the Italians defeated an Ethiopian counter-offensive by the main Ethiopian army commanded by Selassie. The Ethiopians launched near non-stop attacks on the Italian and Eritrean defenders but could not overcome the well-prepared Italian defences. When the exhausted Ethiopians withdrew, the Italians counter-attacked. The \"Regia Aeronautica\" attacked the survivors at Lake Ashangi with mustard gas. The Italian troops had 400 casualties, the Eritreans 874 and the Ethiopians suffered 8,900 casualties from 31,000 men present according to an Italian estimate. On 4 April, Selassie looked with despair upon the horrific sight of the dead bodies of his army ringing the poisoned lake. Following the battle, Ethiopian soldiers began to employ guerrilla tactics against the Italians, initiating a trend of resistance that would transform into the Patriot/\"Arbegnoch\" movement. They were joined by local residents who operated independently near their own homes. Early activities included stealing war materials, rolling boulders off cliffs at passing convoys, kidnapping messengers, cutting telephone lines, setting fire to administrative offices and fuel and ammunition dumps, and killing collaborators. As disruption increased, the Italians were forced to redeploy more troops to Tigray, away from the campaign further south.\n\nOn 3 October 1935, Graziani implemented the Milan Plan to remove Ethiopian forces from various frontier posts and to test the reaction to a series of probes all along the southern front. While incessant rains worked to hinder the plan, within three weeks the Somali villages of Kelafo, Dagnerai, Gerlogubi and Gorahai in Ogaden were in Italian hands. Late in the year, \"Ras\" Desta Damtu assembled up his army in the area around Negele Borana, to advance on Dolo and invade Italian Somaliland. Between 12 and 16 January 1936, the Italians defeated the Ethiopians at the Battle of Genale Doria. The \"Regia Aeronautica\" destroyed the army of \"Ras\" Desta, Ethiopians claiming that poison gas was used.\n\nAfter a lull in February 1936, the Italians in the south prepared an advance towards the city of Harar. On 22 March, the \"Regia Aeronautica\" bombed Harar and Jijiga, reducing them to ruins even though Harar had been declared an \"open city\". On 14 April, Graziani launched his attack against \"Ras\" Nasibu Emmanual to defeat the last Ethiopian army in the field at the Battle of the Ogaden. The Ethiopians were drawn up behind a defensive line that was termed the \"Hindenburg Wall\", designed by the chief of staff of Ras Nasibu, and Wehib Pasha, a seasoned ex-Ottoman commander. After ten days, the last Ethiopian army had disintegrated; 2,000 Italian soldiers and 5,000 Ethiopian soldiers were killed or wounded.\n\nOn 26 April 1936, Badoglio began the \"March of the Iron Will\" from Dessie to Addis Ababa, an advance with a mechanised column against slight Ethiopian resistance. The column experienced a more serious attack on 4 May when Ethiopian forces under Haile Mariam Mammo ambushed the formation in Chacha, near Debre Berhan, killing approximately 170 colonial troops.\n\nMeanwhile, Selassie conducted a disorganized retreat towards the capital. There, government officials operated without leadership, unable to contact the Emperor and unsure of his whereabouts. Realizing that Addis Ababa would soon fall to the Italians, Ethiopian administrators met to discuss a possible evacuation of the government to the west. After several days, they decided that they should relocate to Gore, though actual preparations for their departure were postponed. Addis Ababa became crowded with retreating soldiers from the front while its foreign residents sought refuge at various European legations. Selassie reached the capital on 30 April. That day his Council of Ministers resolved that the city should be defended and a retreat to Gore conducted only as a last resort. The following day an ad hoc council of Ethiopian nobles convened to reexamine the decision, where Ras Aberra Kassa suggested that the Emperor should go to Geneva to appeal to the League of Nations for assistance before returning to lead resistance against the Italians. The view was subsequently adopted by Selassie and preparations were made for his departure. On 2 May, Selassie boarded a train from Addis Ababa to Djibouti, with the gold of the Ethiopian Central Bank. From there he fled to the United Kingdom, with the tacit acquiescence of the Italians who could have bombed his train, into exile (Mussolini had refused a request from Graziani to mount such an attack). \n\nBefore he departed, Selassie ordered that the government of Ethiopia be moved to Gore and directed the mayor of Addis Ababa to maintain order in the city until the Italians' arrival. Imru Haile Selassie was appointed Prince Regent during his absence. The city police, under Abebe Aregai and the remainder of the Imperial Guard did their utmost to restrain a growing crowd but rioters rampaged throughout the city, looting and setting fire to shops owned by Europeans. Most of the violence occurred between looters, fighting over the spoils and by 5 May, much of the city lay in ruins. At 04:00 Badoglio drove into the city at the head of 1,600 lorries and patrols of Italian tanks, troops and Carabinieri were sent to occupy tactically valuable areas in the city, as the remaining inhabitants watched sullenly.\n\nAfter the occupation of Addis Ababa, nearly half of Ethiopia was still unoccupied and the fighting continued for another three years until nearly 90% was \"pacified\" just before World War II, although censorship kept this from the Italian public. Ethiopian commanders withdrew to nearby areas to regroup; Abebe Aregai went to Ankober, Balcha Safo to Gurage, Zewdu Asfaw to Mulo, Blatta Takale Wolde Hawariat to Limmu and the Kassa brothers (Aberra, Wondosson and Asfawossen) to Selale. Haile Mariam conducted hit-and-run attacks around the capital. About 10,000 troops remaining under the command of Aberra Kassa had orders from Selassie to continue resistance. On 21 June Kassa held a meeting with Bishop Abune Petros and several other Patriot leaders at Debre Libanos, about north of Addis Ababa. Plans were made to storm parts of the capital but a lack of transport and radio equipment prevented a co-ordinated attack. The exiled government in Gore was never able to provide any meaningful leadership to the Patriots or remaining military formations but sporadic resistance by independent groups persisted around the capital. On the night 26 June, members of the Black Lions organization destroyed three Italian aircraft in Nekemte and killed twelve Italian officials, including Air Marshal after the Italians had sent the party to parley with the local populace. Graziani ordered the town to be bombed in retaliation for the killings (Magliocco was his deputy). Local hostility forced out the Patriots and Desta Damtew, commander of the southern Patriots, withdrew his troops to Arbegona. Surrounded by Italian forces, they retreated to Butajira, where they were eventually defeated. An estimated 4,000 Patriots were reportedly killed in both engagements, 1,600 of whom—including Damtew—after being taken prisoner.\n\nIn 1968, Colonel A. J. Barker, apparently using statistics from Italy, wrote that from 1 January 1935 to 31 May 1936, the Italian army and Blackshirt units lost killed, died of wounds and thirty-one missing; about troops and workmen were also killed, a total of In a 1978 publication, Alberto Sbacchi wrote that these official Italian casualty figures of about an underestimate. Sbacchi calculated that by May 1936, soldiers had been killed and been wounded; from 1936 to 1940, there an additional killed and and wounded. Total Italian casualties from 1935 to 1940 according to these calculations were about 208,000 killed or wounded. Based on killed in the first six months of 1940, Ministry of Africa figures for 6 May 1936 to 10 June 1940 are killed, which Sbacchi considered to be fairly accurate. In \"Legacy of Bitterness: Ethiopia and Fascist Italy, 1935–1941\" (1997), Sbacchi wrote that the official total of Italian casualties was unreliable, because the regime desired to underestimate Italian losses.\n\nThere was a lack of reliable statistics because confusion during the invasion made it difficult to keep accurate records and the \"Statistical Bulletin\" had ceased to provide data on fatalities. Field hospital records had been destroyed, inventories dispersed, individual deaths were not reported and bodies were not repatriated to Italy. Unpublished reports listed and civilian fatalities among and from May 1936 to June 1940, there were another and civilian fatalities in In a memorandum submitted to the Paris conference in 1946, the Ethiopian government enumerated killed in action, killed in hostilities during the occupation from 1936–1941, and children killed by bombing, killed in the massacre of February 1937, died in concentration camps, killed in obedience to orders from summary courts, died after their villages had been destroyed, a total of \n\nKing-Emperor Victor Emmanuel III waited for the crowds in the Quirinal Palace on Quirinal Hill. Months earlier, when the Ethiopian adventure first started, he told a friend: \"If we win, I shall be King of Abyssinia. If we lose, I shall be King of Italy.\" \"Imperatore! Imperatore! Salute Imperatore!\" (\"Emperor! Emperor! Salute the Emperor!\") chanted the crowd when Victor Emmanuel, in full Army uniform, showed himself on a balcony. The first Emperor in Rome in hundreds of years raised his withered hand to the visor of his cap and said nothing. Elena, his Queen-Empress, did not appear. She was in bed with a broken toe from falling off a stepladder in her library while reaching for a book.\n\nWhile the Italian King-Emperor was silent, Mussolini was not; when he announced victory from the balcony of the \"Palazzo Venezia\" in Rome, the Italian population was jubilant.\n\nFrom his balcony, Mussolini proclaimed\n\nThe crowds would not let him go—ten times they recalled Mussolini to the balcony and cheered and waved while the boys of various Fascist youth organisations sang the newly composed \"Hymn of the Empire\" (\"Inno dell'impero\").\n\nFour days later, the same scene was repeated when Mussolini announced\n\nThe consequences of the victory in Ethiopia not obvious until later; Mussolini had challenged the nations of the League, had become briefly the centre of world attention and had defied British hegemony. Many sceptics in Italy were relieved and Fascism reached the apogee of its popularity; the shouts of military victory drowned out grumbles about the economy.\nWhile the Italian people were rejoicing in Rome, Haile Selassie sailed from Djibouti on 4 May, he had sailed from Djibouti in the British cruiser . From Mandatory Palestine Selassie sailed to Gibraltar en route for Britain. While in Jerusalem, Haile Selassie sent a telegram to the League of Nations,\n\nThe Ethiopian Emperor's telegram caused several nations temporarily to defer recognition of the Italian conquest.\n\nOn 30 June, Selassie spoke at the League of Nations and was introduced by the President of the Assembly as \"His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Ethiopia\" (\"Sa Majesté Imperiale, l'Empereur d'Ethiopie\"). A group of jeering Italian journalists began yelling insults and had to be ejected before he could speak. The Romanian chairman, Nicolae Titulescu, jumped to his feet and shouted \"Show the savages the door!\" (\"A la porte les sauvages!\"). Selassie denounced Italian aggression and criticised the world community for standing by. At the conclusion of his speech, which appeared on newsreels throughout the world, he said \"It is us today. It will be you tomorrow\". France appeased Italy because it could not afford to risk an alliance between Italy and Germany; Britain decided its military weakness meant it had to follow France's lead. Selassie's resolution to the League to deny recognition of the Italian conquest was defeated and he was denied a loan to finance a resistance movement. On 4 July 1936, the League voted to end the sanctions imposed against Italy in November 1935 and by 15 July, the sanctions were at an end.\n\nOn 18 November 1936, the Italian Empire was recognised by the Empire of Japan and Italy recognised the Japanese occupation of Manchuria; The Stresa Front was over. Hitler had supplied the Ethiopians with 16,000 rifles and 600 machine guns in the hope that Italy would be weakened when he moved against Austria. By contrast, France and Britain recognised Italian control over Ethiopia in 1938. Mexico was the only country to strongly condemn Italy's sovereignty over Ethiopia, respecting Ethiopian independence throughout. Mexico was amongst only six nations in 1937 which did not recognise the Italian occupation, along with China, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, the Republic of Spain and the United States. Three years later, only the USSR officially recognised Selassie and the United States government considered recognising the Italian Empire with Ethiopia included. The invasion of Ethiopia and its general condemnation by Western democracies isolated until 1938 Mussolini and Fascist Italy. From 1936 to 1939, Mussolini and Hitler joined forces in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. In April 1939, Mussolini launched the Italian invasion of Albania. In May, Italy and Nazi Germany joined together in the Pact of Steel. In September 1940, both nations signed the Tripartite Pact along with the Empire of Japan.\n\nEthiopian troops used Dum-Dum bullets, which had been banned by declaration IV, 3 of the Hague Convention (1899) and began mutilating captured Eritrean Askari (often with castration) since the first weeks of war.\n\nAfter early December, the Ethiopians began to torture and murder Italians (also civilians and women, like happened later in the \"Gondrand massacre\" where nearly 90 Italian workers were killed and mutilated), who retaliated with the initial use of some poison gas. The murder of Tito Minniti -an Italian pilot who was killed after he was captured by Ethiopians in December 1935 near Degehabur- was the atrocity story justifying the first use of mustard gas by Mussolini against the Ethiopians.\n\nIndeed, the murder of Minniti relied on the assertions of an attaché of the Egyptian Red Cross, Abdel Mohsein El Uisci, who later testified to the \"League of Nations\" and stated that the severed head and feet of Minniti were carried to the towns of Degehabur, Jijiga and Harar. El Uisci testified:\n\nItalian authorities complained with the League of nations about the barbarian practice of mutilation (of body sections and also of genitals) done by some Ethiopians with their POWs. \nSome hundreds of colonial Eritrean Ascari and dozens of Italians suffered these amputations, often done before death as happened with 17 Italian workers emasculated in Gondrand in February 1936.\n\nItalian military forces disposed of hundreds of tons of gas (from WW1) which had been transported to East Africa in the decade before the war. The Italian army used of mustard gas, despite being a signatory to the 1925 Geneva Protocol, justified by the deaths of Minniti and his observer in the Ogaden. The use of gas was authorised by Mussolini.\n\nMilitary and civilian targets were gas bombed and on 30 December, a Red Cross unit was bombed at Dolo and an Egyptian ambulance was attacked at Bulale; a few days later an Egyptian medical unit was bombed at Daggah Bur. There were more attacks in January and February, then on 4 March 1936, a British Red Cross camp near Quoram appeared to be subject to the most deliberate attack of all, when low-flying Italian aircraft crews could not have missed the big Red Cross signs. Mustard gas was also sprayed from above on Ethiopian combatants and villages. The Italians tried to keep their resort to chemical warfare secret but were exposed by the International Red Cross and many foreign observers. The Italians claimed that at least 19 bombardments of Red Cross tents \"posted in the areas of military encampment of the Ethiopian resistance\", had been \"erroneous\".\n\nThe Italians delivered poison gas by gas shell and in bombs dropped by the \"Regia Aeronautica\". Though poorly equipped, the Ethiopians had achieved some success against modern weaponry but had no defence against the \"terrible rain that burned and killed\". Anthony Mockler wrote that the effect mustard gas in battle was negligible and in 1959, D. K. Clark wrote that the US Major, Norman Fiske,\n\nItalians, like the war correspondent Indro Montanelli, noted that the Italian soldiers had no gas masks, that there was no use of gas or it was used in very small amounts if at all.\n\nThese claims are disputed by Captain Meade, the US observer with Ethiopian forces who wrote\n\nMajor General JFC Fuller, assigned to the Italian army, concluded\n\nUS military analysis concluded\n\nHaile Selassie in his report to the League of Nations described it\n\nHistorian Del Boca condemned the use of gas, according to P. Tripodi, but noted that it was minimal on the results of the war the effects of the Italian gas (the most used was \"iprite\", a gas that was not mortal like others used during WW1 in Europe: that is why the Italian troops had no antigas masks, as confirmed by Indro Montanelli). In Tripodi's opinion the gas used was only a kind of punishment against the Ethiopians for their cruelty.\n\nOn 10 May 1936, in Ethiopia Italian troops from the northern front and from the southern front met at Dire Dawa. The Italians found the recently released Ethiopian Ras, Hailu Tekle Haymanot, who boarded a train back to Addis Ababa and approached the Italian invaders in submission. Selassie fell back to Gore in southern Ethiopia to reorganise and continue to resist the Italians. In early June, Rome promulgated a constitution for \"Africa Orientale Italiana\" (AOI, Italian East Africa) bringing Ethiopia, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland together into an administrative unit of six provinces. Badoglio became the first Viceroy and Governor General but on 11 June, he was replaced by Marshal Graziani. In July, Ethiopian forces attacked Addis Ababa and were routed. Numerous members of Ethiopian royalty were taken prisoner and others were executed soon after they surrendered, including three sons of \"Ras\" Kassa. On 19 December, Wondosson Kassa was executed near Debre Zebit and on 21 December, Aberra Kassa and Asfawossen Kassa were executed in Fikke. In late 1936, after the Italians tracked him down in Gurage, \"Dejazmach\" Balcha Safo was killed resisting to the end. On 19 December, Selassie surrendered at the Gojeb river.\n\nAfter the end of the rainy season, an Italian column left Addis Ababa in September and occupied Gore a month later. The forces of \"Ras\" Imru were trapped between the Italians and the Sudan border and Imru surrendered on 17 December. Imru was flown to Italy and imprisoned on the Island of Ponza, while the rest of the Ethiopian prisoners taken in the war were dispersed in camps in East Africa and Italy. A second column went south-west to attack \"Ras\" Desta and the \"Dejasmatch\" Gabre Mariam who had assembled military forces in the Great Lakes district. The Ethiopians were defeated on 16 December and by January, the Italians had established a measure of control over the provinces of Jimma, Kafa and Arusi. After another two months, the remaining Ethiopians were surrounded and fought on, rather than surrender. Mariam was killed and Desta taken prisoner and killed, his head being displayed in Jimma.\n\nMussolini gave orders that,\n\nMost of the repression of the population was carried out by colonial troops (mostly from Eritrea) of the Italians who, according to the Ethiopians, instituted forced labour camps, installed public gallows, killed hostages and mutilated the corpses of their enemies. Many Italian troops had themselves photographed next to cadavers hanging from the gallows or standing with chests full of detached heads.\n\nCatholic reaction was mixed to the Italian conquest of Ethiopia. Fearing retribution from the National Fascist Party, some bishops gave praise. In 1973, Anthony Rhodes wrote,\n\nPope Pius XI had condemned totalitarianism in the encyclical \"Non abbiamo bisogno\" and made gestures to the Fascist regime, presenting the queen of Italy with the Golden Rose when she was made Empress of Ethiopia but despite great pressure from Mussolini refused to bless Italian armies. Pius may have refused to give absolute support to the regime but also failed to prevent Italian bishops doing it in his stead. This coincided with Mussolini's increasing anti-clericalism and he stated that \"the Papacy was a malignant tumour in the body of Italy and must 'be rooted out once and for all', because there was no room in Rome for both the Pope and [himself]\".\n\nIn December, Graziani declared the country to be pacified and under Italian control. Ethiopian resistance continued and the Italian occupation was marked by guerilla campaigns against the Italians and Italian reprisals, including mustard gas attacks against rebels and the summary execution of prisoners. On 19 February 1937, during a public ceremony at the Viceregal Palace in Addis Ababa (the former Imperial residence), Abraha Deboch and Moges Asgedom attempted to kill Graziani with hand grenades. Italian security guard fired indiscriminately into the crowd and killed about onlookers; during the night, Blackshirts went through the Ethiopian quarter and murdered people with swords, knives, rifles and bombs. When the massacre ended on 22 February, thousands of Ethiopians had been killed. Over the next few weeks, the Italian colonial authorities executed about 30,000 civilians in reprisal. About half of the younger, educated Ethiopian population were killed in what became known as Yekatit 12 (the Ethiopian calendar equivalent of 19 February). In December, \"Ras\" Desta Damtew had been forced out of his base of operations in Irgalem and was executed on 24 February; \"Dejazmach\" Beyene Merid who had just joined forces with him was also killed.\n\nIn 1937, the Italian ministry of colonies was renamed \"Ministry of Italian Africa\".\nOn 21 December 1937, Rome appointed Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta, as the new Viceroy and Governor General of AOI with instructions to take a more conciliatory line. Aosta instituted public works projects including of new paved roadways, 25 hospitals, 14 hotels, dozens of post offices, telephone exchanges, aqueducts, schools and shops. The Italians decreed miscegenation to be illegal. Racial separation, including residential segregation, was enforced as thoroughly as possible and the Italians showed favouritism to non-Christian groups. To isolate the dominant Amhara rulers of Ethiopia, who supported Selassie, the Italians granted the Oromos, the Somalis and other Muslims, many of whom had supported the invasion, autonomy and rights. The Italians also definitively abolished slavery and abrogated feudal laws that had been upheld by the Amharas. Early in 1938, a revolt broke out in Gojjam, led by the Committee of Unity and Collaboration, made up of some of the young, educated elite who had escaped reprisals after the assassination attempt on Graziani. The general oversaw another wave of reprisals and had all Ethiopians in administrative jobs murdered, some by being thrown from aircraft, after being taken on board under the pretext of visiting the King in Rome, leading to the saying \"He went to Rome\".\n\nThe army of occupation had 150,000 men but was spread thinly; by 1941 the garrison had been increased to 250,000 soldiers, including 75,000 Italian civilians. The former police chief of Addis Ababa, Abebe Aregai, was the most successful leader of the Ethiopian guerrilla movement after 1937, using units of fifty men. On 11 December, the League of Nations voted to condemn Italy and Mussolini withdrew from the League. Along with world condemnation, the occupation was expensive, the budget for AOI from 1936 to 1937 required 19,136 billion lire for infrastructure, when the annual revenue of Italy was only 18,581 billion lire. In 1939 \"Ras\" Sejum Mangascià, \"Ras\" Ghetacciù Abaté and \"Ras\" Kebbedé Guebret submitted to the Italian Empire and guerilla warfare petered out. In early 1940, the last area of guerilla activity was around lake Tana and the southern Gojjam, under the leadership of the degiac Mangascià Giamberè and Belay Zelleke.\n\nWhile in exile in England, Haile Selassie had sought the support of the Western democracies for his cause but had little success until the Second World War began. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on France and Britain and attacked British and Commonwealth forces in Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and British Somaliland. In August 1940, the Italian conquest of British Somaliland was completed. The British and Selassie incited Ethiopian and other local forces to join a campaign to dislodge the Italians from Ethiopia. Selassie went to Khartoum to establish closer liaison with the British and resistance forces within Ethiopia. On 18 January 1941, Selassie crossed the border into Ethiopia near the village of Um Iddla and two days later rendezvoused with Gideon Force. on 5 May, Selassie and an army of Ethiopian Free Forces entered Addis Ababa. After the Italian defeat, the Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia was carried out by remnants of Italian troops and their allies, which lasted until the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces in September 1943.\n\nThe treaty signed in Paris by the Italian Republic (\"Repubblica Italiana\") and the victorious powers of World War II on 10 February 1947, included formal Italian recognition of Ethiopian independence and an agreement to pay $25,000,000 in reparations. Since the League of Nations and most of its members had never officially recognized Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia, Haile Selassie had been recognized as the restored emperor of Ethiopia following his formal entry into Addis Ababa in May 1941. Ethiopia presented a bill to the Economic Commission for Italy of £184,746,023 for damages inflicted during the course of the Italian occupation. The list included the destruction of the slaughter or theft of and goats, and mules and \n\nBooks\n\nJournals\n\nBooks\n\nTheses\n\n"}

It is located in the Yemeni Highlands, near the port city of Mocha on the Red Sea, lying at an elevation of about above sea level. It is the capital of Taiz Governorate. With a population of over 600,000 in 2005, it is the third largest city in Yemen after the capital Sana'a and the southern port city of Aden. Taiz is considered to be the cultural capital of Yemen.\n\nIn 130 CE the Jewish quarter was established in the city.\nOne of the famous and most accepted traveler in Taiz was Ibn Battuta. In his travels he describes this city as \"one of the most beautiful and extensive cities of Yemen.\" Ibn was invited to a banquet with the king and received a warm and inviting welcome. \n\nTaiz was ruled by Turan-Shah, the older brother of Saladin, after he had conquered Yemen in 1173 CE. Turan-Shah built the citadel on the hill overlooking the old city. In 1175 CE, Taiz was made the capital of Yemen as it was incorporated into dominions of the Ayyubid dynasty by Turan-Shah.\n\nThe second Rasulid King, Almaddhafar (1288 CE), established Taiz as the second capital of the Rasulid Dynasty after Zabid. In 1332 Ibn Battutah visited Taiz and described it as one of the largest and most beautiful cities of Yemen.\n\nIn the 1500, the capital is moved to Sana'a by the ruler of the Taharid dynasty. In 1516 Taiz comes under Ottoman control.\n\nIn 1918 the Ottomans lost Taiz to the new independent Yemen.\n\nTaiz remained a walled city until 1948 when Imam Ahmed made it the second capital of Yemen, allowing for expansion beyond its fortified wall.\n\nIn the 1960s, the first purified water system in Yemen is opened in Taiz. In 1962, state administrations move back to Sana'a.\n\nDuring the Yemeni Revolution fighting in Taiz resulted in anti-government forces seizing control of the city from president Ali Abdullah Saleh.\n\nAs part of the 2015 Yemeni Civil War, on 22 March 2015, the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh took the city in the aftermath of their coup d'état in Sana'a. Then the city endured a military confrontation between Houthis and the forces loyal to Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. The city was effectively under siege and the United Nations warned of an \"extreme and irreversible\" food shortage if fighting continued. In August 2015 Yemeni MP Muhammad Muqbil Al-Himyari reported Houthi attacks on civilians in Taiz and appealed for help on Suhail TV (Yemen).\n\nTaiz has a Humid subtropical climate. The average daily temperature high during August is . Annual rainfall of Taiz is around , but on Jabal Sabir it is probably around per year.\n\nThe city has many old and beautiful quarters, with houses that are typically built with brown bricks, and mosques are usually white. Most famous among the mosques are the Ashrafiya, the Muctabiya and the Mudhaffar. Also memorable are the old citadel and the governor's palace that rests on top of a mountain spur 450 metres above the city centre. It also has one of the most famous mountains in Yemen, the Saber mountain (almost 3000 meters above sea level), which affords panoramic views over the city. The city has a Muslim madrasa that has university status.\n\nHistorically, the mountainous city of Taiz was known for coffee production. The coffee produced in Taiz was considered some of the finest in the region in the early 20th century. Today, coffee remains a major part of the economy but mango, pomegranate, citrus banana, papai, vegetables, cereals, onions, and qat are also grown in the surrounding landscape. Cheese from Taiz is also renowned throughout Yemen.\n\nIndustries in the city of Taiz include cotton-weaving, tanning and jewelry production. Taiz today is the largest industrial base in Yemen.\n\nTaiz has many road connections with the rest of the country. The city is served by Ta'izz International Airport.\n"}

Tsiang, was a historian and diplomat of the Republic of China.\n\nTsiang was born in Shaoyang in Hunan Province. Tsiang's education from his teenage years had been Western and largely Christian, and he converted to Christianity at the age of 11. Having been urged to study in the U.S. by his teacher from a missionary school, in 1911, he was sent to study in the United States, where he attended the Park Academy, Oberlin College and Columbia University. His dissertation, \"Labor and Empire: A Study of the Reaction of British Labor, Mainly as Represented in Parliament, to British Imperialism Since 1880,\" led him into issues in the relation of foreign relations and domestic politics which would structure his scholarship after he returned to China. After obtaining a Ph.D., he returned to China in 1923, where he first took up a position at Nankai University and then at Tsinghua University.\nAt Tsinghua, Tsiang became the head of the History Department, where he edited and published a number of works on Chinese history and edited the English-language journal \"Chinese Social and Political Science Review\". Using newly opened Qing dynasty archives and diplomatic publications, Tsiang argued that China should adopt Western approaches if it wanted to score diplomatic victories. Tsiang blamed China's unequal treatment by Western powers after the First Opium War (1839–42) on the Chinese unequal treatment of Western powers before the war. During his tenure at Tsinghua, he mentored a number of historians in the study of Qing history, including John K. Fairbank.\nFollowing mounting tensions in China's relations with Japan, Tsiang left academia in 1935 and joined the Chinese Nationalist government, which he served in many different capacities throughout the Sino-Japanese War. In 1945, Tsiang became the Permanent Representative of China to the United Nations, and he subsequently also served as the ambassador of China to the United States. Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China on the Chinese mainland, Tsiang defended the exclusive right of the Taipei-based Republic of China to represent China in the United Nations and in the Security Council. He died of cancer in New York City on 9 October 1965, aged 69.\n\n\n"}

A rotative engine is a type of beam engine where the reciprocating motion of the beam is converted to rotary motion, producing a continuous power source suitable for driving machinery.\n\nThis engine was designed by the mechanical engineer James Watt, manufactured for the firm Boulton and Watt and originally installed in the Whitbread brewery in London, England. On decommissioning in 1887 it was sent to Australia's Powerhouse Museum (then known as the Technological, Industrial and Sanitary Museum) and has since been restored to full working order.\n\nThe engine was ordered by Samuel Whitbread in 1784 to replace a horse wheel at the Chiswell Street premises of his London brewery. It was installed in 1785, the second steam engine to be installed in a brewery, and enabled Whitbread to become the largest brewer in Britain. The horse wheel was retained for many years, serving as a backup in case the steam engine broke down.\nThe drive gear of the engine, still evident today, was connected to a series of wooden line shafts which drove machinery within the brewery. Connected machinery included rollers to crush malt; an Archimedes' screw, that lifted the crushed malt into a hopper; a hoist, for lifting items into the building; a three-piston pump, for pumping beer; and a stirrer within a vat. There was also a reciprocating pump connected to the engine's beam, used to pump water from a well to a tank on the roof of the brewery.\n\nIn a marketing coup for both the brewer and the engine's manufacturer, King George III and Queen Charlotte visited the brewery on 24 May 1787. The engine remained in service for 102 years, until 1887.\n\nThe engine made its way to the Powerhouse Museum (then known as the Technological, Industrial and Sanitary Museum) through Archibald Liversidge, an English-born chemist, scientist and academic at the University of Sydney, who was a trustee of the museum. Liversidge was in London in 1887, at the time of the engine's decommissioning, and when he heard that the engine was to be scrapped he asked whether it could be donated to the museum. Whitbread & Co agreed on condition that the engine be set up and used for educational purposes.\n\nSubsequently, the engine was dismantled and shipped to Sydney on the sailing ship \"Patriarch\". For shipping purposes, the large flywheel was divided into two halves. While the flywheel's rim could be unbolted, the hub with attached spokes had to be drilled through and rejoined after shipping. A shortage of funds meant the engine was kept in storage for several years. Eventually the engine was erected in its own engine house, behind the main building at the museum's old Harris Street premises. During the 1920s or 1930s, an electric motor was added so that people could see the engine in motion. During the 1980s the Technology Restoration Society was formed in order to raise funds for the engine's restoration. Restoration took place at the Museum's Castle Hill site. During the restoration, some parts – including the piston – were replaced to preserve the original parts. The engine, restored to steaming condition, was installed in the new Powerhouse Museum in 1988. Today the engine is sometimes operated as part of the Museum's Steam Revolution exhibition, steam being provided by the Museum's central boiler.\n\nThe engine has a diameter piston with a long stroke, driven by a mean effective pressure of . Its top speed is 20 revolutions per minute (rpm) of the flywheel. In the engine's youth, it had a maximum power output of approximately . It underwent a series of alterations in 1795, converting it from single-acting to double-acting; it was alleged at the time that this conversion improved its power to , but the Powerhouse Museum claims this is false. A centrifugal governor, which moderates the level of steam provided if the engine begins to overload was added some years after this, and beam and main driving rod, both originally of wood, were replaced in sand-cast iron.\n\nApart from its age, the engine is notable in that it embodies the four innovations which made Boulton & Watt's engines a significant driver of the Industrial Revolution. The first is a separate condenser, which increases the efficiency of the engine by allowing the main cylinder to remain hot at all times. The second is the parallel motion, which converts the up-and-down motion of the piston into the arcing motion of the beam, whilst maintaining a rigid connection. The rigid connection allowed the engine to be double-acting, meaning the piston could push as well as pull the beam. Third is the centrifugal governor, used to automatically regulate the speed of the engine. Finally the sun and planet gear convert the reciprocating motion of the beam into a rotating motion, which can be used to drive rotating machinery.\n\nThe engine is featured on the Bank of England £50 note along with Matthew Boulton, James Watt, and the Soho Manufactory. \n\n\n"}

Data picked up by the sensors undergoes \"data fusion\", which converts the information into easily interpreted forms; this data fusion is the most important aspect of the system . \n\nThe data fusion process occurs \"within\" the sensor network rather than at a centralized computer and is performed by a specially developed algorithm based on Bayesian statistics. WATS would not use a centralized computer for analysis because researchers found that factors such as latency and available bandwidth tended to create significant bottlenecks. Data processed in the field by the network itself (by transferring small amounts of data between neighboring sensors) is faster and makes the network more scalable . \n\nAn important factor in WATS development is \"ease of deployment\", since more sensors both improves the detection rate and reduces false alarms . WATS sensors could be deployed in permanent positions or mounted in vehicles for mobile protection of specific locations.\n\nOne barrier to the implementation of WATS is the size, weight, energy requirements and cost of currently available wireless sensors . The development of improved sensors is a major component of current research at the Nonproliferation, Arms Control, and International Security (NAI) Directorate at LLNL.\n\nWATS was profiled to the U.S. House of Representatives' Military Research and Development Subcommittee on October 1, 1997 during a hearing on nuclear terrorism and countermeasures . On August 4, 1998 in a subsequent meeting of that subcommittee, Chairman Curt Weldon stated that research funding for WATS had been cut by the Clinton administration to a subsistence level and that the program had been poorly re-organized .\n"}

Founded in 1851, it has had many notable members and played an important early role in the history of mycology in Britain.\n\nThe Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club was founded in 1851 \"for the practical study, in all its branches, of the Natural History of Herefordshire and the districts immediately adjacent\". The club was and still is based in the city of Hereford, but took its name from the Woolhope Dome, an outcrop of Silurian rocks around the village of Woolhope to the south-east of the city. The club's first field meeting was held in the Woolhope area.\n\nThe club's \"Transactions\" have been published regularly since 1856, and early issues suggest that the membership took an interest not only in geology, but in fossils, botany, meteorology, ichthyology, and entomology. In 1856, the botanist George Bentham (who lived at Pontrilas) was an honorary member, as were the geologists the Rev. Peter Bellinger Brodie, William Henry Fitton, Leonard Horner, Sir Charles Lyell, Sir Roderick Murchison, Prof. John Phillips, and the Rev. Prof. Adam Sedgwick, the botanist John Lindley, the naturalist Sir William Jardine, and the zoologist Prof. Robert E. Grant. The geologist the Rev. William Samuel Symonds was a founder member and president of the club in 1855.\n\nIn 1871, Sir James Rankin, a wealthy member of the club, offered to pay for a \"Public Library and Museum in connection with the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club\". This building, with natural history carvings and gargoyles on its frontage and a purpose-built meeting room for the club, was duly erected in Hereford in 1873. It remains the city's main public library, museum & art gallery and the club's headquarters.\n\nSince Herefordshire was and is renowned for its cider and perry, an early project of the club was to document and conserve local apple and pear cultivars. To this end, the club held annual exhibitions of local fruit, inviting leading pomologists to help identify samples collected or submitted from local orchards. Under the enthusiastic direction of founder and past president of the club, Dr Henry Graves Bull, two local artists, his daughter Edith Elizabeth Bull and Alice Blanche Ellis, were engaged to paint watercolours of the fruit, whilst an honorary member, Dr Robert Hogg, vice-president of the Royal Horticultural Society, wrote text to accompany the paintings. The result was the \"Herefordshire Pomona\", a major publication for the club, issued in parts between 1878 and 1884, with over 400 paintings reproduced as hand-coloured lithographs.\n\nThe \"Herefordshire Pomona\" was an expensive work – and is now even more so, a copy being offered for $19,500 in 2009. Since the club wished the book to be of practical use, a revised but inexpensive version of the text, called \"The Apple and Pear as Vintage Fruits\", was published in 1886. The \"Pomona\" itself is now available on CD.\n\nDr Henry Graves Bull also had an enthusiasm for fungi and in 1867 read a paper at a club meeting on some local, edible species. This seems to have stimulated the interest of the club and in 1868, the October field meeting – announced as \"a foray among the funguses\" – was devoted to collecting fungi. The foray, led by the noted mycologist Worthington G. Smith and local expert Edwin Lees, was followed by a special fungus dinner. The event proved popular and the \"foray\" was repeated annually till 1892.\n\nThese Woolhope fungus events became so well known that the word \"foray\" was widely adopted for mycological field meetings and remains the standard term today, not only in Britain but in North America and elsewhere. For a time, the club functioned as a precursor to the British Mycological Society, bringing together a number of contemporary British mycologists, many of whom attended the forays and contributed papers to the \"Transactions\". By 1882, honorary members included the mycologists Rev. Miles Joseph Berkeley, C. E. Broome, Mordecai Cubitt Cooke, William Phillips, C. B. Plowright, Worthington G. Smith, and Rev. J. E. Vize. Ordinary members included Rev. W. L. W. Eyre.\n\nAn attendee at the 1891 fungus foray was Alfred Watkins, subsequently to become a president of the club. Watkins was a keen photographer and archaeologist. In June 1921, whilst mapping old sites near Blackwardine, Watkins noticed some surprising alignments which suggested to him a series of prehistoric trackways marked by ancient landmarks some of which were still visible. Later that year, he delivered a talk to the club on \"Early British Trackways\" and after further researches published his thesis and his findings in \"The Old Straight Track\" (1925). His book was not well received by academics, but Watkins' theory of ley lines gained followers and a resurgence of interest in the 1970s, when it acquired a mystic dimension which would have surprised Watkins himself.\n\nThe Woolhope Club still organises a series of field meetings each year, with special interest groups for archaeological research, geology, and natural history. To mark the 150th anniversary of the club a book, \"A Herefordshire Miscellany\", was published in 2000.\n\n"}

She worked as a battlefield surgeon for the People's Army of Vietnam and Vietcong during the Vietnam War. At age 27, she and another colleague were killed by a patrol from the US 4th Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment in a Free-fire zone while traveling on a trail in the \"Ba Tơ\" jungle in Quảng Ngãi Province. Her wartime diaries, which chronicle the last two years of her life, attracted international attention following their publication in 2005.\n\nOne of Trâm's handwritten diaries was captured by US forces in December 1969. Following her death in a gun battle on June 22, 1970, a second diary was taken by Frederic (Fred) Whitehurst, a then 22-year-old military intelligence specialist. Whitehurst defied an order to burn the diaries, instead following the advice of a South Vietnamese translator not to destroy them. He kept them for 35 years, with the intention of eventually returning them to Trâm's family.\n\nAfter returning to the United States, Whitehurst's search for Trâm's family initially proved unsuccessful. After earning a Ph.D. in chemistry he joined the FBI, but was unable to reach anyone from the Vietnamese embassy. In March 2005, he and his brother Robert - another Vietnam veteran - brought the diaries to a conference at Texas Tech University. There, they met photographer Ted Engelmann (also a Vietnam veteran), who offered to look for the family during his trip to Vietnam. With the assistance of Do Xuan Anh, a staff member in the Hanoi Quaker office, Engelmann was able to locate Trâm's mother, Doan Ngoc Tram, and subsequently reached the rest of her family.\n\nIn July 2005, Trâm's diaries were published in Vietnam under the title \"Nhật ký Đặng Thùy Trâm\" (\"Đặng Thùy Trâm's Diary\" (\"Last Night I Dreamed Of Peace\")), which quickly became a bestseller. In less than a year, the volume sold more than 300,000 copies and comparisons were drawn between Trâm's writings and that of Anne Frank.\n\nIn August 2005, Fred and Robert Whitehurst traveled to Hanoi to meet Trâm's family. In October of that year, Trâm's family visited Lubbock, Texas to view the diaries archived at Texas Tech University Vietnam Archive, and then visited Fred Whitehurst and his family.\n\nThe diaries were translated into English and published in September 2007. They include family photographs and images of Trâm. Translations of the diaries have been published in at least sixteen different languages.\n\nIn 2009, a film about Tram by Vietnamese director Đặng Nhật Minh, entitled \"Đừng Đốt\" (\"Do Not Burn It\"), was released.\n\n\n"}
