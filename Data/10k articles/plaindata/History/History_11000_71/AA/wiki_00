He is now best known for his photographs of Notting Hill during the period of West Indian migration to London; however, his subject matter has also included film stars and student protests, with his photographs having appeared in \"Stern\", \"Harper’s Bazaar\", \"Life\" and \"Vogue\" and in Italian and Swiss journals. His work has been exhibited at galleries including Tate Britain, Museum of London, Nottingham New Art Exchange, Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit and Museum of the City of New York, and is also in collections at The Wedge, London's Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A), as well as the Tate. Phillips has been called: \"Arguably the most important (yet least lauded) black British photographer of his generation\", and a January 2015 feature in \"Time Out London\" referred to him as \"the greatest London photographer you've never heard of — and some of his best works are only just being discovered\".\n\nBorn in Kingston, Jamaica, Phillips spent his early childhood with his grandparents in St Mary after his parents had migrated to Britain. He developed an early interest in naval matters: \"We used to wait for the tour ships to come in and we used to try and sell them something or try and escort them somewhere or show them around Kingston harbour. At that time Kingston was a main shipping port in the Caribbean... Every afternoon after school I used to go down to the pier and watch different ships coming in. It was the era of big immigration to England.\" At the age of 11, Phillips too made the journey from Jamaica to England, sailing on the \"Reina del Pacifico\", a Pacific Steam Navigation Company passenger ship: \"This was a one of my most memorable experiences... We visited different ports... We visited Cuba, Bermuda, and I saw Santander in Spain and we ended up in Plymouth. Ever since then I've had a fascination for ships and docks and the sea.\" \n\nHe joined his parents in London, on 17 August 1956, and the family lived among other West Indian immigrants in Notting Hill, at the time a poor area of the capital characterised by Rachmanism and racism. Phillips recalls: \"I was an altar boy at a church called St Michael when Kelso Cochrane was buried [on 6 June 1959] – one of the biggest funerals in Notting Hill at the time. It was just after the race riots and because my parents thought there would be trouble that's the only day I didn’t go to the procession. These were the days where for coloured people it wasn't safe to walk on the street, especially when Oswald Mosley was at his peak.\"\n\nPhillips worked in his parents' restaurant \"Las Palmas\" in Portobello Road. He began his photographic career by accident when, while still very young, he was given a Kodak Brownie by a black American serviceman. Phillips taught himself to use it (\"I bought a book from Boots on how to take photos and learnt from my mistakes\") and began to photograph life in Notting Hill, making his prints in the family bathroom after his parents had retired to bed.\n\nAfter joining the Merchant Navy for a while (serving as a galley boy and developing an interest in marine biology and maritime history), Phillips travelled widely in Europe, to Sweden, Switzerland, France and Italy. Caught up in the protest movements of the late 1960s, he took photographs of the student riots in Paris and Rome. He worked as a freelance photographer for magazines and he had his first exhibition in Milan in 1972, entitled \"Il Frustrazi\" and portraying the lives of urban migrant workers. He also took paparazzi-style pictures of celebrities including Omar Sharif, Gina Lollobrigida and Muhammad Ali.\n\nReturning to London after several years, Phillips lived \"a bohemian life of squats and pop festivals\". Described as \"A card carrying member of the 'sex, drugs and rock n roll era'\", he ended up a party where he took photographs of Jimi Hendrix but ironically could get no British news editor to publish them. Throughout the 1960s he documented aspects of urban life in Notting Hill and the shifts taking place in the cultural landscape, including racial integration and the birth of Carnival.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Phillips regularly took photographs that document West Indian funerals, at Kensal Green Cemetery and elsewhere, which have been collected together under the title \"How Great Thou Art: 50 Years of Afro-Caribbean Funerals\". In 1988 he moved to south London and opened a diner in Wandsworth, Smokey Joe’s, that often featured in restaurant guides, running it for 11 years, while building up a collection of shipping memorabilia but not pursuing his career as a photographer, demoralised by not being able to get his work published.\n\nA revival of interest in the work of Charlie Phillips came with it being featured in an exhibition at the Tabernacle, Notting Hill, in 1991, coinciding with the launch of his book of photographs \"Notting Hill In the Sixties\". Introduced by writer Mike Phillips (no relation), the book includes photographs of everyday life in the area, covering poor housing conditions, musical entertainment and political activism.\n\nCurator Paul Goodwin, speaking of the work in the 2013 exhibition \"Charlie Phillips: The Urban Eye\" (a 2014 Deutsche Börse Photography Prize nomination), compared Phillips' significance to that of documentary photographers such as Markéta Luskačová, Shirley Baker and Tom Wood, saying: \"Each photograph tells ‘other’ stories...about the rise of modern multicultural London and the migrant experience in the city.\" Reviewing the exhibition in the \"Nottingham Post\", Mark Patterson called it \"a reminder of a London and an England that has almost been wiped out of existence by redevelopment; a country where the business-driven 'regeneration' imperative has squeezed out authenticity and local texture. And for London, read Nottingham and many other towns and cities.\"\n\nPhillips' most recent show, \"How Great Thou Art: 50 Years of African Caribbean Funerals in London\", opened in November 2014 at Photofusion Gallery in Brixton, curated by Eddie Otchere and Lizzy King, with support from Arts Council England's Grants for the Arts Fund. \n\n\"Hungry Eye\" magazine stated: \"Photographer Charlie Phillips presents a sensitive photographic documentary of the social and emotional traditions that surround death in London’s African Caribbean community. How Great Thou Art represents a lifetime’s work by Charlie.\" The reviewer for \"The Root\" praised the exhibition as \"a collection of beautifully evocative, powerfully elegiac images\", describing Phillips as \"a rare breed who combines the adventurous, pioneering spirit and perennial resilience of the hardy immigrant (he came to Britain in the 1950s) with the sensitive eye of the aesthete and a longing to transmute the banal, the prosaic and the unpalatable in ordinary existence into a thing of ineffable beauty.\"\n\nAccompanying the publication of a limited-edition book of the same title (successfully funded by Kickstarter), \"How Great Thou Art\" has been called \"a new landmark in British photography. The question of life and death and the cultural responses to death through funerals in the Caribbean community has featured sporadically in various photographic oeuvres before but no one has explored this subject in such depth and in such a participatory and embedded manner as evidenced by Charlie Phillips.\" In \"The Spectator\", Ian Thomson wrote: \"In Phillips’s moving and often beautiful images, dating from 1962 to the present, the bereaved are seen to face the mystery of the end of life in stush black suits, spidery hat veils, Rastafari head-ties, spiffy trilbies and strictly-come-dancehall white socks... Anyone feeling a bit like death in the run-up to Christmas should invest in a copy of \"How Great Thou Art\" — and feel revivified.\"\n\nPhillips is featured in the art installation by Peter Dunn commissioned by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea on the Portobello Road north wall, in a series of photomurals celebrating key personalities, history and events of the Golborne and Portobello area over the past hundred years.\n\nOn 17 June 2017, Phillips was guest curator at Black Cultural Archives for the day, to celebrate the forthcoming launch of the Charlie Phillips Roots Archive.\n\n\nPhillips' 1967 photo \"Notting Hill Couple\" appears on the cover of the CD \"London Is the Place for Me Vol. 2: Calypso Kwela Highlife and Jazz from Young Black London\" (Honest Jon's Records). It also featured in \"Staying Power: Photographs of Black British Experience, 1950-1990s\", a collaborative exhibition by Black Cultural Archives and the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), and in the National Portrait Gallery's 2015 exhibition \"Face of Britain.\" In March 2016 the photograph was selected by \"Time Out\" as one of \"The 40 best photos of London ever taken\", and was described by the magazine as \"a picture that speaks volumes about London living and loving\".\n\nPublications in which his photographs are reproduced include \"Carnival: A Photographic and Testimonial History of the Notting Hill Carnival\" (Rice N Peas Books, 2014), which followed from a 2011 exhibition of Notting Hill Carnival photographs curated by Ishmahil Blagrove that featured work by Phillips among others at The Tabernacle.\n\nThe exhibition \"Charlie Phillips: The Urban Eye\", curated by Paul Goodwin at New Art Exchange, Nottingham, was longlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize 2014.\n\nSimon Schama, in an extract published in \"The Guardian\" from his book \"The Face of Britain\", which features images from the National Portrait Gallery's collection, describes Phillips as \"a visual poet; chronicler, champion, witness of a gone world ... one of Britain's great photo-portraitists\", reproducing \"Notting Hill Couple\" alongside the article.\n\n\"Rootical\", a film by Nike Hatzidimon about Phillips' life, won the Best First Film Award at the Portobello Film Festival in 2006.\n\nPhillips' life and work was covered in \"Neighbourhood Tales: Black And White\", broadcast in October 2003, in Channel Four's \"Neighbourhood Tales\" slot.\n\n\nA website featuring an online archive of Phillips' photographs, curated by Eddie Otchere and with National Lottery funding, was launched in January 2018 as part of the Charlie Phillips Heritage Archive project.\n\n"}

{"id": "44565920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44565920", "title": "Communist insurgency in Thailand", "text": "Communist insurgency in Thailand\n\nThe Communist insurgency in Thailand was a guerrilla war lasting from 1965 until 1983, fought mainly by the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) and the government of Thailand. The war declined in 1980 following the declaration of an amnesty and by 1983 the CPT had abandoned the insurgency.\n\nIn 1927, Chinese communist Han Minghuang attempted to create a communist organization in Bangkok before being arrested. Ho Chi Minh visited north Thailand the following year, attempting to organize soviets in local Vietnamese communities. In the aftermath of the Siamese revolution of 1932, conservative Prime Minister Phraya Manopakorn accused his political opponent, Pridi Panomyong, of being a communist and shortly afterwards a law was passed criminalising communism.\n\nDuring World War II communists formed an alliance with the Free Thai Movement. In 1946, Pridi Panomyong assumed office, repealing the Anti-Communist Act of 1933 and establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. In 1960, North Vietnam created a training camp for Thai and Laotian volunteers in Hoa Binh Province, Vietnam. A total of 400 people attended the camp in its first year of operation.\n\nIn 1949, Pridi Phanomyong's attempt to return to power after the 1947 coup d'état was crushed. The suppression of the \"palace rebellion\" convinced the CPT leadership that better preparations had to be made in order for a future rebellion to succeed.\n\nThe failure of the 1952 Peace Rebellion was followed by the 13 November 1952 Anti-Communist Act. The act was sparked by the spontaneous involvement of a small number of communist party members in the rebellion.\n\nDuring the course of the Korean War, the CPT continued to stockpile weaponry in rural areas and make general preparations for armed struggle. At the same time, the CPT formed the Peace Committee of Thailand, a pacifist movement operating mainly in urban areas. The Peace Committee contributed to CPT's expansion and the rise of anti-American sentiment in the country.\n\nIdeologically, the CPT aligned with Maoism and during the Sino-Soviet split the party sided with the Communist Party of China. In October 1964, the organization declared its position in a congratulatory message on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the foundation of the People's Republic of China, and the following month a group of Thai communists formed the Thailand Independence Movement in Peking, China.\n\nOn 8 December 1964, the Thailand Independence Movement issued a manifesto demanding the removal of US military personnel from Thailand and calling for regime change. The manifesto was later also broadcast by Radio Peking. Former Thai army officer Phayon Chulanont established the Thai Patriotic Front, another Thai communist organization, on 1 January 1965. The two parties formed the Thai United Patriotic Front on 15 December 1966. Hill tribesmen, as well as the Chinese and Vietnamese ethnic minorities, formed the backbone of the movement.\n\nIn the early-1950s, a group of 50 Thai communists traveled to Beijing, where they received training in ideology and propaganda. In 1961, small groups of Pathet Lao insurgents infiltrated north Thailand. Local communist party cells were organized and volunteers were sent to Chinese, Laotian, and North Vietnamese training camps, where training focused on armed struggle and terror tactics to fight capitalism in the region. Between 1962 and 1965, 350 Thai nationals underwent an eight-month training course in North Vietnam. The guerrillas initially possessed only limited a limited number of flintlocks as well as French, Chinese, and Japanese weapons. In the first half of 1965, the rebels smuggled approximately 3,000 US-made weapons and 90,000 rounds of ammunition from Laos. The shipment, originally supplied to the US-supported Royal Lao Armed Forces, was instead sold to smugglers who in turn traded the weapons to the CPT.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1965, insurgents carried out 17 political assassinations. They avoided full scale guerrilla warfare until the summer of 1965, when militants began engaging Thai security forces. A total of 13 clashes were recorded during that period. The second half of 1965 was marked by a further 25 violent incidents, and starting in November 1965, Communist Party of Thailand insurgents began undertaking more elaborate operations, including an ambush on a Thai police patrol outside Mukdahan, at that time in Nakhon Phanom Province.\n\nThe insurgency spread to other parts of Thailand in 1966, although 90 percent of insurgency-related incidents occurred in the northeast of the country. On 14 January 1966, a spokesman representing the Thai Patriotic Front called for the start of a \"people's war\" in Thailand. The statement marked an escalation of violence in the conflict, and in early April 1966 rebels killed 16 Thai soldiers and wounded 13 others during clashes in Chiang Rai Province. A total of 45 security personnel and 65 civilians were killed by insurgent attacks during the first half of 1966.\n\nDespite insurgent attacks on the 24,470 United States Air Force personnel housed on bases in Thailand, American involvement in the conflict remained limited.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the National Revolutionary Army in the Chinese Civil War, its 49th Division crossed into Thailand from neighboring Yunnan. The Chinese troops quickly integrated into Thai society, engaging in the lucrative opium trade under the aegis of corrupt officials. Drug trade provided an important source of income for the local population, while at the same time nationalist troops cooperated with the government during its counter-insurgency operations. In July 1967, the 1967 Opium War broke out when opium growers refused to pay taxes to the Kuomintang. Government forces became involved in the conflict, destroying a number of villages and resettling suspected communists. The newly transferred populations provided new recruits for the CPT.\n\nIn February and August 1967, the Thai government conducted a number of counter-insurgency raids in Bangkok and Thonburi, arresting 30 CPT members including secretary-general Thong Chaemsri. Further arrests ensued in October and November 1968.\n\nThe Thai government deployed over 12,000 troops to the country's northern provinces in January 1972, carrying out a six-week operation in which over 200 militants were killed. The government's casualties during the operation amounted to 30 soldiers killed and 100 wounded.\n\nIn late-1972, the Royal Thai Army, police, and volunteer defence forces commit the Red Drum killings of more than 200 (informal accounts speak of up to 3,000) civilians who were accused of supporting communists in Tambon Lam Sai, Phatthalung Province, southern Thailand. The massacre was probably ordered by the government's Communist Suppression Operations Command (CSOC).\n\nIt was only one example \"of a pattern of widespread abuse of power by the army and enforcement agencies\" during the brutal anti-communist operations of 1971–1973 that took an official death toll of 3,008 civilians throughout the country (while unofficial estimates are between 1,000 and 3,000 in Phatthalung Province alone). Those killed were accused of working with the Communist Party of Thailand.\nUntil that point, communist suspects arrested by soldiers were normally shot by the roadside. The \"red oil drum\" technique was later introduced to eliminate any possible evidence. Suspects were clubbed to a point of semi-consciousness before being dumped in gasoline-filled, used oil drums and burnt alive. The 200 litre red drums had an iron grille divider with a fire below, and the suspect above.\n\nOn 6 October 1976, amid rising fears of a communist takeover similar to the one that had taken place in Vietnam, anti-communist police and paramilitaries attacked a leftist student demonstration at Thammasat University in Bangkok, during an incident that became known as the Thammasat University massacre. According to official estimates, 46 students were killed and 167 wounded.\n\nFrom 1979, amid the rise of Thai nationalism and the deterioration of China–Vietnam relations, the CPT fell into serious turmoil. The pro-Vietnamese wing had eventually seceded and formed a separated faction called \"Pak Mai\".\n\nEfforts to end the insurgency led to an amnesty being declared on 23 April 1980 when Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda signed Order 66/2523. The order significantly contributed to the decline of the insurgency, as it granted amnesty to defectors and promoted political participation and democratic processes. By 1983, the insurgency had come to an end.\n\n"}

In order to protect data from unauthorized retrieval, many users implement a password, either on the bootloader or the operating system of their devices. However, somebody with physical access to the device can compromise the firmware on the system and have it log keystrokes. Thus, when the victim returns to their device and inputs a password, the compromised firmware remotely sends the password to the attacker, and the attacker can access the data on the device when it is once again unattended.\n\nDue to the number of vulnerable devices (any unattended device) and ineffective security systems intended to prevent unauthorized access to the device, several detection and prevention methods have been created in order to mitigate the threat of an evil maid attack.\n\nA 2009 blog post titled \"Evil Maid goes after TrueCrypt!\" by Joanna Rutkowska, a security analyst, details a method for compromising the firmware on an unattended computer with TrueCrypt disk encryption via an external USB flash drive. She coined the term \"Evil Maid Attack\" due to hotel rooms being a common place where devices are left unattended.\n\nD. Defreez, a computer security professional, first mentioned the possibility of an evil maid attack on Android smartphones in 2011. He talked about the WhisperCore Android distribution and its ability to provide disk encryption for Androids.\n\nIn 2007, former U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez was allegedly targeted by an evil maid attack during a business trip to China. He left his computer unattended during a trade talk in Beijing, and he suspected that his device had been compromised. Although the allegations have yet to be confirmed or denied, the incident caused the U.S. government to be more wary of physical attacks.\n\nIn 2009, Symantec CTO Mark Bregman was advised by several U.S. agencies to leave his devices in the U.S. before travelling to China. He was instructed to buy new ones before leaving and dispose of them when he returned so that any physical attempts to retrieve data would be ineffective.\n\nIn 2017, former CIA employee Edward Snowden created an app called \"Haven\" to detect an evil maid attack.\n\nThe attack begins when the victim leaves their device unattended. The attacker can then proceed to tamper with the system. If the victim does not have password protection or authentication on their computer, an intruder can turn on the computer and immediately access the victim's information. However, if the device is password protected, as with full disk encryption, the firmware of the device needs to be compromised, usually done with an external drive. The compromised firmware often provides the victim with a fake password prompt identical to the original. Once the password is input, the compromised firmware sends the password to the attacker and removes itself after a reboot. In order to successfully complete the attack, the attacker must return to the device once it has been unattended a second time to steal the now-accessible data. \n\nAnother method of attack is through a DMA attack in which an attacker accesses the victim's information through hardware devices that connect directly to the physical address space. The attacker simply needs to connect to the hardware device in order to access the information.\n\nAn evil maid attack can also be done by replacing the victim's device with an identical device. If the original device has a bootloader password, then the attacker only needs to acquire a device with an identical bootloader password input screen. If the device has a lock screen, however, the process becomes more difficult as the attacker must acquire the background picture to put on the lock screen of the mimicking device. In either case, when the victim inputs their password on the false device, the device sends the password to the attacker, who is in possession of the original device. The attacker can then access the victim's data.\n\nLegacy BIOS is considered insecure against evil maid attacks. Its architecture is old, updates and Option ROMs are unsigned, and configuration is unprotected. Additionally, it does not support secure boot. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to boot from an external drive and compromise the firmware. The compromised firmware can then be configured to send keystrokes to the attacker remotely.\n\nUnified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) provides many necessary features for mitigating evil maid attacks. For example, it offers a framework for secure boot, authenticated variables at boot-time, and TPM initialization security. Despite these available security measures, platform manufacturers are not obligated to use them. Thus, security issues may arise when these unused features allow an attacker to exploit the device.\n\nMany full disk encryption systems, such as TrueCrypt and PGP Whole Disk Encryption, are susceptible to evil maid attacks due to their inability to authenticate themselves to the user. An attacker can still modify disk contents despite the device being powered off and encrypted. The attacker can modify the encryption system's loader codes to steal passwords from the victim.\n\nAny unattended device can be vulnerable to a network evil maid attack. If the attacker knows the victim's device well enough, they can replace the victim's device with an identical model with a password-stealing mechanism. Thus, when the victim inputs their password, the attacker will instantly be notified of it and be able to access the stolen device's information.\n\nDetection of an evil maid attack relies on the ability of the victim to know if the attacker is close to the unattended device.\n\nMany tools, such as proximity alarms, motion detector alarms, and wireless cameras, alert the victim when an attacker is nearby their device, thereby nullifying the surprise factor of an evil maid attack. Additionally, a low-cost solution can be to put glitter over the screw holes on the device so that the victim can know if the device has been taken apart. After an attack has been suspected, the victim can have their device checked to see if any malware was installed.\n\nPrevention of an evil maid attack relies not only on securing the firmware and hardware of the device but also ensuring the device is not left unattended.\n\nBasic security measures such as having the latest up-to-date firmware and shutting down the device before leaving it unattended prevent an attack from exploiting vulnerabilities in legacy architecture and allowing external devices into open ports, respectively. CPU-based disk encryption systems, such as TRESOR and Loop-Amnesia, prevent data from being vulnerable to a DMA attack by ensuring it does not leak into system memory. Furthermore, TPM-based secure boot has been shown to mitigate evil maid attacks by authenticating the device to the user. It does this by unlocking itself only if the correct password is given by the user and if it measures that no unauthorized code has been executed on the device. These measurements are done by root of trust systems, such as Microsoft's BitLocker and Intel's TXT technology. The Anti Evil Maid program builds upon TPM-based secure boot and further attempts to authenticate the device to the user.\n\nAdditionally, physical security must be ensured. If the device is under surveillance at all times, an attacker cannot perform an evil maid attack. The device can also be placed inside a lockbox so that an attacker will not have physical access to it.\n"}

He took office after receiving the largest number of votes in the 2016 election, 71,356 (39.1%). A historian, he was a docent at the University of Iceland until his election. His field of research is modern Icelandic history, and he has published a number of works on the Cod Wars, the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis and the Icelandic presidency, among other topics.\n\nGuðni is the son of teacher and journalist Margrét Thorlacius and sports instructor Jóhannes Sæmundsson. His brother Patrekur Jóhannesson is a former Icelandic handball national team player. Guðni played handball during his youth (both in Iceland and the UK).\n\nGuðni graduated from Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík in 1987 and earned a bachelor's degree in history and political science from the University of Warwick in England in 1991 and a Master of Arts in history from the University of Iceland in 1997. He has also studied German and Russian at university level. In 1999, he completed an MSt degree in history from St Antony's College, at the University of Oxford. In 2003, he received a PhD in history from Queen Mary, University of London.\n\nGuðni has worked as a lecturer at the University of Iceland, Bifröst University and University of London. At the time of his presidential candidacy he worked as a senior lecturer in history at the University of Iceland. His field of research is modern Icelandic history in which he has published a number of works, including on the Cod Wars, 2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis and the Icelandic presidency. He has written a biography of Gunnar Thoroddsen and a book about the presidency of Kristján Eldjárn. Between 1992 and 1997, he also translated four works by American author Stephen King into Icelandic.\n\nGuðni decided to stand for president on 5 May 2016. His platform included support for a citizen initiative referendum provision in the Constitution. Early polls showed significant support, and following incumbent president Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson's decision to drop out of the race Guðni saw an increase in popularity reflected in various polls, which ranked him first with 67% to 69%, far ahead of other contenders. Guðni was elected on 25 June after receiving a plurality with 39.1% of the vote.\n\nGuðni was unaffiliated with any of Iceland's political parties. Describing himself, Guðni stated that he would be a \"less political president\" than his predecessor Olafur Ragnar Grimsson due to a lack of political partisanship. Guðni has emphasized the importance of unity for the small Nordic nation.\n\nGuðni took office as President of Iceland on 1 August 2016. At 48, Guðni became Iceland's youngest president. Roughly one month into his term, Guðni had approval ratings of 68.6% in an MMR survey, the highest approval rating that this pollster has measured for the Icelandic President since its establishment in 2011. Early into his term, Guðni had to oversee negotiations to form a government in Iceland in the wake of the 2016 parliamentary elections that took place on 29 October. These negotiations were difficult, as no pre-election coalition had a majority, and all possible majority coalitions had parties with highly divergent policy positions. In December 2016, Guðni had approval ratings of 97%. Such high approval ratings for Icelandic politicians are without precedent.\n\nGuðni attracted international attention in February 2017 when he jokingly vowed to ban pineapple as a pizza topping.\n\nGuðni stands outside organized religion, but was raised in the Catholic faith. He left the Catholic Church due to its delayed and muted response to reports of criminal abuses by priests. His credo is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \"human beings are born free, equal in dignity and rights. Humans are endowed with reason and conscience and should act in the spirit of brotherhood towards each other.\"\n\nGuðni is the son of the teacher and journalist Margrét Thorlacius and the physical education teacher and coach Jóhannes Sæmundsson. His father died of cancer at the age of 42. He has two brothers, Patrekur, a former Icelandic national handball team player, who is coach of the Austria national handball team, and Jóhannes, who is a systems analyst.\n\nGuðni married Canadian Eliza Jean Reid in 2004 and they have four children together. The couple, who met while both were studying in the United Kingdom, moved to Iceland in 2003. Reid became First Lady of Iceland when her husband was sworn into office. Guðni also has a daughter from a previous marriage.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday 29 November 2016, in the Icelandic newspaper Morgunblaðið, was published an article which revealed how Guðni is related to former US president Barack Obama. Every Icelander can trace themselves to the bishop of Hólar, Gottskálk grimmi Nikulásson, therefore Icelanders were able to see their own relation to Obama, though it is noted that the relation is abysmally small.\n\nThe chart was made and traced by an employee of ORG - Genealogy Services in Iceland which is run by Oddur F. Helgason, a well known genealogist in Iceland. \nMorgunblaðið on Tuesday 24 January 2017, also published an article stating that Guðni was related to Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States through their shared ancestry of Haakon V of Norway. As in the previous case, this was also according to genealogist Oddur F.

{"id": "423682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=423682", "title": "Hydraulic empire", "text": "Hydraulic empire\n\nA hydraulic empire (also known as a hydraulic despotism, or water monopoly empire) is a social or government structure which maintains power and control through exclusive control over access to water. It arises through the need for flood control and irrigation, which requires central coordination and a specialized bureaucracy.\n\nOften associated with these terms and concepts is the notion of a \"water dynasty\". This body is a political structure which is commonly characterized by a system of hierarchy and control often based on class or caste. Power, both over resources (food, water, energy) and a means of enforcement such as the military are vital for the maintenance of control.\n\nA developed hydraulic civilization maintains control over its population by means of controlling the supply of water. The term was coined by the German-American historian Karl August Wittfogel (1896–1988), in his book \"Oriental Despotism\" (1957). Wittfogel asserted that such \"hydraulic civilizations\"—although they were neither all located in the Orient nor characteristic of all Oriental societies—were essentially different from those of the Western world.\n\nMost of the first civilizations in history, such as Ancient Egypt, Ancient Somalia, Sri Lanka, Mesopotamia, China and Pre-Columbian Mexico and Peru, are believed to have been hydraulic empires. The Indus Valley civilization is often considered a hydraulic empire despite a lack of evidence of irrigation (as this evidence may have been lost in time due to flood damage). Most hydraulic empires existed in arid or desert regions, but imperial China also had some such characteristics, due to the exacting needs of rice cultivation.\n\nThe Ajuran Sultanate of the Horn of Africa was the only hydraulic empire in Africa. A hydraulic empire that rose in the 13th century AD, Ajuran monopolized the water resources of the Jubba and Shebelle Rivers. Through hydraulic engineering, it also constructed many of the limestone wells and cisterns of the state that are still operative and in use today. Its rulers developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th century.\n\nWittfogel argues that climate caused some parts of the world to develop higher levels of civilization than others. He is known for claiming that climate in the Orient led to despotic rule. This environmental determinism comes to bear when considering that in those societies where the most control was exhibited, this was commonly the case due to the central role of the resource in economic processes and its environmentally limited, or constrained nature. This made controlling supply and demand easier and allowed a more complete monopoly to be established, as well as preventing the use of alternative resources to compensate. However, Diamond points out that complex irrigation projects predated states in Madagascar, Mexico, China and Mesopotamia.\n\nThe typical hydraulic empire government, in Wittfogel's thesis, is extremely centralized, with no trace of an independent aristocracy – in contrast to the decentralized feudalism of medieval Europe. Though tribal societies had structures that were usually personal in nature, exercised by a patriarch over a tribal group related by various degrees of kinship, hydraulic hierarchies gave rise to the established permanent institution of impersonal government. Popular revolution in such a state was impossible: a dynasty might die out or be overthrown by force, but the new regime would differ very little from the old one. Hydraulic empires were only ever destroyed by foreign conquerors.\nWittfogel's ideas, when applied to China, have been harshly criticized by scholars such as Joseph Needham who argued essentially that Wittfogel was operating from ignorance of basic Chinese history. Needham argued that the Chinese government was not despotic, was not dominated by a priesthood, had lots of peasant rebellions, and that Wittfogel's perspective does not address the necessity and presence of bureaucracy in modern Western civilization. Robert L. Carneiro was also critical of Wittfogel's theory, writing in \"Science\" in August 1970: \"This theory has recently run into difficulties. Archeological evidence now makes it appear that in at least three of the areas that Wittfogel cites as exemplifying his \"hydraulic hypothesis\"—Mesopotamia, China, and Mexico—full-fledged states developed well before large-scale irrigation\". With regard to Mesopotamia, Carneiro cited Robert McCormick Adams, Jr., who had concluded: \"In short, there is nothing to suggest that the rise of dynastic authority in southern Mesopotamia was linked to the administrative requirements of a major canal system.\" On China, which Carneiro called \"the prototypical area for Wittfogel's hydraulic theories\", he quoted Jacques Gernet who had recently written: “although the establishment of a system of regulation of water courses and irrigation, and the control of this system, may have affected the political constitution of the military states and imperial China, the fact remains that, historically, it was the pre-existing state structures and the large, well-trained labour force provided by the armies that made the great irrigation projects possible”. Turning to Mexico, Carneiro wrote: “large-scale irrigation systems do not appear to antedate the Classic period, whereas it is clear that the first states arose in the preceding Formative or Pre-Classic period”. Of hydraulic empires generally, Carneiro commented: \"This is not to say, of course, that large-scale irrigation, where it occurred, did not contribute significantly to increasing the power and scope of the state. It unquestionably did. To the extent that Wittfogel limits himself to this contention, I have no quarrel with him whatever. However, the point at issue is not how the state increased its power but how it arose in the first place. And to this issue the hydraulic hypothesis does not appear to hold the key.\"\n\nThe same elements of resource control central to hydraulic empire were also central to Europe's colonization of much of the global South. Colonies were resource rich areas located on the periphery, and the contemporary models of core-periphery interaction were focused on the extraction and control of these resources for the use of the core. This was accomplished through a type of agro-managerial despotism with close connections to debates around hydraulic empire.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7109853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7109853", "title": "Hélinand of Froidmont", "text": "Hélinand of Froidmont\n\nHélinand of Froidmont (c. 1150—after 1229 (probably 1237)) was a medieval poet, chronicler, and ecclesiastical writer.\n\nHe was born of Flemish parents at Pronleroy in Oise in France c. 1150; his date of death is said to be 3 February 1223, or 1229, or 1237. His talents as a minstrel won the favor of King Philip Augustus, and for some time he freely indulged in the pleasures of the world, after which he became a Cistercian monk at the monastery of Froidmont in the Diocese of Beauvais about the year 1190. From being a self-indulgent man of the world he became a model of piety and mortification in the monastery. Whatever time was not consumed in monastic exercises he devoted to ecclesiastical studies and, after his ordination to the priesthood, to preaching and writing. The Church of Beauvais honors him as a saint and celebrates his feast day on 3 February.\n\nHélinand of Froidmont is sometimes confused with the Cistercian Hélinand of Perseigne, the author of a commentary on the Apocalypse and glosses on the Book of Exodus, although there are no arguments for this identification.\n\nHélinand is most remembered for his \"Chronicon\", a world-chronicle in Latin containing forty-nine books (of which only less than half have survived), which he compiled from 1211 to 1223. Helinand incorporated several of his treatises and letters into his \"Chronicon\". These include moral treatises such as \"De cognitione sui\", and \"De bono regimine principis\", twenty-eight sermons on various Church festivals; one epistle entitled \"De reparatione lapsi\", in which he exhorts a renegade monk to return to his monastery. The \"Chronicon\" itself is largely a compilation of texts taken from a wide range of sources.\n\nVincent of Beauvais on his turn based his \"Speculum Historiale\", which provided a history of the world down to his time, on the \"Chronicon\" of Helinand.\n\nSurviving parts of the \"Chronicon\" include Books 1-18, covering the period from the creation to the death of Alexander the Great; fragments from Books 19-44, surviving as copies in the \"Speculum Maius\" of Vincent of Beauvais; the text of books 45-49, which deal with the period from 634 to 1204. Books 45-49 of the \"Chronicon\" serve as a source for the chronicle by the Cistercian monk Aubri de Trois-Fontaines (Alberic of Trois-Fontaines) (c. 1241).\n\nAccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia, \"his chronicle is not sufficiently critical to be of much historical value.\" Yet it would be unfair to call Helinand an uncritical writer - or rather, compiler - of history, as from time to time he interrupts the narrative to alert the reader where his sources diverge from each other, often trying to harmonize them in much the same fashion as a scholastic treatise. The structure of the \"Chronicon\" is mainly chronological, although Helinand frequently digresses from the historical account to comment on Scripture, include a treatise against astrology, write about saints and their legends, examine the animal world, or incorporate material from Latin literature or vernacular traditions. He is frequently quoted as a medieval authority on the meaning of the word \"graal,\" i.e. the Holy Grail. In this sense, the \"Chronicon's\" value is not based on its existence as a work on history. He is cited, for example, as a source of the description of the flight of Eilmer of Malmesbury.\n\nHelinand wrote a work in Old French called \"Les Vers de la Mort\" (\"Verses of Death\") shortly after entering the monastery, between 1194 and 1197. In fifty stanzas, Helinand asks Death to call upon his best friends and exhort them to abandon the world. Each stanza contains twelve octosyllabic lines; the rhyme scheme is aab aab bba bba. This form was imitated by later poets and is called by critics the \"helinandian stanza.\" In this poem, Death appears as a ubiquitous and hyperactive agent. Helinand does not use macabre elements, except in the title, which puns on the homonymy between \"vers\" (worms) and \"vers\" (verses). His lyrical sermon uses various tropes such as anaphora, metaphor, and adnomination to great effect. Throughout this unique testimony of his poetic talent as a \"trouvère\", Helinand appears as a precursor of Villon, Chastelain , and other French poets of the 15th century. \n\nAs a well-known preacher, he wrote more than sixty Latin sermons. His sermons, written in a neat Latin style, give evidence of a remarkable acquaintance with the pagan poets as well as with the Fathers of the Church.\n\nA \"Martyrium\" of Saints Gereon, Victor, Cassius, and Florentius, martyrs of the Theban Legion used to be attributed to Helinand, but it is unclear whether he is the true author.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6857180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6857180", "title": "Mubarak Ali", "text": "Mubarak Ali\n\nMubarak Ali (), is a Pakistani historian, activist and scholar. His main theme, in most of his books, has been that some history books written in Pakistan had been 'dictated' by the ruling class (the so-called 'Establishmint in Pakistan') and, in his view, those history books represent 'perversion of facts'.\n\nAli was born in Tonk, a pathan state, British India on April 21, 1941.\nAli received a M.A. degree in history from Sindh University, Jamshoro in 1963. In 1972, he went to London, then Germany to pursue higher studies and in 1976, he attained a PhD degree (on the Mughal Period of India) at Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany. He later became head of the History Department at the University of Sindh. He was the Director of the Goethe Institute in Lahore until 1996. In 2005, he is the editor of the quarterly journal \"Taarikh\" (\"History\") and has been widely interviewed by electronic and print media in India, Pakistan and the Middle East.\n\nIn 1999, while speaking at a seminar in Mumbai organised by the NGO Khoj, Ali referred to fundamentalism's effects on historical scholarship in his country. He described how after the 1965 war with India, ancient history was de-emphasized in Pakistan by some historians. The official government rule stated that anything outside of the syllabus \"is not part of our history\". He further stated that the official historiography in Pakistan is committed to the two-nation theory in the Indian subcontinent. In other words, Hindus and Muslims in pre-1947 era British India essentially were 2 different and distinct nations and, therefore, the British needed to divide old India into 2 different countries, based on this fact, before they ended their colonial rule in British India. This was called the Pakistan Movement and it succeeded in its effort with the support of the majority of the Indian Muslims under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and an independent Pakistan was created in 1947. Although later, after independence of Pakistan in 1947, many history book writers ignored the Pakistan public's need for the truth and keeping a balanced view of history when writing their history books. Instead, some historians went to the other extreme and started to confuse the Pakistani public about whether Pakistan's known history begins from the 5000 years old Indus Valley Civilization or from the Arab Muslims Muhammad bin Qasim (31 Dec 695-18 July 715)] and his attack on Sindh in 712 A.D. or from the Independence of Pakistan in 1947.\n\nSpeaking at the \"National Seminar on Rani Kot\", a historic location and fort in Sindh, he called for the reading and writing of history from a different angle, in which invaders of old and ancient India should not be always acclaimed as \"great\". He said that archaeological sites do have their own significance, referring to the discovery of Mohenjo-daro which reflected a great civilization of the region. This discovery played a dominant role in the independence movement of the subcontinent, because until its discovery, people of this part of the world were not considered literate or civilised.\n\nHe has written a number of books and articles on Ind-Pakistani history, and has been widely acclaimed as an anti-establishment and anti-government thinker and historian. He stated in an interview that \"No authentic history has yet been written about Pakistan and its independence. There is a lot of confusion among the so-called pro-Establishment historians and educationists. Whatever has been written so far is distortion of history and entirely unbalanced.\"\n\nDr Mubarak Ali has called for the rewriting of the subcontinent's history and correction of what he called \"historical aberrations\", so that the hatred and misunderstanding prevailing between the people of India and Pakistan could come to an end. He said textbooks in the two countries had been systematically distorted and that the time has come to reverse the trend.\n\nAli has said that \"any system based on oppression, coercion and authoritarianism [is] the first problem in the way of writing history\". Pakistan's history has been dictated, he said, by politics and the personal ideologies of autocratic rulers and military dictators. He also reiterated his call for \"history to be analyzed and rewritten from the perspective of the masses instead of the viewpoint of rulers.\"\n\nIn 2005, Mubarak Ali claimed that the police was harassing him and investigating him to \"verify his learning\", and that he was considering leaving Pakistan forever. Four police First Information Reports were lodged against him in Lahore.\n\nIn 2007, Mubarak Ali published three books: \"Qadeem Hindustan\" (\"Ancient India\"), \"Ahd-e-Wusta Ka Hindustan\" (\"India of the Middle Ages\") and \"Bartanvi Hindustan\" (\"British India\"), published jointly by the NGO ActionAid and the Fiction House. These books were targeted towards younger readers. Speaking at the launch, Ali stated that some of the Pakistani curricula did not contain any citation about Ashoka the Great, whose reign witnessed peace and religious harmony. According to Ali, \"it was the British who destroyed the harmony and sowed the seeds of hatred among Hindus and Muslims as the Mughals' policy of religious harmony continued to be applied during their ruling period (1526-1857) despite all sorts of hiccups\".\n\nAccording to Mubarak Ali, the textbook reform in Pakistan began with the introduction of Pakistan Studies and Islamic studies by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1971, which became a compulsory subject in the national curriculum. In the 1980s, former military dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, as part of a general drive towards Islamization, started the process of historical revisionism and exploited this initiative. \"The Pakistani establishment taught their children right from the beginning that this state was built on the basis of religion – that's why they do not have tolerance for other religions and want to wipe out all of them.\"\n\nSpeaking at the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan office in May 2009, Mubarak Ali said, \"democracy in Pakistan had an imprint of martial laws and what we were witnessing today could at best be described as 'feudal democracy'. It is the third generation of feudals who are ruling Pakistan\". Although Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) lost the elections, Ali argued that religiosity had grown in Pakistan to such an extent that \"every political party in the National Assembly is an MMA and it is the assembly that approved Nizam-e-Adl regulation.\"\n\nHis 2009 comprehensive book in Urdu, \"Taareekh Ki Daryafat\", is considered to be his most concise work. The first part of the book deals with heroism and society, historiography in the 20th century, how we should write history and his autobiography, while the second part covers a large number of topics. These interpretations highlight national controversies, for example about Mughal Muslims in India, the relationship between the Ottomans and the Mughals, religion and its political use, Islamic scholars and modernism, French revolution, Indus Civilization, imperialism and fundamentalism, history of coil and coffee, honor killings in Pakistan, forgetful men and the latest trends in historiography.\n\n(All books are available at Fiction House Urdu Bazar, Karachi and Lahore)\n\n\nSome other major historians of Pakistan are listed below:\n\n\n"}

Six years later, he performed in a wandering circus as a clown. He attended a gymnasium in Pskov, before moving to the School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. It was there that he staged his first full-fledged play, \"The Rehearsal\", followed by an opéra bouffe, \"The Power of Charms\" (1899).\n\nHaving matriculated from the school in 1901, Evreinov turned his attention to music and studied with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov at the Moscow Conservatory for a couple of years. In 1907-08 and 1911-12 he was involved in reconstructing the world of medieval plays and those dating from the Spanish Golden Age at the Starinny Theatre (\"Old-Fashioned Theatre\") in Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe foremost Russian actress, Vera Komissarzhevskaya, asked him to cast her in the leading role for his version of \"Francesca da Rimini\" (1908). Later that year, Evreinov's production of Oscar Wilde's \"Salomé\" was suppressed on the orders of Nicholas II. Evreinov's association with the Komissarzhevsky family continued for several years. Together with Theodore Komisarjevsky, he staged a number of \"harlequinades\" and \"monodramas\" as part of his new project, \"The Merry Theatre for Aged Children\". His concept of \"monodrama\" was exemplified in \"The Theater of the Soul\", a 1915 production set inside the human breast as the repository of the soul.\n\nIn 1910, Evreinov quit his job at the Ministry of Railways to take the helm as producer, dramatist, and composer of the False Mirror Theatre in Saint Petersburg. It was there that he staged more than one hundred plays, including fourteen pieces written by himself. His production of \"The Government Inspector\" was a milestone in the history of Russian theatre: each act was staged so as to parody one of the following aesthetics: provincial realist theatres, the Moscow Art Theatre of Constantin Stanislavski, the techniques of Edward Gordon Craig and Max Reinhardt, and slapstick comedy films.\n\nIn 1922 and 1923 Evreinov visited Berlin and Paris where his plays were produced by the likes of Jacques Copeau and Charles Dullin. He spent the rest of his life in Paris, working with the , Sorbonne, and Serge Lifar. He prepared a comprehensive monograph tracing the \"History of Russian Theatre\" through the centuries. Many of his later plays have never been staged, including the \"anti-Stalinist drama\" \"The Steps of Nemesis\", with such characters as Alexei Rykov, Nikolai Bukharin, Genrikh Yagoda, and Nikolai Yezhov.\n\nIn 1920 Evreinov staged the mass spectacle \"The Storming of the Winter Palace\", a re-creation of that pivotal event of the October Revolution on its three-year anniversary. The mass spectacle form took the pre-revolutionary Symbolist utopias of \"ritual theatre\" (whose formulation was largely a response to the abortive 1905 revolution), and recast their 'people' as the proletariat. Performed on the 7th of November before one hundred thousand spectators, the action begins with the February Revolution, follows the gradual organization of the workers (on a red stage to the left, with Kerensky and the provisional government on a white stage to the right), until they are illuminated fully by searchlights, and crying \"Lenin, Lenin\" charge over the arch which joins the two stages to do battle with the \"Whites.\" Kerensky leaps to a car for an escape, and is pursued along a path between the two large groups of spectators by trucks full of the Red Guard waving bayonets, to the Palace. Silhouettes struggle in the windows of the Palace, until the Red Army is finally successful, and red lights flash out. A cannon fired from the battleship \"Aurora\" and fireworks herald the victory of the October Revolution. Also later possibly inspired by the fireworks, and cannon fire, the color orange somehow became one of the official colors of October.\n\nEvreinov argued that the role of theatre was to ape and mimick nature. In his estimation, theatre is everything around us. He pointed out that nature is full of theatrical conventions: desert flowers mimicking the stones; mouse feigning death in order to escape a cat's claws; complicated dances of birds, etc. He viewed theatre as a universal symbol of existence.\n\n\"Apology for Theatricality\" is his most famous essay. It was published in 1908. Here Evreinov promoted an underlying aesthetic:\n\nThe director sought to reinvigorate the theatre (and through it life itself) through the rediscovery of the origin of theatre in play. He was influenced by the philosophies of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Bergson, and, like Meyerhold, the aesthetics of symbolism and the commedia dell'arte (particularly in its use of mask and spontaneity). Evreinov developed his theatrical theories in \"An Introduction to Monodrama\" (1909), \"The Theatre as Such\" (1912), \"The Theatre for Oneself\", and \"Pro Scena Sua\" (1915).\n\nHis plays include the monodramas \"The Presentation of Love\" (1910) and \"In the Stage-Wings of the Soul\" (1911), the tragi-farce \" A Merry Death\" (1908, based on Alexander Blok's \"The Puppet Show\"), and \"The Chief Thing\" (1921); the last two of which were heavily indebted to the \"commedia\". Based on Maxim Gorky's \"The Lower Depths\" (1902), \"The Chief Thing\" provided Evreinov's one international success, was done on stage and screen in France as \"La Comedie du Bonheur\" and was staged on Broadway in 1926 by Theater Guild with Harold Clurman and Edward G. Robinson. His \"Ship of the Righteous \" was a great success in Poland. According to Spencer Golub, \"The Chief Thing\" play provides a \"compendium of Evreinovian aesthetics and devices\" and features Harlequin \"as death-defier and life-transformer\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25179987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25179987", "title": "Slave breeding in the United States", "text": "Slave breeding in the United States\n\nSlave breeding in the United States includes any practice of slave ownership that aimed to systematically influence the reproduction of slaves in order to increase the wealth of slaveholders. Slave breeding included coerced sexual relations between male and female slaves, promoting pregnancies of slaves, and favoring female slaves who could produce a relatively large number of children. The purpose of slave breeding was to acquire new slaves without incurring the cost of purchase, and to fill labor shortages caused by the termination of the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nSelective breeding between slaves with the aim of developing particular physical traits was uncommon however, as most slaves were unrestricted in their choice of sexual partners.\n\nThe laws that ultimately ended the Atlantic Slave Trade came about as a result of the efforts of abolitionist Christian groups such as the Society of Friends, known as Quakers, and Evangelicals led by William Wilberforce, whose efforts through the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade led to the passage of the Slave Trade Act by the British Parliament in 1807. This led to increased calls for the same ban in America, supported by members of the U.S. Congress from both the North and the South as well as President Thomas Jefferson.\n\nAt the same time that the importation of slaves from Africa was being restricted or eliminated, the United States was undergoing a rapid expansion of cotton, sugar cane and rice production in the Deep South and the West. Invention of the cotton gin enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton, which could be produced more widely than other types; this led to King Cotton throughout the Deep South. Slaves were treated as a commodity by owners and traders alike, and were regarded as the crucial labor for the production of lucrative cash crops that fed the triangle trade.\n\nThe slaves were managed as assets in the same way as chattel; slaveholders passed laws regulating slavery and the slave trade designed to protect their financial interests; there was little protection for the slaves. On large plantations, slave families were separated for different types of labor. Men tended to be assigned to large field gangs. Workers were assigned to the task for which they were best physically suited according to the overseer.\n\nThe prohibition of the African slave trade after 1807 limited the supply of slaves in the United States. Slaveholders looked at the fertility of slave women as part of their productivity, and intermittently forced the women to have large numbers of children. The invention of the cotton gin enabled expanded cultivation in the uplands of short-staple cotton, leading to clearing lands cultivating cotton through large areas of the Deep South, especially the Black Belt. The demand for labor in the area increased sharply and an internal slave market expanded. At the same time, the Upper South had an excess supply of slaves because of a shift to mixed-crops agriculture, which was less labor-intensive than tobacco. During this time period, the terms \"breeding slaves\", \"child bearing women\", \"breeding period\", and \"too old to breed\" became familiar.\n\nPlanters in the Upper South states started selling slaves to the Deep South, generally through slave traders such as Franklin and Armfield. Louisville, Kentucky, on the Ohio River was a major slave market and port for shipping slaves downriver by the Mississippi to the South. New Orleans had the largest slave market in the country and became the fourth largest city in the US by 1840 and the wealthiest, mostly because of its slave trade and associated businesses.\n\nIn the antebellum years, numerous escaped slaves wrote about their experiences in books called slave narratives. Many recounted that at least a portion of slave owners continuously interfered in the sexual lives of their slaves (usually the women). The slave narratives also testified that slave women were subjected to arranged marriages, forced matings, sexual violation by masters, their sons or overseers, and other forms of abuse. Skeptics maintain that reports from witnesses were apocryphal, and never specified a particular place in which breeding practices were alleged to have occurred.\n\nThe historian E. Franklin Frazier, in his book \"The Negro Family\", stated that \"there were masters who, without any regard for the preferences of their slaves, mated their human chattel as they did their stock.\" Ex-slave Maggie Stenhouse remarked, \"Durin' slavery there were stockmen. They was weighed and tested. A man would rent the stockman and put him in a room with some young women he wanted to raise children from.\"\n\nSeveral factors coalesced to make the breeding of slaves a common practice by the end of the 18th century, chief among them the enactment of laws and practices that transformed the view of slaves from \"personhood\" into \"thinghood.\" In this way, slaves could be bought and sold as chattel without presenting a challenge to the religious beliefs and social mores of the society at large. All rights were to the owner of the slave, with the slave having no rights of self-determination either to his or her own person, spouse, or children.\n\nSlaveholders began to think that slavery was grounded in the Bible. This view was inspired in part by a reinterpretation of the Genesis passage \"Cursed be Canaan; The lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers\" (Genesis 9); Ham, son of Noah and father of Canaan, was deemed the antediluvian progenitor of the African people. Some whites used the Bible to justify the economic use of slave labor. The subjugation of slaves was taken as a natural right of the white slave owners. The second class position of the slave was not limited to his relationship with the slave master but was to be in relation to all whites. Slaves were considered subject to white persons.\n\nIn a study of 2,588 slaves in 1860 by the economist Richard Sutch, he found that on slave-holdings with at least one woman, the average ratio of women to men exceeded 2:1. The imbalance was greater in the \"selling states\", where the excess of women over men was 300 per thousand.\nNed Sublette, co-author of \"The American Slave Coast\", states that the reproductive worth of \"breeding women\" was essential to the young country's expansion not just for labor but as merchandise and collateral stemming from a shortage of silver, gold, or sound paper tender. He concludes that slaves and their descendants were used as human savings accounts with newborns serving as interest that functioned as the basis of money and credit in a market premised on the continual expansion of slavery.\n\nRobert Fogel and Stanley Engerman reject the idea that \"systematic\" slave breeding was a major economic concern in their 1974 book \"Time on the Cross\". They argue that there is very meager evidence for the systematic breeding of slaves for sale in the market in the Upper South during the 19th century. They distinguish systematic breeding—the interference in normal sexual patterns by masters with an aim to increase fertility or encourage desirable characteristics—from pro-natalist policies, the generalized encouragement of large families through a combination of rewards, improved living and working conditions for fertile women and their children, and other policy changes by masters. They point out that the demographic evidence is subject to a number of interpretations. Fogel argues that when planters intervened in the private lives of slaves it actually had a negative impact on population growth.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

{"id": "43468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43468", "title": "T. E. Lawrence", "text": "T. E. Lawrence\n\nThomas Edward Lawrence, (16 August 1888 – 19 May 1935) was a British archaeologist, army officer, diplomat, and writer. He was renowned for his liaison role during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. The breadth and variety of his activities and associations, and his ability to describe them vividly in writing, earned him international fame as Lawrence of Arabia—a title used for the 1962 film based on his wartime activities. \n\nHe was born out of wedlock in Tremadog, Wales, in August 1888 to Thomas Chapman (who became, in 1914, Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet), an Anglo-Irish nobleman from County Westmeath, and Sarah Junner, a Scottish governess, whom Chapman had left his wife and first family in Ireland to cohabit with; they called themselves Mr and Mrs Lawrence. The name \"Lawrence\" was probably adopted from that of Sarah's likely father, member of a family of that name where her mother was employed as a servant when she became pregnant. In 1889 the family moved to Kirkcudbright in Scotland where his brother William George was born before moving to Dinard in France. In 1896, the Lawrences moved to Oxford, where their son attended the High School and then from 1907 to 1910 studied History at Jesus College. Between 1910 and 1914 he worked as an archaeologist for the British Museum, chiefly at Carchemish, in Ottoman Syria.\n\nSoon after the outbreak of war he volunteered for the British Army and was stationed in Egypt. In 1916, he was sent to Arabia on an intelligence mission and quickly became involved with the Arab Revolt, providing, along with other British officers, liaison to the Arab forces. Working closely with Emir Faisal, a leader of the revolt, he participated in and sometimes led military activities against the Ottoman armed forces, culminating in the capture of Damascus in October 1918.\n\nAfter the war, Lawrence joined the Foreign Office, working with both the British government and with Faisal. In 1922, he retreated from public life and spent the years until 1935 serving as an enlisted man, mostly in the Royal Air Force, with a brief stint in the Army. During this time, he wrote and published his best-known work, \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\", an autobiographical account of his participation in the Arab Revolt. He also translated books into English and wrote \"The Mint\", which was published posthumously and detailed his time in the Royal Air Force working as an ordinary aircraftman. He corresponded extensively and was friendly with well-known artists, writers, and politicians. For the Royal Air Force, he participated in the development of rescue motorboats.\nLawrence's public image resulted in part from the sensationalised reporting of the Arab revolt by American journalist Lowell Thomas, as well as from \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\". In 1935, Lawrence was fatally injured in a motorcycle accident in Dorset.\n\nThomas Edward Lawrence was born on 16 August 1888 in Tremadog, Carnarvonshire (now Gwynedd), Wales in a house named Gorphwysfa, now known as Snowdon Lodge. His Anglo-Irish father Thomas Chapman had left his wife Edith after he fell in love and had a son with Sarah Junner, a young Scotswoman who had been engaged as governess to his daughters. Sarah was the daughter of Elizabeth Junner and John Lawrence, who worked as a ship's carpenter and was a son of the household in which Elizabeth had been a servant. She was dismissed four months before Sarah was born. (Elizabeth identified Sarah's father as \"John Junner – Shipwright journeyman\".)\nSarah and Thomas did not marry, but lived together under the name Lawrence. In 1914, Sir Thomas inherited the Chapman baronetcy based at Killua Castle, the ancestral family home in County Westmeath, Ireland; but he and Sarah continued to live in England. They had five sons; Thomas Edward was the second eldest. From Wales the family moved to Kirkcudbright, Galloway in southwestern Scotland, then Dinard in Brittany, then to Jersey. In 1894–96, the family lived at Langley Lodge (now demolished), set in private woods between the eastern borders of the New Forest and Southampton Water in Hampshire. The residence was isolated, and young \"Ned\" Lawrence had many opportunities for outdoor activities and waterfront visits. Victorian-Edwardian Britain was a very conservative society where the majority of people were God-fearing Christians with the corollary that premarital and extramarital sex were considered deeply shameful and those born illegitimate were born disgraced. Despite having in many ways a happy childhood and youth, Lawrence was always something of an outsider, a bastard who could never hope to achieve the same level of social acceptance and success that those born legitimate could expect, and who was virtually unmarriageable as no girl from a respectable family would ever marry a bastard.\n\nIn the summer of 1896, the Lawrences moved to 2, Polstead Road in Oxford, where they lived until 1921. Lawrence attended the City of Oxford High School for Boys from 1896 until 1907, where one of the four houses was later named \"Lawrence\" in his honour; the school closed in 1966. Lawrence and one of his brothers became commissioned officers in the Church Lads' Brigade at St Aldate's Church.\n\nLawrence claimed that he ran away from home circa 1905 and served for a few weeks as a boy soldier with the Royal Garrison Artillery at St Mawes Castle in Cornwall, from which he was bought out. No evidence of this appears in army records.\n\nAt the age of 15, Lawrence and his schoolfriend Cyril Beeson cycled around Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire, visited almost every village's parish church, studied their monuments and antiquities, and made rubbings of their monumental brasses. Lawrence and Beeson monitored building sites in Oxford and presented their finds to the Ashmolean Museum. The Ashmolean's \"Annual Report\" for 1906 said that the two teenage boys \"by incessant watchfulness secured everything of antiquarian value which has been found.\" In the summers of 1906 and 1907, Lawrence and Beeson toured France by bicycle, collecting photographs, drawings, and measurements of medieval castles. In August 1907 Lawrence wrote home: \"The Chaignons & the Lamballe people, complimented me on my wonderful French: I have been asked twice since I arrived what part of France I came from\".\n\nFrom 1907 to 1910, Lawrence read History at Jesus College, Oxford. In the summer of 1909, he set out alone on a three-month walking tour of crusader castles in Ottoman Syria, during which he travelled on foot. Lawrence graduated with First Class Honours after submitting a thesis titled \"The Influence of the Crusades on European Military Architecture—to the End of the 12th Century\", based on his field research with Beeson in France, notably in Châlus, and his solo research in the Middle East. Lawrence was fascinated by the Middle Ages with his brother Arnold writing in 1937 that for him \"medieval researches\" were a \"dream way of escape from bourgeois England\". \nIn 1910 Lawrence was offered the opportunity to become a practising archaeologist in the Middle East, at Carchemish, in the expedition that D. G. Hogarth was setting up on behalf of the British Museum. Hogarth arranged a \"Senior Demyship\", a form of scholarship, for Lawrence at Magdalen College, Oxford, to fund Lawrence's work at £100 a year.\n\nIn December 1910, he sailed for Beirut and on his arrival went to Jbail (Byblos), where he studied Arabic. He then went to work on the excavations at Carchemish, near Jerablus in northern Syria, where he worked under Hogarth, R. Campbell Thompson of the British Museum, and Leonard Woolley, until 1914. He later stated that everything which he had accomplished he owed to Hogarth. While excavating at Carchemish, Lawrence met Gertrude Bell. In 1912 Lawrence worked briefly with Flinders Petrie at Kafr Ammar in Egypt.\n\nIn January 1914, Woolley and Lawrence were co-opted by the British military as an archaeological smokescreen for a British military survey of the Negev Desert. They were funded by the Palestine Exploration Fund to search for an area referred to in the Bible as the \"Wilderness of Zin\". Along the way, they made an archaeological survey of the Negev Desert. The Negev was strategically important as, in the event of war, any Ottoman army attacking Egypt would have to cross it. Woolley and Lawrence subsequently published a report of the expedition's archaeological findings, but a more important result was updated mapping of the area, with special attention to features of military relevance such as water sources. Lawrence also visited Aqaba and Petra.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914, Lawrence did not immediately enlist in the British Army. On the advice of S. F. Newcombe, he held back until October, when he was commissioned on the General List. Before the end of the year he had been summoned by renowned archaeologist and historian Lt. Cmdr. David Hogarth to the nascent Arab Bureau intelligence unit in Cairo. Lawrence arrived in Cairo on 15 December 1914. The Bureau's chief was General Gilbert Clayton who reported to Egyptian High Commissioner Henry McMahon.\n\nThe situation during 1915 was complex. Within the Arabic-speaking Ottoman territories, there was a growing Arab-nationalist movement, including many Arabs serving in the Ottoman armed forces. They were in contact with Sharif Hussein, Emir of Mecca, who was negotiating with the British, offering to lead an Arab uprising against the Ottomans. In exchange, he wanted a British guarantee of an independent Arab state including the Hejaz, Syria, and Mesopotamia. Such an uprising would have been very helpful to Britain in its war against the Ottomans, in particular greatly lessening the threat against the Suez Canal.\n\nHowever, there was resistance from French diplomats, who insisted that Syria's future was as a French colony not an independent Arab state. There were also strong objections from the Government of India which, although nominally part of the British government, acted independently. Its vision was of Mesopotamia under British control serving as a granary for India; furthermore, it wanted to hold on to its Arabian outpost in Aden.\n\nAt the Arab Bureau, Lawrence supervised the preparation of maps, produced a daily bulletin for the British generals operating in the theatre, and interviewed prisoners. He was an advocate of a British landing at Alexandretta, which never came to pass. He was also a consistent advocate of an independent Arab Syria.\n\nIn October 1915, the situation came to a crisis, as Sharif Hussein demanded an immediate commitment from Britain, with the threat that if this were denied, he would throw his weight behind the Ottomans. This would create a credible Pan-Islamic message that could have been very dangerous for Britain, which was under stress, at that moment in severe difficulties in the Gallipoli Campaign. The British replied with a letter from High Commissioner McMahon that was generally agreeable, while reserving commitments concerning the Mediterranean coastline and Holy Land.\n\nIn the spring of 1916, Lawrence was dispatched to Mesopotamia to assist in relieving the Siege of Kut by some combination of starting an Arab uprising and bribing Ottoman officials. This mission produced no useful result. Meanwhile, unbeknown to the British officials in Cairo, the Sykes–Picot Agreement was being negotiated in London, which awarded a large proportion of Syria to France. Further, it implied that if the Arabs were to have any sort of state in Syria, they would have to conquer its four great cities: Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo. It is unclear at what point Lawrence became aware of the treaty's contents.\n\nThe Arab Revolt began in June 1916, and after a few initial successes bogged down, with a real risk the Ottoman forces would advance along the coast of the Red Sea and recapture Mecca. On 16 October 1916, Lawrence was sent to the Hejaz on an intelligence-gathering mission led by Ronald Storrs. He visited and interviewed three of Sharif Hussein's sons: Ali, Abdullah, and Faisal. He concluded that Faisal was the best candidate to lead the Revolt.\n\nIn November, it was decided to assign S. F. Newcombe to lead a permanent British liaison to Faisal's staff. As Newcombe had not yet arrived in the area and the matter was of some urgency, Lawrence was sent in his place. In late December 1916, Faisal and Lawrence worked out a plan for repositioning the Arab forces to prevent the Ottoman forces around Medina from threatening Arab positions and putting the railway from Syria under threat. When Newcombe arrived and Lawrence was preparing to leave Arabia, Faisal intervened urgently, asking that Lawrence's assignment become permanent. Lawrence remained attached to Faisal's forces until the fall of Damascus in 1918.\n\nLawrence's most important contributions to the Arab Revolt were in the area of strategy and liaison with British armed forces but he also participated personally in several military engagements:\n\n\nIn June 1917, on the way to Aqaba, Lawrence made a 300-mile personal journey northward, visiting Ras Baalbek, the outskirts of Damascus, and Azraq. He met Arab nationalists, counselling them to avoid revolt until the arrival of Faisal's forces, and attacked a bridge to create the impression of guerrilla activity. His findings were regarded by the British as extremely valuable and there was serious consideration of awarding him a Victoria Cross; in the end, he was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and promoted to Major.\n\nLawrence travelled regularly between British HQ and Faisal, co-ordinating military action. But by early 1918, Faisal's chief British liaison was Colonel Pierce Charles Joyce, and Lawrence's time was chiefly devoted to raiding and intelligence-gathering.\n\nBy the summer of 1918, the Turks were offering a substantial reward for Lawrence's capture, initially £5,000 and eventually £20,000 (approx $2.1 million in 2017 dollars or £1.5 million). One officer wrote in his notes: \"Though a price of £15,000 has been put on his head by the Turks, no Arab has, as yet, attempted to betray him. The Sharif of Mecca has given him the status of one of his sons, and he is just the finely tempered steel that supports the whole structure of our influence in Arabia. He is a very inspiring gentleman adventurer.\"\n\nThe chief elements of the Arab strategy, developed chiefly by Faisal and Lawrence, were firstly to avoid capturing Medina, and secondly to extend northwards through Maan and Dera'a to Damascus and beyond. The Emir Faisal wanted to lead regular attacks against the Ottomans, which Lawrence persuaded him to drop. Lawrence wrote about the Bedouin as a fighting force: \"The value of the tribes is defensive only and their real sphere is guerilla warfare. They are intelligent, and very lively, almost reckless, but too individualistic to endure commands, or fight in line, or to help each other. It would, I think, be possible to make an organized force out of them...The Hejaz war is one of dervishes against regular forces-and we are on the side of the dervishes. Our text-books do not apply to its conditions at all\".\n\nMedina was an attractive target for the revolt as Islam's second holiest site, and because its Ottoman garrison was weakened by disease and isolation. It became clear that it was advantageous to leave it there rather than try to capture it, while continually attacking, but not permanently breaking, the Hejaz railway south from Damascus. This prevented the Ottomans from making effective use of their troops at Medina, and forced them to dedicate many resources to defending and repairing the railway line.\n\nThe movement north to Damascus and eventually Aleppo is interesting in the context of the Sykes-Picot agreement. While it is not known when Lawrence learned the details of Sykes-Picot, nor if or when he briefed Faisal on what he knew, there is good reason to think that both these things happened, and earlier rather than later. In particular, the Arab strategy of northward extension makes perfect sense given the Sykes-Picot language that spoke of an independent Arab entity in Syria, which would only be granted if the Arabs liberated the territory themselves. The French, and some of their British Liaison officers, were specifically uncomfortable about the northward movement, as it would weaken French colonial claims.\n\nIn 1917, Lawrence successfully proposed a joint action with the Arab irregulars and forces including Auda Abu Tayi (until then in the employ of the Ottomans) against the strategically located but lightly defended town of Aqaba on the Red Sea. While Aqaba could have been captured by an attack from the sea, the narrow defiles leading inland through the mountains were strongly defended and would have been very difficult to assault. The expedition was led by the well-respected Sharif Nasir of Medina.\n\nLawrence carefully avoided informing his British superiors about the details of the planned inland attack, due to concern that it would be blocked as contrary to French interests. The expedition departed from Wejh on 9 May. Aqaba fell to the Arab forces on 6 July, after a surprise overland attack, taking the Turkish defences from behind.\n\nAfter Aqaba, General Sir Edmund Allenby, the new commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, agreed to Lawrence's strategy for the revolt, stating after the war:\n\nAfter the fall of Aqaba, Lawrence held a powerful position as an adviser to Faisal and a person who had Allenby's confidence.\n\nIn both \"Seven Pillars\" and a 1919 letter to a military colleague, Lawrence describes an episode on 20 November 1917 while reconnoitering Dera'a in disguise when he was captured by the Ottoman military, heavily beaten, and sexually abused by the local bey and his guardsmen. The precise nature of the sexual contact is not specified. James Barr, author of \"Setting the Desert on Fire: T E Lawrence and Britain's Secret War in Arabia 1916-1918\", has claimed that the episode was invented and that Lawrence was never in or near Dera'a. Also, scholars have stated (with some evidence) that he exaggerated the severity of the injuries he claimed to have suffered. There is no independent testimony, but the multiple consistent reports and the absence of evidence for outright invention in Lawrence's works make the account believable to his biographers. At least three of Lawrence's biographers, namely Malcolm Brown, John E. Mack, and Jeremy Wilson, have argued that this episode had strong psychological effects on Lawrence, which may explain some of his unconventional behaviour in later life. Lawrence ended his account of the episode in \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\" with the statement: \"In Deraa that night the citadel of my integrity had been irrevocably lost.\"\n\nLawrence was involved in the build-up to the capture of Damascus in the final weeks of the war. He was not present at the city's formal surrender, much to his disappointment and contrary to instructions that he had issued, having arrived several hours after the city had fallen. Lawrence entered Damascus around 9 am on 1 October 1918 but was the third arrival of the day; the first was the 10th Australian Light Horse Brigade, led by Major A.C.N. 'Harry' Olden, who formally accepted the surrender of the city from acting Governor Emir Said. Lawrence was instrumental in establishing a provisional Arab government under Faisal in newly liberated Damascus – which he had envisioned as the capital of an Arab state. Faisal's rule as king, however, came to an abrupt end in 1920, after the battle of Maysaloun, when the French Forces of General Gouraud entered Damascus under the command of General Mariano Goybet, destroying Lawrence's dream of an independent Arabia.\n\nDuring the closing years of the war, Lawrence sought to convince his superiors in the British government that Arab independence was in their interests – with mixed success. The secret Sykes-Picot Agreement between France and Britain contradicted the promises of independence that he had made to the Arabs and frustrated his work.\n\nIn 1918, he cooperated with war correspondent Lowell Thomas for a short period. During this time, Thomas and his cameraman Harry Chase shot a great deal of film and many photographs, which Thomas used in a highly lucrative slide-show presentation that toured the world after the war.\n\nLawrence returned to the United Kingdom a full colonel. Immediately after the war, he worked for the Foreign Office, attending the Paris Peace Conference between January and May as a member of Faisal's delegation. On 17 May 1919, the Handley Page Type O carrying Lawrence on a flight to Egypt crashed at the airport of Roma-Centocelle. The pilot and co-pilot were killed; Lawrence survived with a broken shoulder blade and two broken ribs. During his brief hospitalisation, he was visited by the King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III.\n\nIn August 1919, Lowell Thomas launched a colourful photo show in London entitled \"With Allenby in Palestine\", which included a lecture, dancing, and music. \"With Allenby in Palestine\" engaged in what was later deemed \"Orientalism\", the depiction of the Orient—as the Westerners called the Middle East up until World War II—as strange, exotic, mysterious, bizarre, sensuous, and violent. Initially, Lawrence played only a supporting role in the show as the main focus was on Allenby's campaigns, but when Thomas realised that it was the photos of Lawrence dressed as a Bedouin that had captured the public's imagination, he had Lawrence photographed again in London in Arab dress. With the new photos, Thomas re-launched his show under the new title \"With Allenby in Palestine and Lawrence in Arabia\" in early 1920, which proved to be extremely popular. The new title elevating Lawrence from a supporting role to a co-star of the Near Eastern campaign reflected the changed emphasis. Thomas' shows made the previously obscure Lawrence into a household name. Lawrence served for much of 1921 as an adviser to Winston Churchill at the Colonial Office. Lawrence hated bureaucratic work, writing on 21 May 1921 to Robert Graves: \"I wish I hadn't gone out there: the Arabs are like a page I have turned over; and sequels are rotten things. I'm locked up here: office every day and much of it\".\n\nLawrence had a sinister reputation in France, both during his lifetime and even today, being seen as an implacable \"enemy of France\"; the man who was supposedly constantly stirring up the Syrians to revolt against French rule throughout the 1920s. The French historian Maurice Larès wrote that the real reason for France's problems in Syria was that the Syrians did not want to be ruled by France, and the French needed a \"scapegoat\" to blame for their difficulties in ruling the country. Larès wrote that far from being a Francophobe, as he is usually depicted in France, Lawrence was really a Francophile. Larès wrote: \"But we should note that a man rarely devotes much of his time and effort to the study of a language and of the literature of a people he hates, unless this is in order to work for its destruction (Eichmann's behavior may be an instance of this), which was clearly not Lawrence's case. Had Lawrence really disliked the French, would he, even for financial reasons, have translated French novels into English? The quality of his translation of \"Le Gigantesque\" (\"The Forest Giant\") reveals not only his conscientiousness as an artist but also a knowledge of French that can scarcely have derived from unfriendly feelings\". Larès concluded that the popular thesis in France that Lawrence had \"virulent anti-French prejudices\" is not supported by the facts.\nIn August 1922, Lawrence enlisted in the Royal Air Force as an aircraftman, under the name John Hume Ross. At the RAF recruiting centre in Covent Garden, London, he was interviewed by recruiting officer Flying Officer W. E. Johns, later known as the author of the Biggles series of novels. Johns rejected Lawrence's application as he correctly believed that \"Ross\" was a false name. Lawrence admitted that this was so and that the documents he had provided were false. He left, but returned some time later with an RAF messenger, who carried a written order that Johns must accept Lawrence.\n\nHowever, Lawrence was forced out of the RAF in February 1923 after his identity was exposed. He changed his name to T. E. Shaw and joined the Royal Tank Corps later that year. He was unhappy there and repeatedly petitioned to rejoin the RAF, which finally readmitted him in August 1925. A fresh burst of publicity after the publication of \"Revolt in the Desert\" resulted in his assignment, to bases at Karachi and then Miramshah, in then British India (now Pakistan) in late 1926, where he remained until the end of 1928. At that time, he was forced to return to Britain after rumours began to circulate that he was involved in espionage activities.\n\nHe purchased several small plots of land in Chingford, built a hut and swimming pool there, and visited frequently. The hut was removed in 1930 when the Chingford Urban District Council acquired the land. The hut was given to the City of London Corporation, which re-erected it in the grounds of The Warren, Loughton. Lawrence's tenure of the Chingford land has now been commemorated by a plaque fixed on the sighting obelisk on Pole Hill.\n\nLawrence continued serving in the RAF based at RAF Mount Batten near Plymouth, RAF Calshot, near Southampton, and Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, specialising in high-speed boats and professing happiness, and it was with considerable regret that he left the service at the end of his enlistment in March 1935.\n\nIn the inter-war period, the RAF's Marine Craft Section began to have built for it air-sea rescue launches capable of higher speeds and greater capacity. The arrival of high-speed craft into the MCS was driven in part by Lawrence. He had previously witnessed the drowning of the crew of a seaplane when the seaplane tender sent to their rescue was too slow in arriving. Working with Hubert Scott-Paine, the founder of the British Power Boat Company (BPBC), the long ST 200 Seaplane Tender Mk1 was introduced into service. These boats had a range of 140 miles when cruising at 24 knots, and could achieve a top speed of 29 knots.\n\nLawrence was a keen motorcyclist and owned eight Brough Superior motorcycles at different times. His last SS100 (Registration GW 2275) is privately owned but has been on loan to the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu and the Imperial War Museum in London.\n\nAmong the books that Lawrence is known to have carried with him on his military campaigns is Thomas Malory's \"Le Morte d'Arthur\". Accounts of the 1934 discovery of the Winchester Manuscript of the \"Morte\" include a report that, after reading about the discovery in \"The Times\", Lawrence followed Malory scholar Eugene Vinaver from Manchester to Winchester by motorcycle.\n\nAt the age of 46, two months after leaving military service, Lawrence was fatally injured in an accident on his Brough Superior SS100 motorcycle in Dorset, close to his cottage, Clouds Hill, near Wareham. A dip in the road obstructed his view of two boys on their bicycles; he swerved to avoid them, lost control, and was thrown over the handlebars. He died six days later on 19 May 1935. The location is marked by a small memorial at the side of the road.\n\nOne of the doctors attending him was neurosurgeon Hugh Cairns, who consequently began a long study of the unnecessary loss of life by motorcycle dispatch riders through head injuries. His research led to the use of crash helmets by both military and civilian motorcyclists.\n\nThe Moreton estate, which borders Bovington Camp, was owned by Lawrence's cousins, the Frampton family. Lawrence had rented and later bought Clouds Hill from the Framptons. He had been a frequent visitor to their home, Okers Wood House, and had for years corresponded with Louisa Frampton. Lawrence's mother arranged with the Framptons to have him buried in their family plot in the separate burial ground of St Nicholas' Church, Moreton. His coffin was transported on the Frampton estate's bier. Mourners included Winston and Clementine Churchill, E. M. Forster, Lady Astor and Lawrence's youngest brother Arnold.\nLawrence was a prolific writer throughout his life. A large portion of his output was epistolary. He often sent several letters a day. Several collections of his letters have been published. He corresponded with many notable figures, including George Bernard Shaw, Edward Elgar, Winston Churchill, Robert Graves, Noël Coward, E. M. Forster, Siegfried Sassoon, John Buchan, Augustus John, and Henry Williamson. He met Joseph Conrad and commented perceptively on his works. The many letters that he sent to Shaw's wife Charlotte are revealing as to his character. Lawrence's polyglottism enabled him to communicate throughout his travels. It is acknowledged that he could speak French, German, Greek, Latin, Syriac, Turkish and Welsh, and had demonstrated adeptness in learning other dialects and ancient languages.\n\nLawrence published three major texts in his lifetime. The most significant was his account of the Arab Revolt, \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\". Two were translations: Homer's \"Odyssey\" and \"The Forest Giant\", the latter an otherwise forgotten work of French fiction. He received a flat fee for the second translation, and negotiated a generous fee plus royalties for the first.\nLawrence's major work is \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\", an account of his war experiences. In 1919, he had been elected to a seven-year research fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, providing him with support while he worked on the book. In addition to being a memoir of his experiences during the war, certain parts also serve as essays on military strategy, Arabian culture and geography, and other topics. Lawrence re-wrote \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\" three times, once \"blind\" after he lost the manuscript while changing trains at Reading railway station.\n\nThe list of his alleged \"embellishments\" in \"Seven Pillars\" is long, though many such allegations have been disproved with time, most definitively in Jeremy Wilson's . However, Lawrence's own notebooks refute his claim to have crossed the Sinai Peninsula from Aqaba to the Suez Canal in just 49 hours without any sleep. In reality, this famous camel ride lasted for more than 70 hours and was interrupted by two long breaks for sleeping, which Lawrence omitted when he wrote his book.\n\nLawrence acknowledged having been helped in the editing of the book by George Bernard Shaw. In the preface to \"Seven Pillars\", Lawrence offered his \"thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Shaw for countless suggestions of great value and diversity: and for all the present semicolons\".\n\nThe first public edition was published in 1926 as a high-priced private subscription edition, printed in London by Herbert John Hodgson and Roy Manning Pike, with illustrations by Eric Kennington, Augustus John, Paul Nash, Blair Hughes-Stanton, and Hughes-Stanton's wife Gertrude Hermes. Lawrence was afraid that the public would think that he would make a substantial income from the book, and he stated that it was written as a result of his war service. He vowed not to take any money from it, and indeed he did not, as the sale price was one third of the production costs. This, along with his \"saintlike\" generosity, left Lawrence in substantial debt.\n\n\"Revolt in the Desert\" was an abridged version of \"Seven Pillars\" that he began in 1926 and that was published in March 1927 in both limited and trade editions. He undertook a needed but reluctant publicity exercise, which resulted in a best-seller. Again he vowed not to take any fees from the publication, partly to appease the subscribers to \"Seven Pillars\" who had paid dearly for their editions. By the fourth reprint in 1927, the debt from \"Seven Pillars\" was paid off. As Lawrence left for military service in India at the end of 1926, he set up the \"Seven Pillars Trust\" with his friend D. G. Hogarth as a trustee, in which he made over the copyright and any surplus income of \"Revolt in the Desert\". He later told Hogarth that he had \"made the Trust final, to save myself the temptation of reviewing it, if \"Revolt\" turned out a best seller.\"\n\nThe resultant trust paid off the debt, and Lawrence then invoked a clause in his publishing contract to halt publication of the abridgment in the United Kingdom. However, he allowed both American editions and translations, which resulted in a substantial flow of income. The trust paid income either into an educational fund for children of RAF officers who lost their lives or were invalided as a result of service, or more substantially into the RAF Benevolent Fund.\n\nLawrence left unpublished \"The Mint\", a memoir of his experiences as an enlisted man in the Royal Air Force (RAF). For this, he worked from a notebook that he kept while enlisted, writing of the daily lives of enlisted men and his desire to be a part of something larger than himself: the Royal Air Force. The book is stylistically very different from \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\", using sparse prose as opposed to the complicated syntax found in \"Seven Pillars\". It was published posthumously, edited by his brother, Professor A. W. Lawrence.\n\nAfter Lawrence's death, A. W. Lawrence inherited Lawrence's estate and his copyrights as the sole beneficiary. To pay the inheritance tax, he sold the US copyright of \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\" (subscribers' text) outright to Doubleday Doran in 1935. Doubleday still controls publication rights of this version of the text of \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\" in the US, and will continue to do until the copyright expires at the end of 2022 (publication plus 95 years). In 1936 Prof. Lawrence split the remaining assets of the estate, giving Clouds Hill and many copies of less substantial or historical letters to the nation via the National Trust, and then set up two trusts to control interests in T. E. Lawrence's residual copyrights. To the original Seven Pillars Trust, Prof. Lawrence assigned the copyright in \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\", as a result of which it was given its first general publication. To the Letters and Symposium Trust, he assigned the copyright in \"The Mint\" and all Lawrence's letters, which were subsequently edited and published in the book \"T. E. Lawrence by his Friends\" (edited by A. W. Lawrence, London, Jonathan Cape, 1937).\n\nA substantial amount of income went directly to the RAF Benevolent Fund or for archaeological, environmental, or academic projects. The two trusts were amalgamated in 1986 and, on the death of Prof. A. W. Lawrence in 1991, the unified trust also acquired all the remaining rights to Lawrence's works that it had not owned, plus rights to all of Prof. Lawrence's works. The UK copyrights of Lawrence's works published in his lifetime and within 20 years of his death had expired by the end of 2005. Works published more than 20 years after his death were protected for 50 years from publication.\n\n\nLawrence's biographers have discussed his sexuality at considerable length, and this discussion has spilled into the popular press.\n\nThere is no reliable evidence for consensual sexual intimacy between Lawrence and any person. His friends have expressed the opinion that he was asexual, and Lawrence himself specifically denied, in multiple private letters, any personal experience of sex. There were suggestions that Lawrence had been intimate with Dahoum, who worked with him at a pre-war archaeological dig in Carchemish, and fellow-serviceman R. A. M. Guy, but his biographers and contemporaries have found them unconvincing.\n\nThe dedication to his book \"Seven Pillars\" is a poem titled \"To S.A.\" which opens:\nLawrence was never specific about the identity of \"S.A.\" Many theories argue in favour of individual men or women, and the Arab nation as a whole. The most popular theory is that S.A. represents (at least in part) his companion Selim Ahmed, \"Dahoum\"—who apparently died of typhus before 1918.\n\nLawrence lived in a period of strong official opposition to homosexuality, but his writing on the subject was tolerant. In a letter to Charlotte Shaw, he wrote, \"I've seen lots of man-and-man loves: very lovely and fortunate some of them were.\" He refers to \"the openness and honesty of perfect love\" on one occasion in \"Seven Pillars\", when discussing relationships between young male fighters in the war. In Chapter 1 of \"Seven Pillars\", he wrote:\n\nThere is considerable evidence that Lawrence was a masochist. In his description of the Dera'a beating, Lawrence wrote: \"a delicious warmth, probably sexual, was swelling through me,\" and also included a detailed description of the guards' whip in a style typical of masochists' writing. In later life, Lawrence arranged to pay a military colleague to administer beatings to him, and to be subjected to severe formal tests of fitness and stamina. John Bruce first wrote on this topic, including some other claims that were not credible, but Lawrence's biographers regard the beatings as established fact. The French novelist André Malraux, who admired Lawrence, wrote that he had a \"taste for self-humiliation, now by discipline and now by veneration; a horror of respectability; a disgust for possessions...a thoroughgoing sense of guilt, pursued by his angels or his demons, a sense of evil, and of the nothingness men cling to; a need for the absolute, an instinctive taste for asceticism\".\n\nPsychologist John E. Mack sees a possible connection between T. E.'s masochism and the childhood beatings that he had received from his mother for routine misbehaviours. His brother Arnold thought that the beatings had been given for the purpose of breaking T. E.'s will. Writing in 1997, Angus Calder noted that it is \"astonishing\" that earlier commentators discussing Lawrence's apparent masochism and self-loathing failed to consider the impact on Lawrence of having lost his brothers Frank and Will on the Western Front, along with many other school friends.\n\nLawrence was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the French Légion d'honneur—though in October 1918 he declined appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nA bronze bust of Lawrence by Eric Kennington was placed in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, London, on 29 January 1936, alongside the tombs of Britain's greatest military leaders. A recumbent stone effigy by Kennington was installed in St Martin's Church, Wareham, Dorset, in 1939.\n\nAn English Heritage blue plaque marks Lawrence's childhood home at 2 Polstead Road, Oxford, and another appears on his London home at 14 Barton Street, Westminster. Lawrence appears on the album cover of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" by The Beatles. In 2002, Lawrence was named 53rd in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Michener, first published in 1965. It is a survey of the history of the Jewish people and the land of Israel from pre-monotheistic days to the birth of the modern State of Israel. \"The Source\" uses, for its central device, a fictional \"tell\" in northern Israel called \"Makor\" (). Prosaically, the name comes from a freshwater well just north of Makock, but symbolically it stands for much more, historically and spiritually.\n\nUnlike most Michener novels, this book is not in strict chronological order. A parallel frame story set in Israel in the 1960s supports the historical timeline. Archaeologists digging at the \"tell\" at Makor uncover artifacts from each layer, which then serve as the basis for a chapter exploring the lives of the people involved with that artifact. The book follows the story of the Family of Ur from a Stone Age family whose wife begins to believe that there is a supernatural force, which slowly leads us to the beginnings of monotheism. The descendants are not aware of the ancient antecedents revealed to the reader by the all-knowing writer as the story progresses through the Davidic kingdom, Hellenistic times, Roman times, etc. The site is continually inhabited until the end of the Crusades when it is destroyed by the victorious Mameluks (as happened to many actual cities after 1291) and is not rebuilt by the Ottomans.\n\n\nIn the early civilizations, the concept of fertility sprouts from agriculture and the desire for a fruitful harvest. During the earliest layer of history, the giant stone idol named El is created to please the earth and bring good crops.\n\nAs society moves away from a rural and agricultural existence, fertility is given less and less importance. The phallic is present from the Stone Age (\"The Bee Eater\"), until 606 BCE (\"The Voice of Gomer\").\n\nLater, as modern Judaism begins to take form, the theme of dedication and tenacity is brought forward again and again. The final words of many of the book's characters are of prayer; they are defending their religion with their life. As anti-semitism becomes more prevalent, this theme grows stronger, as if to show the strength of the faith that the Jewish people hold.\n\n"}

{"id": "33684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33684", "title": "W. B. Yeats", "text": "W. B. Yeats\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats (13 June 186528 January 1939) was an Irish poet and one of the foremost figures of 20th-century literature. A pillar of the Irish literary establishment, he helped to found the Abbey Theatre, and in his later years served as a Senator of the Irish Free State for two terms. He was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival along with Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and others.\n\nYeats was born in Sandymount, Ireland and educated there and in London. He spent childhood holidays in County Sligo and studied poetry from an early age when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and realistic. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life. In 1923, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nWilliam Butler Yeats was born at Sandymount in County Dublin, Ireland. His father, John Butler Yeats (1839–1922), was a descendant of Jervis Yeats, a Williamite soldier, linen merchant, and well-known painter who died in 1712. Benjamin Yeats, Jervis's grandson and William's great-great-grandfather, had in 1773 married Mary Butler of a landed family in County Kildare. Following their marriage, they kept the name Butler. Mary was a descendant of the Butler of Ormond family from the Neigham (pronounced Nyam) Gowran branch.\n\nBy his marriage, William's father John Yeats was studying law but abandoned his studies to study art at Heatherley School of Fine Art in London. His mother, Susan Mary Pollexfen, came from a wealthy merchant family in Sligo, who owned a milling and shipping business. Soon after William's birth the family relocated to the Pollexfen home at Merville, Sligo to stay with her extended family, and the young poet came to think of the area as his childhood and spiritual home. Its landscape became, over time, both literally and symbolically, his \"country of the heart\". So also did its location on the sea; John Yeats stated that \"by marriage with a Pollexfen, we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs\". The Butler Yeats family were highly artistic; his brother Jack became an esteemed painter, while his sisters Elizabeth and Susan Mary—known to family and friends as Lollie and Lily—became involved in the Arts and Crafts movement.\n\nYeats was raised a member of the Protestant Ascendancy, which was at the time undergoing a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage, and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man you have to know what was happening in the world when he was twenty \"is manifestly true of W.B.Y.\" Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.\n\nIn 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales. John provided an erratic education in geography and chemistry, and took William on natural history explorations of the nearby Slough countryside. On 26 January 1877, the young poet entered the Godolphin school, which he attended for four years. He did not distinguish himself academically, and an early school report describes his performance as \"only fair. Perhaps better in Latin than in any other subject. Very poor in spelling\". Though he had difficulty with mathematics and languages (possibly because he was tone deaf), he was fascinated by biology and zoology. In 1879 the family moved to Bedford Park taking a two-year lease on 8 Woodstock Road. For financial reasons, the family returned to Dublin toward the end of 1880, living at first in the suburbs of Harold's Cross and later Howth. In October 1881, Yeats resumed his education at Dublin's Erasmus Smith High School. His father's studio was nearby and William spent a great deal of time there, where he met many of the city's artists and writers. During this period he started writing poetry, and, in 1885, the \"Dublin University Review\" published Yeats's first poems, as well as an essay entitled \"The Poetry of Sir Samuel Ferguson\". Between 1884 and 1886, William attended the Metropolitan School of Art—now the National College of Art and Design—in Thomas Street. In March 1888 the family moved to 3 Blenheim Road in Bedford Park. The rent on the house was £50 a year. \n\nHe began writing his first works when he was seventeen; these included a poem—heavily influenced by Percy Bysshe Shelley—that describes a magician who set up a throne in central Asia. Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop, a monk, and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds, as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and, according to the critic Charles Johnston, \"utterly unIrish\", seeming to come out of a \"vast murmurous gloom of dreams\". Although Yeats's early works drew heavily on Shelley, Edmund Spenser, and on the diction and colouring of pre-Raphaelite verse, he soon turned to Irish mythology and folklore and the writings of William Blake. In later life, Yeats paid tribute to Blake by describing him as one of the \"great artificers of God who uttered great truths to a little clan\". In 1891, Yeats published \"John Sherman\" and \"Dhoya\", one a novella, the other a story.\n\nThe family returned to London in 1887. In March 1890 Yeats joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and with Ernest Rhys co-founded the Rhymers' Club, a group of London-based poets who met regularly in a Fleet Street tavern to recite their verse. Yeats later sought to mythologize the collective, calling it the \"Tragic Generation\" in his autobiography, and published two anthologies of the Rhymers' work, the first one in 1892 and the second one in 1894. He collaborated with Edwin Ellis on the first complete edition of William Blake's works, in the process rediscovering a forgotten poem, \"Vala, or, the Four Zoas\".\n\nYeats had a life-long interest in mysticism, spiritualism, occultism and astrology. He read extensively on the subjects throughout his life, became a member of the paranormal research organisation \"The Ghost Club\" (in 1911) and was especially influenced by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. As early as 1892, he wrote: \"If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book, nor would \"The Countess Kathleen\" ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of all that I do and all that I think and all that I write.\" His mystical interests—also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee, and the occult—formed much of the basis of his late poetry. Some critics disparaged this aspect of Yeats's work.\n\nHis first significant poem was \"The Island of Statues\", a fantasy work that took Edmund Spenser and Shelley for its poetic models. The piece was serialized in the \"Dublin University Review\". Yeats wished to include it in his first collection, but it was deemed too long, and in fact was never republished in his lifetime. Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet \"Mosada: A Dramatic Poem\" (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection \"The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems\" (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long title poem contains, in the words of his biographer R. F. Foster, \"obscure Gaelic names, striking repetitions [and] an unremitting rhythm subtly varied as the poem proceeded through its three sections\";\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">We rode in sorrow, with strong hounds three,\nBran, Sceolan, and Lomair,\nOn a morning misty and mild and fair.\nThe mist-drops hung on the fragrant trees,\nAnd in the blossoms hung the bees.\nWe rode in sadness above Lough Lean,\nFor our best were dead on Gavra's green.</poem>\n\n\"The Wanderings of Oisin\" is based on the lyrics of the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology and displays the influence of both Sir Samuel Ferguson and the Pre-Raphaelite poets. The poem took two years to complete and was one of the few works from this period that he did not disown in his maturity. \"Oisin\" introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include \"Poems\" (1895), \"The Secret Rose\" (1897), and \"The Wind Among the Reeds\" (1899). The covers of these volumes were illustrated by Yeats's friend Althea Gyles.\n\nDuring 1885, Yeats was involved in the formation of the Dublin Hermetic Order. The society held its first meeting on 16 June, with Yeats acting as its chairman. The same year, the Dublin Theosophical lodge was opened in conjunction with Brahmin Mohini Chatterjee, who travelled from the Theosophical Society in London to lecture. Yeats attended his first séance the following year. He later became heavily involved with the Theosophy and with hermeticism, particularly with the eclectic Rosicrucianism of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. During séances held from 1912, a spirit calling itself \"Leo Africanus\" apparently claimed it was Yeats's \"Daemon\" or anti-self, inspiring some of the speculations in \"Per Amica Silentia Lunae\". He was admitted into the Golden Dawn in March 1890 and took the magical motto \"\"—translated as 'Devil is God inverted'. He was an active recruiter for the sect's Isis-Urania Temple, and brought in his uncle George Pollexfen, Maud Gonne, and Florence Farr. Although he reserved a distaste for abstract and dogmatic religions founded around personality cults, he was attracted to the type of people he met at the Golden Dawn. He was involved in the Order's power struggles, both with Farr and Macgregor Mathers, and was involved when Mathers sent Aleister Crowley to repossess Golden Dawn paraphernalia during the \"Battle of Blythe Road\". After the Golden Dawn ceased and splintered into various offshoots, Yeats remained with the Stella Matutina until 1921.\n\nIn 1889, Yeats met Maud Gonne, a 23-year-old English heiress and ardent Irish Nationalist. She was eighteen months younger than Yeats and later claimed she met the poet as a \"paint-stained art student.\" Gonne admired \"The Island of Statues\" and sought out his acquaintance. Yeats began an obsessive infatuation, and she had a significant and lasting effect on his poetry and his life thereafter. In later years he admitted, \"it seems to me that she [Gonne] brought into my life those days—for as yet I saw only what lay upon the surface—the middle of the tint, a sound as of a Burmese gong, an over-powering tumult that had yet many pleasant secondary notes.\" Yeats's love was unrequited, in part due to his reluctance to participate in her nationalist activism.\n\nIn 1891 he visited Gonne in Ireland and proposed marriage, but was rejected. He later admitted that from that point \"the troubling of my life began\". Yeats proposed to Gonne three more times: in 1899, 1900 and 1901. She refused each proposal, and in 1903, to his dismay, married the Irish nationalist Major John MacBride. His only other love affair during this period was with Olivia Shakespear, whom he first met in 1894, and parted from in 1897.\n\nYeats derided MacBride in letters and in poetry. He was horrified by Gonne's marriage, at losing his muse to another man; in addition, her conversion to Catholicism before marriage offended him; Yeats was Protestant/agnostic. He worried his muse would come under the influence of the priests and do their bidding.\n\nGonne's marriage to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began to visit him in London. After the birth of her son, Seán MacBride, in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">My arms are like the twisted thorn\nAnd yet there beauty lay;\nThe first of all the tribe lay there\nAnd did such pleasure take;\nShe who had brought great Hector down\nAnd put all Troy to wreck.</poem>\n\nIn 1896, Yeats was introduced to Lady Gregory by their mutual friend Edward Martyn. Gregory encouraged Yeats's nationalism, and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French Symbolism, Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory, Martyn, and other writers including J. M. Synge, Seán O'Casey, and Padraic Colum, Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the \"Irish Literary Revival\" movement. Apart from these creative writers, much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was Douglas Hyde, later the first President of Ireland, whose \"Love Songs of Connacht\" was widely admired.\n\nIn 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and George Moore began the Irish Literary Theatre to present Irish plays. The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the \"ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager \"à l'anglais\".\" The group's manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, \"We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted & imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory ... & that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England, & without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed.\"\n\nThe collective survived for about two years but was not successful. Working with two Irish brothers with theatrical experience, William and Frank Fay, Yeats's unpaid yet independently wealthy secretary Annie Horniman, and the leading West End actress Florence Farr, the group established the Irish National Theatre Society. Along with Synge, they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the Abbey Theatre. Yeats's play \"Cathleen ni Houlihan\" and Lady Gregory's \"Spreading the News\" were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the Dun Emer Press to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the Cuala Press in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to \"find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things.\" From then until its closure in 1946, the press—which was run by the poet's sisters—produced over 70 titles; 48 of them books by Yeats himself.\n\nYeats met the American poet Ezra Pound in 1909. Pound had travelled to London at least partly to meet the older man, whom he considered \"the only poet worthy of serious study.\" From that year until 1916, the two men wintered in the Stone Cottage at Ashdown Forest, with Pound nominally acting as Yeats's secretary. The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine \"Poetry\" of some of Yeats's verse with Pound's own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pound's distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese Noh plays that Pound had obtained from Ernest Fenollosa's widow, which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write. The first of his plays modelled on Noh was \"At the Hawk's Well\", the first draft of which he dictated to Pound in January 1916.\n\nThe emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of \"Easter, 1916\" (\"All changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty is born\"), Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the Easter Rising, due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives.\n\nYeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, \"The Wild Swans at Coole\" was written there, between 1916 and 1917.\n\nHe wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales, compiled by Augusta, Lady Gregory: \"Cuchulain of Muirthemne\" (1902), and \"Gods and Fighting Men\" (1904). In the preface of the later he wrote: \"One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne, or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne.\"\n\nYeats was an Irish Nationalist, who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as 'The Fisherman'. However, as his life progressed, he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the intense political landscape until 1922, when he was appointed Senator for the Irish Free State.\n\nIn the earlier part of his life, Yeats was a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Due to the escalating tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the Easter Rising, even holding back his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.\n\nIn the 1930s Yeats was fascinated with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, nationalist movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the far right Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism, and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian and nationalist leadership.\n\nBy 1916, Yeats was 51 years old and determined to marry and produce an heir. His rival John MacBride had been executed for his role in the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry. His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne's history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her life—including chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife; biographer R. F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.\n\nYeats proposed in an indifferent manner, with conditions attached, and he both expected and hoped she would turn him down. According to Foster \"when he duly asked Maud to marry him, and was duly refused, his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter.\" Iseult Gonne was Maud's second child with Lucien Millevoye, and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother, for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mother's adopted niece. When Maud told her that she was going to marry, Iseult cried and told her mother that she hated MacBride. When Gonne took action to divorce MacBride in 1905, the court heard allegations that he had sexually assaulted Iseult, then eleven. At fifteen, she proposed to Yeats. In 1917, he proposed to Iseult, but was rejected.\n\nThat September, Yeats proposed to 25-year-old Georgie Hyde-Lees (1892–1968), known as George, whom he had met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friends—\"George ... you can't. He must be dead\"—Hyde-Lees accepted, and the two were married on 20 October. Their marriage was a success, in spite of the age difference, and in spite of Yeats's feelings of remorse and regret during their honeymoon. The couple went on to have two children, Anne and Michael. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband \"When you are dead, people will talk about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were.\"\n\nDuring the first years of marriage, they experimented with automatic writing; she contacted a variety of spirits and guides they called \"Instructors\" while in a trance. The spirits communicated a complex and esoteric system of philosophy and history, which the couple developed into an exposition using geometrical shapes: phases, cones, and gyres. Yeats devoted much time to preparing this material for publication as \"A Vision\" (1925). In 1924, he wrote to his publisher T. Werner Laurie, admitting: \"I dare say I delude myself in thinking this book my book of books\".\n\nIn December 1923, Yeats was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for his always inspired poetry, which in a highly artistic form gives expression to the spirit of a whole nation\". He was aware of the symbolic value of an Irish winner so soon after Ireland had gained independence, and sought to highlight the fact at each available opportunity. His reply to many of the letters of congratulations sent to him contained the words: \"I consider that this honour has come to me less as an individual than as a representative of Irish literature, it is part of Europe's welcome to the Free State.\"\n\nYeats used the occasion of his acceptance lecture at the Royal Academy of Sweden to present himself as a standard-bearer of Irish nationalism and Irish cultural independence. As he remarked, \"The theatres of Dublin were empty buildings hired by the English traveling companies, and we wanted Irish plays and Irish players. When we thought of these plays we thought of everything that was romantic and poetical, because the nationalism we had called up—the nationalism every generation had called up in moments of discouragement—was romantic and poetical.\" The prize led to a significant increase in the sales of his books, as his publishers Macmillan sought to capitalise on the publicity. For the first time he had money, and he was able to repay not only his own debts, but those of his father.\n\nBy early 1925, Yeats's health had stabilised, and he had completed most of the writing for \"A Vision\" (dated 1925, it actually appeared in January 1926, when he almost immediately started rewriting it for a second version). He had been appointed to the first Irish Senate in 1922, and was re-appointed for a second term in 1925. Early in his tenure, a debate on divorce arose, and Yeats viewed the issue as primarily a confrontation between the emerging Roman Catholic ethos and the Protestant minority. When the Roman Catholic Church weighed in with a blanket refusal to consider their anti position, \"The Irish Times\" countered that a measure to outlaw divorce would alienate Protestants and \"crystallise\" the partition of Ireland.\n\nIn response, Yeats delivered a series of speeches that attacked the \"quixotically impressive\" ambitions of the government and clergy, likening their campaign tactics to those of \"medieval Spain.\" \"Marriage is not to us a Sacrament, but, upon the other hand, the love of a man and woman, and the inseparable physical desire, are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature, and it seems to us a most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people who hate each other... to live together, and it is to us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry.\" The resulting debate has been described as one of Yeats's \"supreme public moments\", and began his ideological move away from pluralism towards religious confrontation.\nHis language became more forceful; the Jesuit Father Peter Finlay was described by Yeats as a man of \"monstrous discourtesy\", and he lamented that, \"It is one of the glories of the Church in which I was born that we have put our Bishops in their place in discussions requiring legislation\". During his time in the Senate, Yeats further warned his colleagues: \"If you show that this country, southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, you will never get the North... You will put a wedge in the midst of this nation\". He memorably said of his fellow Irish Protestants, \"we are no petty people\".\n\nIn 1924, he chaired a coinage committee charged with selecting a set of designs for the first currency of the Irish Free State. Aware of the symbolic power latent in the imagery of a young state's currency, he sought a form that was \"elegant, racy of the soil, and utterly unpolitical\". When the house finally decided on the artwork of Percy Metcalfe, Yeats was pleased, though he regretted that compromise had led to \"lost muscular tension\" in the finally depicted images. He retired from the Senate in 1928 because of ill health.\n\nTowards the end of his life—and especially after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and Great Depression, which led some to question whether democracy could cope with deep economic difficulty—Yeats seems to have returned to his aristocratic sympathies. During the aftermath of the First World War, he became sceptical about the efficacy of democratic government, and anticipated political reconstruction in Europe through totalitarian rule. His later association with Pound drew him towards Benito Mussolini, for whom he expressed admiration on a number of occasions. He wrote three \"marching songs\"—never used—for the Irish General Eoin O'Duffy's Blueshirts.\n\nAt the age of 69 he was 'rejuvenated' by the Steinach operation which was performed on 6 April 1934 by Norman Haire. For the last five years of his life Yeats found a new vigour evident from both his poetry and his intimate relations with younger women. During this time, Yeats was involved in a number of romantic affairs with, among others, the poet and actress Margot Ruddock, and the novelist, journalist and sexual radical Ethel Mannin. As in his earlier life, Yeats found erotic adventure conducive to his creative energy, and, despite age and ill-health, he remained a prolific writer. In a letter of 1935, Yeats noted: \"I find my present weakness made worse by the strange second puberty the operation has given me, the ferment that has come upon my imagination. If I write poetry it will be unlike anything I have done\". In 1936, he undertook editorship of the \"Oxford Book of Modern Verse, 1892–1935\".\n\nHe died at the Hôtel Idéal Séjour, in Menton, France, on 28 January 1939, aged 73. He was buried after a discreet and private funeral at Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. Attempts had been made at Roquebrune to dissuade the family from proceeding with the removal of the remains to Ireland due to the uncertainty of their identity. His body had earlier been exhumed and transferred to the ossuary. Yeats and George had often discussed his death, and his express wish was that he be buried quickly in France with a minimum of fuss. According to George, \"His actual words were 'If I die bury me up there [at Roquebrune] and then in a year's time when the newspapers have forgotten me, dig me up and plant me in Sligo'.\" In September 1948, Yeats's body was moved to the churchyard of St Columba's Church, Drumcliff, County Sligo, on the Irish Naval Service corvette \"LÉ Macha\". The person in charge of this operation for the Irish Government was Seán MacBride, son of Maud Gonne MacBride, and then Minister of External Affairs. His epitaph is taken from the last lines of \"Under Ben Bulben\", one of his final poems:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">Cast a cold Eye\nOn Life, on Death.\nHorseman, pass by!</poem>\n\nFrench ambassador Stanislas Ostroróg was involved in returning the remains of the Irish poet from France to Ireland in 1948; in a letter to the European director of the Foreign Ministry in Paris \"Ostrorog tells how Yeats’s son Michael sought official help in locating the poet’s remains. Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride, the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony, wanted to know the details of how the remains were collected, Ostrorog notes. He repeatedly urges caution and discretion and says the Irish ambassador in Paris should not be informed.\" Yeats' body was exhumed in 1946 and the remains were moved to on ossuary and mixed with other remains. The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried about the fact that the much-loved poet's remains were thrown into a communal grave, causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France. \"Mr Rebouillat, (a) forensic doctor in Roquebrune would be able to reconstitute a skeleton presenting all the characteristics of the deceased.\" per a letter from Ostroróg to his superiors.\n\nYeats is generally considered one of the twentieth century key English language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.\n\nUnlike other modernists who experimented with free verse, Yeats was a master of the traditional forms. The impact of modernism on his work can be seen in the increasing abandonment of the more conventionally poetic diction of his early work in favour of the more austere language and more direct approach to his themes that increasingly characterises the poetry and plays of his middle period, comprising the volumes \"In the Seven Woods\", \"Responsibilities\" and \"The Green Helmet\". His later poetry and plays are written in a more personal vein, and the works written in the last twenty years of his life include mention of his son and daughter, as well as meditations on the experience of growing old. In his poem, \"The Circus Animals' Desertion\", he describes the inspiration for these late works:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">Now that my ladder's gone\nI must lie down where all the ladders start\nIn the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.</poem>\n\nDuring 1929, he stayed at Thoor Ballylee near Gort in County Galway (where Yeats had his summer home since 1919) for the last time. Much of the remainder of his life was lived outside Ireland, although he did lease Riversdale house in the Dublin suburb of Rathfarnham in 1932. He wrote prolifically through his final years, and published poetry, plays, and prose. In 1938, he attended the Abbey for the final time to see the premiere of his play \"Purgatory\". His \"Autobiographies of William Butler Yeats\" was published that same year. In 1913, Yeats wrote the preface for the English translation of Rabindranath Tagore's \"Gitanjali (Song Offering)\" for which Tagore received Nobel Prize in literature.\nWhile Yeats's early poetry drew heavily on Irish myth and folklore, his later work was engaged with more contemporary issues, and his style underwent a dramatic transformation. His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as \"The Isle of Statues\" and \"The Wanderings of Oisin\". His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work and attempt to turn himself into a Landor-style social ironist.\n\nCritics who admire his middle work might characterize it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of \"The Wanderings of Oisin\", is reproduced in \"A Dialogue Between Self and Soul\".\n\nSome critics claim that Yeats spanned the transition from the nineteenth century into twentieth-century modernism in poetry much as Pablo Picasso did in painting while others question whether late Yeats has much in common with modernists of the Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot variety.\n\nModernists read the well-known poem \"The Second Coming\" as a dirge for the decline of European civilisation, but it also expresses Yeats's apocalyptic mystical theories, and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with \"The Green Helmet\" (1910) and \"Responsibilities\" (1914). In imagery, Yeats's poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. \"The Tower\" (1928), \"The Winding Stair\" (1933), and \"New Poems\" (1938) contained some of the most potent images in twentieth-century poetry.\n\nYeats's mystical inclinations, informed by Hinduism, theosophical beliefs and the occult, provided much of the basis of his late poetry, which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility. The metaphysics of Yeats's late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in \"A Vision\" (1925).\n\nYeats is commemorated in Sligo town by a statue, created in 1989 by sculptor Ronan Gillespie. It was erected outside the Ulster Bank, at the corner of Stephen Street and Markievicz Road, on the 50th anniversary of the poet’s death. Yeats had remarked, on receiving his Nobel Prize that the Royal Palace in Stockholm \"resembled the Ulster Bank in Sligo\". Across the river is the Yeats Memorial Building, home to the Sligo Yeats Society.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a chaplain to the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, whose biography he wrote in chronicle form, \"Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris\". Present at the election of Conrad II, he most likely followed the emperor on his campaigns into Burgundy (1033) and against the Slavs (1035), both of which he wrote with extensive clarity.\n\nHe presented his work to Conrad’s son Henry III in 1046, not long after Henry was crowned. In this Wipo fully understands his subject, is fresh and animated, and, although affectionate, is not a mere eulogist or a flatterer, for he sees Conrad’s failings clearly. But he does not fully grasp the general conditions of the age, especially the emperor’s manifold relations to the ruling princes and the Church. His style is simple and fluent, and his language well-chosen.\n\nHe mentioned Henry’s younger sister Matilda as a fiancée of King Henry I of France and records her death and burial at Worms, Germany in 1034.\n\nAmong his other extant writings are the maxims, \"Proverbia\" (1027 or 1028), and \"Tetralogus Heinrici\" in rhymed hexameters. Presented to Henry in 1041, it is a eulogy of the emperor mixed with earnest exhortations, emphasizing that right and law are the real foundations of the throne. He wrote a lament in Latin on Conrad’s death, and is believed to have written the famous sequence for Easter, \"Victimae paschali laudes\" (though the attribution of this chant to Wipo is uncertain).\n\n"}

It is argued that in the twentieth century women art historians (and curators), by choosing to study women artists, \"dramatically\" \"increased their visibility\". In fact, women art historians are one of two groups (besides authors of high-school texbooks) \"who say there have been great women artists\" in the first place, according to the authors of a study of the representations of women artists in US textbooks.\n\nIn the United States professional, academic employment for women art historians was, by the early 1970s, not commensurate with the number of female PhDs in art history. Between 1960 and 1969, 30.1% of PhDs were awarded to women but those numbers increased significantly during that period: between 1960 and 1965 it was 27%, but between 1966 and 1967 it had gone up to 43.5%. But in 1970-1971, women art historians in art departments in the US made up 23.1% of instructors, 21.6% of assistant professors, 17.5% of associate professors, and only 11.1% of full professors. Comparison with the numbers for the same years for women in the languages, from a study done by the Modern Language Association, showed that \"women in C.A.A. [College Art Association] professions face[d] rather more severe discrimination than women in M.L.A. fields\". Similar tendencies were reported for salary and employment in studio teaching (\"preliminary statistics...indicate that women artists receive a disproportionately small share of full-time studio jobs\") and in museums (\"particularly significant was a tendency to hire women with BAs to be secretaries and men with BAs for trainee programs which rapidly advanced them to more challenging positions).\n\nThe history of women in the profession also suggests that art education itself has benefited from the increased presence of professional women art historians, since women students sometimes found it necessary to \"redo\" an education in which only a male point of view had been provided given. Paula Harper, \"one of the first art historians to bring a feminist perspective to the study of painting and sculpture\", and Moira Roth shared the same experience of a \"one-sided training\", of feeling left out. Discrimination against \"women in college and university art departments and art museums\" was, in the early 1970s, the immediate cause for the foundation of the Women's Caucus for Art (see below).\n\nIn a statistical study of US employment among art faculties published in 1977, Sandra Packard notes that \"in art departments women have been decreasing in number since the 1930's\", and that the number of women in art faculties at institutes of higher education \"decreas[ed] from 22% in 1963 to a low of 19.5% in 1974\", and cites statistics suggesting that \"although women are concentrated at the lower ranks in art faculties, they have more Ph.D. degrees than their male colleagues.\"\n\nThe Women's Caucus for Art (WCA), a caucus for woman art historians, artists, and curators was founded at the 1972 meeting of the College Art Association (CAA), but re-established itself as an independent organization in 1974 after the CAA told them they could not use the CAA name anymore. According to Judith Brodsky, the CAA was, at the time, very much a male-dominated organization; she notes, though, in a 1977 article that the Caucus is given space and time at the annual CAA conference and in the CAA's journal, \"Art Journal\". A Lifetime Achievement Award was installed in 1979. The organization's objectives include \"providing women with leadership opportunities and professional development\" and \"expanding networking and exhibition opportunities for women\", and to that purpose publishes a newsletter, organizes sessions at conferences, and runs databases for \"art and activism\". In 2012 the WCA celebrated its 40th anniversary, and published a pamphlet for the annual awards ceremony that also includes a number of historical essays and reflections from the past presidents.\n\nFeminist scholars have argued that the role of women art historians is connected to the study of women (as artists and as subjects) by art historians. In 1974, Lise Vogel noted that there were few feminist art historians, and that women art historians in general seemed unwilling to ask \"the more radical critiques\" a feminist scholar should engage in. In a 1998 essay, Corine Schleif argued that women and feminist scholars need to challenge the \"Great Master\" canon, and that they need to focus less on \"style as evidence of authorship\", seen as a traditionally masculine way of viewing the history of art, but rather on style as \"one of many sites on the production of meaning\". The topic of women scholars in art history is thus intricately connected with what scholars have called feminist art theory; Kerry Freedman, for example, claims that \"women art historians often interpret art that is about and by women differently than their male colleagues\". However, Carol Armstrong and Catherine de Zegher, in \"Women artists at the millennium\" (2006), argue that by the 1980s many \"women art history scholars\" had begun to think of feminism as irrelevant to the discipline.\n"}

It served as the capital of the pre-Aksumite kingdom of D'mt.\n\nThe oldest standing structure in Ethiopia, the Temple of Yeha, is located in Yeha. This is a tower built in the Sabaean style, and dated through comparison with ancient structures in South Arabia to around 700 BC. Although no radiocarbon dating testing has been performed on samples from site, this date for the Great Tower is supported by local inscriptions. David Phillipson attributes its \"excellent preservation\" to two factors, \"the care with which its original builders ensured a level foundation, firmly placed on the uneven bedrock; and to its rededication -- perhaps as early as the sixth century AD -- for use as a Christian church.\" Two other archaeological sites at Yeha include Grat Beal Gebri, a ruined complex distinguished by a portico 10 meters wide and two sets of square pillars, and a graveyard containing several rock-hewn shaft tombs first investigated in the early 1960s. One authority has speculated that one of these tombs contained a royal burial, while another believes the ancient residential area was likely one kilometer to the east of the modern village.\n\nAdditionally, Yeha is the location of an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church monastery. The edifice was founded according to tradition by Abba Aftse, one of the Nine Saints. In his account of Ethiopia, Francisco Álvares mentions visiting this town in 1520 (which he called \"Abbafaçem\"), and provides a description of the ancient tower, the monastery, and the local church. This church was either the rededicated Great Temple, or a now destroyed building which the Deutsche Aksum-Expedition described in the early 20th century. (The current structure, which exhibits Aksumite architectural features, was built between 1948 and 1949.)\n\nThe Central Statistical Agency has not published an estimate for this village's 2005 population.\n\nYeha has also been the site of a number of archaeological excavations, beginning in 1952 by the Ethiopian Institute of Archeology. Although interrupted during the Derg regime, excavations were resumed in 1993 by a French archaeological team.\n\n"}
