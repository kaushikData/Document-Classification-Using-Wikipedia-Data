{"id": "21371767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21371767", "title": "Abidjan", "text": "Abidjan\n\nAbidjan () is the economic capital of Ivory Coast and one of the most populous French-speaking cities in Africa. According to the 2014 census, Abidjan's population was 4.7 million, which is 20 percent of the overall population of the country, and this also makes it the fourth most populous city proper in Africa, after Lagos, Cairo and Kinshasa. A cultural crossroads of West Africa, Abidjan is characterised by a high level of industrialisation and urbanisation.\n\nThe city expanded quickly after the construction of a new wharf in 1931, followed by its designation as the capital city of the then-French colony in 1933. Abidjan remained the capital of Côte d'Ivoire after its independence from France in 1960. The completion of the Vridi Canal in 1951 enabled Abidjan to become an important sea port. In 1983, the city of Yamoussoukro was designated as the official political capital of Cote d'Ivoire. However, almost all political institutions and foreign embassies continue to be located in Abidjan.\n\nBecause Abidjan is also the largest city in the country and the centre of its economic activity, it has officially been designated as the \"economic capital\" of the country. The Abidjan Autonomous District, which encompasses the city and some of its suburbs, is one of the 14 districts of Côte d'Ivoire.\n\nAbidjan lies on the south-east coast of the country, on the Gulf of Guinea. The city is located on the Ébrié Lagoon. The business district, Le Plateau, is the center of the city, along with Cocody, Deux Plateaux (the city's wealthiest neighborhood and a hub for diplomats), and Adjamé, a slum on the north shore of the lagoon. Treichville and Marcory lie to the south, Attecoube, Locodjro, Abobo Doume and Yopougon to the west, and Île Boulay is located in the middle of the lagoon. Further south lies Port Bouët, home to the airport and main seaport. Abidjan is located at 5°25′ North, 4°2′ West (5.41667, −4.03333).\n\nAbidjan experiences a tropical wet and dry climate (\"Aw\"), according to the Köppen climate classification. Abidjan has nonconsecutive rainy seasons (precipitation above with a long rainy season from March to July and a short rainy season from September to December, and three dry months (January, February and August). Precipitation is abundant during the summer months, except for August, due to activation of the Benguela Current, which reduces the precipitation total throughout the month. The Benguela Current also lowers the mean temperature during August, making it the coolest month of the year, averaging . Abidjan has two additional dry months (January and February). Abidjan is generally humid, with average relative humidity above 80% throughout the year.\n\nAbidjan is composed of northern Abidjan and southern Abidjan. Each has ten formal boroughs, or communes, each being run by a mayor.\n\n\n\nTowns near Abidjan include Jacqueville, Grand-Lahou and Dabou in the west; Sikensi, Tiassalé, Agboville, Adzopé and Alépé in the north; and Grand-Bassam to the east.\n\nThe towns (or sub-prefectures) of Anyama, Bingerville, Brofodoumé and Songon are within the Abidjan Department, which is co-extensive with the autonomous district.\n\nAccording to oral tradition of the Tchaman as reported in the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Côte d'Ivoire, the name \"Abidjan\" results from a misunderstanding. Legend states that an old man carrying branches to repair the roof of his house met a European explorer who asked him the name of the nearest village. The old man did not speak the language of the explorer, and thought that he was being asked to justify his presence in that place. Terrified by this unexpected meeting, he fled shouting \"min-chan m'bidjan\", which means in the Ébrié language: \"I just cut the leaves.\" The explorer, thinking that his question had been answered, recorded the name of the locale as \"Abidjan\".\n\nA slightly different and less elaborate version of the legend: When the first colonists asked a native man the name of the place, the man misunderstood and replied \"M'bi min djan\": \"I've just been cutting leaves\".\n\nAbidjan was originally a small Atchan fishing village. In 1896, following a series of deadly yellow fever epidemics, French colonists who had initially settled in Grand-Bassam decided to move to a safer place and in 1898 chose the current location of Abidjan. In 1903 it officially became a town. The settlers were followed by the colonial government, created in 1899. But then nearby Bingerville became the capital of the French colony, from 1900 until 1934.\n\nThe future Abidjan, situated on the edge of the \"lagoon n'doupé\" (\"the lagoon in hot water\"), offered more land and greater opportunities for trade expansion. The wharf in Petit Bassam (now Port-Bouet) south of town quickly overtook the wharf of Grand-Bassam in importance, and became the main point of economic access to the colony. In 1904, the rail terminus was located in the Port-Bouet area of Abidjan. Starting in 1904, when Bingerville was not yet complete, Abidjan became the main economic hub of the colony of Ivory Coast and a prime channel for distributing products to the European hinterland, particularly through the Lebanese community, which was increasing in importance.\n\nIn 1931, Plateau and what would become Treichville were connected by a floating bridge, more or less where the Houphouët-Boigny Bridge stands today. The year 1931 also saw addresses begin to be assigned to the streets of Abidjan for the first time. The addressing project was temporarily concluded in 1964, under the leadership of Mayor Konan Kanga, then badly redone American-style in 1993.\n\nAbidjan became the third capital of Ivory Coast by a 1934 decree, following Grand-Bassam and Bingerville. Several villages in Tchaman were then deserted. The leader of the Tchaman community can still be found in Adjame (\"center\" or \"meeting\" in Tchaman), north of the Plateau.\n\nSouth of the Plateau district (the current central district of the city of Abidjan), the village of \"Dugbeo\" was moved across the lagoon to Anoumabo, \"the forest of fruit bats\", which became the neighborhood of Treichville (now known as Commikro, city of clerks). Treichville was renamed in 1934, in honour of Marcel Treich-Laplénie (1860–1890), the first explorer of the Ivory Coast and its first colonial administrator, considered its founder. Instead of Dugbeyo, is the current Treich-Laplénie Avenue, the bus station and water lagoon buses in Plateau, and the Avenue Charles de Gaulle (commonly called Rue du Commerce).\n\nThe city was laid out like most colonial towns, on a grid plan. Le Plateau (\"m'brato\" in Tchaman) were inhabited by settlers. In the north, the city was inhabited by the colonized. The two zones were separated by the Gallieni Military Barracks, where now there is the current courthouse.\n\nNear the port, originally named Boulevard de Marseille, settlers became defensive and stole a street sign of a famous street of Marseille renamed the street Canebière, a sand track. This is the legend behind the first Blohorn oil mills, in Cocody and a racetrack was built in the south of the city.\n\nIn Le Plateau in the 1940s, the Bardon Park Hotel was built, the first air-conditioned hotel working in francophone Africa.\n\nAbidjan's lagoon became connected to the sea once the 15m-deep canal was completed in 1950. Soon Abidjan became the financial center of West Africa. In 1958, the first bridge to connect Petit-Bassam Island with the mainland was completed.\n\nWhen Côte d’Ivoire became independent in 1960, Abidjan became the new country’s administrative and economic center. The axis south of Treichville, towards the international airport and the beaches, became the heart of European and middle-class Abidjan. The city saw considerable population growth in the decades following independence, expanding from 180,000 inhabitants in 1960 to 1,269,000 in 1978. Abidjan’s skyline dates back to the economic prosperity of this period.\n\nNew districts such as the upmarket Cocody were founded during in this period; built to a large extent in a colonial style, Cocody has since become home to Côte d’Ivoire’s wealthy classes as well as expatriates and foreign diplomats. The district is home to the embassy of France, Hotel Ivoire (which for a long time, was the only African hotel to have a skating rink), and, since 2009, the largest U.S. embassy in West Africa.\n\nConstruction on St. Paul’s Cathedral, designed by Italian architect Aldo Spirito, began with the 1980 groundbreaking by Pope John Paul II and was completed in 1985. From the 1980s, Abidjan’s fortunes declined as a result of negligence on the part of officials as well as corruption and general degradation. In 1983, the village of Yamoussoukro became the new political capital of Ivory Coast under the leadership of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who was born in Yamoussoukro.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2007 and especially from 2010 to 2011, Abidjan suffered from the consequences of the First and Second Ivorian Civil Wars. In November 2004, armed conflict broke out between French forces and Ivorian forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo after the Ivorian Air Force attacked French peacekeepers in northern Côte d’Ivoire. After France destroyed Côte d’Ivoire’s air capabilities in retaliation, pro-Gbagbo groups staged riots and looting in Abidjan and targeted French homes, schools, and businesses. French peacekeepers moved into the city to calm the situation. Other crises during the first civil war period include the case of the Probo Koala in 2006, in which disposed products caused thousands of residents to seek medical attention. Côte d’Ivoire’s civil conflicts seriously impacted the security situation in Abidjan. Amidst the anti-French riots in November 2004, 4,000 prisoners in Abidjan escaped from the country’s largest prison.\n\nAbidjan was one of the main theaters of the 2010-2011 Ivorian crisis and the site of major demonstrations against incumbent president Gbagbo, including one on International Women’s Day in 2011 that saw several demonstrators killed by Gbagbo’s forces. The end of the crisis came with Gbagbo’s capture in Abidjan in April 2011, following a major offensive by forces loyal to election winner Alassane Ouattara with support from France and the UN.\n\nFormerly managed by the French colonial administration, Abidjan became a municipality in 1956, divided into administrative areas by lagoons. Its first municipal council was elected on 18 November 1956, and the first mayor in the context of the Loi-Cadre of 1956 was president Félix Houphouët-Boigny. A 1978 law created twenty-seven municipalities in the country. After the application of this new organization, Dioulo Emmanuel was elected mayor of Abidjan on 30 November 1980.\n\nSince 2001, the city has been divided into ten boroughs (communes). In 2011, the autonomous district of Abidjan was established by a decree instituting a system based on districts and regions instead. with rural sub-prefectures in Anyama, Bingerville, Brofodoumé, and Songon. The autonomous district overlaps the Abidjan Department, which was established in 1969 and has had its current boundaries since 1998. In 2011, the post of Mayor of Abidjan was replaced by that of District Governor, appointed by the head of state. The position has been occupied by Robert Beugré Mambé since 2011. Each of the ten communes of Abidjan has its own municipal council, headed by a mayor. The last municipal elections were held in March 2001. The sub-prefectures of the autonomous district also have their own mayors and councils.\n\nThe communes of Abobo, Adjamé, Attécoubé, Cocody, and Plateau are located north of the Ébrié Lagoon (hence the name \"Abidjan North\"). This is the continental part of Abidjan.\nThe commune of Yopougon straddles the lagoon, with part lying north and part south of that body of water. The communes of Treichville, Koumassi, Marcory, and Port-Bouet in Abidjan are south of the lagoon. Blokosso and Locodjro villages are included within the city and maintain cultural identity in urban areas.\n\nThe University of Abidjan (1958), technical colleges, and the National Library of Côte d'Ivoire and National museum are in Abidjan.\n\nSights in Abidjan include St Paul's Cathedral designed by Aldo Spirito, the Cocody Municipal Museum of Contemporary Art and the Parc du Banco rainforest reserve.\n\nPlateau is known for its skyscrapers, which are unusual in West Africa. It is the business centre of Abidjan. With its gleaming skyscrapers, high-end shops, and outdoor cafes, Plateau is a favourite place of business travelers. There are also many different banks located in the Plateau district.\n\nThe majority of Ivorian government institutions are still located in Abidjan and have not been transferred to the political capital, Yamoussoukro. The President's office is in Cocody, and the parliament, the Constitutional Council, the Supreme Court, and the Chancellery of the National Order are all in Plateau. Under the presidency of Laurent Gbagbo (2000–11), efforts were made to give effect to the project of making the political capital Yamoussoukro in Côte d'Ivoire. This goal continues to be the consensus of the country's political leaders.\n\nGovernment offices are located in Le Plateau in the administrative district of Abidjan, Boulevard Carde or Angoulvant Boulevard (near the Cathedral of St. Paul of Abidjan), or elsewhere in the great buildings of the town.\n\nThe instability of the 2002-2007 civil war and 2010-2011 crisis saw foreign peacekeeping forces stationed in Abidjan. The United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI), established in April 2004, has its headquarters at the former Hotel Sebroko in Attécoubé. While the size of the force has been reduced since the end of the 2011 crisis, UNOCI’s mandate was extended in 2013 and again in 2015. The force remains authorized to maintain up to 5,245 troops, 192 observers, 1,500 police and eight customs officers in the country.\n\nFrance’s peacekeeping operations in Côte d’Ivoire continued under the aegis of Operation Unicorn until 2015 and then as the French forces in Côte d’Ivoire from 2015 onward. In 2014, French defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that Abidjan would be reinforced as the entry point for France’s military presence and counterterrorism operations in the Sahel region. After al-Qaeda militants targeted beachgoers at Grand Bassam in March 2016, the French government announced it would increase its troop deployment in Côte d’Ivoire from 500 to 900. French soldiers are based in Port-Bouet as well as at the Abidjan airport.\n\nIn 2007, Pierre Laba’s comedy film \"Permanent Danger\" explored the laxity of the police against banditry in major African cities, specifically in Abidjan.\n\nAbidjan is divided into districts, each of which has a police station. The municipal police and national police are separate.\n\nAll police are trained at the National Police Academy in the town of Cocody. They are recruited by competitive examination held by the police administration. The police include several sections, such as the BAE (Anti Riot Squad), whose base is located in Yopougon north of the city, the CRS (Republican Security Company), whose main base is located in Williamsville (Adjame) and also includes a secondary base called CRS2, which is located in zone 4 in the town of Marcory in the central capital. The Force and CECOS accompany the police.\n\nThe main base of the gendarmerie is at Agban (commonly Adjamé). There are others in Abobo and Kumasi, It also has a training school in Cocody and the city.\n\nSince 2000, Côte d'Ivoire has experienced a sharp rise in drug trafficking. Drug dens arise mainly in informal settlements and there has been a recent spike in demand among unemployed youth and Ivorian vagrants. The Ivorian police increasingly focus on the fight against trafficking and drug use in the district of Abidjan. A report by the Office of the UN says West Africa plays an increasingly important role in the transit of cocaine to Latin American and Europe. According to an investigation by a United Nations commission for the fight against drug trafficking, 46% of adolescents in West Africa are dependent on illegal drugs. In May 2007, seven drug houses were dismantled and 191 people arrested including a military officer.\n\nAbidjan is home to Port-Bouet, one of the six French military bases that still exist in Africa (Dakar, Libreville, Bouar CAR, N'Djamena and Djibouti). Thousands of people live there, around the 43rd BIMA which is permanently in place in accordance with established defense agreements on 24 April 1961 linking the two countries.\n\nAbidjan is the regional headquarters of major international institutions: UNICEF, UN Development Program, World Health Organization, World Food Program, UNOPS, UNFPA, International Labour Organization (ILO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), etc. International nations all have representation in Abidjan, most of which serve sub-region\n\nThe American Embassy is located in Côte d'Ivoire while the African Development Bank (ADB) moved for a while to Tunisia, which is the largest financial institution in Africa.\n\nAbidjan is sisters with:\n\nIn the 1980s, Jean-Bédel Bokassa took refuge in Abidjan after his ouster from power in the Central Africa Republic.\n\nThe 1998 census recorded Abidjan's population as 2,877,923. Estimates for the population of the Abidjan metropolitan area vary between 4 and 5 million inhabitants. As Abidjan is inhabited by people from a wide array of different ethnicities, French is commonly spoken in the metropolitan area, which is the fourth largest French speaking metropolitan area in the world after Paris, Montreal and Kinshasa. Colloquial Abidjan French has even appeared, which has a different pronunciation and some familiar words from standard French. Abidjan is recognized as one of the few areas in Africa where French (colloquial Abidjan French) is truly a native tongue, along with Libreville, Gabon.\n\nThe population of Abidjan was 4,707,404 at the 2014 census. In 2006, the metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase can be attributed to the displacement since September 2002 caused by the war. Many inhabitants come to live in town for employment and safer housing.\n\nBy 1950, Abidjan had just exceeded a population of 50,000 (at the end of 1948). Reaching a population of a million by the end of 1975, the city grew at a rate of 10 to 12% per year, doubling every six or seven years. However, this growth underwent a sharp decline due to the crises of the 1980s and 1990s. In the last 20 years of the 20th century, the growth rate dropped to 3–6%. Birth rate growth was supplemented by migration, with the influx being substantial and the outflow only partly compensating the arrivals. The migration, prior to the census of 1988, contributed a growth of about 80,000 with 50,000 people from within Côte d'Ivoire, and about 30,000 from abroad per Côte d'Ivoireyear. From within Côte d'Ivoire, the migration pattern was dominated by Akan (South-east, 48%), then Mandé (North-west, 24%) and Krou (South-west, 20%). From abroad, the migration was Burkinabes (30%), Malians (22%), Ghanaians (19%), Nigerien (11%), and Guineans (9%). Of the non-African migration, Lebanese migration was highest, followed by European migration, with the French being largest of this latter group. All in all, people of non-African origin represent 3% of the total population of Abidjan, which remains the highest in the region.\n\nThe figures for 2006 estimated the population of Abidjan to 3,796,677 inhabitants, while the larger metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase is mainly due to war events of September 2002. The town hosts many people in search of both jobs and secure homes.\n\nBefore 2014, the last population census in the country had taken place in 1998. It presented 2,877,948 inhabitants for the city. A new census was held in May 2014 and showed a population for the city of 4,707,404.\n\nThe traditional language of the city was Ebrié. Since independence, the official language in Abidjan and throughout Côte d'Ivoire has been French. While the official language is a formal variety standard French similar to that of Paris, the most commonly spoken form of French in Abidjan is a colloquial dialect known as \"français de Treichville\" or \"français de Moussa\" which differs from standard French in pronunciation and in some of its vocabulary. Another form of spoken French in Abidjan is \"Nouchi\", a highly informal variety used as adolescent slang. The historical lingua franca, still spoken and understood by most of the trading population of Abidjan, is Dioula. The city hosts many Ivorians from all over the country and about sixty vernacular languages are spoken, such as Attié, Baoulé, Bété, and Wobé. Abidjan is surrounded by more than thirty villages where Baoulé and Ébrié are still commonly spoken.\n\nIn Côte d'Ivoire, the enrollment rate is 74% and access to secondary education is limited by an entrance assessment at the 6th stage after which one-third of students are allowed to continue their studies. 24% of the student population resides in Abidjan, which comprises 20% of the total population. Abidjan is the location of the main educational institutions in the Côte d'Ivoire. These include the Lycée Classique d'Abidjan, the Lycée Sainte-Marie de Cocody, Lycée garçon de Bingerville, Mami Adjoua the Lyceum, the Blaise Pascal Abidjan school is a French school – a school who has signed an agreement with the ADFE. Recently the Lycée International Jean-Mermoz re-opened which was initially called College International Jean-Mermoz, founded by Pierre Padovani. The Institution suffered from a devastating war and was forced to close.\n\nSome traditional medicine establishments sell traditional drugs in the street. There are numerous health centers, pharmacies and pharmacopoeias. The city has more than fifty clinics, and over sixty specialist locations (veterinary, dermatology, dental, optometry, motherhood, psychology, pediatrics, etc.).\n\nModern districts like Plateau or Cocody have developed similar to those in Europe with the construction of large office towers and apartment buildings between the 1970s and the mid-1980s.\n\nTraditional neighborhoods like Treichville or Marcory maintained the system of \"concessions\" where housing is adjacent to the plant and an area of several houses, within the normal organization and multi centuries-old African villages.\n\nThe district of Cocody is also home to many single-storey wooden villas, surrounded by vast gardens of lush vegetation, fed by the heavy rains that water the city. Wealthier inhabitants constructed villas in imitation of Greek temples in this district. In addition, many houses were built on stilts on the edge of the Ébrié Lagoon. The town hall, a fine example of modernist architecture, was designed by architect .\n\nThe urban network is disrupted, as Abidjan has seen its population double every seven years since 1945. Rural people are attracted by the opportunities of the city. Abidjan represents 45% of city dwellers in the Côte d'Ivoire and 20% of the overall population. The city is by far the country's largest, dwarfing the second-largest city, Bouaké (which had 542,082 inhabitants in 2014) as well as the political capital, Yamoussoukro (207,412 inhabitants).\n\nSince the 2006 Probo Koala toxic waste spill, significant efforts have been made to address waste management issues in Abidjan. In 2006, a contract was signed between China and Côte d'Ivoire: a Chinese company handling urban waste and industrial plans to treat all waste district this transformation also create daily cleaning. .\n\nFrench nongovernmental organisation ACTED rolled out a three-part project across three districts of Abidjan in 2016, establishing street cleaning, waste collection and hygiene training. ACTED spokesperson Jérémy Lescot described the project as \"a fine success\".\n\nThe last transportation upgrade in Abidjan led to the repaving of certain roads in the capital in 1994. Since May 2007, the company (Road Management Agency) is undertaking major operations in Abidjan and Anyama relating to badly damaged roads, suffering from lack of maintenance, heavy rain and protests. It is also addressing the gutters and unpaved roads. The District and BNETD plan to rehabilitate and construct , providing them with a quality to last 15–20 years of life. Improvements include the rehabilitation of roads in Abidjan and Anyama, construction of drains, the tarring of gravel roads and sanitation of the city by the construction of sewers. These rehabilitations affect all municipalities in Abidjan:\n\n\nThe principal stock exchange of the Cộte d'Ivoire and the other seven countries of the Union Économique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA),Bourse Régionale des Valeurs Mobilières (BRVM), is located in Abidjan. Air Ivoire has its head office in Abidjan. Prior to its dissolution, Air Afrique was headquartered in Abidjan.\n\nThe region near the lagoons is the most industrialized region of the country.\n\nMajor industries include food processing, lumber, automobile manufacturing, textiles, chemicals, and soap. There is also a large oil refinery. Its industries are mainly in construction and maintenance with the presence of major international groups: the furnace SETAO, Colas, Bouygues, Jean Lefebvre, and Swiss Holcim.\n\nThere are textile industries with the packaging of cotton in the north both for export or for on-site processing of cloth, canvas, batik clothing and miscellaneous. The textile sector is very dynamic, and represents 15.6% of net investment, 13% of turnover and 24% of the value added in Ivorian industry.\n\nThere are several offshore oil wells in operation (Côte d'Ivoire is an oil producing country), which leads to the presence of a chemical industry with oil refineries, and an oil port. It also works on stones and precious metals for exportation\n\nThe city also has a large wood processing plant at the port by river from the forests of central Canada. It exports natural mahogany, peeled wood, plywood and chipboard for the past two centuries.\n\nFood industry mainly include: the production of palm oil, bergamot and Seville oranges. In the west, rubber is processed as well as manufacturing beverages from pineapples, oranges and mangoes, producing robust coffee: Côte d'Ivoire is the third largest producer, behind Colombia and Brazil and processing cocoa,it is the third largest producer in the world behind Ghana and Indonesia. (37% of cocoa and 10% of coffee products undergo at least one first local processing). Abidjan is also the first African tuna port for the European market. This generated 3,000 salaried jobs and is an important source of foreign exchange. As in all countries of the Third World developing countries, much of the city's economy lies in what economists describe as informal economy with its many \"odd jobs\".\n\nThe development of tertiary industry, with the establishment of international commercial banks and the increasing number of service companies of all types, appears to be the trend of recent years. Abidjan is the main financial center of French West Africa. The seat of the common stock exchange of West Africa (BRVM) is located in Abidjan. BRVM is mainly dominated by Ivorian firms.\n\nThe thermal power plant Azito, built in 1997 in partnership with EDF, located on the Yopougon on the edge of the lagoon and facing Ébrié Island Boulay, alone provides 300 MW. Two other power plants, built in 1984 and 1985, are installed in Vridi. Several utilities are installed in Abidjan: CI Energies, formerly SOPIE, which is a corporation state, ICE and CIPREL, subsidiaries of the French group SAUR Côte d'Ivoire produces all the electricity it consumes, and exports to neighboring countries, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Mali and Burkina Faso through the interconnection.\n\nThe production, which increases steadily, and gas storage are provided by two state companies: PETROCI and GESTOCI. A small industry of renewable energy production has also developed.\n\nThe city has a powerful fixed telephone network of 450,000 lines (in 2004) managed by \"Côte d'Ivoire Telecom\". Broadband Internet connections, leased lines and ADSL are powered by various providers: Aviso Ivory Coast Telecoms. Africa is Line, Globe Access, Afnet, and as the news portal www.abidjan24.net\n\nAbidjan is home to all the representatives of international financial institutions: World Bank, International Monetary Fund, African Development Bank, BOAD, etc. Banking Commission of WAEMU regional stock exchange securities subsidiaries of major international banks: BNP Paribas, General bank, Crédit Lyonnais, Citibank, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays, etc. Sixteen national banks (SGBCI, BICI, etc.) maintaining a network of 170 branches, seven financial institutions and more than thirty insurance companies make a financial competitive Abidjan that animates the entire West Africa.\n\nTrains on the line to Ouagadougou run from several stations in the city, the most important being in Treichville. Ferries link Treichville, Abobo-Doumé and Le Plateau. Felix Houphouet Boigny International Airport serves the city. Work on a new metro system has begun, with the beginning of service anticipated in 2020.\n\nSOTRA (Abidjan Transport Company) ensure urban transportation in Abidjan via bus, taxi and luggage Line Express.\n\nSotra has announced the start of work for the use of light rail to Abidjan. The project has three phases at a cost of 125 billion CFA francs for a long loop of 32 km.\n\nThere are two kinds: the taxi-meter (Red), which can travel throughout the city, and woro-woro (yellow and green, blue or orange depending on the commune), which are limited to a neighborhood.\n\nPort Bouet Airport has a large capacity that allows it to accommodate all existing large aircraft. Abidjan is located an hour's flight from all the capitals of the sub-region. Abidjan is served by major airlines in the direction of the great capitals of the world. Headquarters of the former multinational African Air company, Abidjan has nearly 900,000 passengers (1995 figure)\n\nThe District has several paved streets and boulevards linking the towns between them and the District across the country. Abidjan has a network of urban bypasses.\n\nRiver transport is already consistent with fishing spots and many \"boat-buses\" connecting the various neighborhoods of the city thrives plan lagoon.\n\nAbidjan is also the bridgehead of the country's only highway linking the city to the administrative and political capital, Yamoussoukro.\n\nAbidjan has one of the biggest ports in the sub-region (West Africa). It is a container transshipment port and was opened in 1951 in the presence of the Minister of Overseas and Colonies at the time, François Mitterrand. The 15m deep Vridi Canal, where boats with large draughts can dock in the deep-water port.\n\nThe Côte d'Ivoire is in the Franc Zone (where the currency is CFA francs), as part of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). Abidjan is the economic centre of both the Côte d'Ivoire and of the whole region, including Burkina Faso and Mali; this is mainly because of its deep-water port. The road network in Abidjan (5,600 km asphalted in 1995, compared to 1,000 km in 1970), which covers the whole region, effectively increases its port activity as 50% of the business from Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger pass through it.\n\nAbidjan receives the bulk of the country's industrial activity; its port alone receiving 60% of ivory park industry. Abidjan has ambitions of oil-production—off-shore production and especially refining and distribution. In 1995 the port received 12 million traffic, of which 5.5 million tonnes were petroleum products.\n\nExports include coffee, cocoa, timber, bananas, pineapples, and manganese.\n\nThe two-halves of the city, Northern Abidjan and Southern Abidjan, are joined by the Houphouët-Boigny, the Charles de Gaulle and the Henri Konan Bédié bridges. The two former bridges, built in the 1950s and 1960s respectively, are located between Treichville and Le Plateau. The Général-de-Gaulle Bridge extends over the immense Valéry Giscard d'Estaing Boulevard which leads to the airport. Both bridges are often congested, especially during rush hour or on the occasion of police and military roadblocks.\n\nA third toll bridge and expressway, the Henri Konan Bédié Bridge between Cocody and Marcory was completed in December 2014. Project construction began in the second half of 2012 and required the relocation of several homes and businesses opposite the Mille Maquis (the noted restaurant \"la Bâche bleue\" was moved). According to data reported by the African Development Bank, 2,499 persons were impacted by the bridge construction and were relocated and compensated.\n\nThe city is the foothold for the region's only railway: the Abidjan-Ouagadougou line, with stations in Treichville, Abobo and Adjamé. This line only has two trains, the \"Gazelle\" and the \"Bélier\", and links the two capitals in about 40 hours.\n\nThe most recent project in Abidjan is one for an electric train which is promised by the Ivory Society of Railroads (SICF).\n\nThe development of infrastructural projects has been envisaged, including a suburban train system in Abidjan which is estimated to cost almost 100 billion CFA francs. This suburban train system would link the North-West to the East and North of the city. The project extends over 25 km of railway tracks which were used by the operator Sitarail, a subsidiary company of the Bolloré group. The infrastructural works (tracks, electrification, and civil engineers) have been estimated at 40 billion CFA francs, financed by the State of Ivory Coast and backers (World Bank and the French Development Agency). In addition, a BOT concession contract would be given to a private operator, over 20–30 years, to operate the network. This operator will be in charge of the acquisition of railway materials, workshop renovation and the implementation of an organisational system. The concession contract has been estimated at around 60 billion CFA francs.\n\nAbidjan is a unique city in Africa. Its nicknames, such as \"Manhattan of the tropics\", \"Small Manhattan\" or \"Pearl of the lagoons\", explain the city's unpredictable and triumphant image. With its accommodation facilities – such as the Golf Hôtel – and sporting facilities, its lively night life, transport and communication lines as well as its impressiveness, it is the perfect city for business tourism.\n\nAbidjan also has beaches around the lagoon, with palm and coconut trees, in the Vridi area, which are very popular at weekends with the picturesque sight of the pineapple and coconut sellers. Nevertheless, the rip-tides which affects practically the whole of the Gulf of Guinea's coast, means that in this area swimming is not usually allowed. Generally, in Cote d'Ivoire, tourism has never really been developed as an economic industry; the country is not much of a common holiday destination.\n\nConverted in 1926, this park has 3,000 hectares and ancient \"sacred wood\" lies at the entrance to the city, in the Attécoubé community, which has been conserved as a relic of the first forest which surrounded the lagoon in the past. A tarmaced road goes straight to the lake at the heart of the park and trails go throughout it. The park is inhabited and there are coffee and cocoa plantations.\n\nAt the edge of the park, a small river serves as a wash-house where the \"fanicos\", laundry men, work after collecting the laundry from the whole of the city. It is one of the 'small jobs' which exist in Abidjan.\n\nOverall, the nightlife in Abidjan is considered to be one of the liveliest in the whole of Africa.\n\nThe district has an abundance of night-clubs, maquis, out-door areas, and go-go bars. These entertainment platforms provide a musical 'pipeline' encompassing mainly DJs, Coupé Décalé and Zouglou, and, in lesser amounts, other local and international varieties.\n\nFormerly containing only local traditional varieties, Congolese music and Western music, Abidjan's night life has experienced a positive cultural disruption in its music since the start of the 2000s, with the arrival of Coupé Décalé.\n\nThis musical genre was introduced in 2002 by and , with the help of Sagacité, created a phenomenon which has not stopped spreading and reaching out to the hot nights in the capitals of the sub-region. It has given a globally identifiable cultural identity to entertainment 'made in Côte d'Ivoire'.\n\nThe very popular Zouglou additionally benefits \"Wôyô\" spaces; furnished and dedicated so that the most famous, the Internat at Fitini's and the Lycee at Vieux Gazeur's, attract 'zouglouphiles' the whole weekend.\n\nTreichville, with its many maquis, discothèques, and jazz clubs, used to be the liveliest area in the city, but since the end of the 1990s Youpougon, Marcory, and Cocody have taken over this role.\n\nThe Treichville mosque, the Cocody mosque, the Plateau Mosque, and Saint-Paul's Cathedral in Abidjan, created by the architect Aldo Spirito and consecrated by Pope John Paul II in 1985, make up the city's main religious buildings. The cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Abidjan. On April 5, 2015, the construction of a new LDS Temple in Abidjan was announced.\n\n\nEach year film festivals are organised in Abidjan: The Clap-Ivoire Festival, the Spanish Film Festival, the Côte d'Ivoire National Film Festial (FESNACI) – the first of which was organised in 2007, the short film festival (FIMA), which has been organised since 1998 by Hanni Tchelley, the Abidjan Israeli Film Festival; the fourth one took place in 2006 in the Goethe Institute.\n\nSeveral films depict or are devoted to the city:\n\nAbidjan is a turntable for West African music, and a major producer of musical art in Africa. The city attracts the majority of musicians from the Côte d'Ivoire mainly because of its many dance clubs, which allow artists to make their debut and express themselves, record companies and national media. Here are a few examples of the most popular artists to have made their debut in Abidjan: Alpha Blondy, Aïcha Koné, the group Magic System, Meiway, and Tiken Jah Fakoly, as well as Gadji Celi, Chantal Taiba, Nayanka Bell, DJ Arafat. In the 1980s Miriam Makeba came to Abidjan when she was not allowed back to her own country, South Africa, as did the Congolese diva Tshala Muana, apostle of the Soukous style of dance.\n\nSince the 1990s, Abidjan has had a significant variety of musical styles being exported throughout Africa and the West. These are Zoblazo, Mapouka, Zouglou and, since 2002, the Coupé-Décalé; the popularity and great variety of these dances make the city a kind of African dance and musical trend capital. Congo-Kinshasa formerly held this title, with rumba, soukous and then ndombolo. Abidjan is also considered the reggae capital of Africa.\n\nEach year, the city organises the following music festivals:\n\n\nMost mass media in Côte d'Ivoire can be found in Abidjan.\n\nThe National Council for Audio-visual Communication (CNCA) is the regulating authority of audio-visual material in Côte d'Ivoire.\n\nRadiodiffusion Television Ivoirienne (RTI) is the radio and television broadcasting authority for Côte d'Ivoire; it is financed by licence fees, publicity and grants. RTI has four television channels and two radio stations: \"La Première\" (non-specialised), \"TV2\", \"RTI Music TV\", \"RTI Sport TV\", \"Radio Côte d'Ivoire\", and \"Fréquence 2\" (non-specialised radio). \"Radio Jam\" is a private radio station in Côte d'Ivoire and is most listened to by young people.\n\nWith regards to private channels, Tam-Tam TV will be the first International Côte d'Ivoire television channel with headquarters in Abidjan, with other studios in the United States, Italy, France, Asia, the Middle East.\n\nThere are also several Côte d'Ivoire TV channels or radio stations available on the Internet: \"Africahit\", \"Music TV\", \"Abidjan.net TV\", \"Bengueshow\", etc.\n\nWith the launch in 2015 of DISCOP Africa Abidjan, the city became a hub for TV market professionals from French-speaking Africa.\n\nAt the time of the single-party, a political situation which ruled over the country for 30 years like most other West African countries after independence, only one daily newspaper was distributed throughout the country: Fraternité Matin, from the parliamentary group PDCI-RDA, which was founded by the first president, Félix Houphouët-Boigny. The advent of multiple parties in Côte d'Ivoiret in 1999 can be seen in the proliferation of newspapers and diverse publications, of which the majority is published in Abidjan.\nThe President, the Prime Minister, the government, and ministers have an official website.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral fashion events are organised in the city each year: \"Les Féeries\" (The Fairies), the ceremonies for Miss Côte d'Ivoire, Miss Abidjan District, Miss Christmas (for 6–11 year olds) and Miss Awoulaba (very prestigious). Moreover, the Yéhé Fashion Show takes place every year, a celebration of African fashion, and the International Festival of Lingerie and Beauty of Abidjan (FILBA).\n\nAbidjan is also the headquarters for Ivory Coast's clothes designers, renowned for being the best in Africa; including Gilles Touré (designer for Miss Côte d'Ivoire) or even Pathéo.\n\n\nCôte d'Ivoire is home to teams from several sports: (basketball, athletics, rugby, handball, volleyball, etc.), soccer is very popular in Abidjan. Abidjan is home to ASEC Mimosas, one of the country's leading football clubs.\n\n\n\nEvents:\n\nIn 1964, the \"Jeux d'Abidjan\" took place in Abidjan, as did the final of the African Cup Winners' Cup in 1975, 1980, 1983, and 1990, then another in 1992 under the name of CAF Confederations Cup. The Stade Félix Houphouët-Boigny was the host of the very first African Super Cup in 1992, and the second in 1998. The finals of the 1966, 1986, 1995, and 1998 CAF Champions League also took place in Abidjan.\n\nThe main football event organised in Abidjan was the 1984 African Cup of Nations and one of the finals of the 1983 African Youth Cup of Nations.\n\nThe economic capital also attracted other football events such as the Assumption Tournament (the first one taking place in 2007 in the Stade Robert Champroux), the West African Club Championship (UFOA Cup), and international gala matches.\n\nBasketball\n\n\nRugby\n\nAbidjan is the centre of Ivorian rugby, and most of the Côte d'Ivoiret national rugby union team come from here. Although the origins of Ivorian rugby go back to the 1960s and earlier, French official Jean-François Turon managed the team at Abidjan University in the 1980s, but it was François Dali who created Ivorian rugby, and his son was the national captain during the 1990s.\n\nCycling\n\n\nTennis\n\n\nJudo\n\n\nAthletics\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n"}

Hadrian knew Syria, having first visited in 117 and again in 123, shortly after his visit to Britannia. A Headstone of a Syrian archer was found along Hadrian's Wall, and dates from the 2nd century Common Era, when 200 Syrian archers were sent to reinforce the 8,000 Roman soldiers. The tombstone is now displayed at the . Field archaeologist Mike Bishop, however, contends that everyone hunted, and the primary value of the Syrian archers was tactical—on the battlefield. Their bows, he explains, were Composite bows (also called “recurved”), capable of longer range than common longbows. “Correct and effective use of the composite bow,” Bishop adds, “took a lifetime to master, so Eastern recruits were essential.”\n\nArab archers used composite bows from foot, horse, and camel, to good effect from the 7th century.\n\nMuhammad was quite good with a bow, and appreciated the benefits of archery in sports and warfare. A recurved bow made of bamboo, and ascribed to Muhammad, is held in the Sacred Relics (Topkapı Palace) in the Chamber of the Sacred Relics in the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul.\n\nThere are several comments by Mohammad concerning archery in the Hadith. Umm Salama told of Muhammed coming upon two groups practicing archery, and he praised them.\n\nMalik ibn Anas spoke about when at the battle of Uhud, the troops left Muhammad behind, where the archer, Abu Talhah, remained behind and protected the Prophet with his shield.\n\nUqbah ibn Amir relates how Muhammad said that archery shooting was more dear to him than riding.\n\nThe Prophet owned six bows: az-Zawra’, ar-Rauha’, as-Safra’, al-Bayda’, al-Katum – which was broke during the battle of Battle of Uhud, and was taken by Qatadah bin an-Nu’man – and as-Saddad. The Prophet had a quiver called al-Kafur, and a strap for it made from tanned skin, as well as three silver circular rings, a buckle, and an edge made of silver. We should mention that Ibn Taymiyyah said that there are no authentic narrations that the Prophet ever wore a strap around his waist.\n\nThere are a number of Arab Archery clubs and societies today. Some practice the traditional Arab archery, while others use Western styles of archery in sport competition and hunting.\nThe main organization is FATA, or the \"Fédération Arabe de Tir a L'Arc\" of Lebanon, a member of the World Archery Federation. \nThe Pan Arab Games usually have an archery competition, and the 12th Arab Games in Qatar held in 2011 had 60 archers from nine Arab countries compete.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53930969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53930969", "title": "Brut Chronicle", "text": "Brut Chronicle\n\nThe Brut\" Chronicle, also known as the Prose \"Brut, is the collective name of a number of medieval chronicles of the history of England. The original Prose \"Brut\" was written in Anglo-Norman; it was subsequently translated into Latin and English. The chronicle begins England's history with the mythological founding of Britain by Brutus of Troy, named \"Brut\" in French and English; Brutus is the legendary great-grandson of Aeneas and his founding of Britain thus links that country to the grand history of Troy.\n\nThe first Anglo-Norman versions end with the death of King Henry III in 1272; subsequent versions extend the narrative. Fifty versions in Anglo-Norman remain, in forty-nine manuscripts, in a variety of versions and stages. Latin translations of the Anglo-Norman versions remain in nineteen different versions, which fall into two main categories; some of those were subsequently translated into Middle English. There are no fewer than 184 versions of the English translation of the work in 181 medieval and post-medieval manuscripts, the highest number of manuscripts for any text in Middle English except for Wycliffe's Bible. The sheer number of copies that survive and its late-fourteenth century translation into the vernacular indicating the growth in common literacy; it is considered \"central\" to the literary culture of late-medieval England.\n\nOriginally a legendary chronicle written in Anglo-Norman in the thirteenth century (identified by the fact that some existing copies finish in 1272), the \"Brut\" described the settling of England by Brutus of Troy, son of Aeneas, and the reign of the Welsh Cadwalader. In this, it was itself based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's text from the previous century. It also covered the reigns of many kings later the subject of legend, including King Cole, King Leir (the subject of Shakespeare's play, King Lear), and King Arthur, and exists in both abridged and long versions. Early versions describe the country as being divided, both culturally and politically, by the River Humber, with the southern half described as \"this side of the Humber\" and \"the better part\". Having been written at a time of division between crown and nobility, it was \"baronial in its sympathies\". It was probably originally composed \"at least in part\" by clerks in the Royal chancery, although not as an official history. It later became a source for monastic chronicles. Popular already in its early incarnations, it may even have limited the circulation of rival contemporary histories.\n\nThe \"Brut\" underwent various revisions over the centuries, and from 1333 material inflected from a mid-thirteenth century poem, \"Des Grantz Geanz\", describing the settlement of England (as Albion), had entered the main versions. Eventually, along with the \"Polychronicon\", it was one of the most popular political and secular histories of fourteenth-century England, with the latest-known version ending with events from 1479.\n\nEnglish editions appeared from the early 1400s, particularly the so-called Long version and its various continuations. This has become known as the \"Common\" version, and was probably transcribed in Herefordshire. A later fifteenth-century version consists of the Common versions with \"a major one\" concluding in 1419, occasionally with the addition of prologues and epilogues. The 1500s also saw an abridged version, created from the major fifteenth-century copies.\n\nIt was primarily of interest to the upper-gentry and the English nobility, but, the more it got added to and altered, so it became noticed by other sectors of society. Firstly the clergy, for whom it was translated into Latin, and then into the more accessible French and then English for the lower gentry and mercantile classes. It was thus available to much of English society; certainly, as Andrea Ruddock has said, to the entire political class. And, since it only took \"one literate person to make a text available to an entire household\", its circulation could have been even broader. Similarly, there are vast differences in the quality of the surviving manuscripts, and Julia Marvin has suggested that this reflects their \"diverse ownership and readership\". It has been described as \"a tremendous success\", and one of the most-copied chronicles of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. A version produced in York in the later fourteenth century was based on official contemporary records, and contains, for example, an eye-witness account of the Good Parliament of 1376. The post-1399 versions are notable by their clear pro-Lancastrian bias and focus on King Henry V's victories in France, for example at Rouen, for the purposes of propaganda. However, even these later versions still contained much of the earlier legendary material, such as that of Albina; indeed, the prose versions have been described as being \"enthusiastic\" in its rendition of these aspects of English history. It has also been described as \"one of the best records of rumours and propaganda, if not of the event themselves.\"\n\nThere are fifty versions in Anglo-Norman, in forty-nine manuscripts, in various versions and stages. There are Latin translations of the Anglo-Norman versions in nineteen different versions, which fall into two main categories; some of those were subsequently translated into Middle English. There are no fewer than 184 versions of the English translation of the work in 181 medieval and post-medieval manuscripts, the highest number of manuscripts for any text in Middle English except for Wycliffe's Bible. From the fifteenth century there is \"an amorphous, heterogenous group\" of texts which are composed of individual's notes and preliminary workings of various areas of the \"Brut\". The English edition made it the first chronicle to be written in the vernacular since the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.\n\nAfter the \"massive scribal activity\" that produced over 250 extant manuscripts (a \"vast number for a medieval text\"), the \"Brut\" was the first chronicle printed in England. The \"Brut\" was one of William Caxton's first printings, and he may have compiled this version himself. Between 1480, when Caxton printed it as the \"Chronicles of England\", and 1528 it went through thirteen editions. As a result, according to Matheson, \"it is no exaggeration to say that in the late Middle Ages in England the \"Brut\" was the standard historical account of British and English history\".\n\nTudor historians such as John Stow, Raphael Holinshed, and Edward Hall relied extensively on the \"Brut\", and so, by extension, did William Shakespeare.\n\nThe Anglo-Norman text was initially intended for a lay audience of the upper class. Likely and certain owners of versions of the \"Brut\" included Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick, Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, Isabella of France (who gave a copy to her son, Edward III of England), and Thomas Ughtred, 1st Baron Ughtred (in his will he left it to his wife). Copies were also listed in the library catalogs of religious houses--Fountains Abbey, Hailes Abbey, Clerkenwell Priory, and St Mary's Abbey, York (which had two copies). Matheson lists five manuscripts of continental providence, produced in France, Flanders, and Lorraine.\n\nOutside the traditional lay, upper-class audience, the reach of the Middle English translations of the \"Brut\" extended the audience to the merchant class. Landowning gentry with a Middle English copy of the \"Brut\" include John Sulyard's father, who passed it on to Henry Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Essex's son Thomas. John Warkworth of Peterhouse, Cambridge, owned a copy (which included the Warkworths \"Chronicle\", named for him), as did the religious houses St Bartholomew-the-Great and Dartford Priory, among others. Matheson identifies a number of women owners and readers as well: Isabel Alen (niece of vicar William Trouthe), Alice Brice, Elizabeth Dawbne, and Dorothy Helbartun.\n\nThe Brut's significance is now seen as being in the fact that it was written by laymen, for laymen, and also that the latter portion, at least, was one of the first chronicles written in the English language; it also occasionally provides historical details not found in other contemporaries' writings. The Brut owned by the Mortimer family in the late fourteenth-century contained their view of their own genealogy (which they also traced back to King Arthur and Brutus).\n\nThe first scholarly edition of the later-medieval portion was transcribed and edited by J.S. Davies for the Camden Society in 1856, and in 1879 James Gairdner published parts of it relating to the Hundred Years' War in his \"Historical Recollections of a London Citizen\". In 1905, C.S.L. Kingsford published three versions in his \"Chronicles of London\", and the following year F.W.D. Brie published a list of all extant manuscripts in his \"The Brute of England or The Chronicles of England.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "3377680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3377680", "title": "Cave of Treasures", "text": "Cave of Treasures\n\nThe Cave of Treasures, sometimes referred to simply as The Treasure, is a book of the New Testament apocrypha. It was written in the sixth century or later.\n\nThis text is attributed to Ephrem Syrus, who was born at Nisibis soon after AD 306 and died in 373, but it is now generally believed that its current form is 6th century or newer.\n\nThe assertion that the \"Cave of Treasures\" was written in the 4th century is supported by the general contents of the work. These reproduce Ephrem's peculiar methods of exegesis and supply many examples of his methods in religious argument, with which we are familiar from his other writings. His pride in the antiquity of the Syriac language also appears in this work. That it was written in Mesopotamia by a Syrian, there is no doubt, and if Ephrem was not the original author, or perhaps later editor, belonged to the school of Ephrem.\n\nThe oldest Christian work on the history of God's dealing with man from Adam to Christ is probably the anonymous \"Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan\", which, in its original form, is from the 5th or 6th century AD. The writer of the \"Cave of Treasures\" borrowed largely from the \"Conflict of Adam and Eve\", or shared a common source with it.\n\nThe \"Cave of Treasures\" was introduced to the world by Giuseppe Simone Assemani, the author of the Catalogues of Oriental Manuscripts in the Vatican Library, which he printed in \"Bibliotheca Orientalis\" in four thick volumes folio. In Vol. ii. page 498 he describes a Syriac manuscript containing a series of apocryphal works, and among them is one the title of which he translates \"Spelunca Thesaurorum.\" He saw that the manuscript contained the history of 5,500 years, from the creation of Adam to the birth of Christ, and that it was based upon the Scriptures. He says that fables are found in it everywhere, especially concerning the antediluvian Patriarchs, and the genealogy of Christ and His Mother. He mentions that the Patriarch Eutychius also describes a cave of treasures in which gold, frankincense, and myrrh were laid up, and refers to the \"portentosa feminarum nomina,\" women of Jesus' ancestry. No attempt was made to publish the Syriac text; in fact, little attention was paid to it until August Dillmann began to study the \"Conflict of Adam and Eve\" in connection with it, and then he showed in Ewald's \"Jahrbüchern\" (Bd. V. 1853) that the contents of whole sections of the \"Book of the Cave of Treasures\" in Syriac and the \"Conflict of Adam and Eve\" in Ethiopic were identical. And soon after this, Dillmann and others noticed that an Arabic manuscript in the Vatican (No. XXXIX; see Assemânî, Bibl. Orient. i. page 281) contained a version of the \"Cave of Treasures\", which had clearly been made from the Syriac. In 1883 Carl Bezold published a translation of the Syriac text of the \"Cave of Treasures\" made from three manuscripts (Die Schatzhöhle, Leipzig, 1883), and five years later published the Syriac text of it, accompanied by the text of the Arabic version.\nSome passages from the \"Cave of Treasures\" are also found in the Coptic \"Enconium of Mary Magdalene\" of Pseudo-Cyril.\n\nOf the subsequent history of the Syriac \"Cave of Treasures\", little is known. The knowledge of parts of it made its way into Armenia soon after the book was written, and more than one translation of it was made into Arabic, probably in the 7th and 8th centuries. In connection with the Arabic translations, they all end with the account of the cruelties perpetrated by Archelaus and Sâlûm after the death of Herod. (See Bezold's text, page 247.) The last paragraph of the Arabic text mentions the twelve Apostles who went about with Christ, and refers to His baptism by John the Baptist, and says that He lived on the earth thirty-three years, and then ascended into heaven. Thus for the last twenty-six pages of the Syriac text there is no equivalent in the Arabic version. The same is substantially true for the Ethiopic \"Conflict of Adam and Eve\". The section of the Syriac for which there is no rendering in Arabic or Ethiopic contains a series of statements addressed to the author's \"brother Nemesius.\" It is possible but unlikely that these were added to the work by a later writer. As they do not deal with matters of genealogy, and deal almost exclusively with Jesus Christ's life and crucifixion, they probably failed to interest the Arab translator, and he left them untranslated, unless parts of the original Arabic translation have perished.\n\nThat the Syriac \"Cave of Treasures\" was known and used by Solomon, Bishop of Perâth Maishân (Al-Basrah) in 1222 is proved by the earlier chapters of his work the \"Book of the Bee\". He excerpted from it many of the legends of the early Patriarchs, although his object was not to write a table of genealogical succession, but a full history of the Christian Dispensation according to the views of the Nestorians. The best manuscript of the \"Cave of Treasures\" which we have to the Nestorians, for Brit. Mus. MS. Add. 25875, was written by a Nestorian scribe in the Nestorian village of Alkôsh, and was bound up by him in a volume which included a copy of the \"Book of the Bee\", whose author, Solomon, was the Nestorian Bishop of Al-Basrah early in the 13th century.\n\nThe author of the \"Cave of Treasures\" called his work \"The Book of the order of the succession of Generations (or Families),\" the Families being those of the Patriarchs and Kings of Israel and Judah; and his chief object was to show how Christ was descended from Adam. He did not accept the genealogical tables which were commonly in use among his unlearned fellow-Christians, because he was convinced that all the ancient tables of genealogies which the Jews had possessed were destroyed by fire by the captain of Nebuchadnezzar's army immediately after the capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. The Jews promptly constructed new tables of genealogies, which both Christians and Arabs regarded as fictitious. The Arabs were as deeply interested in the matter as the Christians, for they were descended from Abraham, and the genealogy of the descendants of Hagar and Ishmael was of the greatest importance in their sight, and it is due to their earnest desire to possess correct genealogical tables of their ancestors that we owe the Arabic translations of the \"Cave of Treasures\". The Nubians and Egyptians were also interested in such matters, for the former were the legendary descendants of Kûsh, and the latter the descendants of Mizraim, and Ham was the great ancestor of both these nations. It is clear that medieval Syrians, Arabs, Egyptians and Ethiopians regarded the \"Cave of Treasures\" as an authoritative work on their respective pedigrees.\n\nIn the title \"Cave of Treasures\" which was given to the \"Book of the order of the succession of Generations\" there is probably a double allusion, namely, to the Book as the storehouse of literary treasures, and to the legendarily famous cave in which Adam and Eve were made to dwell by God after their expulsion from Paradise, which was said to contain gold, and frankincense, and myrrh and was thus commonly called \"The Cave of Treasures\" (in Syriac, \"Me`ârath Gazzê\", in Arabic, \"Ma`ârah al-Kanûz\", and in Ethiopic, \"Ba`âta Mazâgebet\").\n\nThe Syriac \"Cave of Treasures\" tells us very little about the supposed physical attritubes of the cave, said to be situated in the side of a mountain below Paradise, and nothing about Adam and Eve's way of life there. But in the \"Book of Adam and Eve\", the whole of the first main section is devoted to details of the physical cave.\n\n"}

He is particularly known for his contribution to the history of the Archdiocese of Trier.\n\nBrouwer was born in Arnhem, The Netherlands. In 1580 he entered the Society of Jesus, and after a thorough humanistic training, devoted himself especially to the study of church history. His attainments in other branches of learning are shown by his appointment as professor of philosophy at Trier; later he was appointed rector, first at Fulda, and then at Trier. His chief work was entitled: \"Antiquitates et annales Trevirenses et episcoporum Treverensis ecclesiae suffragorum\". The work extends to the year 1600 and was prepared at the request of two archbishops, Johann VII of Schoenenberg and Lothar of Mitternich, with the intent to disprove the partisan publication of Hermann (Kyriander), Syndic of Trier. Hermann's work was published in 1576 and was written to support the claims of the city against the rights of the archbishop.\n\nBrouwer devoted the greater part of his life to the preparation of his book and, according to the testimony of the historian Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim, he is deserving of undying honor for his contribution to the history of the Archbishopric of Trier. Unfortunately, he did not live to complete his task. Brouwer's unflinching love of truth and his true historical method were not agreeable to the councilors of the archbishop; so, although the publication of his work had been sanctioned by the authorities of his order, it could not be issued. It was not until 1626 that the work of printing his manuscript at Cologne could be undertaken, and then only after important alterations had been made in the text. New difficulties arose when the eighteenth book was in press. The completion of the printing was forbidden and all the sheets already struck off were suppressed as much as possible, so that only a few copies have come down to us. Brouwer's labors were continued from 1600 to 1652 by Jacob Masenius, who issued the whole work in revised form in 1670 in two folio volumes at Liege.\n\nBrouwer was unable to complete his other great work, which was entitled \"Metropolis Ecclesiae Trevericae\". It was intended to contain a description of all the cities, churches, and monasteries in the Archdiocese of Trier. This work did not appear until 1855-56, when it was issued at Koblenz in two volumes by Christian vom Stramberg. The edition does not meet fully the demands of our time; nevertheless it contains much that is useful. Brouwer's history of the Diocese of Fulda is also worthy of mention. It is entitled: \"Fuldensium antiquitatum libri 4\" (Antwerp, 1612). Of less importance is the work issued at Mainz in 1616, entitled \"Sidera illustrium et sanctorum virorum, qui Germaniam ornarunt\". Among the results of his humanistic studies is the edition of the works of Bishop Venantius Fortunatus, which was issued at Mainz in 1603, together with a life of Saint Martin of Tours. A second edition appeared in 1617 augmented by the annotated poems of Archbishop Rabanus Maurus.\n\nHe died in Trier, Germany.\n"}
{"id": "187919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187919", "title": "Cultural impact of the Beatles", "text": "Cultural impact of the Beatles\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.\n\nTheir continued commercial and critical success assisted many cultural movements—including a shift from American artists' global dominance of rock and roll to British acts (British Invasion), the proliferation of young musicians in the 1960s who formed new bands, the album as the dominant form of record consumption over singles, the term \"Beatlesque\" used to describe similar-sounding artists, and several fashion trends. At the height of their popularity, Lennon controversially remarked that the group had become \"more popular than Jesus\". The Beatles were still challenged for record sales and artistic prestige, mainly by the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones. Many of the Beatles' music experiments were also not without precedent. However, no other acts provoked as many changes in the pop mainstream than the Beatles or Dylan, having opened new spaces for creative advancement and exploiting them to an exceeding degree. The Beatles' innovations notably contributed to the new psychedelic and progressive music, and some of the band's unusual production techniques later became part of normal recording practice.\n\nAs of 2009, the Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with estimated claimed sales of over 600 million records worldwide. They have had more number-one albums on the British charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act. They ranked number one on \"Billboard\" magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary. , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, with twenty. They've also had myriad cover versions from a variety of artists, while \"Yesterday\" is one of the most covered songs in the history of recorded music. In 1999, the Beatles were collectively included in \"Time\" magazine's compilation of . In 2017, a study of AllMusic's catalog indicated the Beatles as the most frequently cited artist influence in its database.\n\nRegarding the ever-changing landscapes of popular music, musicologist Allan Moore notes; \"Sometimes, audiences gravitate towards a centre. The most prominent period when this happened was in the early to mid 1960s when it seems that almost everyone, irrespective of age, class or cultural background, listened to the Beatles.\" On 9 February 1964, the Beatles gave their first live US television performance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", watched by approximately 73 million viewers in over 23 million households, or 34 per cent of the American population. Biographer Jonathan Gould writes that, according to the Nielsen rating service, it was \"the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television \".\n\nThe Beatles subsequently sparked the British Invasion of the US and became a globally influential phenomenon. During the previous four decades, the United States had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood movies, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. On 4 April 1964, the Beatles occupied the top five US chart positions, as well as 11 other positions in the Top 100. As of 2013, they remain the only act to have done so, having also broken 11 other chart records in the \"Billboard\" Top 100 and \"Billboard\" 200. Author Luis Sanchez wrote: \"to grasp the mania that persists in our collective imagination is to follow the proselytizing drift of a question like 'Who is your favorite Beatle?'\" By August 1965, they \"had transformed into an abstraction of their own success, a phenomenon to be devoured rather than heard. The pressure of that phenomenon led to one of the most mythologized of pop career reversals. ... quietly resigning from the drudge of touring to get serious about their art.\"\n\nThe Beatles maintained their most significant competition with Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys. Dylan and the Stones were symbolic of the nascent youth revolt against institutional authority, something that was not immediately recognisable within the Beatles until after 1966. The Beatles' initial clean-cut personas contrasted with the Rolling Stones' \"bad boy\" image, and so the music press forged a rivalry between the two, but as author Barry Miles says, \"[it was] to give themselves something to write about, [and] there was actually no contest between the two groups in anything other than chart positions.\" The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame states that, with regard to 1960s rock bands, the Beach Boys \"place second only to the Beatles in terms of their overall impact on the [US] top 40\" and were the Beatles' \"most serious competitors on a creative level, too\". Following the widespread changes brought about by the Beatles' arrival in the United States, author Mitchell K. Hall writes, \"for a time the Beach Boys provided the Beatles with their most consistent American artistic and commercial competition.\" Another group, the Byrds, were widely celebrated as the American answer to the Beatles, and while their long-term influence has proven to be comparable to the Beatles and the Beach Boys, the Byrds' record sales failed to match those groups.\n\nDylan is described by Ian MacDonald as \"the only figure to have matched The Beatles' influence on popular culture since 1945\" and by Charles Kaiser as \"their most important rival. ... For the next six years [after 1964], the contest between Dylan and the Beatles would be one of the most productive of all modern musical rivalries. The Beatles made it clear that they regarded Bob Dylan as the musical force to be reckoned with, and Dylan reciprocated these feelings.\" In August 1964, the Beatles met Dylan in person, and he proceeded to introduce them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\": Dylan's audience of \"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\" contrasted with their fans, \"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. They were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\" Within a year, \"the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated [and the group's] audience ... [was] showing signs of growing up.\" In this period, no other acts provoked as many changes in the pop mainstream than the Beatles or Dylan, having opened new spaces for creative advancement and exploiting them to an exceeding degree.\n\nAccording to Simon Philo, the Dylan–Beatles rivalry was \"put on hold\" after Dylan was left to convalesce from his July 1966 motorcycle accident. Consequently, the Beatles \"publicly anointed a new favorite and rival in chief, the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson\". Previously in July 1964, the Beach Boys had achieved their first number one single with \"I Get Around\", which represented the start of an unofficial rivalry between the Beatles and Wilson, principally for McCartney. The Beatles and the Beach Boys inspired each other with their artistry and recording techniques, pushing them further out in the studio. According to Sanchez, in 1965, \"Dylan was rewriting the rules for pop success\" with his music and image, and it was at this juncture that Wilson \"led The Beach Boys into a transitional phase in an effort to win the pop terrain that had been thrown up for grabs.\" Wilson then produced the 1966 works \"Pet Sounds\" and \"Good Vibrations\". For the annual best-band poll conducted by \"NME\" between 1963 and 1969, 1966 was the only year that the Beatles did not win, losing to the Beach Boys. According to author Carys Wyn Jones, the interplay between these two groups during the \"Pet Sounds\" era remains one of the most noteworthy episodes in rock history. In 2003, when \"Rolling Stone\" magazine created its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", the publication placed \"Pet Sounds\" second to honour its influence on the highest ranked album, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967).\n\nWriting for AllMusic, music critic Richie Unterberger recognises the Beatles as both \"the greatest and most influential act of the rock era\" and a group that \"introduced more innovations into popular music than any other rock band of the 20th century\". In \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's \"Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll\" (2001), the editors define the band's influence as follows:\n\nThe Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership, along with the partnership between Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, as well as other British Invasion songwriters, inspired changes to the music industry because they were bands that wrote and performed their own music. This trend threatened the professional songwriters that dominated the American music industry. Ellie Greenwich, a Brill Building songwriter, said, “When the Beatles and the entire British Invasion came in, we were all ready to say, ‘Look, it’s been nice, there’s no more room for us… It’s now the self-contained group- males, certain type of material. What do we do?\" \"Rolling Stone\" editors elaborated: \"One of the first rock groups to write most of its own material, they inaugurated the era of self-contained bands and forever centralized pop ... Their music, from the not-so-simple love songs they started with to their later perfectionist studio extravaganzas, set new standards for both commercial and artistic success in pop.\"\n\nIn response to the Beatles' 1964 breakthrough, music writers started including pop and rock music in serious discussion. The dominance of the single as the primary medium of music sales changed with the release of several iconic concept albums in the 1960s, such as \"Sgt. Pepper's\", \"Pet Sounds\", \"A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector\" (1963), and the Mothers of Invention's \"Freak Out!\" (1966). In January 1966, \"Billboard\" magazine cited the initial US sales of the Beatles' 1965 album \"Rubber Soul\" (1.2 million copies over nine days) as evidence of teenage record-buyers increasingly moving towards the LP format. According to author David N. Howard, the standard of the all-original compositions on \"Rubber Soul\" was also responsible for a shift in focus from singles to creating albums without the usual filler tracks. \"Rolling Stone\" Andy Greene credits \"Sgt. Pepper's\" with marking the beginning of the Album era. The musicologist Oliver Julien credits \"Sgt. Pepper\" with contributing towards the evolution of long-playing albums from a \"distribution format\" to a \"creation format\". In musicologist Allen Moore's view, the album assisted \"the cultural legitimization of popular music\" while providing an important musical representation of its generation. It is regarded by journalists as having influenced the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.\n\nThe Beatles reinvented and expanded the terms of commercial and artistic achievement, treading new ground for their willingness to experiment and take risks. One criticism of the group's work is that none of it was truly unprecedented. Author Bill Martin objects to this notion: \"There has always been experimentation in rock music ... Rock music is synthesis and transmutation ... [but] what was original about the Beatles is that they synthesized and transmuted more or less \"everything\", they did this in a way that reflected their time, they reflected their time in a way that spoke to a great part of humanity, and they did all of this really, really well.\" Unterberger adds: \"they were among the few artists of any discipline that were simultaneously the best at what they did and the most popular at what they did. Relentlessly imaginative and experimental, the Beatles grabbed hold of the international mass consciousness in 1964 and never let go for the next six years, always staying ahead of the pack in terms of creativity but never losing their ability to communicate their increasingly sophisticated ideas to a mass audience. Their supremacy as rock icons remains unchallenged to this day, decades after their breakup in 1970.\"\n\nThe Beatles' impact on the US was particularly strong, where a garage rock phenomenon had already begun, with hits such as \"Louie Louie\" by the Kingsmen. The movement received a major lift following the group's historic appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" watched by a record-breaking viewing audience of a nation mourning the recent death of President John F. Kennedy. Bill Dean writes: \"It's impossible to say just how many of America's young people began playing guitars and forming bands in the wake of The Beatles' appearance on the Sullivan show. But the anecdotal evidence suggests thousands – if not hundreds of thousands or even more – young musicians across the country formed bands and proceeded to play.\"\n\nTom Petty, who played in two garage bands in Gainesville, Florida during the 1960s, is quoted mentioning the Beatles' appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and how it influenced him to be in a band. According to him: \"Within weeks of that, you could drive through literally any neighborhood in Gainesville and you would hear the strains of garage bands playing ... I mean everywhere. And I'd say by a year from that time, Gainesville probably had 50 bands.\" For many, particularly young baby boomers, the Beatles' visit reignited the sense of excitement and possibility that had been momentarily taken by Kennedy's assassination. Much of this new excitement would be expressed in music, sometimes much to the chagrin of parents and elders, as kids raced to start bands by thousands, and this proliferation of new groups was not limited to the United States.\n\nWhile the Beatles are often credited for sparking a musical revolution, research conducted by the Queen Mary University of London and Imperial College London suggests that the changes sparked by the band were already developing long before they entered the US. The study, which looks at shifts in chord progressions, beats, lyrics and vocals, shows that American music in the beginning of the 1960s was already moving away from mellow sounds like doo-wop and into more energetic rock styles. Professor Armand Lero argues that the Beatles' innovations have been overstated by music historians: \"They didn’t make a revolution or spark a revolution, they joined one. The trend is already emerging and they rode that wave, which accounts for their incredible success.\" Beatles biographer Mark Lewisohn disagreed with the research by Queen Mary University, saying it \"[doesn't] stack up ... Speak to anyone who was a young person in the US when The Beatles arrived and they will tell you how much of a revolution it was. They were there and they will tell you that the Beatles revolutionised everything.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison was one of the first people to own a Rickenbacker 360/12, a guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart; the higher four are pairs tuned in unison. The Rickenbacker is unique among twelve-string guitars in having the lower octave string of each of the first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string. This, and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve-string guitar provided the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles' recordings.\n\nHis use of this guitar during the recording of \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964) helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that \"Melody Maker\" termed it the Beatles' \"secret weapon\". Roger McGuinn liked the effect so much that it became his signature guitar sound with the Byrds. While the Everly Brothers and the Searchers laid the foundations for jangle pop in the late 1950s to mid 1960s, the Beatles and the Byrds are commonly credited with launching the popularity of the \"jangly\" sound that defined the genre. In addition to the Byrds and Dylan, the Beatles were a huge influence on the folk rock explosion that would follow in the next year.\n\nWith the rise of the Beatles in 1963, the terms Mersey sound and Merseybeat were applied to bands and singers from Liverpool, and this was the first time in British pop music that a sound and a location were linked together. The origins of power pop date back to the early to mid 1960s with what AllMusic calls: \"a cross between the crunching hard rock of the Who and the sweet melodicism of the Beatles and the Beach Boys, with the ringing guitars of the Byrds thrown in for good measure\".\n\nProgressive rock (or art rock) grew out of the classically-minded strains of British psychedelia. In 1966, the level of social and artistic correspondence among British and American rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Byrds who fused elements of cultivated music with the vernacular traditions of rock. According to Everett, the Beatles' \"experimental timbres, rhythms, tonal structures, and poetic texts\" on their albums \"Rubber Soul\" and \"Revolver\" \"encouraged a legion of young bands that were to create progressive rock in the early 1970s\". Academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell identify the Beatles \"not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days\". After the release of \"Rubber Soul\", many \"baroque-rock\" works would soon appear, particularly due to its track \"In My Life\".\n\nCiting a quantitative study of tempos in music from the era, musicologist Walter Everett identifies \"Rubber Soul\" as a work that was \"made more to be thought about than danced to\", and an album that \"began a far-reaching trend\" in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music. Although the Kinks, the Yardbirds and the Beatles themselves (with \"Ticket To Ride\") had incorporated droning guitars to mimic the qualities of the sitar, \"Rubber Soul\"s \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" is generally credited as sparking a musical craze for the sound of the instrument in the mid-1960s — a trend which would later be associated with the growth of raga rock, Indian rock, and the essence of psychedelic rock. In terms of bridging the relationship between music and hallucinogens, the Beatles and the Beach Boys were the most pivotal. \"Revolver\" ensured that psychedelic pop emerged from its underground roots and into the mainstream.\n\nAuthor Carys Wyn Jones locates \"Sgt. Pepper's\", along with \"Pet Sounds\", to the beginning of art rock. Both albums are largely viewed as beginnings in the progressive rock genre due to their lyrical unity, extended structure, complexity, eclecticism, experimentalism and influences derived from classical music forms. For several years following \"Sgt. Pepper\" release, straightforward rock and roll was supplanted by a growing interest in extended form. Several of the English psychedelic bands who followed in the wake of the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's\" developed characteristics of the Beatles' music (specifically their classical influence) further than either the Beatles or contemporaneous West Coast psychedelic bands. AllMusic states that the first wave of art rock musicians were inspired by \"Sgt. Pepper's\" and believed that for rock music to grow artistically, they should incorporate elements of European and classical music to the genre.\n\nThe Beatles were the first entertainment act to stage a large stadium concert. At Shea Stadium in\nNew York City on Sunday, 15 August 1965, the group opened their 1965 North American tour to a record audience of 55,600. The event sold out in 17 minutes. It was the first concert to be held at a major outdoor stadium and set records for attendance and revenue generation, demonstrating that outdoor concerts on a large scale could be successful and profitable. The Beatles returned to Shea for a highly successful encore in August 1966.\n\nThe Beatle haircut, also known as the \"mop-top\" (or moptop), because of its resemblance to a mop, or \"Arthur\" among fans, is a mid-length hairstyle named after and popularised by the Beatles, and widely mocked by many adults. It is a straight cut – collar-length at the back and over the ears at the sides, with a straight fringe (bangs). Because of the immense popularity of the Beatles, the haircut was widely imitated worldwide between 1964 and 1966. Their hair-style led toy manufacturers to begin producing real-hair and plastic \"Beatle Wigs\". Lowell Toy Manufacturing Corp. of New York was licensed to make \"the only AUTHENTIC Beatle Wig\". There have been many attempts at counterfeiting, but in its original packaging this wig has become highly collectible.\n\nMikhail Safonov wrote in 2003 that in the Brezhnev-dominated Soviet Union, mimicking the Beatles' hairstyle was seen as highly rebellious. Young people were called \"hairies\" by their elders, and were arrested and forced to have their hair cut in police stations.\n\nBeatle boots are tight-fitting, Cuban-heeled, ankle-length boots with a pointed toe. They originated in 1963 when Brian Epstein discovered Chelsea boots while browsing in the London footwear company Anello & Davide. He consequently commissioned four pairs (with the addition of Cuban heels) for the Beatles to complement their new suit image upon their return from Hamburg, who wore them under drainpipe trousers.\n\nIn May 1966, John Lennon said of people covering their songs, \"Lack of feeling in an emotional sense is responsible for the way some singers do our songs. They don't understand and are too old to grasp the feeling. Beatles are really the only people who can play Beatle music.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7563271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7563271", "title": "Cut (archaeology)", "text": "Cut (archaeology)\n\nIn archaeology and archaeological stratification a cut or truncation is a context that represents a moment in time when other archaeological deposits were removed for the creation of some feature such as a ditch or pit. In layman's terms, a cut can be thought of a hole that was dug in the past, though cut also applies to other parts of the archaeological record such as horizontal truncations like terraced ground. A cut context is sometimes referred to as a \"negative context\" as opposed to a \"positive context\". The term denotes that a cut has removed material from the archaeological record or natural at the time of its creation as opposed to a positive context which adds material to the archaeological record. A cut has zero thickness and no material properties of its own and is defined by the limits of other contexts. Cuts are seen in the record by virtue of the difference between the material it was cut through and the material that back fills it. This difference is seen as an \"edge\" by the archaeologists on site. This is shown in the picture above (Fig 1.), where a half sectioned Saxon pit has had half its backfill removed and we can clearly see a difference between the ground the pit was cut into and the material originally filling the pit. Sometimes these differences are not clear and an archaeologist must rely on experience and insight to discover cuts.\n\nRe-cuts are cuts made within the confines or near confines of other cuts, often to regain the function of the original cut or harvest material from the original fill. Re-cuts are considered quite valuable as a source of information because they can shed insight on function and attitude over time. An example of re-cutting would be a roadside ditch being re-cut and emptied of silt and detritus as a form of maintenance. Conversely, a roadside ditch that is never re-cut gives a certain impression about the attitude towards the investment in infrastructure the road represents. Re-cuts by their nature are hard to discern because the re-cut can truncate the original cut in part and be completely in the confines of the original fill in other parts. They can even be absent from the record. Cutting is the reason why not all past activity on a site leaves traces of its existence in the sequence.\nFig 2 shows how a ditch cut with at least two re-cuts may appear when viewed in section. It is possible that numerous other re-cuts took place and were truncated out of the archaeological record by one or more of the re-cuts that has survived.\n\n\n"}

His writings served to promote Swedish National Romanticism. He also was an influential advocate of Liberalism.\n\nGeijer was born at Geijersgården, his family's estate in Ransäter, Värmland. He was educated at the gymnasium of Karlstad, and then attended the University of Uppsala, where he earned his master's degree in 1806. In 1803 he had competed successfully for an historical prize offered by the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm. In 1809, he traveled in England. The year following, he became a lecturer in history at Uppsala, and in 1815 assistant to Eric Michael Fant. Succeeding Fant, Geijer was a professor of history from 1817 at Uppsala University where a statue now commemorates him. He was rector of Uppsala University during the years 1822, 1830, 1836 and 1843-1844. As a representative of the university, he was a member of the Church of Sweden clergy: 1828-30 and 1840-41. He was a member of the Swedish Academy (on seat 14) from 1824. In 1835, he became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nGeijer was also a founding member of the Geatish Society (). In the first issue of its periodical, \"Iduna,\" appeared Geijer's most famous poem \"The Viking\" (), which described the Viking as the heroic Norseman that many of us might imagine today and was a turning-point in the rehabilitation of Norse culture among the Swedish people. Geijer also collaborated with Arvid August Afzelius, in the three volume collection of Swedish folk-songs, \"Svenska folk-visor från forntiden\" (Stockholm, 1814–1816).\n\nGeijer was also a noted historian, although he did not complete any one of the vast undertakings which he planned. Of the \"Records of Sweden\" (), which were to have embraced the history of his native country from mythical ages to his own times, he finished only the introductory volume. His \"Svenska folkets historia\" (3 vols., 1832–36), which was intended to form one of the series of European histories edited by Leo and Ukert, was not carried beyond the abdication of Queen Christina (1654), the reason probably being the author's conversion to liberalism in history and politics. It has been suggested, however, that Geijer’s declaring for liberalism was perhaps as much coming-out-of-the-closet as it was a true conversion. Incomplete as they are, these works are highly regarded contributions to Swedish history. His \"History of the Swedes down to Charles X\" was translated into English by Turner, with biographical introduction (London, 1845).\n\nGeijer was entrusted the task of examining and editing the papers which Gustavus III had bequeathed to the University of Uppsala, with the stipulation that they were not to be opened for fifty years after his death. In fulfillment of his charge, Geijer arranged these papers in a work which appeared in 1843-45 under the title of \"Gusstaf III's efterlemnade papper\", but they contained little or nothing of value.\n\nAlthough he rose to fame as a nationalist author, Geijer's views changed during his lifetime. During the last ten years of his life, he took an active part in politics, and began to advocate social reform and Liberalism. Although his political writings possess great merit, the very versatility of his powers diverted him from applying them methodically to the complete elaboration of any one subject.\n\nIn 1846 increasing ill health forced him to resign his position as professor at Uppsala. He died in Stockholm. He left some personal memoirs, \"Minnen\" (Upsala, 1834). His collected works, \"Samlade Skrifter\", with a bibliographic treatise by Teodblad (8 vols.), appeared at Stockholm (1873–75).\n\nGeijersgården is a historic mansion centrally located in Uppsala, north of the Uppsala University library. Geijersgården is named after Erik Gustaf Geijer, who lived there from 1837 to 1846. The main building was built between 1737-38. The estate gained its present appearance around 1850.\n\nIn 1934, the estate was taken over by Uppsala University and since 1965 has housed the Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation (\"Hammarskjöldfonden\"). The building was restored in the 1983 after a fire in which the building's western parts were badly damaged. The buildings are classified as historic properties under the Swedish Cultural Monuments Act (\"Kulturminneslagen\"). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrief biographical treatises were also written by Malmstroem (Upsala, 1848), Fries (Stockholm, 1849), and Carlson (Stockholm, 1870).\n\n"}

Charles and Hannah de Labilliere travelled in the \"Westminster\", the second ship which sailed from England direct for the Port Phillip District, and landed in Melbourne in December 1839. Charles de Labilliere engaged in pastoral pursuits at Tallook Yale, near Bacchus Marsh, and later died in London on 2 November 1870.\n\nFrancis Labilliere, went to England with his father in 1859; entered at the Middle Temple on 7 November 1860; called to the bar on 6 June 1863; married at St. Saviour's, Paddington, on 9 October 1867, Adelaide, eldest daughter of the late Rev. Edward Ravenshaw, rector of West Rington, Wiltshire. Labilliere always took a deep interest in the relations of the mother country and the colonies, and was one of the very earliest advocates of Imperial Federation, developing his views on the question in a succession of papers, the first at the Social Science Congress at Bristol, in 1869, on \"The Future Relations of England and her Colonies\"; the second at the Colonial Conference, Westminster Palace Hotel, in 1871, of which he was honorary secretary, on \"Imperial and Colonial Federalism\"; the two next before the Royal Colonial Institute, in 1875 on \"The Permanent Unity of the Empire\"; and in 1881 on \"The Political Organisation of the Empire\". Labilliere again opened the question before the Social Science Congress at Birmingham, in 1884, and before the conference arranged by the Royal Colonial Institute at the Colonial Exhibition of 1886. He also combated the views of Goldwin Smith and other advocates of disintegration, in an article on \"The Contraction of England, and its Advocates,\" in the National Review, in 1884. In that year also, on his suggestion, the first steps were taken to found the Imperial Federation League, he being honorary secretary to the provisional committee, and afterwards, jointly with Mr. Arnold Forster, to the League, on its establishment. From 1874 to 1881, as a member of the council of the Royal Colonial Institute, he assisted Sir Frederick Young in the honorary secretarial work of the society before it was in a position to maintain a paid staff. As appears by the correspondence laid before Parliament in 1876, he was the first to suggest the annexation of Eastern New Guinea, in a long letter addressed in 1874 to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a copy of which was sent, with a covering despatch, by Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon to each of the governors of the Australian colonies.\n\nIn 1878 Labilliere's \"Early History of the Colony of Victoria\" appeared, in two volumes. It corrected the previously received date of the discovery of Port Phillip Bay, and brought to light many facts and documents which had been forgotten, or never before made public. de Labilliere resided at Harrow in his latter years and died there on 19 February 1895.\n\n\n"}

His father was a white plantation overseer, his coloured mother worked in the oil industry. After the early separation of his parents, he grew up in the Catholic, Patois-speaking household of his maternal grandmother. After elementary school, he attended St. Thomas High School in Belmont until the age of 15 when he started working in insurance and in manufacturing companies. After he received an inheritance on the death of his grandmother he travelled to Europe and Great Britain where he unavailingly tried to gain ground as a painter and writer. After his return to Trinidad, he worked as a copywriter for various advertising agencies. In the late 1960s, he attracted attention by using black models to advertise high-priced products, a novelty in Trinidad. In 1973, he founded his own advertising agency together with Clive Bradley. In the same year, he married Sheelagh Hezekiah with whom he has three sons. From 1979 until 1985, he served for seven years on the St. Augustine Campus Council of the University of the West Indies (UWI). At the beginning of the 1980s, Besson was a member of a circle of writers and historians around Olga Mavrogordato, widow of Colonel Arthur Stephen Mavrogordato. This group, of which Anthony de Verteuil und Michael Anthony were also members, was dedicated to publishing works about the history and cultural traditions of Trinidad and Tobago. In 1981, Besson founded the publishing company Paria Publishing, initially focussed on republishing of out-of-print works on the history of Trinidad and Tobago. In the following 35 years, he produced and published more than 130 books, many of which non-fiction books by Trinidadian historians. From 1982 to 1985, Besson was a director of the National Museum and Art Gallery in Port of Spain. In 1995, Besson's advertising agency was acquired by Lonsdale Saatchi & Saatchi; Besson himself remained as creative director. In 1996, he got divorced from his first wife, and, in 1998, he married German-born Alice Schwarz.\n\nBesson retired from Lonsdale Saatchi & Saatchi in 2002 but continued to contribute to the cultural life in Trinidad. In the 2000s, he curated exhibitions in several museums such as in the Museum at the House of Angostura (2001–2003), in the Heritage Library (2004) and in the National Museum and Art Gallery (2007). In 2005, he was appointed to the board of the National Trust and served on the advisory council for the setting up of an Academy of Arts, Letters, Culture and Public Affairs of the University of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2011, he was appointed to serve on the Equal Opportunities Commission by Trinidadian president George Maxwell Richards and continued to work for the commission until 2014.\n\nBesson is a member of the Association of Caribbean Historians.\n\nBesson's works as a historian cover various aspects of Trinidadian and Tobagonian history and culture which can partly be traced back to research assignments from various companies and institutions. A core element of his fictional work is the history of the Afro-French-Creole presence in Trinidad and Tobago and the wider Caribbean, the ethnic group from which his family originates. This topic is being dealt with in his novels \"The Voice in the Govi\" and \"From the Gates of Aksum\". The storylines of his novels are fictitious, but the backgrounds are historical, especially in \"Roume de St. Laurent … A Memoir\". This novel depicts the life of Philippe Rose Roume de Saint-Laurent, a French adventurer who had a significant influence on the development of Spanish Trinidad in the late 18th century. Roume was instrumental in the promulgation of the \"cedula de populacion\" of 1783 in the Caribbean, an edict of Spanish minister José de Gálvez y Gallardo that allowed for the settlement of Catholics in Trinidad. This edict created a remarkable increase in the population of the island, mostly French-speaking colonists.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, Besson wrote and produced \"The Land of Beginnings\", a monthly supplement to Trinidadian newspaper Newsday that dealt with historical topics and appeared for 24 months. Trinidadian TV channel TTT financed the production of \"The Land of Beginnings\" as a threepart documentary. His 2010 non-fiction book \"The Cult of Will\" was the subject of controversy, as it sought to deconstruct the narrative of former Trinidad and Tobago prime minister Eric Williams with regard to the emancipation of the slaves in the British Empire.\n\nBesson maintains the \"Caribbean History Archives\", a private weblog where he collects new findings on Trinidadian history.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7327635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7327635", "title": "Heinrich Fichtenau", "text": "Heinrich Fichtenau\n\nHeinrich von Fichtenau (December 10, 1912 – June 15, 2000) was an Austrian medievalist best known for his studies of medieval diplomatics, social, and intellectual history. He spent his academic career at the University of Vienna and from 1962 to 1983 served as director of the Institut für österreichische Geschichtsforschung (Institute for Austrian Historical Research). Many of Fichtenau's books were translated into English and he remains one of the few Austrian medievalists of the postwar period whose work has enjoyed a broad and influential reception in Anglophone scholarship.\n\nBorn in Linz to a prosperous family, Fichtenau entered the University of Vienna in 1931 and completed the archivists' training course at the Institut für österreichische Geschichtsforschung in 1935. He subsequently continued on for his doctoral degree, awarded in 1940, under the Institute's director Hans Hirsch, and wrote his Habilitation thesis while serving on the Eastern Front in the German Wehrmacht during World War II. Published in 1946 as \"Mensch und Schrift im Mittelalter\" (\"Man and Writing in the Middle Ages\"), this Habilitation established Fichtenau's reputation as an authority on the social and cultural contexts of literacy and documentary practice in the Middle Ages. In 1949, Fichtenau published a short treatment of the Carolingian Empire which drew sharp criticism from German academics, but found more favorable reception in the U.S. and Great Britain (\"The Carolingian Empire: The Age of Charlemagne\", abridged trans. Peter Munz, 1957). Fichtenau attempted to demythologize Charlemagne's achievements and draw out many of the contradictions and fundamental instabilities within the empire he created. Written in post-war Vienna, the book was a frank, if understandably cynical, take on historical narratives of the early Middle Ages which celebrated power, conquest, and the idealized image of a pan-European polity. Fichtenau was appointed Extraordinary (Associate) Professor of History at Vienna in 1950, and received a promotion to a full professorial chair (Ordinarius) in 1963, at which time he also assumed the director's position at the Institute. \n\nFichtenau taught primarily in the field of ancillary historical sciences (Historische Hilfswissenschaften), a set of disciplines that encompasses the technical study of medieval historical sources, such as paleography, diplomatics, epigraphy, sigilography, and heraldry. Much of his published work in German relates to understanding how the forms of documentation and writing in the Middle Ages reflect social and cultural change. Between 1950 and 1955 Fichtenau, along with his colleague Erich Zöllner, published the diplomas of the House of Babenberg. In a series of studies entitled \"Arenga: Spätantike und Mittelalter im Spiegel von Urkundenformeln\" (Cologne & Vienna, 1957), Fichtenau traced shifts in the self-representation of medieval rulers in the rhetoric of the introductory clauses of their diplomas. In 1971, he published \"Das Urkundenwesen in Österreich vom 8. bis zum frühen 13. Jahrhundert\" (Cologne & Vienna), a still unsurpassed analysis of the various forms, and—more importantly—social and cultural significance, of medieval charters from institutions and collections in southern Germany and Austria. \n\nFichtenau's landmark monographic study, \"Lebensordnungen des 10. Jahrhunderts\", appeared in 1984 and was later translated into English by the American medievalist Patrick J. Geary as \"Living in the Tenth Century: Mentalities and Social Orders\" (Chicago & London, 1991). In it, Fichtenau explored the political, religious and social value systems of a period that many (including historians) still characterize as primitive, violent, and mostly unknown—the so-called \"Dark Ages.\" In focusing on perceptions of order, rather than traditional political narratives, Fichtenau's work resonated more with the interdisciplinary Anglo-French approaches to medieval social history than the traditions of legal and institutional history characteristic of much German-language historiography at the time.\n\nIn 1983, Fichtenau retired and passed the directorship of the Viennese Institute on to his pupil and protégé, Herwig Wolfram. In retirement throughout the 80's and 90's, he remained an active scholar. In 1991, he produced a wide-ranging intellectual/religious study of the concomitant emergence of heretical movements and scholasticism in medieval Europe after the eleventh century, translated into English as \"Heretics and Scholars in the High Middle Ages, 1000-1200\" (Philadelphia, 1998). He fell suddenly ill in the spring of 2000 and died several days later at the age of 88. Fichtenau is buried at his family's crypt in the town of Baden, near Vienna.\n\n\n"}

Papanikolas\n\nHelen Zeese Papanikolas (June 29, 1917 – October 31, 2004) was a Greek-American ethnic historian, novelist and folklorist who documented the immigrant experience in Utah and the American West through histories, memoirs, fiction, and poetry. Her ethnographic themes drew upon her experience as a Greek-American in a small western community.\n\nHelen Zeese was born in the mining community of Cameron (near Castle Gate) in Carbon County, Utah, to Greek immigrant parents George and Emily Zeese (originally Yiorgis and Emilia Zisimopoulos). The family moved to nearby Helper and, in 1933, to Salt Lake City, Utah where they established a chain of grocery stores. In her youth, Zeese attended Helper Central School and Carbon High School while living in Carbon County, and East High School in Salt Lake City.\n\nWhile attending the University of Utah, Zeese served as editor of the campus literary magazine \"Pen\" and associated with several other students who would become prominent in the field of western history. These included historian and archivist Dale Morgan. She graduated with a B.A. from the University in 1939. She married Nick E. Papanikolas and the couple had two children, Zeese and Thalia.\n\nIn 1984, the University of Utah awarded Papanikolas an honorary doctorate. She and her husband established scholarship programs for minority students at the University of Utah and the College of Eastern Utah. Papanikolas died in November 2004.\n\nIn 1950, Papanikolas was asked to write about Greek communities for the Utah Historical Quarterly. The subsequent 1954 article \"The Greeks of Carbon County\" broadened the scope of published Utah history, which had previously focused on settlement and progress of the administration and membership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). The article contributed to a fuller understanding of Utah’s cultural and ethnic heritage and served as a lasting example for local ethnic historians. For fifty years, her works on ethnic history were published in the Utah Historical Quarterly and Western Humanities Review. She wrote seven books, both fiction and non-fiction. Publications also include historical monographs and anthologies such as \"Toil and Rage in a New Land: The Greek Immigrants of Utah\" (1970) and \"The Peoples of Utah\" (1976). Papanikolas' skill as a novelist and storyteller was demonstrated in \"The Time of the Little Black Bird\", which won the Utah Fiction Prize for 2000. \nDuring her research, Papanikolas collected numerous primary documents and conducted extensive interviews with immigrants and historians. She was instrumental in organizing and contributing to an ethnic archive at the Oral History Archives, Marriott Library, University of Utah. Selected papers are also held in The Helen Z. Papanikolas Oral Histories Collection, 1969–1974, Utah State Historical Society, in Salt Lake City and in the Immigration History Research Center, College of Liberal Arts, at the University of Minnesota. Her years of fieldwork and extensive archival work on Greek America led to Papanikolas’ reputation as a leading authority on Greek immigrant life in the United States. She presented papers at national and international conferences and served as a consultant for television documentaries and other projects.\n\nIn 1977, Papanikolas was a founder and first president of \"The Peoples of Utah Institute\". As president, she located and identified artifacts associated with ethnic life, produced a major museum exhibit, and sponsored lectures and other programs. Her efforts at the institute led to the establishment of the \"Hellenic Cultural Museum\" in Salt Lake City. She also served on the Children's Service Society Board (1962–69); Advisory Board of Editors, Utah Historical Quarterly (1969–73); Board of State History (1973–85); and Utah Endowment for the Humanities State Committee (1973–79).\n\nAwards for her contribution to cultural history include: :\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2009 their manifesto was published in \"Intentism - The Resurrection of the author\".\n\nIntentists come from a variety of backgrounds but are all questioning ideas related to the meaning of work. The name Intentism is a response to the debate around authorial intent. In the public debates that launched intentism, Vittorio Pelosi cited four key schools that the new movement sought to challenge. These include the so-called \"The Intentional Fallacy\" published by Monroe Beardley and William Wimsatt, which maintained that \"The design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art.\" There is also the case of the French philosopher Roland Barthes, who, in 1967, declared that the author is dead and that his work is nothing but a \"tissue of quotations\" and that the impression of the reader is more important. He also cited Jacques Derrida's deconstruction theory, which critiques the relationship of text and meaning, and exposes meaning that run counter to what was intended by the author. Finally, Pelosi identified Hans-Georg Gadamer's theory that a text's meaning can change over time due to the changes that transpire in society. According to the thinker, these theories are outdated and that there is an imperative to identify, celebrate, and recognize the relationship between the artist and his creation because \"all meaning is the imperfect outworking of intention.\" \n\nIntentists believe that art can convey an artist's intended message to his or her intended audience. As a movement it both recognizes and celebrates the relationship between an artist's creation and its creator.\nIntentists believe three principles:\n\nIntentism has been the subject of several public debates. In 2009 The University of the Arts London held a Panel Discussion around Intentism entitled 'Intentism: Is an artist free to convey his or her intended message? In 2011, The Royal College of Art, held a debate on Intentism named 'Rebirth of the Author?' Intentists have also given several Lectures at various art institutions including The University of East London and the University of Kent.\nIntentist artists work in numerous ways, but at present there appears to be three areas that are of particular interest. Firstly, Intentists often celebrate the artist's intentions in the work by including the entire process of creating art in the final piece. Consequently, elements of every editing decision is left in. Intentists call this process \"Palimpsestism\" and the \"Intentional Trail\".\nSecondly, since authorial irony can only be understood by comparing what is said (the work), and what is meant (author intent), it is a common subject for Intentist artists. An example here would be Luciano Pelosi’s Big Breakfast. Thirdly, much art theory finds its origin in Literary theory. It is a claim of the Intentists that in certain fundamental areas this cross over is not valid. In literature the author has a linear order expectation for the text since the viewer will normally start at the beginning and read letters sequentially until the end. However, this approach is not appropriate for the static arts. Most paintings and sculptures are anarrative as viewers can approach the work in multiple orders. Therefore, this basis for ignoring the artist’s intentions is not relevant. An example of an Intentist artist creating work to demonstrate these anarrative properties is Govinda Sah.\n\nVittorio Pelosi's painting The School of Postmodernism, inspired by Raphael's The School of Athens, is one of the best known paintings to come out of the Intentist movement and replaces all of Raphael's Athenian philosophers with Postmodern icons. Each figure is attempting an objective depiction of the life model, but their work is subjected to their postmodernist ideologies.\n\nIntentists regularly exhibit their work, both in solo Intentist exhibitions and Intentist group shows.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14573", "title": "Isaac Asimov", "text": "Isaac Asimov\n\nIsaac Asimov (; January 2, 1920 – April 6, 1992) was an American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University. He was known for his works of science fiction and popular science. Asimov was a prolific writer who wrote or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. His books have been published in 9 of the 10 major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification.\n\nAsimov wrote hard science fiction. Along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, Asimov was considered one of the \"Big Three\" science fiction writers during his lifetime. Asimov's most famous work is the \"Foundation\" series; his other major series are the \"Galactic Empire\" series and the Robot series. The Galactic Empire novels are set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with \"Foundation and Earth\" (1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot stories, creating a unified \"future history\" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and previously produced by Cordwainer Smith and Poul Anderson. He wrote hundreds of short stories, including the social science fiction novelette \"Nightfall\"; in 1964, it was voted the best short science fiction story of all time by the Science Fiction Writers of America. Asimov wrote the \"Lucky Starr\" series of juvenile science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.\n\nAsimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as much nonfiction. Most of his popular science books explain concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. Examples include \"Guide to Science\", the three-volume set \"Understanding Physics\", and \"Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery\", as well as works on chemistry, astronomy, mathematics, history, and William Shakespeare's writings.\n\nHe was president of the American Humanist Association. The asteroid 5020 Asimov, a crater on the planet Mars, a Brooklyn elementary school, and a literary award are named in his honor.\n\nAsimov's family name derives from \"azimy\", a word for the winter crops in which his great-grandfather dealt, with the Russian patronymic ending \"-ov\" added. Azimov is spelled in the Cyrillic alphabet. When the family arrived in the United States in 1923 and their name had to be spelled in Western letters, Asimov's father spelled it with an S, believing this letter to be pronounced like Z (as in German), and so it became Asimov. This later inspired one of Asimov's short stories, \"Spell My Name with an S.\"\n\nAsimov refused early suggestions of using a more common name as a pseudonym, and believed that its recognizability helped his career. After becoming famous, he often met readers who believed that \"Isaac Asimov\" was a distinctive pseudonym created by an author with a common name.\n\nAsimov was born in Petrovichi, Smolensk Oblast, Russia on an unknown date between October 4, 1919 and January 2, 1920, inclusive. Asimov celebrated his birthday on January 2.\n\nAsimov's parents were Anna Rachel (née Berman) and Judah Asimov, a family of Jewish millers. He was named Isaac after his mother's father, Isaac Berman. When he was born, his family lived in Petrovichi near Klimovichi, which was then Gomel Governorate in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (now Smolensk Oblast, Russia). Asimov wrote of his father, \"My father, for all his education as an Orthodox Jew, was not Orthodox in his heart\", noting that \"he didn't recite the myriad prayers prescribed for every action, and he never made any attempt to teach them to me\".\n\nIn 1921, Asimov and 16 other children in Petrovichi developed double pneumonia. Only Asimov survived. He later had two younger siblings: a sister, Marcia (born Manya, June 17, 1922 – April 2, 2011), and a brother, Stanley (July 25, 1929 – August 16, 1995), who was vice-president of \"New York Newsday\".\n\nAsimov's family travelled to the United States via Liverpool on the SS \"Baltic\", arriving on February 13, 1923 when he was three years old. Since his parents always spoke Yiddish and English with him, he never learned Russian, but he remained fluent in Yiddish as well as English. Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, Asimov taught himself to read at the age of five, and his mother got him into first grade a year early by claiming he was born on September 7, 1919. In third grade he learned about the \"error\" and insisted on an official correction of the date to January 2.\n\nAfter becoming established in the U.S., his parents owned a succession of candy stores in which everyone in the family was expected to work. The candy stores sold newspapers and magazines, a fact that Asimov credited as a major influence in his lifelong love of the written word, as it presented him with an unending supply of new reading material as a child that he could not have otherwise afforded. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1928 at the age of eight.\n\nAsimov attended New York City public schools from age 5, including Boys High School in Brooklyn. Graduating at 15, he attended the City College of New York for several days before accepting a scholarship at Seth Low Junior College, a branch of Columbia University in Downtown Brooklyn designed to absorb some of the Jewish and Italian-American students who applied to Columbia College, then the institution's primary undergraduate school for men with quotas on the number of admissions from those ethnic groups. Originally a zoology major, Asimov switched to chemistry after his first semester as he disapproved of \"dissecting an alley cat\". After Seth Low Junior College closed in 1938, Asimov finished his Bachelor of Science degree at University Extension (later the Columbia University School of General Studies) in 1939.\n\nAfter two rounds of rejections by medical schools, in 1939, Asimov applied to the graduate program in chemistry at Columbia; initially rejected and then accepted only on a probationary basis, he completed his Master of Arts degree in chemistry in 1941 and earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree in biochemistry in 1948.\n\nIn between earning these two degrees, Asimov spent three years during World War II working as a civilian chemist at the Philadelphia Navy Yard's Naval Air Experimental Station, living in the Walnut Hill section of West Philadelphia from 1942 to 1945. In September 1945, he was drafted into the U.S. Army; if he had not had his birth date corrected while at school, he would have been officially 26 years old and ineligible. In 1946, a bureaucratic error caused his military allotment to be stopped, and he was removed from a task force days before it sailed to participate in Operation Crossroads nuclear weapons tests at Bikini Atoll. He served for almost nine months before receiving an honorable discharge on July 26, 1946. He had been promoted to corporal on July 11.\n\nAfter completing his doctorate and a postdoc year, Asimov joined the faculty of the Boston University School of Medicine in 1949 with a $5,000 salary (), with which he remained associated thereafter. By 1952, however, he was making more money as a writer than from the university, and he eventually stopped doing research, confining his university role to lecturing students. In 1955 he was promoted to associate professor, which gave him tenure. In December 1957 Asimov was dismissed from his teaching post, with effect from 30 June 1958, because he had stopped doing research. After a struggle which lasted for two years he kept his title, and on 18 October 1979, the university honored his writing by promoting him to full professor of biochemistry. Asimov's personal papers from 1965 onward are archived at the university's Mugar Memorial Library, to which he donated them at the request of curator Howard Gotlieb.\n\nIn 1959, after a recommendation from Arthur Obermayer, Asimov's friend and a scientist on the U.S. missile protection project, Asimov was approached by DARPA to join Obermayer's team. Asimov declined on the grounds that his ability to write freely would be impaired should he receive classified information. However, he did submit a paper to DARPA titled \"On Creativity\" containing ideas on how government-based science projects could encourage team members to think more creatively.\n\nAsimov married Gertrude Blugerman (1917, Toronto, Canada – 1990, Boston, U.S.) on July 26, 1942. The couple lived in an apartment in West Philadelphia, while Asimov was employed at the Philadelphia Navy Yard (where two of his co-workers were L. Sprague de Camp and Robert A. Heinlein). They moved to Boston in May 1949, then to nearby suburbs Somerville in July 1949, Waltham in May 1951, and finally West Newton in 1956. They had two children, David (born 1951) and Robyn Joan (born 1955). In 1970, they separated, and Asimov moved back to New York, this time to the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where he lived for the rest of his life. He immediately began seeing Janet O. Jeppson and married her on November 30, 1973, two weeks after his divorce from Gertrude.\n\nAsimov was a claustrophile: he enjoyed small, enclosed spaces. In the third volume of his autobiography, he recalls a childhood desire to own a magazine stand in a New York City Subway station, within which he could enclose himself and listen to the rumble of passing trains while reading.\n\nAsimov was afraid of flying, doing so only twice: once in the course of his work at the Naval Air Experimental Station and once returning home from Oahu in 1946. Consequently, he seldom traveled great distances. This phobia influenced several of his fiction works, such as the Wendell Urth mystery stories and the \"Robot\" novels featuring Elijah Baley. In his later years, Asimov found enjoyment traveling on cruise ships, beginning in 1972 when he viewed the Apollo 17 launch from a cruise ship. On several cruises, he was part of the entertainment program, giving science-themed talks aboard ships such as the RMS \"Queen Elizabeth II\".\n\nAsimov was an able public speaker and was a frequent fixture at science fiction conventions, where he was friendly and approachable. He patiently answered tens of thousands of questions and other mail with postcards and was pleased to give autographs. He was of medium height, stocky, with - in his later years - \"mutton-chop\" sideburns, and a distinct New York accent. His physical dexterity was very poor. He never learned to swim or ride a bicycle; however, he did learn to drive a car after he moved to Boston. In his humor book \"Asimov Laughs Again\", he describes Boston driving as \"anarchy on wheels.\"\n\nAsimov's wide interests included his participation in his later years in organizations devoted to the comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan and in The Wolfe Pack, a group of devotees of the Nero Wolfe mysteries written by Rex Stout. Many of his short stories mention or quote Gilbert and Sullivan. He was a prominent member of The Baker Street Irregulars, the leading Sherlock Holmes society, for whom he wrote an essay arguing that Professor Moriarty's work \"The Dynamics of An Asteroid\" involved the willful destruction of an ancient civilized planet. He was also a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of his fictional group of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers. He later used his essay on Moriarty's work as the basis for a Black Widowers story, \"The Ultimate Crime\", which appeared in \"More Tales of the Black Widowers\".\n\nIn 1984, the American Humanist Association (AHA) named him the Humanist of the Year. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. From 1985 until his death in 1992, he served as president of the AHA, an honorary appointment. His successor was his friend and fellow writer Kurt Vonnegut. He was also a close friend of \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry, and earned a screen credit as \"special science consultant\" on \"\" for advice he gave during production.\n\nAsimov was a founding member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, CSICOP (now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry) and is listed in its Pantheon of Skeptics. In a discussion with James Randi at CSICon 2016 regarding the founding of CSICOP, Kendrick Frazier said that Asimov was \"a key figure in the Skeptical movement who is less well known and appreciated today, but was very much in the public eye back then.\" He said that Asimov being associated with CSICOP \"gave it immense status and authority\" in his eyes.\n\nAsimov described Carl Sagan as one of only two people he ever met whose intellect surpassed his own. The other, he claimed, was the computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Marvin Minsky. Asimov was a long-time member and vice president of Mensa International, albeit reluctantly; he described some members of that organization as \"brain-proud and aggressive about their IQs\".\n\nIn 1977, Asimov suffered a heart attack. In December 1983, he had triple bypass surgery, during which he contracted HIV from a blood transfusion.\nWhen his HIV status was understood, his physicians warned that if he publicized it, the anti-AIDS prejudice would likely extend to his family members. He died in New York City on April 6, 1992 and was cremated.\n\nHe was survived by his siblings, his second wife Janet Asimov, and his children from his first marriage. His brother Stanley reported the cause of death as heart and kidney failure. The family chose not to disclose that these were complications of AIDS, because within two days, on April 8, Arthur Ashe announced his own HIV infection (also contracted in 1983 from a blood transfusion during heart bypass surgery), which resulted in much public controversy; also doctors continued to insist on secrecy. Ten years later, after most of Asimov's physicians had died, Janet and Robyn Asimov agreed that the HIV story should be made public; Janet revealed it in her edition of his autobiography, \"It's Been a Good Life\".\n\nAsimov's career can be divided into several periods. His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of \"The Naked Sun\" (1957). He began publishing nonfiction in 1952, co-authoring a college-level textbook called \"Biochemistry and Human Metabolism\". Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite Sputnik I by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly popular science books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of \"Foundation's Edge\". From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"Three Laws of Robotics\" and the \"Foundation\" series. Furthermore, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"robotics\", \"positronic\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"psychohistory\" (which is also used for a different study on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as mechanics and hydraulics, but for robots. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. \"\" featured androids with \"positronic brains\" and the first-season episode \"Datalore\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".\n\nAsimov became a science fiction fan in 1929, when he began reading the pulp magazines sold in his family's candy store. His father forbade reading pulps as he considered them to be trash, until Asimov persuaded him that because the science fiction magazines had \"Science\" in the title, they must be educational. At age 18 he joined the Futurians science fiction fan club, where he made friends who went on to become science fiction writers or editors.\n\nAsimov began writing at the age of 11. His first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for Boys High School's literary journal in 1934. In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On 17 May 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of \"Astounding Science Fiction\", Asimov visited its publisher Street & Smith Publications. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on 19 June 1938 and personally submitted it to \"Astounding\" editor John W. Campbell two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail. This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949; Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"Stowaway\". Campbell rejected it on 22 July but—in \"the nicest possible letter you could imagine\"—encouraged him to continue writing, promising that Asimov might sell his work after another year and a dozen stories of practice. In October 1938, he sold the third story he finished, \"Marooned Off Vesta\", to \"Amazing Stories\", edited by Raymond A. Palmer, and it appeared in the March 1939 issue. Asimov was paid $64 (), or one cent a word. Two more stories appeared that year, \"The Weapon Too Dreadful to Use\" in the May \"Amazing\" and \"Trends\" in the July \"Astounding\", the issue fans later selected as the start of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. For 1940, ISFDB catalogs seven stories in four different pulp magazines, including one in \"Astounding\". His earnings became enough to pay for his education, but not yet enough for him to become a full-time writer.\n\nAsimov later said that unlike other top Golden Age writers Robert Heinlein and A. E. van Vogt—also first published in 1939, and whose talent and stardom were immediately obvious—he \"(this is not false modesty) came up only gradually\". Through 29 July 1940, Asimov wrote 22 stories in 25 months, of which 13 were published; he wrote in 1972 that from that date he never wrote a science fiction story (except for two \"special cases\") that was not published. He was famous enough that Donald Wollheim told Asimov that he purchased \"The Secret Sense\" for a new magazine only because of his name, and the December 1940 issue of \"Astonishing\"—featuring Asimov's name in bold—was the first magazine to base cover art on his work, but Asimov later said that neither he himself nor anyone else—except perhaps Campbell—considered him better than an often published \"third rater\".\n\nBased on a conversation with Campbell, Asimov wrote his 32nd story in March and April 1941, which \"Astounding\" published in September 1941. In 1968 the Science Fiction Writers of America voted \"Nightfall\" the best science fiction short story ever written. In \"Nightfall and Other Stories\" Asimov wrote, \"The writing of 'Nightfall' was a watershed in my professional career. ... . I was suddenly taken seriously and the world of science fiction became aware that I existed. As the years passed, in fact, it became evident that I had written a 'classic'.\" \"Nightfall\" is an archetypal example of social science fiction, a term he created to describe a new trend in the 1940s, led by authors including him and Heinlein, away from gadgets and space opera and toward speculation about the human condition.\n\nAfter writing \"Victory Unintentional\" in January and February 1942, Asimov did not write another story for a year. Asimov expected to make chemistry his career, and was paid $2,600 annually at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, enough to marry his girlfriend; he did not expect to make much more from writing than the $1,788.50 he had earned from 28 stories sold over four years. Asimov left science fiction fandom and no longer read new magazines, and might have left the industry had not Heinlein and de Camp been coworkers and previously sold stories continued to appear. In 1942, Asimov published the first of his \"Foundation\" stories—later collected in the \"Foundation\" trilogy: \"Foundation\" (1951), \"Foundation and Empire\" (1952), and \"Second Foundation\" (1953). The books recount the fall of a vast interstellar empire and the establishment of its eventual successor. They also feature his fictional science of psychohistory, in which the future course of the history of large populations can be predicted. The trilogy and \"Robot \"series are his most famous science fiction. In 1966 they won the Hugo Award for the all-time best series of science fiction and fantasy novels. Campbell raised his rate per word, Orson Welles purchased rights to \"Evidence\", and anthologies reprinted his stories. By the end of the war Asimov was earning as a writer an amount equal to half of his Navy Yard salary, even after a raise, but Asimov still did not believe that writing could support him, his wife, and future children.\n\nHis \"positronic\" robot stories—many of which were collected in \"I, Robot\" (1950)—were begun at about the same time. They promulgated a set of rules of ethics for robots (see Three Laws of Robotics) and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject. Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection \"The Complete Robot\" (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a Frankenstein plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, Harlan Ellison wrote a screenplay of \"I, Robot\" that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile science fiction film ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994. The 2004 movie \"I, Robot\", starring Will Smith, was based on an unrelated script by Jeff Vintar titled \"Hardwired\", with Asimov's ideas incorporated later after the rights to Asimov's title were acquired. (The title was not original to Asimov but had previously been used for a story by Eando Binder.) Also, one of Asimov's robot short stories, \"The Bicentennial Man\", was expanded into a novel \"The Positronic Man\" by Asimov and Robert Silverberg, and this was adapted into the 1999 movie \"Bicentennial Man\", starring Robin Williams.\n\nBesides movies, his \"Foundation\" and \"Robot\" stories have inspired other derivative works of science fiction literature, many by well-known and established authors such as Roger MacBride Allen, Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, David Brin, and Donald Kingsbury. At least some of these appear to have been done with the blessing of, or at the request of, Asimov's widow, Janet Asimov.\n\nIn 1948, he also wrote a spoof chemistry article, \"The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline\". At the time, Asimov was preparing his own doctoral dissertation, and for the oral examination to follow that. Fearing a prejudicial reaction from his graduate school evaluation board at Columbia University, Asimov asked his editor that it be released under a pseudonym, yet it appeared under his own name. Asimov grew concerned at the scrutiny he would receive at his oral examination, in case the examiners thought he wasn't taking science seriously. At the end of the examination, one evaluator turned to him, smiling, and said, \"What can you tell us, Mr. Asimov, about the thermodynamic properties of the compound known as thiotimoline\". Laughing hysterically with relief, Asimov had to be led out of the room. After a five-minute wait, he was summoned back into the room and congratulated as \"Dr. Asimov\".\n\nDemand for science fiction greatly increased during the 1950s. It became possible for a genre author to write full-time. In 1949, book publisher Doubleday's science fiction editor Walter I. Bradbury accepted Asimov's unpublished \"Grow Old With Me\" (40,000 words), but requested that it be extended to a full novel of 70,000 words. The book appeared under the Doubleday imprint in January 1950 with the title of \"Pebble in the Sky\". Doubleday published five more original science fiction novels by Asimov in the 1950s, along with the six juvenile Lucky Starr novels, the latter under the pseudonym of \"Paul French\". Doubleday also published collections of Asimov's short stories, beginning with \"The Martian Way and Other Stories\" in 1955. The early 1950s also saw Gnome Press publish one collection of Asimov's positronic robot stories as \"I, Robot\" and his \"Foundation\" stories and novelettes as the three books of the \"Foundation trilogy\". More positronic robot stories were republished in book form as \"The Rest of the Robots\".\n\nBooks and the magazines \"Galaxy\", and \"Fantasy & Science Fiction\" ended Asimov's dependence on \"Astounding\". He later described the era as his \"'mature' period\". Asimov's \"The Last Question\" (1956), on the ability of humankind to cope with and potentially reverse the process of entropy, was his personal favorite story.\n\nIn 1972, his novel \"The Gods Themselves\" (which was not part of a series) was published to general acclaim, and it won the Hugo Award for Best Novel, the Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the Locus Award for Best Novel.\n\nIn December 1974, former Beatle Paul McCartney approached Asimov and asked him if he could write the screenplay for a science-fiction movie musical. McCartney had a vague idea for the plot and a small scrap of dialogue; he wished to make a film about a rock band whose members discover they are being impersonated by a group of extraterrestrials. The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney's group Wings, then at the height of their career. Intrigued by the idea, although he was not generally a fan of rock music, Asimov quickly produced a \"treatment\" or brief outline of the story. He adhered to McCartney's overall idea, producing a story he felt to be moving and dramatic. However, he did not make use of McCartney's brief scrap of dialogue, and probably as a consequence, McCartney rejected the story. The treatment now exists only in the Boston University archives.\n\nAsimov said in 1969 that he had \"the happiest of all my associations with science fiction magazines\" with \"Fantasy & Science Fiction\"; \"I have no complaints about \"Astounding\", \"Galaxy\", or any of the rest, heaven knows, but \"F & SF\" has become something special to me\". Beginning in 1977, Asimov lent his name to \"Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine\" (now \"Asimov's Science Fiction\") and penned an editorial for each issue. There was also a short-lived \"Asimov's SF Adventure Magazine\" and a companion \"Asimov's Science Fiction Anthology\" reprint series, published as magazines (in the same manner as the stablemates \"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine\"s and \"Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine\"s \"anthologies\").\n\nDue to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another book in his \"Foundation\" series, he did so with \"Foundation's Edge\" (1982) and \"Foundation and Earth\" (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with \"Prelude to Foundation\" (1988) and \"Forward the Foundation\" (1992), his last novel.\n\nDuring the late 1950s and 1960s, Asimov substantially decreased his fiction output (he published only four adult novels between 1957's \"The Naked Sun\" and 1982's \"Foundation's Edge\", two of which were mysteries). He greatly increased his nonfiction production, writing mostly on science topics; the launch of Sputnik in 1957 engendered public concern over a \"science gap\". Asimov explained in \"The Rest of the Robots\" that he had been unable to write substantial fiction since the summer of 1958, and observers understood him as saying that his fiction career had ended, or was permanently interrupted. Asimov recalled in 1969 that \"the United States went into a kind of tizzy, and so did I. I was overcome by the ardent desire to write popular science for an America that might be in great danger through its neglect of science, and a number of publishers got an equally ardent desire to publish popular science for the same reason\".\n\n\"Fantasy and Science Fiction\" invited Asimov to continue his regular nonfiction column, begun in the now-folded bimonthly companion magazine \"Venture Science Fiction Magazine\". The first of 399 monthly \"F&SF\" columns appeared in November 1958, until his terminal illness. These columns, periodically collected into books by Doubleday, gave Asimov a reputation as a \"Great Explainer\" of science; he described them as his only popular science writing in which he never had to assume complete ignorance of the subjects on the part of his readers. The column was ostensibly dedicated to popular science but Asimov had complete editorial freedom, and wrote about contemporary social issues in essays such as \"Thinking About Thinking\" and \"Knock Plastic!\".\n\nAsimov's first wide-ranging reference work, \"The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science\" (1960), was nominated for a National Book Award, and in 1963 he won a Hugo Award – his first – for his essays for \"F&SF\". The popularity of his science books and the income he derived from them allowed him to give up most academic responsibilities and become a full-time freelance writer. He encouraged other science fiction writers to write popular science, stating in 1967 that \"the knowledgeable, skillful science writer is worth his weight in contracts\", with \"twice as much work as he can possibly handle\".\n\nThe great variety of information covered in Asimov's writings prompted Kurt Vonnegut to ask, \"How does it feel to know everything?\" Asimov replied that he only knew how it felt to have the 'reputation' of omniscience: \"Uneasy\". Floyd C. Gale said that \"Asimov has a rare talent. He can make your mental mouth water over dry facts\", and \"science fiction's loss has been science popularization's gain\". Asimov said that \"Of all the writing I do, fiction, non-fiction, adult, or juvenile, these \"F & SF\" articles are by far the most fun\". He regretted, however, that he had less time for fiction—causing dissatisfied readers to send him letters of complaint—stating in 1969 that \"In the last ten years, I've done a couple of novels, some collections, a dozen or so stories, but that's \"nothing\"\".\n\nAsimov coined the term \"robotics\" in his 1941 story \"Liar!\", though he later remarked that he believed then that he was merely using an existing word, as he stated in \"Gold\" (\"The Robot Chronicles\"). While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, \"Astounding Science Fiction\", March 1942 printing of his short story \"Runaround\".\n\nAsimov also coined the term \"spome\" in a paper entitled, \"There's No Place Like Spome\" in \"Atmosphere in Space Cabins and Closed Environments\", originally presented as a paper to the American Chemical Society on September 13, 1965. It refers to any system closed with respect to matter and open with respect to energy capable of sustaining human life indefinitely.\n\nAsimov coined the term \"psychohistory\" in his \"Foundation\" stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines history, sociology, and mathematical statistics to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the Galactic Empire. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942–1944) which would later be collected as the 1951 novel \"Foundation\". Somewhat later, the term \"psychohistory\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including \"The Greeks: A Great Adventure\" (1965), \"The Roman Republic\" (1966), \"The Roman Empire\" (1967), \"The Egyptians\" (1967) \"The Near East: 10,000 Years of History\" (1968),\n\nHe published \"Asimov's Guide to the Bible\" in two volumes—covering the Old Testament in 1967 and the New Testament in 1969—and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including \"Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare\" (1970), \"Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost\" (1974), and \"The Annotated Gulliver's Travels\" (1980).\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to \"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine\". He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the Black Widowers, a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of limericks, mostly written by himself, starting with \"Lecherous Limericks\", which appeared in 1975. \"Limericks: Too Gross\", whose title displays Asimov's love of puns, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by John Ciardi. He even created a slim volume of Sherlockian limericks. Asimov featured Yiddish humor in \"Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon\". The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's \"Treasury of Humor\" is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on humor theory. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as \"The Sensuous Woman\" (by \"J\") and \"The Sensuous Man\" (by \"M\"), Asimov published \"The Sensuous Dirty Old Man\" under the byline \"Dr. 'A (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972). However, by 2016, some of Asimov's behavior towards women was described as sexual harassment and cited as an example of historically problematic behavior by men in science fiction communities.\n\nAsimov published three volumes of autobiography. \"In Memory Yet Green\" (1979) and \"In Joy Still Felt\" (1980) cover his life up to 1978. The third volume, \"I. Asimov: A Memoir\" (1994), covered his whole life (rather than following on from where the second volume left off). The epilogue was written by his widow Janet Asimov after his death. The book won a Hugo Award in 1995. Janet Asimov edited \"It's Been a Good Life\" (2002), a condensed version of his three autobiographies. He also published three volumes of retrospectives of his writing, \"Opus 100\" (1969), \"Opus 200\" (1979), and \"Opus 300\" (1984).\n\nIn 1987, the Asimovs co-wrote \"How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort\". In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement, distractions, rejection, and thick-headed editors. The book includes many quotations, essays, anecdotes, and husband-wife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author.\n\nAsimov and \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry developed a unique relationship during \"Star Trek\"s initial launch in the late 1960s. Asimov wrote a critical essay on \"Star Trek\"s scientific accuracy for \"TV Guide\" magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to \"TV Guide\" claiming that despite its inaccuracies, \"Star Trek\" was a fresh and intellectually challenging science fiction television show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of \"Star Trek\" projects.\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for calendar reform, called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A–D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter). An extra 'year day' is added for a total of 365 days.\n\nAsimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards.\nHe also received 14 honorary doctorate degrees from universities.\n\nAsimov wrote a typed first draft composed at the keyboard. He imagined an ending first, then a beginning, then \"let everything in-between work itself out as I come to it\". (Asimov only used an outline once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes. After disliking making multiple revisions of \"Black Friar of the Flame\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar James Gunn, professor emeritus of English at the University of Kansas wrote of \"I, Robot\":\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of \"Nemesis\":\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: Susan Calvin in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", Arkady Darell in \"Second Foundation\", Elijah Baley in \"The Caves of Steel\", and Hari Seldon in the \"Foundation\" prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's \"Dictionary of Literary Biography\" (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in \"The Caves of Steel\" \"reminiscent of Proust\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited Clifford D. Simak as an early influence), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed, Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated narrative structures, often by arranging chapters in nonchronological ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the nonlinearity is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of \"The Gods Themselves\" begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material. (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"Reason\", one of the early \"Robot\" stories. See \"In Memory Yet Green\" for details of that time period.) Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of \"The Currents of Space\" did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-kyrt Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. Asimov's tendency to contort his timelines is perhaps most apparent in his later novel \"Nemesis\", in which one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.\n\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\". He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of extraterrestrial life) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote \"The Gods Themselves\" to respond to these criticisms, which often came from New Wave science fiction (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when \"Astounding\"s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all. Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote \"The Gods Themselves\", which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1972, and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1973. Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of \"The Gods Themselves\", the part that deals with those themes.\n\nIn the Hugo Award-winning novella \"Gold\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (\"The Gods Themselves\") adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially photo-realistic computer animation. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.\n\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as \"Gold\" (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 \"Washington Post\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of \"Robots and Empire\" as follows:\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character Susan Calvin, a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.\n\nIsaac Asimov was an atheist, a humanist, and a rationalist. He did not oppose religious conviction in others, but he frequently railed against superstitious and pseudoscientific beliefs that tried to pass themselves off as genuine science. During his childhood, his father and mother observed Orthodox Jewish traditions, though not as stringently as they had in Petrovichi; they did not, however, force their beliefs upon young Isaac. Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the \"Torah\" represented Hebrew mythology in the same way that the \"Iliad\" recorded Greek mythology. When he was 13, he chose not to have a bar mitzvah. As his books \"Treasury of Humor\" and \"Asimov Laughs Again\" record, Asimov was willing to tell jokes involving God, Satan, the Garden of Eden, Jerusalem, and other religious topics, expressing the viewpoint that a good joke can do more to provoke thought than hours of philosophical discussion.\n\nFor a brief while, his father worked in the local synagogue to enjoy the familiar surroundings and, as Isaac put it, \"shine as a learned scholar\" versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of \"Asimov's Guide to the Bible\", an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an atheist; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"humanist\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to Jack Dann's anthology of Jewish science fiction, \"Wandering Stars\": \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the bar mitzvah. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,\n\nLikewise he said about religious education: \"I would not be satisfied to have my kids choose to be religious without trying to argue them out of it, just as I would not be satisfied to have them decide to smoke regularly or engage in any other practice I consider detrimental to mind or body.\"\n\nIn his last volume of autobiography, Asimov wrote,\n\nThe same memoir states his belief that Hell is \"the drooling dream of a sadist\" crudely affixed to an all-merciful God; if even human governments were willing to curtail cruel and unusual punishments, wondered Asimov, why would punishment in the afterlife not be restricted to a limited term? Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".\n\nAsimov said about using religious motifs in his writing:\n\nAsimov became a staunch supporter of the Democratic Party during the New Deal, and thereafter remained a political liberal. He was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed George McGovern. He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, \"In Joy Still Felt\", Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure Abbie Hoffman. Asimov's impression was that the 1960s' counterculture heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.\n\nAfter Asimov's name appeared in the mid-1960s on a list of people the Communist Party USA \"considered amenable\" to its goals, the FBI investigated him. Because of his academic background, the bureau briefly considered Asimov as a possible candidate for known Soviet spy ROBPROF, but found nothing suspicious in his life or background.\n\nThough from a Jewish family, Asimov appeared to hold an equivocal attitude towards Israel. In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a Zionist. In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it has been created among hostile neighbours, and that Jews have merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".\n\nAsimov believed that \"\"science\" fiction ... serve[s] the good of humanity\". He considered himself a feminist even before women's liberation became a widespread movement; he argued that the issue of women's rights was closely connected to that of population control. Furthermore, he believed that homosexuality must be considered a \"moral right\" on population grounds, as must all consenting adult sexual activity that does not lead to reproduction. He issued many appeals for population control, reflecting a perspective articulated by people from Thomas Malthus through Paul R. Ehrlich.\n\nIn a 1988 interview by Bill Moyers, Asimov proposed computer-aided learning, where people would use computers to find information on subjects in which they were interested. He thought this would make learning more interesting, since people would have the freedom to choose what to learn, and would help spread knowledge around the world. Also, the one-to-one model would let students learn at their own pace.\n\nAsimov's defense of civil applications of nuclear power even after the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant incident damaged his relations with some of his fellow liberals. In a letter reprinted in \"Yours, Isaac Asimov\", he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on Love Canal or near \"a Union Carbide plant producing methyl isocyanate\", the latter being a reference to the Bhopal disaster.\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the middle-class flight to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, \"Our Angry Earth\" (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author Frederik Pohl), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as overpopulation, oil dependence, war, global warming, and the destruction of the ozone layer. In response to being presented by Bill Moyers with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\nAsimov enjoyed the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, using \"The Lord of the Rings\" as a plot point in a Black Widowers story. (Tolkien said that he enjoyed Asimov's science fiction.) He acknowledged other writers as superior to himself in talent, saying of Harlan Ellison, \"He is (in my opinion) one of the best writers in the world, far more skilled at the art than I am.\" Asimov disapproved of the New Wave's growing influence, however, stating in 1967 \"I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\". The feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of Park Avenue\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book \"Report on Planet Three\" (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\". Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use Agatha Christie as my model. In my opinion, her mysteries are the best ever written, far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories, and Hercule Poirot is the best detective fiction has seen. Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?\" He enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, but considered Arthur Conan Doyle to be \"a slapdash and sloppy writer.\"\n\nPaul Krugman, holder of a Nobel Prize in Economics, has stated Asimov's concept of psychohistory inspired him to become an economist.\n\nJohn Jenkins, who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov's written output, once observed, \"It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style.\" Along with such figures as Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper, Asimov left his mark as one of the most distinguished interdisciplinarians of the 20th century. \"Few individuals\", writes , \"understood better than Isaac Asimov what synoptic thinking is all about. His almost 500 books—which he wrote as a specialist, a knowledgeable authority, or just an excited layman—range over almost all conceivable subjects: the sciences, history, literature, religion, and of course, science fiction.\" Asimov explained his quest for holistic knowledge:\n\n\nDepending on the counting convention used, and including all titles, charts, and edited collections, there may be currently over 500 books in Asimov's bibliography— as well as his individual short stories, individual essays, and criticism. For his 100th, 200th, and 300th books (based on his personal count), Asimov published \"Opus 100\" (1969), \"Opus 200\" (1979), and \"Opus 300\" (1984), celebrating his writing.\n\nAsimov was so prolific that his books span all major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification except for category 100, philosophy and psychology. Although Asimov did write several essays about psychology, and forewords for the books \"The Humanist Way\" (1988) and \"In Pursuit of Truth\" (1982), which were classified in the 100s category, none of his own books was classified in that category.\n\nAccording to UNESCO's \"Index Translationum database\", Asimov is the world's 24th most-translated author.\n\nAn online exhibit in West Virginia University Libraries' virtually complete Asimov Collection displays features, visuals, and descriptions of some of his over 600 books, games, audio recordings, videos, and wall charts. Many first, rare, and autographed editions are in the Libraries' Rare Book Room. Book jackets and autographs are presented online along with descriptions and images of children's books, science fiction art, multimedia, and other materials in the collection.\n\nFor a listing of Asimov's science fiction books in chronological order within his future history, see the \"Foundation\" series list of books.\n\nThe \"Robot\" series was originally separate from the \"Foundation\" series. The Galactic Empire novels were published as independent stories, set earlier in the same future as \"Foundation\". Later in life, Asimov synthesized the \"Robot\" series into a single coherent \"history\" that appeared in the extension of the \"Foundation\" series.\n\n\n\n\nNovels marked with an asterisk * have minor connections to the \"Foundation\" and \"Robot\" series.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollections of Asimov's essaysoriginally published as monthly columns in the \"Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\"\n\nOther science books by Asimov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1937, he became involved in a restoration project of an earthen lodge at Ocmulgee National Monument for the National Park Service. In the winter of 1939-40 he excavated the Medora Site for the Louisiana State Archaeological Survey, a joint project of Louisiana State University and the Work Projects Administration.

{"id": "1830287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1830287", "title": "Jet Age", "text": "Jet Age\n\nThe Jet Age is a period in the history of aviation defined by the advent of aircraft powered by turbine engines, and by the social change this brought about.\n\nJet airliners were able to fly much higher, faster, and farther than older pistonpowered propliners, making transcontinental and intercontinental travel considerably faster and easier: for example, aircraft leaving North America and crossing the Atlantic Ocean (and later, the Pacific Ocean) could now fly to their destinations non-stop, making much of the world accessible within a single day's travel for the first time. Since large jetliners could also carry more passengers than piston-powered airliners, air fares also declined (relative to inflation), so people from a greater range of socioeconomic classes could afford to travel outside their own countries.\n\nBesides the pure jet, the turbine driven propeller engines offered improvements of the piston engine delivering a smoother ride and better fuel efficiency. One exception to jet-powered domination by large airliners was the contra-rotating propellers turboprop design that powered the Tu-114 (first flight 1957). This airliner was able to match or even exceed the speed, capacity and range of contemporary jets; however, the use of such powerplants in large airframes was totally restricted to the military after 1976.\n\nThe introduction of the Concorde supersonic transport (SST) airliner to regular service in 1976 was expected to bring similar social changes, but the aircraft never found commercial success. After two and a half decades of service, a fatal crash near Paris in July 2000 and other factors eventually caused Concorde flights to be discontinued in 2003. This was the only loss of an SST in civilian service. Only one other SST design was used in a civilian capacity, the Soviet era Tu-144, but it was soon withdrawn due to high maintenance and other issues. McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and Boeing were three U.S. manufacturers that had originally planned to develop various SST designs since the 1960s, but these projects were eventually abandoned for various developmental, cost, and other practical reasons.\n\nThe term \"Jet Age\" was coined in the late 1940s. At the time, the only jet-powered aircraft in production were military types, most of which were fighters. The expression reflects the recognition that the jet engine had effected, or would soon, a profound change in aeronautics and aviation.\n\nOne view is that the jet age began with the invention of the jet engine in the 1930s and 1940s. In the history of military aviation it began in 1944 with the introduction into service of the Arado Ar 234 reconnaissance bomber and the Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter during World War II. In commercial aviation the jet age was introduced to Britain in 1952 with the first scheduled flight of the de Havilland Comet airliner and to America some years later with the first American-built jet airliners.\n\nThe British de Havilland Comet was the first jet airliner to fly (1949), the first in service (1952), and the first to offer a regular transatlantic service (1958). One hundred and fourteen of all versions were built. However, the first jet airliner to provide a sustained and dependable service was the Soviet Tupolev Tu-104 (201 built) which was the only jet airliner in operation worldwide between 1956 and 1958 (the Comet having been withdrawn in 1954 due to structural failure issues). The Comet and Tu-104 were later outstripped in production by the American Boeing 707 (which entered service in 1958) and Douglas DC-8, which joined it in the skies over the next few years. Other types of the period included the French Sud Aviation Caravelle.\n\nWhen the Boeing 707 began service on the New York to London route in 1958, this became the first year that more trans-Atlantic passengers traveled by air than by ship.\n\nAs the number of passengers soared, it became impractical to increase the number of aircraft flying from the major hub airports. Instead, designers created even larger widebody airliners and the engine manufacturers responded with larger, more powerful and also more fuel-efficient engines. The first \"jumbo jet\" was the Boeing 747, and it both increased airport passenger capacity and reduced the cost of air travel, further accelerating the social changes brought about by the Jet Age.\n\nMilitary aviation had entered the jet age somewhat earlier, during the closing stages of World War II. In the early postwar years, the increasing use of jet aircraft had little significant impact, serving mainly to continue the slow but steady improvements in performance seen in the past. Supersonic flight brought about a step change in aircraft performance. The Bell X-1, first to break the sound barrier in level flight, was an experimental rocket-powered type, and production jets which followed it into service could fly little faster. The first jet aircraft designed from the outset for supersonic flight was the British Fairey Delta 2. On March 10, 1956 it became the first aircraft to fly faster than 1,000 miles per hour, heralding an era of \"fast jets\" typically limited to a speed of Mach 2.2 by the engineering materials available. As jets became faster, their armament changed from guns to missiles. Avionics systems became more complex with radar, fire-control and other systems. Aircraft became larger and more expensive, and so were required to do more to make them economical. All this profoundly affected the nature of military strategy during the Cold War.\n\n"}
{"id": "11556381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11556381", "title": "Joseph Biner", "text": "Joseph Biner\n\nJoseph Biner (1697, Gluringen, Switzerland—March 24, 1766, Torrenburg, Germany) was a Roman Catholic canonist, historian, and theologian. His fame rests principally on his erudition abilities.\n\nBiner entered the Society of Jesus in 1715 and received the usual training of its members. He was later professor of canon law in the universities of Ingolstadt, Dillingen and Innsbruck. He entered zealously into all the controversies with the sectaries of his time, especially with the Swiss Protestants. As a consequence, all his works have a polemical tinge.\n\nIn 1739 appeared his \"Catholische Anmerkung über die neueste uncatholische Controvers-Schreiber\", directed against certain opponents in Zürich. This was followed in 1744 by \"Indifferentismus\", a treatise on religious indifference and liberalism in dogmatic teaching. Biner published \"Heiligkeit der Kirche\" in 1750, discussing the marks of the \"true Church\" and giving sketches of eminent Catholics. The best of his polemical works is \"De Summâ Trinitate, Fide Catholicâ et Hierarchiâ Ecclesiasticâ\". It appeared in 1765 and shows him at his best as a theologian and canonist. His last controversial treatise, which appeared the same year and was published like all the others at Vienna, is entitled: \"Kurzer Begriff der heutigen Glaubenstreitigkeiten\". It is an examination and refutation of various Protestant confessions of faith.\n\nBiner's chief work of a purely canonical character is \"Dissertationes juridicæ de beneficiis ecclesiasticis\" (Innsbruck, 1746). His masterpiece is the \"Apparatus erudictionis ad jurisprudentiam ecclesiasticam\". The work, despite its title, is not restricted to canon law, but is also historical, polemical, and theological. It was published at Vienna in eight quarto volumes from 1754 to 1766. It is a work of vast erudition and a storehouse of history and canon law. Dividing his material by centuries, Biner treats of the various species of law, of the history of the church councils, of the political and religious vicissitudes of the various nations, of treaties and concordats, etc. Interspersed in the work are many valuable excursuses on Jansenism, Probabilism, Public Penance, Origin of Imperial Electors, etc. However the work is rendered less valuable for students by a nonsystematic arrangement of material and the want of an index. The vastness of the knowledge which Biner displays, however, has received praise even from his opponents. He wrote many other works besides those mentioned, which may be found in De Backer and Sommervogel, cited below.\n\n"}

His best known work is \"The Third Eye\", published in Britain in 1956.\n\nFollowing the publication of the book, newspapers reported that Rampa was Cyril Henry Hoskin (8 April 1910 – 25 January 1981), a plumber from Plympton in Devon who claimed that his body hosted the spirit of a Tibetan lama going by the name of Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, who is purported to have authored the books. The name Tuesday relates to a claim in \"The Third Eye\" that Tibetans are named after the day of the week on which they were born.\n\nIn November 1956 a book called \"The Third Eye\" was published in the United Kingdom. It was written by a man named Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, and it purported to relate his experiences while growing up in Chakpori Lamasery, Chokpori, Tibet, after being sent there at the age of seven. The title of the book is derived from an operation, similar to trepanation, that Rampa claimed he had undergone, in which a small hole was drilled into his forehead to arouse the third eye and enhance powers of clairvoyance. The book describes the operation as follows:\n\nDuring the story, Rampa sees yetis and eventually encounters a mummified body of himself from an earlier incarnation. He also takes part in an initiation ceremony in which he learns that during its early history the Earth was struck by another planet, causing Tibet to become the mountain kingdom that it is today.\n\nThe manuscript of \"The Third Eye\" had been turned down by several leading British publishers before being accepted by Secker and Warburg for an advance of £800 (£ today). Fredric Warburg of Secker and Warburg had met the book's author, who at the time appeared in the guise of \"Doctor Carl Kuon Suo\". Intrigued by the writer's personality, Warburg sent the manuscript to a number of scholars, several of whom expressed doubts about its authenticity. Nevertheless, the book was published in November 1956 and soon became a global bestseller. The \"Times Literary Supplement\" said of the book: \"It came near to being a work of art.\"\n\nExplorer and Tibetologist Heinrich Harrer was unconvinced about the book's origins and hired a private detective from Liverpool named Clifford Burgess to investigate Rampa. \"In January 1957, Scotland Yard asked him to present a Tibetan passport or a residence permit. Rampa moved to Ireland. One year later, the scholars retained the services of Clifford Burgess, a leading Liverpool private detective. Burgess’s report, when it came in, was terse. Lama Lobsang Rampa of Tibet, he determined after one month of inquiries, was none other than Cyril Henry Hoskin, a native of Plympton, Devonshire, the son of the village plumber and a high school dropout.\" The findings of Burgess' investigation were published in the \"Daily Mail\" in February 1958. It was reported that the author of the book was a man named Cyril Henry Hoskin, who had been born in Plympton, Devon, in 1910 and was the son of a plumber. Hoskin had never been to Tibet and spoke no Tibetan. In 1948, he had legally changed his name to Carl Kuon Suo before adopting the name Lobsang Rampa. An obituary of Fra Andrew Bertie, Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, claims that he was involved in unmasking Lobsang Rampa as a West Country plumber.\n\nRampa was tracked by the British press to Howth, Ireland, and confronted with these allegations. He did not deny that he had been born as Cyril Hoskin, but claimed that his body was now occupied by the spirit of Lobsang Rampa. According to the account given in his third book, \"The Rampa Story\", he had fallen out of a fir tree in his garden in Thames Ditton, Surrey, while attempting to photograph an owl. He was concussed and, on regaining his senses, had seen a Buddhist monk in saffron robes walking towards him. The monk spoke to him about Rampa taking over his body and Hoskin agreed, saying that he was dissatisfied with his current life. When Rampa's original body became too worn out to continue, he took over Hoskin's body in a process of transmigration of the soul.\n\nRampa maintained for the rest of his life that \"The Third Eye\" was a true story. In the foreword to the 1964 edition of the book, he wrote:\nTo Donald S. Lopez, Jr., an American Tibetologist, the books of Lobsang Rampa are \"the works of an unemployed surgical fitter, the son of a plumber, seeking to support himself as a ghostwriter.\"\n\nThe authorship controversy was dramatised in a radio play, \"The Third Eye and the Private Eye\", by David Lemon and Mark Ecclestone, first broadcast by BBC Radio 4 in August 2012.\n\nDonald S. Lopez, Jr., in \"Prisoners of Shangri-La\" (1998), points out that when discussing Rampa with other tibetologists and buddhologists in Europe, he found that \"The Third Eye\" was the first book many of them had read about Tibet: \"For some it was a fascination with the world Rampa described that had led them to become professional scholars of Tibet.\"\n\nLopez adds that when he gave \"The Third Eye\" to a class of his at the University of Michigan without telling them about its history, the \"students were unanimous in their praise of the book, and despite six prior weeks of lectures and readings on Tibetan history and religion, [...] they found it entirely credible and compelling, judging it more realistic than anything they had previously read about Tibet.\"\n\nLobsang Rampa was a supporter of the Tibetan cause despite criticism of his books. In 1972, Rampa's French language agent Alain Stanké wrote to the Dalai Lama and asked for his opinion about Rampa's identity. He received a reply from the Dalai Lama's deputy secretary stating \"I wish to inform you that we do not place credence in the books written by the so-called Dr. T. Lobsang Rampa. His works are highly imaginative and fictional in nature.\" The Dalai Lama had previously admitted that although the books were fictitious, they had created good publicity for Tibet.\n\nLobsang Rampa went on to write another 18 books containing a mixture of religious and occult material. One of the books, \"Living with the Lama\", was described as being dictated to Rampa by his pet Siamese cat, Mrs. Fifi Greywhiskers. Faced with repeated accusations from the British press that he was a charlatan and a con artist, Rampa went to live in Canada in the 1960s. He and his wife, San Ra'ab, became Canadian citizens in 1973, along with Sheelagh Rouse (Buttercup) who was his secretary and regarded by Rampa as his adopted daughter.\n\nLobsang Rampa died in Calgary on 25 January 1981, at the age of 70.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was born in Prague to Count Jerzy Hutten-Czapski (1861-1930), and Jozefina Thun-Hohenstein (1867-1903), and grew up in Przyłuki, the family estate near Minsk. Her younger brother was Józef Czapski, and her relatives included Counts Emeryk Hutten-Czapski, Emeryk August Hutten-Czapski, and Karol Hutten-Czapski.\n\nCzapska studied in Krakow from 1921 to 1925, and moved to Paris afterwards, spending the next five years there writing a biography of Adam Mickiewicz. The biography, \"La vie de Mickiewicz\", published in 1931, was used for a time as a source in establishing Mickiewicz's ethnicity and origin, which remains under speculation. In 1938 she published her second work, \"Ludwik Śniadecka\", and received the literary prize \"Wiadomości Literackich\" for her efforts the following year.\n\nDuring World War II, Czapska lived in Poland, and was a member of the Żegota during this time; this led to her crossing the green border and moving to France in 1945, where she lived the rest of her life. For a short time, Czapska helped with the startup of Tygodnik Powszechny, and after moving to France she worked on Kultura, a Polish exile magazine. She was also a member of Polish Society of Arts and Sciences Abroad. During her time in exile, her works were subject to censorship, which was discovered after Tomasz Strzyżewski defected to Sweden, publishing the information which noted her name among many others. Later in life, she focused on literary works, namely \"Dwugłos wspomnień\", \"Europa w rodzinie\", and \"Czas odmieniony\". In 2014 two of her books, \"A Family of Central Europe\" and \"Through the Storm\" were published in one book for the first time in english.\n\n"}

Designated as America’s \"National Maritime Museum\" by Congress, it is one of the largest maritime museums in North America. The Mariners' Museum Library, contains the largest maritime history collection in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe museum was founded in 1930 by Archer Milton Huntington, son of Collis P. Huntington, a railroad builder who brought the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway to Warwick County, Virginia, and who founded the City of Newport News, its coal export facilities, and Newport News Shipbuilding in the late 19th century.\n\nHuntington and his wife, the sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, acquired of land that would come to hold of exhibition galleries, a research library, a lake, a shoreline trail with fourteen bridges, and over 35,000 maritime artifacts from around the globe. After the land acquisition took place, the first two years were devoted to creating and improving a natural park and constructing a dam to create Lake Maury, named after the nineteenth-century Virginia oceanographer, Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury.\n\nThe museum’s collection totals approximately 32,000 artifacts, equally divided between works of art and three-dimensional objects. The scope of the collection is international and includes miniature ship models, scrimshaw, maritime paintings, decorative arts, carved figureheads, working steam engines, and the world's only known existing Kratz-built steam calliope. The museum holds important collections of paintings and drawings by marine artists James Bard and Antonio Jacobsen. The museum offers educational programs for all ages, a large research library and archives, as well as publications and Internet resources for teachers.\n\nThe largest boat in its collection is the \"Oracle Team USA 17\", the yacht that won the 2013 America's Cup.\n\nThe Mariners' Museum is home to the USS \"Monitor\" Center. In 1973, the wreck of the ironclad USS \"Monitor\", made famous in the Battle of Hampton Roads in 1862, during the American Civil War, was located on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean about 16 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The wreck site was designated as the United States' first national marine sanctuary. \"Monitor\" Sanctuary is the only one of the thirteen national marine sanctuaries created to protect a cultural resource, rather than a natural resource or a mix of natural and cultural resources.\n\nThe Monitor National Marine Sanctuary is now under the supervision of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Many artifacts from \"Monitor\", including her innovative turret, propeller, anchor, engine and some personal effects of the crew, have been brought to the museum. For several years, they were conserved in special tanks to stabilize the metal. The new USS \"Monitor\" Center officially opened on March 9, 2007, and a full-scale replica of the \"Monitor\", the original recovered turret, and many artifacts and related items are now on display. Current efforts are focused on restoring the engine.\n\nThe Mariners' Museum Park is 550 acres of privately maintained, naturally wooded property that offers visitors a quiet and serene place to walk, run, or picnic. Within the Park is the 167-acre Lake Maury, named for the famed 19th-century oceanographer and native Virginian, Matthew Fontaine Maury.\n\nFollowing the shoreline of Lake Maury is the five-mile Noland Trail. Dedicated as a gift from the Noland Family in 1991 and with significant ongoing financial support from the Noland Family, the trail has fourteen bridges, picnic areas, benches, handicap access, and mile markers. Each fall The Mariners' Museum hosts a 10K run on the Noland Trail.\n\nThe Mariners’ Museum Park is open daily to the public. Benches at approximately every half-mile offer places of rest along the trail, and views of Lake Maury can be found around every corner.\n\nThe famous Lions Bridge, a dam that provides a scenic view of the James River, remains a highlight for visitors—a perfect family gathering place to enjoy the Museum Park. The beauty of the dam is enhanced by several fine pieces of statuary designed by Anna Hyatt Huntington, sculptor and wife of Museum founder Archer Milton Huntington. Four stone lions were mounted on the ends of the parapets of the dam in October 1932. Anna also created and dedicated a monument entitled \"Conquering the Wild\" that overlooks the Lions Bridge, the park, and Lake Maury.\n\n\n"}

The plan was, as 2 PARA attacked Wireless Ridge, 4 Rigid Raider fast landing crafts (steered by Sergeant Buckle, Lance-Corporal Gilbert and Marines Kavanagh and Nordic) and carrying SAS soldiers (some 30 men from D Squadron) and SBS reinforcements (6 men from 3 section) would travel across the harbour and attack the oil storage facilities on Cortley Ridge.\n\nThe British commando force was spotted by a National Gendarmerie Special Forces officer aboard the Argentine hospital ship \"Almirante Irízar\" (preparing to collect Major José Ricardo Spadaro's 601 National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron on Navy Point in order to insert them behind British lines on Beagle Ridge), before it could reach the fuel tanks. A massive volume of fire, including 8 Hispano-Suiza 30mm anti-aircraft guns from 101 Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment's B Battery (under Major Jorge Alberto Monge) was concentrated on the SAS/SBS raiders from positions along Cortley Ridge. Nevertheless, most of the raiders landed but heavy fire from Lieutenant Héctor Gazzolo's 3rd Marine Platoon prevented exploitation from the narrow beach, causing the SAS/SBS force to withdraw. According to John Parker's book \"SBS: The Inside Story of The Special Boat Service\" (Hachette, 2013), the four Rigid Raiders were damaged beyond repair and three British Special Forces were wounded in the attack:\n\nThe wisdom of this attack was later questioned in British circles as it was seen by some as a reckless operation with little strategic benefit. However, the shore bombardment and British raid in Stanley Harbour scrapped a major Argentine Special Forces operation and convinced the Argentine High Command into believing that a major landing was taking place that would bring the major buildings in Port Stanley within enemy small-arms fire. The Argentine Army Special Forces in Stanley, that were preparing with the Gendarmerie commandos for a major insertion behind British lines on Beagle Ridge, were instead sent aboard the Coast Guard ship \"Forrest\" to help Major Jorge Monge on Cortley Ridge and Spadaro on nearby Navy Point defend the anti-aircraft guns and round-up any SAS stragglers.\n"}
{"id": "17834167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17834167", "title": "Rani ki vav", "text": "Rani ki vav\n\nRani ki vav is an intricately constructed stepwell situated in the town of Patan in Gujarat, India. It is located on the banks of Saraswati River. Rani ki vav was built as a memorial to an 11th-century king Bhima I. It was added to the list of UNESCO's World Heritage Sites on 22 June 2014. Stepwells are a distinctive form of subterranean water resource and storage systems on the Indian subcontinent, and have been constructed since the third millennium BC. Rani ki vav was built in the complex Maru-Gurjara architectural style with an inverted temple and seven levels of stairs and holds more than 500 principal sculptures.\n\nRani ki Vav bagged the title of “Cleanest Iconic Place” in India at the Indian Sanitation Conference (INDOSAN) 2016 in New Delhi in October 2016. The monument was felicitated at the conference, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nRani ki vav, or Ran-ki vav (Queen’s step well) was constructed during the rule of the Chaulukya dynasty. It is generally assumed that it was built in the memory of Bhima I (r. c. 1022–1064) by his widowed queen Udayamati and probably completed by Udayamati and Karna after his death. A reference to Udayamati building the monument is in \"Prabandha Chintamani\", composed by the Jain monk Merunga Suri in 1304 AD.\n\nThe stepwell was later flooded by the nearby Saraswati River and silted over until the late 1980s. When it was excavated by the Archaeological Survey of India, the carvings were found in pristine condition.\n\nThis magnificent east-facing step well measures approximately 64 m long, 20 m wide & 27 m deep. A stepped corridor compartmented at regular intervals pillared multistory pavilions is a unique feature. It was one of the largest and the most sumptuous structures of its type. It became silted up and much of it is not visible now, except for some rows of sculptured panels in the circular part of the well. Among its ruins one pillar still stands which is an excellent example of this period of design. A part only of the west well is extant from which it appears that the wall had been built of brick and faced with stone. From this wall project vertical brackets in pairs, which supported the different galleries of the well shaft proper. The bracketing is arranged in tiers and is richly carved. The minute and exquisite carving of this vav is one of the finest specimens of its kind. Befitting its name, the \"Rani-Ki-Vav\" is now considered to be the queen among step wells of India.\n\nThere is also a small gate below the last step of the step well, with a 30-kilometre tunnel, currently blocked by stones and mud, which leads to the town of Sidhpur near Patan. It was used as an escape gateway for the king, who built the step well in the times of defeat.\n\nMost of the sculptures are in devotion to Vishnu, in the forms of Dus-Avatars Kalki, Rama, Krishna, Narsinh, Vaman, Varahi and others representing their return to the world. \"Nagkanya\", \"Yogini\" beautiful women – \"Apsara\" showcasing 16 different styles of make-up to look more attractive called \"Solah-shringar\".\n\nAround 50–60 years back there were ayurvedic plants around this area, and the water accumulated in Rani ki vav was considered to be helpful for viral disease, fever etc.\n\nThe vavs of Gujarat are not merely sites for collecting water and socializing, but also hold great spiritual significance. Originally, the vavs of Gujarat were constructed quite simply, but became more intricate over the years, perhaps to make explicit the ancient concept of the sanctity of water with the addition of carved stone deities. Thus visitors enter Rani Ki Vav as if it is an inverted temple, where one steps down various levels to the water.\n\nThe steps begin at ground level, leading you down through the cool air through several pillared pavilions to reach the deep well below. There are more than 800 elaborate sculptures among seven galleries. The central theme is the Dasavataras, or ten incarnations of Vishnu, including Buddha. The avatars are accompanied by sadhus, Brahmins, and apsaras (celestial dancers), painting their lips and adorning themselves. At water level you come to a carving of Sheshashayi-Vishnu, in which Vishnu reclines on the thousand-hooded serpent Shesha, where it is said he rests in the infinity between ages.\n\nOn July 19, 2018 Reserve Bank of India announced that the new 100 note in the Mahatma Gandhi New Series, will feature Rani ki Vav on the rear side of the note which is going to be in Lavender Colour, with dimensions of 66mm×142mm smaller than the previous notes (73mm×157mm).\n\n\n"}

He was one of the leading figures in the nationalist movement active amongst a group of leading intellectuals in the 1930s\n\nDe Laferrère came from one of Argentina's leading patrician families. He was of partial French descent although on his mother's side his ancestors included Encarnación Ezcurra, the wife of Juan Manuel de Rosas.\n\nHe was a strong critic of democracy, denouncing the trust it placed in ignorant masses. He was one of the main developers of the belief within Argentine nationalist thought that liberalism was merely a prelude to communism, arguing that \"democracy hands us over unarmed to these forces of extreme socialism and anarchy\". He wrote widely for \"La Fronda\", a conservative nationalist journal. Like many of the nationalist leaders de Laferrère was an academic and in 1938 he joined the likes of the Irazusta brothers, Carlos Ibarguren, Manuel Gálvez and Ernesto Palacio in establishing the \"Instituto Juan Manuel de Rosas\". The \"Instituto\" soon became a centre for the publication of highly conservative scholarship in which historical revisionism about Argentina's past loomed large.\n\nAlong with Rodolfo Irazusta he established the \"Liga Republicana\" youth movement around 1927, the aim of which was to undermine the government. The group was united by the members hatred of Hipólito Yrigoyen although significant elements within the \"Liga\" were inspired by the fascism of Benito Mussolini as well as the ideas of Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella. De Laferrère was insistent that the \"Liga\" should not become a political party and he clashed with Irazusta over the issue when the latter suggested presenting a list for the 1930 election. De Laferrère and Juan Carulla's idea, that the \"Liga\" should support the Independent Socialists, was endorsed and Irazusta resigned from the movement.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Argentine Civic Legion in 1931 Laferrère began to wane in his support for José Félix Uriburu and eventually withdrew his \"Liga Republicana\" from the movement, citing the \"lumpen\" nature of what was approaching a mass movement, as well as it ties to mainstream conservatism. As a consequence of de Laferrère's split other nationalist intellectuals followed suit.\n\nLike many of his nationalist colleagues de Laferrère had a strong strain of anti-Americanism in his thought and this increased during the Second World War. He argued in 1941 that Argentina should adopt a neutral position and should instead concentrate on strengthening its own army in order to ensure it could defend itself rather than spending on supporting the American war effort. His views influenced Enrique Ruiz Guiñazú, who had been appointed as Foreign Minister. However, despite his own anti-Semitism, de Laferrère was not a supporter of Nazism and rather endorsed an isolationist policy for Argentina. Suspicious of all overseas powers, with the exception of France which he declared his support for in 1939, he argued in early 1941 that \"today our worst enemies are the British and Jews. Tomorrow they could be the Yanks or the Germans\".\n\nHis anti-British sentiment was a common feature of nationalist rhetoric in Argentina, deriving in part from the issue's surrounding the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute as well what the nationalists portrayed as a history of mistreatment at the hands of Britain through a series of loans with very high interest rates after independence, British involvement in the independence of Uruguay and the settling of her borders at the expense of Argentina and a form of commercial imperialism that de Laferrère felt had caused the Argentine Civil Wars.\n\nUnlike some of his fellow nationalists de Laferrère was not an enthusiastic supporter of Juan Perón and he scoffed at what he saw as Perón's cowardice when he was ousted from the Presidency in 1955.\n"}

Samuel's father, William Shepperd Ashe (1814–1862), served in the North Carolina state senate and United States Congressman. The United Confederate Veterans conferred the title of Brigadier General upon Samuel A. Ashe in 1936 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Ashe is also noted for his booklet on the war titled \"A Southern View of the Invasion of the Southern States and War of 1861-65.\"\nBorn in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina, in 1840, Ashe grew up near Wilmington and spent much of his life in Raleigh. He attended the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, where he met future naval historian and lifelong friend Alfred Thayer Mahan. When the war erupted, Ashe enlisted in the Confederate Army and served for its duration, rising to the rank of captain. Among his duty assignments was serving at Fort Caswell, on the eastern end of Oak Island. \n\nAfter the war, Samuel married Hannah Emerson Willard in 1871 and had nine children (one of whom was William Willard Ashe, the noted botanist and associate of the United States Forest Service).

The \"middle chronology\" (reign of Hammurabi 1792–1750 BC) is commonly encountered in literature and early twenty-first century dendrochronology has essentially disproved the short chronology. For much of the period in question, middle chronology dates can be calculated by adding 64 years to the corresponding short chronology date (e.g. 1728 BC in short chronology corresponds to 1792 in middle chronology).\n\nAfter the so-called \"dark age\" between the fall of Babylon and the rise of the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia, absolute dating becomes less uncertain. While exact dates are still not agreed upon, the 64-year middle/short chronology dichotomy no longer applies from the beginning of the Third Babylon Dynasty onward.\n\nEstimation of absolute dates becomes possible for the second half of the 3rd millennium BC.\nFor the first half of the 3rd millennium, only very rough chronological matching of archaeological dates with written records is possible.\n\nThe city-states of Ebla and Mari (in modern Syria) competed for power at this time. Eventually, under Irkab-Damu, Ebla defeated Mari for control of the region just in time to face the rise of Uruk and Akkad. After years of back and forth, Ebla was destroyed by the Akkadian Empire. Pottery seals of the Egyptian pharaoh Pepi I have been found in the wreckage of the city.\n\nLugal-zage-si of Umma rules from Uruk after defeating Lagash, eventually falling to the emerging Akkadian Empire.\n\nSince Akkad (or Agade), the capital of the Akkadian Empire, has not yet been found, available chronological data comes from outlying locations like Ebla, Tell Brak, Nippur, Susa and Tell Leilan. Clearly, the expansion of Akkad came under the rules of Sargon and Naram-sin. The last king of the empire, Shar-kali-sharri managed to mostly hold things together but upon his death, the empire fragmented. Finally, the city of Akkad itself was destroyed by the Guti.\n\nFirst appearing in the area during the reign of Sargon of Akkad, the Guti became a regional power after the decline of the Akkadian Empire following Shar-kali-sharri. The dynasty ends with the defeat of the last king, Tirigan, by Uruk.\n\nOnly a handful of the Guti kings are attested to by inscriptions, aside from the Sumerian king list.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Akkadian Empire after Shar-kali-sharri of Akkad under pressure from the invading Gutians, Lagash gradually regained prominence. As a client state to the Gutian Kings, Lagash was extremely successful, peaking under the rule of Gudea. After the last Gutian king, Tirigan, was defeated, by Utu-hengal, Lagash came under the control of Ur under Ur-Namma. Note that there is some indication that the order of the last two rulers of Lagash should be reversed.\n\nUniting various Sumerian city-states, Utu-hengal frees the\nregion from the Gutians. Note that the Sumerian king list records a preceding 4th Dynasty of Uruk which is as\nyet unattested.\n\nIn an apparently peaceful transition, Ur came to power after the end of the reign of Utu-hengal of Uruk, with the first king, Ur-Namma, solidifying his power with the defeat of Lagash. By the dynasty's end with the destruction of Ur by Elamites and Shimashki, the dynasty included little more than the area around Ur.\n\nThe Old Assyrian / Old Babylonian period (20th to 15th centuries)\n\nAfter Ishbi-Erra of Isin breaks away from the declining Third Dynasty of Ur under Ibbi-Suen, Isin reaches its peak under Ishme-Dagan. Weakened by attacks from the upstart Babylonians, Isin eventually falls to its rival Larsa under Rim-Sin I.\n\nThe chronology of the Kingdom of Larsa is based mainly on the Larsa King List (Larsa Dynastic List), the Larsa Date Lists, and a number of royal inscriptions and commercial records. The Larsa King List was compiled in Babylon during the reign of Hammurabi, conqueror of Larsa. It is suspected that the list elevated the first several Amorite Isinite governors of Larsa to kingship so as to legitimize the rule of the Amorite Babylonians over Larsa. After a period of Babylonian occupation, Larsa briefly breaks free in a revolt ended by the death of the last king, Rim-Sin II.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Ur III Dynasty, the resultant power vacuum was contested by Isin and Larsa, with Babylon and Assyria later joining the fray. In the second half of the reign of Hammurabi, Babylon became the preeminent power, a position it largely maintained until the sack by Mursili I in 1531 BC. Note that there are no contemporary accounts of the sack of Babylon. It is inferred from much later documents.\n\nWhen the names of Sealand Dynasty kings were found on cuneiform records like the Babylonian Kings Lists, Chronicle 20, Chronicle of the Early Kings, and the Synchronistic King List, it was assumed that the dynasty slotted in between the First Dynasty of Babylon and the Kassites. Later discoveries changed this to the assumption that the dynasty ran entirely in parallel to the others. Modern scholarship has made it clear that the Sealand Dynasty did in fact control Babylon and the remnants of its empire for a time after its sack by the Hittites in 1531 BC.\n\nThe absolute chronology of the Hittite Old Kingdom hinges entirely on the date of the sack of Babylon. In 1531 BC, for reasons that are still extremely unclear, Mursili I marched roughly 500 miles from Aleppo to Babylon, sacked it, and then promptly returned home, never to return. Other than that event, all the available chronological synchronisms are local to the region in and near Anatolia.\n\nThe Middle Assyrian period (14th to 12th centuries)\n\n\nThe Kassites first appeared during the reign of Samsu-iluna of the First Babylonian Dynasty and after being defeated by Babylon, moved to control the city-state of Mari. Some undetermined amount of time after the fall of Babylon, the Kassites established a new Babylonian dynasty. The Babylonian king list identifies 36 kings reigning 576 years, however, only about 18 names are legible. A few more were identified by inscriptions. There is some confusion in the middle part of the dynasty because of conflicts between the Synchronistic Chronicle and Chronicle P. The later kings are well attested from \"kudurru\" steles. Relative dating is from sychronisms with Egypt, Assyria and the Hittites. The dynasty ends with the defeat of Enlil-nadin-ahi by Elam.\n\n\nPerhaps because the capital of Mitanni, Washukanni, has not yet been found, there are no available king lists, year lists, or royal inscriptions. Fortunately, a fair amount of diplomatic, Hittite, and Assyrian sources exist to firm up the chronology. Having become powerful under Shaushtatar, Mitanni eventually falls into the traditional trap of dynasties, the contest for succession. Tushratta and Artatama II both claim the kingship and the Hittites and Assyrians take advantage of the situation. After that, Mitanni was no longer a factor in the region.\n\n\nLong a minor player, after the defeat of its neighbor Mitanni by the Hittites, Assyria rises to the ranks of a major power under Ashur-uballit I. The period is marked by conflict with rivals Babylon and the Hittites as well as diplomatic exchanges with Egypt, in the Amarna letters. Note that after the excavation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of various Neo-Assyrian documents, such as the Assyrian king list, scholars assumed that the chronological data for earlier Assyrian periods could be taken as accurate history. That view has changed over the years and the early Assyrian chronology is being re-assessed. Since there is yet no consensus, the traditional order and regnal lengths will be followed.\n\n\nBeginning under his father, Suppiluliuma I brought the Hittites from obscurity into an empire that lasts for almost 150 years. The Hittite New Kingdom reaches its height after the defeat of Mitanni, an event which ironically leads to the rise of Assyria. The dynasty ends with the destruction of Hattusa by parties undetermined but which may have included the Sea People and the Kaskians.\n\n\nA client state of Mitanni and later the Hittites, Ugarit was nonetheless a significant player in the region. While regnal lengths and an absolute chronology for Ugarit are not yet available, the known order of kings and some firm synchronisms make it reasonably placeable in time. The fall of Ugarit has been narrowed down to the range from the reign of Pharaoh Merneptah to the 8th year of Pharaoh Rameses III of Egypt. This is roughly the same time that Hattusa is destroyed.\n\nThe Early Iron Age (12th to 7th centuries BC). While not subject to the long versus short dating issue, chronology in the Ancient Near East is not on a firm footing until the rise of the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian rulers in their respective regions. The dates, regnal lengths, and even the names of a number of rulers from that interim period are still unknown. To make matters worse, the few surviving records, such as the Synchronistic Chronicle, give conflicting data.\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon to Elam, power\nin the region, and control of Babylon, swung to the city-state of Isin. Assyria at this time was extremely weak, except during the reign of the powerful Assyrian ruler Tiglath-Pileser I. Other polities in the area had yet to recover from the Bronze Age collapse.\n\n\nAfter the Middle Assyrian Kingdom there is an uncertain period in Assyrian history. The current cornerstone of chronology for this time is the Assyrian King List which, unfortunately, conflicts with other records such as the Synchronised King List and the Babylonian King List. In any event, the rulers of Assyria in this time were all fairly weak, except for Tiglath-Pileser I. Note too that this chronology is based on assumed synchronisms with Egypt in the previous period.\n\n\nDynasties V to IX of Babylon (post-Kassite):\n\n\nThe Assyrian empire rises to become the dominant power in the ancient Near East for over two centuries. This occurs despite the efforts of various other strong groups that existed in this period, including Babylon, Urartu, Damascus, Elam, and Egypt.\n\n\nDynasties X of Babylon (Assyrian):\n\nBabylon was under the direct control of Neo-Assyrian rulers or their appointed governors for much of this period.\n\n\nFor times after Assurbanipal (died 627 BC), see:\n\nThe Hellenistic period begins with the conquests of Alexander the Great in 330 BC.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a research fellow at the University of Oxford and the coordinator of Project Southeast Asia, a collective of scholars of Southeast Asia at the university. The first Singaporean to swim the English Channel, he represented his country in four swim races at the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\nBorn on 17 December 1979 in Singapore, Thum received his early education at five of the Anglo-Chinese Schools. He went to Harvard College at the age of 16 and graduated in 2000 with a bachelor's degree in East Asian studies. A Rhodes Scholar, he attended Hertford College at the University of Oxford, where he read for a second bachelor's degree in modern history and politics.\n\nIn early 2005, Thum was a teacher at Anglo-Chinese School (International) in Singapore. He later returned to Oxford on a Commonwealth Scholarship, where he completed a DPhil in modern history at Hertford College. From 2006 to 2007, he was also a warden at Frewin Hall, Brasenose College.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Thum was a research fellow at the Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore (NUS). Since 2014, Thum has been a research associate at Oxford's Centre for Global History; a fellow of Green Templeton College; and the coordinator of Project Southeast Asia, an Oxford initiative to expand its range of scholarly expertise on Southeast Asia. In 2015, Thum was elected as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.\n\nIn March 2018, Al Jazeera interviewed Thum for the documentary \"The House That Lee Built\"; Thum stated when he was a research fellow at NUS, he published and gave lectures about his research, which showed that Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew \"had lied about his use of detention without trial from the 1960s onward.\" According to Thum, shortly afterwards a senior staff member at NUS privately informed him that he \"would never be able to work in Singapore as an academic... again\". When asked about this, a NUS spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThum represented Singapore in four swim races at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nDuring his studies at the University of Oxford, Thum captained the university's swimming team and earned two Blues times. In 2002, he retired from the Singaporean national swimming team but continued to represent Oxford in swimming.\n\nOn 6 August 2005, Thum swam solo across the English Channel in 12 hours and 24 minutes, and became the first Singaporean to do so. While preparing for his Channel swim, Thum also set a world record when he swam around the Rock of Gibraltar in 2 hours and 52 minutes.\n\nIn March 2018, in response to a call from the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods for submissions, Thum submitted a paper arguing that any legislation by the Singapore Parliament against online falsehood must also apply to the Singapore government. He cited the government's use of detention without trial between 1963 and 1988 during Operation Coldstore and Operation Spectrum. While the government argued that the detainees were part of a communist plot or Marxist conspiracy to subvert the state, Thum claimed that the government has never produced any evidence to substantiate its claims nor have any detainees been brought to trial on the charges they were detained under. Thum argued that these justifications were false claims made by politicians of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) for the purpose of political gain.\n\nOn 29 March, the last day of the sitting of the Select Committee, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam questioned Thum about a paper he published in 2013 regarding Operation Coldstore and the formation of Malaysia\".\" He said Thum fell short of the standards of an objective historian, saying that he \"ignores evidence which you don't like, you ignore and suppress what is inconvenient and in your writings you present quite an untrue picture\". Thum countered that his paper had been peer-reviewed and that no historian had stepped forward to contradict the central thrust of his work.\n\n\"Channel NewsAsia\" and \"The Straits Times\" reported that Thum admitted that there were parts of the paper which he could have worded better, that some of his statements were misleading, and that he had not read nor bother to quote many of the accounts of some communist leaders as he felt that those accounts were unreliable. These included the first-hand accounts of Chin Peng, the leader of the Malayan Communist Party. However, in a subsequent follow-up submission to the Select Committee, Thum claimed that the reports took his words out of context, arguing that \"the crux of my original submission was not addressed in the discussion\", \"the fundamental arguments... were not raised nor challenged\", and \"at no point did I accept that any part of my article was inaccurate or misleading\". He insisted that his \"overall point\" in his article \"that Operation Coldstore was fundamentally motivated by political, not security, reasons, stands\".\n\nCivil activists groups Community Action Network, Function 8, and \"Maruah\", as well as activists Kirsten Han, Terry Xu, and Thum himself, criticised the open hearings, accusing the Select Committee of failing to adhere to its own terms of reference, and claiming the hearings had not been conducted in an open or consultative manner.\n\nA letter signed by 170 academics was submitted to Chong, criticising the hearing as an attempt to attack and destroy Thum's credibility and discredit his research, with the effect of stifling the freedom of expression and academic freedom in Singapore. A letter from six of Thum's colleagues at the University of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia also expressed concerns about how Thum was treated at the hearing, saying that Thum's research, which Shanmugam had criticised, had \"already met the rigorous standards of examination at Oxford and peer review by fellow historical experts on the region\". The letter also expressed concerns about the \"implications for academic freedom, and for freedom of expression in Singapore\", saying that the hearing \"appears designed to intimidate those who seek to publish the truth\".\n\nIn response, Chong argued that it was Thum who had chosen to make a political point in his written submission to the Select Committee, and that while Thum was entitled to his views, he must expect to be questioned about his claims. He also characterised Thum's submission as a \"political piece\" rather than an \"academic dissertation\".\n\nChong also released a report based upon attached emails between two trustees of Project Southeast Asia that were inadvertently copied to the Select Committee, showing email discussions between Thum and Philip Kreager from the University of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia regarding the drafting and sharing of a letter in support of Thum. Chong accused Thum of having \"engineered\" the open letter in support of himself, as well as getting Kraeger to canvass for support on his behalf. Chong alleged \"a coordinated attempt, with foreign actors involved, to try to influence and subvert our parliamentary processes\". Kreager called Chong's statement \"clearly preposterous\", insisting that the emails were merely to \"exchange views\", and accusing Chong of imagining a \"conspiracy\".\n\nOn 13 April, the Parliament Secretariat wrote to Thum to clarify his academic credentials following his claims to be a \"research fellow in history\" in his submission and holding \"a visiting professorship in anthropology at Oxford University\" during his oral testimony. Following media enquiries, the University of Oxford replied that Thum was a research associate at the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography.\n\nOn 11 April 2018, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) notified Thum and Kirsten Han, an activist and freelance journalist, that their 18 February 2018 application to register a private company \"OSEA Private Limited\" was rejected. ACRA released a press statement which stated that the company was \"clearly political in nature\" and contrary to Singapore's national interests. According to \"The Straits Times\", \"this is the first publicised case of a proposed incorporated entity having its application rejected due to foreign funding for domestic political activities.\"\n\nOSEA was to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Observatory Southeast Asia Limited (OSEA-UK). ACRA noted that, in his application, Thum had stated that OSEA-UK has received a US$75,000 grant from the Foundation Open Societies Institute (FOSI), a charitable foundation closely associated with the Open Society Foundations (OSF), which was founded by George Soros. In their press release, ACRA argued that \"OSF, founded and led by George Soros, was expressly established to pursue a political agenda the world over, and has a history of involvement in the domestic politics of sovereign countries\". ACRA cited how the OSEA application proposed to organise \"Democracy Classroom\" sessions, workshops and events in Singapore.OSEA-UK rejected the accusations as \"unfounded\", insisting that New Naratif was supported by revenue from its members, and denying that FOSI or OSF was involved in its editorial decisions or daily operations.\n\nOn 1 May 2018, Select Committee chairman Charles Chong noted that Thum and Philip Kreager – both trustees of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia – were directors of OSEA-UK on the British government's company registry.\n\nOn 30 August 2018, Thum, Tan Wah Piow and others met Mahathir Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, and asked him to take a lead role in promoting democracy in Southeast Asia. This prompted Seah Kian Peng, a Singaporean Member of Parliament, to post on Facebook that \"it appears quite clear to me that Thum does not wish Singapore well\"; some people also called Thum a \"traitor\" online. Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam commented that to invite \"a foreign politician, to intervene in our domestic politics ... is an absolute no no\". Thum rejects the notion that he is a traitor.\n\nThum, Kirsten Han and Jolovan Wham, who also met Mahathir, sent letters of complaint to Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore, denouncing the conduct of Seah, who is also a member of the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods, for making serious accusations without substantiation. Han responded that Seah's Facebook post \"dog-whistled to online trolls and unleashed abusive online harassment – although he's since called for civility, he has not retracted his claims nor provided evidence, and his allegations continue to provide fodder for personal attacks\". The trio also urged Charles Chong, the chairperson of the Select Committee, to \"take leadership in promoting responsible behaviour and engaging in evidence-based discussion\".\n\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs replied to Thum's letter: \"We can have vigorous debates within Singapore about our own affairs. But you cross a red line when you invite foreign powers or foreign leaders into Singapore politics.\"\n\n\n"}

Named after the record label Trojan Records, these skinheads identify with the subculture's Jamaican rude boy and British working class roots.\n\nBecause of their appreciation of music played by black people, they tend to be non-racist, unlike the white power skinheads. Trojan skinheads usually dress in a typical 1960s skinhead style, which includes items such as: button-down Ben Sherman shirts, Fred Perry polo shirts, braces, fitted suits, cardigans, tank tops, Harrington jackets and Crombie-style overcoats. Hair is generally between a 2 and 4 grade clip-guard (short, but not bald), in contrast to the shorter-haired punk-influenced Oi! skins of the 1980s.\n\nThe phrase \"Spirit of '69\" is used by traditional skinheads to commemorate what they identify as the skinhead subculture's heyday in 1969. The phrase was popularized by a group of Scottish skinheads called the Glasgow Spy Kids. A skinhead history book entitled \"Spirit of 69: A Skinhead Bible\" was written by George Marshall, a skinhead from Glasgow, in the early 1990s. Marshall documents the origins and development of the skinhead subculture, describing elements such as music, dress, and politics in an attempt to refute many popular perceptions about skinheads; the most common being that they are all racists.\n\n\n"}

While a schoolboy he achieved some reputation as a writer of farces and musical extravaganzas, and his dramatic essays were performed at the Dublin theatres in Smock Alley, Crow Street, Capel Street, and Fishamble Street. Most of these pieces were published.\n\nAbout 1786, Oulton left Dublin, still a youth, to try his fortunes in London. John Palmer, the lessee of the Royalty Theatre in Wellclose Square, accepted the offer of his services, and in 1787 he produced Oulton's ‘Hobson's Choice, or Thespis in Distress,’ a satire on contemporary theatrical enterprise. Its boldness annoyed the managers of the patent-houses, who were engaged in a fierce struggle with Palmer. Oulton then induced an acquaintance to offer in her name his next piece, ‘As it should be,’ to George Colman the younger of the Haymarket, where it was produced on 3 June 1789. The piece was published anonymously; but Colman discovered its author, and gave Oulton much encouragement. On 7 July 1792 he produced a short piece by Oulton, ‘All in Good Humour’ (London, 1792); there followed at the same house ‘Irish Tar,’ a musical piece, 24 August 1797; ‘The Sixty-third Letter,’ a musical farce, 28 July 1802; ‘The Sleep-walker, or which is the Lady?’ 15 June 1812; and ‘My Landlady's Gown,’ 10 August 1816. Meanwhile, at Covent Garden, Oulton secured the production of two similar pieces, ‘Perseverance,’ 2 June 1789, and ‘Botheration,’ on 2 May 1798. David Erskine Baker credited him with the choruses in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's ‘Pizarro,’ which was produced in 1799. In 1798 he provided two pantomimes, ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’ and the ‘Two Apprentices,’ for the Birmingham theatre.\n\nHis last connection with the stage was on 27 February 1817, when his farce ‘Frighten'd to Death’ was produced at Drury Lane.\n\nIn 1784, there appeared the ‘Haunted Castle,’ the ‘Happy Disguise,’ and the ‘New Wonder;’ in 1785 the ‘Madhouse,’ ‘New Way to keep a Wife at Home,’ ‘Poor Maria,’ the ‘Recruiting Manager,’ and ‘Curiosity.’ The ‘Haunted Castle’ and the ‘Madhouse’ are said to have held the stage for some years.\n\nOulton was acquainted with the work of August von Kotzebue on which Sheridan's play \"Pizarro\" was based, and produced in 1800 a volume called ‘The Beauties of Kotzebue.’\n\nBetween 2 January and 26 February 1787, he produced a tri-weekly sheet, called \"The Busybody\", on the model of \"The Spectator\"; at the twenty-fifth number it ceased. The whole work was issued in two volumes in 1789. In 1795 he published, under the pseudonym of ‘George Horne, D.D.,’ two tracts attacking the pretensions of Richard Brothers the prophet and of his disciple Nathaniel Brassey Halhed. The first was entitled ‘Sound Argument, dictated by Common-sense’ (Oxford, 1795); the second, ‘Occasional Remarks addressed to N. B. Halhed, Esq.’ (London, 1795).\n\nOulton argued for the authenticity of \"Vortigern\", one of the Ireland Shakespeare forgeries. He issued an anonymous pamphlet, ‘Vortigern under Consideration’ (1796), on Samuel Ireland's behalf.\n\nOn recent theatrical history, he wrote ‘The History of the Theatres of London from 1771 to 1795,’ which appeared in 1796 in two volumes, a continuation of Benjamin Victor's ‘History.’ For James Barker, the theatrical publisher, he prepared in 1802, mainly ‘from the manuscripts of Mr. Henderson,’ ‘Barker's Continuation of Egerton's Theatrical Remembrancer … from 1787 to 1801.’ Finally he produced ‘A History of the Theatres of London from 1795 to 1817,’ London, 3 vols. 1818.\n\nOther publications were: \n\nAfter 1820 Oulton disappears.\n\n"}

Rostow) (October 7, 1916 – February 13, 2003) was an American economist and political theorist who served as Special Assistant for National Security Affairs to US President Lyndon B. Johnson from 1966 to 1969.\n\nProminent for his role in the shaping of US foreign policy in Southeast Asia during the 1960s, he was a staunch anti-communist, noted for a belief in the efficacy of capitalism and free enterprise, strongly supporting US involvement in the Vietnam War. Rostow is known for his book \"The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto\" (1960), which was used in several fields of social science.\n\nHis older brother Eugene Rostow also held a number of high government foreign policy posts.\n\nRostow was born in Manhattan, New York City, to a Russian Jewish immigrant family. His parents, Lillian (Helman) and Victor Rostow, were active socialists, and named Walt after Walt Whitman. His brother Eugene, named for Eugene V. Debs, became a legal scholar, and his brother Ralph, after Ralph Waldo Emerson, a department store manager.\n\nRostow entered Yale University at age 15 on a full scholarship, graduated at 19, and completed his Ph.D. there in 1940. He also won a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Balliol College, Oxford, where he completed a B.Litt. degree. In 1936, during the Edward VIII abdication crisis, he assisted broadcaster Alistair Cooke, who reported on the events for the NBC radio network. After completing his education, he started teaching economics at Columbia University.\n\nDuring World War II, Rostow served in the Office of Strategic Services under William Joseph Donovan. Among other tasks, he participated in selecting targets for US bombardment. Nicholas Katzenbach would later joke: \"I finally understand the difference between Walt and me [...] I was the navigator who was shot down and spent two years in a German prison camp, and Walt was the guy picking my targets.\"\n\nIn 1945, immediately after the war, Rostow became assistant chief of the German-Austrian Economic Division in the United States Department of State in Washington, D.C. In 1946, he returned to Oxford as the Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Professor of American History. In 1947, he became the assistant to the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe, and was involved in the development of the Marshall Plan.\n\nRostow spent a year at Cambridge University as the Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions. He was professor of economic history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1950 to 1961, and a staff member of the Center for International Studies (CIS) at MIT from 1951 to 1961. From late 1951 to August 1952, Rostow headed the Soviet Vulnerabilities Project. The project, which was sponsored by CIS and received significant support from the U.S. government, sought to identify Soviet vulnerabilities to political/psychological warfare, and received contributions from top Sovietologist and psychological warfare specialists. In June 1955, Rostow headed a group of stalwart cold warriors called the \"Quantico Vulnerabilities Panel\" which issued a report advocating nuclear coercion toward the Soviet Union. Although the experts were invited by Nelson Rockefeller, their proposal ran contrary to the policy of the Eisenhower administration.\n\nIn 1954, Rostow advised President Dwight Eisenhower on economic and foreign policy, and in 1958 he became a speechwriter for him. In August 1954, Rostow and fellow CIA-connected MIT economics professor Max F. Millikan convinced Eisenhower to massively increase US foreign aid for development as part of a policy of spreading American-style capitalist economic growth in Asia and elsewhere, backed by the military.\n\nWhile working as national security advisor, Rostow became involved in setting the United States' posture towards Israel. Although he supported military and economic assistance to Israel, Rostow believed that increased public alignment between the two states could run counter to US diplomatic and oil interests in the region. After reviewing the May 1967 report from the Atomic Energy Commission team that had inspected Dimona along with other intelligence, Rostow informed President Johnson that, though the team found no evidence of a nuclear weapons program, \"there are enough unanswered questions to make us want to avoid getting locked in too closely with Israel.\"\n\nConcerns about Israel's nuclear program were tabled by the United States during the build-up to the Six-Day War and its aftermath. Though Rostow, Johnson, and Secretary of State Dean Rusk tried to convince Israel not to resort to military force, they supported Israel once the war began. When the nuclear issue resurfaced in January 1968, just prior to Prime Minister Levi Eshkol's visit to the United States, Rostow recommended that the president make it clear that the United States expected Israel to sign the NPT.\n\nIn 1960, Rostow published \"The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto\", which proposed the Rostovian take-off model of economic growth, one of the major historical models of economic growth, which argues that economic modernization occurs in five basic stages of varying length: traditional society, preconditions for take-off, take-off, drive to maturity, and high mass consumption. This became one of the important concepts in the theory of modernization in social evolutionism. Rostow's thesis was criticized at the time and subsequently as universalizing a model of Western development that could not be replicated in places like Latin America or sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe book impressed presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, who appointed Rostow as one of his political advisers, and sought his advice. When Kennedy became president in 1961, he appointed Rostow as deputy to his national security assistant McGeorge Bundy. Later that year, Rostow became Director of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff. After Kennedy's assassination, his successor Lyndon B. Johnson promoted Rostow to Bundy's job after he wrote Johnson's first State of the Union speech. As national security adviser, Rostow was responsible for developing the government's policy in Vietnam, and was convinced that the war could be won, becoming Johnson's main war hawk and playing an important role in bringing Johnson's presidency to an end.\n\nWhen Richard Nixon became president, Rostow left office, and over the next thirty years taught economics at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin with his wife Elspeth Rostow, who later became dean of the school. He wrote extensively in defense of free enterprise economics, particularly in developing nations.\n\nRostow received the Order of the British Empire (1945), the Legion of Merit (1945), and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1969).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30528678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30528678", "title": "Women in the Israel Defense Forces", "text": "Women in the Israel Defense Forces\n\nThe women in the Israel Defense Forces are female soldiers who serve in the Israel Defense Forces. Israel is one of only a few countries in the world with a mandatory military service requirement for women. \n\nAccording to the IDF, 535 female Israeli soldiers had been killed in combat operations between the period 1962-2016 (this figure does not include the dozens of female soldiers killed in Israeli service prior to 1962). Women have taken part in Israel’s military before and since the founding of the state in 1948, with women comprising over 20% of Israeli forces in 1948, and 33% of all IDF soldiers and 51% of its officers, in 2011, fulfilling various roles within the Ground, Navy and Air Forces. The 2000 Equality amendment to the Military Service law states that \"The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men.\" As of now, 88% to 92% of all roles in the IDF are open to female candidates, while women can be found in 69% of all positions.\n\nUp until 2001 women conscripts served in the Women's Corps, commonly known by its Hebrew acronym, CHEN. After a five-week period of basic training they served as clerks, drivers, welfare workers, nurses, radio operators, flight controllers, ordnance personnel, and course instructors.\n\nBefore the establishment of the state, women served in combat roles in the militias that would become the Israel Defense Forces. The rate of women who took part in combat organizations stood at 20%. At the years before the establishment of the IDF, military service for women existed in the lines of the Hashomer and Haganah organizations. The Haganah stated in its law that its lines were open to: \"Every Jewish male or female, who is prepared and trained to fulfill the obligation of national defense.\" Most served as medics, communications specialists, and weaponeers. During WWII approximately 4,000 females volunteered for service in the British assisting forces. One of them, Alice Hatzor-Hirsch, was about 16 when she joined the Hagana. In 1942, she joined the British army as a driver. \"We were more connected than the others,\" she recalled years later. \"A girl becoming a driver in the British army was considered the height of boldness at the time.\"\n\nIn Tel-Aviv of the 1940s, a battalion was established in which women filled positions in security, weapons transport, and manned anti-aircraft posts. During the winter of 1948, women joined the combat soldiers of the Palmach, who traveled from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with their weapons concealed in their clothes. The Palmach arm (thirty percent of which were females) trained nine female platoon commanders, and other female squad commanders.\n\nOn 26 May 1948, Prime Minister David Ben Gurion officially set up the IDF as the country's army. On 18 August 1948, mandatory conscription for single and married women without children (born between the years 1920-1930) began.\n\nWomen served in many positions including nurses, signal operators, drivers, clerks, cooks and more. The Women's Corps, under which all women served, was responsible for taking care of women soldiers' needs and for their training and integration into different IDF units. The Women's Corps also sent young women soldiers to be teachers in developing areas and immigrant neighborhoods of Israel.\n\nApart from the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when manpower shortages saw many Palmach and IDF women taking active part in land battles, women were historically barred from battle in the IDF, serving in a variety of technical and administrative support roles. Soon after the establishment of the IDF, the removal of all women from front-line positions was decreed. Decisive for this decision was the very real possibility of falling into enemy hands as prisoners of war. It was fair and equitable to demand from women equal sacrifice and risk, it was argued, but the risk for women prisoners of rape and sexual molestation was infinitely greater than the same risk for men. A majority of women serving in the IDF then were secretaries. The rest served primarily as instructors, nurses, clerks and telephone operators. A few women flew transport missions in the 1950s and a few women were accepted into flight training in the 1970s, but did not complete the program before it was closed to women.\n\nYael Rom, the first female pilot trained by the Israeli Air Force, earned her wings in 1951.\nHava Inbar, a lawyer, was appointed the judge of the military court in Haifa in September 1969, thus becoming the first female military judge in the world. \"I do not know if I want to be a military judge my whole life,\" she said in an interview, \"but I am glad that I was appointed; it proves that the IDF leaves almost all doors open for its female soldiers.\"\nDuring the Yom Kippur War, due to a growing need for ground forces, women were needed in roles in the field. According to Rina Bar-Tal, chair of the Israel Women's Network, roles for women beyond technical and secretarial support only started to open up in the late 1970s and early '80s, because of manpower shortages. Since then, a few women have earned ranks higher than colonel. In 1986, Amira Dotan, then head of the Women's Corps, became the first female brigadier-general.\n\nCivilian pilot and aeronautical engineer Alice Miller successfully petitioned the High Court of Justice to take the Israeli Air Force pilot training exams, after being rejected on grounds of gender. Though president Ezer Weizman, a former IAF commander, told Miller that she'd be better off staying home and darning socks, the court eventually ruled in 1996 that the \nIAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller would not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in new IDF roles. Female legislators took advantage of the momentum to draft a bill allowing women to volunteer for any position, if they could qualify.\n\nIn 2000, the Equality amendment to the Military Service law stated that \"The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men.\" The amendment that female lawmakers had drafted granted equal opportunities to women found physically and personally suitable for a job. The question of who and what was \"suitable\" was left to the discretion of military leaders on a case-by-case basis. Women did start to enter combat support and light combat roles in a few areas, including the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armored divisions. A few platoons named Carakal were formed for men and women to serve together in light infantry. By 2000 Carakal became a full-fledged battalion. Many women would also join the Border Police.\n\nThe first female jet fighter pilot, Roni Zuckerman, received her wings in 2001. By 2006, the first female pilots and navigators graduated from the IAF training course, and several hundred women entered combat units, primarily in support roles, like intelligence gatherers, instructors, social workers, medics and engineers. When the Second Lebanon War broke out, it was the first time since 1948 that women were in field operations alongside men. Airborne helicopter engineer Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Keren Tendler was the first female IDF combat soldier to be killed in action.\nIn November 2007 the Air Force appointed its first woman deputy squadron commander.\n\nOn 23 June 2011, Orna Barbivai became the first female Major-General in the IDF upon her promotion to the role of commander of the Manpower Directorate. She is the second woman to serve on the General Staff. In 2012, Capitan Merav Buchris became the first female ammunition Officer in the Air force, she started her military career as a Shoher at the Technical Academy in Haifa. In 2013, in a first, a female IDF soldier was called up to the Torah during a service on a military base. Also in 2013, the IDF announced they would, for the first time, allow a (MTF) transgender woman to serve in the army as a female soldier.\n\nIn 2014, there were several more firsts for women in the IDF. The IDF appointed Major Oshrat Bacher as Israel's first female combat battalion commander; Dr. Shani became the first female combat doctor in an elite counterterror unit in the IDF (specifically, the Duvdevan counterterrorism unit); and the IDF decided to allow female kosher supervisors to work in its kitchens on military bases.\n\nMandatory service for women in the IDF is 24 months, apart from roles specified in law which require a service length of 36 months. Women may be exempted from military service for reasons of religious conscience, marriage, pregnancy, or motherhood. A woman may receive an exemption on religious grounds under the following conditions:\nWomen who arrive in Israel at age 17 and over are generally exempt from army service, but may serve on a voluntary basis. Also, women (who are not fighters) are not generally called up for reserve duty if they are married, or if they are beyond age 24.\n\nClause 16A of the military service law requires that female combat soldiers serve 2 years and 4 months of mandatory service, and continue in reserves service up to age 38. Each year, 1,500 female combat soldiers are drafted into the IDF. Women currently make up 3% of the IDF's combat soldiers. Women were employed in full combat roles during the War of Independence and early years. An incident involving the abuse of a woman's corpse led to their withdrawal from full combat until 2000, when the Caracal Battalion was raised.\n\nIn 2014, the IDF appointed Major Oshrat Bacher as Israel’s first female combat battalion commander.\n\nThe most notable combat option for women is the Caracal Battalion, which is a light infantry force that is made up of 70 percent female soldiers. The unit undergoes combat infantry training. There are two other mixed-sex infantry battalions: the Lions of Jordan Battalion and the Bardelas Battalion. The IDF commando K9 unit, Oketz, also drafts females as combat soldiers. Women are also allowed to join the Combat Intelligence Collection Corps, and to serve as Search and Rescue personnel in the IDF Home Front Command's Search and Rescue Force, officially classified as a combat unit. A pilot program currently being tested has women serving in tanks.\n\nDespite being officially classified as combat soldiers, women in combat roles are not deliberately deployed into combat situations. They are expected to respond in the event a combat situation does erupt, but are not deployed to situations where there is a high risk of combat. The three mixed-sex infantry battalions are deployed to border patrol duties on the Israeli borders with Egypt and Jordan and security duties in the Jordan Valley, and female infantry soldiers are barred from joining the frontline combat infantry brigades which are deployed in the event of war. Female tank crews, who are also only regulated to border guard duties, do not serve in the regular armored combat units.\n\nThe Women's Corps was dismantled in 2000, so that female soldiers for the first time would fall under the authority of individual units based on jobs and not on gender. They would wear the insignia of their units instead of the insignia of the Women's Corps. The position of Women's Affairs Advisor to the Chief of Staff was created in 2001. The female officer holding the position is in charge of ensuring more opportunities and a suitable environment for female soldiers, as well as better enhancing their skills. The mission of the advisor is described by the IDF as \"empowering women, the IDF and Israeli society by promoting conditions that allow for the optimal use of the capabilities of women serving in the IDF; promoting equal opportunities for women during their military service; and assimilating women into military leadership positions.\"\n\nSixty–five percent of Israeli women serve in the army, 25 percent opt out on religious grounds, the remainder are exempted for physical, emotional or marital reasons. A law passed in 1978 made exemptions for women on religious grounds automatic upon the signing of a simple declaration attesting to the observance of orthodox religious practices. This legislation raised considerable controversy, and IDF officials feared that the exemption could be abused by any nonreligious woman who did not wish to serve and thus further exacerbate the already strained personnel resources of the IDF. Women exempted on religious grounds were legally obliged to fulfill a period of alternative service doing social or educational work assigned to them. In practice, however, women performed such service only on a voluntary basis.\n\nIn 2007, then Head of Manpower Directorate, Aluf (Maj. Gen.) Elazar Stern, appointed a committee to define women's service in the IDF in the next decade, with the objective of increasing equal opportunities in women's service in the IDF. The committee, headed by Maj. Gen. (res.) Yehuda Segev, submitted its report to Stern in September 2007.\n\nIn September 2008, the 100-page report was presented to the IDF General Staff. Rav Aluf Gabi Ashkenazi, then-Chief of Staff, voiced support for the committee's vision:The IDF, as a leading organization in Israeli society, designates the service of men and women to a fulfilling and respectful service based upon equal opportunities in the service of [the] IDF and the State of Israel.\nThe committee called for the annulment of the model that has been in place since the 1950s, under which a soldier's length of service and service options is largely determined by gender. \"This is an archaic model that causes under-utilization of the resources ... of half of Israeli society, and closes off many opportunities, both during service and for integrating into society after service,\" the report said.\n\nIn 2007, 12 percent of all army jobs were completely closed to women. The report partially attributed it to the shorter length of service, as a barrier to putting women in the most demanding and important jobs. Hence postings are \"to a large extent\" determined by gender rather than a soldier's talents and abilities. Instead, the length of service \"should depend solely on the job, rather than on one's gender.\"\n\nThe report advised making it harder for women to get an exemption from mandatory service and curbing the phenomenon of women falsely claiming exemptions on religious grounds. It also said the criteria for exemptions from service should be the same for both men and women. The panel recommended mandatory quotas for promoting women, with the goal of giving women a \"significant presence\" in the army's \"senior decision-making ranks.\" In addition, it called for creating an effective, well-funded system to ensure proper working environments for both men and women, and for drafting a \"gender code\" that would lay down explicit rules for interaction between the sexes. \"There should be no jobs or units categorically closed to either women or men,\" it said. \"Service in all units, postings and missions would be joint, subject to the rules of appropriate integration.\"\n\nThe committee proposed opening all jobs to women aside from a handful to be determined by a special committee, whose decisions would require the approval of the Chief of Staff, the Defense Minister and the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. It said the initial screening and assignment process should be unified so that men and women are part of the same system and receive their assignments based on the same criteria, including for acceptance into combat units. The panel proposed implementing this change gradually over the course of a decade.\n\nIn 1950 chief rabbis Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog and Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel issued a ruling forbidding women to join the IDF. In the 1980s Rabbi Meir Kahane ardently opposed women serving in the IDF, advocating national service instead. As of 2014 David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef of the Chief Rabbinate were opposed to religious women serving in the IDF, as was Safed Chief Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu. However, Finance Minister Yair Lapid opposes this position and wants Lau and Yosef to be removed from the Chief Rabbinate because of it. Economy Minister Naftali Bennett stated \"I believe that all girls should do either IDF service or national service. With that, the attack on the rabbis for their traditional position is an unacceptable attack on the respect due them.\" Education Minister Shai Piron said he backs the chief rabbis' injunction against observant women enlisting in the IDF. In 2003 Piron had said, “I don’t know of any rabbis that would allow [observant women] to serve in the army. The halachic authorities saw the reality from a joint education and spiritual perspective, this view led them to their halachic conclusion… The problem with IDF service is the general atmosphere that does not allow for a life without [religious] pitfalls.” MK Elazar Stern said, \"A week ago the Chief Rabbis announced that a female serving in the IDF results in an aveira similar to Chilul Shabbos. This is tantamount to issuing a call to women, at least those who view themselves as religious, not to serve in the IDF...I served in the IDF for a few years and I state the military cannot function without women unless we lengthen the service of males to 4.5 years. The price that we will pay by the call of the Chief Rabbinate Council that females do not enlist is not that of our daughters, but the daughters of these very same rabbis who don't serve.\" Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the Rabbi of the city of Efrat, supports women's enlistment in the IDF. Also, in 2014 the Beit Hillel association of national-religious rabbis issued a ruling in Jewish law stating that women are allowed to serve in the IDF; however, Rabbi Shlomo Aviner claimed that Beit Hillel did not have the authority to make such a ruling.\n\nObservant Jewish women are allowed to do national service instead of enlisting in the IDF.\n\nThe IDF offers Haredim men \"women free and secular free\" recruitment centers. Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon expressed his willingness to relax regulations to meet the demands of ultra-Orthodox rabbis. Regulations regarding gender equality had already been relaxed so that Haredim could be assured that men would not receive physical exams from female medical staff.\n\nIn \"Israel and Its Army: From Cohesion to Confusion\", Stuart A. Cohen has argued that prior to the 1990s, there had existed a general consensus in the IDF that \"sexual prowess goes hand in hand with military accomplishment.\" Even when social attitudes were changing in the 1980s, the IDF was still inclined towards tolerance and a senior army official warned of not blowing the \"topic out of all proportion.\" In 1993, the \"Maariv\" reported that only 10% of around 1,000 reported cases of sexual harassment each year are investigated. Reports of sexual harassment against women in the Israeli army reached an average of one a day in 1999, an increase on the 280 complainants received in 1997. In 1998-99, 54 officers were expelled from the army on such charges, others faced demotion or prison. In one high-profile case, General Yitzchak Mordechai was charged with sexual assault and harassment. Another case involved the promotion of General Nir Galili after being accused of grooming a young female recruit for intimate relations. This issue has led the Israeli military to being described by the feminist American writer Laura Sjoberg as a \"hothouse for exploitive sexual relationships\" and a force whose fighting culture is based on \"rampant licentiousness.\" While the army has since tried to curb sexual harassment, it remains a problem. In 2004, it was reported that 1 in 5 women soldiers suffer sexual harassment.\n\nIn September 2011, because of a religious ban on men hearing women sing, nine religiously-observant cadets in the IDF officer's course walked out of an evening seminar on the legacy of the 2008 Operation Cast Lead in Gaza when a band comprising two male and two female vocalists took the stage to sing. The commander of the school expelled four of them, after they said they would disobey orders again. The IDF agreed to re-examine regulations on this issue, given the growing number of Haredi soldiers in combat units. In October 2011, women soldiers were ordered to leave a post-Simhat Torah celebration on orders from IDF rabbis, and asked to dance in a separate area. In November 2011, nineteen reserve Major Generals sent a protest letter to Defense Minister Ehud Barak and IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz and warned against harming the motivation of women to serve in the army and undermining \"the fundamental values of Israeli society.\" \n\n"}
