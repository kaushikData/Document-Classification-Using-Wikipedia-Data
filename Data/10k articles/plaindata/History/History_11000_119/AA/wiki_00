{"id": "150853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=150853", "title": "Angus Calder", "text": "Angus Calder\n\nAngus Lindsay Ritchie Calder (5 February 1942 – 5 June 2008) was a Scottish academic, writer, historian, educator and literary editor with a background in English literature, politics and cultural studies. He was a man of the Left, and in his highly influential book on the home front in the Second World War he complained bitterly that the postwar reforms of the Labour government, such as universal health care and nationalization of some industries, were an inadequate reward for the wartime sacrifices, and a cynical betrayal of the people's hope for a more just postwar society.\n\nAngus Calder was born on 5 February 1942. His father, Lord Ritchie Calder (1906–1982), was a noted science writer, humanist and pacifist. His siblings are Nigel Calder, mathematician Allan Calder and educationist Isla Calder (1946–2000). His nephew is travel writer and journalist Simon Calder.\n\nCalder read English literature at King's College, Cambridge, and wrote a doctorate at the University of Sussex, on politics in the United Kingdom during World War II. His book, \"The People's War: Britain 1939–1945\", was published in 1969.\n\nCalder became a ubiquitous figure on the Scottish literary scene, writing essays and articles, books on Byron and Eliot, and working as editor of collections of poetry and prose. He also wrote introductions to new publications of such diverse works as \"Great Expectations\", Walter Scott's \"Old Mortality\", T. E. Lawrence's \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\", Evelyn Waugh's \"Sword of Honour\" trilogy and Boswell's \"The Life of Samuel Johnson\".\n\nIn 1981 he published \"Revolutionary Empire\" (1981), a study of three centuries of imperial development by English speakers to the end of the 18th century. \"Revolving Culture: Notes from the Scottish Republic\" is a collection of essays on Scottish topics which expressed itself through the writings of such figures as Burns and Scott and in gestures of realpolitik such as the repression of \"Jacobins\" during the French Revolution. In 1984 Calder helped to set up the Scottish Poetry Library in Edinburgh and served as its first convener. He also worked as an editor of Hugh MacDiarmid's prose.\n\n\"The Myth of The Blitz\" (1991) argued that received ideas of the civilian population's reaction to the bombing of London still reflected wartime propaganda. Calder examined how the German bombings generated ideas and images of plucky and stoical suffering and resistance that defined post-war Britain's sense of itself; but showed that the \"chirpy Cockney\", \"all pull together\" stereotypes were partly propaganda which hid the reality of an inequality of suffering due to deep social divisions, and concealed unheroic stories of opportunistic looting and rape.\n\nA nationalist and socialist, he moved from the Scottish National Party (SNP) to the Scottish Socialist Party, and though he cherished the Scottish republican spirit, he sought to challenge some of the popular myths surrounding the country's sense of national identity. In \"Revolving Culture: Notes from a Scottish republic\" (1992) he described the development, during the early stages of the Union with England, of an \"intellectual republic\" forged by a combination of insularity and lack of English interest in Scottish affairs. In 1997 he edited \"Time to Kill — the Soldier's Experience of War in the West 1939–1945\" with Paul Addison; \"Scotlands of the Mind\" (2002); \"Disasters and Heroes: On War, Memory and Representation\" (2004); and \"Gods, Mongrels and Demons: 101 Brief but Essential Lives\" (2004), a collection of potted biographies of \"creatures who have extended my sense of the potentialities, both comic and tragic, of human nature\". He had always published verse and won a Gregory Award for his poetry in 1967. Questions of Scottish national identity assumed growing importance in the 1980s, and Calder became active in the debate. A distinctive \"Scottish social ethos\" informed the activities of prominent Scots in the years of Empire, when they had invested heavily in the concept of Britishness, although he reportedly felt that the Scots had meddled much more overweeningly with the English sense of identity than the English ever did with the Scots. He was delighted to discover that the game of cricket had been introduced to Sri Lanka by a Scot.\n\nCalder spent much of his career in Edinburgh, where he became a conspicuous figure on the Scottish literary scene as a published poet and commentator on Scottish culture and politics. Calder taught all over the world, lecturing in literature at several African universities and serving from 1981 to 1987 as co-editor of the \"Journal of Commonwealth Literature\".\n\nCalder won the Eric Gregory Award for his poetry and the 1970 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in 1967. In 1971, after the publication of \"The People's War\", the Calders moved to Edinburgh, where he published \"Russia Discovered\", a survey of 19th-century Russian fiction in 1976, and, three years later, became staff tutor in Arts with the Open University.\n\nHis first wife was Jennifer Daiches, daughter of Scottish literary critic David Daiches, with whom Calder collaborated on a book about Sir Walter Scott in 1969. The Calders had two daughters, Rachel and Gowan, and a son, Gideon. His first marriage ended in 1982; he married Kate Kyle in 1986, with whom he had a son, Douglas, born in 1989. He took early retirement from the Open University in 1995.\n\nCalder died from lung cancer on 5 June 2008, aged 66.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the morning gloom, one company commander got lost and his junior officers became despondent. Private Santiago Carrizo of the 3rd Regiment described how a platoon commander ordered them to take up positions in the houses and \"if a Kelper resists, shoot him\", but the entire company did nothing of the kind.\n\nAt 2100 hours on 14 June 1982, the commander of the Argentine garrison in Stanley, General Mario Menéndez, surrendered to the Major General Jeremy Moore. The surrender was in conflict with the Argentine Army code stating that a surrender was illegal unless more than 50% of the men were casualties and 75% of the ammunition was spent.\n\nThe terms of the surrender document were slightly changed after negotiation by General Menéndez. \nThe phrase unconditional surrender was changed for the term surrender. The Argentines were granted:\n\n\nPresent at the signing of the letter of surrender were: \n\nThe letter of surrender read:\nQuantities are approximates:\n\n\nSome of the equipment was rendered useless by Argentine personnel before the surrender.\n\nThe Argentine Rattenbach commission () was assembled after the war to investigate the causes of defeat. It recommended serious penalties for some of the officers in charge, but its influence on the later trial was practically nil.\n\nOn 20 June, the British retook the South Sandwich Islands and declared hostilities to be over after removing Argentina's Southern Thule garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base. Corbeta Uruguay was established in 1976, but the Argentine base was only contested through diplomatic channels by the UK until 1982.\n\nThe war lasted 74 days, with 255 British and 649 Argentine soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen, and three civilian Falklanders killed.\n\nThe British Government decreed that all classified information would be available to the public in the year 2082. However, following the Freedom of Information Act, a great deal of formerly classified material is now available.\n\nThe surrender document is on display at the Imperial War Museum in London. As noted in the museum, the time of surrender was backdated three hours in order that both Zulu time (UTC) and the local time were recorded as 14 June even though technically it was already 15 June in London, in order to prevent possible confusion by Argentine troops who might have mistakenly thought that they were permitted to keep fighting until the next day, 15 June 1982.\n\nRelations between the UK and Argentina were not restored until 1989 and only under the umbrella formula which states that the islands sovereignty dispute will remain aside.\n\n14 June has been a public holiday in the Falkland Islands since 1984, officially called as \"Liberation Day\".\n\n"}
{"id": "23143616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23143616", "title": "ArtPrize", "text": "ArtPrize\n\nArtPrize is an art competition and festival in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Anyone over the age of 18 can display their art, and any space within the three-square-mile ArtPrize district can be a venue. There are typically over 160 venues such as museums, galleries, bars, restaurants, hotels, public parks, bridges, laundromats, auto body shops, and more. \n\nArtPrize lasts for 19 days beginning in late September, and during each festival $500,000 in cash prizes are awarded based on public voting and a jury of art experts. ArtPrize was originally an annual event; in 2018 it was switched to a biennial schedule. \n\nArtPrize was created in 2009 by Rick DeVos, the son of Republican gubernatorial candidate Dick DeVos and United States Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. The DeVos family contributes approximately $560,000 annually to the ArtPrize budget. In 2017, the festival's connection to the DeVos family's wealth and their conservative politics was criticized by artist Eric Millikin in his “Made of Money” installation, placed within ArtPrize. \n\nIn 2014, \"The Art Newspaper\" listed ArtPrize as one of the most-attended \"big ticket\" art events (those where visitors are often counted more than once), with ArtPrize's attendance of 440,000 being roughly one quarter of the 1.6 million who attended the Russian Imperial Costume exhibition at the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. ArtPrize was highlighted along with Slows Bar BQ and the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park as one of the reasons to visit Grand Rapids in \"The New York Times’\" \"52 Places To Go in 2016.\"\n\nArtPrize was conceived by Rick DeVos as an untraditional art contest with its goals being: any artist in the world could compete; anyone with property in downtown Grand Rapids could turn their space into a venue; and any visitor could vote for their favorite artwork. Event organizers would provide no selection committees or curators. And the largest cash prize in the art world would be awarded entirely by popular vote.\n\nAt the inaugural ArtPrize, held in 2009, the winners were determined solely by the public, voting from mobile devices and the ArtPrize website. In 2010, ArtPrize added categories judged by art experts, and in 2014 restructured the awards format bringing two parallel tracks of public vote and juried awards with equal prize amounts. The updated award structure includes two Grand Prizes of $200,000, one chosen by public vote and one selected by a panel of three arts experts. An additional $100,000 in awards are given to artists in four entry categories—Two-Dimensional, Three-Dimensional, Time-Based, and Installation—as well as the Outstanding Venue Juried Award for best curatorial presentation.\n\nVisitors must attend the annual event in person in order to vote. They can either download the ArtPrize mobile app, free for iOS and Android devices, which uses location services to determine when a visitor has stepped into the three square-mile event district—or visit an ArtPrize HUB location to register in person. Each artist is assigned a 5-digit vote code which is posted near their entry during the event, and available both online and in the mobile app.\n\nThe 2009 exhibition occurred in a area of downtown Grand Rapids, from September 21 to October 9, 2009. 1,262 artists or artist collaboratives displayed their work in 159 venues. An estimated 200,000 attendees visited the event, with 334,219 total votes cast throughout the 19 days.\n\nArtPrize 2009 official participation numbers:\n\nThe 2009 prizes, totaling to $449,000, were:\n\nOn October 1, the top 10 entries were announced, and their ranking was announced October 8:\n\nTwo previously unannounced awards were handed out:\n\nThe 2010 event took place from September 22 to October 10. The event introduced \"Exhibition Centers,\" local cultural institutions featuring professional curation. Each ArtPrize Exhibition Center was required to host voter registration/activation as well as a retail presence. ArtPrize sought to have at least one Exhibition Center in each downtown Grand Rapids neighborhood.\n\nArtPrize 2010 official participation numbers:\n\n\nThe 2010 prizes, which were decided by public vote, totaled $449,000, were:\n\nOn September 30, the 2010 Top 10 entries were announced, and their rankings were revealed during the Winners Announcement on October 7:\n\n\nEvent organizers announced the addition of four juried awards for ArtPrize 2010.

The award was decided by a three-member jury panel.\n\n\n\nDavid Dodde’s \"Fleurs et riviere\" was an entry that placed magnetic flowers on the Alexander Calder sculpture \"La Grande Vitesse\". After getting complaints, the City of Grand Rapids contacted the Calder Foundation to get their input. Calder's grandson, Alexander S. C. Rower, replied: \"The initiative is luckily temporary and reflects an utter lack of understanding and respect of Calder's genius.\" The city decided to have the flowers removed before the end of the exhibition.\n\nThe 2014 ArtPrize competition ran from September 24 to October 12.\n\nArtPrize 2014 official participation numbers:\n\n\nThe public vote determined three $20,000 category winners and a $200,000 grand prize winner.

Concerned about the prosperity of Collioure, the kings of Aragon granted privileges and tax exemptions. An annual fair was established, and important works were undertaken in the castle, the port and the town.\nThe Knights Templar built the castle around 1207 and integrated it to the royal castle in 1345.\n\nA second castle was later built by the Kings of Majorca during the 13th and 14th centuries.\nIn the 13th century, the Castle was annexed to the Kingdom of Majorca, which included the domain of Montpellier, the earldoms of the Roussillon and Cerdanya, the Conflent and Vallespir, and the Balearic Islands.\nThe Kings of Majorca were itinerant. They travelled with their court, moving frequently from Maguelonne, near Montpellier, to Perpignan, to Palma de Majorca or to Collioure.\n\nIn the 16th century, after a brief occupation by Louis XI, the Spanish Habsburgs, starting with Charles Quint, again occupied Collioure. He and his son Philip II turned the castle into a modern fortress of the 16th century. It was imperative that the fortifications were adapted in line with the advances in artillery, and so the castle defences and its surroundings were considerably reinforced.\n\nIn the 17th century Collioure was at stake in the wars between the Spanish Habsburgs and the French Bourbons. \nIn 1642, Louis XIII's troops lay siege to Collioure and the Château Royal. Ten thousand men including Turenne, d'Artagnan and the King's musketeers occupied the hills overlooking the town, while the French fleet blocked the port. Deprived of water due to the destruction of their wells, the Spanish were forced to surrender. In 1659, France annexed the Roussillon and Collioure and the castle passed definitively into French hands. Vauban built the bastions, reinforced the structure and upgraded Fort Saint-Elme.\n\nIn 1793, the Spanish again besieged and occupied Collioure, which General Dugommier took back the next year. He captured Fort Saint-Elme on 25 May and forced the Spanish general Eugenio Navarro to surrender the next day.\n\n\nThe castle was turned into a men's prison in March 1939 and became the first disciplinary camp for the Spanish refugees of the Retirada, the exile from the Spanish Civil War. Many others were sent to the camps of Argelès-sur-Mer and Rivesaltes.\nAfter 1941, French detainees were prisoners of the Vichy regime. The prison received men sentenced for indiscipline, attempted escape and incitement to rebellion from the camps of Argelès-sur-Mer, Saint-Cyprien and Le Barcarès. The detainees transited there before being sent to North Africa.\n\nProperty of the General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales since 1951, the castle is one of the major tourist spots in Northern Catalonia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "266956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=266956", "title": "Conflict theories", "text": "Conflict theories\n\nConflict theories are perspectives in sociology and social psychology that emphasize a materialist interpretation of history, dialectical method of analysis, a critical stance toward existing social arrangements, and political program of revolution or, at least, reform. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class conflict, and generally contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a macro-level analysis of society.\n\nKarl Marx is the father of the social conflict theory, which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology. Certain conflict theories set out to highlight the ideological aspects inherent in traditional thought. While many of these perspectives hold parallels, conflict theory \"does not\" refer to a unified school of thought, and should not be confused with, for instance, peace and conflict studies, or any other specific theory of social conflict.\n\nOf the classical founders of social science, conflict theory is most commonly associated with Karl Marx (1818–1883). Based on a dialectical materialist account of history, Marxism posited that capitalism, like previous socioeconomic systems, would inevitably produce internal tensions leading to its own destruction. Marx ushered in radical change, advocating proletarian revolution and freedom from the ruling classes. At the same time, Karl Marx was aware that most of the people living in capitalist societies did not see how the system shaped the entire operation of society. Just as modern individuals see private property (and the right to pass that property on to their children) as natural, many of the members in capitalistic societies see the rich as having earned their wealth through hard work and education, while seeing the poor as lacking in skill and initiative. Marx rejected this type of thinking and termed it \"false consciousness\", explanations of social problems as the shortcomings of individuals rather than the flaws of society. Marx wanted to replace this kind of thinking with something Friedrich Engels termed \"class consciousness\", the workers' recognition of themselves as a class unified in opposition to capitalists and ultimately to the capitalist system itself. In general, Marx wanted the proletarians to rise up against the capitalists and overthrow the capitalist system.\n\nTwo early conflict theorists were the Polish-Austrian sociologist and political theorist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838–1909) and the American sociologist and paleontologist Lester F. Ward (1841–1913). Although Ward and Gumplowicz developed their theories independently they had much in common and approached conflict from a comprehensive anthropological and evolutionary point-of-view as opposed to Marx's rather exclusive focus on economic factors.\n\nGumplowicz, in \"Grundriss der Soziologie\" (\"Outlines of Sociology\", 1884), describes how civilization has been shaped by conflict between cultures and ethnic groups. Gumplowicz theorized that large complex human societies evolved from the war and conquest. The winner of a war would enslave the losers; eventually a complex caste system develops. Horowitz says that Gumplowicz understood conflict in all its forms: \"class conflict, race conflict and ethnic conflict\", and calls him one of the fathers of conflict theory.\n\nWard directly attacked and attempted to systematically refute the elite business class' laissez-faire philosophy as espoused by the hugely popular social philosopher Herbert Spencer. Ward's \"Dynamic Sociology\" (1883) was an extended thesis on how to reduce conflict and competition in society and thus optimize human progress. At the most basic level Ward saw human nature itself to be deeply conflicted between self- and altruism, between emotion and intellect, and between male and female. These conflicts would be then reflected in society and Ward assumed there had been a \"perpetual and vigorous struggle\" among various \"social forces\" that shaped civilization. Ward was more optimistic than Marx and Gumplowicz and believed that it was possible to build on and reform present social structures with the help of sociological analysis.\n\nÉmile Durkheim (1858–1917) saw society as a functioning organism. Functionalism concerns \"the effort to impute, as rigorously as possible, to each feature, custom, or practice, its effect on the functioning of a supposedly stable, cohesive system,\" The chief form of social conflict that Durkheim addressed was crime. Durkheim saw crime as \"a factor in public health, an integral part of all healthy societies.\" The collective conscience defines certain acts as \"criminal.\" Crime thus plays a role in the evolution of morality and law: \"[it] implies not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes.\"\n\nMax Weber's (1864–1920) approach to conflict is contrasted with that of Marx. While Marx focused on the way individual behaviour is conditioned by social structure, Weber emphasized the importance of \"social action,\" i.e., the ability of individuals to affect their social relationships.\n\nC. Wright Mills has been called the founder of \"modern conflict theory\". In Mills's view, social structures are created through conflict between people with differing interests and resources. Individuals and resources, in turn, are influenced by these structures and by the \"unequal distribution of power and resources in the society.\" The power elite of American society, (i.e., the military–industrial complex) had \"emerged from the fusion of the corporate elite, the Pentagon, and the executive branch of government.\" Mills argued that the interests of this elite were opposed to those of the people. He theorized that the policies of the power elite would result in \"increased escalation of conflict, production of weapons of mass destruction, and possibly the annihilation of the human race.\"\n\nGene Sharp (1928-2018) was a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. He is known for his extensive writings on nonviolent struggle, which have influenced numerous anti-government resistance movements around the world. In 1983 he founded the Albert Einstein Institution, a non-profit organization devoted to studies and promotion of the use of nonviolent action in conflicts worldwide. Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state—regardless of its particular structural organization—ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler or rulers. If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power. Sharp has been called both the \"Machiavelli of nonviolence\" and the \"Clausewitz of nonviolent warfare.\" Sharp's scholarship has influenced resistance organizations around the world. Most recently the protest movement that toppled President Mubarak of Egypt drew extensively on his ideas, as well as the youth movement in Tunisia and the earlier ones in the Eastern European colour revolutions that had previously been inspired by Sharp's work.\n\nA recent articulation of conflict theory is found in Canadian sociologist Alan Sears' book \"A Good Book, in Theory: A Guide to Theoretical Thinking\" (2008):\n\n\nAlthough Sears associates the conflict theory approach with Marxism, he argues that it is the foundation for much \"feminist, post-modernist, anti-racist, and lesbian-gay liberationist theories.\"\n\nConflict theory is most commonly associated with Marxism, but as a reaction to functionalism and the positivist method, it may also be associated with a number of other perspectives, including:\n\n\n"}

It is based on the 1941 film, \"Dumbo\". The original attraction opened at Disneyland in October 1955, three months after the park opened. The four other versions of the attraction were opening-day attractions at their respective parks.\n\nOne elephant from the ride is in the collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., donated in 2005, on the occasion of Disneyland's 50th anniversary.\n\nBased on the character from the 1941 animated feature, the 16 ride vehicles each resemble Dumbo, and are mounted on articulated armatures connected to a rotating hub. The passengers ride in the \"Dumbos\" and can maneuver them up and down with a joystick that operates a hydraulic ram. The ride itself rotates counterclockwise at a constant rate.\n\nA figure of Timothy Q. Mouse, currently voiced by Chris Edgerly, rides atop the central hub. Originally at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom, the figure held a training whip and stood on a disco ball. With the exception of Tokyo Disneyland, he currently stands on a hot air balloon and holds the \"magic feather\". Starting in 2012, Magic Kingdom's Timothy currently spins with his magic feather on top of the attraction's marquee.\n\nEach of the parks, with the exception of Disneyland Paris, has an extra Dumbo vehicle located outside of the attraction to be used by guests for better photo opportunities. Tokyo Disneyland's photo spot differs from its three counterparts; the character is shown in his regular outfit from the original film, with a pink saddle blanket and Timothy Mouse in his hat.\n\nAll of the Dumbos, with the exception of the newer Dumbo in Walt Disney World (which was added with the New Fantasyland expansion), spin counterclockwise. The newer Dumbo in Walt Disney World spins clockwise.\n\nThe original design of the attraction had 10 ride vehicles which were intended to represent not the \"one and only\" Dumbo, but the alcohol-induced \"pink elephants\" scene from the film. In fact, the working title of the attraction was \"10 Pink Elephants On Parade\" and the elephants were painted pink on installation. Walt Disney objected, not wishing Disneyland's guests to ride vehicles themed to a hallucination and thereby ordered them painted grey.\n\nThe ride was scheduled to be one of Disneyland's opening-day attractions, but instead opened a month after the park's grand opening, due to the fiberglass prototypes weighing 700 pounds. For the first two years, the hub of the original Dumbo ride lacked the disco ball with the Timothy Mouse figure. Also, the original Dumbos has hinged ears that were supposed to flap, but failed, due to a number of mechanical problems. So, the ears remained stationary until the mid-1960s, when new Dumbos were given casts with no hinges for movement. The attraction was given another slightly \"newer\" modification around 1978.\n\nDuring his 1957 visit to Disneyland, former United States President Harry S. Truman politely declined a ride on Dumbo the Flying Elephant, due to the elephant being a Republican symbol.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the attraction was planned to be expanded and renamed \"Dumbo's Circusland\" and was displayed in \"Disneyland Presents a Preview of Coming Attractions\", but was cancelled.\n\nIn 1983, as part of Fantasyland's major remodeling, the ride was moved to where Skull Rock used to be, allowing Dumbo's original location to be a shortcut to Frontierland. It was completely rebuilt with a kinetic toymaker-like design, although ten elephants were still used and Timothy still held the whip. In a featurette of the ride, as shown on the DVD release of the film's 70th anniversary, the head Disney imagineer, Tony Baxter, even noted that the new ride looked like one of Gepetto's inventions.\n\nIn 1990, the attraction was updated with the 16 rainbow-colored vehicles (and Timothy's magic feather) originally intended for installation at Disneyland Paris, after an incident during which a bracket support broke.\n\nDuring the 1992 Disneyana convention, one of the original ride vehicles sold for US$16,000. Like other remaining 1955 attractions, one of Disneyland's Dumbos was painted gold in honor of the park's 50th anniversary in 2005. During that same time, Timothy's magic feather was replaced by the whip. \n\nThe installation at Disneyland was manufactured by Arrow Development.\n\nAt Disneyland, a \"circa\" 1915 band organ occasionally provides background music for the attraction. This powerful instrument can be heard more than a mile away, so it is rarely played.\n\nIn 2018, the queue of the ride was expanded and is now covered with new shade structures. Also riders are now assigned to specific Dumbo elephants. The queue is now completely wheelchair accessible. \n\nMagic Kingdom's original 1971 version of this attraction was designed differently from its 1955 Disneyland counterpart. On opening day, it soft-opened without not only Timothy and his disco ball, but the elephants' hats also. The hats and disco ball were eventually added after a few months, but the Timothy Mouse figure was not added for about two years.\n\nThe ride was later updated with the 16 vehicles and the new ride mechanism in 1993. However, it does not include a central water feature like its Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland counterparts; the utilidors running directly below the attraction prevented the installation of water pipes necessary for the water features to operate. Also for this version, as well as its Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland counterparts, Timothy's hot air balloon had red and white stripes, rather than rainbow stripes for the Disneyland version. In 1997, the attraction's queue was covered to provide shade and decorated with topiaries.\n\nFor nostalgic visitors, a replica of Magic Kingdom's 1971 version currently exists at Tokyo Disneyland, being the only park to still feature 10 flying elephants and Timothy spinning on a disco ball. It is also the only other park, aside from Disneyland, to have Timothy holding a whip.\n\nMagic Kingdom's Fantasyland underwent a large expansion and renovation that began in 2011. The new Fantasyland was constructed in phases with the first half of the storybook circus open by mid-2012; a section dedicated to \"The Little Mermaid\", a section dedicated to \"Beauty and the Beast\", and the second half of storybook circus were opened by December 6, 2012, some additional attractions opened in 2013, and the final phase was the opening of the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, which soft-opened in mid-May 2014, and officially opened on May 28.\nSome elements of Mickey's Toontown Fair were demolished and others were rethemed to a new Storybook Circus area. An expanded Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride was built in this new location with an interactive queue.\n\nStorybook Circus began soft openings on March 12, 2012, including one of the new Dumbo carousels. The southern end of Storybook Circus had a delayed opening on March 21, 2012. During the soft openings, it was revealed that the new attraction received the water features that have been included with the attraction in many other Disney Parks around the world. However, unlike the other versions, an additional effect occurs at night when the fountain lights change colors, an effect that was picked up from the Disneyland version, but with more colors. The Dumbo vehicles, which are richly detailed and vibrantly colored, now spin clockwise from the original version, which was reconstructed next to the new one, that soft-opened on June 22. The two rides therefore rotate counter to each other. The attraction also features a new soundtrack and artwork panels at the bottom of the carousels that tell the story of Dumbo, like the Prince Charming Regal Carrousel attraction. However, a new central hub was introduced that lacks the hot air balloon with Timothy Mouse and the magic feather. This figure has been moved above the attraction's marquee. A signature feature of this version is an indoor queue themed to the Bigtop from the film. Inside guests receive ticket-themed pagers where they can wait until prompted, and small children can play in the play area themed to Dumbo's fire rescue stunt scene.\n\nUnlike the other Disney parks, this installment of the ride is the only version that is not placed at the park's Fantasyland. Instead, it is placed at the Gardens Of Imagination.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1628921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1628921", "title": "First Sudanese Civil War", "text": "First Sudanese Civil War\n\nThe First Sudanese Civil War (also known as the Anyanya Rebellion or Anyanya I, after the name of the rebels, a term in the Madi language which means 'snake venom') was a conflict from 1955 to 1972 between the northern part of Sudan and the southern Sudan region that demanded representation and more regional autonomy. Half a million people died over the 17 years of war, which may be divided into three stages: initial guerrilla war, Anyanya, and South Sudan Liberation Movement.\n\nHowever, the agreement that ended the First Sudanese Civil War's fighting in 1972 failed to completely dispel the tensions that had originally caused it, leading to a reigniting of the north-south conflict during the Second Sudanese Civil War, which lasted from 1983 to 2005. The period between 1955 and 2005 is thus sometimes considered to be a single conflict with an eleven-year ceasefire that separates two violent phases.\n\nUntil 1946, the British government, in collaboration with the Egyptian government (under a condominium governing arrangement) administered south Sudan and north Sudan as separate regions. At this time, the two areas were merged into a single administrative region as part of British strategy in the Middle East.\n\nThis act was taken without consultation with southern leaders, who feared being subsumed by the political power of the larger north. Southern Sudan is inhabited primarily by Christians and traditional African religions (Nuer Religion, Dinka Religion) and considers itself culturally sub-Saharan, while most of the north is inhabited by Muslims who were culturally Kushitic.\n\nAfter the February 1953 agreement by the United Kingdom and Egypt to grant independence to Sudan, the internal tensions over the nature of the relationship of north to south were heightened. Matters reached a head as the 1 January 1956 independence day approached, as it appeared that northern leaders were backing away from commitments to create a federal government that would give the south substantial autonomy.\n\nOn 18 August 1955, members of the British-administered Sudan Defence Force Equatorial Corps mutinied in Torit, and in the following days in Juba, Yei, and Maridi. The immediate causes of the mutiny were a trial of a southern member of the national assembly and an allegedly false telegram urging northern administrators in the South to oppress Southerners. The mutinies were suppressed, though survivors fled the towns and began an uncoordinated insurgency in rural areas. Poorly armed and ill-organized, they were little threat to the outgoing colonial power or the newly formed Sudanese government. O'Ballance, writing in 1977, says that the 'period from 1955 to 1963 was simply one of guerilla survival, scarcely removed from banditry, and that it was successful due to a score or so of former southern army officers and warrant officers, and a small number of non-commissioned officers.'\n\nHowever, the insurgents gradually developed into a secessionist movement composed of the 1955 mutineers and southern students. These groups formed the \"Anyanya\" guerrilla army. (Anyanya is also known as \"Anyanya 1\" in comparison to Anyanya 2, which began with the 1974 mutiny of the military garrison in Akobo.) Starting from Equatoria, between 1963 and 1969 Anyanya spread throughout the other two southern provinces: Upper Nile and Bahr al Ghazal. However, the separatist movement was crippled by internal ethnic divisions. O'Ballance writes that one of the Sudanese army's four infantry brigades had been stationed in Equatoria Province since 1955, being periodically reinforced as required.\n\nThe government was unable to take advantage of rebel weaknesses because of their own factionalism and instability. The first independent government of Sudan, led by Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari, was quickly replaced by a stalemated coalition of various conservative forces, which was in turn overthrown in the coup d'état of Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Abboud in 1958. Resentment at the military government led to a wave of popular protests that led to the creation of an interim government in October 1964.\n\nThese protests were the first appearance of Islamist Hassan al-Turabi, who was then a student leader. Between 1966 and 1969, a series of Islamist-dominated administrations proved unable to deal with the variety of ethnic, economic and conflict problems afflicting the country. After a second military coup on 25 May 1969, Col. Gaafar Nimeiry became Prime Minister and promptly outlawed political parties.\n\nIn-fighting between Marxist and non-Marxist factions in the ruling military class led to another coup in July 1971 and a short-lived administration by the Sudanese Communist Party before anti-Communist factions put Nimeiry back in control of the country. That same year, German national Rolf Steiner, who had been clandestinely advising the rebels, was captured in Kampala, Uganda and deported to Khartoum, where he was put on trial for his anti-government activities. Originally sentenced to death, he would serve three years in prison before being released following pressure from the West German Government.\n\nThe South was first led by the late leader Aggrey Jaden; he left the movement in 1969 due to internal political disputes. In the same year Gordon Muortat Mayen was elected unanimously as the new leader of the South. Southern Sudan in this time changed their name to the Nile Republic and resumed warfare against Khartoum, however some of the former leader Jaden's troops would not accept a Dinka leader and fought against the Anyanya. In 1971, former army lieutenant Joseph Lagu formed a successful coup d'état against Gordon Muortat with help from Israel, which pledged him their support. He then gathered all the guerilla bands under his Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM). This was the first time in the history of the war that the separatist movement had a unified command structure to fulfill the objectives of secession and the formation of an independent state in South Sudan. It was also the first organization that could claim to speak for, and negotiate on behalf of, the entire south. Mediation between the World Council of Churches (WCC) and the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), both of which spent years building up trust with the two combatants, eventually led to the Addis Ababa Agreement of March 1972 ending the conflict. In exchange for ending their armed uprising, southerners were granted a single southern administrative region with various defined powers. However, this agreement was denounced as a sellout by former leaders Aggrey Jaden and Gordon Muortat Mayen. The agreement's demise was predicted by both, with Muortat going on to form and lead the African National Front, an opposition movement against the Addis Ababa talks and agreement, and also in 1975, the Anyanya Patriotic Front — a new liberation movement with the same aims as SSPG, NPG and the first Anyanya — to liberate the South as a separate country from the North. The civil war was finally restarted, this time under John Garang.\n\nFive hundred thousand people, of whom only one in five was considered an armed combatant, were killed in the seventeen years of war, and hundreds of thousands more were forced to leave their homes. The Addis Ababa Agreement proved to be only temporary respite. Infringements by the north led to increased unrest in the south starting in the mid-1970s, leading to the 1983 army mutiny that sparked the Second Sudanese Civil War, a conflict that lasted for almost 22 years and led to the independence of South Sudan.\n\n"}

{"id": "1280581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1280581", "title": "Hamartia", "text": "Hamartia\n\nThe term hamartia derives from the Greek ἁμαρτία, from ἁμαρτάνειν \"hamartánein\", which means \"to miss the mark\" or \"to err\". It is most often associated with Greek tragedy, although it is also used in Christian theology. \n\n\"Hamartia\" as it pertains to dramatic literature was first used by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\". In tragedy, \"hamartia\" is commonly understood to refer to the protagonist’s error or tragic flaw that leads to a chain of plot actions culminating in a reversal of their good fortune to bad. \n\nWhat qualifies as the error or flaw can include an error resulting from ignorance, an error of judgement, a flaw in character, or a wrongdoing. The spectrum of meanings has invited debate among critics and scholars and different interpretations among dramatists.\n\nHamartia is first described in the subject of literary criticism by Aristotle in his \"Poetics\". The source of \"hamartia\" is at the juncture between character and the character's actions or behaviors as described by Aristotle.\n\nIn his introduction to the S. H. Butcher translation of \"Poetics\", Francis Fergusson describes \"hamartia\" as the inner quality that initiates, as in Dante's words, a \"movement of spirit\" within the protagonist to commit actions which drive the plot towards its tragic end, inspiring in the audience a build of pity and fear that leads to a purgation of those emotions, or catharsis.\n\nJules Brody, however, argues that \"it is the height of irony that the idea of the tragic flaw should have had its origin in the Aristotelian notion of \"hamartia\". Whatever this problematic word may be taken to mean, it has nothing to do with such ideas as fault, vice, guilt, moral deficiency, or the like. \"Hamartia\" is a morally neutral non-normative term, derived from the verb \"hamartano\", meaning 'to miss the mark', 'to fall short of an objective'. And by extension: to reach one destination rather than the intended one; to make a mistake, not in the sense of a moral failure, but in the nonjudgmental sense of taking one thing for another, taking something for its opposite. \"Hamartia\" may betoken an error of discernment due to ignorance, to the lack of an essential piece of information. Finally, \"hamartia\" may be viewed simply as an act which, for whatever reason, ends in failure rather than success.\"\n\nIn a Greek tragedy, for a story to be \"of adequate magnitude\" it involves characters of high rank, prestige, or good fortune. If the protagonist is too worthy of esteem, or too wicked, his/her change of fortune will not evoke the ideal proportion of pity and fear necessary for catharsis. Here Aristotle describes \"hamartia\" as the quality of a tragic hero that generates that optimal balance.\n\n\"Hamartia\" is also used in Christian theology because of its use in the Septuagint and New Testament. The Hebrew (\"chatá\") and its Greek equivalent (\"àµaρtίa\"/\"hamartia\") both mean \"missing the mark\" or \"off the mark\". \n\nThere are four basic usages for \"hamartia\": \n\nAristotle mentions \"hamartia\" in \"Poetics\". He argues that it is a powerful device to have a story begin with a rich and powerful hero, neither exceptionally virtuous nor villainous, who then falls into misfortune by a mistake or error (\"hamartia\"). Discussion among scholars centers mainly on the degree to which hamartia is defined as \"tragic flaw\" or \"tragic error\".\n\nPoetic justice describes an obligation of the dramatic poet, along with philosophers and priests, to see that their work promotes moral behavior. 18th-century French dramatic style honored that obligation with the use of \"hamartia\" as a vice to be punished \"Phèdre\", Racine's adaptation of Euripides' \"Hippolytus\", is an example of French Neoclassical use of \"hamartia\" as a means of punishing vice. Jean Racine says in his Preface to \"Phèdre\", as translated by R.C. Knight:\n\nThe play is a tragic story about a royal family. The main characters' respective vices—rage, lust and envy—lead them to their tragic downfall.\n\nIn her 1963 \"Modern Language Review\" article, \"The Tragic Flaw: Is it a Tragic Error?\", Isabel Hyde traces the twentieth-century history of \"hamartia\" as tragic flaw, which she argues is an incorrect interpretation. Hyde draws upon the language in Butcher's interpretation of \"Poetics\" regarding \"hamartia\" as both error and \"defect in character\". Hyde points out a footnote in which Butcher qualifies his second definition by saying it is not a \"natural\" expression to describe a flaw in behavior. Hyde calls upon another description from A.C. Bradley's \"Shakespearean Tragedy\" of 1904 which she contends is misleading:\n\nHyde goes on to elucidate interpretive pitfalls of treating \"hamartia\" as tragic flaw by tracing the tragic flaw argument through several examples from well-known tragedies including \"Hamlet\" and \"Oedipus the King\". \n\nHyde observes that students often state \"thinking too much\" as Hamlet's tragic flaw upon which his death in the story depends. That idea does not, however, offer explanation for the moments when Hamlet does act impulsively and violently. It also embarks down a trail of logic that suggests he ought to have murdered Claudius right away to avoid tragedy, which Hyde asserts is problematic. \n\nIn \"Oedipus the King,\" she observes that the ideas of Oedipus' hasty behavior at the crossroads or his trust in his intellect as being the qualities upon which the change of fortune relies is incomplete. Instead, to focus on his ignorance of the true identity of his parents as the foundation of his downfall takes into account all of his decisions that lead to the tragic end. Rather than a flaw in character, error, in Oedipus' case based upon lack of information, is the more complete interpretation. \nIn his 1978 \"Classical World\" article \"Hamartia, Atë, and Oedipus\", Leon Golden compares scholarship that examines where to place \"hamartia's\" definition along a spectrum connecting the moral, flaw, and the intellectual, error. His goal is to revisit the role, if any, Atë, or divine intervention, plays in \"hamartia\". The Butcher translation of \"Poetics\" references \"hamartia\" as both a \"single great error\", and \"a single great defect in character\", prompting critics to raise arguments. \n\nMid-twentieth-century scholar Phillip W. Harsh sees \"hamartia\" as tragic flaw, observing that Oedipus assumes some moral ownership of his demise when he reacts excessively with rage and murder to the encounter at the crossroads. Van Braam, on the other hand, notes of Oedipus' \"hamartia\", \"no specific sin attaching to him as an individual, but the universally human one of blindly following the light of one's own intellect.\" He adds that a defining feature of tragedy is that the sufferer must be the agent of his own suffering by no conscious moral failing on his part in order to create a tragic irony. \n\nO. Hey's observations fall into this camp as well. He notes that the term refers to an action that is carried out in good moral faith by the protagonist, but as he has been deprived of key pieces of information, the action brings disastrous results. J.M. Bremer also conducted a thorough study of \"hamartia\" in Greek thought, focusing on its usage in Aristotle and Homer. His findings lead him, like Hyde, to cite \"hamartia\" as an intellectual error rather than a moral failing.\n\nJ.M. Bremer and Dawe both conclude that the will of the gods may factor into Aristotelian \"hamartia\". Golden disagrees. Bremer observes that the Messenger in \"Oedipus Rex\" says, \"He was raging - one of the dark powers pointing the way, ...someone, something leading him on - he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back out of their sockets, crashed through the chamber,\". Bremer cites Sophocles' mention of Oedipus being possessed by \"dark powers\" as evidence of guidance from either divine or daemonic force. \n\nDawe's argument centers around tragic dramatists' four areas from which a protagonist's demise can originate. The first is fate, the second is wrath of an angry god, the third comes from a human enemy, and the last is the protagonist's frailty or error. Dawe contends that the tragic \"dénouement\" can be the result of a divine plan as long as plot action begets plot action in accordance with Aristotle. \n\nGolden cites Van Braam's notion of Oedipus committing a tragic error by trusting his own intellect in spite of Tiresias' warning as the argument for human error over divine manipulation. Golden concludes that \"hamartia\" principally refers to a matter of intellect, although it may include elements of morality. What his study asserts is separate from \"hamartia\", in a view that conflicts with Dawe's and Bremer's, is the concept of divine retribution.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7721553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7721553", "title": "History of slavery in New Jersey", "text": "History of slavery in New Jersey\n\nSlavery in New Jersey began in the early 17th century, when Dutch colonists imported African slaves for labor to develop their colony of New Netherland. After England took control the colony in 1664, its colonists continued the importation of slaves from Africa. They also imported \"seasoned\" slaves from their colonies in the West Indies and enslaved Native Americans from the Carolinas.\n\nMost Dutch and English immigrants entered the colony as indentured servants, who worked for a fixed number of years to repay their passage. As conditions in England improved and the number of indentured laborers declined, New Jersey's colonists imported more Africans for needed labor. To promote increasing the number of laborers and settlers in order to develop the colony, the colonial government awarded settlers headrights of of land for each person transported to the colony. In 1704, after East Jersey and West Jersey unified, the Province of New Jersey passed a slave code prohibiting slaves and free blacks from owning property, further restricting African Americans in the state.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, enslaved African Americans fought on each side. The British Crown promised freedom to slaves who would leave their rebel masters and fight for the British. The number of blacks in Manhattan increased to 10,000, as thousands of slaves escaped to the British for the promise of freedom. The British refused to return former slaves to the Americans and they evacuated many Black Loyalists together with their troops and other Loyalists; they resettled more than 3,000 freedmen in their colony of Nova Scotia. Others were transported to England and the West Indies.\n\nBergen County developed as the largest slaveholding county in the state, in part because many slaves were used as laborers in its ports and cities. After the Revolutionary War, many northern states rapidly passed laws to abolish slavery, but New Jersey did not abolish it until 1804, and then in a process of gradual emancipation similar to that of New York. But, in New Jersey, some slaves were held as late as 1865. (In New York, they were all freed by 1827.) The law made African Americans free at birth, but it required children (born to slave mothers), to serve lengthy apprenticeships as a type of indentured servant until early adulthood for the masters of their slave mothers. New Jersey was the last of the Northern states to abolish slavery completely. The last 16 slaves in New Jersey were freed in 1865 by the Thirteenth Amendment.\n\nThe Underground Railroad had several routes crossing the state, four of which ended in Jersey City, where fugitive slaves could cross the Hudson River. New Brunswick, 'Hub City', was a main location where runaways would travel during the days of the Underground Railroad. During the American Civil War, African Americans served in several all-black Union Army regiments from New Jersey.\n\nIn 2008, the legislature of New Jersey passed a resolution of official apology for slavery, becoming the third state to do so. Rutgers, the State University moved to rectify its past wrongs and connections to slavery during its 250th anniversary celebration in 2016. Princeton University, the oldest college in the state of New Jersey, released the findings of its Princeton & Slavery Project in 2017.\n\nThe Dutch West India Company introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves to New Amsterdam, capital of the nascent province of New Netherland. They worked as farmers, fur traders, and builders. It later expanded across the North River (Hudson River) to Pavonia and Communipaw, eventually becoming Bergen, where slaves worked the company plantation. Settlers to the area later held slaves privately, often using them as domestic servants and laborers. Although enslaved, the Africans had a few basic rights and families were usually kept intact. They were admitted to the Dutch Reformed Church and married by its ministers, who also baptized their children. While enslaved Africans could be admitted to the Church, the church itself did not prohibit their enslavement. In fact, the Church did not even find that enslavement sinful. Slaves could testify in court, sign legal documents, and bring civil actions against whites. Some were permitted to work after hours, when they earned wages equal to those paid to white workers. When the colony fell, the company freed all its slaves, establishing early on a nucleus of free negros.\n\nEnglish traders continued to import African slaves after they took over the colony from the Dutch in 1664 and established a proprietorship. Eager to attract more settlers and laborers to develop the colony, the proprietorship encouraged the importation of slaves for labor by offering settlers headrights, an award of allocations of land based on the number of workers, slaves or indentured servants, imported to the colony. The first African slaves to appear in English records were owned by Colonel Lewis Morris in Shrewsbury. In an early attempt to encourage European settlement, the New Jersey legislature enacted a prohibitive tariff against imported slaves to encourage European indentured servitude. When this act expired in 1721, however, the British Government and New Jersey's royal governor, countered attempts to renew it. The slave trade was a royal monopoly and had become a lucrative enterprise.\n\nThe liberties of the enslaved peoples of New Jersey were formally curtailed under a law passed in 1704, a so-called 'slave code'. This code prohibited the owning of property for not only slaves, but also free African Americans as well. In addition, it made certain actions illegal for African Americans, like staying out past curfew, that were not illegal for European Americans.\n\nCamden was a center for the importation of slaves, its ferry docks on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia acting as auction sites for the plantations in the Delaware Valley, of which Pomona Hall was one.\n\nIn 2016 Rutgers University published a report \"Scarlet and Black\" recording the university's relationship with slavery. In 2017 Princeton University made public the findings of the Princeton & Slavery Project, which is ongoing.\n\nAfrican-American slaves fought on both sides in the War for Independence. The British Crown promised slaves freedom for leaving their rebel masters to join their cause. The number of blacks in New York rose to 10,000 as slaves escaped there from both northern and southern masters after the British occupied the city. The British kept their promise and evacuated thousands of freedmen from New York, resettling 3,500 Black Loyalists in its colony of Nova Scotia and others in the Caribbean islands. Colonel Tye, also known as Titus Cornelius (c. 1753–1780), was a slave of African descent who achieved notability during the war by his leadership and fighting skills, and was one of the most effective guerrilla leaders opposing the American rebel forces in Central Jersey.\n\nFollowing the Revolutionary War in the 1780s, New Jersey initially resisted the urge to free slaves due to a desire to re-build their devastated economy. According to the American historian Giles Wright, by 1790 New Jersey's enslaved population numbered approximately 14,000. They were virtually all of African descent. The 1790 federal census, however, recorded 11,423 slaves, 6.2 percent of the total population of 184,139. In the decades before the Revolution, slaves were numerous near Perth Amboy, a major point of entry, and in the eastern counties. Slaves were generally used for agricultural labor, but they also filled skilled artisan jobs in shipyards and industry in coastal cities.\n\nFollowing the Revolutionary War, New Jersey banned the importation of slaves in 1788, but at the same time forbade free blacks from elsewhere from settling in the state. In the first two decades after the war, many northern states rapidly abolished slavery, and some slaveholders independently manumitted their slaves. Some people of color left the areas where they had been enslaved and moved to more frontier areas. Since slaves were widely used in agriculture, as well as the ports, the New Jersey state legislature was the last in the North to abolish slavery, passing a law in 1804 for its gradual abolition. The 1804 statute and subsequent laws freed children born after the law was passed. African Americans born to slave mothers after July 4, 1804 had to serve lengthy apprenticeships to the owners of their mothers. Women were freed at 21, but men were not emancipated until the age of 25. Slaves who had been born before these laws were passed were considered, after 1846, as indentured servants who were \"apprenticed for life.\"\n\nAlthough at first New Jersey allowed free people of color to vote, the legislature disfranchised them in 1807, an exclusion that lasted until 1875. By 1830 two-thirds of the slaves remaining in the North were held by masters in New Jersey, as New York had freed the last of its slaves in 1827 under gradual abolition. It was not until 1846 that New Jersey abolished slavery, but it qualified it by redefining former slaves as apprentices who were \"apprenticed for life\" to their masters. Slavery did not truly end in the state until it was ended nationally in 1865 after the American Civil War and passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution.\n\nAccording to James Gigantino, during the early nineteenth century in New Jersey, there were more female than male slaves. After the passage of the Act of Gradual Abolition in New Jersey in 1804, a greater number of advertisements in the state for the full-title sale of female slaves of child-bearing age were published. Female slaves and their reproductive capabilities were highly valuable because their children would be born as slaves for a term, even after the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition. However, domestic skills and labor also affected the value and marketability of female slaves. By 1830, African Americans made up 6% of the total population of New Jersey. The city of New Brunswick had a large African American Population at an around 11%. This added one of the reasons why New Brunswick was a favorable location for runaways, but it also made the city into a popular site for slave hunters, who wished to enforce The Fugitive Slave Laws of 1850. In more urban areas of the state, like New Brunswick, NJ, there were a greater number of slave sale advertisements for female slaves prior to and post-passage of the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition. This was because female slaves were more highly favored for domestic work, which was more prominent in urban spaces like New Brunswick. Enslaved women, however, were not confined to this work, and also performed manual labor across the state of New Jersey.\n\nYet the Gradual Abolition Act of 1804 did not guarantee that a slave born after 1804 would gain their freedom. Slaveholders would regularly sell those slaves down south to states like Louisiana before the slaves reached manumission age, so they could make money off of them. By the 1830s, slavery was on the decline in New Jersey.\n\nCommunities of free negros and freedmen formed at Dunkerhook in Paramus and at the New York state line at Skunk Hollow, also called The Mountain. A founding African-American settler bought land there in 1806, and later bought more. Other families joined him, and the community continued into the twentieth century. According to the historian David S. Cohen in \"The Ramapo Mountain People\" (1974), free people of color migrated from Manhattan into other parts of the frontier of northeastern New Jersey, where some intermarried and became ancestors of the Ramapo Mountain Indians. (Cohen's findings have been disputed by some scholars, including Albert J. Catalano.)\n\nAccoriding to James J Gigantino, at the University of Arkansas, the efforts of New Jersey to legally abolish slavery during the years prior to the Civil War took a long period of time to officially abolish the practice, claiming that one in ten slaves remained that way for life. Many slaveholders sold their slaves to Southern slaveholders, and displayed an apathy for abolition. He stated that about one quarter of New Jersey's African American population was forced into labor during the 1830s. Improper information regarding who was free led to it appearing as though slavery decreased more rapidly than it actually did.\n\nA total of 2,909 United States Colored Troops from New Jersey served in the Union Army. Because of the state's long-term apprenticeship requirements, at the close of the American Civil War, some African Americans in New Jersey remained in bondage. It was not until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed in 1865 that the last 16 slaves in the state were freed.\n\nIn the 1860 census, free colored persons in New Jersey numbered 25,318, about 4% of the state's population of 672,035. By 1870 the number had increased to 30,658, but they constituted a smaller percentage of the total population because of the high rate of European immigration. Overall, New Jersey's population had increased to 906,096, with nearly 200,000 European immigrants.\n\nNew Jersey was slow to abolish slavery and reluctant to pass the 13th Amendment, which it did in January 1866. Some of its industries, such as shoes and clothing, had strong markets in the South supplying planters for their slaves, which was probably a factor.\n\nOn March 31, 1870 Thomas Mundy Peterson (1824–1904) became the first African American to vote in an election under the just-enacted provisions of the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nIn 1875, \"Jack\" Jackson, who was described as the last slave in New Jersey, died at the age of 87 on the Smith family farm at Secaucus. In 1820, Abel Smith had manumitted his slaves, but Jackson refused freedom and remained on the family estate until his death. By the will of the late Abel Smith, Jackson was interred in the family burial ground.\n\nIn 2008, the New Jersey Legislature acknowledged the state's role in the history of slavery in the United States.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16339514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16339514", "title": "Insurgency in Aceh", "text": "Insurgency in Aceh\n\nThe insurgency in Aceh was a conflict fought by the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) between 1976 and 2005, with the goal of making the province of Aceh independent from Indonesia. The Indonesian state had designated it as the \"Aceh Disturbance\" (or \"Pemberontakan Aceh\"). Effects of strong military offensive in 2003 and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake brought a peace deal and an end to the insurgency.\n\nThere is something of a cultural and religious difference between Aceh and much of the rest of Indonesia. A more conservative form of Islam than is mainstream in most of Indonesia is widely practised in Aceh. The broadly secular policies of Suharto's New Order regime (1965–1998) were especially unpopular in Aceh where many resented the central government's policy of promoting a unified 'Indonesian culture'. Further, not surprisingly given the location of the province at the northern end of Indonesia, there is a widespread feeling in the province that leaders in distant Jakarta do not understand Aceh's problems and have little sympathy for local needs and customs in Aceh.\n\nThe centralist tendencies of the government of Suharto, along with other grievances, led Hasan di Tiro to form the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) on 4 December 1976 and declare Acehnese independence. The main perceived threats were to Acehnese religion and culture from the \"neo-colonial\" government and the rising numbers of Javanese migrants into Aceh. The perceived unfair distribution of income from Aceh's substantial natural resources was another point of contention. GAM's first operation in 1977 was carried out against Mobil Oil Indonesia which was the shareholder of PT Arun, the company which operated the Arun gas field.\n\nAt this stage, the numbers mobilised by GAM were extremely limited. While there had been considerable Acehnese disaffection and possibly sympathy for GAM's cause, this did not translate into mass active participation. By di Tiro's own account, only 70 men joined him and they came mostly from the district of Pidie and especially from di Tiro's own village—with some of them joining due to personal loyalties to the di Tiro family while others due to disillusionment with the central government. Many of GAM's leaders were young and highly educated professionals who were members of the upper and middle classes of Acehnese society. GAM's first cabinet, set up by di Tiro during his time in Aceh between 1976 and 1979, composed of the following Darul Islam rebellion.:\n\nThe mid-level and rank-and-file had fought in the 1953–59 Darul Islam rebellion. Many of them were older men who remained loyal to former Aceh military governor and leader of the Darul Islam rebellion in Aceh Daud Beureueh. The most prominent person of this group was Teungku Ilyas Leube, a well-known cleric who had been a leader of the Darul Islam rebellion. Some of the Darul Islam men were possibility linked to di Tiro through family or regional ties but they owed their loyalty primarily to Beureueh. These men provided the military know-how, local knowledge and logistical skills which the young educated leaders lacked.\n\nBy the end of 1979, Indonesian suppression actions had all but crushed GAM—its leaders were either in exile, imprisoned, or killed; its followers were dispersed and pushed underground. Leaders such as di Tiro, Zaini Abdullah (GAM minister of health), Malik Mahmud (GAM minister of state), and Dr. Husaini M. Hasan (GAM minister of education) had fled overseas and the original GAM cabinet ceased to function.\n\nIn 1985, di Tiro secured Libyan support for GAM—taking advantage of Muammar Gaddafi's policy of supporting nationalist rebellions through his Mathaba Against Imperialism, Racism, Zionism and Fascism. It was not clear if Libya had subsequently funded GAM but what it definitely provided was a sanctuary in which GAM recruits could receive much-needed military training. Accounts differ on the number of fighters trained by Libya during the period of 1986 to 1989 or 1990. GAM recruiters claimed that there were around 1,000 to 2,000 while press reports drawing from Indonesian military's report claimed that they numbered 600 to 800. Among the GAM leaders who joined during this phase were Sofyan Dawood (who would become GAM commander Pasè, North Aceh) and Ishak Daud (who became the spokesman for GAM Peureulak, East Aceh).\n\nIncidents in the second phase began in 1989 after the return of the trainees from Libya. Operations by GAM included weapons raiding, attacks against police and military posts, arsons and targeted assassinations of police and military personnel, government informants and other individuals.\n\nAlthough it failed to gain widespread support, the group's actions led the Indonesian government to institute repressive measures. The period between 1989 and 1998 became known as the \"Military Operation Area\" or \"Daerah Operasi Militer\" (DOM) era as the Indonesian military stepped up its counter-insurgency measures. This measure, although tactically successful in destroying GAM as a guerilla force, alienated the local Acehnese which helped GAM re-establish itself when Indonesian military was almost totally withdrawn from Aceh by order of president Habibie in late-1998. Important GAM commanders were either killed (Pase district commander Yusuf Ali and senior GAM commander Keuchik Umar), captured (Ligadinsyah Ibrahim) or fled (Robert, Arjuna and Daud Kandang).\n\nIn 1999, chaos in Java and an ineffective central government due to the fall of Suharto gave an advantage to Free Aceh Movement and resulted in the second phase of the rebellion, this time with large support from the Acehnese people. In 1999 a troop withdrawal was announced, but the deteriorating security situation led to re-introduction of more soldiers and troop numbers were believed to have risen during President Megawati Sukarnoputri's term in office (2001–2004) to around 15,000 by mid-2002. GAM was able to control 70 percent of the countryside in all of Aceh.\n\nThe year 1999 also saw the start of the first ever dialogue process between the Indonesian Government and GAM. This process was initiated by the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD) a private diplomacy organization that facilitated peace talks between the two sides until 2003.\n\nDuring this phase, there were two periods of brief cessation of hostilities brokered by HD: the \"Humanitarian Pause\" in 2000 and the \"Cessation of Hostilities Agreement\" (COHA). The COHA was signed in December 2002. The implementation of both the Humanitarian Pause and the COHA resulted in a reduction of armed clashes and violence in Aceh. The COHA ended in May 2003 when the Indonesian government declared a “military emergency” in Aceh and announced that it wanted to destroy GAM once and for all.\n\nIn a break from its emphasis on military means of attaining independence, GAM shifted its position to one supporting the holding of a referendum. During 8 November 1999 pro-referendum demonstrations in Banda Aceh, GAM gave support by providing transport to protesters from rural areas to the provincial capital. On 21 July 2002, GAM also issued the Stavanger Declaration following a meeting of the Worldwide Achehnese Representatives Meeting in Stavanger, Norway. In the declaration, it declared that the \"State of Acheh practices the system of democracy.\" Aspinall saw that these democratic and human rights impulses within GAM as an effect of the efforts of urban-based Acehnese group which were promoting such values in the freer and more open environment following the fall of Soeharto from power.\n\nSecurity crackdowns in 2001 and 2002 resulted in several thousand civilian deaths. Throughout the conflict an estimated 15,000 people have been killed. The government launched an offensive and a state of emergency was proclaimed in the Province. During this period, the GAM was severely disabled with its commander Abdullah Syafei killed in a government ambush in January 2002, while various regional commanders such as Tengku Jamaica and Ishak Daud were also killed. By GAM's own admission, it lost 50% of its strength during the government offensive of 2003–2005. The insurgency was still going on when the Tsunami Disaster of 2004 struck the province. In November 2003 the martial law was extended for a further six months. According to a Human Rights Watch report, the Indonesian military committed widespread human rights abuses during the invasion and occupation, with more than 100,000 people being displaced in the first seven months of martial law and extrajudicial killings being common.\n\nAfter the devastating tsunami in December 2004, GAM declared a unilateral cease-fire, with members of the international community reiterating the need to resolve the conflict. Of the numerous accounts of the negotiation process, one from the Indonesian side is in the book by the Indonesian key negotiator, Hamid Awaludin. A differing account was written by GAM adviser, Damien Kingsbury: \"'Peace in Aceh: A Personal Account of the Aceh Peace Process\" Despite GAM's unilateral ceasefire, the TNI continued its assault on GAM personnel and positions. Because of the separatist movement in the area, the Indonesian government had access restrictions in place on the press and aid workers. After the tsunami, however, the Indonesian government opened the region up to international relief efforts.\n\nThe tsunami drew international attention to the conflict. Earlier peace efforts had failed, but for a number of reasons, including the tsunami, the inability of either side to militarily win the conflict and, notably, a desire by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to secure peace in Indonesia, a peace agreement was reached in 2005 after 29 years of war. Post-Suharto Indonesia and the liberal-democratic reform period, as well as changes in the Indonesian military, helped create an environment more favourable to peace talks. The roles of newly elected President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Vice-President Jusuf Kalla were highly significant. At the same time, the GAM leadership was reconsidering options available to it, and the Indonesian military had put the rebel movement under significant pressure that encouraged GAM to accept an outcome short of full independence. The peace talks were facilitated by the Crisis Management Initiative and led by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari. The resulting peace agreement was signed on 15 August 2005. Under the agreement, Aceh would receive special autonomy under the Republic of Indonesia, and non-organic (i.e. non-Aceh native) government troops would be withdrawn from the province (leaving only 25,000 soldiers) in exchange for GAM's disarmament. As part of the agreement, the European Union dispatched 300 monitors. Their mission expired on 15 December 2006, following local elections.\n\nAceh has been granted broader autonomy through Aceh Government Legislation covering special rights agreed upon in 2002 as well as the right of the Acehnese to establish local political parties to represent their interests. However, Human rights advocates highlighted that previous human rights violations in the province would need to be addressed.\n\nDuring elections for the provincial governor held in December 2006, the former GAM and national parties participated. The election was won by Irwandi Yusuf, whose base of support consists largely of ex-GAM members.\n\nThe area first fell Dutch authority as a result of the Dutch expedition on the west coast of Sumatra of 1831.\n\nAustralian National University (ANU) academic Edward Aspinall argued that the historical experience of Aceh during the Indonesian National Revolution led to a “path-dependent” development for Acehnese separatism – i.e. past events lead to a narrowing of the possibilities for subsequent development. He argued:\n\nAspinall argued further that there were two milestones for the “path-dependent” development of Aceh separatism:\n\nThe above argument by Aspinall contradicted the views of earlier scholars. Earlier in 1998, Geoffrey Robinson argued that the 1962 defeat and surrender of the Daud Beureueh-led rebellion was followed by roughly 15 years in which Aceh presented no particular security or political problem to the central government. Tim Kell also pointed out that the former leaders of the 1953–62 rebellion had keenly joined the Indonesian armed forces in the crackdown against the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI) in 1965 and 1966.\n\nAceh like most of Indonesia, had Muslims as the majority religious group. However, it is generally acknowledged that it was the region where Islam first entered into the Malay archipelago. The first known Islamic kingdom was Pasai (near present-day Lhokseumawe in northern Aceh) which dates back to the mid-13th century. The earliest found archaeological evidence to support this view was the tomb stone of Sultan Malik ul Salih who died in 1297. In the centuries that followed, Pasai became known as a centre for Islamic learning and a model for Islamic governance in which other Islamic kingdoms look to for guidance. Part of the distinct Acehnese identity would stem from its status as the earliest Islamic region and the exemplar for the rest of the Malay archipelago.\n\nThis separateness from the rest of Indonesia where Islam is concerned could be observed from the formation of the \"Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh\" (PUSA) in 1939 by modernist Islamic scholars (or \"ulama\"). The organisation was exclusively Acehnese. It was noted that in Aceh itself, most pan-Indonesian mass organisations had been weak—even the Muhammadiyah, the main organisation for modernist-oriented Muslims in Indonesia failed to make inroads in Aceh beyond urban areas and was largely non-Acehnese in its membership. However, it was also noted that though PUSA was parochial in its orientation, it nonetheless still identified with a pan-Islamic cause where the goal was for all Muslims to be united under the \"syariah\".\n\nAnother factor of the religious cause for Aceh's separatism was the treatment of Muslim groups and political parties in Aceh by President Soeharto's \"Orde Baru\" regime. First, there was the forced fusion of all political parties representing Muslim interests into the \"Partai Persatuan Pembangunan\" (PPP) or United Development Party in 1973. Members and followers of Islamic political parties in Aceh suffered from varying degrees of harassment. Despite Aceh's special territory status, it was not allowed to implement \"syariah\" nor to integrate Islamic religious schools (\"madrasah\") with mainstream national schools for a unified education system—both proposals were ignored by the central government.\n\nDespite Indonesia being a Muslim majority state, building on Aceh's existing self-conception of its role in Islam and the \"Orde Baru\"'s hostile attitude towards Islamic forms of societal influence, GAM was able to frame the struggle against the Indonesian government as a \"prang sabi\" (holy war) in much the same way the term was used in the Infidel War (or Aceh War) against the Dutch from 1873 to 1913. An indication of this was the use of the words of \"\" (Tales of Holy War), a collection of tales used to inspire resistance against the Dutch, by some elements of GAM as propaganda against the Indonesian government. Before the second wave of insurrections by GAM in the late-1980s, it was observed that some individuals had forced Acehnese school children to sing the \"Hikayat Prang Sabi\" instead of Indonesia's national anthem, \"Indonesia Raya\". GAM political publicity material also painted the official state ideology of \"Pancasila\" as a \"polytheistic teaching\".\n\nNotwithstanding the above, it was observed that in the aftermath of the fall of Soeharto in 1998, religion as a factor for Aceh separatism began to subside even if there had been a proliferation of Muslim student unions and other groups in Aceh. It was noted that these newly-emerged groups rarely called for the implementation of \"syariah\" in Aceh. Instead, they emphasised the need for a referendum on Aceh's independence and highlighted the human rights abuses and misconduct of the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI). Similarly, GAM's position on \"syariah\" also shifted. When the central government passed the Law No. 44/1999 on Aceh Autonomy which included provisions for the implementation of \"syariah\", GAM condemned the move as irrelevant and a possible attempt to deceive Acehnese and or portray them to the outside world as religious fanatics. Despite the official stance on \"syariah\", GAM's position was not a clear cut one. It was noted by the International Crisis Group (ICG) that between 1999 and 2001, there were periodic instances of some GAM local military commanders enforcing \"syariah\" in communities where they had influence in. Aspinall also observed that overall, the evolution of GAM's position vis-a-via \"syariah\" and Islam was dependent on the international environment and which countries it targeted for support in its cause for independence – i.e. if western countries were deemed important, Islam was de-emphasised and if Muslim countries were deemed important, Islam would be emphasised.\n\nThe main issue pertaining to economic grievances were related to the revenues derived from the oil and gas industries in Aceh. Robinson argued that the \"Orde Baru\"'s management and exploitation of Aceh's resources and the way it distributed the benefits was the root cause of the insurgency. From the 1970s to the mid-1980s, Aceh had undergone a \"LNG boom\" following the discovery natural gas on the northeast coast of Aceh. Over the same period, Aceh became a major source of revenue for the central government and in the 1980s, it contributed significantly to Indonesia's exports when it became the third largest source of exports after the provinces of East Kalimantan and Riau. Despite this, practically all oil and gas revenues from production and exports activities in Aceh was appropriated by the central government either directly or through production sharing agreements with state oil company Pertamina. Furthermore, the central government did not re-invest a fair amount of the revenues back into the province. This led some of Aceh's then-emerging technocratic class to lament that the province had been denied its fair share of the economic pie and that it had been marginalised as an ignored peripheral region.\n\nRobinson noted that though some of Aceh's small but burgeoning business class had benefited from the influx of foreign capital during the LNG boom, there were many who felt aggrieved at losing out to others with good political connections to the central government—most notably, the leader of GAM himself, Hasan di Tiro was one such aggrieved party when he made a bid for an oil pipeline contract for Mobile Oil Indonesia in 1974 but lost out to a US company. He further noted that the timing of GAM's declaration of independence in December 1976 and its first military action in 1977 happened at roughly the same time that Aceh's first natural gas extraction and processing facility had opened. Indeed, in GAM's declaration of independence, the following claim was made:\n\nDespite the above, Robinson noted that while this factor partly explained the emergence of the insurgency in the mid-1970s, they do not appear to explain the re-emergence of GAM in 1989 and the never-before seen levels of violence thereafter. Aspinall supports this viewpoint and argued that though resource and economic grievances should not be discounted, they were not decisive as the provinces of Riau and East Kalimantan both faced similar or even harsher exploitation by the central government but no separatist rebellions took place in those two provinces due to the difference in political conditions. He furthered that the resource-based grievance was a means for GAM to convince Acehnese that they should abandon hopes of special treatment and autonomy within Indonesia and instead work for the restoration of Aceh's glory by seeking independence.\n\nGAM's founder Hasan di Tiro and his fellow leaders in exile in Sweden were instrumental in providing a coherent message on both the necessity and right of self-determination for Aceh. Accordingly, arguments on the need for independence was targeted at the domestic Acehnese audience while the right to independence was targeted at the international audience to win diplomatic support.\n\nIn such propaganda, the defunct Aceh Sultanate was cast as a \"bona fide\" sovereign actor on the international stage with emphasis on the sultanate's past relations with European states – diplomatic missions, treaties as well as statements of recognition of Aceh's sovereignty. In accordance to this logic, an independent Aceh (as represented by GAM) would be the successor state to the Aceh Sultanate before defeat by the Dutch following the Aceh War (1873–1913). The Aceh War was thus seen as an unlawful act of aggression by the Dutch and the subsequent incorporation of Aceh into Indonesia in 1949 was cast as an extension of the unlawful occupation by the Dutch. This argument targeted at both the Acehnese themselves as well as the international community—i.e. through its appeal to international law.\n\nIn the same vein, the state of Indonesia was cast by GAM propaganda as a cover for Javanese domination. In di Tiro's own description:\n\nThe efforts at spreading GAM propaganda relied much on word of mouth. Elizabeth Drexler had observed that ordinary Acehnese and GAM supporters often repeat the same claims made in GAM's propaganda which they had come into contact with through this mode of dissemination. The late M. Isa Sulaiman wrote that when di Tiro first started his secessionist activities between 1974 and 1976, he had relied on a network of relatives and a number of like-minded young intellectuals to spread his message—which gained traction especially in Medan, North Sumatra. Aspinall also wrote of GAM sympathizers' recollection of the early days of the insurrection in which they would pass pamphlets to friends or slide them anonymously under the doors of their colleagues' offices.\n\nThe results of the propaganda efforts were however quite mixed. Eric Morris when interviewing GAM supporters for his 1983 thesis noted that, rather than independence, they were more interested in either an Indonesian Islamic state or for Aceh to be treated more fairly by the central government. Aspinall also noted that for some, GAM did not clearly differentiate itself from Darul Islam or the United Development Party which was campaigning on an Islamic platform for the Indonesian legislative election in 1977. For individuals who had become core supporters however, the message of independence found in GAM's propaganda was seen as revelatory and many saw felt a moment of awakening.\n\nMany of the participants of GAM were either participants of the Darul Islam rebellion or were the sons of those who had. Aspinall noted that the kinship ties, between father and son as well as amongst brothers, had been crucial to GAM's solidarity as an organisation. Many felt that they were continuing the aspirations of either their fathers, uncles, brothers or male cousins who were usually the ones who inducted them into the organisation—or whose exploits or deaths at the hands of the state security apparatus had inspired them to join. GAM's constituents were also often residents in close-knit rural communities where everybody knew their neighbours well. These features enabled both continuity as well as a high-degree of resistance to infiltration by the state intelligence apparatus.\n\nAspinall also credited GAM's resilience on the cell-like structure at the lower levels. At the levels below the regional military commander (\"panglima wilayah\") were units commanded by junior commanders (\"panglima muda\") and even lower level commanders (\"panglima sagoe\" and \"ulee sagoe\") who did not know the identities of their counterparts in neighbouring regions and only knew those directly above them. These allowed GAM to survive as an organisation despite the suppression efforts of the Indonesian state.\n\nRobinson argued that the institutionalised use of terror by the Indonesian military in counter-insurgency action against GAM under the late-\"Orde Baru\" period from the middle of 1990 (i.e. in the second phase of the insurrection) had led to a wider section of Acehnese being affected and pushed them to be more sympathetic and supportive of GAM. He assessed that such methods had the effect of escalating the level of violence, was disruptive of Acehnese society and inflicted wounds on them which proved difficult to heal. As Amnesty International noted:\n\nAmnesty International documented the use of arbitrary arrests, extra-legal detention, summary executions, rape and scorch-earth as features of the Indonesian military's push against GAM since 1990. Among the more chilling acts observed by Amnesty International was the public disposal of the bodies of victims of summary executions or \"Petrus Killings\" (\"Penembakan Misterius\") to serve as warnings to Acehnese to refrain from joining or supporting GAM. The following was Amnesty International's description of such acts:\n\nAnother questionable tactic of the TNI was the so-called \"civil-military operations\" in which civilians were compelled to participate in intelligence and security operations. A notorious example of this was the \"Operasi Pagar Betis\" (or \"Fence of Legs\") as described by Amnesty International below:\n\nDamien Kingsbury, who served as adviser to the GAM leadership in Stockholm and Helsinki during the Helsinki peace talks in 2005, contended that the Indonesian military had vested interests to keep the conflict at a level which would justify their presence in the restive province. The ICG also asserted in a 2003 report that, \"Aceh is simply too lucrative a place for military officers who rely so heavily on non-budgetary sources of income.\"\n\nKingsbury and Lesley McCulloch outlined the following business activities allegedly conducted by the Indonesian military in Aceh:\n\nThe declaration of martial law by the Indonesian government in May 2003 had resulted in a concerted push by the Indonesian military against GAM. The ICG reported that by mid-2004, GAM's supply lines and communications had been seriously disrupted. It was also more difficult for them to move about, and their presence in urban areas was largely rooted out. As a result, GAM's command in Pidie had instructed all field commanders by telephone to pull back from the \"sagoe\" (sub-district) to the \"daerah\" (district) base and that henceforth military actions could only be undertaken on the order of the \"daerah\" commander and with the permission of the \"wilayah\" (regional) commander. Previously, when GAM was in a stronger position, its sagoe level units could exercise a great level of command autonomy to initiate military actions on their own.\n\nAccording to then Indonesian Armed Forces Commander General Endriartono Sutarto, the security forces succeeded in cutting the size of GAM's forces by 9,593—which presumably included surrenders, captures, and deaths. While doubting that the figure was accurate, most observers would agree that the renewed military push against GAM following the martial law declaration had dealt substantial damage to GAM.\n\nHowever, Aspinall noted that most GAM leaders whom he had interviewed, particularly the field officers, were adamant that their acceptance of the Helsinki MoU was not due to their military weakness. Former-GAM leader Irwandi Yusuf, who would go on to be the governor of Aceh through its inaugural direct gubernatorial elections on 11 December 2006, ventured that far from collapsing, the situation of GAM was actually improving as the sick and infirm were captured by the Indonesian military which left those still in the field to be unencumbered by them. However, despite the commitment of GAM forces to fight on, GAM's leaders might have, at that point, given up hope that a military victory over the government forces would be possible. In the words of former GAM prime minister Malik Mahmud to Aspinall in October 2005: \"The existing strategies applied by both parties had caused a costly stalemate\". When asked by Jakarta Post to comment on whether accepting the Helsinki MoU was a face-saving measure by GAM in the face of military setbacks, Malik said:\n\nThe international opinion following the tsunami also had a bearing on the importance placed on the Helsinki peace talks undertaken by both the Indonesian government and GAM. Both sides had sent senior ranking officials as negotiators while during the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (CoHA) talks which was signed in December 2002, representation was at a relatively junior level.\n\nGAM leaders had also assessed during the Helsinki peace talks that there was no support from the international community for Aceh's independence aspiration. With regard to this, Malik said:\n\nIn explaining to the GAM commanders the acceptance of self-government instead of continuing to struggle for independence, GAM leaders stressed that if they continued to insist on fighting for independence even after the 2004 tsunami, they would risk being isolated by the international community.\n\nIn October 2004, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) and Vice-President Jusuf Kalla were sworn in following the first ever direct presidential elections in 2004. Aspinall argued that before this, there was a balance between those in the Indonesian government who believed that a military victory was impossible and that negotiations were needed and hardliners who held on to the view that GAM could be entirely eliminated—the election of SBY and Kalla had tipped the balance in favour of the former position.\n\nHe pointed out that while SBY was still a minister in the Cabinet of President Megawati Soekarnoputri, he had supported an \"integrated approach\" in which military measures were accompanied by efforts to negotiate with GAM. Kalla, then a ministerial colleague of SBY's, also supported the restarting of talks with GAM in early-2004 (a time when the martial law in Aceh was still in effect and the military operation was in full swing). During this time, Kalla, through his trusted intermediaries, made approaches to GAM's commanders in the field as well as its leadership in Sweden. The positions of both the president and vice-president of Indonesia in favour of negotiations as a solution to the Aceh insurgency thus provided a platform for the eventual success of the Helsinki peace talks.\n\nKingsbury, an official advisor to GAM, also credited the election of SBY and Kalla in 2004 as providing the impetus for the peace efforts which led to the eventual agreement. In particular, he pointed out that the appointment of Kalla to oversee the Indonesian delegation for the peace talks was crucial because Kalla's status as the general chairman of Golkar, at that time the largest party in the Indonesian legislature, allowed SBY's government to deal effectively with any opposition coming from the parliament.\n\nIn April 2013, Amnesty International released the \"Time To Face The Past\" report in which the organisation states that \"most victims and their relatives have long been denied truth, justice and reparation in violation of Indonesia’s obligation under international law. They are still waiting for local and national Indonesian authorities to acknowledge and remedy what happened to them and their loved ones during the conflict.\" For the formulation of the report, Amnesty International employed the findings that it collected during a visit to Aceh in May 2012. During this visit, organisational representatives spoke with non-governmental organisations (NGOs), community organisations, lawyers, parliamentarians, local government officials, journalists, and victims and their representatives about the situation in Aceh at the time of the interviews. While victims expressed their appreciation of the peace process and the increased security in the Aceh province, they conveyed their frustration at the lack of action from the Indonesian government in regard to the 2005 memorandum of understanding (MOU), in which a plan for the setting up of a Human Rights Court for Aceh and an Aceh Truth and Reconciliation Commission is documented.\n\nMoreover, the \"Time To Face The Past\" report contains a warning in light of the potential for renewed violence that exists in Aceh if the Indonesian government remains stagnant in relation to its commitments from the 2005 MOU. Amnesty International's deputy Asia Pacific director Isabelle Arradon explained during the launch of the report: \"The situation is breeding resentment that could sow the seeds of a future return to violence\". As of 19 April 2013, the Indonesian government had not issued a response to the report and a presidential spokesman informed the BBC news service that he was unable to comment as he had not read the report.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "144930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144930", "title": "James Mark Baldwin", "text": "James Mark Baldwin\n\nJames Mark Baldwin (January 12, 1861, Columbia, South Carolina – November 8, 1934, Paris) was an American philosopher and psychologist who was educated at Princeton under the supervision of Scottish philosopher James McCosh and who was one of the founders of the Department of Psychology at the university. He made important contributions to early psychology, psychiatry, and to the theory of evolution.\n\nBaldwin was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina. His father, who was from Connecticut, was an abolitionist and was known to purchase slaves in order to free them. During the Civil War his father moved north, but the family remained in their home until the time of Sherman's March. Upon their return after the war, Baldwin's father was part of the Reconstruction Era government. Baldwin was sent north to receive his secondary education in New Jersey. As a result, he chose to attend the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University).\n\nBaldwin started in theology under the tutelage of the college's president, James McCosh, but soon switched to philosophy. He was awarded the Green Fellowship in Mental Science (named after his future father-in-law, the head of the Princeton Theological Seminary) and used it to study in Germany with Wilhelm Wundt at Leipzig and with Friedrich Paulsen at Berlin (1884–1934).\n\nIn 1885 he became Instructor in French and German at the Princeton Theological Seminary. He translated Théodule-Armand Ribot's \"German Psychology of Today\" and wrote his first paper \"The Postulates of a Physiological Psychology\". Ribot's work traced the origins of psychology from Immanuel Kant through Johann Friedrich Herbart, Gustav Theodor Fechner, Hermann Lotze to Wundt.\n\nIn 1887, while working as a professor of philosophy at Lake Forest College he married Helen Hayes Green, the daughter of the President of the Seminary, William Henry Green. At Lake Forest he published the first part of his \"Handbook of Psychology (Senses and Intellect)\" in which he directed attention to the new experimental psychology of Ernst Heinrich Weber, Fechner and Wundt.\n\nIn 1889 he went to the University of Toronto as the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics. His creation of a laboratory of experimental psychology at Toronto (which he claimed was the first in the British Empire) coincided with the birth of his daughters Helen (1889) and Elizabeth (1891) which inspired the quantitative and experimental research on infant development that was to make such a vivid impression on Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg through Baldwin's \"Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes\" (1894) dedicated to the subject.\nA second part of \"Handbook of Psychology (Feeling and Will)\" appeared in 1891.\n\nDuring this creative phase Baldwin traveled to France (1892) to visit the important psychologists Charcot (at the Salpêtrière), Hippolyte Bernheim (at Nancy), and Pierre Janet.\n\nIn 1893 he was called back to his alma mater, Princeton University, where he was offered the Stuart Chair in Psychology and the opportunity to establish a new psychology laboratory. He would stay at Princeton until 1903 working out the highlights of his career reflected in \"Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development: A Study in Social Psychology\" (1897) where he took his previous \"Mental Development\" to the critical stage in which it survived in the work of Lev Vygotsky, through Vygotsky in the crucial work of Alexander Luria, and in the synthesis of both by Aleksey Leontyev. He also edited the English editions of Karl Groos's \"Play of Animals\" (1898) and \"Play of Men\" (1901).\n\nIt was during this time that Baldwin wrote \"A New Factor of Evolution\" (June 1896/\"The American Naturalist\") which later became known as the \"Baldwin Effect\". But other important contributors should not be overlooked. Conwy Lloyd Morgan was perhaps closest to understanding the so-called \"Baldwin Effect\". In his \"Habit and Instinct\" (1896) he phrased a comparable version of the theory, as he did in an address to a session of the New York Academy of Sciences (February 1896) in the presence of Baldwin. (1896/\"Of modification and variation\".\" Science\" 4(99) (November 20):733-739). As did Henry Fairfield Osborn (1896/\"A mode of evolution requiring neither natural selection nor the inheritance of acquired characteristics\". \"Transactions of the New York Academy of Science\" 15:141-148). The \"Baldwin Effect\", building in part on the principle of \"organic selection\" proposed by Baldwin in \"Mental Development\" did only receive its name from George Gaylord Simpson in 1953. (in: \"Evolution\" 7:110-117) (see: David J. Depew in \"Evolution and Learning\" M.I.T. 2003)\n\nBaldwin complemented his psychological work with philosophy, in particular epistemology his contribution to which he presented in the presidential address to the American Psychological Association in 1897. By then the work on the \"Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology\" (1902) had been announced and a period of intense philosophical correspondence ensued with the contributors to the project: William James, John Dewey, Charles Sanders Peirce, Josiah Royce, George Edward Moore, Bernard Bosanquet, James McKeen Cattell, Edward B. Titchener, Hugo Münsterberg, Christine Ladd-Franklin, Adolf Meyer, George Stout, Franklin Henry Giddings, Edward Bagnall Poulton and others.\n\nIn 1899 Baldwin went to Oxford to supervise the completion of the \"Dictionary\"... (1902). He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Science at Oxford University. (In the light of the foregoing, the deafening silence with which J. M. Baldwin was later treated in Oxford publications on the mind may well come to be regarded as one of the significant omissions in the history of ideas for the 20th century. Compare for example Richard Gregory: \"The Oxford Companion to the Mind\", first edition, 1987.)\n\nIn 1903, partly as a result of a dispute with Princeton president Woodrow Wilson and in part due to an offer involving more pay and less teaching, he moved to a professorship of philosophy and psychology at Johns Hopkins University. Here, he re-opened the experimental laboratory that had been founded by G. Stanley Hall in 1884 (but had closed with Hall's departure to take over the presidency of Clark University in 1888).\n\nIn Baltimore Baldwin started to work on \"Thoughts and Things: A Study of the Development and Meaning of Thought, Or Genetic Logic\" (1906), a densely integrative rendering of his ideas culminating in \"Genetic Theory of Reality: Being the Outcome of Genetic Logic as Issuing in the Aesthetic Theory of Reality called Pancalism\" (1915). This book introduced the concept that knowledge grows through childhood in a series of distinct stages that involve interaction between innate abilities and environmental feedback. He further stated that the initial physical development gives way to language and cognitive abilities such that the child emerges as a result of social and physical growth.\n\nIn Baltimore also Baldwin was arrested in a raid on a \"colored\" brothel (1908), a scandal that put an end to his American career. Forced to leave Johns Hopkins he looked for residence in Paris. He was to reside in France till his death in 1934.\n\nHis first years (1908–1912) in France were interrupted by long stays in Mexico where he advised on university matters and lectured at the School of Higher Studies at the National University in Mexico City. His \"Darwin and the Humanities\" (1909) and \"Individual and Society\" (1911) date from this period.\nIn 1912 he took permanent residence in Paris.\n\nBaldwin's residence in France resulted in his pointing out the urgency of American non-neutral support for his new hosts on the French battlefields of World War I. He published \"American Neutrality, Its Cause and Cure\" (1916) for the purpose, and when in 1916 he survived a German torpedo attack on the in the English Channel – on the return trip from a visit to William Osler at Oxford – his open telegram to the President of the United States on the affair became frontpage news (\"New York Times\"). With the entry of America in the war (1917) he helped to organize the Paris branch of the American Navy League, acting as its Chairman till 1922. In 1926 his memoirs \"Between Two Wars (1861-1921)\" were published. He died in Paris on November 8, 1934.\n\nBaldwin was prominent among early experimental psychologists and was voted by his peers as the fifth most important psychologist in America in a 1903 survey conducted by James McKeen Cattell, but it was his contributions to developmental psychology that were the most important. His stepwise theory of cognitive development was a major influence on the later, and much more widely known, developmental theory of Jean Piaget. Equally important is his contribution to the development of what is currently known as Theory of Mind (ToM). His ideas on the relationship of Ego and Alter were developed by Pierre Janet; while his stress on how \"My sense of self grows by imitation of you...an imitative creation\" contributed to the mirror stage of Jacques Lacan.\n\nHis contributions to the young discipline's early journals and institutions were highly significant as well. Baldwin was a co-founder (with James McKeen Cattell) of \"Psychological Review\" (which was founded explicitly to compete with G. Stanley Hall's \"American Journal of Psychology\"), \"Psychological Monographs\" and \"Psychological Index.\" He was also the founding editor of \"Psychological Bulletin\".\n\nIn 1892 he was vice-president of the International Congress of Psychology held in London, and in 1897–1898 president of the American Psychological Association; he received a gold medal from the Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences of Denmark (1897), and was honorary president of the International Congress of Criminal Anthropology held in Geneva in 1896.\n\nThe idea of organic selection came from the interpretation of the observable data in Baldwin's experimental study of infant reaching and its role in mental development. Every practice of the infant's movement intended to advance the integration of behavior favorable to development in the experimental framework appeared to be selected from an excess of movement in the trial of imitation.\n\nIn further stages of development – the ones most critical to an understanding of the evolution of mind – this was graphically illustrated in the child's efforts to draw and learning to write. (\"Mental Development in the Child and the Race\")\n\nIn later editions of \"Mental Development\" Baldwin changed the term \"\"organic\" selection\" into \"\"functional\" selection\".\n\nSo, from the outset the idea was well linked to the philosophy of mind Baldwin was emancipating from the models inspired by divine pre-establishment. (Spinoza) (Wozniak, 2001)\n\nIt is the communication of this insight into the practice-related nature of dynamogenic development, above all its integration as a creative factor in the fabric of society, that helped the students of Baldwin to understand what was left of Lamarck's signature. Singularly illustrated by Gregory Bateson in \"Mind and Nature\" (1979) and reintegrated in contemporary studies by Terrence Deacon (\"The Symbolic Species: The co-evolution of language and the human brain\", 1997) and other scholars of biosemiotics.\n\nIn the human species the faculty of niche building is favored by a practical intelligence able to design the circumstances that will put its vital acquirements out of harm's way in terms of (linearly predicted) natural selection. It is precisely in the fields of study relating to massive selection pressures against which other species seem to be without defenses – biological development in the face of novel pandemics (AIDS, mad cow disease) – that the arguments relative to the natural heredity of intelligent acquirements have resurfaced in a way most challenging to science.\n\nBaldwin's most important theoretical legacy is the concept of the Baldwin effect or \"Baldwinian evolution\". Baldwin proposed, against the neo-Lamarckians of his day (most notably Edward Drinker Cope), that there is a mechanism whereby epigenetic factors come to shape the congenital endowment as much as – or more than – natural selection pressures. In particular, human behavioral decisions made and sustained across generations as a set of cultural practices ought to be considered among the factors shaping the human genome.\n\nFor example, the incest taboo, if powerfully enforced, removes the natural selection pressure against the possession of incest-favoring instincts. After a few generations without this natural selection pressure, unless such genetic material were profoundly fixed, it would tend to diversify and lose its function. Humans would no longer be innately averse to incest, but would rely on their capacity to internalize such rules from cultural practices.\n\nThe opposite case can also be true: cultural practice might selectively breed humans to meet the fitness conditions of new environments, cultural and physical, which earlier hominids could not have survived. Baldwinian evolution might strengthen or weaken a genetic trait.\n\nBaldwin's contribution to this field places him at the heart of contemporary controversies in the fields of evolutionary psychology and wider sociobiology. Few people did more than Robert Wozniak, Professor of Psychology at Bryn Mawr College, for the rediscovery of the significance of James Mark Baldwin in the history of ideas.\n\nApart from articles in the \"Psychological Review\", Baldwin wrote:\n\nHe also largely contributed to the \"Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology\" (1901–1905), of which he was editor in-chief.\n\n\nHothersall, David (2004). \"History of Psychology\" (4th ed.).

{"id": "44757179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44757179", "title": "Nineteenth-century theatrical scenery", "text": "Nineteenth-century theatrical scenery\n\nTheatre in the nineteenth century was noted for its changing philosophy from the Romanticism and Neoclassicism that dominated Europe since the late 18th century to Realism and Naturalism in the latter half of the 19th century before it eventually gave way to the rise of Modernism in the 20th century. Scenery in theater at the time closely mirrored these changes and, with the onset of the Industrial Revolution and technological advancement throughout the century, dramatically changed the aesthetics of the theater.\n\nTheatrical realism was a general movement in 19th-century theatre from the time period of 1870-1960 that developed a set of dramatic and theatrical conventions with the aim of bringing a greater fidelity of real life to texts and performances. Part of a broader artistic movement, it included a focus on everyday middle-class drama, ordinary speech, and simple settings. This idea of representing subject matter truthfully, was evident in the changes that were made to scenic design in theater. Theatrical designers and directors began meticulously researching historical accuracy for their productions, which meant that scenery could no longer be drawn from stock - which was typically used over and over again in generic settings for different shows. Scenery began to be custom-designed and made for specific production. This meant, while scenery used to be seen as capital investment, it was not considered to be more disposable when the production was removed from the repertory.\n\nOne of the most important scenic transition into the century was from the often-used two-dimensional scenic backdrop to three-dimensional sets. Previously, as a two-dimensional environment, scenery did not provide an embracing, physical environment for the dramatic action happening on stage. This changed when three-dimensional sets were introduced in the first half of the century. This, coupled with change in audience and stage dynamic as well as advancement in theater architecture that allowed for hidden scene changes, the theater became more representational instead of presentational, and invited audience to be transported to a conceived 'other' world.\n\nThe epitome of the new three-dimensional style sets and one of the most important advancement of scenic design was the popularization of the box set. The box set has been around since the 17th century, but lacked support. Madame Vestris had introduced realistic stage furnishing in 1836 at her little Olympic Theatre in London, and forced them on American managers when she toured that country in 1838-1839. The box set was a gradual replacement of the painted wing-and-shutter sets. Between 1800 and 1875, many theater artists began to use them. A box set consists of flats hinged together to represent a room; it often has practicable elements, such as doors and windows, which can be used during the course of a play or show. With the new pursuit of realism, room-like box settings now had heavy molding, real doors with doorknobs, and ample accurate furniture. Having the box set also meant that many theater artists began to stage all the action behind the proscenium in the late 1800s, thus reinforcing the illusion of a fourth wall. Audiences would be watching a “slice of life” through a window. Box sets allowed scenic designers to create better visualized atmospheres and moods.\n\n19th-century scenic styles in America were unique derivations from the European masters. Scenic artists from Europe brought with them the Romantic, Baroque, or classical landscapes that they knew from their homes, but the styles seemed to change when they landed on the American shore. The romantic English landscape painting style slowly adapted to the American image. The more rugged wild-western American landscape came to be idealized by native scenic artists throughout the century. Many theatres invested in generic scenery meant for virtually any production. An all-purpose set included landscapes, European cities, prison, palace, village, mountain pass, and forest.\n\nThe oleo was a versatile drop for any sort of entertainment. The oleo drop often hung in the in-one position, subdividing the stage into a shallower depth that was more appropriate for a brief interlude. The act curtain or drop curtain functioned as today's main drape, the decorative divider wall between audience and stage. Often, it was the most elaborate piece a theater owned and was painted to harmonize with the interior decorations of the theater itself.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, the technology of the industrial revolution was applied to theater. Many historians believe that the popularity of melodrama, with its emphasis on stage spectacle and special effects, accelerated these technological innovations: For example, Dion Boucicault was responsible for the introduction of fireproofing in the theater when one of his melodramatic plays called for an onstage fire.\n\nWhile the invention of the panorama is attributed to Robert Barker in 1787, Louis Jacques Daguerre is largely seen as having perfected the invention in the 19th century. He created the diorama: a still painting viewed by an audience sitting on a rotating platform. This soon gave way to the moving panorama: a setting painted on a long cloth, which could be unrolled across the stage by turning spools, created an illusion of movement and changing locales. A popular American play, William Dunlap's \"A Trip to Niagara\" (1828), used this device to show a voyage from New York City to Niagara Falls via a steamboat. The advent of the panoramas coupled with Charles Kean’s invention of the Corsican trap meant that entire horse and chariots races could be enacted on stage. The emphasis on recreating natural environments onstage was probably influenced by romanticism, which called for a \"return to nature.\" \n\nOn February 7, 1880, The Spirit of the Times announced: \"Tonight Mr. J. Steele MacKaye will open the most exquisite theatre in the world, and all New York will assemble to do honor to the realization of his artistic visions…Mr. MacKaye will play the drama \"Hazel Kirke\" through with only two-minute waits between the acts, and will then exhibit the double stage—one compartment set for the kitchen of Blackburn Mill and other as boudoir at Fairy Grove Villa.\" MacKaye’s elevator stage was an important development of American drama and theatre. It was a solution to the problem posed by the increasing use of box sets to reproduce interior scenes in detail. With the elevator stage, multiple scenes could be changed in a fast and detailed way. This greatly improved the speed and efficiency of scenic changes, and that design didn’t have to be simplified, they could still be detailed. \nThe elevator stage was described in \"Scientific American\", April 5, 1884.\n\"[It consists] of two theatrical stages, one above another, to be moved up and down as an elevator car is operated in a high building, and so that either one of them can easily and quickly be at any time brought to the proper level for acting thereon in front of the auditorium. While the play is proceeding before the audience, the assistants arrange another scene on the upper stage.\"\n\nNew styles of scenery meant that new means of scene shifting were needed. Booth's Theatre, opened in 1869, was the first in a new generation of theaters built specifically to suit three-dimensional set pieces. It was the first theater to have a level stage floor (rather than a raked floor, as had been the standard in proscenium-arch theaters since the Renaissance) and no grooves in the stage floor for shifting flats. This idea would become the standard by the end of the century. Elevators and equipment for flying scenery also complemented the space.\n\nNineteenth-century technology revolutionized stage lighting, which until then had been primitive. The introduction of gas lighting was the first step. In 1816, Philadelphia's Chestnut Street Theater became the earliest gas-lit playhouse in the world. The introduction of gas lighting revolutionized stage lighting. It provided a somewhat more natural and adequate light for the playing and the scenic space upstage of the proscenium arch. However, this new richness in lighting provided difficulties at first. Though scenic painters had to learn to subdue their colors to the increased candle-power, the brightness only further highlight the disparity between three-dimensional set pieces and their two-dimensional backdrop and led to the latter's eventual decline. \nThe advent of limelight, also known as Drummond light, also effectively introduced spotlighting to theater. Thomas Edison's electric incandescent lamp, invented in 1879, was the next step. It made electricity the most flexible, most controllable, and safest form of lighting, in the twentieth century, it would make stage lighting design a true art. These new means of illumination tremendously increased the control over stage light and stimulated interest in imitating lighting phenomena of nature.\n\nIt was during this time that scenic artist began to be recognized for their work. Many of the scenic artists operated their own scenic studios in New York and towards the latter half of the century, the first theatrical unions were formed as a response to the Theatre Syndicate. Producing who originally hired staff carpenters and company painters began to place their productions out to bid. It was also during this time period that designers began working with models to convey their design.\n\n\n\n\nThe end of the 19th century witnessed both the height and the end of scenery painted in traditional perspective. Scenic design was realistic and creative that released the audience’s imagination. Realism was but a passing style. Towards the end of the century, realism would find an opposite in naturalism. Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig would be the ones to revolt against the idea of the actor standing on a flat floor surrounded by “realistic” painted canvases. Their controversial ideas would be the basis of the New Stagecraft. The 20th century would bring the scenic designer an entirely new aesthetic for the world of the theatre in the form of Henrik Ibsen and Modernism. As movies replaced theatre’s popularity, an international aesthetic weighed in against painted scenery, scenic studios began to shrink, and scenic artists began to disappear. The golden age of scenic painting of the 19th century rapidly turned to a much more fragmented one in 20th century, as theatre styles changed radically and eventually the theatre lost popularity to movies and television.\n\nBeudert, Susan Crabtree & Peter.

In the history of literature, it is often studied in connection with orality, performance, and patronage. \n\nAs a term of literary criticism, \"occasional poetry\" describes the work's purpose and the poet's relation to subject matter. It is not a genre, but several genres originate as occasional poetry, including epithalamia (wedding songs), dirges or funerary poems, paeans, and victory odes. Occasional poems may also be composed exclusive of or within any given set of genre conventions to commemorate single events or anniversaries, such as birthdays, foundings, or dedications.\n\nOccasional poetry is often lyric because it originates as performance, in antiquity and into the 16th century even with musical accompaniment; at the same time, because performance implies an audience, its communal or public nature can place it in contrast with the intimacy or personal expression of emotion often associated with the term \"lyric\".\n\nOccasional poetry was a significant and even characteristic form of expression in ancient Greek and Roman culture, and has continued to play a prominent if sometimes aesthetically debased role throughout Western literature. Poets whose body of work features occasional poetry that stands among their highest literary achievements include Pindar, Horace, Ronsard, Jonson, Dryden, Milton, Goethe, Yeats, and Mallarmé. In the 18th century, particularly in Germany, occasional poems were often written by women, a phenomenon that has been the subject of feminist literary criticism. The occasional poem (French \"pièce d'occasion\", German \"Gelegenheitsgedichte\") is also important in Persian, Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese literature, and its ubiquity among virtually all world literatures suggests the centrality of occasional poetry in the origin and development of poetry as an art form.\n\nGoethe declared that \"Occasional Poetry is the highest kind,\" and Hegel gave it a central place in the philosophical examination of how poetry interacts with life:\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, newspapers in the United States often published occasional poems, and memorial poems for floods, train accidents, mine disasters and the like were frequently written as lyrics in ballad stanzas.\n\nA high-profile example of a 21st century occasional poem is Elizabeth Alexander's \"Praise Song for the Day,\" written for Barack Obama's 2009 US presidential inauguration, and read by the poet during the event to a television audience of around 38 million.\n\n"}

He is sometimes known in the literature as \"Riccobaldo da Ferrara\" according to the Italian form, or as \"Riccobaldo Ferrarese\" or as \"Riccolbaldo\"\n\nHe was born in Ferrara or in the surrounding area, most probably in 1246, his father being one Bonmercato. On 4 October 1251, as a \"puer\" (\"boy\"), he was a witness to the passage through Ferrara of Pope Innocent IV; on 17 February 1264, as an \"adulescens\" (\"adolescent\"), he was present during the funeral at Ferrara of Azzo VII d'Este; he appeared as a witness to a statute of Ferrara of 15 December 1274; in May 1282 he was to be found at Faenza; in 1290 he applied his seal to three documents at Reggio Emilia, where he served as notary to the vicar (deputy) of Obizzo II d'Este, the city’s \"podestà\". He is known to have been at Padua in 1293, at Ravenna in 1297-1300, exercising his profession at Ferrara in 1308, once again in Padua at unspecified period between 1308 and 1313, and at Ferrara in 1310. He died some time after 1318.\n\nThe claims that his real name was Gervasio (Gervase), that he belonged to the Mainardi family, and that he was for a time a canon in Ravenna, are doubtless products of somewhat approximate sixteenth- and seventeenth-century scholarship. One thing that is certain, because he himself says us so, is that he bore the titles of \"dominus\" (\"lord\") and \"magister\" (\"master\"). Since Riccobaldo refers to himself as an \"exile\", attempts have been made to see such an exile as a result of Riccobaldo's lending his support to Aldobrandino II in the latter’s clash with his brother Azzo VIII, Lord of Ferrara. However, this hypothesis has to date found no evidence to back it up. That he had no love for the Este family can easily be seen in some of his works, but it is not discernible in others, and so important questions remain unclear. As remarked, Riccobaldo was notary to the vicar (deputy) of Obizzo II d'Este and in Ravenna he appears to have lived in the shadow of Obizzo Sanvitale, Archbishop of Ravenna, a known supporter of the Este family. Yet in 1308 Riccobaldo can be found in Ferrara, swearing fidelity to the Church of Rome immediately after the expulsion of the Este family from the lordship of the city. What should be made of these apparent contradictions.\n\nRiccobaldo witnessed, at times at very close quarters, the political events in his city, and was sometimes a witness, too, of what happened in the history of Italy as a whole, even in works of his that were not strictly historical, but more of a geographical character.\n\nAs to Riccobaldo‘s own cultural story, this is in part fairly clearly established, though in some respects it has not yet been investigated, even if considerable research is underway. Only recently has it been possible to attribute to him a political \"carmen\" (song) in Latin which celebrates the newly acquired freedom of his city, Ferrara. In this text there are obvious citations of various earlier Latin lyrics, a fact that shows a considerable personal culture for the period. While the lyrics passed off in the seventeenth century as Riccobaldo‘s by Girolamo Baruffaldi are certainly not genuine, we still need once more to take into consideration the fact that he had the title of \"magister\" (\"master\") and that phrase of his in his old age where Riccobaldo says he is now dedicated \"melioribus studiis\" (\"to the better kind of study\" or \"to better pursuits\").\n\nBy his own explicit admission, his first impulse to write came from his contact with the archives firstly of Nonantola and then of Ravenna. In Ravenna he came to know, as he himself recounts, the \"Chronicon\", that is to say the \"Historia Ecclesiastica\" of Eusebius of Caesarea, in the \"Chronicon\" (\"Chronicle\") of Saint Jerome, and in all probability also the so-called \"Ravenna Cosmography\"; at Nonantola he certainly had access to the sequel to Jerome’s work, written this time by Saint Prosper of Aquitaine.\n\nAmong the numerous works he knew were the dictionary \"Elementarium doctrinae rudimentum\" of Papias, the short \"Chronicon\" of Saint Isidore of Seville (attributed by Riccobaldo to a bishop Miletus; then some decades of Livy’s ‘’Ab Urbe Condita\" (History of Rome); the \"Historiae adversus paganos\" (\"Histories against the Pagans\") of Paulus Orosius, the great encyclopedic work by Marziano Capella entitled \"Itinerarium Antonini\", Pliny the Elder’s \"Naturalis historia\" (\"Natural History\"), the \"Collectanea rerum memorabilium\" (\"Collection of Curiosities\") of Solinus, the work of compilation by the Dominican Martin of Opava, which Riccobaldo cites as the \"Martiniana\", parts of the \"Legenda aurea\" (\"Golden Legend\") by Jacobus de Voragine, the version of Eutropius drawn up by Paul the Deacon and the \"Historia Langobardorum\" (\"History of the Lombards\"), the abbreviated version of the \"Philippic Histories\" of Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus or Pompey Trogue composed by Justin, Florus, the \"Pharsalia\" of Lucan, something of the writings of Seneca the Younger (certainly including the \"De consolatione ad Helviam\" and \"De clementia\" (\"On Clemency\"), Suetonius’s \"Vitae Caesarum\" (\"Lives of the Twelve Caesars\"), the \"Navigatio Sancti Brendani\" (\"The Sea Voyage of St Brendan\"), Servius’s commentary on the Aeneid, works of Pomponius Mela, the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle \"(Historia Caroli Magni\", the \"Historia scholastica\" by Peter Comestor (a biblical paraphrase written in Latin), Boethius's \"De consolatione philosophiae\" \"(The Consolation of Philosophy)\", Juvenal, the Latin translation by Rufinus of Aquileia of Eusebius of Caesarea’s \"Historia Ecclesiastica\", Agnellus of Ravenna.\n\nAfter this the list becomes very impressive as to quantity and quality when we find Riccobaldo at grips with Julius Caesar, at least the problematic \"De bello Alexandrino\", along with \"De bello Africo\" and \"De bello Hispaniensi\" (\"On the Alexandrine War\", \"On the African War\", \"On the Hispanic War\"); Cicero’s \"Laelius de amicitia\" (\"Laelius on Friendship\"’) and \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\" (\"Rhetoric: For Herennius\"), and other works, too. We can add the \"Distichs of Cato\" (\"Catonis Disticha\"), Einhard, Hegesippus, Horace, certain texts to be found in the so-called \"Spicilegium Ravennatis historiae\"; Virgil, perhaps the Dominican Vincent of Beauvais, and the manuscripts of the Abbey of Santa Giustina in Padua, without excluding others still.\n\nFor this very considerable widening of his learning, Riccobaldo certainly owed a great deal to his mixing in the circles of the pre-humanists of Padua, from whom he learned much, but to whom he probably also gave not a little. In any case, there is no overlooking Riccobaldo nowadays as a figure of first rank in the history of Italian culture, despite his having been neglected even in relatively recent times by historians who were otherwise not without merit.\n\nOther works by Riccobaldo, apart from those listed below, are his geographical compilations, one of which, the \"De locis orbis\", was published for the first time only in 1986, while the other, \"De origine urbium Italie\", had in 2013 still not been published.

While neither can be dated with any precision, the first of these works if fully of his marure period, and the second from his last years.\n\n\n"}

The Société is a registered charity funded through subscriptions, donations and legacies.\n\nOn 28 January 1873 a meeting of notables of the island took place to discuss the formation of a society for the preservation of the island's archaeological, historical and linguistic heritage, perceived to be threatened by the expansion of St Helier and coastal development. Those present were aware of the foundation of similar societies in mainland Normandy, such as (founded 1824) and similar county societies in the United Kingdom. In 1893 the Société was given a large townhouse in Saint Helier which became the base for its operations including its library and museum. In 1913 the various branches of activity were formalised into 'sections', amongst the first being Archaeology and History. The Section structure still exists and now comprise some 15 sections.\n\nFrom its inception the Société engaged in archaeological work at numerous sites around the island; most importantly beginning work at La Cotte de St Brelade in 1905, a Neanderthal site of international importance. In 1919 the Société purchased the important Neolithic site of La Hougue Bie, excavating it in 1924 revealing a Neolithic chambered passage grave c.4000BC. The site was then restored and opened as a museum. The Sociéte flourished throughout the 20th century, notwithstanding the difficult years of the German military occupation of the Channel Islands between 1940–1945. Despite the severe hardships and lack of resources suffered by the island, the museum at Pier Rd remained open throughout the Occupation, but despite protestations La Hougue Bie museum was requisitioned for military purposes by the Nazi occupiers.\n\nPost-war the Société continued to grow and add to its collections to the extent that during the 1970s a new headquarters was built adjoining the Pier Road Museum. In 1987 the Société entered into an agreement with the States of Jersey for its museums to be run by the Jersey Heritage Trust, whilst retaining ownership of its collections. This enabled the Société to concentrate on its core activities of research and publication. In 1990 the Société also entered into a working partnership with the National Trust for Jersey which its members had helped to found in 1937, to develop a country life museum at Hamptonne, St Lawrence, a late medieval farm with manorial pretensions, the National Trust purchasing the property, the Société financing the restoration. Presently, the Société has approximately 2,000 members.\n\nThe Société library contains much unique and important material about Jersey and comparative academic literature in the form of published works and manuscript documents including maps. The Société employs a professional librarian.\n\nThe Société Jersiaise Photographic Archive contains, as a result of the foresight of early members, by far the most important collection of historic photographic images of the island. A professional photographic archivist is employed by the Société to manage the collection of approximately 100,000 images dating from the mid-1840s to the present day.\n\nNow curated by Jersey Heritage the Société's extensive museum collections contain items on all aspects of Jersey life, in particular Jersey's archaeological heritage but also. This remains the only substantial collection of Jersey material and is continually expanded by purchase and donation of new pieces, most recently (as of August 2012) a complete Neolithic jadeite ring (anneau-disque) which had been discovered in Jersey in the late 1980s but sold by the finder to a private collector in the USA.\n\nMuch of the work of the Société is published in its \"Bulletin Annuel\" commenced in 1875. In addition, the Société has published many works of its members and other scholars. In its early years the Société published many primary sources, such as the Cartulaire des Îles and Actes des États de Jersey to enable its members and others to carry out primary research. Latterly, it has published many secondary works produced by its members and other scholars, many of which remain in print.\n\nThe \"Bulletin\" has been digitised and is available to view on their website.\n\nThe Société currently employs a full-time field archaeologist funded by the generous private benefaction of a member. This is the only such position in Jersey. His work greatly enhances the Archaeology Section's contribution to new research in the field of Jersey's archaeology.\n\n\n\nNotable members have included Dr Robert Ranulph Marett, the leading early evolutionary anthropologist, whose father Robert Pipon Marett was a founder member; Dr Arthur Mourant FRS a noted haematologist and George Reginald Balleine historian and clergyman. Geraint Jennings, writer and politician, is also a member.\n\n\n"}

His work \"The Rise and Fall of the Judean State\" is about the Second Temple period.\n\nBorn in Chasniki, Russia, he attended the Gymnasium and later the Academy of Baron Gunzberg. There he met and formed a lifelong friendship with Zalman Shazar. In 1904 while in Russia he obtained Semikhah.

He received his doctorate in 1917 and became professor of Rabbinics. Zeitlin taught at Yeshiva College in New York for two years before going to Dropsie College in Philadelphia where he served as a Fellow in Rabbinics. He edited the academic journal, the Jewish Quarterly Review (JQR)(1940-1976). With A.A. Neuman he co-edited volumes 31–57, and continued as sole editor until his death in 1976. He controversially devoted considerable page-space of the JQR between 1949 and 1964 to engage in scholarly claim and counterclaim over the authenticity and pre-Christian origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Publishing some two dozen articles on the subject he remained convinced of their late date. . In the JQR July 1961 edition he published an article ″Jewish Rights in Palestine″ by British philosopher historian Arnold J. Toynbee and his own response ″Jewish Rights in Eretz Israel (Palestine)″ where he rebukes Toynbee for lack of scholarship. In addition to history he taught Talmud, wrote more than 400 articles and books and was instrumental in organizing the American Academy of Jewish Research. He never married and had no immediate survivors.\n\n\n\n"}

Compared to Rome, it was actually an advanced society and, in some ways, even more advanced than Rome. For example, many of the roads in Gaul that were assumed to have been built by the Romans were actually built by the Celts themselves. However, Gaul was rich and tempting to Rome. The Roman general, Julius Caesar, set out to conquer Gaul with a professional army. The Celts stood no chance against Caesar and the Romans and so today Rome's version of history is remembered.\n\nFirst broadcast 2 June 2006, it discusses Arminius, Trajan's Dacian Wars and Alaric I's sack of Rome.\n\nFirst broadcast 9 June 2006, it shows how Ancient Greeks and Persians were far from the Romans' view of them as effeminate and addicted to luxury. The Greeks valued science and mathematics, and the Persians had initially allowed multiculturalism among the different ethnic groups of its empire (until years of war with Rome).\n\nFirst broadcast 16 June 2006, this episode discusses two barbarian babies born in 400 AD. One would grow up to become the most feared of all, Attila the Hun. The other, Geiseric, led the Vandals whom history has cast as destroyers. It is claimed that Roman civilization ended not by the invasion of these tribes but by the loss of the African tax base. The common view of Rome and barbarians was a result of the Roman Catholic Church popularizing the Roman version of the truth.\n\n\n"}

His works include \"Chronicon Angliæ\", controversially attacking John of Gaunt, and \"Ypodigma Neustriæ\" (Chronicle of Normandy), justifying Henry V's invasion, and dedicated to him in 1419.\n\nHe is no relation to Sir Francis Walsingham, spymaster to Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nHe became a monk at St Albans, where he appears to have passed the whole of his monastic life, excepting a period from 1394 to 1396 during which he was prior of Wymondham Abbey, Norfolk, England, another Benedictine house. At St Albans he was in charge of the \"scriptorium\", or writing room, and he died about 1422.\n\nWalsingham is stated by Bale and Pits to have been a native of Norfolk. This is probably an inference from his name, as Walsingham is a village in that county. \nFrom an early period he was connected with the abbey of St Albans Abbey at St Albans, Hertfordshire, and was doubtless at school there. \nAn inconclusive passage in his \"Historia Anglicana\" has been taken as evidence that he was educated at Oxford. \nThe abbey of St. Albans, however, maintained particularly close relations with Oxford, sending its novices to be trained at St. Alban Hall and its monks at Gloucester College. \nIt is probable, therefore, that Walsingham was at the university.\n\nSubsequently, as the register book of benefactors of St. Albans Abbey preserved in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, shows, he held in the abbey not only the office of precentor, implying some musical education, but the more important one of scriptorarius, or superintendent of the copying-room. According to the register it was under Thomas de la Mare, who was abbot from 1350 to 1396, that he held these offices. \nBefore 1388, he compiled a work (\"Chronica Majora\") well known at that date as a book of reference. \nIn 1394, he was of standing sufficient to be promoted to the dignity of prior of Wymondham.\n\nHe ceased to be prior of Wymondham in 1396, and was recalled to St. Albans, where he composed his \"Ypodigma Neustriæ, or Demonstration of Events in Normandy,\" dedicated to Henry V, about 1419. His \"Historia Anglicana,\" indeed, is carried down to 1422, though it remains a matter of controversy whether the latter portion is from his pen. Nothing further is known of his life. Pits speaks of Walsingham's office of ‘scriptorarius’ at St. Albans Abbey as that of historiographer royal (regius historicus), and as bestowed on Walsingham by the abbot at the instance of the king. \nThis king, according to Bale and Pits, was Henry VI, for both of them assert that Walsingham flourished A.D. 1440. \nThe title of historiographer royal has probably no more basis than Bale's similar story of William Rishanger. \nBale makes his case worse by adding that Walsingham was the author of a work styled \"Acta Henrici Sexti.\" \nThis is now unknown. \nIf the ‘Chronica Majora’ was written, as must be supposed, at the latest not long after 1380, Walsingham must have been of exceptional age for that period in 1440. \nIt is quite inconceivable that he can have been writing histories after 1461, the virtual close of Henry VI's reign. The \"Acta regis Henrici Sexti\" is therefore probably apocryphal, and Bale and Pits have post-dated Walsingham.\n\nRecent research conjecturally assigns to Walsingham the following six chronicles: \n\nPits remarks in his life of Walsingham that we owe to him the knowledge of many historical incidents not recorded by other writers. He is the principal authority for the reigns of Richard II, Henry IV and Henry V.\nOur acquaintance with John Wycliff's career is largely due to his information, though he was greatly prejudiced against lollardy. \nHe is also the chief authority for the insurrection of Wat Tyler in 1381. \nThe Peasants Revolt of that year was formidable at St. Albans, the abbey being besieged, many of its court rolls and other muniments burnt, and charters of manumission extorted. Walsingham's admiration for Henry V, as the opposer of lollardy, led him to follow with minute detail the progress of that king's campaigns in France.\nWalsingham was a painstaking collector of facts rather than an historian, though he sometimes manipulated his facts with ulterior objects, as is illustrated by the contradictory accounts he gave of the characters of Richard II and John of Gaunt. Tanner mentions a manuscript in the library of St. John's College, Oxford, as attributed to Thomas Walsingham. \nIt is intituled \"De Generatione et Natura Deorum,\" a title which suggests remoteness from Thomas Walsingham's literary pursuits.\n\nWalsingham was no relation to Sir Francis Walsingham, spymaster to Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nA modern edition of Walsingham's Chronica Maiora in: David Preest, \"The\" Chronica Maiora \"of Thomas Walsingham 1376-1422\", with Introduction and Notes by James G.

{"id": "1597904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1597904", "title": "Velasco, Texas", "text": "Velasco, Texas\n\nVelasco was a town in Texas, United States, that was later annexed by the city of Freeport. Founded in 1831, Velasco is situated on the east side of the Brazos River in southeast Texas. It is sixteen miles south of Angleton, Texas, and four miles from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe town's early history is closely tied with the Battle of Velasco and the Texas Revolution. Velasco was an important entry point for American settlers in Texas. In 1836 following the decisive Battle of San Jacinto, Velasco was named a temporary capital of the Republic of Texas by the interim President David G. Burnet. In 1837, the final actions of the Battle of Brazos River occurred there.\n\nVelasco was originally located on the Gulf Coast on the east side of the mouth of the Brazos River where present-day Surfside is located. In 1821, the schooner \"Lively\" landed at the site with thirty-eight men, the first of Stephen F. Austin's colonists. At the time, Texas was part of Mexico, but Austin had obtained permission to bring American settlers into the area, with the first colonists settling in what is now southern Brazoria County.\n\nVelasco consisted of a single house until 1831, when Mexico set up a customs port there and dispatched troops to help the customs collector. More than 25,000 settlers entered through the port. The town was named for a Mexican general, as was Quintana, on the opposite side of the river.\n\nVelasco was the site of the Battle of Velasco in 1832. The battle was fought on June 26, 1832 between Texas colonists and Mexico four years before the Texas Revolution. The Mexican commander during the conflict, Domingo de Ugartechea, tried to stop the Texans from transporting a cannon up the Brazos River to attack the city of Anahuac. The Texans were led by Brazoria Alcade, John Austin, and the schoolteacher and farmer Henry Smith. The Texan militia eventually prevailed over the greatly outnumbered Mexicans. Ugartechea surrendered after a three-day battle, once he realized he would not be receiving reinforcements. His soldiers had also run out of ammunition.\n\nIn 1834, a cholera epidemic reduced the population to 100. After the Battle of San Jacinto, President David G. Burnet made the town the temporary capital of the Republic of Texas. Government records were housed at Fort Velasco until the first capital of Texas was established at Columbia. General Antonio López de Santa Anna signed the Treaties of Velasco on May 14, 1836 acknowledging Texas independence.\n\nBetween the Texas Revolution and the American Civil War, Velasco and Quintana served as summer resorts for wealthy plantation families of the region. The Galveston businessmen Samuel May Williams and Thomas F. McKinney established warehouses and organized shipping at the port. By 1838, a seminary for young ladies, Velasco Female Academy, and a school for young men, taught by Oxford graduates, were established. Comfortable hotels were built to accommodate visitors and patrons of the racetrack, which was located a short distance upriver. A local post office operated from 1846 until 1891, when mail was rerouted through Quintana. Antebellum Velasco had business houses, homes, a hotel, boardinghouses, wharves, and a customhouse. Steamboats embarked from the wharves for Galveston and New Orleans. With completion in 1856 of the first intracoastal canal to Galveston Bay, however, the town began to decline, as much of its shipping was diverted to Galveston.\n\nDuring the U.S. Civil War, the port of Velasco was fortified by Confederate troops and eight gun batteries, and Union ships were forced to go to New Orleans for drinking water, food, and fuel. The port played an active role in the exchange of cotton for European guns, ammunition, milled goods, and medicines for army and home use. Federal vessels attempted to stop vital trade and fired upon shore defenses, patrols, and small craft seeking to outrun them.\n\nWith the ruin of the plantation system after the war, Velasco and Quintana declined as resorts. In 1875 a hurricane destroyed the old town records. By 1884, Old Velasco's residents numbered only fifty.\n\nThe new town of Velasco was surveyed and laid out four miles upriver in 1891, when a new Velasco post office was established. The port was officially opened by the United States Secretary of the Treasury William Windom on July 7, 1891. Over $1,000,000 worth of lots were sold to Midwesterners looking for greener pastures and a seaside environment. By 1892, New Velasco had 136 business establishments and 167 residences, an electric light plant, and a planing mill. Jetties were built by the Brazos River Channel and Dock Company by 1897, and the newly dug deepwater port ran to a depth of 17½ feet.\n\nMuch of Velasco, first owned by John A. and William H. Wharton, was later sold to an agent of the English Rothschild family. They planned to establish a great seaport at the site. By 1896 the community had a new lighthouse, several churches, schools, hotels, a national bank, a cottonseed oil mill, cotton gins, special and general stores, and two weekly newspapers. Old Velasco and Crescent Beach could be reached by electric railroad.\n\nThe population had reached 3,000 when the Galveston hurricane of 1900 wrecked the town. Velasco rebuilt slowly, enduring fluctuations of poverty and prosperity. By 1914, with a population of 1,000 and only one newspaper remaining, the community had a fish and oyster plant and shipped cattle, cotton, cane sugar, and syrup. The population dropped to a low of 400 in the mid-1930s during the Great Depression, when the town supported only 12 businesses.\n\nThe port of Freeport had been built on the Brazos River four miles upstream. The river below the port required frequent dredging in order to accommodate larger ships. In 1929, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers diverted the course of Brazos River three miles west, leaving the four-mile segment of the Old Brazos as a stand-alone ship channel.\n\nDiversion of the Brazos River and the formation of a tidal estuary deep enough to accommodate large vessels in the old river channel subsequently revived both Velasco and nearby Freeport. Construction of chemical-industry facilities during World War II increased available jobs, and the population grew from 900 in 1940, when the city was incorporated with E. F. Roeller as mayor, to 5,200 by 1950.\n\nWith a population estimated at 4,000 in 1956, Velasco was annexed by Freeport on July 27, 1957. The community subsequently became part of the Brazosport industrial and port area and Brazosport Independent School District.\n\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice Clemens Unit is located in an unincorporated area in Brazoria County, near Velasco.\n"}
