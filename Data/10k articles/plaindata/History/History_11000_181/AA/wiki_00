He associated the slaughter of domestic animals, which had been hitherto reared with great care, with the nonchalant belligerence of Western soldiers. In his view, Westerners are free from the kind of hysteria Japanese soldiers would often show at the sight of bloodshed. Aida blamed this hysteria for the excessive acts of cruelty that the Japanese were accused of during the Second World War. Westerners, on the other hand, have so long been accustomed to calmly butchering animals that they developed a rational approach to slaughter, which they extended to human conflict. The Japanese hardly had any contact with livestock owing to the Buddhist taboo of eating meat and were too emotive to master the Western sort of nonchalance.\n\n"}

{"id": "931666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=931666", "title": "Archibald Bower", "text": "Archibald Bower\n\nArchibald Bower (17 January 1686 – 3 September 1766) was a Scottish historian, now noted for his complicated and varying religious faith, and the accounts he gave of it, now considered by scholars to lack credibility.\n\nEducated at the Scots College, Douai, Bower became a Jesuit in Rome. He joined the Church of England a while after returning to London in 1726. He wrote a \"History of the Popes\" (1748–66, 7 volumes). This works was drawn into a damaging controversy, concerning his apparent return to the Jesuit or Catholic fold. By the end of his life it appeared he had changed religion three times.\n\nHe was born on 17 January 1686 at or near Dundee. In 1702 he was sent to the Scots College, Douai; he then went to Rome, and was admitted to the Society of Jesus on 9 December 1706. After a novitiate of two years he went in 1712 to Fano, where he taught classics till 1714, when he moved to Fermo. In 1717 he was recalled to Rome to study divinity in the Roman College, and in 1721 he was transferred to the college of Arezzo, where he remained till 1723, and became reader of philosophy. He was next sent to Florence, and the same year moved on to Macerata, where he stayed till 1726. By then he was, probably, professed of the four vows (his own statements concerning himself may not be reliable).\n\nThe turning-point in Bower's career was his transfer from Macerata to Perugia, and his departure from there to England in 1726. Jesuit records show that the Order sent him to England. Bower gave a quite different story in \"Answer to a Scurrilous Pamphlet\" (1757). Another account had been previously published by Richard Baron in 1750, allegedly based on the story Bower gave of his \"escape\" to Dr. Hill, chaplain to the archbishop of Canterbury. A third account is printed at the end of \"Bower and Tillemont compared\" (1757) by Douglas.\n\nOn his arrival in England in June or July 1726 Bower became acquainted with Edward Aspinwall, formerly a Jesuit, who introduced him to Samuel Clarke. After several meetings with Aspinwall, Clarke, and George Berkeley, he withdrew from the communion of the Roman Catholic church, and left the Society of Jesus. He wrote that he was then for six years a Protestant of no particular denomination, before l he conformed to the church of England. In fact he was making tentative contact again with the Jesuits, in the early 1630s.\n\nThrough the royal physician Thomas Goodman, Bower obtained a recommendation to Lord Aylmer, who wanted a classical tutor. He was for several years on close terms with Aylmer, and was introduced to connections including George Lyttelton, who became a loyal friend. He took on a tutoring post, the education of the son of a Mr. Thompson, of Cooley, Berkshire; he switched after a year to Aylmer's household.\n\nBower was reconciled to the Catholic church in 1744 by the Jesuit Philip Carterest. This reconversion was preceded by negotiations of over a decade, and financial arrangements. Bower, however, soon again grew dissatisfied with his situation. He began a correspondence with Father Sheldon, the Jesuit provincial; and he received back his invested funds on 20 June 1747.\n\nOn the death of Francis Say, keeper of Queen Caroline of Ansbach's library (10 September 1748), Bower obtained the place through the interest of Lyttelton with the prime minister Henry Pelham. The next year (4 August 1749) he married a niece of Bishop William Nicolson, a daughter of a clergyman of the church of England. This lady had a fortune, and a child by a former husband. He had already been engaged in a treaty of marriage, which did not take effect, in 1745. In April 1754 Lyttelton appointed him clerk of the buck-warrants.\n\nBower died on 3 September 1766, and was buried in Marylebone churchyard. The epitaph on his tomb describes him as \"a man exemplary for every social virtue, justly esteemed by all who knew him for his strict honesty and integrity, a faithful friend, and a sincere christian\". He bequeathed all his property to his wife, who attested that he died a Protestant (\"London Chronicle\", 11 October 1766).\n\nWhile he resided with Lord Aylmer, Bower wrote \"Historia Literaria\", a monthly review that appeared from 1730 to 1734. During the following nine years (1735–1744) he was employed on the \"Universal History\", to which he contributed the history of Rome. He was paid to revise its second edition.\n\nOn 25 March 1747 Bower issued proposals for printing by subscription his \"History of the Popes\". He explained that researches designed to vindicate papal supremacy had had the opposite effect on him. He presented the first volume to the king 13 May 1748. The second volume appeared in 1751, and towards the end of 1753 the third volume, which brought down his history to the death of Pope Stephen II in 757. It was in 1754 that the first serious attack was made on the work, in a pamphlet by Alban Butler, published anonymously at Douai as \"Remarks on the two first volumes of the late Lives of the Popes; in letters from a Gentleman to a Friend in the Country.\"\n\nA controversial storm then broke over Bower. Letters addressed by Bower to the provincial of the Jesuits fell into the hands of Sir Henry Bedingfield, who asserted that they showed Bower was a Catholic. Bower maintained that these letters were forgeries, by the Jesuits. Then John Douglas published in 1756 a pamphlet supporting the genuineness of the letters; and testimony of a Mrs. Hoyles whom Bower had converted. There was a reply from Bower's side, and Douglas published a second tract, \"Bower and Tillemont compared\" (1757), in which he argued that the \"History of the Popes\", especially the first volume, was in effect a translation of the work of Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont. In 1757 Bower brought out three long pamphlets, and Douglas followed with \"A Full Confutation of all the Facts advanced in Mr. Bower's Three Defences\" (1757), and \"A Complete and Final Detection of A——d B——r\" (1758), with documentation from Italy, and arguing that Bower was an imposter.\n\nDavid Garrick, once a friend of Bower, threatened to write a farce in which Bower was to be introduced on the stage as a mock convert. Bower replied with personal attacks and rebuttals. Before the controversy had ended he published his fourth volume, and in 1757 an abridgment of the first four volumes of his work was published in French at Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1761 Bower seems to have had a hand in the anonymous \"Authentic Memoirs concerning the Portuguese Inquisition, in a series of letters to a friend\". Around the same time he produced the fifth volume of his \"History of the Popes\", with a summary his deakins with Catholics. The rest of his history did not appear till just before the author's death, when the sixth and seventh volumes were published together; but with the period from 1600 to 1758 covered in 26 pages. The \"History of the Popes\" was reprinted with a continuation by Samuel Hanson Cox, in 3 vols., Philadelphia, 1844-5.\n"}

{"id": "666938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=666938", "title": "Battle of Roncevaux Pass", "text": "Battle of Roncevaux Pass\n\nThe Battle of Roncevaux Pass (French and English spelling, \"Roncesvalles\" in Spanish, \"Orreaga\" in Basque) in 778 saw a large force of Basques ambush a part of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux Pass, a high mountain pass in the Pyrenees on the present border between France and Spain, after his invasion of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe Basque attack was a retaliation for Charlemagne's destruction of the city walls of their capital, Pamplona. As the Franks retreated across the Pyrenees back to Francia, the rearguard of Frankish lords was cut off, stood its ground, and was wiped out. Roncevaux was Charlemagne's only military defeat.\n\nAmong those killed in the battle was a relatively obscure Frankish commander, Roland, whose death elevated him and the paladins, the foremost warriors of Charlemagne's court, into legend, becoming the quintessential role model for knights and also greatly influencing the code of chivalry in the Middle Ages. There are numerous written works about the battle, some of which change and exaggerate events. The battle is recounted in the 11th century \"The Song of Roland\", the oldest surviving major work of French literature, and in \"Orlando Furioso\", one of the most celebrated works of Italian literature. Modern adaptations of the battle include books, plays and works of fiction, and monuments in the Pyrenees.\n\nWith the rise of the Carolingians and Pepin the Short's war on Aquitaine, the Duchy of Aquitaine led by Waifer was defeated and further ensued Frankish penetration into the duchy. The Basques (\"Vascones\", \"Wascones\") of the Duchy of Vasconia, one of the mainstays of the Aquitanian army, submitted to Pepin in 766 and 769, but the territory south of the Garonne remained largely unscathed and self-governed. However, as of 778 Charlemagne expanded Frankish takeover of Aquitaine to present-day Gascony, by appointing trusted Franks, Burgundians and Church officials in key regional positions and establishing counties, such as Fezensac, Bordeaux, and Toulouse, on the left bank of the Garonne.\n\nSulayman al-Arabi, the pro-Abbasid Wali (governor) of Barcelona and Girona, sent a delegation to Charlemagne in Paderborn, offering his submission, along with the allegiance of Husayn of Zaragoza and Abu Taur of Huesca in return for military aid. Their masters had been cornered in the Iberian peninsula by Abd ar-Rahman I, the Umayyad emir of Córdoba. The three rulers also conveyed that the caliph of Baghdad, Muhammad al-Mahdi, was preparing an invasion force against Abd ar-Rahman.\n\nSeeing an opportunity to extend Christendom and his own power, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain. Al-Arabi induced him to invade al Andalus by promising him an easy surrender of its Upper March, of which Zaragoza was the capital. Following the sealing of this alliance at Paderborn, Charlemagne marched across the Pyrenees in 778 \"at the head of all the forces he could muster\". Charlemagne led the Neustrian army over Vasconia into the Western Pyrenees, while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees through Catalonia. His troops were welcomed in Barcelona and Girona by Sulayman al-Arabi. As he moved towards Zaragoza, the troops of Charlemagne were joined by troops led by al-Arabi, before eventually putting the city in a siege.\n\nAbd ar-Rahman of Córdoba sent his most trusted general, Thalaba Ibn Obeid, to take control of the possibly rebellious city and to prevent the Frankish invasion. Husayn and Ibn Obeid clashed repeatedly; eventually Husayn managed to defeat and to imprison Ibn Obeid. Reinforced in his autonomous position, Husayn became reluctant to yield his new privileged status to the Frankish monarch and refused to surrender the city to Charlemagne, claiming that he had never promised Charlemagne his allegiance. He seems to have tried to appease Charlemagne by giving him the prisoner General Ibn Obeid and a large tribute of gold, but Charlemagne was not easily satisfied, putting Sulayman al-Arabi in chains. Meanwhile, the force sent by the Baghdad caliphate seems to have been stopped near Barcelona. Though initially having the upper hand, the siege of Zaragoza dragged for over a month. Eventually a deal was struck between Charlemagne and Husayn. The latter would pay gold and the release of several prisoners, while the Franks in return would withdraw their siege.\n\nBefore leaving the Iberian peninsula he decided to further secure his hold on the Basque territory (Wasconia). Charlemagne first eliminated any possible opposition from the natives of the region (the Basque tribes), believing that many of them were allied with the Moors. He gave orders to tear down the walls of the Basque capital Pamplona, possibly fearing that it could be used for future conflicts. Some primary sources suggest that he destroyed the city altogether, and many towns in the region were also razed. Garrisons and military outposts were placed throughout the territory, and there were accounts of the Franks' harsh treatment of the Basques during their occupation. After securing the region, Charlemagne marched for the Pyrenees mountain pass in hopes of returning to France. Many of his notable lords, such as Roland, military governor of the Breton March, and Eggihard, Mayor of the Palace, were placed in the rearguard probably to protect the retreat and the baggage train. Unknown to Charlemagne, the enraged Basques sent their warriors in pursuit of him and his army in retaliation for the destruction of their city, and the Basques' knowledge of the region helped them overtake the Franks.\n\nIn the evening of August 15, 778, Charlemagne's rearguard was suddenly attacked by the Basques as they crossed the mountain pass. The Franks were caught off guard by the surprise attack, with their army in confusion and disarray as they tried to escape the ambush. The Basques managed to cut off and isolate the Frankish rearguard and the baggage train from the rest of the escaping army, and although the Basques were not as well equipped, they held the upper ground and the knowledge of the terrain that gave them a huge advantage in the skirmish. As Charlemagne tried to regroup and evacuate his army, Roland and the others held for a considerable amount of time, before the Basques finally massacred them completely. Though killed to the last man, the rearguard nonetheless succeeded in allowing Charlemagne and his army to continue to safety. The Basques then looted the baggage that was left behind and took advantage of the darkness to flee, leaving no trace for the Franks to follow in the following morning. The revised version of the \"Annales Regni\" reads:\n\nOne of the principal units of the Vascones was the guerrilla army of the Basques. A later source, the anonymous \"Saxon Poet\", talks of the Basque spears, agreeing with the Pyrenean and Basque tradition much later among the almogavars. A typical Basque mountain warrior was armed with two short spears and a knife or short sword as his main weapons, and bows or javelins for missile weapons. He would not normally wear armour. Pierre de Marca, a Béarnese author, suggests that the attackers were a reduced number of mostly local Low Navarrese, Souletines, and Baztanese, whose main motivation may have been plunder. The Vascones have a history of resisting Carolingian rule since the incursion of Frankish king Pepin the Short, which saw the defeat of Waiofar, the last independent Duke of Aquitaine.\n\nThe accounts of Einhard and Pierre de Marca suggest that the perpetrator of the attack was Lupo II of Gascony. He held the territory of the Pyrenees, making him responsible for the tragedy that happened in his realm. Regions surrounding his kingdom such as Bordeaux were under the control of the Carolingians. While the Duke did pay homage to Charlemagne by offering Hunald II (a rebel leader and a possible heir to Waiofar) and his wife to him, there were disputes over the trans-Pyrenean Basques lands ruled by Lupo and those under Carolingian suzerainty. The authors of the General History of Languedoc also believed in the same theory that the Duke was the leader of the attack. Their reasons were that he and the Vascones opposed Carolingian expansion into Vasconia after the Franco-Aquitanian war (760–769).\n\nThe Pyrenees are a mountain range in southwest Europe that form a natural border between France and Spain, extending about 490 km (305 m) from Cap Higuer on the Bay of Biscay, to Cap de Creus on the Mediterranean Sea. The range also separates the Iberian Peninsula from the rest of Western Europe. Beyond the Northern part of the pass lies much of the French frontier and wilderness. The mountains are older than the Alps and have an elevation of 1,777 m (3,862 feet). These descriptions have suggested various places from which the battle could have taken place, ranging from Navarre and Aragon to as far as Catalonia.\n\nThe mainstream opinion is that the battle took place somewhere not far from Roncevaux itself, as it is not just on one of the easiest routes but also the traditional one. Indeed, the Roman road \"Via ab Asturica Burdigalam\" which started in Castra Legiones (current León) and went to Benearnum, crossed the Pyrenees through Roncevaux. However, the traditional Roman road (also called the \"Route of Napoleon\") followed a route different from the modern one, not crossing at Ibañeta (the traditional location) but heading up eastwards and crossing instead the Lepoeder and Bentartea passes—next to the mount Astobizkar—not far from the mount Urkulu, identified as the \"Summum Pyreneum\" of the classic Roman sources.\n\nCharlemagne biographer Einhard stated that the men in the rear were \"massacred to the last man.\" The \"Vita Karoli\" mentions the names of the most important lords killed such as Eggihard, Roland and Anselmus; the Palatine Count. The battle caused numerous losses among the Frankish troops, including several of the most important aristocrats and the sack of the baggage, probably with all the gold given by the Muslims at Zaragoza.\n\nWhile the skirmish was a small setback, Charlemagne did lose huge quantities of treasure and good men. It was the only significant defeat that Charlemagne ever suffered in his otherwise successful military career. Never again would Charlemagne take it upon himself to lead an army to battle in Spain, having to rely instead on his generals for future campaigns in the Iberian Peninsula. The Franks failed to capture Zaragoza and suffered a significant loss at the hands of the Vascones, but Charlemagne would return to establish the Marca Hispanica, to serve as a buffer region between his Christian empire and the Muslims to the south. A decade later the Franks finally captured Barcelona. He would also later establish the Kingdom of Aquitaine with the son of Louis the Pious as its first king. Land in the Pyrenees would be directed upon by Carolingian officials, and distributed among colonisers and to the Spanish Church who were allied to Charlemagne. A Christianization program was put in place across the high Pyrenees. The Basque would continue their rebellion to Carolingian rule until the appointment of William of Orange, who would dissolve their rebellion after capturing and exiling Lupo's son and Basque leader Adalric in 790.\n\nZaragoza, however, remained a Muslim city and capital of the Upper March, and later of an independent emirate until the 11th century. Pamplona, itself, would still remain in the hands of the Muslims and held until a rebellion in 798–801 expelled them as well. The Vascones would finally consolidate the Banu Qasi realm and eventually the constitution of the independent Kingdom of Pamplona in 824 after the birth of a new resistance to Carolingian rule. In that same year, the Basque army defeated another Carolingian army in the same mountain pass. The second Battle of Roncevaux Pass was almost similar to the first, with the Basques again taking advantage of the terrain, but against a much larger Frankish force. Unlike the first battle in which Charlemagne's army managed to escape, the Carolingians led by Count Aeblus were trapped and routed, and a larger number of men were slaughtered than those of Charlemagne's. Frankish vassals Aeblus and Aznar were captured by the joint forces of Iñigo Arista's Pamplona and of the Banu Qasi, consolidating the independence of both realms.\n\nOver the years, this battle was romanticized by oral tradition into a major conflict between Christians and Muslims although in fact, the Basques of the period were mainly Pagans and Charlemagne had been allied to some of the Muslims. In the tradition, the Basques are replaced by a force of 400,000 Saracens, and mythical objects such as durendal and oliphant were also added. Although Roland died in the battle with little information about him, the battle popularized him as a chivalric hero of honor in the Middle Ages. \"The Song of Roland\", which commemorates the battle, was written by an unknown poet of the 11th century. It is the earliest surviving of the \"chansons de geste\" or epic poems of medieval France in the \"langue d'oïl\", in what would become the French language. Together with the Knights of the Round Table in Britain, the story of Roland and the paladins have become the archetypal icons of chivalry in Europe; greatly influencing knightly culture and inspiring many Christian warriors that came after. During the Battle of Hastings in 1066, knights and soldiers under William the Conqueror, chanted the poem to inspire themselves before their fight with the Anglo-Saxons. The English expression, \"to give a Roland for an Oliver\", meaning either to offer a \"quid pro quo\" or to give as good as one gets, which is referenced directly from the companionship of Roland and Oliver during the battle. One example was said during the Combat of the Thirty in 1351; a judicial combat between two groups of knights during the Breton War of Succession. The knights were described by the French author Jean Froissart as \"if they had been all Rolands and Olivers,\" which admired their honor and companionship in battle. Memorials have also been erected to commemorate the battle, such as the Roncesvalles Pass Monument in Navarre, Spain. Roland's Breach, situated in the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, is a gap thought to have been caused by Roland while fighting. At the summit of the Roncevaux Pass are the remains of an early chapel of San Salvador also known as Charlemagne's Chapel and the Charlemagne Monument built in 1934; both built to commemorate the Emperor's campaign in the region.\n\nThe song is also commemorated in the Italian literary classic \"Orlando Furioso\". The battle is also referenced in the song \"Roncevaux\" by Van der Graaf Generator, originally recorded in 1972 but only released in rather rough form many years later on the album \"Time Vaults\". The battle and Orlando's sacrifice inspired several composers, amongst whom were Claudio Monteverdi, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Antonio Vivaldi and George Frideric Handel, who composed an Italian-language opera with \"Orlando\". Modern adaptations of the battle drew heavily on the romanticized versions. A 1978 French film \"La chanson de Roland\" features an adaptation of the \"Song of Roland\" and features the battle as depicted in the poem. The battle is also featured minimally in the graphic novel \"\", in which Roland is named Orlando, an amalgamation of fictional characters that were named Roland and Orlando.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24737614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24737614", "title": "Canteen Kopje", "text": "Canteen Kopje\n\nCanteen Kopje is an archaeological site, formally protected as a grade 2 provincial heritage site, and approved in 2017 for re-grading to national status, situated outside Barkly West in the Northern Cape, South Africa. The place was previously known as Klipdrift, meaning stony drift, a translation from a still earlier !Ora name, !\"a\" |\"aub\". Canteen Kopje is best known for its long and exceptionally rich Earlier Stone Age sequence, spanning circa >0.5 to 1.7 million years, occurring within gravels exposed in late nineteenth/early twentieth century mining pits. Also attracting attention are more recent archaeological levels in the overlying Hutton Sands, which contain material known as Fauresmith, Middle Stone Age, Later Stone Age, and late Iron Age with evidence of protocolonial/colonial contact and interaction, probably, with nineteenth century diamond diggers. \nThe importance of Canteen Kopje as a heritage site was recognized, and a 9 hectare area known as Erf 91 was proclaimed as a protected reserve in 1948. Gideon Retief, Mining Commissioner of Barkly West from 1942 to 1951, was instrumental in preserving the site and creating the first open air exhibit here. Subsequently, in 2000, information panels were erected by the McGregor Museum. These were refurbished in 2016. A walking trail was laid out for visitors to view the early diamond diggings and archaeological research sites. The Barkly West Museum contains further information and examples of artefacts from the site, while material excavated by archaeologists is housed principally by the McGregor Museum, the approved archaeological repository for the Northern Cape Province in nearby Kimberley.\n\nIn 2016 the protected heritage site was directly threatened after the Department of Minerals and Energy issued a permit for part of the site to be mined. Although a heritage permit had not been issued by the South African Heritage Resources Agency, mining commenced on 18 March 2016. An urgent interdicted was granted by the Northern Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa on 19 March, being made final on 19 April 2016.\n\nIn the 1940s the archaeologist C. van Riet Lowe predicted: “When the last diamond claim has been abandoned, archaeologists throughout the world will be interested in Canteen Kopje, in the Vaal River diggings, where lie the prehistoric remains of a million years of human evolution.”\n\nOne of the hills in the vicinity of Canteen Kopje was the site of the first alluvial diamond diggings (as opposed to surface prospecting) on the Diamond Fields of South Africa, which precipitated the rush to these parts in 1870. Digging continued here until the early 1940s.\n\nBatlhaping \"Kgosi\" (Chief) Jantjie Mothibi controlled, for as long as he could, the influx of white “diamond seekers” to the region. Prospectors were allowed to use sharp sticks, but were not permitted to “touch the ground with pick and shovel”. For their part, as noted by Jerome Babe in his 1872 book, \"The South African Diamond Fields\", “Natives would form themselves in long lines, joined hand in hand, and walk slowly over the ground and look for diamonds, especially after rain; and if they found one they would take it to a trader...[Finds were exchanged for] horses, wagons, cows, sheep, cash, goods, etc at a deuce of a pace”.\n\nIn January 1870 diggers from KwaZulu-Natal were working their way along the Vaal River, finding diamonds at Klipdrift, on the “Old Koppie”, upslope from Canteen Kopje. Using “pick and shovel, in spite of the natives”, they unearthed more, precipitating the diamond rush. Soon both banks of the Vaal River were thronging with diggers of many nationalities, and by the end of the year there were five thousand people at Klipdrift alone.\n\nThe diggers formed a Mutual Protection Association and elected Stafford Parker as their leader. Klipdrift was renamed Parkerton (from 1873 it was called Barkly West), and a Diggers’ Republic was proclaimed in July 1870.\n\nA popular early cradle sieve for recovery of diamonds was the so-called “Long Tom”, which was reliant on large quantities of water. An improved version less dependent on water was developed by the American digger, author of \"The South African Diamond Fields\", Jerome Babe. His ‘dry sifter’, known as the “Yankee Baby”, is still used in the twenty first century by some small-scale diggers. At the time, its inventor was said to be “the first Babe to rock his own cradle”.\n\nThe centrifugal or rotary washing machine – now standard on diggings in the area – is more sophisticated. In a slurry, a concentrate of heavy diamond-bearing deposit is separated from lighter waste.\n\nDiggers staked their claims near the river, and dug the gravel where it was exposed at or near the surface. Where the gravel was buried deeper under silt and sand - such as at Canteen Kopje - large pits were dug. From these and from vertical shafts, the diggers tunnelled out precarious passageways in which a man could hardly stand.\n\nThe sequence of geological deposits in the vicinity of Canteen Kopje comprises:\n\n\nDiamonds at or near Canteen Kopje are confined to the Older and Younger Gravels. Around 90-120 million years ago, a swarm of volcanic pipes, centred on Kimberley to the east, brought diamond-bearing kimberlite to a higher surface formed of Karoo Sequence sediments. Subsequent erosion has lowered the entire regional landscape by over 1200 metres and in the process the diamonds were released from their host rock. It has been estimated that at least 50 million carats of diamonds were set free in this way from the five kimberlite pipes in the vicinity of Kimberley alone. Most of those were flushed away to the sea long ago in past and present river channels, but along the way some were trapped in alluvial deposits such as the Older and Younger Gravels along rivers in this region.\n\nEarlier Stone Age artefacts were noted in the area by Colonel James Henry Bowker and Mary Elizabeth Barber at the time of the earliest diamond diggings. Eminent prehistorians including C. van Riet Lowe, the French prehistorian, the Abbé Henri Breuil and J. Desmond Clark visited and described it. Breuil was here in 1929 and again in the 1940s, when he famously noted that \"not only are there enough specimens [there] to fill a museum to overflowing but to build it of them also.\"\n\nOn account both of the mining history as well as the finding of Acheulean artefacts at this spot, a 10 morgen portion of Canteen Kopje was declared a National Monument (since 2000 known as a provincial heritage site) in 1948. Mining recommenced in the vicinity in the 1990s and Canteen Kopje was nearly lost. Pressure was exerted for the site to be de-proclaimed as a heritage site, to allow for renewed diamond digging and ‘empowerment’ of small scale miners. The local community recognised the value of conserving heritage and supported the efforts of the then National Monuments Council and the McGregor Museum to preserve the site, which was then developed as an open-air museum. The new Barkly West Museum was created at the same time.\n\nRenewed threat was experienced in 2016. In 2014 the Department of Minerals (DMR) issued a permit for mining to take place on part of the declared site. The South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA) was alerted and in response, because of the existing formal declaration, a Cease Works Order was put in place to prevent mining from taking place. Pressure was exerted however and in March 2016 the Cease Works Order was lifted, following which, on 16 March 2016, a diamond mining operation commenced work by fencing off an area around that for which they have a DMR mining permit. Public access to the remainder of the heritage site was blocked. Section 27(18) of the National Heritage Resources Act (NHRA) (Act 25 of 1999) states that: \"No person may destroy, damage, deface, excavate, alter, remove from its original position, subdivide or change the planning status of any heritage site without a permit issued by the heritage resources authority responsible for the protection of such site.\" Section 51. (1) of the NHRA states that: \"Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any person who contravenes— (a) sections 27(18), 29(10), 32(13) or 32(19) is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine or imprisonment or both such fine and imprisonment as set out in item 1 of the Schedule.\" Since the mining concern has commenced mining operations without such a permit issued by SAHRA, it is clearly in contravention of an Act of the Republic of South Africa and therefore is guilty of an offence.\n\nExcavations in the late 1990s were carried out by Peter Beaumont of the McGregor Museum. John McNabb from the University of Southampton worked with Beaumont in analysing the Acheulean stone artefact technology. Further excavations have been carried out by archaeologists from the University of the Witwatersrand (inter alia for application of cosmogenic nuclide burial dating) and the University of Toronto. The current active programme of research has yielded an as yet unpublished basal date of some 2.3 million years, while excavations involving students from the Sol Plaatje University in Kimberley investigate the most recent circa 19th century contact period archaeology showing interaction between local communities and colonial diggers.\n\nCrucial to the interpretation of the archaeology of the site, is an understanding of site formation in relation to the adjacent hill and the Vaal River which at different periods cut down first to the north of the site and then the south west.\n\nIn 2007-9 a 7-metre sequence through Hutton Sands and Gravels was excavated to carry out dating and a detailed analysis of the lithic profile. There is a marked 'Victoria West' Acheulean horizon (named for the town in the Karoo where these stone tools were first described) in the upper part of the gravels, subject to a current Southampton PhD project. The lower part of the sequence contains simpler, older Acheulean technology.\n\nLater Stone Age material at and just below the surface has been studied in two excavations by archaeologists from the University of the Witwatersrand and Toronto.\n\nThe Canteen Kopje Skull was found in the vicinity in 1925 by diamond digger Kenneth Kemp, working 2.4 m down at an unrecorded locality at Canteen Kopje. A number of fitting skull fragments were presented by Kemp to the magistrate J.G. van Alphen, who in turn donated them to the McGregor Museum. They were studied soon afterwards by Robert Broom, who described it in \"Nature\" in 1929.\n\nIn Broom’s reconstruction, the skull appeared to have features similar to an allegedly archaic skeleton found at Boskop near Johannesburg. In 2011-12 X-ray Computerised Tomography scans of the skull, carried out at the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation near Pretoria, suggested it falls within the range of variation of Khoe-San populations of the Holocene (last 12 000 years), and is not ‘archaic’ as Broom had suggested. Reconsideration of the evidence also points to it having come from the Hutton Sands and not the Younger Gravels, as previously presumed.\n\n"}
{"id": "2851904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2851904", "title": "Detlev Peukert", "text": "Detlev Peukert\n\nDetlev Peukert (September 20, 1950 in Gütersloh – May 17, 1990 in Hamburg) was a German historian, noted for his studies of the relationship between what he called the \"spirit of science\" and the Holocaust and in social history and the Weimar Republic. Peukert taught modern history at the University of Essen and served as director of the Research Institute for the History of the Nazi Period. Peukert was a member of the German Communist Party until 1978, when he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. A politically engaged historian, Peukert was known for his unconventional take on modern German history, and in an obituary, the British historian Richard Bessel wrote that it was a major loss that Peukert had died at the age of 39 as a result of AIDS.\n\nPeukert was born in a working-class family in the Ruhr, his father a coal miner and his mother a housewife, and he was the first member of his family to attend university. Many of his father's fellow coal miners had been members of either the SPD or KPD, and were sent to concentration camps during the Nazi era. Growing up in the coal miners' milieu, where many so had been sent to concentration camps for anti-Nazi views, left Peukert very interested in the subject of outsiders in the Third Reich, as he wanted to know why so many coal miners chose to oppose the Nazi regime when so many other ordinary people were passive, indifferent or supportive of the Nazi regime. The coal miners of the Ruhr formed a distinctive sub-culture in Germany, known for their defiant, rebellious attitude to authority, left-wing views, and their often confrontational relations with the firm of Krupp AG, Germany's biggest corporation, which in turn was owned by the Krupp family, Germany's richest family. As a student, Peukert studied under Hans Mommsen at Bochum university, and began teaching at the University of Essen starting in 1978.\n\nAs a \"68er\" whose politics were defined by the student protests of 1968, Peukert was active in left-wing politics and joined the German Communist Party. The historian Michael Zimmerman who knew Peukert as an undergraduate in the early 1970s described Peukert as active in the student federation MSP Spartakus and the DKP, but described him as a committed Communist who grew disillusioned following the expulsions of Rudolf Bahro and Wolf Biermann together with the \"freeze\" on discussing Euro-communism within the party following orders from East Germany. Peukert's writings on German Communist resistance in Nazi Germany differed greatly from the party line laid down in East Germany that the entire German working class under the KPD had opposed the Nazi regime, and ultimately led to him leaving the Communist Party in 1978 to join the Social Democratic party. The DKP was secretly subsidized by East Germany and as a result, the party was slavishly loyal to its East German paymasters. Peukert during his time in the Communist party had come to find the party line on history was too dogmatic and rigid as he kept finding the facts of history were more complex and nuanced than the version of history laid by the party line. Peukert's work was criticized within Communist circles for his willingness to be critical of the decisions of the underground KPD in Nazi Germany, and his sensitivity to \"human frailty\" as he examined working class life in the Third Reich, writing that not everybody wanted to be a hero and die for their beliefs.\n\nPeukert's first book was his 1976 book \"Ruhrarbeiter gegen den Faschismus\" (\"Ruhr Workers Against Fascism\"), a study of anti-Nazi activities among the working class of the Ruhr during the Third Reich. Reflecting his left-wing views, Peukert praised \"our red grandfathers\" who chose to oppose National Socialism, despite their downtrodden status, arguing that their willingness to take action when so many were passive or supportive of National Socialism, made them heroes. Peukert's PhD thesis, published in 1980, was \"Die KPD im Widerstand Verfolgung und Untergrundarbeit am Rhein und Ruhr, 1933-1945\" (\"The KPD in the Resistance Persecution and Underground work in the Rhine and the Ruhr 1933-1945\"). Peukert's work went beyond what the title of his PhD dissertation would suggest, as he examined the ideological motivation, organizational structure of the underground Communist Party, and the motivation and social background of a single individual Communist in the Ruhr and Rhineland convicted by German courts of belonging to the KPD. Peukert's work on the Communist resistance led him to engage in many bitter, polemical disputes with his former associates in the Communist Party who did not like his conclusions.\n\nFrom the right, criticism of \"Die KPD im Widerstand Verfolgung und Untergrundarbeit am Rhein und Ruhr, 1933-1945\" came from the American historian Albert Lindemann who complained that Peukert's focus on Communist resistance in the Rhineland and Ruhr regions did not merit a 460-page long book, through Lindemann wrote that wrote the book was not \"an exercise in hagiography\" and praised Peukert for his \"critical remarks\" about East German historiography. On the broader subject of Communism, Lindemann wrote that Peukert's book was flawed by what the reviewer considered his moral blind spot, writing that for Peukert fascism was \"a convenient absolute evil; anti-fascism, however flawed in its particulars is thus in some ultimate sense heroic\". Lindemann wrote that \"the author [Peukert] appears to consider it absurd to suggest the KPD and the NSDAP morally resembled each other. Yet Stalinism in the 1930s was at least as brutish in form as Hitlerlism and was responsible, at least until 1939, for many more deaths, indeed for organized murder on an unparalleled scale. The KPD enthusiastically associated itself with the nightmarish inhumanities of Stalin's rule\". Lindemann ended his review that Peukert's approach in considering Communist resistance in Nazi Germany to be \"heroic\" was wrong as the subject of \"Communist heroism\" in Nazi Germany was more morally nuanced than what Peukert would consider.\n\nPeukert was a leading expert in \"Alltagsgeschichte\" (\"history of everyday life\") and his work often examined the effect of Nazi social policies on ordinary Germans and on persecuted groups such as Jews and Roma. The subject of \"Alltagsgeschichte\" had first been established as a subect in the 1970s, and had first attracted attention when Martin Broszat and his protégés launched the \"Bavaria project\" in 1973, intended to document everyday life in Bavaria in the Third Reich. Broszat had begun the study of \"Alltagsgeschichte\" in the early 1970s with two goals. The first was to counter what Broszat considered to be the excessively \"from above\" high politics approach to writing about Nazi Germany which largely saw the story of the Third Reich by looking at the actions of Hitler and the rest of the Nazi elite and treating almost everybody else in Germany as merely passive objects controlled and manipulated by the state. Broszat wanted to treat the German people as subjects in their own lives during the Nazi era, making choices in their everyday lives, both for good and ill, albeit within a reduced range. The second goal of Broszat with \"Alltagsgeschichte\" was to end the \"monumentalization\" of the men involved in the July 20 \"putsch\" in 1944, with Broszat complaining treated the story of resistance in Nazi Germany as one of few conservatives from the traditional elites in the aristocracy, the military, the bureaucracy, and the diplomatic corps struggling to overthrow the Nazi regime. Broszat wished to examine resistance by ordinary people at least in part to show there was resistance other than those involved in the 20 July \"putsch\" attempt.\n\nPeukert admitted to being influenced by Broszat's work with the \"Bavaria Project\", but he gave another reason for becoming interested in \"alltagsgeschichte\" in 1979. In January 1979, the 1978 American TV mini-series \"Holocaust\" was shown in West Germany and caused a sensation, being watched by 50% of West Germans. The airing of \"Holocaust\" first time that many Germans born after 1945 had learned about the Holocaust, which was something of a taboo subject for the first decades after 1945. Writing in 1981, Peukert wrote: \"Looking back, people's own everyday experience seemed to have been so different that they could not find themselves in the picture which historians painted, because in their remembrance the everyday life situation was often viewed positively. Even for those who strove for a critical coming to terms [\"Bewältigung\"] with their experience of repression, of yielding to the temptations of the regime and of involvement with criminal inhumanity, even they often remained at loss about how to build a bridge from their own experience to the contemporary historical critical state of knowledge\". In the early 1980s, Peukert began teaching \"Alltagsgeschichte\", until then a subject mostly ignored by German historians before the 1970s, as he argued that the subject was important. Peukert wanted to explore why so many ordinary Germans who lived through the Nazi era remembered it as a time of \"normality\" and often in a very positive way while at the same time genocide was taking place. Peukert argued there was a disconnect between the popular image today of the Nazi era as a time of unparalleled horror vs. the way in which most ordinary Germans remembered it as a time of benign \"normality\", and that studying \"Alltagsgeschichte\" would explore what the Third Reich was actually like in \"everyday life\". In the early 1980s, \"Alltagsgeschichte\" exploded in popularity in West Germany with numerous work groups being set, usually by left-wing groups, to explore the history of their home towns in the Nazi era. The study of \"Alltagsgeschichte\" was greatly influenced by the History Workshop movement in Britain set up by the Marxist historian E.P. Thompson and like the British Workshop groups, many involved in the \"Alltagsgeschichte\" study groups were not historians with a disproportional number of the volunteers being high-school students. The American historian Mary Nolan wrote with some envy about the way in which thousands of German high school students became involved in the \"Alltagsgeschichte\" study groups, observing that it was simply inconceivable that thousands of American high school students would join study groups to research the histories of their home towns in the 1930s-1940s as most Americans have no interest in history. In 1984, Peukert was awarded the annual culture prize given by the city of Essen for his work with a history workshop group in Essen.\n\nA historian with a very strong work ethic, Peukert believed that history \"belonged to everybody\", not just the historians, and was very energetic in attempting to break down barriers to interest the public in history by settling up exhibitions about \"Alltagsgeschichte\" in the Third Reich. In 1980, Peukert planned the historical exhibition at the Old Synagogue of Essen on the subject \"Resistance and Persecution in Essen 1933-1945\". In 1984, Peukert won the Maeier-Leibnitz prize for his habilitation on youth policy in Germany in late 19th and early 20th centuries. Moving beyond the subject of resistance (\"Widerstand\"), Peukert became interested in \"oppositionality\" (\"Widerständigkeit\") in everyday life in Nazi Germany. Peukert was especially interested in the Edelweiss Pirates, a group of working class teenagers in Cologne and the other cities of the Rhineland who formed a distinctive anti-Nazi subculture, and who often fought the Hitler Youth. Another related area of interest for Peukert was resistance, opposition and dissent in the Third Reich. Peukert developed a pyramid model starting with \"nonconformity\" (behavior in private that featured partial rejection of the Nazi regime) running to \"refusal of co-operation\" (\"Verweigerung\") to \"protest\", and finally to \"Widerstand\" (resistance), which involved total rejection of the Nazi regime.\n\nIn particular, Peukert looked at how in \"everyday life\" in Nazi Germany, aspects of both \"normality\" and \"criminality\" co-existed with another. For Peukert, to examine resistance and opposition in \"Alltagsgeschichte\" with no reference to the broader society led the historian no-where, and to resolve this problem he wrote his 1982 book \"Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde\" (\"National Comrades and Community Aliens\"), which was translated into English as \"Inside Nazi Germany\" in 1987. The book's title was taken from the two legal categories which the entire population of Germany was divided into during the Nazi era; the \"Volksgenossen\" (National Comrades) who were the people who belonged to the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" and the \"gemeinschaftsfremde\" (Community Aliens) who did not. In \"Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde\", Peukert looked at the experience of \"everyday life\" in Nazi Germany in its totality, examining both conformity and resistance equally to examine how all Germans, not just those in sub-cultures like the Edelweiss Pirates or the Ruhr miners had behaved.\n\nPeukert also sought to critically explore why so many ordinary Germans remembered the Third Reich as a time of blissful normality, arguing that there was a certain selectivity to what many people sought to remember, arguing that memories of genocide were not ones to cherish. Peukert further argued that: \"the memory of an unpolitical \"normality\" in the 1930s could have taken hold of the collective memory also because of a certain structural parallelism existed because of the \"normality\" of the first German economic miracle in the 1930s and the economic miracle of the 1950s\". Peukert argued that the central feature of the policies of the National Socialist regime in shaping the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" was racism with the emphasis on \"selection\" of those considered to have \"healthy\" Aryan genes and the \"eradication\" of those who were considered not. In the final chapter of \"Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde\", Peukert wrote: \"In the use of terror against \"gemeinschaftsfremde\" (\"community aliens\") and in the fostering of an atomized, compulsorily normalized society, National Socialism demonstrated all too clearly and with lethal consistency the pathological, warped features of the modern civilization process\". As \"Inside Nazi Germany\" as the book was titled in English, \"Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde\" is regarded as the most \"standard\" text about \"alltagsgeschichte\" in the Third Reich. A 1990 review by the German historian Rolf Schörken called \"Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde\" a brilliant book explaining how Nazi \"Herrschaft\" (domination) of Germany rested upon the \"multi-layered, contradictory and complex realities\" of \"everyday life\" in Germany.\n\nPeukert wrote that the popular claim, made after the war, that the Nazi regime stayed in power only because of terror was incorrect. Peukert wrote though terror played a role in sustaining the Nazi regime, the majority of victims of the violence of that the German state inflicted in the Nazi era tended to be people considered to be \"outsiders\" in Germany like Jews, the Romany, \"Marxists\", the mentally ill, the disabled, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the \"asocial\", and that for the most part, the state in the Nazi era left ordinary Germans alone to live their lives as they pleased. Peukert wrote with the \"popular experience\" of most Germans in the Nazi era, there were no clear-cut \"villains and victims\" with the American historian David Crews writing that Peukert had presented \"a complex, morally disturbing picture\" of ordinary people adjusting to what Peukert called \"the multiple ambiguities of ordinary people\". Peukert wrote that most ordinary Germans lived in a \"grey zone\" choosing support, accommodation and nonconformity at various times, never totally supporting the Nazi regime, but willing to accommodate themselves to the regime provided it served their own self-interests. As part of his studies into \"everyday life\" in Nazi Germany, Peukert very strongly argued that it was not a black-and-white picture with many of those taking part in youthful sub-cultures like the Edelweiss Pirates and the Swing Kids, grumbling at work, and attending illegal jazz dance sessions at very least partially endorsed the regime and accepted the \"Hitler myth\" of a brilliant, benevolent \"Führer\". Peukert noted those who took part in such manifestations of \"oppositionality\" like the Swing Kids and the Edelweiss Pirates were challenging the regime, but not in such a way as not to threaten its hold on power, which is why Peukert called these activities \"oppositionality\" rather than resistance. In particular, Peukert wrote the Edelweiss Pirates by settling themselves apart from adults and those not from the Rhineland were in fact weakening the traditional German working class sub-culture. Peukert wrote: \"The Third Reich cannot have failed to leave its mark on all members of society...Even resistance fighters who did not conform were weighted by the experience of persecution, by the sense of their own impotence, and of the petty compromises that were necessary for survival. The system did its work on the anti-fascists too, and often enough it worked despite the shortcomings of the fascists themselves\". Peukert wrote that even those Germans who went into \"inner emigration\", withdrawing from society as much as possible to avoid dealing with the Nazis as much as they could, helped the system worked. Peukert wrote that \"inner emigration\" led to \"...self-absorption and self-sufficiency, to the mixture of \"apathy and pleasure-seeking\" described by one wartime diarist...Paradoxically, then, even the population's counter-reaction to the National Socialist pressure of mobilization served to stabilize the system\".\n\nUsing a phrase coined by the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, Peukert argued that the \"Hitler myth\" of a brilliant, infallible, and larger-than-life \"Führer\"-a charismatic statesman who was also a talented general and artist-was the main psychological mechanism that held together popular support and acquiescence in the regime as even many Germans who did not like the Nazis accepted the \"Hitler myth\". Peukert noted that Hitler's role in standing in many ways above his system, with the standard explanation being that \"der Führer\" was so busy with questions of war, art and statecraft that he had to delegate policy in the domestic sphere to his subordinates meant that most Germans did not blame the failures of the Nazi system on Hitler. Peukert noted that instead of blaming Hitler, most Germans held to the hope that if only \"der Führer\" would pay attention to domestic policy, then matters would be set right. Peukert argued that many Germans disliked the NSDAP functionaries who assumed such power in their neighborhoods and believed if only their \"abuses\" were brought to Hitler's attention, he would dismiss them. In common with many historians, Peukert noted that the \"Hitler myth\" of a superhuman \"Führer\" who was steadily making Germany into the world's greatest power first began to fall apart with the German defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad as Hitler had staked his personal prestige on a victory on the Volga, repeatedly stating in his radio speeches in the fall of 1942 that he was executing his master-plan for victory at Stalingrad. The fact that Hitler's \"master-plan\" for victory at Stalingrad instead ended with the destruction of the entire German 6th Army, made worse by the fact that it was the hands of the \"Asiatic hordes\" as Nazi propaganda always called the Red Army, was a terrible blow to Hitler's prestige, but even then the \"Hitler myth\" continued to exert it power, albeit in a diluted form . Against the traditional view that the \"Hitler myth\" came \"from above\", being the work of Joseph Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry, Peukert argued that the \"Hitler myth\" came just as much \"from below\" as ordinary people chose to invest their hopes in the \"Hitler myth\" as a way of rationalizing their passivity in the Third Reich.\n\nAnother interest for Peukert were the experiences of youth in the Imperial, Weimar and Nazi era. In two books, \"Grenzen der Sozialdiziplinierung Austieg und Krise der deutschen Jugendfürsorge von 1878 bis 1932\" (\"The Frontiers of Social Discipline The Rise and Crisis of German Youth 1878 to 1932\") and its sequel, \"Jugend zwischen Krieg und Krise Lebenswetlen von Arbeiterjungen in der Weimarer Republik\" (\"Youth Between War and Crisis The World of Working Class Boys in the Weimar Republic\"), Peukert examined how the concept of \"jugendlicher\" (\"youth\") changed from the 19th into the 20th centuries and how the state sought to dominate the lives of youth people via education and mandatory activities. Both books were part of Peukert' habilitation, and reflected his lifelong interest in the experiences of young people in the Imperial, Weimar and Nazi eras.\n\nPeukert was one of the first historians to make a detailed examination of the persecution of the Romani. Peukert often compared Nazi policies towards Roma with Nazi policies towards Jews. On the basis of his research into popular attitudes towards \"outsiders\" in the Third Reich, Peukert came up with the concept of \"everyday racism\" to explain the contrast between the \"normality\" of life for most Germans while genocide was being committed. By \"everyday racism\", Peukert meant a certain causal racism that allowed people to accept violence being committed against those considered to be different. Peukert wrote about: \"a fatal continuum of discrimination, selection, and rejection/elimination, whose monstrous consequences perhaps remained hidden from most contemporaries in their totality but whose inhumane daily racism was not only constantly and everywhere present but until today has not been critically worked through\". As part of his research into \"everyday racism\", Peukert explored how ordinary people use of disparaging language to describe the homeless allowed them to see as justified the mass incarceration of the homeless into the concentration camps under the grounds that the homeless were part of the \"asocial\" threatening the \"volksgemeinschaft\". In his research into opinion during the war years, Peukert noted that thousands of Polish and Frenchmen were brought to work in Germany as slave laborers to replace German men who been called up into the Wehrmacht. Those Poles and sometimes Frenchmen found to be enjoying sexual relationships with German women were harshly punished, being publicity hanged and on some occasions castrated as \"race-defilers\" threatening the \"Volksgemeinschaft\". Peukert noted even through the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" as depicted in Nazi propaganda never really existed, many ordinary Germans if not sharing the exactly the same racial ideology as their regime seemed to approve of these executions as necessary to protect German racial purity. As a homosexual, Peukert was especially interested in the Nazi persecution of homosexuals. As a gay man, Peukert was especially troubled by those who used the homosexuality of Nazi leaders like Ernst Röhm as an excuse for homophobia, writing: \"The National Socialists' fundamental hostility to homosexuals should not be trivialized by references to individual Nazi leaders' homosexuality. The disgraceful denunciation of SA leader Ernst Röhm, precisely by the Social Democratic press, to gain votes in 1930, thus sullying its own liberal tradition, was taken up again after the so-called Röhm \"putsch\" of 1934 and used by the National Socialists to justify their murderous actions\".\n\nAnother interest of Peukert were the youth movements like the Swing Kids and the Edelweiss Pirates that clashed with the Nazi regime. The American historian Peter Baldwin criticized Peukert for treating the Swing Kids and Edelweiss Pirates sent to concentration camps as morally just as much as victims of the National Socialist regime as the Jews exterminated in the death camps. Baldwin took Peukert to task for his 1987 statement: \"As long as the Nazis needed armament workers and future soldiers, they could not exterminate German youth as they exterminated the Poles and Jews\". Baldwin called this statement \"a wholly fanciful suggestion\" that the Nazi leaders were planning to exterminate the young people of Germany, going on to comment that the reader should \"note also the order of priority among the actual victims\". Baldwin wrote that \"This is Reagan's Bitburg fallacy of the SS as victims, this time committed from the Left\". In 1985, the U.S. president Ronald Reagan had taken part in a memorial ceremony at a cemetery in Bitburg whose graves were those of soldiers killed in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS. When criticized for honoring the sacrifice of SS men, Reagan had stated those Germans killed fighting in the SS were just as much victims of Hitler as the Jews exterminated in the death camps, and that therefore placing a memorial wreath honoring the memory of the SS men buried at the Bitburg cemetery was no different from placing a memorial wreath at Auschwitz. Reagan's statement that the SS and the Jews exterminated by the SS were all equally victims of Hitler is known to historians as the Bitburg fallacy.\n\nIn his 1987 book \"Spuren des Widerstands Die Bergarbeiterbewegung im Dritten Reich und im Exil\" (\"Traces of Resistance The Miners' Movement in the Third Reich and In Exile\"), Peukert began with the question \"How does one write a history of continual failure?\", which he answered with \"To write a history of the resistance from the \"loser's\" viewpoint means trying to understand why, in spite of everything, they did not give up\". Peukert argued even through the Social Democratic and Communist miners failed utterly in their attempts to overthrow the Nazi dictatorship, their willingness to take a stand, no matter how hopeless, and to suffer for their beliefs in the concentration camps meant that they should not be dismissed by historians as \"losers\". In the late 1980s, Peukert had been working as a project for a comprehensive \"alltagsgeschichte\" in Nazi Germany in northern Germany that was intended to be the counterpart to the \"Bavaria project\" led by Martin Broszat that sought to produce a comprehensive \"alltagsgeschichte\" in Nazi Germany in Bavaria.\n\nIn his 1982 book \"Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde\" (\"National Comrades and Community Aliens\"), Peukert argued that the Nazi regime's:\"racism offered a model for a new order in society...It rested on the racially legitimated removal of all elements that deviated from the norm, refractory youth, idlers, the asocial, prostitutes, homosexuals, people who were incompetent or failures at work, the disabled. National Socialist eugenics...laid down criteria of assessment that were applicable to the population at whole\". Peukert described the aim of National Socialism as:“ The goal was an utopian \"Volksgemeinschaft\", totally under police surveillance, in which any attempt at nonconformist behaviour, or even any hint or intention of such behaviour, would be visited with terror”. At the same time, Peukert argued that the \"völkisch\" ideology was not \"an inexplicable, sudden appearance of 'medieval barbarism' in a progressive society\" but rather \"demonstrated with heightened clarity and murderous consistency, the pathologies and seismic fractures of the modern civilizing progress\". Peukert's thesis that all aspects of the National Socialist regime reflected the \"völkisch\" ideology and that far from being a break with modernity, that the National Socialism regime represented at very least an aspect of modernity was very novel at the time and proved to be influential on the historiography of Nazi Germany.\n\nFascinated by the theories of Max Weber, Peukert began his last book with a quote from Weber who warned that the modern age would bring about \"experts without spirit\" and the \"hedonist without a heart\". Peukert went on to write about this modern age: \"At its beginning there is immense loneliness and religious distress, which however help to bring about an unsuspected enhancement of the individual's attachment to this life, his rational control of the world and intellectual autonomy; at its end we may find routine \"enslavement to the future\", emptied of all meaning and causing the dynamic, expansive force of rationalization to ossify. In both cases, however, the growing pressure of suffering is the price paid for the gain in rationality\". For Peukert, inspired by the theories of Weber, saw the purpose of his work to help foster experts who have spirit and hedonists with a heart. Through Peukert worked primarily as a historian (an occupation that has far greater prestige in Germany than it does in the English-speaking world), he also wrote about at times about literacy theory, philosophy, and anthropology. Peukert was also politically engaged, and his last essay written shortly before his death, \"Rechtsradikalismus in historisher Perspektive\" (\"Right-wing Radicalism in the Historical Perspective\") warned against the rise of the Republican Party led by the former SS-\"Unterscharführer\" Franz Schönhuber, which had some popular support in Germany with its call for a ban on Turkish \"guest workers\". In 1988, Peukert was appointed director of the Research Center for the History of National Socialism at Hamburg University and in 1989 was appointed Chair of Modern History at the University of Essen. The attempt to appoint Peukert to Hamburg University caused much opposition from the more conservative historians, who made it clear they did not want an openly gay man teaching at their university. Until 1994, Paragraph 175 was still in effect in Germany as homophobia was rampant in Germany long after the end of the Third Reich, and many historians did not want to work with a \"criminal\" like Peukert.\n\nOne of the central issues of German historiography has been the debate over the \"Sonderweg\" question, namely whatever German history in the 19th and 20th centuries developed along such lines as to make the Third Reich inevitable. The \"Bielefeld School\" associated with Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Jurgen Kocka and others have argued for a failed modernization of Germany with the \"Junkers\" holding inordinate political and social power in the 19th century that led to Nazi Germany in the 20th century. The most famous riposte to the \"Sonderweg\" thesis was the 1984 book \"The Peculiarities of German history\" by two British Marxist historians, David Blackbourn and Geoff Eley. In \"The Peculiarities of German History\", Eley and Blackourn argued for the \"normality\" of modern German history.\n\nPeukert rejected both viewpoints, instead arguing for seeing Nazi Germany as the product of the \"crisis of classical modernity\". One of the central objections to the \"normality\" thesis promoted by Eley and Blackbourn has been if Germany was such a \"normal\" and \"modern\" nation, how does one explain the Holocaust? Though Peukert rejected the \"Sonderweg\" thesis, he criticized Eley and Blackbourn for associating modernity with \"progress\", and argued for a \"skeptical de-coupling of modernity and progress\". Peukert argued that historians must: \"raise questions about the pathological and seismic fractures within modernity itself, and about the implicit destructive tendencies of modern industrial class society, which National Socialism made explicit and which elevated it into mass destruction...This approach is supported by a wide variety of debates that have gone within the social sciences, using such notions as 'social disciplining' (Foucault), the pathological consequences of the civilizing progress (Elias), or the colonisation of the \"Lebenswelten\" (Habermas). Peukert often wrote on the social and cultural history of the Weimar Republic whose problems he saw as more severe examples of the problems of modernity. Peukert argued that societies that have reached \"classical modernity\" are characterized by advanced capitalist economic organization and mass production, by the \"rationalization\" of culture and society, massive bureaucratization of society, the \"spirit of science\" assuming a dominant role in popular discourses, and the \"social disciplining\" and \"normalization\" of the majority of ordinary people. Peukert was greatly influenced by the theories of Max Weber, but unlike many other scholars, who saw Weber attempting to rebut Karl Marx, he viewed Weber's principle intellectual opponent as Friedrich Nietzsche. Peukert wrote that for Weber, the principle problems of modern Germany were:\n\nContrary to the \"Bielefield school\", Peukert argued by the time of the Weimar Republic, Germany had broken decisively with the past, and had become a thoroughly \"modern\" society in all its aspects. Peukert argued that the very success of German modernization inspired by the \"dream of reason\" meant the contradictions and problems of \"classical modernity\" were felt more acutely in Germany than elsewhere. For Peukert, the problems of \"classical modernity\" were:\n\nPeukert argued that starting in 1929 that the disjoint between Weimar democracy vs. the problems of \"classical modernity\" started to fell apart when faced with the Great Depression. Peukert maintained that the Weimar Republic was a muddled system built out of the compromises between so many different interests with for instance Weimar Coalition consisting of the left-wing SPD, the liberal DDP, and the centre-right \"Zentrum\" being the only political parties wholeheartedly committed to the Weimar republic. Other competing interests in Germany included the struggle between men vs. women, farmers vs. towns, Catholics vs. Protestants, and unions vs. business. Peukert argued that the creation of the Weimar welfare state in the 1920s had \"politicized\" economic and social relationships, and in the context of the Great Depression where economic resources were shrinking set off a Darwinian struggle for scare economic resources between various societal groups. Peukert wrote by 1930 German society had with the notable exceptions of the working class and the Catholic milieus had turned into a mass of competing social interests engaged in a Darwinian \"verteilungskampf\" (distribution struggle). In this context, Peukert argued that for much of German society, some sort of authoritarian government was welcome out of the belief that an authoritarian regime would favor one's own special interest group at the expense of the others. Given the \"verteilungskampf\", Peukert argued that this explain why the \"presidential governments\"-which from March 1930 onward by-passed the \"Reichstag\" and that answered only to President Paul von Hindenburg-governing Germany in a highly authoritarian manner were so approved of by German elites. Peukert further maintained that the Hitler government of 1933, which was the last of the \"presidential governments\" was merely the final attempt by traditional elites in Germany to safeguard their status. Peukert insisted that National Socialism was not some retrogression to the past, but instead reflected the \"dark side\" of modernity, writing: \"The NSDAP was at once a symptom and a solution to the crisis\".\n\nPeukert saw his work as a \"warning against the fallacious notion that the normality of industrial society is harmless\" and urged historians to consider the \"dark side of modernity\", instead of seeing modernity as a benign development that was always for the best. Peukert wrote: \"The view that National Socialism was...one of the pathological development forms of modernity does not imply that barbarism is the inevitable logical outcome of modernization. The point, rather, is that we should not analyse away the tensions between progressive and aberrant features by making a glib opposition between modernity and tradition: we should call attention to the rifts and danger-zones which result from the civilizing process itself, so that the opportunities for human emancipation which it simultaneously creates can be more thoroughly charted. The challenges of Nazism shows that the evolution to modernity is not a one-way trip to freedom. The struggle for freedom must always be resumed afresh, both in inquiry and in action\". \n\nPeukert argued that though \"völkisch\" racism was extreme, it was by no means exceptional, and instead reflected the logic promoted by the social sciences throughout the West which had argued that the state can and should foster \"normality\" while identifying \"the non-conformity that is to be segregated and eliminated\". Seen in this perspective, for Peukert the genocide against the Jews and Romany were only part of a wider project to eliminate all unhealthy genes from the \"volksgemeinschaft\". Peukert argued for an integrated view of Nazi Germany with the social policies to encourage \"healthy Aryan\" families to have more children, the \"social racism\" that saw the bodies of \"healthy Aryan\" women as belonging to the \"volksgemeinschaft\", the effort to sterilize \"anti-social families\" and the extermination of Jews and Romany as part and parcel of the same project. Likewise, Peukert argued that Nazi Germany was not some freakish \"aberration\" from the norms of Western civilization, as he noted that the ideas about eugenics and racial superiority that the National Socialists drew upon were widely embraced throughout the Western world.\n\nIn the same way, Peukert noted in \"Inside Nazi Germany\" as part of his argument against the \"freakish aberration\" view of the Nazi era that homosexual sex had been made illegal in Germany with Paragraph 175 in 1871 and all the Nazis did with the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 was to make it tougher, as the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 made being homosexual in and of itself a criminal offense, whereas the 1871 version of Paragraph 175 had only made homosexual sex a criminal offense. Peukert also noted against the \"freakish aberration\" view of Nazi Germany that the 1935 version of Paragraph 175 stayed on the statue books in West Germany until 1969 as it was considered to be a \"healthy law\", leading to German homosexuals who survived the concentration camps continuing to be convicted all through the 1950s and 1960s under exactly the same law that sent them to the concentration camps under the Third Reich. Peukert further commented that the Federal Republic of Germany never paid reparations to those homosexuals who survived the concentration camps as Paragraph 175 was considered a \"healthy law\" that was worth keeping, and those homosexual survivors who suffered so much in the concentration camps remained outcasts in post-war Germany. Writing in the 1970s and 1980s at a time when Paragraph 175 was still in effect, Peukert argued that the sort of homophobia which made the Nazi persecution of homosexuals possible, was still very much present in modern West Germany. In the same way, Peukert wrote the \"everyday racism\" that allowed ordinary people to accept violence directed against \"others\" in the Third Reich had not disappeared, noting that many ordinary Germans were willing to accept neo-Nazi skinheads beating up Turkish guest workers because they were \"foreigners\". Crews writing in 1992 wrote that the \"recent epidemic of violence against 'foreigners' in both the 'old' and 'new' \"Länder\" suggests he may have been right\".\n\nPeukert wrote that through the Nazis did use an \"anti-modernist\" disclosure inspired by the theories of Houston Stewart Chamberlain, but their solution to the problems of \"classical modernity\" were not \"merely backward-looking\". Peukert wrote the attempt to create the \"volksgemeinschaft\" was not an effort to return to the pre—industrial age, but rather a purged and cleansed \"classical modernity\". Peukert wrote: \"Eclectic as regards to ideas, but up to date in its attitude to technology, National Socialism laid claims to offer a \"conclusive\" new answer to the challenges and discomforts of the modern age\". Peukert wrote that: \"The much heralded \"Volksgemeinschaft\" of the National Socialists in no way abolished the real contradictions of a modern industrial society; rather these were inadvertently aggravated by the use of highly modern industrial and propaganda techniques for achieving war readiness. In fact, the long-term characteristics of a modern industrial society, which had been interrupted by the world economic crisis, continued to run their course\". Reflecting the influence of functionalist historians like Martin Broszat and Hans Mommsen, Peukert wrote the inability to achieve the idealized \"volksgemeinschaft\" of their dreams left the National Socialists increasingly frustrated and led them to lash out against groups considered to be enemies of the \"volksgemeinschaft\" as a way of compensation.\n\nPeukert argued that for the National Socialists' \"it was more important to travel hopefully than to arrive\", as for the Nazis had no solutions to the problems of classical modernity other than a creating a sense of movement towards the vague goal of the utopian society that was to be the \"volksgemeinschaft\". Peukert wrote the \"violent answers\" of the Nazis to the \"contradictions of modernity\" were not the basis of a successful social order, and as such the dynamism of the Nazi movement was primarily negative and the \"movement\" had a strong self-destructive streak. Peukert noted that having promised \"paradise\" in the form of the \"volksgemeinschaft\" under the Weimar republic, there was much frustration within the Nazi movement when in 1933 the \"volksgemeinschaft\" in reality did not meet the idealized version of the \"volksgemeinschaft\" that had promised before 1933. Peukert wrote that because of this frustration that the Nazis gave the \"volksgemeinschaft\" an increasing negative definition, lashing out in increasing vicious ways against any perceived \"threats\" to the \"volksgemeinschaft\". As part of this trend, there was a tendency as the Third Reich went along for the Nazis to seek to erase all nonconformity, deviance and differences from German society with anyone who was not a perfect \"Volksgenossen\" (\"National Comrade\") considered to be in someway an \"enemy\". In this way, the violence that the Nazis had directed against \"outsiders\" in Germany had gradually started to be applied against at least some of the previous \"insiders\" as those \"Volksgenossen\" who for whatever reason did not quite measure up to the ideal found there was no place for them in the \"volksgemeinschaft\". Peukert concluded that the National Socialists failed to create the idealized \"volksgemeinschaft\", but they unwittingly laid the foundations for the stability of the Adenauer era in 1950s West Germany by promoting a mass consumerist society combined with extreme violence against their \"enemies\", which made politically engagement dangerous. Peukert argued that what many considered to be the most notable aspect of the Adenauer era, namely an atomized, materialistic society made up of people devoted to consumerism and generally indifferent to politics was the Nazi legacy in West Germany.\n\nIn the last chapter of his 1987 book \"Die Weimarer Republik : Krisenjahre der Klassischen Moderne\", Peukert quoted Walter Benjamin's remark: \"The concept of progress must be rooted in catastrophe. The fact that things just \"carry on\" \"is\" the catastrophe\".\n\nPeukert was fluent in Spanish, and was very interested in the history of Latin America, especially the Dominican Republic, which he spent much of the late 1980s visiting. As the name Detlev is hard for Spanish speakers to pronounce, Peukert took to calling himself \"Julio\" Peukert. Peukert was interested in youth policy in the Dominican Republic and spent much time in the \"barrios\" (slums) of Santo Domingo working as a volunteer helping poor teenagers. In 1986, Peuket published a book in Spanish \"Anhelo de Dependencia Las Ofertas de Anexion de la Republica Dominicana a los Estados Unidos en siglo XIX\" about the debate concerning American plans to annex the Dominican Republic in the 19th century. Always a politically engaged historian, Peukert engaged in city planning for Santo Domingo and criticized the Dominican government for not doing more to help with the problems of poverty. At the time of his death, Peukert had begun writing a biography of the Dominican dictator General Rafael Trujillo.\n\nPeukert is perhaps best known for his 1989 essay “The Genesis of the 'Final Solution’ from the Spirit of Science” from his book \"Max Webers Diagnose der Moderne\". Peukert began his essay with an attack on the conservative side in the \"Historikerstreit\", stating that the obsession of Ernst Nolte with proving that Hitler had been somehow forced into committing genocide by the fear of the Soviet Union was an apologistic argument meant to diminish the horror of Auschwitz. Peukert further noted that on the origins of the Holocaust question that the internationalist argument that the \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\" was all part of a master-plan carried out by Hitler and a few of his followers is not longer accepted by most historians with the \"Final Solution\" being seen instead as the product of several processes coming together at the same time. Peukert wrote that the \"Shoah\" was not the result solely of anti-Semitism, but was instead the a product of the “cumulative radicalization” in which “numerous smaller currents” fed into the “broad current” that led to genocide. Peukert wrote the Holocaust was a product of:\n\nPeukert wrote all \"monocausal explanations of the 'Final Solution' are inadequate\", but then asked if out of this \"tangle of causes\" one might find a \"central thread\" linking them all. Peukert suggested that this \"thread\" was not antisemitism-through he admitted that Jews were the largest single group of victims of the Nazi regime-but rather the \"fatal racist dynamism present within the human and social sciences\", which divided all people into terms of \"value\" and \"non-value\", and made the \"volkskörper\" (the collective \"body\" of the \"German race\") its main concern with the \"selection\" of those with healthy genes and the \"eradication\" of those with unhealthy genes. In this regard, Peukert noted the genocide against the Jews grew out of the Action T4 program which starting in January 1939 sought to liquidate all physically and mentally disabled Germans as a threat to the health of the \"volkskörper\". Peukert wrote that it was not antisemitism per se that led to genocide, but rather the project to purge the \"volksgemeinschaft\" of those seen as carrying unhealthy genes that was the beginning of genocide, which started with the Action T4 program. Peukert argued that the Holocaust was not inevitable, but in the story of the \"cumulative radicalization\" of Nazi racial policy, \"the most deadly option for action was selected at every stage\". Within the context of an ideology that divided the entire population of the world into people of \"value\" and people of \"non-value\" , decision-makers in the Nazi state had choices about what policy to pursue, and always chose the most extreme option. Peukert made it clear in \"The Genesis of the 'Final Solution' from the Spirit of Science\" that he was describing a necessary, but not a sufficient cause for the \"Final Solution\", arguing that without the \"spirit of science\" there would have been no genocide, but the \"spirit of science\" was not sufficient in itself for the decisions that were taken between 1939-1941.\n\nPeukert argued in his essay that the late 19th and early 20th centuries had seen tremendous scientific and technological change together with, in Germany, the growth of the welfare state, which had created widespread hopes both within the government and in society that “utopia” was at hand and soon all social problems would be solved. Peukert wrote:\"From the 1890s...the conviction that social reform was necessary was increasingly outflanked and overtaken by the belief that all social problems could find their rational solution through state intervention and scientific endeavor...The dream of a final solution to the social problem resonated in the plans of the 'social engineers', regardless of whatever they were active as youth welfare workers, social hygienists or city planners. Just as medicine had put paid to bacteria, so too, the union of science and social technology in public interventions would make all social problems disappear\". Peukert wrote that by the beginning of the 20th century, the pattern of death had changed from being common amongst young people to being only common amongst the old, and this \"banishment of death from everyday life\" dramatically increased the prestige of science so that it was believed would soon solve all social problems.\n\nAt the same time, owing to the great prestige of science, a scientific racist, Social Darwinist and eugenicist worldview which declared some people to be more biologically “valuable” than others was common amongst German elites. Peukert argued that because the modern welfare state began in Germany in the 1870s, that this had encouraged an \"utopian\" view of social policy within Germany. Peukert wrote that the great success by medical practitioners in reducing morality in the 19th century had encouraged hopes that practitioners of the new emerging social sciences like sociology, criminology and psychology would soon solve all problems and personal unhappiness would be banished forever. At the same time, Peukert argued that the \"spirit of science\" had aided the rise of racism. Peukert argued that scientific advances had reduced morality, but could not end death, and unlike religion, science could offer no spiritual consolation. Peukert wrote that for precisely these reasons, scientific racism was embraced since though the body of the individual would inevitably end, the \"volkskörper\" (the \"eternal\" body of the race) would live on. Peukert wrote that \"actual target of scientific effort\" switched from \"the individual, whose cause in the long run was always hopeless, to the \"body\" of the nation, the \"volkskörper\"\". In this sense, ensuring the survival of the \"healthy genes\" was a bid for a type of immortality. Conversely, this required the elimination of \"deficient genes\" carried by the \"unfit\".\n\nPeukert wrote that as death is inevitable, scientists and those influenced by the scientists came to become obsessed with improving the health of the \"volk\" via \"racial hygiene\" as a bid for a sort of immorality. Peukert stated \"the conquest of the world by a secularized, scientific rationality was so overwhelming, that the switch from religion to science as the main source of a meaning-creating mythology for everyday life took place almost without resistance. The result, however, was that science took upon itself a burden of responsibility that it would soon find a heavy one\". Peukert wrote science could not offer spiritual consolation as in a world dominated by science the question of \"how can the rationalist, secular ideal of the greatest happiness of the greatest number be vindicated, given that it is rebutted in the case of each individual by illness, suffering and death?\", which was impossible to answer. As such, scientists came to be concerned with the body of the individual as a way of determining if that individual should be allowed to pass on his/her genes to the next generation with the criterion being whatever the individual was of \"value\" or not. In this way, there was a shift from the individual as the center of medical concern to the collective of the \"volkskörper\" (the \"body\" of the entire race).\n\nPeukert argued that the very growth of the welfare state under the Weimar Republic ensured the backlash when social problems were not solved was especially severe. Peukert wrote: \"Weimar installed the new principle of the social state, in which, on the one hand, the citizen could now claim public assistance in (his/her) social and personal life, while on the other, the state set up the institutional and normative framework, (defining how) a 'normal' life of the citizen of the state could progress...This process, which had already began before the turn of the century, reached its apex in the Weimar Republic and was also thrown into crisis, as the limits of social technology could achieve were reached in every direction\". Peukert wrote that after the First World War, the pre-war mood of optimism gave way to disillusionment as German bureaucrats found social problems to be more insolvable than at first thought, which in turn, guided by the prevailing Social Darwinist and eugenicist values led them to place increasing emphasis on saving the biologically “fit” while the biologically “unfit” were to be written off. Peukert used as an example that fact that social workers had before the First World War had believed it was possible to ensure that every child in Germany was brought up in a happy home and by 1922 were instead declaring that certain young people were \"biologically\" prone to being \"unfit\", requiring a law on detention that was to remove them from society forever. Peukert maintained that after 1929, when the Great Depression began, the economic limits of the welfare state to end poverty were cruelly exposed, which led German social scientists and doctors to argue that the \"solution\" was now to protect the \"valuable\" in society from the \"incurable\". Peukert wrote that rather than accept that the \"spirit of science\" could not solve all social problems, those who believed in the \"spirit of science\" started to blame the victims of poverty themselves for their plight, depicting their poverty as due to biological instead of economic factors, and began to devise measures to exclude the biologically \"incurable\" from society. Peukert described the appeal of National Socialism to scientists and social engineers as offering a simplistic \"racial\" explanations for social failures in modern Germany, which allowed those making social policy to disregard economic and psychological factors as a reason for why some families were \"losers\".\n\nPeukert wrote that when faced with the same financial contains that their predecessors in the Imperial and Weimar periods had faced, social workers, teachers, professors and doctors in the Third Reich began to advocate plans to ensure that the genes of the \"racially unfit\" would not be passed on to the next generation, first via sterilization and then by killing them. Furthermore, Peukert argued that \"völkisch\" racism was part of a male backlash against women's emancipation, and was a way of asserting control over women's bodies, which were viewed in a certain sense as public property since women had the duty of bearing the next generation that would pass on the \"healthy genes\". Peukert maintained that as the bearers of the next generation of Germans that Nazi social policies fell especially heavily upon German women. Peukert that for \"volksgenossenlinnen\" (female \"national comrades\"), any hint of non-conformity and the \"pleasures of refusal\" in not playing their designated role within the \"volksgemeinschaft\" as the bearers of the next generation of soldiers could expect harsh punishments such as sterilization, incarceration in a concentration camp or for extreme case \"vernichtung\" (\"extermination\"). Peukert wrote that \"after 1933 any critical public discussion and any critique of racism in the human sciences from amongst the ranks of the experts was eliminated: from then on, the protective...instances of the \"Rechstaat\" (legal state) no longer stood between the racist perpetrators and their victims; from then on, the dictatorial state put itself solely on the side of racism\". Peukert argued that all of the National Socialist social policies such as natalist policies that relentlessly pressured Aryan women to have more and children were all part of the same effort to strengthen the \"volksgemeinschaft\". Peukert argued that despite a turn towards Social Darwinism when confronted with the failure of the welfare state to solve all social problems in the 1920s, that it was the democratic Weimar constitution that had provided a thin legal wedge that prevented the full implications of this from being worked out.\n\nPeukert argued that in 1939 that the entire system that had been built up for scientifically identifying those of racial \"non-value\" served as the apparatus for genocide. Peukert wrote that the all of the criterion for identifying Jews and Romany as peoples of racial \"non-value\" was based on the pseudo-scientific theories that had been promoted by generations of \"race scientists\" and that those serving in the \"human sciences and social professions\" worked to provide the theories for an \"all-embracing racist restructuring of social policy, educational policy and health and welfare policy\". The culmination of these efforts was the proposed 1944 \"Law for the Treatment of Community Aliens\" which called for sending to the concentration camps anyone who failed to live be up to be a proper \"'volksgenossen\" as a \"gemeinschaftsfremde\" (community alien). Only the fact that Germany was fully engaged in World War II prevented Hitler from signing \"Law for the Treatment of Community Aliens\", which was put off until the \"Reich\" won the \"final victory\". Peukert wrote: \"Nazi racism, the professed goal which had been to secure the immorality of the racially pure \"volkskörper\" in practice inevitably became converted into a crusade against life\".\n\nPeukert wrote that the Holocaust would never had happened without the shift from the thinking of scientists from concern with the body of the individual to concern with the body of the collective \"volkskörper\", the tendency to break society into those of \"value\" and those of \"lesser value\" and with seeing the solution to social problems as eliminating the genes of those of \"lesser value\". Peukert wrote that the fascination with pseudo-scientific racial theories and eugenics were common to all of the West, but it was the specific conditions in Germany which allowed the National Socialists to come to power 1933 that led to the \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\". Peukert wrote: \"The 'death of God' in the nineteenth century gave science dominion over life. For each individual human being, however, the borderline experience of death rebuts this claim to dominion. Science therefore sought its salvation in the specious immorality of the racial \"volkskörper\", for the sake of which real-and hence more imperfect-life could be sacrificed. Thus the instigators of the \"Final Solution\" finally achieved dominion over death\". Through Peukert was on the left, the conservative American intellectual M.D. Aeschliman praised Peukert's essay in \"The National Review\" as \"important\" and \"haunting\".\n\nPeukert wrote that after the war that scientists who had provided the intellectual justification for the \"Final Solution\" were not prosecuted and a massive effort to block the memory of their actions started which largely prevented any discussion of the subject in the 1950s-1960s. Peukert ended his essay that that there were debates about \"our dealings with others, notably those different from ourselves. Recent debates about foreign migrants and AIDs present a conflicting picture. On one hand, we can see the continuing survival of a discourse on segregation, untouched by any historical self-consciousness. On the other hand, however, there is a considerable body of opinion pledging for tolerance and responsibility that spring from an awareness of German history and of the genesis of the \"Final Solution\" from the spirit of science\".\n\nPeukert died of AIDS in 1990, aged 39. The British historian Richard Bessel described Peukert's last months as a \"nightmare of suffering\". At the time, there were no drugs to treat HIV, and Peukert died in much agony, but was described by as having kept his spirits up the end.\n\nIn a 2017 review of the 2015 book \"Detlev Peukert und die NS-Forschung\" (\"Detlev Peukert and the National Socialist Research\") the American historian Helmut Walser Smith called Peukert one of \"the most prolific German historians of the post-war era\" who wrote important books in social history, \"extremely influential articles, like ‘The Final Solution from the Spirit of Science’, still often cited\" and \"stunning, provocative works of synthesis\" such as his book on the Weimar Republic. Smith wrote that in general most historians have issues with his thesis about the Weimar Republic as a paradigm of \"classical modernity\", writing that the concept of \"classical modernity\" was too vague and that Peukert's point that modernity does not automatically equal freedom now seems self-evident.\n\nThe editors of \"Detlev Peukert und die NS-Forschung\", Rüdiger Hachtmann and Sven Reichardt, argued that Peukert was one of the most important historians on the Nazi era as he shifted research from the subject of \"Verführung und Gewalt\" (Seduction and Violence) to \"Volksgenossen und Gemeinschaftsfremde\" (National Comrades and Community Aliens) focusing on \"the role of ordinary people, as insiders (believers, conformers, bystanders) in their relation to perceived outsiders.\" One of the contributors to \"Detlev Peukert und die NS-Forschung\", Nikolaus Wachsmann, argued that Peukert's focus on looking at all groups victimized by the Nazi regime as \"Gemeinschaftsfremde\" (Community Aliens) such as the Romany, homosexuals, and the disabled missed the centrality of \"völkisch\" anti-Semitic ideology to the \"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\". Wachsmann further noted that a central problem with Peukert's work was it was entirely concerned with Germany and he missed that the majority of the people killed by the Nazi regime were in Eastern Europe.\n\nWaschsman criticized Peukert for failing to go beyond his own point that the violence of the Nazi regime tended to be directed against people considered to be \"outsiders\" in Germany which meant the vast majority of the victims of Nazi violence were people in Eastern Europe, observing that Peukert had little to say about the extermination of Eastern European Jews, the sheer brutality of German policies in Poland or the mass murder of three million Red Army POWs in 1941-42 as all this happened outside of Germany. Smith in his review largely agreed with Waschman's point about that Peukert's focus on developments entirely within Germany was limited one. However, Smith argued that Peukert's \"subtle understanding of consent, accommodation and non-conformity\" by ordinary people in Nazi Germany still made him relevant today as Peukert helped show how the absence of \"public protest and genuine outrage at the treatment of others\" made genocide possible.\n\nIn 2016, the American journalist Rod Dreher wrote that much about what Peukert described as \"crisis of classical modernity\" in the Weimar Republic was applicable to the modern United States, citing Peukert's remarks about the cultural struggle between the \"avant-garde\" Weimar culture vs. the traditional militarist culture, the \"crisis of youth\" and debates about masculinity in Weimar Germany. In 2017, the British historian Jane Caplan approvingly quoted Peukert's remarks about how best to confront fascism as still relevant today, citing his statement from \"Inside Nazi Germany\": \"The values we should assert [in response to fascism] are easily stated but hard to practise: reverence for life, pleasure in diversity and contrariety, respect for what is alien, tolerance for what is unpalatable, scepticism about the feasibility and desirability of chiliastic schemes for a global new order, openness towards others and a willingness to learn even from those who call into question one’s own principles of social virtue.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9674", "title": "Einhard", "text": "Einhard\n\nEinhard (also Eginhard or Einhart; ; 775 – March 14, 840 AD) was a Frankish scholar and courtier. Einhard was a dedicated servant of Charlemagne and his son Louis the Pious; his main work is a biography of Charlemagne, the \"Vita Karoli Magni\", \"one of the most precious literary bequests of the early Middle Ages.\"\n\nEinhard was from the eastern German-speaking part of the Frankish Kingdom. Born into a family of landowners of some importance, his parents sent him to be educated by the monks of Fulda - one of the most impressive centers of learning in the Frank lands. Perhaps due to his small stature, which restricted his riding and sword-fighting ability, Einhard concentrated his energies on scholarship, especially the mastering of Latin. He was accepted into the hugely wealthy court of Charlemagne around 791 or 792. Charlemagne actively sought to amass scholarly men around him and established a royal school led by the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin. Einhard evidently was a talented builder and construction manager, because Charlemagne put him in charge of the completion of several palace complexes including Aachen and Ingelheim. Despite the fact that Einhard was on intimate terms with Charlemagne, he never achieved office in his reign. In 814, on Charlemagne's death, his son Louis the Pious made Einhard his private secretary. Einhard retired from court during the time of the disputes between Louis and his sons in the spring of 830.\n\nHe died at Seligenstadt in 840.\n\nEinhard was married to Emma, of whom little is known. There is a possibility that their marriage bore a son, Vussin. Their marriage also appears to have been exceptionally liberal for the period, with Emma being as active as Einhard, if not more so, in the handling of their property. It is said that in the later years of their marriage Emma and Einhard abstained from sexual relations, choosing instead to focus their attentions on their many religious commitments. Though he was undoubtedly devoted to her, Einhard wrote nothing of his wife until after her death on 13 December 835, when he wrote to a friend that he was reminded of her loss in ‘every day, in every action, in every undertaking, in all the administration of the house and household, in everything needing to be decided upon and sorted out in my religious and earthly responsibilities’.\nEinhard made numerous references to himself as a \"sinner\" according to his strong Christian faith. He erected churches at both of his estates in Michelstadt and Mulinheim. In Michelstadt, he also saw fit to build a basilica completed in 827 and then sent a servant, Ratleic, to Rome with an end to find relics for the new building. Once in Rome, Ratleic robbed a catacomb of the bones of the Martyrs Marcellinus and Peter and had them translated to Michelstadt. Once there, the relics made it known they were unhappy with their new tomb and thus had to be moved again to Mulinheim. Once established there, they proved to be miracle workers. Although unsure as to why these saints should choose such a \"sinner\" as their patron, Einhard nonetheless set about ensuring they continued to receive a resting place fitting of their honour. Between 831 and 834 he founded a Benedictine Monastery and, after the death of his wife, served as its Abbot until his own death in 840.\n\nLocal lore from Seligenstadt portrays Einhard as the lover of Emma, one of Charlemagne's daughters, and has the couple elope from court. Charlemagne found them at Seligenstadt (then called Obermühlheim) and forgave them. This account is used to explain the name \"Seligenstadt\" by folk etymology. Einhard and his wife were originally buried in one sarcophagus in the choir of the church in Seligenstadt, but in 1810 the sarcophagus was presented by the Grand Duke of Hesse to the count of Erbach, who claims descent from Einhard as the husband of Imma, the reputed daughter of Charlemagne. The count put it in the famous chapel of his castle at Erbach in the Odenwald.\n\nThe most famous of Einhard's works is his biography of Charlemagne, the \"Vita Karoli Magni\", \"The Life of Charlemagne\" (c. 817–836), which provides much direct information about Charlemagne's life and character, written sometime between 817 and 830. In composing this he relied heavily upon the Royal Frankish Annals. Einhard's literary model was the classical work of the Roman historian Suetonius, the \"Lives of the Caesars\", though it is important to stress that the work is very much Einhard's own, that is to say he adapts the models and sources for his own purposes. His work was written as a praise of Charlemagne, whom he regarded as a foster-father (\"nutritor\") and to whom he was a debtor \"in life and death\". The work thus contains an understandable degree of bias, Einhard taking care to exculpate Charlemagne in some matters, not mention others, and to gloss over certain issues which would be of embarrassment to Charlemagne, such as the morality of his daughters; by contrast, other issues are curiously not glossed over, like his concubines.\n\nEinhard is also responsible for three other extant works: a collection of letters, \"On the Translations and the Miracles of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus\", and \"On the Adoration of the Cross\". The latter dates from ca. 830 and was not rediscovered until 1885, when Ernst Dümmler identified a text in a manuscript in Vienna as the missing \"Libellus de adoranda cruce\", which Einhard had dedicated to his pupil Lupus Servatus.\n\n\n\n"}

It replaced the old real actions and the various possessory assizes (denoting county-based pleas to local sittings of the courts) where boundary disputes often featured. Though still used in some places, the term is now obsolete in many common law jurisdictions, in which possession and title are sued by the actions of eviction (also called possession proceedings) and quiet title (or injunctive and/or declaratory relief), respectively. \n\nOriginally, successful ejectment meant recovery of possession of land, for example against a defaulting tenant or a trespasser, who did not have (or no longer had) any right to remain there. It has continued to be used for this, though in some jurisdictions the terminology has changed.\n\nThe old real actions, which were concerned with the title to land, were found to be too technical and difficult to use. A practice developed of trying the title to ownership of land by means of a special ejectment chiefly for ensuring a low court and had the added advantage of some confidentiality among the landed gentry. The claimant granted (or so professed) a lease to a friend which had passed to a fictitious person (such as John Doe), who became the nominal plaintiff: the real claimant (plaintiff) was thereby the \"lessor of the plaintiff\". The action was vicarious. The action was brought against the real defendant or, more usually, for semi-secrecy and to ensure the low court, against another fictitious person (e.g. William Styles), in many papers termed the \"casual ejector\", who both sides' papers would state evicted the first fictitious tenant(s) by virtue of an (equally fictitious) lease granted by the real defendant. The title of the action would then be \"Doe dem. [name of real claimant] v. [Defendant] or [fictitous counter-tenant]\". E.g. \"Doe dem. John Hurrell Luscombe Yates, Hawker, and Mudge (1822) 5 B. & Ald. 544\" (England; 1822),\n\nA letter was sent in the name of the casual ejector to the real defendant, inviting him to defend the case on behalf of his supposed tenant. The defendant's right to appear depended on the existence of the fictitious lease (an existence he would willingly assert). This enabled the rights of the real parties to be litigated in a low court. Such fictitious actions have been abolished in many jurisdictions as a result of the provision of alternative remedies.\n\n\n"}

It discusses the history of Europe before Charlemagne until the dawn of the age of Louis XIV, also addressing the colonies and the East.\n\nThe 174-chapter work resulted from fifteen years of research by Voltaire at Cirey-sur-Blaise, Brussels, Paris, Lunéville, Prussia, Alsace and Geneva.\n\nVoltaire revised the text until his death in 1778, expanding an Appendix with defences of the work and responses to criticism.\n\nThe \"Essai\" is a work of Enlightenment philosophy as much as of history. It urges the active rejection of superstition and fable and their replacement by knowledge based on reason. Voltaire traced common themes across various human cultures and languages, explained by a shared reality but also shared human failings, such as superstitions and dreams, that kept humans from appreciating this reality.\n\nVoltaire was reacting against Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet's \"Speech of Universal History\", which had presented Judeo-Christian nations as the most advanced. In contrast, the \"Essai\" praised ancient China and India. Voltaire also attempted to refute prejudices about the Muslim world, according to which the Ottoman Empire and all other Muslim states were despotisms in which individuals had no rights and no property of their own. He countered that these states differed among each other just as Christian states did, none of them treating subjects as slaves. He also pointed out that European feudalism gave individuals no more rights than a typical person in Turkey or Prussia.\n\nWhile arguing that Christianity was not essential for a civilised and highly moral society, Voltaire countered writers, including Pierre Bayle, who had used China as an example of a morally advanced culture based on atheism. Pointing to Chinese classic literature, including Confucius, Voltaire wrote that all societies, China included, had recognised a supreme being and used ideas of this being as a basis for morality.\n\nVoltaire credited his intellectual partner Émilie du Châtelet as an influence: the Marquise had criticised works of history that were dull lists of facts. The \"Essai\" was written to show that history could be readable and engaging so as to \"enlighten the soul\" rather than weigh it down.\n\nThe Jesuit preacher Claude-Adrien Nonnotte spent much of his life opposing the view on Christianity that Voltaire had taken in the \"Essai\". At first, he anonymously published \"Examen critique ou Réfutation du livre des moeurs\" (\"Critical examination or refutation of the book of customs\"). Over the next twenty years, he wrote a succession of revised editions of this work, which was translated into Italian, German, Polish, and Portuguese. Voltaire, in turn, responded with criticisms of Nonnotte in revised editions of the \"Essai\" and in his \"Eclaircissements historiques\" (\"Historical clarifications\").\n\nThe critic Paul Sakmann praised the \"Essai\" as \"large-scale, critically-sifted, and treated in a philosophical spirit\". Siófra Pierse in 2013 wrote that it is \"a magisterial work of compression, summary, synthesis and selectivity.\" Saul Anton in 2012 described it as \"a masterpiece of prose that pioneered many of the foundations of modern historical study and a style of historical discourse that placed the reader’s experience at the center.\"\n\n\n"}

On the evening of 20 October 1853, a wagon was taking around 40 hop-pickers and their families back to their camp site.

The Romanis were all from one extended family. The victims were aged between 59 years and 2 years old.\n\nThe inquest into the deaths was held at the Bell Inn by D N Dudlow Esq and returned a verdict of accidental death.

{"id": "43588545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43588545", "title": "Henry Quastler", "text": "Henry Quastler\n\nHenry Quastler (November 11, 1908 – July 4, 1963) was an Austrian physician and radiologist who became a pioneer in the field of information theory applied to biology after emigrating to America. His work with Sidney Dancoff led to the publication of what is now commonly called Dancoff's Law. He also developed early versions of the theory of emergence in biology.\n\nQuastler spent his early career in Vienna as a doctor. He received his medical degree in Vienna in 1932, focusing on histology and radiology. He met his wife, Gertrude Quastler, a milliner, when she came to him for treatment for tuberculosis. They married in 1933. The couple moved to Albania when King Zog asked for Quastler to train up radiologists. While there he also worked on malaria. Quastler's malaria expertise earned him a place on the International Health Board. As World War II approached in 1939, the couple left Albania and traveled to America. Within a year Quastler was working as a radiologist at New Rochelle Hospital in New York. In 1942, the Quastlers relocated to Urbana, Illinois, where Henry was employed as chief radiologist at Carle Hospital Clinic. While in Illinois, Gertrude Quastler studied art. She soon became a noted artist. Henry also painted as an amateur. According to his sister Johanna, the couple sometimes exhibited together.\n\nIn 1949 Quastler gave up his medical practice to concentrate on science. Heinz von Foerster, who knew Quastler well, said that he became even more interested in radiation after the invention of the atomic bomb, which he considered \"a horrifying human catastrophe\". Foerster recalled Questler pondering: \"[Quastler asked] 'Can I now, as a working person, find out what damage has been done by the radiation of atomic bombs?'—that was his research question. Thus he started to conduct experiments on radiation damage in living organisms.\" According to Foerster, Quastler came to information theory while trying to find a way to \"qualitatively describe the damage caused by radiation. ... Henry Quastler learned the basic concepts and formalisms of information theory with a speed that was almost unbelievable. And why? Because he needed this instrument urgently.\". \nIn the 1940s Quastler met Dancoff and collaborated with him to develop information theory in biology. They were interested in the problem of how to define the information content of a gene. After Dancoff's death, Quastler organized the symposium Information Theory in Biology, founded by him in 1952. Quastler soon became interested in how information theory could be used to understand the origin of life. In 1953 he edited \"Essays on the Use of Information Theory in Biology\". He edited another collection of essays, \"Information Theory in Psychology: Problems and Methods\", in 1956.\n\nDespite his best efforts, his wife's tuberculosis slowly worsened. A deterioration in his wife's health led Quastler to take a job at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, where he continued to work on both radiation and information biology. When his wife died in 1963, Quastler was devastated. He took an overdose of pills, laid down beside her and held her hand until he died. Richard Diebenkorn later said, \"Neither my wife nor I can think of a couple we encountered more indivisible.\" Heinz von Foerster said of Quastler that he was \"an exceptionally conscientious, ethically and morally conscious human being.\"\n\nIn Foerster's words Quastler and Dancoff attempted to answer the following problem:\n\nAccording to Lily E. Kay, Quastler and Dancoff created \"the first technical application of the Weiner-Shannon theory in genetics.\" Quastler and Dancoff proposed that the replication errors inevitable in biological reproduction must be held in check by a statistical process that functioned as a \"checking device\" within the gene. Quastler compared this to the system of \"checks and balances\" in the American constitution. The proposition known as \"Dancoff's Law\" emerged from this work. A non-mathematical statement of this law is, \"the greatest growth occurs when the greatest number of mistakes are made consistent with survival\".\n\nIn 1964 Quastler's book \"The Emergence of Biological Organization\" was published posthumously. In 2002, Harold J. Morowitz described it as a \"remarkably prescient book\" which is \"surprisingly contemporary in outlook\". In it Quastler pioneers a theory of emergence, developing model of \"a series of emergences from probionts to prokaryotes\".\n\nThe work is based on lectures given by Quastler during the spring term of 1963, when he was Visiting Professor of Theoretical Biology at Yale University. In these lectures Quastler argued that the formation of single-stranded polynucleotides was well within the limits of probability of what could have occurred during the pre-biologic period of the Earth. However, he noted that polymerization of a single-stranded polymer from mononucleotides is slow, and its hydrolysis is fast; therefore in a closed system consisting only of mononucleotides and their single-stranded polymers, only a small fraction of the available molecules will be polymerized. However, a single-stranded polymer may form a double-stranded one by complementary polymerization, using a single-stranded polynucleotide as a template. Such a process is relatively fast and the resulting double-stranded polynucleotide is much more stable than the single single-stranded one since each monomer is bound not only along the sugar phosphate backbone, but also through inter-strand bonding between the bases.\n\nThe capability for self-replication, a fundamental feature of life, emerged when double-stranded polynucleotides disassociated into single-stranded ones and each of these served as a template for synthesis of a complementary strand, producing two double-stranded copies. Such a system is mutable since random changes of individual bases may occur and be propagated. Individual replicators with different nucleotide sequences may also compete with each other for nucleotide precursors. Mutations that influence the folding state of polynucleotides may affect the ratio of association of strands to dissociation and thus the ability to replicate. The folding state would also affect the stability of the molecule. Thus Quastler speculated that a nucleic acid system is even capable, in a primitive way, of Darwinian evolution. These ideas were then developed to speculate on the emergence of genetic information, protein synthesis and other general features of life.\n\nLily E. Kay says that Quastler's works \"are an illuminating example of a well reasoned epistemic quest and a curious disciplinary failure\". Quastler's aspiration to create an information based biology was innovative, but his work was \"plagued by problems: outdated data, unwarranted assumptions, some dubious numerology, and, most importantly, an inability to generate an experimental agenda.\" However Quastler's \"discursive framework\" survived.\n\nForty-five years after Quastler's 1964 proposal, Lincoln and Joyce described a cross-catalytic system that involves two RNA enzymes (ribosymes) that catalyze each other's synthesis from a total of four component substrates. This synthesis occurred in the absence of protein and could provide the basis for an artificial genetic system.\n"}
{"id": "690194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=690194", "title": "Historia Regum Britanniae", "text": "Historia Regum Britanniae\n\nHistoria regum Britanniae (\"The History of the Kings of Britain\"), originally called De gestis Britonum (\"On the Deeds of the Britons\"), is a pseudohistorical account of British history, written around 1136 by Geoffrey of Monmouth. It chronicles the lives of the kings of the Britons over the course of two thousand years, beginning with the Trojans founding the British nation and continuing until the Anglo-Saxons assumed control of much of Britain around the 7th century. It is one of the central pieces of the Matter of Britain.\n\nAlthough taken as historical well into the 16th century, it is now considered to have no value as history. When events described, such as Julius Caesar's invasions of Britain, can be corroborated from contemporary histories, Geoffrey's account can be seen to be wildly inaccurate. It remains, however, a valuable piece of medieval literature, which contains the earliest known version of the story of King Lear and his three daughters, and helped popularise the legend of King Arthur.\n\nGeoffrey starts the book with a statement of his purpose in writing the history: \"I have not been able to discover anything at all on the kings who lived here before the Incarnation of Christ, or indeed about Arthur and all the others who followed on after the Incarnation. Yet the deeds of these men were such that they deserve to be praised for all time.\" He claims that he was given a source for this period by Archdeacon Walter of Oxford, who presented him with a \"certain very ancient book written in the British language\" from which he has translated his history. He also cites Gildas and Bede as sources. Then follows a dedication to Robert, earl of Gloucester and Waleran, count of Meulan, whom he enjoins to use their knowledge and wisdom to improve his tale.\n\nThe \"Historia\" itself begins with the Trojan Aeneas, who according to Roman legend settled in Italy after the Trojan War. His great-grandson Brutus is banished, and, after a period of wandering, is directed by the goddess Diana to settle on an island in the western ocean. Brutus lands at Totnes and names the island, then called Albion, \"Britain\" after himself. Brutus defeats the giants who are the only inhabitants of the island, and establishes his capital, Troia Nova, on the banks of the Thames; after his time it is renamed London.\n\nWhen Brutus dies, his three sons, Locrinus, Kamber and Albanactus, divide the county between themselves; the three kingdoms are named Loegria (England), Kambria (Wales) and Albany (Scotland). The story then progresses rapidly through the reigns of the descendants of Locrinus, including Bladud, who uses magic and even tries to fly, but dies in the process.\n\nBladud's son Leir reigns for sixty years. He has no sons, so upon reaching old age he decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters, Goneril, Regan and Cordelia. To decide who should get the largest share, he asks his daughters how much they love him. Goneril and Regan give extravagant answers, but Cordelia answers simply and sincerely; angered, he gives Cordelia no land. Goneril and Regan are to share half the island with their husbands, the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall. Cordelia marries Aganippus, King of the Franks, and departs for Gaul. Soon Goneril and Regan and their husbands rebel and take the whole kingdom. After Leir has had all his attendants taken from him, he begins to regret his actions towards Cordelia and travels to Gaul. Cordelia receives him compassionately and restores his royal robes and retinue. Aganippus raises a Gaulish army for Leir, who returns to Britain, defeats his sons-in-law and regains the kingdom. Leir rules for three years and then dies; Cordelia inherits the throne and rules for five years before Marganus and Cunedagius, her sisters' sons, rebel against her. They imprison Cordelia; grief-stricken, she kills herself. Marganus and Cunedagius divide the kingdom between themselves, but soon quarrel and go to war with each other. Cunedagius eventually kills Marganus in Wales and retains the whole kingdom, ruling for thirty-three years. He is succeeded by his son Rivallo.\n\nA later descendant of Cunedagius, King Gorboduc, has two sons called Ferreux and Porrex. They quarrel and both are eventually killed, sparking a civil war. This leads to Britain being ruled by five kings, who keep attacking each other. Dunvallo Molmutius, the son of Cloten, the King of Cornwall, becomes pre-eminent. He eventually defeats the other kings and establishes his rule over the whole island. He is said to have \"established the so-called Molmutine Laws which are still famous today among the English\".\n\nDunvallo's sons, Belinus and Brennius, fight a civil war before being reconciled by their mother, and proceed to sack Rome. Victorious, Brennius remains in Italy, while Belinus returns to rule Britain.\n\nNumerous brief accounts of successive kings follow. These include Lud, who renames Trinovantum \"Kaerlud\" after himself; this later becomes corrupted to London. Lud is succeeded by his brother, Cassibelanus, as Lud's sons Androgeus and Tenvantius are not yet of age. In recompense, Androgeus is made Duke of Kent and Trinovantum (London), and Tenvantius is made Duke of Cornwall.\n\nAfter his conquest of Gaul, Julius Caesar looks over the sea and resolves to order Britain to swear obedience and pay tribute to Rome. His commands are answered by a letter of refusal from Cassivellaunus. Caesar sails a fleet to Britain, but he is overwhelmed by Cassivellaunus's army and forced to retreat to Gaul. Two years later he makes another attempt, but is again pushed back. Then Cassivellaunus quarrels with one of his dukes, Androgeus, who sends a letter to Caesar asking him to help avenge the duke's honour. Caesar invades once more and besieges Cassivellaunus on a hill. After several days Cassivellaunus offers to make peace with Caesar, and Androgeus, filled with remorse, goes to Caesar to plead with him for mercy. Cassivellaunus pays tribute and makes peace with Caesar, who then returns to Gaul.\n\nCassivelaunus dies and is succeeded by his nephew Tenvantius, as Androgeus has gone to Rome. Tenvantius is succeeded in turn by his son Kymbelinus, and then Kymbelinus's son Guiderius. Guiderius refuses to pay tribute to emperor Claudius, who then invades Britain. After Guiderius is killed in battle with the Romans, his brother Arvirargus continues the defence, but eventually agrees to submit to Rome, and is given the hand of Claudius's daughter Genvissa in marriage. Claudius returns to Rome, leaving the province under Arviragus's governorship.\n\nThe line of British kings continues under Roman rule, and includes Lucius, Britain's first Christian king, and several Roman figures, including the emperor Constantine I, the usurper Allectus and the military commander Asclepiodotus. When Octavius passes the crown to his son-in-law Maximianus, his nephew Conan Meriadoc is given rule of Brittany to compensate him for not succeeding. After a long period of Roman rule, the Romans decide they no longer wish to defend the island and depart. The Britons are immediately besieged by attacks from Picts, Scots and Danes, especially as their numbers have been depleted due to Conan colonizing Brittany and Maximianus using British troops for his campaigns. In desperation the Britons send letters to the general of the Roman forces, asking for help, but receive no reply (this passage borrows heavily from the corresponding section in Gildas' \"De Excidio Britanniae\").\n\nAfter the Romans leave, the Britons ask the King of Brittany (Armorica), Aldroenus, descended from Conan, to rule them. However Aldroenus instead sends his brother Constantine to rule the Britons. After Constantine's death Vortigern assists their eldest son Constans in succeeding, before enabling their murder and coming to power. Constantine's remaining sons Aurelius Ambrosius and Uther are too young to rule and are taken to safety in Amorica. Vortigern invites the Saxons under Hengist and Horsa to fight for him as mercenaries, but they rise against him. He loses control of much of his land and encounters Merlin.\n\nAt this point Geoffrey abruptly pauses his narrative by inserting a series of prophecies attributed to Merlin. Some of the prophecies act as an epitome of upcoming chapters of the \"Historia\", while others are veiled allusions to historical people and events of the Norman world in the 11th-12th centuries. The remainder are obscure.\n\nAfter Aurelius Ambrosius defeats and kills Vortigern, becoming king, Britain remains in a state of war under him and his brother Uther. They are both assisted by the wizard Merlin. At one point during the continuous string of battles, Ambrosius takes ill and Uther must lead the army for him. This allows an enemy assassin to pose as a physician and poison Ambrosius. When the king dies, a comet taking the form of a dragon's head (pendragon) appears in the night sky, which Merlin interprets as a sign that Ambrosius is dead and that Uther will be victorious and succeed him. So after defeating his latest enemies, Uther adds \"Pendragon\" to his name and is crowned king.\n\nBut another enemy strikes, forcing Uther to make war again. This time he is temporarily defeated, gaining final victory only with the help of Duke Gorlois of Cornwall. But while celebrating this victory with Gorlois, he falls in love with the duke's wife, Igerna. This leads to war between Uther Pendragon and Gorlois of Cornwall, during which Uther clandestinely lies with Igerna through the magic of Merlin. Arthur is conceived that night. Then Gorlois is killed and Uther marries Igerna. But he must war against the Saxons again. Although Uther ultimately triumphs, he dies after drinking water from a spring the Saxons had poisoned.\n\nUther's son Arthur assumes the throne and defeats the Saxons so severely that they cease to be a threat until after his death. In the meantime, Arthur conquers most of northern Europe and ushers in a period of peace and prosperity that lasts until the Romans, led by Lucius Hiberius, demands that Britain once again pay tribute to Rome. Arthur defeats Lucius in Gaul, intending to become Emperor, but in his absence, his nephew Mordred seduces and marries Guinevere and seizes the throne.\n\nArthur returns and kills Mordred at the Battle of Camlann, but, mortally wounded, he is carried off to the isle of Avalon, and hands the kingdom to his cousin Constantine, son of Cador and Duke of Cornwall.\n\nThe Saxons returned after Arthur's death, but would not end the line of British kings until the death of Cadwallader. Cadwallader is forced to flee Britain and requests the aid of King Alan of the Amoricans. However an angel's voice tells him the Britons will no longer rule and he should go to Rome. Cadwallader does so, dying there, though leaves his son and nephew to rule the remaining Britons. The remaining Britons are driven into Wales and the Saxon Athelstan becomes King of Loegria.\n\nGeoffrey claimed to have translated the \"Historia\" into Latin from \"a very ancient book in the British tongue\", given to him by Walter, Archdeacon of Oxford. However, no modern scholars take this claim seriously. Much of the work appears to be derived from Gildas's 6th-century polemic \"The Ruin of Britain\", Bede's 8th-century \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\", the 9th-century \"History of the Britons\" ascribed to Nennius, the 10th-century \"Welsh Annals\", medieval Welsh genealogies (such as the Harleian Genealogies) and king-lists, the poems of Taliesin, the Welsh tale \"Culhwch and Olwen\", and some of the medieval Welsh saints' lives, expanded and turned into a continuous narrative by Geoffrey's own imagination.\n\nIn an exchange of manuscript material for their own histories, Robert of Torigny gave Henry of Huntington a copy of \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", which both Robert and Henry used uncritically as authentic history and subsequently used in their own works, by which means some of Geoffrey's fictions became embedded in popular history. The history of Geoffrey forms the basis for much British lore and literature as well as being a rich source of material for Welsh bards. It became tremendously popular during the High Middle Ages, revolutionising views of British history before and during the Anglo-Saxon period despite the criticism of such writers as William of Newburgh and Gerald of Wales. The prophecies of Merlin in particular were often drawn on in later periods, for instance by both sides in the issue of English influence over Scotland under Edward I and his successors.\n\nThe \"Historia\" was quickly translated into Norman verse by Wace (the \"Roman de Brut\") in 1155. Wace's version was in turn translated into Middle English verse by Layamon (the \"Brut\") in the early 13th century. In the second quarter of the 13th century, a version in Latin verse, the \"Gesta Regum Britanniae\", was produced by William of Rennes. Material from Geoffrey was incorporated into a large variety of Anglo-Norman and Middle English prose compilations of historical material from the 13th century onward.\n\nGeoffrey was translated into a number of different Welsh prose versions by the end of the 13th century, collectively known as \"Brut y Brenhinedd\". One variant of the \"Brut y Brenhinedd\", the so-called \"Brut Tysilio\", was proposed in 1917 by the archaeologist William Flinders Petrie to be the ancient British book that Geoffrey translated, although the \"Brut\" itself claims to have been translated from Latin by Walter of Oxford, based on his own earlier translation from Welsh to Latin. Geoffrey's work is greatly important because it brought the Welsh culture into British society and made it acceptable. It is also the first record we have of the great figure King Lear, and the beginning of the mythical King Arthur figure. \n\nFor many centuries, the \"Historia\" was accepted at face value, and much of its material was incorporated into Holinshed's 16th-century \"Chronicles\".\n\nModern historians have regarded the \"Historia\" as a work of fiction with some factual information contained within. John Morris in \"The Age of Arthur\" calls it a \"deliberate spoof\", although this is based on misidentifying Walter, archdeacon of Oxford, as Walter Map, a satirical writer who lived a century later.\n\nIt continues to have an influence on popular culture, e.g. Mary Stewart's \"Merlin Trilogy\" and the TV miniseries \"Merlin\" both contain large elements taken from the \"Historia\".\n\nTwo hundred and fifteen medieval manuscripts of the \"Historia\" survive, dozens of them copied before the end of the 12th century. Even among the earliest manuscripts a large number of textual variants, such as the so-called \"First Variant\", can be discerned. These are reflected in the three possible prefaces to the work and in the presence or absence of certain episodes and phrases. Certain variants may be due to \"authorial\" additions to different early copies, but most probably reflect early attempts to alter, add to or edit the text. Unfortunately, the task of disentangling these variants and establishing Geoffrey's original text is long and complex, and the extent of the difficulties surrounding the text has been established only recently.\n\nThe variant title \"Historia regum Britaniae\" was introduced in the Middle Ages, and this became the most common form in the modern period. A critical edition of the work published in 2007, however, demonstrated that the most accurate manuscripts refer to the work as \"De gestis Britonum\", and that this was the title Geoffrey himself used to refer to the work.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7203644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7203644", "title": "History of waste management", "text": "History of waste management\n\nThroughout history, waste has been generated by humans. In areas with low population density waste generation may have been negligible. In higher population areas even largely biodegradable waste had to be dealt with. Sometimes this was released back into the ground water with environmental impact like Nor Loch. The Maya of Central America had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their garbage in large dumps.\n\nFollowing the onset of industrialization and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in England, the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of sanitation and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations. Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers were mooted as early as 1751 by Corbyn Morris in London, who proposed that \"...as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance, it is proposed that the cleaning of this city, should be put under one uniform public management, and all the filth be...conveyed by the Thames to proper distance in the country\".\n\nThe first occurrence of organised solid waste management system appeared in London in the late 18th century. A waste collection and resource recovery system was established around the 'dust-yards'. Main constituent of municipal waste was the coal ash (‘dust’) which had a market value for brick-making and as a soil improver. Such profitability encouraged dust-contractors to recover effectively 100% of the residual wastes remaining after readily saleable items and materials had been removed by the informal sector in the streets ('rag-and-bone men'). Therefore, this was an early example of organised, municipal-wide solid waste management. The dust-yard system had been working successfully up to middle 1850s, when the market value of ‘dust’ collapsed. It was important in facilitating a relatively smooth transition to an institutionalised, municipally-run solid waste management system in England.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating cholera outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first consolidated legislation on the issue emerged. Highly influential in this new focus was the report \"The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population\" in 1842 of the social reformer, Edwin Chadwick, in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city's population. Chadwick's proposals were based on the miasmatic theory of disease transmission, which was proven to be false following the turn of the 1900s.\n\nThe Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London. The Metropolitan Board of Works was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the Public Health Act 1875 made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in 'moveable receptacles' for disposal - the first concept for a dust-bin.\nThe dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first incineration plants, or, as they were then called, 'destructors'. In 1874, the first incinerator was built in Nottingham by Manlove, Alliott & Co. Ltd. to the design of Alfred Fryer. However, these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas.\n\nSimilar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of Europe and North America. In 1895, New York City became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.\n\nEarly garbage removal trucks were simply open bodied dump trucks pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first close body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain. These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The Garwood Load Packer was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.\n\nIn the 19th century, in the United States, cities often became choked with horse manure. While the odor was tolerable to 19th century sensitivities, walking through the streets without boots, resulted in deplorable appearing footwear. In many cities, lacking trash collection, pigs and dogs ran loose, consuming the trash, but excreting dung, which smelled offensively. Dead animals, particularly horses, were left lying in the streets, facilitating disease.\n\n"}
{"id": "58603502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58603502", "title": "Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph", "text": "Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph\n\nThe Ivanhorod Einsatzgruppen photograph is an image of the Holocaust, showing a soldier aiming a rifle at a woman who is trying to shield a child with her body. It depicts the murder of Jews by an \"Einsatzgruppen\" death squad near Ivanhorod, Ukraine in 1942. The photograph was mailed, intercepted by the Polish resistance in Warsaw, and kept by Jerzy Tomaszewski. In the 1960s, it was alleged that the image was a Communist forgery, but that claim was debunked. Since then, the photograph has been frequently used in books, museums, and exhibitions relating to the Holocaust. Photograph historian Janina Struk describes it as \"a symbol of the barbarity of the Nazi regime and their industrial scale murder of 11 million people including 6 million European Jews\".\n\nDuring the Holocaust, more than a million Jews were murdered in Ukraine. Most of them were shot in mass executions by \"Einsatzgruppen\" (death squads) and Ukrainian collaborators. In 1897, the Russian Empire Census found that there were 442 Jews (out of a population of 3,032) living in Ivanhorod, a village in the Cherkasy Oblast in central Ukraine. In 1942, a mass shooting by \"Einsatzgruppen\" south of the town killed an unknown number of victims. Part of the massacre is depicted in this photograph. After the war, the execution site was used as a field of a collective farm.\n\nThere are six victims in the photograph. The body lying at the feet of the German soldier appears to be a woman who was already shot. In the center of the photograph is a woman who appears to be shielding a child. One of her feet is raised as if she is trying to flee, or else the photograph was taken just after she was shot. To her right are four men. Only one soldier is fully visible in the picture; he appears to be aiming at the men. Rifles held by German soldiers off the left edge of the photograph are visible and point at the woman and child. The shadows at the left edge of the photograph suggest that more German soldiers may be present. A wooden stake and a shovel are visible on the right side of the photo. Robert Fisk hypothesized that the victims may have been ordered to dig their own graves before being shot.\n\nThe identity of the photographer is unknown, but he was probably a German soldier. Many German soldiers photographed atrocities in which they were complicit.\n\nThe Polish resistance infiltrated the postal office in Warsaw in order to intercept sensitive correspondence, which they sent to the Polish government-in-exile in London. Poles and Jews were forbidden to own cameras, but the Polish resistance established underground workshops for developing clandestine photographs of Nazi atrocities. A teenage boy named Jerzy Tomaszewski worked with an underground lab called \"Foto-Rys\", and he intercepted a photograph with the words \"Ukraine 1942, Judenaktion [Jewish Action], Iwangorod [Ivanhorod]\" written on the reverse. He kept the original, which remains in his personal archive; a copy was sent to the government-in-exile in London.\n\nThe photograph was first published in Poland in 1959 by the Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy on the cover of a book of photographs entitled \"1939–1945. We have not forgotten / Nous n'avons pas oublié / Wir haben es nicht vergessen\". Tomaszewski worked as one of the editors, although he knew that the book was using the photographs for Communist propaganda; he supported the publication because there was no other way to print the photographs. Many publications crop the image to the one soldier, the woman, and the child. Fisk criticized this presentation, arguing that it makes the image more aesthetically appealing at the expense of historical accuracy. Conversely, photography historian Janina Struk states that cropping the image omits \"the less emotional and more confusing parts of the picture\". \n\nSince then, the Ivanhorod photograph has been reproduced in many books, museums, and exhibitions relating to the Holocaust. In her book \"Reading the Holocaust\", it was described by Inga Clendinnen as \"iconic in its distillation of German atrocity\". According to Fisk, the photograph is \"one of the most impressive and persuasive images of the Nazi Holocaust\". Struk stated that it \"has become a symbol of the barbarity of the Nazi regime and of the murder of 6 million European Jews\".\n\nThe German newspaper \"Deutsche Soldaten Zeitung\" (DSZ, \"German Soldiers' Newspaper\") printed an allegation on 26 January 1962 by Professor Otto Croy, known for his writings on photographic technique, under the title \"Achtung Fälschungen\" (\"Beware Fakes\"). Croy claimed that the photograph had been fabricated by Communist authorities in Poland in order to falsely accuse Germany of war crimes; he alleged that the image did not depict a German soldier and that the weapons and uniforms were not authentic. Before publishing the book, German publishing house Verlag Kurt Desch had verified the authenticity of the image by writing to Roman Karsk, professor of German literature at the University of Warsaw, and he replied that it was a faithful copy of an image held by the historical archives in Warsaw depicting 1942 mass shootings.\n\nIn response to the allegations, Tomaszewski and Tadeusz Mazur (one of the editors of \"1939–1945 We have not forgotten\") published another image from the same source in the Polish magazine \"Świat\" on 25 February. The second image depicted five armed men, one in civilian clothes and the other four in uniform, standing and looking at the camera over a pile of corpses. It bore several similarities to the better-known photograph, but lacked the \"dramatic impact\", according to Struk. The flat, barren terrain was identical; one of the men bore a strong resemblance to a soldier in the previous photograph; and the words \"Ukraine 1942\" had been written on the back of the image in the same handwriting. In the article, Tomaszewski described the DSZ as a supporter of the Third Reich and accused the paper of \"revisionism\". \n\nThe allegations continued to be recirculated in the German press for more than two years, in what Tomaszewski described as a \"press war\". The Polish government was concerned about a potential diplomatic incident if the image was in fact a falsification, and they sent officials to Tomaszewski's home to inspect the image. In 1965, \"Der Spiegel\" published a letter from Kurt Vieweg, a former member of a German police battalion stationed in Norway, and he confirmed that the weapons and uniforms matched those used by his unit and those of the \"Einsatzgruppen\".\n"}

{"id": "45678306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45678306", "title": "Magnus Sinus", "text": "Magnus Sinus\n\nThe Magnus Sinus or Sinus Magnus (Latin; , \"o Mégas Kólpos\"), also anglicized as the was the form of the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea known to Greek, Roman, Arab, Persian, and Renaissance cartographers before the Age of Discovery. It was then briefly conflated with the Pacific Ocean before disappearing from maps.\n\nThe gulf and its major port of Cattigara had supposedly been reached by a 1st-century Greek trader named Alexander, who returned safely and left a periplus of his voyage. His account that Cattigara was \"some days\" sail from Zaba was taken by Marinus of Tyre to mean \"numberless\" days and by Ptolemy to mean \"a few\". Both Alexander and Marinus's works have been lost, but were claimed as authorities by Ptolemy in his \"Geography\". Ptolemy (and presumably Marinus before him) followed Hipparchus in making the Indian Ocean a landlocked sea, placing Cattigara on its unknown eastern shoreline. The expanse formed between it and the Malay Peninsula (the \"Golden Chersonese\"), he called the Great Gulf.\nPtolemy's \"Geography\" was translated into Arabic by a team of scholars including al-Khwārizmī in the 9th century during the reign of al-Maʿmūn. By that time, Arab merchants such as Soleiman had begun regular commerce with Tang China and, having passed through the Strait of Malacca \"en route\", shown that the Indian Sea communicated with the open ocean. African traders similarly showed that the coastline did not turn sharply east south of Cape Prasum below Zanzibar as Ptolemy held. Al-Khwārizmī's influential \"Book of the Description of the Earth\", therefore, removed Ptolemy's unknown shores from the Indian Ocean. The robustly-described lands east of the Great Gulf, however, were retained as a phantom peninsula (now generally known as the Dragon's Tail).\n\nJust after 1295, Maximus Planudes restored Ptolemy's Greek text and maps at Chora Monastery in Constantinople (Istanbul). This was translated into Latin at Florence by Jacobus Angelus around 1406 and quickly spread the work's information and misinformation throughout Western Europe. The maps initially repeated Ptolemy's enclosed Indian Sea. Following word of Bartholomew Dias's circumnavigation of Africa, maps by Martellus and by Martin of Bohemia replaced this with a new form of the Dragon's Tail peninsula, including details from Marco Polo. As early as 1540, continuing exploration led Sebastian Münster to conflate the Great Gulf with the Pacific Ocean west of the Americas, supposing that the 1st-century Alexander had crossed to a port in Peru and safely returned. The idea was repeated by Ortelius and others. (Some modern South American scholars have returned to the idea as recently as the 1990s, but there remains no substantial evidence to support the idea.) The Great Gulf was finally dispensed with in all its forms as more accurate accounts returned from both the East and West Indies.\n\nThe details of the Great Gulf changed somewhat among its various forms, but the ancient and Renaissance Ptolemaic accounts had it bound on the west by the Golden Chersonese and on the north and east by the ports of the Sinae, chief among which was Cattigara. Medieval Islamic cartographers followed al-Khwārizmī in having a strait southeast of the gulf communicating with the Sea of Darkness. Believing the circumference of the Earth to follow Ptolemy's reduced figures or even smaller ones, cartographers during the early phases of the Age of Discovery expanded the Gulf to form the Pacific Ocean west of South America, considered to represent a southeastern peninsula of Asia.\n\nModern reconstructions agree in naming the Golden Chersonese a form of the Malaysian Peninsula but differ in their considerations of how much of the South China Sea to include within Ptolemy's reckoning of the Great Gulf. Those following Alexander's route from Zaba on its northern shore to Cattigara to its southeast consider it to be no more than the Gulf of Thailand, with Cattigara located in the Funanese Óc Eo ruins at Thoại Sơn. Its Cottiaris River would then be a former course of the Mekong which once passed the site to enter the Gulf of Thailand. Others ignoring the route as garbled but taking Cattigara to be the major Han entrepôt of Longbian consider the Great Gulf to have been the Gulf of Tonkin, hypothesizing that the Gulf of Thailand (if present) was represented by the smaller inlet on the eastern shore of the Golden Chersonese. Its Cottiaris River would have been Vietnam's Red River. Panyu (Guangzhou) had been the major port of the Kingdom of Nanyue but identifications of Ptolemy's Cattigara with Han-era Nanhai, though common in the past, are credited little more than those placing it in Peru.\n\n"}

{"id": "51135264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51135264", "title": "Mosaic of Rehob", "text": "Mosaic of Rehob\n\nThe Mosaic of Reḥob (also known as the Tel Rehov inscription and Baraita of the Boundaries) is a mosaic discovered in 1973, inlaid in the floor of the foyer or narthex of an ancient synagogue near Tel Rehov, south of Beit She'an and about west of the Jordan River, containing the longest written text hitherto discovered in any mosaic in the Land of Israel, and also the oldest known Talmudic text.\n\nUnlike other mosaics found in the region, the Reḥob mosaic has very little in the form of ornate design and symmetric patterns, but is unique due to its inscription, acclaimed by scholars to be one of the most important epigraphical findings discovered in Israel in the last century. Its text sheds invaluable light on the historical geography (toponymy) of Palestine during the Roman and late-Byzantine periods, as well as on Jewish and non-Jewish ethnographic divisions in Palestine for the same periods and their relation to one another, specifically, on agricultural produce cultivated by farmers, and the extent of Jewish law regulating the use of such farm products grown in the region of Beit Shean (Scythopolis) and the Jordan valley, Sussitha (Hippos) and its neighboring cities on the east bank of the Sea of Galilee, Naveh (Nawā) in the Roman province of Arabia Petraea, Tyre and its neighboring cities to the south, as well as towns in the vicinity of Sebaste and Caesarea, and Ashqelon to the south. By delineating the boundaries of the Land of Israel, it seeks to establish the legal status of the country in its various parts from the time of Israel's return from the Babylonian captivity, and whether or not local farm products acquired by Jews from other Jews, or from gentiles and Samaritans, are exempt or obligated in what concerns the laws of Seventh Year produce, and of \"demai\"-produce. The mosaic also describes different kinds of fruits and vegetables that were cultivated in the country at the time.\n\nThe site of the ancient synagogue was first discovered by members of Kibbutz Ein HaNetziv while preparing their lands for cultivation in the late 1960s, lands that had belonged to the villagers of Farwana before 1948. An archaeological excavation of the site in 1973, led by a team under IAA Fanny Vitto, revealed the mosaic and its content, which is now on display at the Israel Museum.\n\nThe mosaic pieces are made of black limestone tesserae contrasted against a white background, measuring , with an accompanying text written on 29 lines, comprising a total of 350 words, with an average length of to each line. It begins with the salutation, \"Shalom\" – Peace!, followed by a long halakhic text, and ends with the salutation, \"Shalom,\" followed by an appendix where it lists some eighteen towns in the vicinity of Sebaste (the ancient city of Samaria) whose fruits and vegetables were exempt from tithes and the stringencies applied to Seventh Year produce. There is little uniformity in the size of the letters, while the spelling of some words is faulty. Portions of the main text contain elements that are related to late second-century rabbinic literature, particularly that found in the Tosefta (\"Shevi'it\" 4:8–11), the Jerusalem Talmud (\"Demai\" 2:1; \"Shevi'it\" 6:1) and Sifrei on Deuteronomy 11:24, although the mosaic of Reḥob expands on aspects of each. The more ancient text in the Reḥob mosaic has been used to correct errors in transmission of extant rabbinic texts.\n\nThe text in the Reḥob mosaic can only be understood in the context of Jewish law at the time, which required the tithing of agricultural produce six years out of a seven-year cycle, as well as the observance of Seventh Year law strictures on the same produce once in every seven years. This, too, was contingent upon lands that had been settled by returning Jews from the Babylonian captivity. The underlying principle in Jewish law states that when the Jewish exiles returned from the Babylonian captivity in the 4th century BCE, the extent of territories resettled by them in Galilee and in Judea did not equal nor exceed the territory originally conquered by Israel at the time of Joshua, more commonly referred to as \"those who came-up from Egypt.\" The practical bearing of this restructuring of boundaries (although still part of the biblical Land of Israel proper) meant that places then settled by non-Jewish residents in the land (whether Phoenicians, Syrians, Grecians, or otherwise) and not taken by Israel were not deemed as consecrated land and, therefore, fruits and vegetables grown in such places and purchased by Jews were exempt from the laws of tithing, and of Seventh Year restrictions. However, if fruits and vegetables were purchased by gentile vendors from Israelites in their respective places and transported into these non-consecrated places in order to be sold in the marketplaces, they were still made subject to tithing as \"demai\"-produce by prospective Jewish buyers. The fruits and vegetables mentioned in the Reḥob mosaic with respect to Beit She'an (as detailed in the Jerusalem Talmud) were not locally grown in Beit She'an, but were transported there from places settled by Israel. Beit She'an was a frontier city along the country's eastern front with Transjordan, and since it was not initially settled by Israelites upon their return from Babylon, although later Israelites had joined the local inhabitants, all home-grown fruits and vegetables there were made exempt from tithing in the days of Rabbi Judah HaNasi.\n\nThe maritime city of Akko (Ptolemais), and the river south of Achziv (Chezib), a small coastal town ca. north of Acre, according to the Mishnah (\"Demai\" 1:3 and \"Gittin\" 1:2), were the extent of the northern boundary settled by Jews returning from the Babylonian captivity in the days of Ezra. Produce locally grown in the country beyond Achziv was exempt from the rules of \"demai\"-produce. Although the towns and villages (in what follows here) were traditionally outside of the territorial bounds occupied by Jews returning from Babylonia, still, these cities attracted Jewish settlement. In addition, fruits and vegetables grown in the Land of Israel were often transported northward, along the route known as the Promontory of Tyre (Heb. סולמות של צור). Israelites who frequented these areas, or who had moved there, were likely to buy fruits that had not been properly tithed in Israel. The emphasis on the regulation of agricultural produce obtained by Israel in the following northern areas, or, as the Rehob inscription says, \"what an Israelite has purchased\" in those parts, was because of its doubtful nature.\n\nThe following frontier cities once marked the boundary of the Land of Israel, or the extent of places repopulated after the return from Babylonian exile. In a broader sense, the list of frontier towns and villages herein named represent the geographical limits of regulations imposed upon all agricultural produce, making them fully liable to tithing and to sabbatical-year restrictions within that same border, or, in the event of being purchased from the common people of the land, to separate therefrom only the \"demai\"-tithe. As one moved further east of Achziv, the border extended northward, into what are now portions of south Lebanon, and as far east as places in the present-day Kingdom of Jordan. While the settlements here named reflect a historical reality, bearing heavily on Jewish legal law (Halacha), they did not always reflect a political reality, insofar that the political borders have since changed owing to a long history of occupiers and conquerors.\n\nThe maritime city of Caesarea Maritima was an enclave along the Mediterranean coast not immediately settled by Jewish émigrés returning from the Babylonian exile. Later, however, Jews joined the inhabitants of the city, yet, by the 1st century CE, it was still principally settled by foreigners, mostly Grecians. To ease the strictures placed upon the poor of the Jewish nation during the Seventh Year (since planting was prohibited throughout that year, and after-growths could not be taken by the people), Rabbi Judah HaNasi (2nd century CE) found the juridical legitimacy to release the city (and its bounds) from the obligation of tithing locally-grown produce, and from the restrictions associated with Seventh Year produce. Notwithstanding, on certain fruits and on one commodity spice (see \"infra\".), they still required the separation of the \"demai\" tithe because of the majority of these specific items being transported into Caesarea from other places of the country held by Israel. However, during the Seventh Year, since these items were usually not harvested or worked by Jews in that year, the majority of such produce were esteemed as such that had been harvested and worked by the gentiles of that place and who are not obligated in the laws of the Seventh Year. This, therefore, made it permissible unto Jews to purchase from them such items.\nBetween the country of Judea and the country of Galilee lies an intermediate stretch of land known as \"the strip of the Samaritans.\" Jews often passed through the region, while \"en route\" from Galilee to Jerusalem during the three annual pilgrimages, and again when returning home.\n\nAlthough the region of Samaria was not seized at the very outset by those Jews returning from the Babylonian exile, the priests of Aaron's descent were still permitted to pass through their country, without fear of contracting defilement in respect to the country of the gentiles. Nonetheless, with respect to fruits and vegetables had in Samaria, there were some places in Samaria that were exempt from tithes, as if they had been a foreign land.\n\nThe Jerusalem Talmud, when speaking about the impropriety of leaving the Land of Israel, describes the standard rule of practice of the time: \"Said Rabbi Abbahu: 'There are hamlets belonging to the Samaritans wherein it has been customary to permit [a Jew's passage through them], since the days of Joshua, the son of Nun, and they are permitted' (i.e. released from the laws requiring tithing of produce).\" The reason for this exemption is explained by Talmudic exegete, Solomon Sirilio, as being that these villages in Samaria and their suburbs had the status of feudal or usufruct lands given by grant from the State to farm-laborers for a share of its increase, while the majority of increase accrued unto the State. This was enough to exempt such produce from the requirement of tithing, since the kingdom (Ptolemaic or Roman, or otherwise) had not forfeited its hold over such lands, and since the Jewish regulations for tithing prescribe that produce or grain that is to be tithed must be the property of its tither, in accordance with Deuteronomy 14:22, \"…you shall tithe all the produce of your seed\" – meaning, \"your\" seed, but not the seed belonging to others. The following list of towns concerns those hamlets held by the State (kingdom) in the region of Sebaste (the biblical city of Samaria) and which were, therefore, exempt from the laws of tithing. The list is not known from any other source, and is only alluded to in the Jerusalem Talmud.\n\nBy this it is implied that other towns and villages that were settled by the Samaritans, such as Gebaʻ and Badan, fruits grown therein were still under the obligation to have all tithes separated therefrom before they could be eaten.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10933466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10933466", "title": "Oba (ruler)", "text": "Oba (ruler)\n\nOba means ruler in the Yoruba and Bini languages of contemporary West Africa. Kings in Yorubaland, a region which is in the modern republics of Benin, Nigeria and Togo, make use of it as a pre-nominal honorific. Post-colonial examples of Yoruba bearers include Oba Ogunwusi of Ile Ife, Oba Aromolaran of Ilesha and Oba Adeyemi of Oyo. An example of a Bini bearer is Oba Ewuare II of Benin.\n\nThe title is distinct from that of Oloye, which is used in like fashion by subordinate titleholders in the Yoruba chieftaincy system.\n\nThe Yoruba chieftaincy system can be divided into four separate ranks: royal chiefs, noble chiefs, religious chiefs and common chiefs. The royals are led by the obas, who sit at the apex of the hierarchy and serve as the fons honorum of the entire system. They are joined in the class of royal chiefs by the titled dynasts of their royal families. The three other ranks, who traditionally provide the membership of a series of privy councils, sects and guilds, oversee the day-to-day administration of the Yoruba traditional states and are led by the Iwarefas, the Arabas and the titled elders of the kingdoms' constituent families.\n\nThere are two different kinds of Yoruba monarchs: The kings of Yoruba clans, which are often simply networks of related towns (For example, the Oba of the Egba bears the title \"Alake of Egbaland\" because his ancestral seat is the Ake quarter of Abeokuta, hence the title Alake, which is Yoruba for \"Man of Ake\". The Oyo oba, meanwhile, bears the title \"Alaafin\", which means \"Man of the palace\") and the kings of individual Yoruba towns, such as that of Iwo - a town in Osun State - who bears the title \"Olu'wo\" (Olu of Iwo, lit. \"Lord of Iwo\").\n\nThe first generation towns of the Yoruba homeland, which encompasses large swathes of the said countries of Benin, Nigeria, and Togo, are those with obas who generally wear beaded crowns; the rulers of many of the 'second generation' settlements are also often obas. Those that remain and those of the third generation tend to only be headed by the holders of the title \"Baale\" (lit. \"Head of the Clan\"), who do not wear crowns and who are, at least in theory, the reigning viceroys of people who do.\n\nAll of the subordinate members of the Yoruba aristocracy, both traditional titleholders and honorary ones, use the pre-nominal \"Oloye\" (lit. \"Owner of a title\", also appearing as \"Ijoye\") in the way that kings and queens regnant use 'Oba'. It is also often used by princes and princesses in colloquial situations, though the title that is most often ascribed to them officially is \"Omoba\" (lit. \"Child of a Monarch\", sometimes rendered alternatively as \"Omo'ba\", \"Omooba\" and \"Omo-Oba\"). The wives of kings, princes and chiefs of royal background usually make use of the title \"Olori\" (the equivalent of \"Princess Consort\", otherwise spelled \"Oloori\"), though some of the wives of dynastic rulers prefer to be referred to as \"Ayaba\" (the equivalent of \"Queen Consort\"). The wives of the non-royal chiefs, when themselves titleholders in their own right, tend to use the honorific \"Iyaloye\" (lit. \"Lady who owns a title\") in their capacities as married chieftesses.\n\nThe bead-embroidered crown with beaded veil, foremost attribute of the oba, symbolizes the aspirations of a civilization at the highest level of authority. In his seminal article on the topic, Robert F. Thompson writes, \"The crown incarnates the intuition of royal ancestral force, the revelation of great moral insight in the person of the king, and the glitter of aesthetic experience.\"\n\nThe role of the oba has diminished with the coming of colonial and democratic institutions. However, an event that still has symbolic prestige and capital is that of chieftaincy title-taking and awarding. This dates back to the era of the Oyo warrior chiefs and palace officials in the medieval period, when powerful individuals of varied ancestries held prominent titles in the empire. In Yorubaland, like in many other areas of Benin, Nigeria and Togo, chieftaincy titles are mostly given to successful men and women from within a given sub-sectional territory, although it is not unheard of for a person from elsewhere to receive one. The titles also act as symbolic capital that can be used to gain favour when desired by the individual oba that awarded them, and sometimes vice versa. During any of the traditional investiture ceremonies for the chiefs-designate, the oba is regarded by the Yoruba as the major center of attention, taking precedence over even the members of the official governments of any of the three countries if they are present. As he leads the procession of nominees into a specially embroidered dais in front of a wider audience of guests and well wishers, festivities of varied sorts occur to the accompaniment of traditional drumming. Emblems are given out according to seniority, and drapery worn by the oba and chiefs are created to be elaborate and also expensive. Most of the activities are covered by the local media and enter the public domain thereafter. Only the secret initiations for traditional chiefs of the highest rank are kept secret from all outsiders. Ceremonies such as this, and the process of selection and maintenance of networks of chiefs, are two of the major sources of power for the contemporary royals of West Africa.\n\nAs a sacred ruler, the oba is traditionally regarded by the Yoruba as the ex officio chief priest of all of the Orisha sects in his or her domain. Although most of the day-to-day functions of this position are delegated in practice to such figures as the Arabas, certain traditional rites of the Yoruba religion can only be performed by the oba, and it is for this reason that the holders of the title are often thought of as being religious leaders in addition to being politico-ceremonial monarchs.\n\n"}

{"id": "14644187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14644187", "title": "Propaganda during the Yugoslav Wars", "text": "Propaganda during the Yugoslav Wars\n\nDuring the Yugoslav Wars, propaganda was widely used in the media of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia, and in Bosnian media.\n\nIn the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), one of the indictments against Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević was his use of the Serbian state-run mass media to create an atmosphere of fear and hatred among Yugoslavia's Orthodox Serbs by spreading \"exaggerated and false messages of ethnically based attacks by Bosnian Muslims and Catholic Croats against the Serb people...\"\nSlobodan Milošević began his efforts to gain control over the media in 1986-87, a process which was complete by the summer of 1991. In 1992 Radio Television Belgrade, together with Radio Television Novi Sad (RTNS) and Radio Television Pristina (RTP) became a part of Radio Television of Serbia, a centralized and closely governed network intended to be a loudspeaker for Milošević's policies. During the 1990s, \"Dnevnik\" (Daily news) was used to glorify the \"wise politics of Slobodan Milošević\" and to attack \"the servants of Western powers and the forces of chaos and despair\", i.e., the Serbian opposition.\n\nAccording to Professor Renaud De la Brosse, Senior Lecturer at the University of Reims, a witness called by the ICTY's Office of the Prosecutor, Serbian authorities used media as a weapon in their military campaign. \"In Serbia specifically, the use of media for nationalist ends and objectives formed part of a well thought through plan - itself part of a strategy of conquest and affirmation of identity.\" According to de la Bosse, nationalist ideology defined the Serbs partly according to a historical myth, based on the defeat of Serbia by the Ottoman forces at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 and partly on the genocide committed against Serbs during the Second World War at the hands of the Croatian extremists that were governing the Independent State of Croatia. The Croatian will for independence fed the flames of fear, especially in Serb majority regions of Croatia. According to de la Bosse, the new Serbian identity became one in opposition to the \"others\" - Croats (collapsed into \"Ustashe\") and Muslims (collapsed into \"Turks\"). Even Croatian democracy was dismissed since ‘Hitler came to power in Germany within the framework of a multi-party mechanism but subsequently became a great dictator, aggressor and criminal’\n\nWhile Milošević, until the run up to the Kosovo War, allowed independent print media to publish, their distribution was limited. His methods of controlling the media included creating shortages of paper, interfering with or stopping supplies and equipment, confiscating newspapers for being printed without proper licenses, etc. For publicly owned media, he could dismiss, promote, demote or have journalists publicly condemned. In 1998, he adopted a media law which created a special misdemeanor court to try violations. It had the ability to impose heavy fines and to confiscate property if they were not immediately paid.\nAccording to the report by de la Brosse, the Milošević-controlled media reached more than 3.5 million people every day. Given that and the lack of access to alternative news, de la Brosse states that it is surprising how great the resistance to Milošević's propaganda was among Serbs - evidenced not only in massive demonstrations in Serbia in 1991 and 1996-97 both of which almost toppled the regime, but also widespread draft resistance and desertion from the military.\n\nDe la Brosse describes how RTS (Radio Television of Serbia) portrayed events in Dubrovnik and Sarajevo: \"The images shown of Dubrovnik came with a commentary accusing those from the West who had taken the film of manipulation and of having had a tire burnt in front of their cameras to make it seem that the city was on fire. As for the shells fired at Sarajevo and the damage caused, for several months it was simply as if it had never happened in the eyes of Serbian television viewers because Belgrade television would show pictures of the city taken months and even years beforehand to deny that it had ever occurred.\" The Serbian public was fed similar disinformation about Vukovar, according to former Reuters correspondent Daniel Deluce, \"Serbian Radio Television created a strange universe in which Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, had never been besieged and in which the devastated Croatian town of Vukovar had been 'liberated'.\"\n\nICTY sentencing judgement for Milan Babić which has been first president of Republic of Serbian Krajina, a self-proclaimed Serbian dominated entity within Croatia will declare:\n\nŽeljko Kopanja, the editor of the independent newspaper \"Nezavisne Novine\", was seriously hurt by a car bomb after publishing stories detailing atrocities committed by Serbs against Bosniaks during the Bosnian War. He believed that the bomb was planted by Serbia's security services to stop him from publishing further stories. An FBI investigation supported his suspicions.\n\nDuring the Pakrac clash, Serbian newspaper \"Večernje Novosti\" reported that about 40 Serb civilians were killed in Pakrac on 2 March 1991 by the Croatian forces. The story was widely accepted by the public and some ministers in the Serbian government (e.g. Dragutin Zelenović). Attempts to confirm the report in other media from all 7 municipalities with the name Pakrac throughout the former Yugoslavia failed.\n\nA day before the execution of 264 Croatian prisoners of war and civilians in the Ovčara massacre, Serbian media reported that 40 Serb babies had been killed in Vukovar. Dr. Vesna Bosanac, the head of Vukovar hospital from which the Croatian POW's and civilians were taken, said she believed the story of slaughtered babies was released intentionally to incite Serb nationalists to execute Croats.\n\nBefore the Siege of Dubrovnik, JNA officers (namely Pavle Strugar) made a concerted effort at misrepresenting the military situation on the ground and exaggerated the \"threat\" of a Croatian attack on Montenegro by \"30,000 armed Ustaše and 7000 terrorists, including Kurdish mercenaries\". This propaganda was widely spread by the state-controlled media of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nIn reality, Croatian military forces at the area in September were virtually non-existent. The Croat forces consisted of just one locally conscripted unit, which numbered less than 1,500 men and had no tanks or heavy guns. Also, there were no mercenaries, Kurdish or otherwise, on the Croat side.\n\nDuring the Siege of Dubrovnik in 1991, while the Yugoslav Army shelled the Croatian port town, Radio Television of Serbia showed Dubrovnik with columns of smoke claiming that the local people were burning automobile tires to simulate the destruction of the city.\n\nThe Belgrade-based media sometimes reported about the alleged conspiracy of ‘foreign forces’ to destroy Yugoslavia. In one instance, TV Belgrade showed Tuđman shaking hands with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, accusing them of plotting to impose 'a Fourth Reich', whereas even the Vatican was blamed for 'supporting secessionists'. As a consequence, in September 1991, the German and Vatican Embassy were even targets of Serbian protesters, who shouted that ‘Pope John Paul II supports neo-facism in Croatia’.\n\nDuring the notorious false flag Operation Opera Orientalis conducted in 1991 by the Yugoslav Air Force intelligence service, the Serbian media repeatedly made false accusations in which Croatia was connected with World War II, Fascism, Nazism and anti-Semitism with the aim to discredit the Croatian demands for independence in the West.\n\nThe Serbian media emphasized that Croatian president Franjo Tuđman started the war in Croatia. In order to corroborate that notion, the media repeatedly referenced his speech in Zagreb, on 24 May 1992, claiming that he allegedly said: \"There would not have been a war had Croatia not wanted one\". During their trials at the ICTY, Slobodan Milošević and Milan Martić also frequently resorted to Tuđman's quote in order to prove their innocence.\n\nHowever, the ICTY prosecutors obtained the integral tape of his speech and played it in its entirety during Martić's trial on 23 October 2006, proving that Tuđman never said that Croatia \"wanted the war\". Upon playing that tape, Borislav Đukić had to admit that Tuđman did not say that. The quote is actually the following: \"\"Some individuals in the world who were not friends of Croatia claimed that we too were responsible for the war. And I replied to them: Yes, there would not have been a war had we given up our goal to create a sovereign and independent Croatia. We suggested that our goal should be achieved without war, and that the Yugoslav crisis should be resolved by transforming the federation, in which nobody was satisfied, particularly not the Croatian nation, into a union of sovereign countries in which Croatia would be sovereign, with its own army, own money, own diplomacy. They did not accept\".\"\n\nSerbian propaganda during the Bosnian War portrayed the Bosnian Muslims as violent extremists and Islamic-fundamentalists. After a series of massacres of Bosniaks, a few hundred (between 300 and 1,500) Arabic-speaking mercenaries primarily from the Middle East and North Africa, called Mujahideen, came into Bosnia in the second half of 1992 with the aim of helping \"their Muslim brothers\". The Serb media, however, reported a much bigger number of Mujahideen and presented them as terrorists and a huge threat to European security in order to inflame anti-Muslim hatred among Serbs and other Christians. Although Serbian media created much controversy about alleged war crimes committed by them, no indictment was issued by ICTY against any of these foreign volunteers.\n\nJust before the Prijedor massacre of Bosniak and Croat civilians, Serb propaganda characterized prominent non-Serbs as criminals and extremists who should be punished for their behaviour. Dr. Mirsad Mujadžić, a Bosniak politician, was accused of injecting drugs into Serb women in order to make them incapable of conceiving male children, which in turn contributed to a reduction in the birth rate among Serbs, and Dr. Željko Sikora, a Croat, referred to as the \"Monster Doctor\", was accused of forcing abortions onto Serbian women if they were pregnant with male children and of castrating the male babies of Serbian parents. Moreover, in a \"Kozarski Vjesnik\" article dated 10 June 1992, Dr. Osman Mahmuljin was accused of deliberately having provided incorrect medical care to his Serb colleague Dr. Živko Dukić, who had a heart attack.\n\nMile Mutić, the director of Kozarski Vjesnik and journalist Rade Mutić regularly attended meetings of Serb politicians in order to get informed about the next steps of spreading propaganda.\n\nThe Markale massacres were two artillery attacks on civilians at the Markale marketplace, committed by the Army of Republika Srpska during the Siege of Sarajevo. Encouraged by the initial UNPROFOR report, Serbian media claimed that the Bosnian government had shelled its own civilians in order to drag the Western powers to intervene against the Serbs. However, in January 2003, the War Crime Tribunal concluded that the massacre was committed by Serb forces around Sarajevo. Although widely reported by the international media, the verdict was ignored in Serbia itself.\n\nDuring the Siege of Sarajevo, Serb propaganda was trying to justify the siege at any cost, and as the result of that effort the Serbian national television showed a report about \"Serb children being given as food for lions in Sarajevo Zoo called Pionirska Dolina by Muslim extremists\".\n\nWhile the Srebrenica enclave was under siege by the Army of the Republika Srpska, its commander Naser Orić led several attacks around the nearby Serb held villages, many of which were Muslim villages prior to conflict overtaken by Serbian forces during the first months of the siege. Orić was later even indicted by the ICTY. In his judgment, it was established that the regular Bosnian troops in Srebrenica were often unable to restrain the large groups of starving civilians who took part in the attacks to get food from Serbian villages. Nonetheless, these attacks were described by some Serb media as the main trigger for the Serb attack on Srebrenica in 1995. A TV presenter in Pale told 'Srebrenica was liberated from terrorists' and that 'the offensive took place after the Muslim side attacked the Serb villages outside the Srebrenica protected zone'.\n\nTwo members of the Federal Security Service (KOG) testified for the Prosecution in Milosevic's trial about their involvement in Milošević's propaganda campaign. Slobodan Lazarević revealed alleged KOG clandestine activities designed to undermine the peace process, including mining a soccer field, a water tower and the reopened railway between Zagreb and Belgrade. These actions were blamed on Croats. Mustafa Candić, one of four assistant chiefs of KOG, described the use of technology to fabricate conversations, making it sound as if Croat authorities were telling Croats in Serbia to leave for an ethnically pure Croatia. The conversation was broadcast following a Serb attack on Croatians living in Serbia, forcing them to flee. He testified to another instance of disinformation involving a television broadcast of corpses, described as Serb civilians killed by Croats. Candić testified that he believed they were in fact the bodies of Croats killed by Serbs, though this statement has not been verified. He also corroborated the existence of Operations Opera and Labrador.\n\nDuring the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the building of the Radio Television of Serbia in Belgrade was destroyed by NATO, although not without controversy; France opposed the bombing and Amnesty International as well as Human Rights Watch condemned it as an attack on a civilian target.\n\nWhen Milošević's government was overthrown in October 2000, RTS was a primary target of demonstrators. After attacking the Parliament, the demonstrators headed for the RTS building.\n\nOn 23 May 2011, Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) issued an official apology for the way their programming was misused for spreading propaganda and discrediting political opponents in the 1990s, and for the fact that their programming had \"hurt the feelings, moral integrity and dignity of the citizens of Serbia, humanist-oriented intellectuals, members of the political opposition, critically minded journalists, certain minorities in Serbia, minority religious groups in Serbia, as well as certain neighbouring peoples and states.\"\n\nThe Croats also used propaganda against Serbs and against Bosniaks during the 1992-1994 Croat-Bosniak War, which was part of the larger Bosnian War. In its 1993 report, the OHCHR warned that a major Croatian TV media was under the government control and that the state of the media was a one of \"prevailing climate of national and religious hatred which is often encouraged through misinformation, censorship and indoctrination\". During the Croat-Bosniak conflict, the Croatian media called Bosnian Muslims \"aggressors\". A report by \"Vjesnik\" alleging that 35 Croats were hanged near the Catholic church in Zenica on 9 August 1993 was later proven to be false.\n\nDuring the Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing, Croat forces seized the television broadcasting stations (for example at Skradno) and created their own local radio and television to broadcast propaganda. In the same incident, they seized the public institutions, raised the Croatian flag over public institution buildings, and imposed the Croatian Dinar as the unit of currency. During this time, Busovača's Bosniaks were forced to sign an act of allegiance to the Croat authorities and fell victim to numerous attacks on shops and businesses and, gradually, left the area out of fear that they would be the victims of mass crimes. According to ICTY Trial Chambers in the \"Blaškić case\", Croat authorities created a radio station in Kiseljak to broadcast nationalist propaganda. A similar pattern was applied in Mostar and Gornji Vakuf (where the Croats created a radio station called \"Radio Uskoplje\").\n\nLocal propaganda efforts in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by the Croats, were supported by Croatian daily newspapers such as Večernji List and Croatian Radio-Television, especially by controversial reporters Dijana Čuljak and Smiljko Šagolj who are still blamed by the families of Bosniak victims in the \"Vranica Case\" for inciting the massacre of Bosnian POWs in Mostar, when broadcasting a report about alleged terrorists arrested by Croats who victimized Croat civilians. The bodies of the Bosnian POWs were later found in a Goranci mass grave. Croatian Radio-Television presented the Croat attack on Mostar, as a Bosnian Muslim attack on Croats who were aligned with the Serbs. According to the ICTY, in the early hours of 9 May 1993, the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) attacked Mostar using artillery, mortars, heavy weapons and small arms. The HVO controlled all roads leading into Mostar and international organisations were denied access. Radio Mostar announced that all Bosniaks should hang out a white flag from their windows. The HVO attack was well prepared and planned.\n\nDuring the ICTY trials against Croat war leaders, many Croatian journalists participated as the defence witnesses trying to relativise war crimes committed by Croatian troops against non-Croat civilians (Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbs in Croatia). During the trial against General Tihomir Blaškić (later convicted of war crimes), Ivica Mlivončić, Croatian columnist in Slobodna Dalmacija, tried to defend the General by presenting a number of claims in his book \"Zločin s Pečatom\" about the alleged \"genocide against Croats\" (most of it unproven or false), which was considered by the Trial Chambers as irrelevant for the case. After the conviction, he continued to write in \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" against the ICTY presenting it \"as the court against Croats\", with chauvinistic claims that the ICTY cannot be unbiassed because \"it is financed by Saudi Arabia (i.e. Muslims)\".\n\nIn \"Intelligence and the war in Bosnia, 1992-1995\", Cees Wiebes writes that US intelligence had \"exposed many media reports from Sarajevo as little more than Bosnian propaganda.\"\n\nIn his 1995 book \"Selling the Bosnian Myth to America: Buyer Beware\", John E. Sray claimed that the media played up the \"Good Guy, Bad Guy\" dichotomy between the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims, and ignored or played-down massacres committed by Muslims against Serbs: \"Much of the media has become so engrossed in platitudes and their own self-fulfilling prophecies that Bosnian propaganda is now widely accepted as an article of faith, and journalists have abrogated their responsibility to verify their information.\"\n\nIn the Bosnian newspaper, Dani, an article shortly after the war began contributed every war in the region since the Treaty of Ghent to \"the Serbs\". Later in the war, the newspaper called on every Bosnian Muslim to name one Serb and then to kill that person.\n\nMost of Bosniak politicians were inflating the numbers of Bosniaks killed in order to gain the sympathies of the west. Haris Silajdžić, Bosnian Foreign Minister, claimed that there were 128,444 Bosniaks killed by December 1992.\nHowever, after the war the total number of deaths in the three-and-a-half of years of the war from all sides is estimated to be around 100,000.\n\nSilajdžić also claimed that from April to December 1992 60,000 instances of rape against Bosniak women committed by Serbs. Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe estimates the total number to be around 20,000 from all three sides during the whole war.\n\n\n"}

It was presented to Congress on December 5, 1791.\n\nIt laid forth economic principles rooted in both the Mercantilist system of Elizabeth I's England and the practices of Jean-Baptiste Colbert of France. The principal ideas of the Report would later be incorporated into the \"American System\" program by Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky and his Whig Party. Abraham Lincoln, who called himself a \"Henry Clay tariff Whig\" during his early years, would later make the principles cornerstones, together with opposition to the institution and expansion of slavery, of the fledgling Republican Party.\n\nHamilton's ideas formed the basis for the \"American School\" of economics.\n\nHamilton reasoned that to secure American independence, the United States needed to have a sound policy of encouraging the growth of manufacturing and ensure its future as a permanent feature of the economic system of the nation. He argued these could be achieved through bounties or subsidies to industry, regulation of trade with moderate tariffs (not intended to discourage imports but to raise revenue to support American manufacturing through subsidy), and other government encouragement. These policies would not only promote the growth of manufacturing but provide diversified employment opportunities and promoted immigration into the young United States. They would also expand the applications of technology and science for all quarters of the economy, including agriculture.\n\nHamilton reasoned that tariffs issued in moderation would raise revenue to fund the nation. The tariff could also be used to encourage domestic (or national) manufacturing and growth of the economy by applying the funds raised in part towards subsidies (called bounties in his time) to manufacturers. Hamilton sought to use the tariff to:\n\n\nHamilton reasoned that bounties (subsidies) to industry, which would rely on funds raised by moderate tariffs, would be the best means of growing manufacturing without decreasing supply or increasing prices of goods. Such encouragement through direct support would make American enterprise competitive and independent along with the nation as a whole. In part subsidies would be used to:\n\n\nThough Congress refused to accept Hamilton's proposals in 1791, due to opposition from James Madison and his supporters, much of Hamilton's third report would later be adopted by the United States Congress despite continued opposition to the support of industry through subsidy. Both sides agreed that manufacturing independence was desirable and necessary but disagreed on how to obtain it. The Jeffersonian Democratic-Republican Party's main objection to subsidy was their fear that subsidy would lead to corruption and favoritism of certain sections of the new nation over others; namely the north over the agrarian south. This divide (north vs. south) would come up again and again in issues of economic policy until the outbreak of the American Civil War.\n\nIt is often thought that Hamilton's report was completely ignored, but in fact \"Hamilton worked to ensure that Congress enacted virtually every tariff recommendation in the report within five months of its delivery.\" Hamilton's revenue-based trade policy, with its more moderate tariffs, meant that, by 1794, manufacturers had switched their support from the Federalists to the Republicans.\n\nLeading opponents of Alexander Hamilton's economic plan included Thomas Jefferson (until later years) and James Madison, who were opposed to the use of subsidy to industry along with most of their fledgling Democratic-Republican Party. Instead of bounties they reasoned in favor of high tariffs and restrictions on imports to increase manufacturing; which was favored by the manufacturers themselves who desired protection of their home market. Although the Jeffersonian stance originally favored an \"agrarian\" economy of farmers, this changed over time to encompass many of Hamilton's original ideas, while \"the Madison administration helped give rise to the first truly protectionist tariff in U.S. history.\"\n\n\n"}

It is a form of moderate realism.\n\nThe \"problem of universals\", which was an ancient problem in metaphysics about whether universals exist. For John Duns Scotus, a Franciscan philosopher, theologian and Catholic priest, universals such as \"greenness\" and \"goodness\" exist in reality. This is opposed to the later conceptualism of William of Ockham, and the earlier views of Abelard and others, which say universals exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial reality.\n\nThe problem of universals existed as early as Plato, who taught the Theory of Forms, that universal \"forms\" existed. This opinion was rejected by many later thinkers, such as Peter Abelard, who instead argued that forms are merely mental constructs.\nScotus denied these claims; in his \"Opus Oxoniense\" he argued that universals have a real and substantial existence. For Scotus, the problem of universals was closely tied to that of individuation, by identifying what makes a particular thing this or that particular thing; we could also come to understand if any form of universal exists, it is in this work that Scotus introduces the word \"haecceity\", which means the \"thisness\" of a particular object – what makes it what it is.\n\nIn this, Scotus argues that form is a better means of individuating a particular object; because according to him the form of an object as a composite is the best manner of making objects distinct from one another, rather than the matter of the object. This is at the heart of Scotist realism, particularly at the theories of haecceity and formal distinction. Scotus also argues, against Aquinas and others, that there is no distinction between the essence of a thing and its existence.\n\nThe American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce was quite influenced by Scotus. Here is a statement of Peirce's interpretation of Scotistic Realism by T. A. Goudge:\n\nThe gist of that 'subtle and difficult' doctrine is taken by Peirce to be as follows. Apart from thought, only singular things exist. But there are in singulars certain 'natures,' themselves neither universal nor particular, which constitute the ground of intelligibility. In things, these natures are particular; when brought into relation with an act of the intellect, they are universal ... Thus, for example, the directly experienced hard surface of a particular stone is determinate, whereas the universal hardness which the intellect grasps is indeterminate or general. A consequence of this view is that the individual per se is not a proper object of knowledge. What we know are genera and species, themselves the product of mental action. Yet because complete being embraces both universality and particularity, because man perceives the singular with his senses while cognizing the universal with his intellect, it is possible for him to attain to the singular by relating universals to something which is \"this.\"\n\nPeirce interprets Scotus's idea of individuation or haecceity (thisness) in terms of his own category of \"secondness.\" When we think of \"this,\" we are relating our pointing finger, for example, or a particular sense organ with another individual thing. As Scotus said, \"nothing is \"this\" in itself.\" It is so only in relation to something else. Goudge goes on to give Peirce's argument for the objectivity of universals: \n\nThe objection may be raised that such a view destroys the reality of the universal by making it depend on a relation to thought. Peirce replies that this objection springs from the belief that the real must be wholly independent of reflective activity, i.e., must be a thing in itself. But the notion of the thing in itself is self-contradictory, for it requires us to think about what is per definitionem out of relation to thought. We can have no conception of any incognizable reality ... Indeed, “a realist is simply one who knows no more recondite reality than that which is represented in a true representation.”\n"}

He established the Center for Microhistorical Research (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/) at the Reykjavík Academy (http://www.akademia.is/index.php/en) in 2003. He currently holds a research position at the National Museum of Iceland (http://www.natmus.is/english) named after Dr. Kristján Eldjárn, the former president of Iceland and an archaeologist. The following text is based on his book The History War: Essays and Narrative on Ideology (Reykjavik, The Center for Microhistorical Research, 2007) (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/sogustrid.html), which is autobiographical in nature and deals with historiographical issues such as the development of ideas which are part of the microhistorical agenda. Magnússon is the author of 16 books (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/publications.html) and has been involved in the publication of nine more through a book series which he has co-edited. His latest book, titled Wasteland with Words.

He completed his B.A. in history and philosophy in 1984 from University of Iceland (http://www.hi.is/en/introduction). His thesis was published year later in a book called, The Mode of Living in Iceland, 1930–1940, by the Institute of History at the University of Iceland (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/lifshaettir.html). That same year he started his doctoral studies in Pittsburgh, USA, at Carnegie Mellon University in history where he received a M.A. degree in 1988 and a doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in 1993. His dissertation dealt with popular culture and is titled The Continuity of Everyday Life: Popular Culture in Iceland 1850–1940 (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/dissertation.html).\n\nMagnússon has taught part-time at the University of Iceland (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/namskeid.html) and in other academic settings in Iceland from 1994 when he returned from the USA. He taught at his former university, Carnegie Mellon, in the spring of 2002 when he was a Fulbright Scholar for six months. In 1998 he became in the first chair of an independent research institute called The Reykjavik Academy (http://www.akademia.is/), which was founded by independent scholars who received their education in Iceland, Scandinavia, Europe and USA. The colorful saga of the Reykjavík Academy attracted considerable outside attention, from its humble beginnings as a forum for ten independent scholars to its eventually housing 80 researchers from all areas of the humanities and social sciences.\n\nIn 2003, Magnússon founded and chaired the Center for Microhistorical Research (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/), which, among other things, runs the international web-page microhistory.org (http://www.microhistory.org/) and publishes books on microhistorical issues. He is the editor of the web-journal The Journal of Microhistory (http://www.microhistory.org/journal2006.php) with his co-worker and a long-time friend Dr. Davið Ólafsson (http://www.akademia.is/index.php/en/the-society/society-members/47-d/113-davie-olafsson-). Magnússon is the founder and one of three editors of the book series Anthology of Icelandic Popular Culture (http://www.akademia.is/index.php/is/utgafa/synisbaekur-islenskrar-altyeu) which has already published 14 books in cooperation with the University of Iceland Press (http://www.haskolautgafan.hi.is/page/hu_utgafan). The other editors are Dr. Már Jónsson (http://notendur.hi.is/marj/), professor at the University of Iceland, and Dr. Davíð Ólafsson, a researcher and independent scholar at the Reykjavik Academy.\n\nIt could be argued that the primary objective of many of Magnússon's work has been to present a view of the ways in which history, and in particular social history, has developed in the last 15–20 years, at a time of major reassessment within the academic world manifested in the radical ideas grouped under the banner of postmodernism and/or poststructuralism. The History War is based on his former research, which he has published in recent years on first hand sources, microhistory and everyday life. That includes the following books: Dreams of Things Past: Life Writing in Iceland (2004) (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/dreams.html); Metastories: Memory, Recollection, and History (2005) (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/metastories.html); Academic Liturgy. Humanities and the Society of Scholars (2007) (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/liturgy.html), and finally a book, which he co-edited, called From Re-evaluation to Disintegration. Two Final Theses, One Introduction, Three Interviews, Seven Articles, Five Photographs, One Afterword and A Few Obituaries from the Field of Humanities (2006) (http://www.akademia.is/sigm/disintegration.html).\n\nAfter mostly dealing with the methods of microhistory for over ten years Magnússon turned back to his empirical research in 2007 with the focus on material culture and everyday life. Just recently, his book Wasteland with Words. A Social History of Iceland (2010) (http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/book.html?id=412), was published by Reaktion books (http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/) in England (see criticism in The Economist: http://www.economist.com/culture/displaystory.cfm?story_id=16213940&fsrc=rss). The book is written as an attempt to explain how the culture of Iceland was formed through a long process of literary practice from the beginning of the settlement in the ninth century up to modern times. It is also an analysis of an island culture, which successfully stepped into the twentieth century without losing its cultural identity. That success story ends with the meltdown of the banking, economic, and the political system in 2008. The focus of the book is on the people of Iceland, how they managed to survive in a relatively hostile environment thorough the centuries and become, for a while, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The resent sequence of events in 2008 are explained in the light of the historical development in Iceland. This is an experiment in social- and/or microhistorical studies, in which he strives to deal with a long period of time using the methods of microhistory.\n\n"}

He was mostly known in UK by the name Thomas Henri Zavalani.\n\nZavalani was born on 15 August 1903 in Monastir, Ottoman Empire, today's Bitola in the Republic of Macedonia, or Korça, today's Albania. He was the son of Albanian activist and nationalist Fehim Zavalani and Qerime Frashëri from Korçë. His father had settled in Monastir, very active within the Albanian patriotic circles of Monastir Vilayet, close cooperator of the Kyrias family, and participant in the Congress of Monastir (1908) and Congress of Dibra (1909). The Congress of Monastir was held in a hotel owned by him.\n<br>Tajar Zavalani took his first studies in the Marist Brothers French Catholic School, and after the bombardment of Monastir during World War I he left for Salonica, where he enlisted in the French lyceum. He studied studied literature there.\n<br>Zavalani came in Tirana in 1922. He started working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, initially as a secretary of the Commission for the Border Delimitation headed by Ali Pasha Kolonja. The commission was part of task-force commissions throughout post-World War I Europe for delimiting disputable border segments, as decided by Paris Peace Conference of 1919.\n<br>In June 1924, he took part in the uprising of Vlora as a member of the \"Bashkimi\" (Unity) Organization of the recently assassinated Avni Rustemi. These events led to Fan Noli and his supporters coming to power. After the return of Ahmet Zogu in power by December 1924, Zavalani fled to Italy. The Soviet Union offered to let him study in Russia as a \"victim of counterrevolution\". After a year in Moscow, despite his hobby of electrotechnics, he attended the Marxist–Leninist school in Leningrad. In the summer of 1929, he returned to Moscow and worked at the Agrarian Institute, specialising in economics. In November 1930, he managed to get out of Soviet Union with his perception of the Soviet Union being altered by the collectivisation campaign. He settled in Berlin, and soon-after in Leysin, near Montreux in Switzerland. There he was treated for tuberculosis.\n<br>In January 1933, Zavalani returned to Albania, where he was active in the translation of literary works, mostly from Russian and French literature, and as a publicist. Among other translations was \"The mother\", a novel of Gorky which was banned by the authorities. In 1935 he was Director of State Lyceum in Tirana, later director of \"Malet T'ona\" College, and chaired Tirana branch of the Vllaznija Literary Society. Meanwhile, his brother Hysen, who had also settled in the Soviet Union, would be executed by the Soviets due to involvement in some turmoils in Saratov (1938). From a bearer of the Communist ideas, he abandoned the Communist movement, and actually became an anti-communist.\n<br>In 1936, he married Selma Vrioni (1915–1995), also known as Maria Selma, daughter of Kahreman Vrioni (1889–1955), a rich bey from Fier area, and Emine Frashëri (daughter of Abdyl Frashëri).\n<br>After the Italian invasion of 1939, he was interned in northern Italy, from where he escaped with his wife, who was a former lady-in-waiting to former Queen Geraldine, reaching former King Zog's party and settling to England in 1940. In November 1940, he was given a job in the BBC's Albanian-language\nservice. With his friend Costa Chekrezi, and his BBC colleagues Dervish Duma and Anton Logoreci, he appealed to the British authorities and to King Zog for monetary support for establishing a \"Free Albanian\" committee which would serve like a government in exile. Although the idea was supported by the British albanophiles, it did not make it to light due to Zogu's rejection. Ahmet Zogu replied that \"his position as the Head of State of Albania and could not be affected by the attitude of few lads in London\".\n<br>Zavalani worked for BBC for the rest of his life. He was a member of PEN Club and published in its press organ \"Arena\", and Chairman of ACEN branch of London. Zavalani died in an accident in 1966. His wife engaged as a representative of the \"Free Albania\" National Committee after his death.\n\nZavalani published:\nZavalani supported the theory of a non-forced islamisation of Albanians during the Ottoman times.\n\n"}

The editions of \"The Instructor\" published in 1824 and 1838 have a portrait of Molineux, engraved by Robert Cabbell Roffe from a painting by Scott.\n\nMolineux was also the author of a short treatise on arithmetic. His letters to Roffe were edited and printed privately in a limited edition, as \"The Grand Master\" (London, 1860). Roffe was an engraver in London, whom Molineux taught shorthand by correspondence, and who became the author of another modification of the Byrom system. It contains notes on shorthand authors.\n\nMolineux was married and had a daughter, who married John Jackson, vicar of Over, Cheshire.\n\n"}

Aztec civilization saw the rise of a military culture that was closed off to women and made their role complementary to men. The status of Aztec women lasted until the 15th century, when Spanish conquest forced European norms onto the culture. However, many pre-Columbian norms survived and their legacy still remains.\n\nThe status of Aztec women changed throughout the history of the civilization. As emphasis on warfare increased, notions of egalitarianism became less important.\n\nAztec marriage practices were similar to those of other Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Mayans. Aztecs married at a later age, during their late teens and early twenties, whereas in Mayan culture it was not unusual for marriages to be arranged by parents for a son and daughter who were still children. Aztec marriages were initiated by the parents of the potential groom. After consulting with the extended kinship group, the parents would approach a professional matchmaker (\"ah atanzah\"), who would approach the potential bride's family. The parents of the young woman would advise the matchmaker whether or not they accepted the proposal. Brides were expected to be virgins before marriage, although young people of both sex were advised to be celibate.\n\nThe marriage celebration was a four-day event, and the wedding ceremony took place on the first day. The bride would wear fine robes. Her kinswomen would decorate her arms and legs with red feathers, and paint her face with a paste containing small shimmering crystals. The ceremony would take place at the house of the groom's parents. A fire would be lit in the hearth, and incense would be burned as an offering to the gods. The groom's parents would give presents (robes and mantles) to the bride's parents. The ritual for finalizing the marriage involved the matchmaker tying the groom's cape to the bride's skirt, and then the groom's mother would give the bride and groom each four mouthfuls of tamales. Four days of feasting followed the ceremony.\n\nFor the purpose of political, military or economic alliances marriages among Aztec nobles were arranged. For example, when Cosijoeza married Ahuitzotl's daughter to seal the alliance between the Aztecs and the Zapotecs in 1496. Aztec kings reportedly had dozens of wives and many children. However, polygamy was only a practice among the nobles of Aztec civilization; the majority of the population were monogamous.\n\nOne of the few positions of power women could hold in Aztec society was that of the tlamatlquiticitl, or the midwife. These women were proficient in dealing with difficulties arising during pregnancy and labour but as most of the information we have about their practices is passed on from upper class Aztec men and the Spanish conquerors, much of the traditional knowledge has been lost. A tlamatlquiticitl attended every pregnant woman, no matter status or class, although women of higher status often had a more than one attend them. The tlamatlquiticitl was essential to assisting in birth, and additionally to providing prenatal care advice.\n\nThe Florentine Codex outlines much of the advice the tlamatlquiticitl gave to excepting mothers. The mother was advised to engage in sex with her husband during the first few months of the pregnancy so as to help the child develop, but around the seventh or eighth month she was to abstain. If she did not it was believed that the semen may act like glue and the baby would not come out, or if it did it would be feeble with misshaped fingers and toes and covered in what looks like atole so that everyone would see how the couple could not abstain, and they would be shamed. The expecting mother was also told she must avoid prolonged periods in the sweat bath, for too much heat was thought to roast the child and it would be stuck inside the womb; however, too much heat specifically around the abdomen area would cause the child to swell and suffer from the heat. Chewing chicle was not allowed otherwise the baby would be born with perforated lips and would not be able to suckle or eat. Likewise if she ate earth or chalk the child would be in poor health. The tlamatlquiticitl knew that the baby took nourishment from the mother and so what she ate it would absorb; if she fasted the child would starve. Because of this the mother was to eat and drink well, even after the birth. The mother was also warned not to look at anything red otherwise the child would extend crosswise, making for a complicated delivery. She was not allowed to observe lunar eclipses, otherwise the child would be born with a clef palate. Eclipses were also associated with miscarriages. And she was also not to look at anything that would frighten or anger her lest she should harm the child. Walking around late at night was avoided otherwise the child would cry incessantly. If the mother took naps during the day the tlamatlquiticitl warned that the child would be born with unusually large eyelids. Lifting heavy objects was also associated with damaging the fetus. The tlamatlquiticitl also told others that the expectant mother should not be in want of anything, all her desires should be fulfilled quickly otherwise the child would suffer. Not only did the tlamatlquiticitl provide this advice but she also attended and took over household duties for the expectant mother towards the end of the pregnancy. This support, in combination with the advice on stress management, such as avoiding stressful relationships, and the suggestion to not lift heavy objects or overwork themselves, helped to contribute to the healthy psychological development of their children.\n\nThe woman would know when it was almost time for her delivery as she would feel discomfort in her womb a few days prior. Because the tlamatlquiticitl resided in the house, the mother was well prepared for the birth. If the child presented in breech position the tlamatlquiticitl, who was skilled in massage, would take the mother into a sweat bath and massage the womb to turn the baby around. The typical position for labour was squatting, as gravity would assist as the child was being pushed out. To induce labour the tlamatlquiticitl would at first give the mother Montanoa tomentosa, and failing that, they would then administer a drink made from  possum tail, that was shown to prompt contractions. In modern clinical trials, many of these mixtures have been proven to have induced contractions. However the Spanish Friars believed these concoctions to be witchcraft, and since both ritualistic and natural elements were used by the tlamatlquiticitl, the Spanish decided the tlamatlquiticitl was evil and the colonizers eradicated these practices. TThe act of birthing was considered a battle and the tlamatlquiticitl would give the mother a miniature shield and spear for the fight. When the baby was born, the midwife would make a series of battle cries, praising the mother who had fought through her labour to deliver the baby. The tlamatlquiticitl would cut the umbilical cord which connects the child to its mother and the gods, and it would be dried. After the placenta came out it was taken and buried in a corner of the house by the tlamatlquiticitl. Then the preserved umbilical cords were buried, and according to the Spanish accounts, they would be buried near a battlefield if the child was a boy or beneath the hearth if it was a girl, to indicate their futures. According to the birthing almanacs such as the Codex Yoalli Ehēcatlthe umbilical cord was planted to ensure the relationship between the gods and child.\n\nIf the child died in childbirth, the tlamatlquiticitl would employ an obsidian knife to remove the fetus in pieces so as not to harm the mother. The tlamatlquiticitl warned the mother not to be trouble by the loss of her child otherwise the spirit of the child would suffer. Scholars argue, with evidence based in bioarcheology, that this same method was also used to perform abortions, although they were generally frowned upon. The life of the mother was the priority over saving the fetus if the situation was life-threatening, and if the mother was at risk, then the fetus would be dismembered so she would survive. Women who died during childbirth were given the same honour as a soldier who was slain in battle, and were portrayed as spirits known as cihuateteo.\n\nAfter delivery the tlamatlquiticitl would remain in the house so as to help the mother and monitor her milk supply. Since the child would not begin weaning until after 24 months, this was an important process. These four days of monitoring also were to ensure a speedy recovery of the mother, and so the tlamatlquiticitl would prepare baths and meals for her. After this period, the bathing ceremony would take place.\n\nThe Codex Mendoza depicts the bathing ceremony, which was conducted by the tlamatlquiticitl, four days after the birth. The child was washed in an earthenware tub on a rush mat and on each side were symbols, one for boys and the other for girls. For girls the three objects had to do with homemaking: a basket, a broom, and a spindle. And there were five objects for boys, which had to do with male professions: an obsidian blade representing a featherworker, a brush for a scribe, an awl that carpenters work with, a tool used by goldsmiths, and shields with a bow and arrow for a warrior. The tlamatlquiticitl circled around the mat counter-clockwise with the child, washed the child, and then shouted out the name she has chosen for the child as she presented it to the gods. The water she used to cleanse the outside and inside of the body does not serve the same symbolic function that it does in a Christian baptism, but rather it is used to arouse the spirit of the child and let the gods in. The Codex Yoallo Ehēcatl depicts this bathing ceremony as performed by the gods, and but it is understood that the tlamatlquiticitl impersonated the gods while performing these rituals because they so closely resemble what is depicted. For example, the Yoallo Ehēcatl shows images of the gods presenting the children as well as cutting the umbilical cord. After the ceremony the tlamatlquiticitl would swaddle the child and give a speech to the mother on how valiantly she had fought and how it was time for rest. Kinsmen were then invited to see the child and praise the mother, which concluded a successful birth.\n\nWomen mainly worked inside the home, spinning and weaving thread from cotton, henepen, or maquey agave. They used a handheld drop spindle, then wove cloth using a loom that they strapped to their backs and held in their laps. They were responsible for tending turkeys and dogs that were raised for meat. Extra cloth, vegetables or other items were taken by women to the nearest market to be sold or bartered for a needed item.\n\nOne of the most important roles of Aztec women in the home was to prepare maize flour for making tortillas, an important tradition for Mexican families today. Dried maize was soaked in lime water, a process known as nixtamalization, and the nixtamalized grains ground. As part of Aztec etiquette, men ate before women.\n\nWomen had a number of other professions in Aztec civilization, including priest, doctor, sorcerer. Women were often recognized in their civilization as professional weavers and crafters.\n\nImages in Aztec codices, ceramics and sculptures display the elaborate and colorful designs of Aztec weavers. There were regional textile specialties, with associated graphic designs. Most designs were geometric, with some regions specializing in textiles with animal and plant images. Cotton was generally used, and dyes came from blue clays, yellow ochres, and red came from insects living in nopal cacti. Purple was derived from the sea snail \"Purpura patula\", similar to how the Phoenicians also derived purple dye used for royal robes from snails.\n\nHowever, Aztec women were not allowed a role in the military. They could not be admitted into the military training school. This meant that women were denied access to one of the largest sources of wealth and prestige within Aztec society.\n\nFertility was considered to be part of the realm of the Aztec earth goddesses, particularly the mother goddess Tonantzin. Another earth goddess was Cihuacoatl, as well as a supporter of women who died during childbirth. Rain and earth goddesses were considered responsible for droughts when they were not properly appeased.\n\nThe Spanish\nconquest of Aztec territories decreased much of the indigenous population, through warfare and by bringing new diseases, such as smallpox, for which the Aztecs had no immunities. The population that did survive these threats was confronted by other profound attacks upon their culture in the form of Spanish institutions such as the Roman Catholic religion.\n\nAs early as 1529, the Spanish began coercively converting Aztecs to Catholicism. They focused on the Aztec nobility initially, to create an example for the other Aztecs to follow. Nobles such as Quetzalmacatzin, King of Amaquemecan (Chalco), were forced to choose one wife and abandon the others, to comply with the current Christian institution of marriage, which meant monogamy. Aztec polygamous arrangements, with secondary wives and children, were not legally recognized by the Spanish, who considered such women and children illegitimate and disinherited from claims to ranks or property. This also tore apart the political and economic fabric of Aztec culture, since noble marriages were made with political and territorial claims in mind.\n\nWorking demands became harsh for women after the Spanish arrived and the encomiendas were created. Aztec communities had already lost many men to war and epidemics, and the encomiendas meant that more men worked outside of their villages for the encomenderos. Traditional gender-based divisions of labour became irrelevant. Women no longer had men to do plowing, and were left to do all the agricultural tasks themselves, which included the planting and harvesting, as well as growing enough produce to meet the tribute demands of the encomiendas. . Over several generations, many young women left the rural areas to work as domestic servants or as market vendors in the cities. By the 17th century, Andean women were the majority of the market vendors in colonial cities such as La Paz (Bolivia), Cuzco (Peru), and Quito (Ecuador).\n\nThe new Spanish culture prohibited women working outside of their home as their priority was to raise children. Their independence as workers with paid occupations was ended by the Spanish, particularly in textile work. When the Spanish eventually set up industrial textile mills, they had only men working in the mills.\n"}
