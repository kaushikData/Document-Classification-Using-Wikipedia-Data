In 1352 he was a student at Bologna and later filled the office of Lector there as well as at Padua, Pisa, Sienna, and Florence. He also preached for many years with great succession different Italian cities. He died about 1401, renowned no less for sanctity than for learning, and is commemorated in the Franciscan Martyrology on 4 November.\n\nBartholomew's chief title to fame rests upon his remarkable book, \"De Conformitate Vitae B. P. Francisco ad Vitam Domini Nostri Jesu Christi\", begun in 1385 and formally approved by the general chapter held at Assisi in 1399. Enthusiastically received on its appearance and long held in high esteem, this work became the object of bitter attacks on the part of Lutherans and Jansenists. Against it Erasmus Alber wrote the \"Alcoranus Franciscanus\" (Der Barfusser Monche Eulenspiegel und Alcoran mit einer Vorrede D. M. Luthers, 1531) in reply to which Henry Sedulius, OFM, published his \"Apologeticus adversus Alcoranum Franciscanorum pro libro Conformitatum\" (Antwerp, 1607).\n\nSubsequent writers on Franciscan history ignored the work; more recently it has been over-praised. Between these extreme views, the \"Conformities\" is a book of very uneven value. The parallels between the lives of Our Lord and St. Francis which form its basis are sometimes forced, but nowhere does it make St. Francis the equal of Christ. Side by side with fantastic legends, ridiculous visions, and other absurdities, it contains historical information. It is considered a source of great importance for Franciscan history. It was first printed at Milan in 1510 and in 1513. The new edition published at Bologna in 1590 is mutilated and corrupted, especially in the historical parts, at almost every page. A critical edition of the text was published in tom. IV of the \"Analecta Franciscana\" (Quaracchi, 1906).\n\nIn addition to the \"Conformities\", Bartholomew left some thirty other works, including an exposition of the Rule of the Friars Minor found in the \"Speculum\" Morin (Rouen, 1509) and a book \"De Vita B. Mariae Virginis\", published at Venice in 1596; his Lenten sermons were printed at Milan in 1498, Venice, 1503, and Lyons, 1519. Sbaralea and others have attributed to him the \"Summa Casuum Conscientiae\", which is really the work of Bartholomew a S. Concordio of Pisa, O. P., and the \"Vita B.

Traditionally, the mens rea for murder was malice aforethought. While murder and voluntary manslaughter are both intentional homicides, adequate provocation mitigates a defendant's culpability. Adequate provocation is a legal requirement for a murder charge to be reduced to voluntary manslaughter. The test for adequate provocation varies across jurisdictions and has changed over time. The categorical approach is based on common law principles, but most courts today apply less restrictive tests, such as the extreme emotional disturbance test in Model Penal Code jurisdictions.\n\nThe formal distinction between manslaughter and murder begins to emerge in the 16th century. As early as the 1550s, cases appear in law reports that begin to develop the jurisprudence of manslaughter. Provocation began to replace the earlier \"hotbloodedness\" when a landmark case from 1600 established that insults and rude gestures were not sufficient provocation to reduce a murder charge to manslaughter. After this case, judges began developed four common law \"categories\" of provocation:\n"}

She was the grandniece of Moshe Sadka, the Chief Rabbi of Baghdad, and the cousin of Singapore Chief Minister, David Marshall.\n\nShe studied at the Raffles' Girls' School from 1928 to 1935, then joined the special Scholarship Class at Raffles Institute, in 1935, at the age of 16. She was underage for the examination at that time and sat again the following year. In December 1937, it was announced that she had won the British Malayan Queen's Scholarship that provided pass to and back from England, together with the cost of education at Oxford, Cambridge, or any other university, for up to four years. She had been the first Jewish woman to have won this scholarship. Other winners were Lim Chong Eu (18) of the Penang Free School who would go on to become Chief Minister of Penang, Chin Kim Hong (19) of the King Edward VIII School in Taiping and Mohamed Ismail bin Mohamed Ali (19) of Victoria Institution in Selangor. She read modern history at St. Hilda's College, Oxford where she obtained a B.A. (First Class Hons.) in History in 1941.\n\nShe learnt Russian and the Scandinavian languages and in 1942, won a Carnegie Grant to carry out research in Soviet Administration in the former Czarist colonies of Central Asia. In 1946 she had attended the London County Council evening classes in literature and current events and gave a series of talks on the Soviet Union for the Marylebone Literary Institute. She had also served on the committee of the International Youth Centre in London. By September 1947, she was in Australia on break, her work on the subject was nearing completion, and she was planning the presentation of her Ph.D. thesis to take place in England in 1948.\n\nShe joined the University of Malaya as Assistant Lecturer in August 1951.\n\nIn June 1953, she was elected Secretary of the Malayan Historical Society (Singapore) under Professor Cyril Northcote Parkinson.\n\nIn August 1953, the only woman in the team, Sadka, having resigned, left on an expedition headed by Acting Director of Museums Dr. G. de G. Sieveking, to investigate the ancient settlement of Kota Batu, a site at Johore Lama, up the Johore River, and probe the remains of two boats embedded in the river's banks.\n\nPieces of 17th to 18th century Chinese pottery were found among the remains of one of the boats. A local in the area showed them a bowl of Siamese origin that had been found filled with gold coins. According to that owner the coins were subsequently melted down and the gold, sold.\n\nBesides Sadka and Sieveking, the expedition also comprised Dr. Paul Wheatley of the University of Malaya, Dr. C. A. Gibson-Hill of the Raffles Museum, Tony Beamish of Radio Malaya, M. W. F Tweedie of the Singapore Museum, Oswald Theseira of the F.M.S. Museum, Naval Commander-in-Chief (Far East Station) Vice Admiral Sir Charles Lambe, John Senior of the British Army, Wong Lin Ken, Clement Hon, Wang Gung Wu.\n\nThe excavation made an important find. This was the first time that the use of masonry in Malay fortifications had been recorded. Of equal importance, the expedition's surveys allowed for more accurate orientation of the internal geography of that settlement. The remains of an ancient Chinese trading ship were also a result of the excavations there.\n\nSadka was awarded a research scholarship at the National Australian University in 1954.\n\nSadka believed that Hugh Low, third British resident at Perak, was \"one of the greatest of Malaya's administrators,\" but noted that he had been neglected by writers of Malayan history, with only passing references made in the notes made by Swettenham and Winstedt. At that time his private papers could not be located and much of Perak's official records, and those of the Colonial Secretary's Office in Singapore had been destroyed during the Japanese Occupation of Malaya. The only thing, remaining at that time was the first volume of his handwritten journals, at that time kept at the Federal Secretariat in Kuala Lumpur [and now kept at the National Archives of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur], that spanned his first eight weeks in Perak (19 April to 15 June 1877). Sadka worked on deciphering, and transcribing and correcting the text of this manuscript. It was published, two years later, in 1955.\n\nWhile carrying out research at the Australian National University, Sadka discovered that there was enough material in Canberra for students to use as a sound basis of Malayan history. She was, at that time, preparing a thesis on \"The Residential System of Government in the States of Malaya from 1874 to 1895\".\n\nSadka then proceeded to New Zealand where she taught at the Victoria University of Wellington. Sadka's undergraduate class in Southeast Asian history was considered innovative for 1958 New Zealand. Historian Anthony John Stanhope Reid, who had not previously studied history at school, became interested while at the University. He thereafter obtained a B.Econs. in Economics and History (1960) and M.Hist. (1961).\n\nHaving taught there a while, Sadka left New Zealand for Australia and went to Canberra as one of the Australian National University's earliest doctoral candidates. Her thesis, was later revised and published as \"The Protected Malay States 1874-1875.\" She completed her degree in 1966 or 1960.\n\nEmily Sadka died on 19 July 1968 in Perth, Western Australia, the same year her revised thesis in book form, \"The Protected Malay States, 1874-1895,\" was published.\n\nShe had been one of the first students at the Australian National University where she worked on the settlement of north-west Western Australia. Three boxes of her handwritten drafts and extracts from various journals are kept at the National Library of Australia, and at the Australian National University's Library.\n\n"}

{"id": "11318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11318", "title": "FBI Most Wanted Terrorists", "text": "FBI Most Wanted Terrorists\n\nThe FBI Most Wanted Terrorists was a list created and first released on October 10, 2001, with the authority of United States President Bush, following the September 11 attacks on the United States. Initially, the list contained 22 of the top terrorists chosen by the FBI, all of whom had earlier been indicted for acts of terrorism between 1985 and 1998. None of the 22 had been captured by US or other authorities by that date. Of the 22, only Osama bin Laden was by then already listed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.\n\nNo particular legal consequences flowed from the creation of and inclusion on the list. On January 17, 2002, the FBI released a third major FBI wanted list, which has now become known as the FBI Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list, to enlist the public's help in reporting information which may prevent future terrorist attacks. The information sought to be reported is not necessarily relating to any person on any of the FBI wanted lists.\n\nOn the fugitive group wanted poster, the FBI did not list the persons in any particular stated order, except perhaps for the consistent placing of bin Laden in the number one position of the top row. However, the 22 can easily fit into distinct categories of over the two decades, based on the terrorist attacks in which they were, according to US authorities, involved. \n\nFor organization and ease of reference here, the relevant major terrorist attacks are listed by date below, with a brief summary for each, identifying the terror cells most directly responsible for the attack. The 22 on the list are then grouped beneath the attack for which each person was first accused of involvement.\n\nWhereas the Most Wanted Terrorists list is reserved for terrorist fugitives who have been indicted by federal grand juries, the FBI recognized a further need to achieve a much quicker response time in order to prevent any future attacks which may be in the current planning stages. To enlist the public's help in this effort, the FBI sought a way to deliver the early known suspected terror attack information, often very limited, out to the public as quickly as possible. So, on January 17, 2002, the third major FBI wanted list was first released, which has now become known as the FBI Seeking Information – Terrorism list.\n\nAs the name of this list implies, the FBI's intent is to acquire any critical information from the public, as soon as possible, about the suspected terrorists, who may be in the planning stages of terror attacks against United States nationals at home and abroad. The first such list profiled five persons about whom little was known, but who were suspected of plotting terrorist attacks in martyrdom operations. The main evidence against the five was five videos they had produced, found in the rubble of Mohammed Atef's destroyed home outside Kabul, Afghanistan.\n\nBy 2006, more than four years had passed since the FBI had listed the original 22 alleged terrorists on the Most Wanted Terrorist list. Of those 22, by then four had been qualified for removal from the list, due to death or capture. Also by then, the FBI determined that new persons qualified to be listed as Most Wanted Terrorists. Some of these persons were indicted for attacks and plots that had taken place since the original list had been compiled. The original indictments had been for incidents only through 1998. Since then, the U.S. had become victim to at least two major terror attacks, which would generate some of the new indictments for the Most Wanted Terrorists, notably:\n\n\nIn addition, after the original 2001 list had been compiled and released to the public, the U.S. had foiled and issued indictments for numerous other plots, involving some new listed Most Wanted Terrorists. Those notable other plots involved:\n\nIn February 2006, the FBI completed two groups of additions to the Most Wanted Terrorists list, the first such additions in over four years. On February 24, 2006, the day after adding two name to the list, the FBI added an additional six fugitive terrorists, for various plots and attacks. One of the entries was for an indictment dating back to the June 14, 1985, hijacking of TWA flight 847 by Hezbollah (see above).\n\nAdditionally, the FBI also added to the Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list an additional three persons, most notably, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the notorious leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. This marked the first time that al-Zarqawi had appeared on any of the three major FBI wanted lists. On June 8, 2006, ABC News reported that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was confirmed to have been killed in Baghdad in a bombing raid by a United States task force. His death was confirmed by multiple sources in Iraq, including the United States government.\n\nSince 1984, the United States government has also used the Rewards for Justice Program, which pays monetary rewards of up to $5 million, or now, in some cases more, upon special authorization by the United States Secretary of State, to individuals who provide information which substantially leads to countering of terrorist attacks against United States persons. More than $100 million had been paid to over 60 people through this program.\n\nThe Rewards for Justice Program was established by the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism, Public Law 98-533, and is administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, within the U.S. Department of State.\n\n\n\n"}

It is also used for financial reporting by business and other organizations. Laws in many jurisdictions require company financial reports to be prepared and published on an annual basis, but generally do \"not\" require the reporting period to align with the calendar year (1 January to 31 December). Taxation laws generally require accounting records to be maintained and taxes calculated on an annual basis, which usually corresponds to the fiscal year used for government purposes. The calculation of tax on an annual basis is especially relevant for direct taxation, such as income tax. Many annual government fees—such as Council rates, licence fees, etc.—are also levied on a fiscal year basis, while others are charged on an anniversary basis.\n\nThe \"fiscal year end\" (FYE) is the date that marks the end of the fiscal year. Some companies—such as Cisco Systems—end their fiscal year on the same day of the week each year, e.g. the day that is closest to a particular date (for example, the Friday closest to 31 December). Under such a system, some fiscal years will have 52 weeks and others 53 weeks.\n\nThe calendar year is used as the fiscal year by about 65% of publicly traded companies in the United States and for a majority of large corporations in the UK and elsewhere, with notable exceptions being in Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\n\nMany universities have a fiscal year which ends during the summer to align the fiscal year with the academic year (and, in some cases involving public universities, with the state government's fiscal year), and because the university is normally less busy during the summer months. In the northern hemisphere this is July to the next June. In the southern hemisphere this is calendar year, January to December. Some media/communication-based organizations use a broadcast calendar as the basis for their fiscal year.\n\nThe fiscal year is usually denoted by the year in which it ends, so United States federal government spending incurred on 14 November 2018 would belong to fiscal year , operating on a fiscal calendar of October–September.\n\nThe fiscal year for individuals and entities to report and pay income taxes is often known as the taxpayer's tax year or taxable year. Taxpayers in many jurisdictions may choose their tax year. Some federal countries, such as Canada and Switzerland, require the provincial or cantonal tax year to align with the federal year. In the United States, most states retained a June 30 fiscal year-end date when the federal government switched to September 30 in 1976. Nearly all jurisdictions require that the tax year be 12 months or 52/53 weeks. However, short years are permitted as the first year or when changing tax years.\n\nMost countries require all individuals to pay income tax based on the calendar year. Significant exceptions include:\n\nMany jurisdictions require that the tax year conform to the taxpayer's fiscal year for financial reporting. The United States is a notable exception: taxpayers may choose any tax year, but must keep books and records for such year.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, particularly those that permit tax consolidation, companies that are part of a group of businesses must use nearly the same fiscal year (differences of up to three months are permitted in some jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and Japan), with consolidating entries to adjust for transactions between units with different fiscal years, so the same resources will not be counted more than once or not at all.\n\nIn Afghanistan, the fiscal year was recently changed from 1 Hamal – 29 Hoot (21 March – 20 March) to 1 Jadi – 30 Qaus (21 December – 20 December). The fiscal year runs with the Afghan or Solar Hijri calendar, because of the differing cycle of leap years in the Gregorian and Afghan calendars, there can be slight differences in the start date of fiscal (and calendar) years. As shown in the chart below, leap years will coincide in 2020 and 2024 but will desynchronize with the Gregorian calendar having a leap year in 2028 as opposed to the Afghan calendar's leap year of 2029.\n\nCorrespondence of Solar Hijri and Gregorian calendars (Solar Hijri leap years are marked *)\nIn Australia, a fiscal year is commonly called a \"financial year\" (FY) and starts on 1 July and ends on the next 30 June. Financial years are designated by the calendar year of the second half of the period. For example, financial year 2017 is the 12-month period ending on 30 June 2017 and can be referred to as FY2016/17. It is used for official purposes, by individual taxpayers and by the overwhelming majority of business enterprises. Business enterprises may opt to use a financial year that ends at the end of a week (e.g., 52 or 53 weeks in length, and therefore is not exactly one calendar year in length), or opt for its financial year to end on a date that matches the reporting cycle of its foreign parent. All entities within the one group must use the same financial year.\n\nFor government accounting and budget purposes, pre-Federation colonies changed the financial year from the calendar year to a year ending 30 June on the following dates: Victoria changed in 1870, South Australia in 1874, Queensland in 1875, Western Australia in 1892, New South Wales in 1895 and Tasmania in 1904. The Commonwealth adopted the near-ubiquitous financial year standard since its inception in 1901. The reason given for the change was for convenience, as Parliament typically sits during May and June, while it was difficult for it to meet in November and December to pass a budget.\n\nThe Financial year is split into the following four quarters \nIn Austria the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the fiscal year is 1 July to the next 30 June.\n\nIn Belarus, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Brazil, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Bulgaria, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December, both for personal income tax and for corporate taxes.\n\nIn Canada, the government's financial year is 1 April to 31 March. <br>(Q1 1 April - 30 June, Q2 1 July - 30 Sept, Q3 1 Oct - 31 Dec and Q4 1 Jan - 31 Mar)\n\nFor individual taxpayers, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn China, the fiscal year for all entities is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December, and applies to the tax year, statutory year, and planning year.\n\nIn Colombia, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Costa Rica, the fiscal year is 1 October to 30 September.\n\nIn the Arab Republic of Egypt, the fiscal year is 1 July to 30 June.\n\nIn France, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December, and has been since at least 1911.\n\nIn Greece, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the government's financial year runs from 1 April to 31 March.\n\nIn India, the government's financial year runs from 1 April to 31 March.

For example, Standard Chartered's IDR follows the UK calendar despite being listed in India. Companies following Indian fiscal year get to know their economical health on 31 March of every Indian financial or fiscal year.\n\nThe current fiscal year was adopted by the colonial British government in 1867 to align India's financial year with that of the British Empire. Prior to 1867, India followed a fiscal year that ran from 1 May to 30 April.\n\nIn 1984, the LK Jha committee recommended adopting a fiscal year that ran from 1 January to 31 December. However, this proposal was not adopted by the government fearing possible issues during the transition period. A panel set up by the NITI Aayog in July 2016, recommended starting the next fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December after the end of the current five-year plan.\n\nOn 4 May 2017, Madhya Pradesh announced that it would move to a January–December financial year, becoming the first Indian state to do so. But later it dropped the idea.\n\nIn Indonesia, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Iran, the fiscal year usually starts on 21 March (1st of Farvardin) and concludes on next year's 20 March (29th of Esfand) in \n\nUntil 2001, the fiscal year in Ireland was the year ending 5 April, as in the United Kingdom. From 2002, to coincide with the introduction of the euro, it was changed to the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December. The 2001 tax year was nine months, from April to December.\n\nIn Israel, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Italy, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December. It was changed in 1965, before which it was 1 July to 30 June.\n\nIn Japan, the government's financial year is from 1 April to 31 March. The fiscal year is represented by the calendar year in which the period begins, followed by the word \"nendo\" (年度); for example the fiscal year from 1 April to 31 March is called –\"nendo\".\n\nJapan's income tax year is 1 January to 31 December, but corporate tax is charged according to the corporation's own annual period.\n\nIn Macau, the government's financial year is 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Mexico, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Myanmar, the fiscal year is 1 October to 30 September.\n\nIn Nepal, the fiscal year is 1 Shrawan (4th month of Bikram calendar) to 31 Ashad (3rd month of Bikram calendar). Shrawan 1 roughly falls in mid-July.\n\nIn New Zealand, the government's fiscal and financial reporting year is 1 July to the next 30 June and applies also to the budget. The company and personal financial year is 1 April to 31 March and applies to company and personal income tax.\n\nThe Pakistani government's fiscal year is 1 July of the previous calendar year and concludes on 30 June.

The Act also provides for certain classes of taxpayers to have a year of assessment ending on a day other than the last day of February. Companies are permitted to have a tax year ending on a date that coincides with their financial year. Many older companies still use a tax year that runs from 1 July to 30 June, inherited from the British system. A common practice for newer companies is to run their tax year from 1 March to the final day of February following, to synchronize with the tax year for individuals.\n\nIn South Korea, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Spain, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Sweden, the fiscal year for individuals is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nThe fiscal year for an organisation is typically one of the following:\n\nHowever, all calendar months are allowed. If an organisation wishes to change into a non-calendar year, permission from the Tax Authority is required.\n\nIn Taiwan, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December. However, an enterprise may elect to adopt a special fiscal year at the time it is established and can request approval from the tax authorities to change its fiscal year.\n\nIn Thailand, the government's fiscal year (FY) is 1 October to 30 September of the following year. For individual taxpayers it is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn Ukraine, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, the fiscal year is the calendar year, 1 January to 31 December.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the financial year runs from 1 April to 31 March for the purposes of government financial statements. For personal tax purposes the fiscal year starts on 6 April and ends on 5 April of the next calendar year.\nAlthough United Kingdom corporation tax is charged by reference to the government's financial year, companies can adopt any year as their accounting year: if there is a change in tax rate, the taxable profit is apportioned to financial years on a time basis.\n\nA number of major corporations that were once government-owned, such as BT Group and the National Grid, continue to use the government's financial year, which ends on the last day of March, as they have found no reason to change since privatisation.\nThe 5 April year end for personal tax and benefits reflects the old ecclesiastical calendar, with New Year falling on 25 March (\"Lady Day\"), the difference being accounted for by the eleven days \"missed out\" when Great Britain converted from the Julian Calendar to the Gregorian Calendar in September 1752 (the British tax authorities, and landlords were unwilling to lose 11 days of tax and rent revenue, so under provision 6 (\"Times of Payment of Rents, Annuities, &c.\") of the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750, the 1752–3 tax year was extended by 11 days). From 1753 until 1799, the tax year in Great Britain began on 5 April, which was the \"old style\" new year of 25 March. A 12th skipped Julian leap day in 1800 changed its start to 6 April. It was not changed when a 13th Julian leap day was skipped in 1900, so the start of the personal tax year in the United Kingdom is still 6 April.\n\nThe United States federal government's fiscal year is the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 the following year. The identification of a fiscal year is the calendar year in which it ends; thus, the current fiscal year is , often written as \"FY\" or \"FY\", which began on 1 October and will end on 30 September .\n\nPrior to 1976, the fiscal year began on 1 July and ended on 30 June. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 made the change to allow Congress more time to arrive at a budget each year, and provided for what is known as the \"transitional quarter\" from 1 July 1976 to 30 September 1976. An earlier shift in the federal government's fiscal year was made in 1843, shifting the fiscal year from a calendar year to one starting on 1 July.\n\nFor example, the United States government fiscal year for is:\n\n\nState governments set their own fiscal year. Forty-six of the fifty states set their fiscal year to end on June 30. Four states have fiscal years that end on a different date:\n\n\nThe fiscal year for the Washington, D.C. government ends on September 30.\n\nAmong the inhabited territories of the United States, most align with the federal fiscal year, ending on September 30. These include American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico is the exception, with its fiscal year ending on June 30.\n\nThe tax year for a business is governed by the fiscal year it chooses. A business may choose any consistent fiscal year that it wants; however, for seasonal businesses such as farming and retail, a good account practice is to end the fiscal year shortly after the highest revenue time of year. Consequently, most large agriculture companies end their fiscal years after the harvest season, and most retailers end their fiscal years shortly after the Christmas shopping season.\n\n\n"}

The period is generally considered to have begun in either the mid-to-late 1990s, or the early 2000s. It is believed to have resulted from advances in technologies of media distribution, as well as a large increase in the number of hours of available television, which has prompted a major wave of content creation.\n\nIts name refers to the original Golden Age of Television which occurred in the 1950s. It has also been referred to as the \"New\", \"Second\" or \"Third Golden Age of Television\" (\"third\" being used when a period in the early 1980s is considered a second Golden Age).\n\nFrench scholar Alexis Pichard has argued that TV series enjoyed a Second Golden Age in the early 1990s which was a combination of three elements: first, an improvement in both visual aesthetics and storytelling; second, an overall homogeneity between cable series and networks series; and third, a tremendous popular success. Alexis Pichard contends that this Second Golden Age was the result of a revolution initiated by the traditional networks in the 1980s and carried on by the cable channels (especially HBO) in the 1990s.\n\nShows such as \"The Sopranos\" (which first aired in 1999), \"Six Feet Under\" (2001), \"The Wire\" (2002), \"Battlestar Galactica\" and \"Lost\" (2004), \"Mad Men\" (2007), \"Breaking Bad\" (2008) and \"Game of Thrones\" (2011), are generally considered the basis of the so-called Golden Age of Television, i.e. the new creator-driven tragic dramas of the 2000s and 2010s. The Writer's Guild of America vote for 101 Best Written TV Shows includes a complete foundation of the current Golden Age of Television. \n\nStephanie Zacharek of \"The Village Voice\" has argued that the current golden age began earlier with network shows like \"Babylon 5\" and \"\" (both of which premiered in 1993), and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1997). Kirk Hamilton of \"Kotaku\" has said that \"\" (2005) should be considered a part of the golden age of television, and recommended \"the sophisticated kids show\" to others. With the rise of instant access to content on Netflix, creator-driven television shows like \"Breaking Bad\", \"The Shield\" (2002), \"Friday Night Lights\" (2006) and \"Mad Men\" gained cult followings that grew to become widely popular. The success of instant access to television shows was presaged by the popularity of DVDs, and continues to increase with the rise of digital platforms and online companies.\n\nThe increase in the number of shows is also cited as evidence of a Golden Age. In the five years between 2011 and 2016, the number of scripted television shows, on broadcast, cable and digital platforms increased by 71%. In 2002, 182 television shows aired, while 2016 saw 455 original scripted television shows with an additional increase projected for 2017. The number of shows are rising largely due to companies like Netflix, Amazon Video and Hulu investing heavily in original content. The number of shows aired by online service increased from only one in 2009 to over 93 in 2016. John Landgraf, the CEO of FX Networks, has stated that the United States has reached \"peak television\", where the amount of television series being aired could be overwhelming for the viewer to choose from, especially for critics obligated to review as many shows as possible, which results in a decreased output of television series in the future.\n\n\n"}

Later he left to study at the University of Paris where he met Erasmus, with whom he became close friends while they were both students at the austere Collège de Montaigu, to whose reforming Master, Jan Standonck, Boece later became Secretary. By 1497 he had become a professor of philosophy at Collège de Montaigu.\n\nIn 1500, he was induced to leave Paris for Aberdeen by a generously financed offer to become the first principal of the newly established University of Aberdeen, created at the behest of James IV by William Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen under the authority of a Papal bull issued by Pope Alexander VI.\n\nFrom then onwards, he worked closely with Elphinstone, to set up the new university and by 1505, regular lectures were taking place at King's College. The university structure was modelled on those of Paris and of Orléans. As intended, Boece was installed as the first principal of the university and gave lectures on medicine and on divinity.\n\nAt the end of 1534, Boece became Rector of Fyvie. He died in Aberdeen two years later at the age of 71.\n\nBoece wrote and published two books, one of biography and one of history. In 1522 he published the \"Vitae Episcoporum Murthlacensium et Aberdonensium\" \"(Lives of the Bishops of Murthlack and Aberdeen\") and in 1527 the \"Historia Gentis Scotorum\" (\"History of the Scottish People\") to the accession of James III of Scotland. The former was the basis of a poem in Scots by Alexander Gardyne.\n\nThe \"Historia\" is the work for which Boece is remembered, as the second scholarly history of the Scots to be written; its only real predecessor was the compendium of John Mair. It was written in a flowing and pleasing style, became popular, and led to ecclesiastical preferment and royal favour. By modern standards it is overly patriotic, and has many inaccuracies. The historical account of Macbeth of Scotland, in particular, flattered the antecedents of Boece's patron King James IV of Scotland, and greatly maligned the real Macbeth. The work was well received at the time, both in Europe and in Scotland, after its translation from Latin into French and then in 1536 from Latin into Scots by John Bellenden (which is the oldest book of prose written in Scots to survive into modern times). There are some glimpses in the \"Historia\" of contemporary Scotland, such as the statement that the Eurasian beaver, which was soon to become extinct in Scotland, was still common around Loch Ness.\n\nBoece's \"Historia\" as published terminated in 1438. In the early 1530s the scholar Giovanni Ferrerio, engaged by Robert Reid of Kinloss Abbey, wrote a continuation of Boece's history, extending it another 50 years, to the end of the reign of James III. John Lesley in his \"De Origine, Moribus, et Rebus Gestis Scotorum\", and Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, provided further continuations. The metrical translation into Scots by William Stewart, not published until the nineteenth century, also provided some expansion.\n\nThe chronicler Polydore Vergil made some use of Boece for his 1534 \"Historia Anglica\". David Chalmers of Ormond in his \"Histoire abbregée\" (1572) wrote about the French, English and Scottish monarchies, relying on Boece for the Scottish account. The \"Historia\" was translated into English for Raphael Holinshed's \"Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland\". The account in Holinshed's \"Chronicle\" was then used by William Shakespeare as the basis of his play \"Macbeth\". George Buchanan made heavy use of Boece in his \"Rerum Scoticarum Historia\" (1582).\n\nBoece's claimed sources fell into three classes. The works of John Fordun (\"Chronica Gentis Scotorum\") and Walter Bower (\"Scotichronicon\") defined the tradition which he attempted to make seamless, filling the gaps in the chronicle, and applying the approach common to humanists of his period. The works of Tacitus had been rediscovered, in the 14th century, and contained material relevant to British history; and Boece was concerned to integrate it into the tradition. Finally there was a group of sources that remain debated: material from Elphinstone, and the authors Veremundus, Cornelius Hibernicus, and John Campbell. No written record of these works survives.\n\nSharp criticism of the sourcing of Boece's history was voiced in the sixteenth century by Humphrey Lhuyd and John Twyne. In the eighteenth century the historical content of the earlier parts of work was effectively dismantled by Thomas Innes.\n\nBoece shared in the credulity of his age; the approach of Mair, who was writing in parallel at the same time, but with a different focus and with a more critical and less sweeping method, did not represent the current fashion. The charge of actually inventing his authorities, formerly brought against Boece, has been the subject of recent scholarship. One example of Boece being cleared of the charge of fabricating his work concerns the Battle of Luncarty Luncarty Clan Hay. He was suspected by the Scottish historian John Hill Burton of inventing that battle but, Walter Bower writing in his \"Scotichronicon\" around 1440, some 87 years before Boece first published his Scotorum Historia, refers to the battle briefly. The \"John Campbell\" is tentatively identified as Boece's contemporary John Campbell of Lundie (died 1562). \"Veremundus\", it is argued, may be a Richard Vairement of the 13th century.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She holds the distinction as the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States.\n\nHelen Magill was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Edward Hicks Magill and Sarah Warner Beans. She was the eldest of six children in a Quaker family. Magill was brought up to believe that she deserved the same education as a man and all five Magill daughters were educated to become college teachers. In 1859, the family moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where Magill enrolled as the only female student in the Boston Public Latin School. Her father taught French and Latin there for three years, and he was promoted to submaster.\n\nIn 1869, Magill's father joined the faculty of the new Swarthmore College which was founded by Quakers in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. Magill enrolled as an undergraduate. In 1871 her father was selected as the college's second president, serving for 17 years. The younger Magill graduated as a member of the Class of 1873, Swarthmore's first graduating class (five women and one man).\n\nMagill attended graduate school at Boston University, earning her Ph.D. in Greek in 1877. She was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in the United States. Magill traveled to England, studying at the University of Cambridge and placing third in her 1881 tripos (honors examinations) at Newnham College.\n\nMagill's dissertation, \"The Greek Drama\", was long considered lost but it has been found in her papers in the Rare Book and Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library in 2018.\n\nAfter serving as the principal for a year at a private school in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Magill was selected on the recommendation of Edward Everett Hale to organize Howard Collegiate Institute in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts in 1883. Howard was a non-sectarian school for about forty women and Magill had the authority to choose teachers and conduct college courses. Magill's father contributed funds for a laboratory and gymnasium and two of Magill's sisters taught courses. Although the school expanded rapidly (and therefore needed a new building to accommodate students), Magill resigned in 1887 due to family reasons and due to a dispute with the trustees over her campaign for the provision of better sewerage.\n\nMagill taught for a short amount of time at Evelyn College for Women, a women's annex to Princeton University. Suffering from an illness, she taught physical geography at Brooklyn High School for a few years.\n\nHelen Magill met Andrew D. White in 1887 while she was presenting a paper about her time at Newnham College at the American Social Science Association. A college classmate of Magill's father, White was retired from his many years as first president of Cornell University. He had been widowed that year. White described Magill and her paper in his diary as:\"Perfect manner & exquisite voice - altogether a triumph for this little Quakeress - daughter of my college mate Magill - of which I am proud.\"White encouraged Magill to apply for the post of Director of Sage College for Women at Cornell University. Magill however had been shaken by her experience of directorship of the Howard Collegiate Institute and depression and illness kept her at home for some time. While teaching at Brooklyn High School, Magill maintained a correspondence with White where she commented on her perceived failings:\"but it makes me miserable sometimes to think what I might have already done, if I had produced more and criticized less.\" (May 15th 1888)Magill and White married in September 1890, and had three children, Edward Magill White (died 1896), Hilda White (1891-1892), and Karin Andreevna White (1893-1971).\n\nMagill accompanied her husband when he was appointed to diplomatic posts in St. Petersburg (1892–94) and Berlin (1897–1903). Magill was presented at both courts and was a noted conversationalist, discussing architecture, sculpture, music, and literature with Kaisar Wilhelm II. Following the family's return to the United States, Magill did not participate in public or academic life any further.\n\nHelen Magill White published a letter in 1913 opposing women's suffrage. However, some historians believe she was expressing her opposition to the actions of the Women's Social and Political Union in England, rather than to the suffrage cause. The Union's militant acts included burning churches, bombing homes, and sending letter bombs to public officials.\n\nAfter Andrew D. White died in 1918, Magill lived abroad and in Ithaca, New York. She retired to Kittery Point, Maine, where she died in 1944.\n\n"}

Italy has been influential at a coinage point of view: the florin, one of the most used coinage types in European history, was struck in Florence in the 13th century. Since Italy has been for centuries divided into many city-states, they all had different coinage systems, but when the country became unified in 1861, the Italian lira came into place, and was used until 2002. Today, Italy uses the Euro.\n\nDespite the fact that the first Italian coinage systems were used in the Magna Graecia and Etruscan civilization, the Romans introduced a widespread currency. Unlike most modern coins, Roman coins had intrinsic value. While they contained precious metals, the value of a coin was higher than its precious metal content, so they were not bullion. Estimates of their value range from 1.6 to 2.85 times their metal content, thought to equal the purchasing power of 10 modern British Pound Sterling (US$15) at the beginning of the Roman Empire to around 18 Pound Sterling (US$29) by its end (comparing bread, wine and meat prices) and, over the same period, around one to three days' pay for a Legionnaire.\n\nThe florin was struck from 1252 to 1523 with no significant change in its design or metal content standard. It had 54 grains of gold (3.5g). The \"fiorino d'oro\" of the Republic of Florence was the first European gold coin struck in sufficient quantities to play a significant commercial role since the seventh century. As many Florentine banks were international supercompanies with branches across Europe, the florin quickly became the dominant trade coin of Western Europe for large scale transactions, replacing silver bars in multiples of the mark (a weight unit equal to eight troy ounces).\n\nIn the fourteenth century, one hundred and fifty European states and local coin issuing authorities made their own copies of the florin. The most important of these was the Hungarian forint because the Kingdom of Hungary was a major source of gold mined in Europe (until the New World began to contribute to the supply in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, most of the gold used in Europe came from Africa).\n\nThe early modern Italian coins were very similar in style to French francs, especially in decimals, since it was ruled by the country in the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. They corresponded to a value of 0.29 of gold or 4.5 grams of silver.\n\nThe Papal States scudo was the coinage system used in the Papal States until 1866. Between 1798 and 1799, the revolutionary French forces established the Roman Republic, which issued coins denominated in baiocco and scudo. In addition, the states of Ancona, Civitavecchia, Clitunno, Foligno, Gubbio, Pergola and Perugia changed their coinage system to that of the Roman Republic.\n\nIn 1808, the Papal States were annexed by France, and French francs circulated as the official coins. When the Pope's authority was restored in 1814, the scudo was restored as the currency. However, the coinage of the individual states was not resumed. In 1849, another Roman Republic was established which issued coins centrally and in Ancona.\n\nIn 1866, the scudo was replaced by the lira, equivalent to the Italian lira. The exchange rate used was 5.375 lire = 1 scudo.\n\nThe Parman lira was Parma's official currency before 1802, and later revived from 1815 to 1859. The Duchy of Parma had its own coinage system until it was made a part of France in 1802. This lira was subdivided into 20 \"soldi\" (singular: \"soldo\"), each of 12 \"denari\" (singular: \"denaro\"), with the \"sesino\" worth 6 denari and the \"ducato\" was worth 7 lire. The currency was replaced by the French franc.\n\nAfter the re-establishment of Parman independence, the Parman currency system was introduced in 1815. Also called the lira, it was subdivided into 20 \"soldi\" or 100 \"centesimi\". However, this lira was equal to the French franc and the Sardinian lira, and it circulated alongside the latter. It weighed 5 grams, and had a purity of 9/10 of silver. Since 1861, Parma has used the equivalent Italian lira.\n\nThe Neapolitan piastra was the most common silver coin of the Kingdom of Naples. In order to distinguish it from the piastra issued on the island of Sicily, it is referred to as the \"Neapolitan piastra\" as opposed to the \"Sicilian piastra\". These two piastra were equal but were subdivided differently. The Neapolitan piastra was divided into 120 \"grana\" (singular: \"grano\"), each of 2 \"tornesi\" (singular: \"tornese\") or 12 \"cavalli\" (singular: \"cavallo\"). There were also the \"carlino\" worth 10 grana and the \"ducato\" worth 100 grana.\n\nThe Two Sicilies piastra was the coinage system or currency of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies between 1815 and 1860. It was subdivided into 120 \"grana\" (singular: \"grano\"), each of 2 \"tornesi\" (singular: \"tornese\"). Accounts were kept in \"ducato\", worth 100 grana.\n\nThe Sardinian lira was the currency of the Kingdom of Sardinia between 1816 and 1861. It was subdivided into 100 \"centesimi\" (singular \"centesimo \") and was equal in value to the French franc, which had replaced the Piedmontese and Sardinian scudos by 1799. It was replaced at par by the Italian lira.\n\nThe Tuscan fiorino was the currency of Tuscany between 1826 and 1859. It was subdivided into 100 \"quattrini\" (singular: \"quattrino\"), with an additional denomination called the \"paolo\", worth 40 quattrini, in circulation.\n\nThe Lombardy-Venetia florins were the coins of Lombardy-Venetia (reduced to the sole Venetia three years before) between 1862 and 1866. It replaced the pound at a rate of 1 florin = 3 pounds. The florin was equivalent to the Austro-Hungarian gulden (also called the florin). Although it was subdivided into 100 \"soldi\" rather than 100 Kreuzer, Austrian coins circulated in Venetia. The only coins issued specifically for Venetia were copper ½ and 1 soldo pieces.\n\nThe lira was made the official currency of Italy in 1861 after the Italian unification, however stopped being used in 2002. The euro coinage system entered circulation in Italy in 2002 and is currently the official currency.\n\nUpon the creation of the Kingdom of Italy under Vittorio Emanuele II (1861), a unified lira was established, at 4.5 grams of silver or 290.322 milligrams of gold. This was a direct continuation of the Sardinian lira. Other currencies replaced by the Italian lira included the Lombardy-Venetia pound, the Two Sicilies piastra, the Tuscan fiorino, the Papal States scudo and the Parman lira. In 1865, Italy formed part of the Latin Monetary Union in which the lira was set as equal to, among others, the French, Belgian and Swiss francs: in fact, until the introduction of the euro in 2002, people speaking the Gallo-Italic dialects in north-western Italy usually called \"franc\" the lira.\n\nWorld War I broke the Latin Monetary Union and resulted in prices rising severalfold in Italy. Inflation was curbed somewhat by Mussolini, who, on 18 August 1926, declared that the exchange rate between lira and pound would be £1 = 90 lire—the so-called Quota 90, although the free exchange rate had been closer to 140–150 lire per pound. In 1927, the lira was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 1 dollar = 19 lire. This rate lasted until 1934, with a separate \"tourist\" rate of US$1 = 24.89 lire being established in 1936. In 1939, the \"official\" rate was 19.8 lire.\n\nAfter the Allied invasion of Italy, an exchange rate was set at US$1 = 120 lire (1 British pound = 480 lire) in June 1943, reduced to 100 lire the following month. In German occupied areas, the exchange rate was set at 1 Reichsmark = 10 lire.\n\nAfter the war, the Roman mint first issued the first 1, 2, 5 and 10 lira coins (6 September 1946). They were officially set up on 21 December of the same year and were used up to 1953–4. The value of the lira fluctuated, before Italy set a peg of US$1 = 575 lire within the Bretton Woods System in November 1947. Following the devaluation of the pound, Italy devalued to US$1 = 625 lire on 21 September 1949. This rate was maintained until the end of the Bretton Woods System in the early 1970s. Several episodes of high inflation followed until the lira was replaced by the euro.\n\nThe lira was the official unit of currency in Italy until 1 January 1999, when it was replaced by the euro (euro coins and notes were not introduced until 2002). Old lira denominated currency ceased to be legal tender on 28 February 2002. The conversion rate is 1,936.27 lire to the euro.\nAll lira banknotes in use immediately before the introduction of the euro, as all post WW2 coins, are still exchangeable for euros in all branches of the Bank of Italy until 29 February 2012.\n\nThe euro officially began circulating in Italy on 1 January 2002 (even though the creation of Italian lira coins was suspended in 1999). Italian euro coins have a design unique to each denomination, though there are many themes of works by one of the most renowned and famous Italian artists and painters. Each coin is designed by a different designer, from the 1 cent to the 2 euro coin they are: Eugenio Driutti, Luciana De Simoni, Ettore Lorenzo Frapiccini, Claudia Momoni, Maria Angela Cassol, Roberto Mauri, Laura Cretara and Maria Carmela Colaneri. All designs feature the 12 stars of the EU, the year of imprint, the overlapping letters \"RI\" for \"Repubblica Italiana\" (Italian Republic) and the letter R for Rome. There are no Italian euro coins dated earlier than \"2002\", even though they were certainly minted earlier, as they were first distributed to the public in December 2001.\n\n"}

It is an independent scientific institute in Amsterdam. The IISG is part of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. It was founded in 1935 by Nicolaas Posthumus. The large archives of the institute (ca. 50 km) harbor invaluable and extensive papers of several international social movements and currents, including papers of individuals such as Rosa Luxemburg, Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin.\n\nThe International Institute of Social History was founded in 1935 by Nicolaas Posthumus. To examine how labour relations develop over time, IISG collected archives from all over the world. During the first years Posthumus succeeded in obtaining many papers from anarchists (Bakunin manuscripts), other socialist and social democratic and Marxist movements from Germany and Russia.\n\nBefore the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Posthumus was able to move the most valuable archives to London. During the war, many remaining IISG archives were transported to Nazi Germany. They were not destroyed. Most of the papers were rediscovered in Hannover in 1946, and some other parts were later found in archives in Moscow in 1991, and returned to Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1989 the International Institute of Social History moved to new premises: an old warehouse at the Cruquiusweg in the eastern part of Amsterdam. This building also housed the Press Museum but in 2017 that museum became a part of the Dutch Institute for Image and Sound (Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid) in Hilversum. \n\nThe personal archives at the International Institute of Social History are extensive, including (among many others) the collections of the papers of Diego Abad de Santillán, Alexander Atabekian, Angelica Balabanoff, Bernt Carlsson, Ruth Fischer, Emma Goldman, Rudolf Hilferding, Karl Kautsky, Gustav Landauer, Arthur Lehning, Max Nettlau, Theodor Liebknecht, Toma Sik, Andre Gunder Frank and Leon Trotsky.\n\nThere are also many institutional archives, among which the archives of the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party, the Red Army Faction and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (well over 200 m.). One of its most famous archives are the archives of the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and its political arm, the Federación Anarquista Ibérica (FAI). These archives were smuggled out of Spain during the Spanish Civil War and made their way to Paris branch of the IISG in secret. The archives contain information regarding military activities, correspondence and financial documents. Other anarchist archives were destroyed during the war or remain lost which makes these collection in the IISG all the more valuable. \n\nIn the last decades the IISG also acquired the archives of Greenpeace and Amnesty International.\n\nA related institution is the Swiss Social Archives in Zurich.\n\nHistorian of anarchism Paul Avrich wrote that the institute is the foremost repository of anarchist documents in the world.\n\n\n"}

When the French invaded under Napoleon I, at the start of the Peninsular War (1808-1814), Burgos, as one of the \"afrancesados\" (supporters of King Joseph I), took up administrative duties in Andalusia. His willingness to collaborate had made him an enemy of the House of Bourbon, and made him leave for Paris in 1812.\n\nIn France, Burgos completed his academic training by studying the works of the Classics, and started translating the works of Horace into Castilian (a version notably analysed by Andrés Bello, who deemed Burgos \"a poor translator, but an excellent commentator\"). Much later (1844), Burgos published a revised version, which, although still flawed, has remained a reference - for instance, it is appreciated for its use of the sapphic stanza with free verse.\n\nHe returned to Madrid in 1819, and was appointed editor of \"El Imparcial\" in 1822 (the paper was a rallying point for moderate liberalism and the \"afrancesados\"). During the same period, Burgos showed himself to be a prolific author, writing a publishing a multiple volume work entitled \"Biografía universal\". He was also integrated in the Bourbon administration of Ferdinand VII, being appointed undersecretary of State in Francisco Cea Bermúdez's Ministry. Under the regency of Maria Christina, as the driving force behind the 1833 territorial division of Spain, Burgos used his influence to turn Spain's previous administrative system into a provincial one, advocating for the need of a centralized government. However, his design overtly conflicted with the self-government status held by the Basque districts, especially with Navarre, heavily conditioned but still a free-standing Kingdom. The move was approved in November–December 1833, the same year he became Home Minister.\n\nHe was a senator of the \"Moderado\" liberals regime established during the reign of Isabella II, as well as a royal counsellor and Interior Minister for the first government of Ramón María Narváez y Campos, Duke of Valencia. His office as Minister was taken over by Narváez's successor, Francisco Javier Istúriz.\n\nHe also wrote poems marking events such as the death of María Isabel de Braganza and the wedding of Ferdinand VII and Maria Christina, as well as the notable \"Oda a la Razón\".\n\n"}

He was decended from early Tasmanian and New Zealand colonial settlers, and was of Irish descent on his father's side. Stacpoole was educated at Mount Albert Grammar School in Auckland from 1932 to 1935, becoming head librarian and a member of the school's hockey 1st XI. He later studied architecture at Auckland University College where he was a contemporary of Stephen Jelicich and Anthony Treadwell.\n\nDuring World War II, Stacpoole served as an officer in the 2nd Battalion, Auckland Regiment. However, he contracted tuberculosis and spent 18 months of the war in hospital.\n\nFollowing a period working in architectural practices in Auckland and London, Stacpoole joined the architectural division of the Ministry of Works, and soon became the advisory architect to the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. He served on the latter organisation's council and as chair of its buildings classification committee.

He was educated at the New Academy and afterwards at the Marischal College, in Aberdeen, where his father was manager of the Commercial Bank.\n\nAfter attending classes at Edinburgh University (1825–1826), Blackie spent three years at Aberdeen as a student of theology. In 1829 he went to Germany, and after studying at Göttingen and Berlin (where he came under the influence of Heeren, Otfried Müller, Schleiermacher, Neander and Böckh) he accompanied Bunsen to Italy and Rome. The years spent abroad extinguished his former wish to enter the Church, and at his father's desire he gave himself up to the study of law.\n\nHe had already, in 1824, been placed in a lawyer's office, but only remained there six months. By the time he was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates (1834) he had acquired a strong love of the classics and a taste for letters in general. A translation of Goethe's \"Faust\", which he published in 1834, met with considerable success, winning the approbation of Carlyle. After a year or two of desultory literary work he was (May 1839) appointed to the newly instituted chair of Humanity (Latin) in the Marischal College.\n\nDifficulties arose in the way of his installation, owing to the action of the Presbytery on his refusing to sign unreservedly the Confession of Faith; but these were eventually overcome, and he took up his duties as professor in November 1841. In the following year he married. From the first his professorial lectures were conspicuous for the unconventional enthusiasm with which he endeavoured to revivify the study of the classics; and his growing reputation, added to the attention excited by a translation of Aeschylus which he published in 1850, led to his appointment in 1852 to the professorship of Greek at Edinburgh University, in succession to George Dunbar, a post which he continued to hold for thirty years.\n\nHe was somewhat erratic in his methods, but his lectures were a triumph of influential personality. A journey to Greece in 1853 prompted his essay \"On the Living Language of the Greeks\", a favorite theme of his, especially in his later years; he adopted for himself a modern Greek pronunciation, and before his death he endowed a travelling scholarship to enable students to learn Greek at Athens.\n\nScottish nationality was another source of enthusiasm with him; and in this connection he displayed real sympathy with highland home life and the grievances of the crofters. The foundation of the Celtic chair at Edinburgh University was mainly due to his efforts. In spite of the many calls upon his time he produced a considerable amount of literary work, usually on classical or Scottish subjects, including some poems and songs of no mean order.\n\nBlackie was a Radical and Scottish nationalist in politics, of a fearlessly independent type; possessed of great conversational powers and general versatility, his picturesque eccentricity made him one of the characters of the Edinburgh of the day, and a well-known figure as be went about in his plaid, worn shepherd-wise, over one shoulder and under the other, wearing a broad-brimmed hat, and carrying a big stick.\n\nIn the 1880s and 1890s, he lectured at Oxford on the pronunciation of Greek, and corresponded on the subject with William Hardie. In May 1893, he gave his last lecture at Oxford, but afterwards admitted defeat, stating: \"It is utterly in vain here to talk reasonably in the matter of Latin or Greek pronunciation: they are case-hardened in ignorance, prejudice and pedantry\".\n\nHe died at 9 Douglas Crescent in Edinburgh. He is buried in Dean Cemetery to the north side of the central path in the north section of the original cemetery. His nephew and biographer, Archibald Stodart Walker (1869-1934) is buried with him.\n\nIn 1895 a plaque, designed by Robert Lorimer was erected to his memory in St Giles Cathedral.\n\nAll printed by David Douglas.\n\n\nBlackie married Elizabeth (known as Eliza) Wyld in 1842. They had no children. She is buried with him.\n\nHe was the uncle of Sir Alexander Kennedy.\n\nThe hymn he wrote on his honeymoon, \"Angels holy, high and lowly,\" has been called his most enduring work.\n\nAmongst his political writings, may be mentioned:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He has an MA in history from Leiden University and an MA in Mediterranean culture from the Amsterdam Free University, taught history at the Free University, and worked as an archivist employed by the Dutch government, before becoming one of the founders of the history school Livius Onderwijs.\n\nLendering's biography of Alexander the Great (\"Alexander de Grote\") attempted to make greater use than earlier scholars of Persian and Babylonian sources. For example, he argued from Babylonian astronomical diaries that Darius III of Persia was deserted by his troops when he faced Alexander at the Battle of Gaugamela, rather than personally leading the retreat as reported by Greek sources. His work, \"Alexander de Grote. De ondergang van het Perzische rijk\" was described by \"Bryn Mawr Classical Review\" contributor Jan P. Stronk from the University of Amsterdam, as \"clear and compelling\" and \"manifestly written for the general public\"-and although not sharing Lendering's love for psychological profiles, Lendering's work may be regarded as an incentive for serious scholars looking to expand their knowledge of new sources of ancient history.\n\nIn a passage cited by one commentator as characteristic of recent unsympathetic interpretations of Alexander, Lendering argued that Alexander's respectful treatment of Darius' family was not just an act of chivalry but also a claim to be the \"new king\". \"Quality Non-Fiction from Holland\" called \"Alexander de Grote\" \"fascinating\" and highlighted Lendering's attention to non-Western evidence. However, ancient historian Jan P. Stronk thought it clear from Lendering's book that these sources could at best illuminate specific details of Alexander's life.\n\nLendering's interest in using western sources in combination with eastern sources can also be discerned in his book on ancient Rome (\"Stad in marmer\"), in which he quoted hitherto neglected Talmudic sources, and especially in his book on the legacy of Babylon and the world of Islam to Medieval Europe, \"Vergeten erfenis\".\n\nIn the \"Bryn Mawr Classical Review\", Lendering's review of Kaveh Farrokh \"Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War\" was criticized as being \"marred by a series of overt inaccuracies, misconceptions and mistakes with respect to the domain of ancient Iranian studies.\" Lendering was also described by the authors of the response as displaying \"a consistent pattern of ignoring seminal works, journal publications, and research that contradict his points of view.\"\n\nIn 2010, Lendering and Arjen Bosman published \"De rand van het Rijk: de Romeinen en de Lage Landen.\"\n\nSince 1996, Lendering has maintained \"Livius\", a website containing numerous articles on ancient history. The site is divided into sections on specific regions – Anatolia, Persia, Greece, etc. – and an individual selection of topics is treated for each of these. The Mesopotamian section contains the recently discovered \"Babylonian Chronicles of the Hellenistic Period\".\n\nLivius Onderwijs is an association of teachers interested in ancient Mediterranean societies. (\"Onderwijs\" is Dutch for \"education\".) The association is based in Amsterdam and among other services offers a series of lectures there and elsewhere. It was founded in 2005 by Lendering and Marco Prins.\n\nAfter the publication of Lendering's \"Spijkers op laag water\", a book highly critical about the shortcomings of modern classicists, archaeologists, and historians, the research school of Dutch classicists and historians awarded him their annual \"Oikos publieksprijs\", recognizing Lendering's contributions to explaining Antiquity to a larger audience.\n\nIn 2011, he received the NKV award for his book \"De rand van het rijk\" (later translated into English and published as \"Edge of Empire\").\n\n\nLendering is a regular contributor to \"Ancient Warfare\"; his books have been translated into Turkish.\n\n"}

Controversy also exists regarding its translation.\n\nThe tablet (now considered to be a copy of an older Babylonian source) was discovered alongside the seven creation tablets of the \"Enûma Eliš\" in the ruined Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh and was by George Smith (1876) originally considered to have been a fragment of the \"Tablet VI\" detailing the Babylonian creation myth, specifically the creation of man by Marduk (or Merodach, Mirku) and his instructions to mankind. The Assyriologist Friedrich Delitzsch (1896) also considered the tablet to be a fragment of the \"Enûma Eliš\". The archaeologist Leonard William King however discovered in 1902 that the tablet was not a fragment of the \"Enûma Eliš\", but a separate tablet source listing a brief creation story, but mostly moral precepts assigned to the Babylonian God Marduk. The tablet was later donated to the British Museum, from which the tablet derived its name.\n\nA replica tablet of K. 3364 but belonging to the Neo-Babylonian period was also discovered in the late 19th century and also belongs to the British Museum (No. 33851).\n\nThe first translation of the tablet (both reverse and obverse) appeared in George Smith's \"Chaldean Account of Genesis\" (1876). Smith erroneously assumed that the tablet list of moral laws or instructions were meant for the \"newly created pair (man and woman) instructing them in their duties\". Theophilus Pinches and Leonard William King however corrected Smith's misinterpretation, since the instructions or moral laws on the tablet are in fact assigned to Marduk, but the tablet does briefly describe the creation of man.\n\nControversy arose specifically over line 18 on the obverse of the tablet since (in Smith's translation) it refers to the creation of a \"dark race\" (\"zalmat-qaqadi\") by Marduk:\n\nVarious different theories have been proposed about the meaning of the \"dark race\" (line 18) since Smith's translation:\n\nGerald Massey argued the \"dark race\" (\"zalmat-qaqadi\") of K.3364 is purely symbolic and not ethnological.\n\nGeorge Smith proposed that the \"dark race\" (\"zalmat-qaqadi\") were the original inhabitants of Babylon (and the surrounding area of Mesopotamia) connecting them to the same race as the \"Adamites\", or descendants of (Biblical) Adam, writing: \"in various other fragments of these legends they are called Admi or Adami, which is exactly the name given to the first man in Genesis\". The \"dark race\" connection to Adam was further popularised by Archibald Sayce who noted that the Akkadian word \"Adamatu\", meaning \"dark red\" (earth), appears closely connected to the etymology of Adam and that it relates to dark red skin. Adam in Hebrew translates as \"ruddy\" according to Gesenius, \"red, of the colour of blood\" according to Calmet, or \"ruddiness of flesh\" (\"ruddy\") according to James Strong. The root of the word Adam is \"dam\", meaning blood and some scholars have shown the parallels between this and the creation of man as described in the \"Enûma Eliš\" (Tablet VI). In Hebrew also, \"adom\" translates as \"ruddy\" or \"red\", while \"adamah\" as \"red soil\". Furthermore, according to Josephus (c. 94 AD): \"This man was called Adam, which in the Hebrew tongue signifies one that is red, because he was formed out of the red earth\".\n\nSayce, acknowledging the aforementioned links believed that the \"dark race\" described in K. 3364 (line 18) was a dark reddish skinned aboriginal race of \"primitive Babylonia\" that were invaded by a white skinned Semitic race. According to Sayce, the original \"dark race\" were Sumerians of the Turanid race, who \"belonged to the dark-skinned division, though it is not necessary to suppose them to have been black as the Negro\". Henry Rawlinson supported Sayce's views and further asserted that the ancient Babylonians knew of two principle races, as found in their inscriptions: \"the \"Adamu\", or dark race and the \"Sarku\", or light race\". The Sarku (or Sarcu) Sayce and Rawlinson maintained were the Semitic colonists who were white skinned. Rawlinson believed that both the aboriginal \"dark race\" and light skinned Semitic colonists are found preserved in Genesis. 6:1–7 as the \"sons of God\" and the \"daughters of man\". Sayce concluded by asserting that the Sarku modified Adam to denote their own \"white Semitic population\" after the dark red skinned Sumerian aborigines were conquered. Rawlinson equated the original \"dark race\" of Babylon to a \"dark Caucasoid race\", which in terms of later definition became defined as the Ethiopid race (Cushites).\n\nAlexander Winchell, a Professor of Paleontology and history author discussed the racial identity of the \"dark race\" of K.3364 in his work \"Pre-adamites\" (1880) from which he maintained the \"dark race\" were sunburnt Hamites of the Mediterranean race. Similar conclusions were also drawn by Herbert Spencer in his \"The Principles of Sociology\" (1885).\n\nSome scholars have argued that the \"dark race\" (\"zalmat-qaqadi\") in line 18 of K.3364 refers to the \"black-headed\" Sumerians, as their name suggests they derived it from the fact they were black haired. An array of earlier prominent Assyriologists have supported this position, noting that the aborigines of ancient Mesopotamia would only have employed such a name for themselves if they had encountered another people who possessed a different physiognomy, specifically fairer (blonde) hair: \"this implies that there was also a blond race in the country from which their black hair and eyes distinguished them\". Laurence Waddell was also a notable proponent of this theory, but maintained that the Sumerian royal dynasty was blonde (Aryan) while the lower masses (or 'subject' people) dark black haired primitives. The \"dark race\" (\"zalmat-qaqadi\") has then been suggested to only refer to the black hair of the Sumerian aborigines of Mesopotamia (Fertile Crescent) and not their skin complexion. Although some argue the \"dark race\" refers to both a dark skinned and black haired population.\n\n\"Sumerian was replaced by Akkadian in Mesopotamia. Akkadian is a Semitic language related to the tribal tongues of the desert nomads from Syria to Palestine. Semitic people and languages are typically associated with haplogroups E1b1b, T, J1 and J2. Akkadian being from northern Mesopotamia, where J2 is prevalent, early Akkadian speakers were likely to belong overwhelmingly to this haplogroup. However, it is likely that the deeper origins of all Afroasiatic languages (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Asiatic_languages) start exclusively with haplogroup E.\"\n\nhttp://www.eupedia.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-25439.html\n\nAfrocentrics argue that the \"dark race\" (\"zalmat-qaqadi\") refers to a Black African (Negroid) race,\nalthough anthropological and DNA studies undertaken on Sumerian remains do not support this assertion, nor do linguistics connect the Sumerians to any known Negroid language.\n\n“The proto-Afro-Asiatic group carrying the E-P2 mutation may have appeared at this point in time and subsequently gave rise to the different major population groups including current speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages and pastoralist populations.”\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4231410/\n"}

{"id": "40234652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40234652", "title": "Low Moor Ironworks", "text": "Low Moor Ironworks\n\nThe Low Moor Ironworks was a wrought iron foundry established in 1791 in the village of Low Moor about south of Bradford in Yorkshire, England. The works were built to exploit the high-quality iron ore and low-sulphur coal found in the area. Low Moor made wrought iron products from 1801 until 1957 for export around the world. At one time it was the largest ironworks in Yorkshire, a major complex of mines, piles of coal and ore, kilns, blast furnaces, forges and slag heaps connected by railway lines. The surrounding countryside was littered with waste, and smoke from the furnaces and machinery blackened the sky. Today Low Moor is still industrial, but the pollution has been mostly eliminated.\n\nThe ironworks depended on the excellent resources of high-quality coal and iron ore found in the vicinity.\nThe \"better bed\" coal came from a seam about thick resting on hard sandstone.\nThis coal is particularly low in sulphur.\nAbout above this coal seam there is a layer of \"black bed\" coal. The ironstone lies above this layer, holding about 32% iron.\nThe Halifax coal beds lie about below the better bed.\nAt the time the ironworks were developed recent technological advances had made it practical to smelt iron using coal rather than charcoal \nand to use steam engines to power the steps in production of iron goods.\n\nMost of the land occupied by the iron works was part of the Royds Hall estate. Operation of a coal mine on the estate is mentioned in 1673. \nIn 1744 the owner, Edward Rookes Leeds, began to actively develop the coal mines.\nAbout 1780 a wooden railway was built from the Low Moor mines to the coal yard in the centre of Bradford, from where the coal could be carried via the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Soon after, Leeds went bankrupt.\nThe property was twice offered for sale by auction, in December 1786 and October 1787, but no suitable offer was made.\nLeeds committed suicide in 1787.\n\nIn 1788 the estate was sold to a partnership of Richard Hird, a country gentleman, John Preston and John Jarratt for ₤34,000. \nAfter some sales of shares the partners were Richard Hird, Joseph Dawson, \na minister, and John Hardy, a solicitor. Dawson was interested in metallurgy and chemistry and was a close friend of Dr. Joseph Priestley. \nHe seems to have been the prime mover in the enterprise. \nThe partners planned to found an ironworks, and engaged an engineer from Wigan named Smalley to build the blast engine.\nSmalley called on Thomas Woodcock to prepare plans for the furnaces, casting houses and other works.\nWoodcock moved to Low Moor, and was to be architect and general manager until his death in 1833.\n\nConstruction of the plant began in June 1790, including blast furnaces and casting shops.\nThe furnaces had square bases, tapering as they rose to about in height. \nThe two furnaces were blown in on 13 August 1791 and the first casting was made by the forgemen three days later.\nAt first the works produced domestic goods, but soon began producing industrial products including parts for steam engines.\nIn 1795 the company won contracts to provide guns, shot and shells to the government, which had been at war with revolutionary France since 1793. By 1799 the works were producing about 2,000 tons of pig iron per year, from which iron goods were made that ranged from columns used in mill construction to garden furniture.\n\nThe ironworks were owned by the families of the founders throughout the 19th century, with the addition of the Wickhams, who married into the Hirds.\nThe annually employed capital grew from ₤52,000 in 1793 to ₤250,000 in 1818.\nThe company started to produce wrought iron in 1801, at first using imported iron but by 1803 using Low Moor pig iron.\nIn 1803 a regiment of volunteers was formed at Low Moor ready to repel the expected French invasion.\nThe works were gradually mechanised. \nBy 1805 there was a self-tipping inclined railway to charge the furnaces, a nail slitting mill, two nose-helve hammers and a plate-rolling mill.\nAs the iron works grew, the company built workers' cottages in the district that took the name of North Brierley and a hostel for the boys who worked in the pits.\nThe boys were given free clothing and schooling. The company also ran several public houses.\n\nBy the end of the war with France in 1814 the works were producing 33 tons of pig iron weekly.\nPrices fell for a while as demand slackened after the war, but demand for gas pipes and street lights began to pick up in 1822.\nThe Airedale poet John Nicholson wrote in 1829,\n\nBy 1835 the works were handling a growing volume of orders. There was no room to expand in the original site, which was crowded by industrial works, offices and workers houses. Construction started on a new site to the southeast, and in 1836 two oven-topped blast furnaces came into operation there.\nIn 1842 the company installed a new mill to roll iron plate for engine boilers. In 1843 four pairs of forge hammers were installed, driven by steam engines, and in 1844 the company decided to install one of James Nasmyth's newly invented steam hammers.\n\nThe process to convert ore into pig iron and then into wrought iron involved first converting the coal to coke to remove water and sulphur, a process that took 48 hours if done in piles in the yard, or 24 hours if done in ovens. \nAbout 32% of the better bed coal would be lost in coking.\nThe ironstone was allowed to weather for some time to free it from shale. Limestone was brought from Skipton to help separate clay from the iron ore.\nIn 1832 it took of coal, of limestone and of ironstone to make of pig iron.\n\nThe ironstone was baked with coke and limestone in a kiln, then emptied into a furnace, from which it came out as ore. \nThis was cast into pigs with crystalline or granular structure, and then refined by cold blast, coming out flaky. There were four blast furnaces, with the air delivered by powerful steam engines.\nThe iron was then puddled, becoming granular and malleable. The steam hammers forged the glowing iron into malleable slabs, which were rolled into wrought iron plates.\nLarge quantities of slag from the blast furnaces were sold for use in road-making.\n\nRobert Wilson, Works Manager at James Nasmyth's Bridgewater foundry in Patricroft near Manchester, had improved Nasmyth's 1842 design for a steam hammer, inventing the self-acting motion that made it possible to adjust the force of the blow delivered by the hammer – a critically important improvement.\nNasmyth's steam hammers could now vary the force of the blow across a wide range.\nNasmyth's first steam hammer was built for the Low Moor Works. \nThey rejected the machine, but on 18 August 1843 accepted an improved version with a self-acting gear.\nFrom 1845 to 1856 Robert Wilson was employed by the Low Moor Ironworks.\nWhile at Low Moor he improved the steam hammer with the \"circular balanced valve\".\nIn the Great Exhibition of 1851 at the Crystal Palace in London the ironworks exhibited an enormous cannon.\nThe company also provided samples of ore, coal, pig iron and wrought iron, a smaller gun, a sugar cane mill, an olive mill and an elliptograph.\n\nThe Low Moor company bought the Bierley Ironworks in 1854.\nBy 1855 Low Moor was producing 21,840 tons of iron per year, and was the largest ironworks in Yorkshire.\nThe foundries at Low Moor produced quantities of guns, shells and shot for troops fighting in the Crimean War (1853–56) and the Indian Mutiny (1857–58).\nThe arms business declined after this, as the government increasingly took charge of weapons production. The works turned to making weldless railway tyres, steam engine boilers, sugar pans for refineries in the West Indies, water pipes and heavy iron components for industrial purposes.\n\nBy 1863 there were 3,600 employees at the works including 1,993 miners, 420 furnacemen, 770 forgemen and 323 engineers.\nIn 1864 a second steam hammer with an 8-ton ram was installed for heavy forgings. In 1871 a third steam hammer of 7 tons was installed. \nNew rolling mills were also built to meet demand for iron plates in shipbuilding, supplied by slabs forged in the works. \nBy 1867 there were about 4,000 employees. A description of the works at that time said \nIn 1868 617,628 tons of Low Moor ironstone were raised, the peak production.\nIn 1876 about 2,000 coal miners were employed in pits ranging in depth from in the surrounding townships of North Bierley, Tong, Bowling, Shelf, Wyke, Clifton, Hipperholme and Cleckheaton.\nThirteen pumping engines were used to drain water from the mines. \nThe company also employed about 800 miners in collieries to the east at Beeston, Churwell, Osmondthorpe and Potternewton, near Leeds.\nMinerals were carried to the works by horse-drawn wagons or by wagons on tramways drawn by stationary engines.\n\nThe Low Moor mines produced about 60,000 tons of ore yearly by 1876. The iron was prized for its uniform and brilliant grain, commanding premium prices.\nThe quality seemed to be due in part to the nature of the ore and coal and in part to the manufacturing process.\nProduction came at the cost of aesthetics. An 1876 description said \"the natural effect of the perpetual smoke-canopy under which the vegetation of the district exists is to give to it a dinginess not pleasant to look upon... The appearance created by the works themselves and their surroundings has been not inaptly likened to that in the vicinity of the crater of some volcano.\"\n\nThe company began to run into difficulty in the late 1880s. Its mines were increasingly scattered and expensive. The rail network had a variety of gauges and used a mix of stationary engines and locomotives. Some of the plant was obsolete and operations were generally inefficient.\nHowever, there was continued demand for \"Best Yorkshire Iron\" for applications where safety was critically important.\nIn 1888 Low Moor was converted to a limited liability company, although descendants of the founders retained control.\nThe directors planned two new blast furnaces at the New Works, each high, with capacities of 340 and 240 tons per week.\nThe first came into operation in 1892. In 1905 an electrical power station was built at the New Works, with boilers fired by gas from the blast furnaces. Apart from the heaviest machines, steam drives were replaced by electrical drives. \nThe outbreak of World War I (1914–1918) caused a temporary surge in demand for shell casings and drop forgings, including shoes for the tracks of the first tanks.\n\nAfter the war it was clear that future demand for wrought iron was uncertain. The company was taken over by Robert Heath & Sons of Staffordshire, creating a new company called Robert Heath And Low Moor Ltd. Efforts were made to reduce costs, although this affected quality. \nAttempts to use high-sulphur coal created serious problems and destroyed the reputation of the works as a supplier of high quality iron, while a slump in heavy industry in the 1920s further reduced demand. The company poured money into attempts to diversify the operations, but did not succeed. In 1928 the company was declared bankrupt, and the Low Moor assets bought by Thos. W. Ward Ltd. Many of the mines, tracks and plant were closed or dismantled. \nSome buildings were sold or leased to other companies, and some plant was modernised. Wrought iron production finally ended in 1957. \nAs of 1971 new owners were producing alloy steel, making about 350 tons per week.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}

Officially, it was entitled the \"Law for the defence of the political and social order\" () but was nicknamed \"Maulkuerfgesetz\" by its opponents. The law would have allowed the Luxembourgish government to ban the Communist Party and dissolve any political organisation which they believed might endanger the constitutional institutions. The members of these parties or organisations would be stripped of their political offices and could not be employed by the state or by local governments.\n\nThe law was rejected in a referendum on 6 June 1937, and therefore never came into force.\n\nThe origins of the \"Law for the defence of the political and social order\", also named the \"Loi Bech\" after the prime minister Joseph Bech, go back to the year 1934. The government, a coalition of the Right Party and the Radical Liberal Party, put the proposed law to the Chamber of Deputies on 2 May 1935. Little happened from then to December 1936.\n\nThe parties supporting the Bech Ministry, the Right Party and the Liberals, were in favour of the law, the opposition (consisting of the Socialists and other left-wing parties) were not. It took almost 3 years until the law's text was clarified. To understand how a party that received just 9% of the vote in the Chamber elections (many of them protest votes) was seen as such a threat that it had to be banned, one must look at the political context of the time. Especially for the Christian-conservatives, communism was the embodiment of all evil; the Liberals, as representatives of industry and the world of business, were not much more well-disposed. Additionally, the prime minister Joseph Bech had never been a friend of universal suffrage, introduced in 1919, and was nostalgic for census suffrage for the rest of his life.\n\nThe debate in the Chamber started on 16 April 1937, and lasted 4 days. On 23 April the law was adopted by a majority (34 votes for, 19 against, 1 abstention).\n\nAfter the vote, however, opposition in the country increased rather than fading away, and therefore the Bech government decided to put the matter to a referendum. It was convinced that, with the support of the \"Luxemburger Wort\" and the Catholic Church, they would receive the population's assent. To many people's surprise, a slim majority (50,67 %) rejected the law on 6 June 1937.\n\nJoseph Bech then offered his government's resignation to the Grand Duchess. The latter did not accept it immediately, and so it took until 5 November 1937 for the new Dupong-Krier Ministry to be sworn in, with Joseph Bech as Foreign Minister, Minister for Wine-growing, and Arts and Sciences.\n\n"}

He was raised in American Fork, Utah until the age of 13 when his father went to Grant's Pass, Oregon to take part in the building of a new sugar beet-processing factory for the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. As Eli helped build the factory, he sent letters and money home, finally persuading his family to join him.\n\nThe family did not stay in Oregon long. Utah-Idaho failed to persuade local farmers to pick up the new crop and, two summers later, Eli was put in charge of dismantling the factory and loading it upon rail cars for reassembly in Yakima Valley, Washington. The family, which had always been poor, grew more impoverished with each move, and the Yakima venture did not pull them out.\n\nThe factory was not reassembled in time for the first year's (bumper) crop, and before the second year's crop could be processed, World War I ended, dropping sugar prices to what Bailey would later describe as \"catastrophic lows\". The lowered prices were accompanied by a disease called \"curly top\" which reduced the previously enormous Washington yields to industry-killing scarcity.\n\nThe Bailey family responded to the death of sugar with a disastrous attempt at potato farming in Washington, after which young Bailey ran away, back home to American Fork, where he set up residence with his maternal grandfather Joseph Barlow Forbes and his first wife—Bailey's grandmother—Nancy. Living with them meant Bailey was not allowed to drop out of school and work as he had intended.\n\nA year after his return to American Fork, his mother and his siblings also returned. Elie moved to Idaho Falls, Idaho to be foreman at a UISC factory there. Although Eli sent checks to his family, Bailey finally did drop out of school to help support his mother, who would soon divorce Eli, at which point Bailey left home for good with a move to Salt Lake City.\n\nSupporting himself with odd jobs, Bailey put himself through Henager's Business College and LDS Business College. While working at the county hospital as a night orderly, Bailey met Evelyn Robison. Shortly after impulsively kissing her and getting slapped in return, he moved to California and she returned to her hometown due to illness.\n\nShortly after arriving in Los Angeles, Bailey began work as an apprentice typographer. While working in newspapers, he remet Robison, who was working again at becoming a registered nurse. They were soon married, which resulted in her expulsion from General Hospital's School of Nursing. It was the eve of the Great Depression.\n\nEvelyn undertook secretarial training at Metropolitan College. Bailey's typographic work kept him busy and well employed throughout the Depression. However, he had developed a desire to write. He fed that need initially with fact-based, usually historical articles, including a serialized study of Samuel Brannan, published in the LDS periodicals \"Era\" and \"Millennial Star\", and, later, with much success, in book form. This began a string of successes with Church-owned publications, such as his novel \"For This My Glory\"; about the Mormon Battalion. His books were popular in Utah and even used as Sunday School texts.\n\nMeanwhile, he had taken reporting jobs at the \"Los Angeles Record\" and \"Hollywood Citizen\", followed by a sudden opportunity to purchase the \"Eagle Rock Advertiser\", one of two newspapers in Eagle Rock, a small town outside of Los Angeles. The paper was on the verge of collapse, but since he had both editorial and typographical preparation, Bailey was able to keep costs down and eventually turn the \"Advertiser\" into Eagle Rock's premier paper. Evelyn, for her part, drummed up additional advertising revenue.\n\nWorld War II brought on serious paper-rationing with smaller newspapers were powerless to work around. While larger LA-area papers were able to purchase Canadian pulp mills to keep in paper, smaller papers were forced to print fewer pages less frequently. The Baileys were particularly frustrated because during those boom years, the advertising available was much more than they had paper to print upon.\n\nTo supplement income, Bailey took a job reorganizing and running the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's \"Lockheed Star\", printing five separate editions for the five separate factories in the Burbank area.\n\nAlso during the war years, Bailey started Westernlore Press to reprint classic texts on the Western United States, whose rarity prevented most interested libraries from purchasing copies. To his surprise, this venture was eased by the War Production Board's far less stringent requirements for acquiring book paper. The books published by Westernlore—on the same presses used by the \"Advertiser\"—were immediate successes and every edition sold out.\n\nDuring this time, Bailey also found time to write three new books. The first, a fictionalized version of his Samuel Brannan biography, and the second (also a novel) were \"enthusiastically received by the Saints.\" The third, \"Jacob Hamblin, Buckskin Apostle\", became a source of controversy. Bailey received angry responses from LDS leadership and the Hamblin family—in large part because his book dealt with Hamblin's marriages to two Indian women and two white women, and the Mountain Meadows massacre. In later years however, \"Buckskin Apostle\" would experience a renaissance in LDS circles—even being published by Church-owned publication.\n\nThe end of the war saw larger corporations buying up impoverished smaller papers and forcing the others out of business. The \"Advertiser\" was one of the few, hardy small papers that survived the war rationing, only to be forced out of business by larger corporation shortly thereafter.\n\nBailey ran Westernlore until 1973, when its inventory was lost in a fire and his son Lynn moved the company to Tucson, Arizona. During the years he ran it, Westernlore continued to publish books focused on the Western United States that were highly regarded by libraries and well purchased. Westernlore published some of Bailey's own work, but his better known books were published by larger companies.\n\nMany of his later books proved, to his and his publishers' surprise, to be controversial. For instance, \"For Time and All Eternity\"—a book about the anti-polygamy crusade in the 1890s—caused a small uproar among the Utah faithful (although, according to Samuel W. Taylor, \"Bailey . . . [said the uproar] resulted from the objections of one man to a single passage in the book\"), as did his book on Zion's Camp, the Missouri Contingent, the Nauvoo Legion and the Mormon Battalion— \"The Armies of God.\" Bailey believed the book was \"a warm, honest appraisal of Mormon heroism in conquering the West\" and his publisher had arranged for numerous interviews and signings in Utah; however, in the end the book was never so much as reviewed in the State.\n\nAlthough estranged in many ways from Mormonism, Bailey always embraced that part of his heritage.\n\nEvelyn died in 1981. Bailey never remarried; he died in 1987. They were buried in Fillmore, Utah.\n\nMany of his papers are held by the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\n"}

He was also claimed to be from the neighboring County of Flanders. Phylidor reportedly spoke French when he was in Berlin. He was thought to be German when he came to Paris in 1792.\n\nFrom 1785 to 1800 Phylidor traveled through Europe as a showman (see below for details). He also (at least occasionally) traded in \"physical instruments\" and taught some of his tricks to paying customers.\n\nBy the time Phylidor came to Berlin in 1789 he was married and had a servant. He probably was a rich man, at least in the early 1790s: wealthy enough to own a carriage and to bribe a high official, but he may have lost his fortune later on.\n\nIn handbills, newspaper advertisements and announcements Phylidor sometimes claimed the praise of the royalty of several European courts. In 1786 he claimed to have a privilege of the Menus-Plaisirs of the King of France. From Catherine the Great and her court members he reportedly received 1.000 rubels, a gold tobacco box and a brilliant ring as appreciation for his performance of physics experiments in January 1787. He claimed to have gotten praise of the Dresden court for his new show in 1789. At least once he claimed to be of nobility, when he was registered in Regensburg in 1792 as \"Herr Baron von Phylidor, Physicus von Wien\".\n\nAlthough perceived as a charlatan and a very mediocre magician by enlightened Berliners in 1789, in the eyes of others he gained the reputation of an extraordinary man with special powers. He reportedly helped a lady who came to him for advice about clothes that had been stolen from her house: Phylidor said he would make the thief very unhappy for the rest of his life, if the clothes were not returned the next day. On Phylidor's request she told this to all her servants and the next morning the clothes were back in place. Phylidor also made a barber believe that he had removed his head to shave himself, secretly using an imitation of his head made out of wax.\n\nFrom around December 1798 to 1800 Phylidor collaborated on his shows with a business partner who was also advertised to be a physicist.\n\nIn March 1799 Phylidor had a feud with Dutch glassblower J. Demmenie, who according to Phylidor had copied his show after Phylidor had used a tent of Demmenie's mother and had worked with his brother in law as an attendant. Phylidor took out an ad in two local newspapers to warn the public against this poor copy of his show. Demmenie replied in the newspapers by calling Phylidor an alien libeller and claiming that the used machinery had been known to physicists since a 100 years and shown by others in the region since six years.\n\nPhylidor was very likely the same person as Paul de Philipsthal who lived in the U.K. and first performed Phantasmagoria shows in October 1801. \n\nPhilipsthal was granted a British patent for his Phantasmagoria on January 27, 1802.\n\nPaul de Philipsthal and his wife Mary had a son called Albert Augustus and a daughter called Paulina Theresa, both baptized in St Luke's Church, Chelsea on 13th August 1819.\n\nPaul de Philipsthal died unexpectedly on 7 March 1829 in Leeds, after a short illness that started the evening before. He had been performing in Leeds for six weeks, but his shows weren't very well attended and he had arranged to perform in Wakefield a few days later. He reportedly left his widow and three children unprovided for, so an appeal was made in the local newspaper to collect funds that would enable the family to move to Hull and get Mrs. Philipsthal established at a school over there.\nA benefit exhibition for the widow and children of Philipsthal's \"Royal Mechanical & Optical Museum\" was shown in the Wakefield Theatre.\n\nMuch of Phylidor's early shows and stage persona was based on the works of famous magician Joseph Pinetti. Pinetti had performed magic shows and exhibited ingenious mechanical devices across Europe, including performances at the Menus-Plasirs for the King of France in 1783. Pinetti publicized his shows cleverly. He claimed to be a professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy and dressed in courtly attire. Phylidor usually presented himself as a physicist in his advertisements.\n\nPhylidor referenced Johann Georg Schröpfer and Cagliostro in several advertisements. In the early 1770s Johann Georg Schröpfer had performed Masonic necromantic rituals and experiments, raising ghosts that were probably created with many hidden techniques including magic lantern projections on smoke. Soon after Schröpfer's death there was a boom of publications either attacking or defending his supposed supernatural abilities, expanding Schrepfer's fame across Europe. Several publications included explanations of techniques he might have used to conjure apparitions, which inspired several people to try to recreate Schrepfer's séances. Cagliostro was thought to have performed similar séances.\n\nIn the beginning Phylidor's shows were presented as \"black art\" or \"natural magic\" and included conjuring tricks and automata. When these weren't received well in Berlin in 1789, he tried to make an impression with the evocation of ghosts. But Phylidor's first séance resulted in the accusation of being a fraud, he was ordered to stop his activities and was expelled from Berlin. A few months later he published a statement that he never had conjured up any spirits, but that he showed how people could be deceived by charlatans. He regarded his shows by no means as supernatural, but as an art which had already found praise at the Dresden court. He further developed his ghost-raising show, probably making use of the recently invented Argand lamp, into a show that could more easily be seen by large audiences.\n\nOver the years his performances were advertised to include \"black arts\" or \"natural magic\", pyrotechnics, physics experiments, hydraulics, hydrostatics magnetic-mechanical experiments, mechanical pieces of art (including life-size mechanical figures), optical illusions / optical art (including apparitions of ghosts and absent persons) and catoptrics.\n\nPhylidor's first known performances were advertised by \"Charles Phyllidoor, professor in de physique en Mathematique\" to take place at six in the evenings of 27, 29, and 31 December and 2 January 1786 at De Schuttershof in Middelburg. He promised different tricks for each evening and presented his show as \"Zwarte Konst\" (Black Art) in one of his newspaper advertisements.\n\nA few months later \"De heer Phylidoor, professor in de Physique en Mathemathique\" arrived in Groningen and advertised two \"Representations der Zwarte Konst\" to take place in the local Concert Zaal at six in the evenings of 22nd and 23rd March. \"Moved by the lively appreciation and polite manner of several distinguished gentlemen who engaged him\" he would be back on 28 and 30 March for other \"amusing experiments\", including a trick which involved shooting away a ring that would be returned by Phyllidoor's dove and made to be found inside an orange. Spectators were requested to bring oranges for this purpose. In April he proposed to perform two more wondrous experiments, the first consisting of fireworks of inflammable air in which several animals could be seen. On command of the audience he would make the flames change into 25 different colors. For the second presentation Phylidoor would render a person of the audience unable to move, for as long as pleased him. Subscription to the performances was one Ducat, which was perceived as rather expensive.\n\nArriving from Russia, Phylidor first performed in Berlin on 8th February. The flyer promised \"sehenswürdige Magische oder sogenannte Schwarzkunst nachahmende Kunststücke\" (great magic tricks that imitate the so-called \"black arts\"). It would, among other surprises, include the following highlights:\n\nWhen his \"Expériences physiques de St. Philidor\" or \"magical experiments\" of the following weeks were perceived as mediocre magic tricks and raised little applause, Phylidor decided to try something else.\n\nAfter twelve days of preparation Phylidor invited an audience of 14 men to an evocation of ghosts at 7:00 p.m. on the 30th of March . The 14 distinguished men did not expect to see real ghosts, but intended to amuse themselves by trying to find out how this magician wanted to fool the audience. They agreed to keep their heads clear to witness the evocation as attentively as possible. Royal Theater director Von der Reck was among the 14 men welcomed by Phylidor's wife and a little man that she called \"Professor\", before being led through small and dark staircases up to the third floor.\n\nPhylidor was dressed in black and led the visitors into a small darkened room with dazzling white walls, in which a rectangular area was fenced off with a construction of slats with a metal hand on each end. In the center of a chalk circle on the floor were a wand and a small lantern on a folded long black cloth. A container with almost burned out coals stood next to it. Phylidor asked the spectators not to speak, move or touch anything since they were surrounded by terrible dangers. He advised them to hold each other's hands and the ones on the end to hold the metal hands in order not to fall over and as a protection against the dangers. Von der Reck asked the man next to him to let go of his hand, because he did not want to get an electric shock. Phylidor then extinguished the lantern, leaving only the very weak light of the coals. Soon thick white odorous smoke started to spread across the room and Phylidor started the ritual. It included some incantations in a dull but commanding voice with the words \"Helion, Melion, Tetragrammaton\" (as reportedly used by Cagliostro), some French sentences like \"Parois. Esprit terrible! Esprit terrible, épargne moi!\" and the name of Jehovah mixed in repeatedly. A terrible thunder-like noise filled the room and as Phylidor called out: \"Esprit, parois!\" (Ghost, appear!), a streak of light appeared on the wall that gradually transformed into the (almost) life-size figure of Voltaire, dressed in white and hovering a foot above the floor. Some spectators complained that this was a very poor apparition and clearly a projection of some transparent picture. Phylidor commanded the spirit to disappear and soon an apparition of Frederick the Great followed. When some visitors complained that the facial features weren't very clear, Phylidor replied that he was surprised that they expected to see this on a ghost. Then Von der Eck confronted Phylidor with the question if it wasn't all just optical illusions. Phylidor threatened with terrible dangers that would be caused by this behavior. Von der Eck and other audience members then demanded to see Phylidor raise the devil, if he would still insist that he really had supernatural powers. He pleaded not to have to do this, but instead to raise the spirit of the deceased father of an Englishman in the audience as they had agreed a few days before. He conjured this apparition, but the image showed a figure in too fashionable an outfit for someone who had died a few years before. In the meantime the smoke had become too irritating and some men called for light and wanted the door to be opened. Phylidor proposed to make King Heinrich IV appear, but couldn't calm his audience and accepted his defeat. Some of the men warned him that it would not end well if he was to perform his deceitful tricks again.\n\nThe morning after Phylidor's failed séance, he was told by the police not to perform his magic again, because it went \"against religion and good manners\", and he was ordered to leave Berlin.\n\nAfter Phylidor had left, Von der Eck examined the room and found some evidence that the apparitions were created by rear projection on a transparent screen in the wall. He also found traces of a metal wire that had been attached to the walls, which he thought was intended to ignite some combustible materials to create the illusion of the complete room being on fire.\n\nPhylidor had further developed his show when he came to Vienna and claimed to have perfected his ghostly apparitions with a totally new invention. He advertised his show in March 1790 as \"Phantasmorasi, oder natürlicher Geister Erscheinungen\" (Phantasmorasi, or natural ghost apparitions), besides very entertaining magnetic-mechanical experiments in his renewed Cabinet of Physics. Spectators would first gather and wait silently in an anteroom, until the physicist ordered them to enter a black-curtained room decorated with skeletons, two candles and a white circle on the ground. The very solemn performance would start with the sound of thunder that would grow louder and louder, accompanied by hail and wind. Lights would extinguish themselves one by one and flames would rise from the lamps before being extinguished and rendering the room in total darkness. Then ghosts of all sizes and shapes would fly around in a circle. After a very fierce storm a summoned, lifelike ghost of a person known to the audience would eventually rise from the floor to slowly sink back into the abyss in the ground. Ghosts would appear in various ways; one would suddenly be there, another would slowly shape itself from a grey cloud and yet another would approach from far away and come so close that one could touch it. Some apparitions would take a few steps closer to the audience before disappearing. Spectators were spared any annoyance of foul tastes or odors and could count on a pleasant experience. The show would start at seven in the evening and last one and a half hour. There would be three public performances a week and private shows for parties up to 24 people could be booked for the remaining days. One review stated that no optical or other tricks could be discerned. However, this \"review\" could have been part of Phylidor's newspaper promotions: it is somewhat similar to advertisements and handbills that also described the show.\n\nA \"Phantasmagorie\" by Paul Filidort in Paris was first advertised on 16 December 1792. It was several years into the French Revolution and the audience were particularly open to the idea of seeing their dead heroes. However, with tensions running high and Philidor's shows increasingly making political references it was not long until he found himself in trouble with the authorities. Philidor made references to well-known revolutionaries of the day, making Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton, and Jean-Paul Marat appear as if they were the devil. According to the memoirs of Madame Tussaud, a \"Monsieur Phillipstal\" was arrested after the audience of a phanstasmagoria show protested at what they interpreted as a depiction of the rise of Louis XVI to heaven, caused by a mistake by an assistant who was removing the slide during projection. Phillipsthal's wife would have bribed authorities so he was released from prison. However, this may be only legend as also Robertson is associated with trouble after showing a slide of Louis XVI, which Tussaud might have read in Robertson's \"Mémoirs\" (1831-1833) and mixed-up with Philipsthal.\n\nIn 1798 \"Phycisist\" Phylidor exhibited his \"Large Cabinet of Mechanical and Optical Arts\" including ghostly apparitions and life-size mechanical figures in several cities of the Batavian Republic (now a large part of the Netherlands). \nIn Rotterdam during the summer of 1799 Phylidor advertised his cabinet to have considerably increased since the year before and especially mentions his peacock automaton, which ate and drank as if it were real. The performance took place in a tent in the Gebakken Pauwesteeg (\"Baked Peacock Alley\"). Returning to Groningen in 1800 \"Physici Phylidor & Compn.\" advertised their totally new wondrous mechanical and optical pieces of art, by candlelight and accompanied by music.\n\nIn October 1801 M. Philipsthal set up an exhibition of \"Phantasmagoria\" at the Lyceum Theatre, London. It was a huge success and soon other showmen presented their versions of phantasmagoria. \n\nAfter a short break Philidor reopened his show with the wax museum of Marie Tussaud alongside. Tussaud had left France to join up with Philidor, who agreed to allow her to associate with his fame for half of her profits. She would go on to travel Great Britain and Ireland until settling down for a permanent exhibition on Baker Street in 1835.\n\nPhilipsthal would take his show to other large cities in Britain over the years.\n\nBetween May 1811 and April 1813 Philipsthal was joined by a mister Maillardet to exhibit the Royal Mechanical and Optical Museum in theatres in England. It consisted of their Musical Automatons, Mechanical Rope-Dancers, (as Large Life,) Singing Bird, and many other wonders.\n\nPhilipsthal gave his last shows with his Royal Mechanical and Optical Museum in February 1829 in Leeds, a few weeks before his death.\n\nPhylidor traveled across parts of Europe, mainly visiting the capitals and larger cities:\n\n"}

It is a formidable fort having been a focal point of the historical developments of Rajasthan. The fort was held by the Chahamanas (Chauhans) until the 13th century, when the Delhi Sultanate captured it.\n\nIn 2013, at the 37th session of the World Heritage Committee, Ranthambore Fort, along with 5 other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the group Hill Forts of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Ranthambore fort was built by a Nagill Jat rulers, after few years when Chouhan Ruler capture this fort they do some changes although the exact name of the ruler is disputed. A widely held belief states that the fort was built the reign of Sapaldaksha, in 944 CE. Another theory states that the fort was built during the reign of Jayant, in 1110 CE. According to Government of Rajasthan's Amber Development & Management Authority, it is likely that the construction started in the mid-10th century during the reign of Sapaldaksha, and continued a few centuries after that.\n\nIts earlier name was Ranastambha or Ranastambhapura. It was associated with Jainism during the reign of Prithviraja I of Chahamana (Chauhan) dynasty in the 12th century. Siddhasenasuri, who lived in the 12th century has included this place in the list of holy Jain tirthas. In Mughal period, a temple of Mallinatha was built in the fort.\n\nAfter the defeat of Prithviraja III (Prithviraj Chauhan) in 1192 CE, the fort came under the control of the Muslim Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghor. Prithviraja's son Govindaraja IV accepted the Ghurid suzerainty, and ruled Ranthambore as his vassal. His descendants made various attempts to become independent.\nThe Delhi Sultan Iltutmish captured Ranthambore in 1226, but the Chauhans recaptured it after his death in 1236. The armies of Sultan Nasir ud din Mahmud, led by the future Sultan Balban, unsuccessfully besieged the fortress in 1248 and 1253, but captured from Jaitrasingh Chauhan in 1259. Shakti Dev succeeded Jaitrasingh in 1283, and recaptured Ranthambore and enlarged the kingdom. Sultan Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji briefly besieged the fort in 1290-91. In 1299, Hammiradeva sheltered Muhammad Shah, a rebel general of Sultan Ala ud din Khalji, and refused to turn him over to the Sultan. The Sultan besieged and conquered the fort in 1301.\n\nThe fortress was captured by the kingdom of Mewar under Rana Hamir Singh (1326–1364) and Rana Kumbha (1433–1468).\n\nDuring Rana Udai Singh I's reign (1468–1473) the fortress passed to the Hada Rajputs of Bundi. Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat captured the fortress from 1532 to 1535. The Mughal Emperor Akbar captured the fortress in 1569.\n\nThe fortress passed to the Kachwaha Maharajas of Jaipur in the 17th century, and it remained part of Jaipur state until Indian Independence. The area surrounding the fortress became a hunting ground for the Maharajas of Jaipur. Jaipur state acceded to India in 1949, becoming part of the state of Rajasthan in 1950.\n\nInside Ranthambore fort there are three Hindu temples dedicated to Ganesh, Shiva and Ramlalaji constructed in 12th and 13th centuries from red Karauli stone.

Richard Baker's father, John Baker, was the second son of Sir John Baker, the first Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nRichard Baker had a younger brother named Thomas, who is doubtless the ancestor of William Baker of Lismacue House in County Tipperary, Ireland.\n\nBaker entered Hart Hall, Oxford, as a commoner in 1584. He left the university without graduating, but was granted the degree of Master of Arts by decree in 1594, studied law in London, and afterwards travelled in mainland Europe. In 1593 he was chosen Member of Parliament for Arundel, and in 1597 was elected to Parliament as the representative of East Grinstead as a nominee of Lord Buckhurst, his uncle.\n\nIn 1603 Baker was knighted by King James I at Theobalds Palace. At the time he was living in Highgate. He held the office of Justice of the Peace for Middlesex. In 1620 he was High Sheriff of Oxfordshire, where he inherited the manor of Middle Aston.\n\nBy making himself responsible for some debts of his wife's family he was reduced to great poverty, which led to the seizure of his Oxfordshire property in 1625. Penniless, he took refuge in the Fleet prison in 1635, and was still in confinement when he died 18 February 1645. He was buried in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.\n\nAbout 1600 Baker married Margaret Mainwaring (d.1654), daughter of Sir George Mainwaring of Ightfield, Shropshire, by whom he had three sons and four daughters:\n\nDuring his imprisonment Baker spent his time mainly in writing. His chief work is the \"Chronicle of the Kings of England from the Time of the Romans' Government unto the Death of King James\" (1643, and many subsequent editions). It was translated into Dutch in 1649, and was continued down to 1658 by Edward Phillips, a nephew of John Milton, who became a strong Royalist. For many years the \"Chronicle\" was extremely popular, but owing to numerous inaccuracies its historical value is very slight.\n\nOther writings:\n\nBaker also wrote \"Meditations upon several of the psalms of David,\" which have been collected and edited by Alexander Grosart (London, 1882).\n\n"}

Tahtawi was among the first Egyptian scholars to write about Western cultures in an attempt to bring about a reconciliation and an understanding between Islamic and Christian civilizations. He founded the School of Languages in 1835 and was influential in the development of science, law, literature and Egyptology in 19th-century Egypt. His work influenced that of many later scholars including Muhammad Abduh.\n\nTahtawi was born in 1801 in the village of Tahta, Sohag, the same year the French troops evacuated Egypt. He was an Azharite recommended by his teacher and mentor Hassan El-Attar to be the chaplain of a group of students Mohammed Ali was sending to Paris in 1826. Originally intended to be an Imam, or Islamic \"religious guide\", he was allowed to associate with the other members of the mission through persuasion of his authoritative figures. Many student missions from Egypt went to Europe in the early 19th century to study arts and sciences at European universities and acquire technical skills such as printing, shipbuilding and modern military techniques. According to his memoir \"Rihla\" (\"Journey to Paris\"), Tahtawi studied ethics, social and political philosophy, and mathematics and geometry. He read works by Condillac, Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu and Bézout among others during his séjour in France.\n\nIn 1831, Tahtawi returned home to be part of the statewide effort to modernize the Egyptian infrastructure and education. He undertook a career in writing and translation, and founded the School of Languages (also knowns as \"School of Translators\") in 1835, which become part of Ain Shams University in 1973. The School of Languages graduated the earliest modern Egyptian intellectual milieu, which formed the basis of the emerging grassroots mobilization against British colonialism in Egypt. Three of his published volumes were works of political and moral philosophy. They introduced his Egyptian audience to Enlightenment ideas such as secular authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or \"good Egyptian\"; and his ideas on public interest and public good. Tahtawi's work was the first effort in what became an Egyptian renaissance (\"nahda\") that flourished in the years between 1860–1940.\n\nHe died in Cairo in 1873.\n\nTahtawi is considered one of the early adapters to Islamic Modernism. Islamic Modernists attempted to integrate Islamic principles with European social theories. In 1826, Al-Tahtawi was sent to Paris by Mehmet Ali. Tahtawi studied at an educational mission for five years, returning in 1831. Tahtawi was appointed director of the School of Languages. At the school, he worked translating European books into Arabic. Tahtawi was instrumental in translating military manuals, geography, and European history. In total, al-Tahtawi supervised the translation of over 2,000 foreign works into Arabic. Al-Tahtawi even made favorable comments about French society in some of his books. Tahtawi stressed that the Principles of Islam are compatible with those of European Modernity.\n\nIn his piece, \"The Extraction of Gold or an Overview of Paris,\" Tahtawi discusses the patriotic responsibility of citizenship. Tahtawi uses Roman civilization as an example for what could become of Islamic civilizations. At one point all Romans are united under one Caesar but split into East and West. After splitting, the two nations see “all its wars ended in defeat, and it retreated from a perfect existence to nonexistence.” Tahtawi understands that if Egypt is unable to remain united, it could fall prey to outside invaders. Tahtawi stresses the importance of citizens defending the patriotic duty of their country. One way to protect one's country according to Tahtawi, is to accept the changes that come with a modern society.\n\nAl-Tahtawi, like others of what is often referred to as the 'Nahda' (Muslim Nahda), was spellbound and \"seduced\" by French (and Western in general) culture in his books. Shaden Tageldin has suggested that this produced an intellectual inferiority complex in his ideas that aided in an \"intellectual colonization\" that remains till today among Egyptian intelligentsia.\n\nA selection of his works are:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "512280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=512280", "title": "Robert Ripley", "text": "Robert Ripley\n\nLeRoy Robert Ripley (December 25, 1890 – May 27, 1949) was an American cartoonist, entrepreneur, and amateur anthropologist who is known for creating the \"Ripley's Believe It or Not!\" newspaper panel series, radio show, and television show which feature odd facts from around the world.\n\nSubjects covered in Ripley's cartoons and text ranged from sports feats to little-known facts about unusual and exotic sites. But what ensured the concept's popularity may have been that he also included items submitted by readers, who supplied photographs of a wide variety of small-town American trivia ranging from unusually shaped vegetables to oddly marked domestic animals, all documented by photographs and then depicted by his drawings.\n\nIn 1919 Ripley married Beatrice Roberts. He made his first trip around the world in 1922, delineating a travel journal in installments. This ushered in a new topic for his cartoons: unusual and exotic foreign locales and cultures. Because he took the veracity of his work quite seriously, in 1923 he hired a researcher and polyglot named Norbert Pearlroth as a full-time assistant. In 1926 Ripley's feature moved from the \"New York Globe\" to the \"New York Post\".\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Ripley continued to broaden the scope of his work and his popularity increased greatly. He published both a travel journal and a guide to the game of handball in 1925. In 1926, he became the New York State handball champion and also wrote a book on boxing. With a proven track record as a versatile writer and artist, he attracted the attention of publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst, who managed the King Features Syndicate. In 1929, Hearst was responsible for \"Believe It or Not!\" making its syndicated debut in seventeen papers worldwide. With the success of this series assured, Ripley capitalized on his fame by getting the first book collection of his newspaper panel series published.\n\nOn November 3, 1929, he drew a panel in his syndicated cartoon saying \"Believe It or Not, America has no national anthem.\" Despite the widespread belief that \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", with its lyrics by Francis Scott Key set to the music of the English drinking song \"To Anacreon in Heaven\", was the United States national anthem, Congress had never officially made it so. In 1931, John Philip Sousa published his opinion in favor of giving the song official status, stating that \"it is the spirit of the music that inspires\" as much as it is Key's \"soul-stirring\" words. By a law signed on March 3, 1931, by President Herbert Hoover, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" was adopted as the national anthem of the United States.\n\nIn the 1930s Ripley expanded his presence into other forms of media. In 1930, he began a fourteen-year run on radio and a nineteen-year association with the show's producer, Doug Storer. Funding for Ripley's celebrated travels around the world were provided by the Hearst organization, and he recorded live radio shows underwater and from the sky, the Carlsbad Caverns, the bottom of The Grand Canyon, snake pits, and foreign countries. The next year he hosted the first of a series of two dozen \"Believe It or Not!\" theatrical short films for Warner Bros. & Vitaphone, and King Features published a second collected volume of \"Believe it or Not!\" panels. He also appeared in a Vitaphone musical short, \"Seasons Greetings\" (1931), with Ruth Etting, Joe Penner, Ted Husing, Thelma White, Ray Collins, and others. After a trip to Asia in 1932, he opened his first museum, the Odditorium, in Chicago in 1933. The concept was a success, and at one point there were Odditoriums in San Diego, Dallas, Cleveland, San Francisco, and New York City. By this point in his life, Ripley had been voted the most popular man in America by \"The New York Times\", received an honorary degree from Dartmouth College, and visited 201 foreign countries.\n\nDuring World War II, Ripley concentrated on charity pursuits rather than world travel, but after the war, he re-expanded his media efforts. In 1948, the year of the 20th anniversary of the \"Believe it or Not!\" cartoon series, the \"Believe it or Not!\" radio show drew to a close and was replaced with a \"Believe it or Not!\" television series. This was a rather bold move on Ripley's part because of the small number of Americans with access to television at this early time in the medium's development. He completed only thirteen episodes of the series before he became incapacitated by severe health problems. He reportedly passed out during the filming of his final show.\n\nHis health worsened, and on May 27, 1949, at age 58, he succumbed to a heart attack in New York City. He was buried in his home town of Santa Rosa in the Oddfellows Lawn Cemetery, which is adjacent to the Santa Rosa Rural Cemetery.\n\nRipley's cartoon series was estimated to have 80 million readers worldwide, and it was said that he received more mail than the President of the United States. He became a wealthy man, with homes in New York and Florida, but he always retained close ties to his home town of Santa Rosa, California, and he made a point of bringing attention to The Church of One Tree, a church built entirely from the wood of a single 300-ft (91.4-m)-tall redwood tree, which stands on the north side of Juilliard Park in downtown Santa Rosa.\n\nRipley claimed to be able to \"prove every statement he made\" because he worked with professional fact researcher Norbert Pearlroth, who assembled \"Believe it or Not!\"'s array of odd facts and also verified the small-town claims submitted by readers. Pearlroth spent 52 years as the feature's researcher, finding and verifying unusual facts for Ripley and, after Ripley's death, for the King Features syndicate editors who took over management of the \"Believe it or Not!\" panel.\n\nAnother employee who edited the newspaper cartoon series over the years was Lester Byck. Others who drew the series after Ripley's death include Don Wimmer; Joe Campbell (1946-1956); Art Slogg; Clem Gretter (1941-1949); Carl Dorese; Bob Clarke (1943-1944); Stan Randall; Paul Frehm (1938–1975), who became the panel's full-time artist in 1949; and his brother Walter Frehm (1948–1989).\n\nRipley's ideas and legacy live on in Ripley Entertainment, a company bearing his name and owned since 1985 by the Jim Pattison Group, Canada's largest privately held company. Ripley Entertainment airs national television shows, features publications of oddities, and has holdings in a variety of public attractions, including Ripley's Aquarium, Ripley's Believe it or Not! Museums, Ripley's Haunted Adventure, Ripley's Mini-Golf and Arcade, Ripley's Moving Theater, Ripley's Sightseeing Trains, Guinness World Records Attractions, and Louis Tussaud's wax Museums.\n\n"}

Moss (born January 31, 1940) is an historian, educator, administrator and author in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Throughout a long career he has also been an aggressive and entrepreneurial advocate for the preservation and authentic restoration of historic buildings. For forty years Moss directed the Athenaeum of Philadelphia, a special collections library near Independence Hall, and for 25 of those years he also taught in the Graduate Program in Historic Preservation at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nRoger William Moss was born and raised in Zanesville, Ohio, the only child of Roger William and Dorothy Elizabeth Martin Moss. He received his B.S.Ed and M.A. degrees from Ohio University. During the summer of 1962 he was an assistant to the director of the Peace Corps staff preparing the first team destined for the Cameroon. While pursuing his Master of Arts degree he was curator of rare books at Ohio University Library which resulted in his first publications. In 1964 Moss accepted a teaching fellowship from The University of Delaware leading to his Ph.D. with a major in early American history and a minor in American Material Culture at Winterthur Museum. During the summer of 1966 he studied English country houses and collections as an Attingham Trust Fellow. and during the academic year 1967-68 he was an adjunct lecturer in history for the University of Delaware and the University of Maryland extension programs.\n\nIn 1968 Moss became the Executive Director of The Athenæum of Philadelphia, a member-supported library founded in 1814 and housed in a National Historic Landmark building near Independence Hall. During his four-decade tenure there he restored and expanded the building and reorganized the nearly moribund institution as an independent research library specializing in American architecture prior to 1930 and nineteenth-century material culture. Under his direction the research collections in architecture and Victorian-era design rapidly expanded, including the acquisition of the archives of numerous major American architects ranging from Thomas Ustick Walter (1804-1887) to Paul Philippe Cret (1876-1945). In 1969 Moss became a trustee of the Christopher Ludwick Foundation, one of Philadelphia's oldest philanthropic institutions founded in 1799 to advance the education of the poor children of Philadelphia. He would serve the foundation as an officer or trustee for forty-six years.\n\nWhen The Victorian Society in America was founded in 1966, Moss became an early board member and officer. He also capitalized on the explosion of popular interest in Victorian architecture and design in the 1970s and 1980s. One of his first steps was to invite the Victorian Society to establish its national office at the Athenæum which provided a base for the infant society and both national and international visibility for the Athenæum. Moss also proved to be an aggressive collector with remarkable fund raising ability, particularly for the acquisition, conservation, proper housing, and exhibition of architectural records, securing major grants from national, state, and local foundations for those purposes. He also doubled the membership and raised substantial sums to endow the building, staff positions, and programs. In 1976 Moss launched a publication series to reprint rare Victorian design sources from the Athenæum collection, beginning with \"Exterior Decoration: A Treatise on the Artistic Use of Colors in the Ornamentation of Buildings\" originally published in 1885 by the Devoe Paint Company www.1754Paint.com complete with large color plates and authentic paint samples. This reprint became a seminal influence in the nationwide movement to preserve, restore, and authentically repaint Victorian-era buildings. In 1973 Moss was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, London, England.\n\nMoss has been well known in historic preservation in the U.S. for several decades. He has taught at the University of Pennsylvania in the historic preservation program since 1981. His works at the Athenaeum of Philadelphia since 1968 include restoration of the institution's building, and amassing a significant collection of historic architectural drawings and photographs for its library. He has written numerous books and articles.\n\nOne of his most influential contributions to preservationists and architects working in the field may be his landmark books on historic American paints and colors. His investigations led to the creation of the first full line of historic paint colors produced by Sherwin-Williams Paints, the American paint manufacturer.\n\n\n"}

Shalimar was re-released in 1925 at the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts.\n\nJacques Guerlain was inspired by Mumtaz Mahal, the woman for whom the Taj Mahal in Agra and the Shalimar Gardens in Lahore were built. The harmony of Shalimar was created when Jacques Guerlain poured a bottle of ethylvanillin into a bottle of Jicky, a fragrance created by Guerlain in 1889.\n\nRaymond Guerlain designed the bottle for Shalimar, which was modeled after the basins of eastern gardens and Mongolian stupa art. Shalimar's blue, fan-shaped bottle topper was inspired by a piece of silverware owned by the Guerlain family.The bottle was manufactured by Baccarat Crystal and received the International Decorative Arts Exhibition Award in 1925.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Shalimar was popular with flappers which helped give it a \"bad girl\" reputation.\n\nIn 1985, Shalimar was repackaged and presented encased in a Lucite box to commemorate the 60th anniversary of its original launch. In 2004, Guerlain issued Shalimar Light by perfumer Mathilde Laurent. However, Shalimar Light was taken off the market and replaced by Eau de Shalimar in 2008.\n\nShalimar is preserved in its original 1925 formulation in the archives of the Osmothèque, donated by Jean-Paul Guerlain. As of 2017, Shalimar was Guerlain's second best selling fragrance, behind La Petite Robe Noire, with approximately 108 bottles being sold every hour.\n\nThe fragrance contains notes of bergamot, lemon, iris, jasmine, rose, patchouli, vetiver, opopanax, tonka bean, frankincense, sandalwood, musk, civet, ambergris, leather, and vanilla. It is considered to be an Oriental perfume (see Fragrance Wheel).\n\nIllustrator Lyse Darcy created many illustrated ads for Guerlain products, including Shalimar, from the 1930s through the 1950s. Photographs taken by Helmut Newton were used in a print campaign for Shalimar in 1997.\n\nIn 2013, Guerlain produced an advertisement titled \"The Legend of Shalimar,\" featuring Natalia Vodianova.

{"id": "81553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81553", "title": "Teotihuacan", "text": "Teotihuacan\n\nTeotihuacan , (in Spanish: Teotihuacán) (, ), is an ancient Mesoamerican city located in a sub-valley of the Valley of Mexico, located in the State of Mexico northeast of modern-day Mexico City, known today as the site of many of the most architecturally significant Mesoamerican pyramids built in the pre-Columbian Americas.\n\nAt its zenith, perhaps in the first half of the 1st millennium CE, Teotihuacan was the largest city in the pre-Columbian Americas, with a population estimated at 125,000 or more, making it at least the sixth largest city in the world during its epoch. Apart from the pyramids, Teotihuacan is also anthropologically significant for its complex, multi-family residential compounds, the Avenue of the Dead and its vibrant murals that have been well-preserved. Additionally, Teotihuacan exported fine obsidian tools that are found throughout Mesoamerica. The city is thought to have been established around 100 BCE, with major monuments continuously under construction until about 250 CE. The city may have lasted until sometime between the 7th and 8th centuries CE, but its major monuments were sacked and systematically burned around 550 CE.\n\nTeotihuacan began as a religious center in the Mexican Highlands around the first century CE. It became the largest and most populated center in the pre-Columbian Americas. Teotihuacan was home to multi-floor apartment compounds built to accommodate the large population. The term Teotihuacan (or Teotihuacano) is also used for the whole civilization and cultural complex associated with the site.\n\nAlthough it is a subject of debate whether Teotihuacan was the center of a state empire, its influence throughout Mesoamerica is well documented; evidence of Teotihuacano presence can be seen at numerous sites in Veracruz and the Maya region. The later Aztecs saw these magnificent ruins and claimed a common ancestry with the Teotihuacanos, modifying and adopting aspects of their culture. The ethnicity of the inhabitants of Teotihuacan is the subject of debate. Possible candidates are the Nahua, Otomi or Totonac ethnic groups. Scholars have suggested that Teotihuacan was a multi-ethnic state.\n\nThe city and the archaeological site are located in what is now the San Juan Teotihuacán municipality in the State of México, approximately northeast of Mexico City. The site covers a total surface area of and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. It is the most visited archaeological site in Mexico, receiving 4,185,017 visitors in 2017.\n\nThe name \"Teōtīhuacān\" was given by the Nahuatl-speaking Aztecs centuries after the fall of the city around 550 CE. The term has been glossed as \"birthplace of the gods\", or \"place where gods were born\", reflecting Nahua creation myths that were said to occur in Teotihuacan. Nahuatl scholar Thelma D. Sullivan interprets the name as \"place of those who have the road of the gods.\" This is because the Aztecs believed that the gods created the universe at that site. The name is pronounced in Nahuatl, with the accent on the syllable \"wa\". By normal Nahuatl orthographic conventions, a written accent would not appear in that position. Both this pronunciation and are used, and both spellings appear in this article.\n\nThe original name of the city is unknown, but it appears in hieroglyphic texts from the Maya region as \"puh\", or \"Place of Reeds\". This suggests that, in the Maya civilization of the Classic period, Teotihuacan was understood as a Place of Reeds similar to other Postclassic Central Mexican settlements that took the name of \"Tollan\", such as \"Tula-Hidalgo\" and \"Cholula\".\n\nThis naming convention led to much confusion in the early 20th century, as scholars debated whether Teotihuacan or Tula-Hidalgo was the Tollan described by 16th-century chronicles. It now seems clear that \"Tollan\" may be understood as a generic Nahua term applied to any large settlement. In the Mesoamerican concept of urbanism, \"Tollan\" and other language equivalents serve as a metaphor, linking the bundles of reeds and rushes that formed part of the lacustrine environment of the Valley of Mexico and the large gathering of people in a city.\n\nThe early history of Teotihuacan is quite mysterious and the origin of its founders is uncertain. Around 300 BCE, people of the central and southeastern area of Mesoamerica began to gather into larger settlements. Teotihuacan was the largest urban center of Mesoamerica before the Aztecs, almost 1000 years prior to their epoch. The city was already in ruins by the time of the Aztecs. For many years, archaeologists believed it was built by the Toltec. This belief was based on colonial period texts, such as the Florentine Codex, which attributed the site to the Toltecs. However, the Nahuatl word \"Toltec\" generally means \"craftsman of the highest level\" and may not always refer to the Toltec civilization centered at Tula, Hidalgo. Since Toltec civilization flourished centuries after Teotihuacan, the people could not have been the city's founders.\n\nIn the Late Formative era, a number of urban centers arose in central Mexico. The most prominent of these appears to have been Cuicuilco, on the southern shore of Lake Texcoco. Scholars have speculated that the eruption of the Xitle volcano may have prompted a mass emigration out of the central valley and into the Teotihuacan valley. These settlers may have founded or accelerated the growth of Teotihuacan.\n\nOther scholars have put forth the Totonac people as the founders of Teotihuacan. There is evidence that at least some of the people living in Teotihuacan immigrated from those areas influenced by the Teotihuacano civilization, including the Zapotec, Mixtec, and Maya peoples. The builders of Teotihuacan took advantage of the geography in the Basin of Mexico. From the swampy ground, they constructed raised beds, called chinampas, creating high agricultural productivity despite old methods of cultivation. This allowed for the formation of channels, and subsequently canoe traffic, to transport food from farms around the city. The earliest buildings at Teotihuacan date to about 200 BCE. The largest pyramid, the Pyramid of the Sun, was completed by 100 CE.\n\nIn January 378, while Spearthrower Owl supposedly ruled in Teotihuacan, the warlord Siyah K'ak' \"conquered\" Tikal, removing and replacing the Maya king, with support from El Peru and Naachtun, as recorded by Stela 31 at Tikal and other monuments in the Maya region.\n\nIn 426, the Copán ruling dynasty was created with K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' as the first king. The Dynasty went on to have sixteen rulers. Copán is located in modern-day Honduras, as described by Copán Altar Q(???). Soon thereafter, Yax K'uk' Mo' installed Tok Casper as king of Quiriguá, about 50 km north of Copán.\n\nThe city reached its peak in 450 CE, when it was the center of a powerful culture whose influence extended through much of the Mesoamerican region. At its peak, the city covered over 30 km² (over square miles), and perhaps housed a population of 150,000 people, with one estimate reaching as high as 250,000. Various districts in the city housed people from across the Teotihuacano region of influence, which spread south as far as Guatemala. Notably absent from the city are fortifications and military structures.\n\nThe nature of political and cultural interactions between Teotihuacan and the centers of the Maya region (as well as elsewhere in Mesoamerica) has been a long-standing and significant area for debate. Substantial exchange and interaction occurred over the centuries from the Terminal Preclassic to the Mid-Classic period. \"Teotihuacan-inspired ideologies\" and motifs persisted at Maya centers into the Late Classic, long after Teotihuacan itself had declined. However, scholars debate the extent and degree of Teotihuacano influence. Some believe that it had direct and militaristic dominance; others that adoption of \"foreign\" traits was part of a selective, conscious, and bi-directional cultural diffusion. New discoveries have suggested that Teotihuacan was not much different in its interactions with other centers from the later empires, such as the Toltec and Aztec. It is believed that Teotihuacan had a major influence on the Preclassic and Classic Maya, most likely by conquering several Maya centers and regions, including Tikal and the region of Peten, and influencing Maya culture.\n\nArchitectural styles prominent at Teotihuacan are found widely dispersed at a number of distant Mesoamerican sites, which some researchers have interpreted as evidence for Teotihuacan's far-reaching interactions and political or militaristic dominance. A style particularly associated with Teotihuacan is known as \"talud-tablero\", in which an inwards-sloping external side of a structure (\"talud\") is surmounted by a rectangular panel (\"tablero\"). Variants of the generic style are found in a number of Maya region sites, including Tikal, Kaminaljuyu, Copan, Becan, and Oxkintok, and particularly in the Petén Basin and the central Guatemalan highlands. The \"talud-tablero\" style pre-dates its earliest appearance at Teotihuacan in the Early Classic period; it appears to have originated in the Tlaxcala-Puebla region during the Preclassic. Analyses have traced the development into local variants of the \"talud-tablero\" style at sites such as Tikal, where its use precedes the 5th-century appearance of iconographic motifs shared with Teotihuacan. The \"talud-tablero\" style disseminated through Mesoamerica generally from the end of the Preclassic period, and not specifically, or solely, via Teotihuacano influence. It is unclear how or from where the style spread into the Maya region. During the zenith main structures of the site, including the pyramids, were painted in dark-red (maroon to Burgundy) colors (only small spots remain now) and were a very impressionable view.\n\nThe city was a center of industry, home to many potters, jewelers, and craftsmen. Teotihuacan is known for producing a great number of obsidian artifacts. No ancient Teotihuacano non-ideographic texts are known to exist (or known to have existed). Inscriptions from Maya cities show that Teotihuacan nobility traveled to, and perhaps conquered, local rulers as far away as Honduras. Maya inscriptions note an individual nicknamed by scholars as \"Spearthrower Owl\", apparently ruler of Teotihuacan, who reigned for over 60 years and installed his relatives as rulers of Tikal and Uaxactun in Guatemala.\n\nScholars have based interpretations about the culture at Teotihuacan on archaeology, the murals that adorn the site (and others, like the Wagner Murals, found in private collections), and hieroglyphic inscriptions made by the Maya describing their encounters with Teotihuacano conquerors. The creation of murals, perhaps tens of thousands of murals, reached its height between 450 and 650. The artistry of the painters was unrivaled in Mesoamerica and has been compared with that of painters in Renaissance Florence, Italy.\n\nScholars had thought that invaders attacked the city in the 7th or 8th century, sacking and burning it. More recent evidence, however, seems to indicate that the burning was limited to the structures and dwellings associated primarily with the ruling class. Some think this suggests that the burning was from an internal uprising. They say the invasion theory is flawed because early archaeological work on the city was focused exclusively on the palaces and temples, places used by the upper classes. Because all of these sites showed burning, archaeologists concluded that the whole city was burned. Instead, it is now known that the destruction was centered on major civic structures along the Avenue of the Dead. The sculptures inside palatial structures, such as Xalla, were shattered. No traces of foreign invasion are visible at the site.\n\nEvidence for population decline beginning around the 6th century lends some support to the internal unrest hypothesis. The decline of Teotihuacan has been correlated to lengthy droughts related to the climate changes of 535–536. This theory of ecological decline is supported by archaeological remains that show a rise in the percentage of juvenile skeletons with evidence of malnutrition during the 6th century. Which is why there is different evidence that helps indicate that famine is most likely one of the more possible reasons for the decline of Teotihuacan. The majority of their food came from agriculture, they grew things such as maize, bean, amaranth, green tomatoes(tomatillos?), and pumpkin. But their harvest was not nearly sufficient to feed a population as big as it is believed lived in Teotihuacan. This finding does not conflict with either of the above theories, since both increased warfare and internal unrest can also be effects of a general period of drought and famine. Other nearby centers such as Cholula, Xochicalco, and Cacaxtla competed to fill the power void left by Teotihuacan's decline. They may have aligned themselves against Teotihuacan to reduce its influence and power. The art and architecture at these sites emulate Teotihuacan forms, but also demonstrate an eclectic mix of motifs and iconography from other parts of Mesoamerica, particularly the Maya region.\n\nThe sudden destruction of Teotihuacan was common for Mesoamerican city-states of the Classic and Epi-Classic period. Many Maya states suffered similar fates in the coming centuries, a series of events often referred to as the Classic Maya collapse. Nearby in the Morelos valley, Xochicalco was sacked and burned in 900 and Tula met a similar fate around 1150.\n\nThere is a theory that the collapse of Teotihuacan was caused by its agriculture being devastated by the 535 CE eruption of the Ilopango volcano in El Salvador.\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that Teotihuacan was a multi-ethnic city, with distinct quarters occupied by Otomi, Zapotec, Mixtec, Maya, and Nahua peoples. The Totonacs have always maintained that they were the ones who built it. The Aztecs repeated that story, but it has not been corroborated by archaeological findings.\n\nIn 2001, Terrence Kaufman presented linguistic evidence suggesting that an important ethnic group in Teotihuacan was of Totonacan or Mixe–Zoquean linguistic affiliation. He uses this to explain general influences from Totonacan and Mixe–Zoquean languages in many other Mesoamerican languages, whose people did not have any known history of contact with either of the above-mentioned groups. Other scholars maintain that the largest population group must have been of Otomi ethnicity, because the Otomi language is known to have been spoken in the area around Teotihuacan both before and after the Classic period and not during the middle period.\n\nIn \"An Illustrated Dictionary of the Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico and the Maya\", Miller and Taube list eight deities:\n\nEsther Pasztory adds one more:\n\nThe consensus among scholars is that the primary deity of Teotihuacan was the Great Goddess of Teotihuacan. The dominant civic architecture is the pyramid. Politics were based on the state religion; religious leaders were the political leaders. Religious leaders would commission artists to create religious artworks for ceremonies and rituals.The artwork likely commissioned would have been a mural or a censer depicting gods like the Great Goddess of Teotihuacan or the Feathered Serpent. Censers would be lit during religious rituals to invoke the gods including rituals with human sacrifice. \n\nTeotihuacanos practiced human sacrifice: human bodies and animal sacrifices have been found during excavations of the pyramids at Teotihuacan. Scholars believe that the people offered human sacrifices as part of a dedication when buildings were expanded or constructed. The victims were probably enemy warriors captured in battle and brought to the city for ritual sacrifice to ensure the city could prosper. Some men were decapitated, some had their hearts removed, others were killed by being hit several times over the head, and some were buried alive. Animals that were considered sacred and represented mythical powers and military were also buried alive, imprisoned in cages: cougars, a wolf, eagles, a falcon, an owl, and even venomous snakes.\n\nNumerous stone masks have been found at Teotihuacan, and have been generally believed to have been used during a funerary context, although some scholars call this into question, noting that masks \"do not seem to have come from burials\".\n\nTeotihuacan was a mix of residential and work areas. Upper-class homes were usually compounds that housed many such families, and one compound was found that was capable of housing between sixty and eighty families. Such superior residences were typically made of plaster, each wall in every section elaborately decorated with murals. These compounds or apartment complexes were typically found within the city center. The vast lakes of the Basin of Mexico provided the opportunity for people living around them to construct productive raised beds, or chinampas, from swampy muck, construction that also produced channels between the beds.\n\nDifferent sections of the city housed particular ethnic groups and immigrants. Typically, multiple languages were spoken in these sections of the city.\n\nKnowledge of the huge ruins of Teotihuacan was never completely lost. After the fall of the city, various squatters lived on the site. During Aztec times, the city was a place of pilgrimage and identified with the myth of Tollan, the place where the sun was created. Today, Teotihuacan is one of the most noted archaeological attractions in Mexico.\n\nIn the late 17th century Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora (1645–1700) made some excavations around the Pyramid of the Sun. Minor archaeological excavations were conducted in the 19th century. In 1905 Mexican archaeologist and government official, in the regime of Porfirio Díaz, Leopoldo Batres led a major project of excavation and restoration. The Pyramid of the Sun was restored to celebrate the centennial of the Mexican War of Independence in 1910. The site of Teotihuacan was the first to be expropriated for the national patrimony under the Law of Monuments (1897), giving jurisdiction under legislation for the Mexican state to take control. Some 250 plots were farmed on the site. Peasants who had been farming portions were ordered to leave and the Mexican government eventually paid some compensation to those individuals. A feeder train line was built to the site in 1908, which allowed the efficient hauling of material from the excavations and later to bring tourists to the site. In 1910, the International Congress of Americanists met in Mexico, coinciding with the centennial celebrations, and the distinguished delegates, such as its president Eduard Seler and vice president Franz Boas were taken to the newly finished excavations.\n\nFurther excavations at the \"Ciudadela\" were carried out in the 1920s, supervised by Manuel Gamio. Other sections of the site were excavated in the 1940s and 1950s. The first site-wide project of restoration and excavation was carried out by INAH from 1960 to 1965, supervised by Jorge Acosta. This undertaking had the goals of clearing the Avenue of the Dead, consolidating the structures facing it, and excavating the Palace of \"Quetzalpapalotl\".\n\nDuring the installation of a \"sound and light\" show in 1971, workers discovered the entrance to a tunnel and cave system underneath the Pyramid of the Sun. Although scholars long thought this to be a natural cave, more recent examinations have established the tunnel was entirely manmade. The interior of the Pyramid of the Sun has never been fully excavated.\n\nIn 1980-82, another major program of excavation and restoration was carried out at the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent and the Avenue of the Dead complex. Most recently, a series of excavations at the Pyramid of the Moon have greatly expanded evidence of cultural practices.\n\nIn late 2003 a tunnel beneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent was accidentally discovered by Sergio Gómez Chávez and Julie Gazzola, archaeologists of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). After days of heavy rainstorm Gómez Chávez noticed that a nearly three-foot-wide sinkhole occurred near the foot of the temple pyramid.\n\nFirst trying to examine the hole with a flashlight from above Gómez could see only darkness, so tied with a line of heavy rope around his waist he was lowered by several colleagues, and descending into the murk he realized it was a perfectly cylindrical shaft. At the bottom he came to rest in apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was aware that archaeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun, and supposed he was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.\n\nPreliminary planning of the exploration and fundraising took more than six years.\n\nBefore the start of excavations, beginning in the early months of 2004, Dr. Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera, from UNAM Institute of Geophysics, determined with the help of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and a team of some 20 archaeologists and workers the approximate length of the tunnel and the presence of internal chambers. They scanned the earth under the Ciudadela, returning every afternoon to upload the results to Gómez’s computers. By 2005, the digital map was complete. The archaeologists explored the tunnel with a remote-controlled robot called Tlaloc II-TC, equipped with an infrared camera and a laser scanner that generates 3D visualization to perform three dimensional register of the spaces beneath the temple. A small opening in the tunnel wall was made and the scanner captured the first images, 37 meters into the passage.\n\nIn 2009, the government granted Gómez permission to dig. By the end of 2009 archaeologists of the INAH located the entrance to the tunnel that leads to galleries under the pyramid, where rests of rulers of the ancient city might have been deposited. In August 2010 Gómez Chávez, now director of \"Tlalocan Project: Underground Road\", announced that INAH's investigation of the tunnel - closed nearly 1,800 years ago by Teotihuacan dwellers - will proceed. The INAH team, consisted of about 30 persons supported with national and international advisors at the highest scientific levels, intended to enter the tunnel in September–October 2010. This excavation, the deepest made at the Pre-Hispanic site, was part of the commemorations of the 100th anniversary of archaeological excavations at Teotihuacan and its opening to the public.\n\nIt was mentioned that the underground passage runs under Feathered Serpent Temple, and the entrance is located a few meters away from the temple at the expected place, deliberately sealed with large boulders nearly 2,000 years ago. The hole that had appeared during the 2003 storms was not the actual entrance; a vertical shaft of almost 5 meters by side is the access to the tunnel. At 14 meters deep, the entrance leads to a nearly 100-meter long corridor that ends in a series of underground galleries in the rock. After archaeologists broke ground at the entrance of the tunnel, a staircase and ladders that would allow easy access to the subterranean site were installed. Works advanced slowly and with painstaking care; excavating was done manually, with spades. Nearly 1,000 tons of soil and debris were removed from the tunnel. There were large spiral seashells, cat bones, pottery, fragments of human skin. The rich array of objects unearthed included: wooden masks covered with inlaid rock jade and quartz, elaborate necklaces, rings, greenstone crocodile teeth and human figurines, crystals shaped into eyes, beetle wings arranged in a box, sculptures of jaguars, and hundreds of metallized spheres. The mysterious globes lay in both the north and south chambers. Ranging from 40 to 130 millimetres, the balls have a core of clay and are covered with a yellow jarosite formed by the oxidation of pyrite. According to George Cowgill of Arizona State University, the spheres are a fascinating find: \"Pyrite was certainly used by the Teotihuacanos and other ancient Mesoamerican societies. Originally, the spheres would have shown brilliantly. They are indeed unique, but I have no idea what they mean.\" All these artifacts were deposited deliberately and pointedly, as if in offering to appease the gods.\n\nOne of the most remarkable findings in the tunnel chambers was a miniature mountainous landscape, 17 metres underground, with tiny pools of liquid mercury representing lakes. The walls and ceiling of the tunnel were found to have been carefully impregnated with mineral powder composed of magnetite, pyrite (fool's gold), and hematite to provide a glittering brightness to the complex, and to create the effect of standing under the stars as a peculiar re-creation of the underworld. At the end of the passage, Gómez Chávez’s team uncovered four greenstone statues, wearing garments and beads; their open eyes would have shone with precious minerals. Two of the figurines were still in their original positions, leaning back and appearing to contemplate up at the axis where the three planes of the universe meet - likely the founding shamans of Teotihuacan, guiding pilgrims to the sanctuary, and carrying bundles of sacred objects used to perform rituals, including pendants and pyrite mirrors, which were perceived as portals to other realms.\n\nAfter each new segment was cleared, the 3D scanner documented the progress. By 2015 nearly 75,000 fragments of artifacts have been discovered, studied, cataloged, analyzed and, when possible, restored.\n\nThe significance of these new discoveries is publicly explored in a major exhibition at the De Young Museum in San Francisco, which opened in late September 2017.\n\nAs of January 23, 2018 the name \"Teotihuacan\" has come under scrutiny by experts, who now feel that the site's name may have been changed by Spanish colonizers in the 16th century. Archaeologist Veronica Ortega of the National Institute of Anthropology and History states that the city appears to have actually been named \"Teohuacan\", meaning \"City of the Sun\" rather than \"City of the Gods\", as the current name suggests.\n\nThe city's broad central avenue, called \"Avenue of the Dead\" (a translation from its Nahuatl name \"Miccoatli\"), is flanked by impressive ceremonial architecture, including the immense Pyramid of the Sun (third largest in the World after the Great Pyramid of Cholula and the Great Pyramid of Giza). Pyramid of the Moon and The Ciudadela with Temple of the Feathered Serpent Quetzalcoatl are placed at the both ends of Avenue while Palace-museum Quetzalpapálot, fourth basic structure of site, situated between two main pyramids. Along the Avenue are many smaller talud-tablero platforms also. The Aztecs believed they were tombs, inspiring the name of the avenue. Scholars have now established that these were ceremonial platforms that were topped with temples.\n\nThe Avenue of the dead is roughly forty meters wide and four Kilometers long. Further down the Avenue of the Dead, after small river, is the area known as the Citadel, containing the ruined Temple of the Feathered Serpent Quetzalcoatl. This area was a large plaza surrounded by temples that formed the religious and political center of the city. The name \"Citadel\" was given to it by the Spanish, who believed it was a fort. Most of the common people lived in large apartment buildings spread across the city. Many of the buildings contained workshops where artisans produced pottery and other goods.\n\nThe urban layout of Teotihuacan exhibits two slightly different orientations, which resulted from astronomical criteria, rather than topographic. The central part of the city, including the Avenue of the Dead, conforms to the orientation of the Sun Pyramid, while the southern part reproduces the orientation of the Ciudadela. The two constructions recorded sunrises and sunsets on particular dates, allowing the use of an observational calendar. During the time of 100 A.D., “the sunrises on February 11 and October 29 and sunsets on April 30 and August 13. The interval from February 11 and October 29, as well as from August 13 to April 30, is exactly 260 days”. The recorded dates are in multiples of 13 and 20 days, which align with the traditional Mesoamerican calendar. Furthermore, the Sun Pyramid is aligned to Cerro Gordo to the north, which means that it was purposefully built there to witness the sunrises on these specific dates along the horizon of the hills. The artificial cave under the pyramid additionally attests to the importance of this spot. \n\nThe fact that both orientations belong to alignment groups that are widespread in Mesoamerica can only be explained with the use of astronomical references at the horizon. Teotihuacan belongs to the E-Group, meaning that the alignment of their structures are in order to organize a calendar from the sunrises and sunsets of solstices, proving that the placement of the structures did not rely heavily on topographic criteria, but rather on astronomical alignments. An example of the rejection of the natural lay of the land is the placement of the San Juan River, as its placement was modified to bend around the structures as it goes through the centre of town eventually to return to its natural course outside of Teotihuacan.\n\nGiven that the E-Group were all in the same general region of Mesoamerica, means their calendar was used for agricultural purposes. The E-Group’s significance of the four main dates of their calendric year was for the purpose of agriculture. These dates signified the cycle of maize farming: February was for preparations, May brought rain which meant it was time to plant the maize, August was when the maize would begin to grow, and November was the time to harvest. This 260-day calendar was made by the Aztecs and was called the tonalpohualli. <ref>\n"}

It was established by Steven Spielberg in 1994, one year after completing his Academy Award-winning film \"Schindler's List.\" The original aim of the Institute was to record testimonies of survivors and other witnesses of the Holocaust (which in Hebrew is called the \"Shoah\") as a collection of videotaped interviews.\n\nIn January 2006, the Foundation partnered with and relocated to the University of Southern California and was renamed the USC Shoah Foundation – The Institute for Visual History and Education.\n\nThe Foundation conducted nearly 52,000 video testimonies between 1994 and 1999, and currently has more than 55,000 testimonies. The bulk of the video testimonies expound on the Holocaust, including such experiences as Jewish Survivors, Rescuers and Aid-Providers, Sinti and Roma Survivors, Liberators, Political Prisoners, Jehovah's Witness Survivors, War Crimes Trial Participants, Eugenic Policies Survivors, Non-Jewish Forced Laborers and Homosexual Survivors, but USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive expanded in 2013 to include testimonies of Tutsi survivors of the Genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda and has expanded in recent years to include interviews with survivors of other genocides, including the Armenian Genocide, Cambodian Genocide, Guatemalan Genocide, Nanjing Massacre in Nanjing, China, and the current violence against the Rohingya in Myanmar.\n\nThe vast majority of the testimonies contain a complete personal history of life before, during, and after the interviewee's firsthand experience with genocide.\n\nThe testimonies are preserved in the Visual History Archive, one of the largest digital collections of its kind in the world. The Visual History Archive is digitized, fully searchable via indexed keywords, and hyperlinked to the minute. With more than 112,000 hours of testimony stored in the Archive, indexing technology is essential for enabling users to pinpoint topics of interest. Indexing allows students, teachers, professors, researchers and others around the world to retrieve entire testimonies or search for specific sections within testimonies through a set of nearly 64,000 keywords and phrases, 1.8 million names, and 695,000 images. Each testimony is indexed by a native speaker and each minute of video is timecoded in English to a proprietary search engine using Institute-patented technology. They average a little over two hours each in length and were conducted in 63 countries and 41 languages.\n\nThe Institute has access to other primary resources in addition to the audio-visual testimonies. A Holocaust and Genocide Studies collection recently acquired by USC's Doheny Library contains more than 1,000 original Nazi books and pamphlets, Jewish publications, microfilms with original documents such as Nazi newspapers and a nearly complete series of original transcripts of the International Nuremberg trials. Also included in the Doheny collection: early Holocaust historiography; early post-war publications of diaries and testimonies in various languages; and original papers of German and Austrian refugees from the Third Reich, including those of the famous German-Jewish writer Lion Feuchtwanger.\n\nMeanwhile, the Institute's Visual History Archive is expanding its collection to include testimony from survivors and witnesses of other genocides, including the Genocide Against the Tutsi in Rwanda, the Nanjing Massacre, Armenian Genocide and Guatemalan Genocide. Sixty-four Rwandan testimonies were added in the spring of 2013, and 12 testimonies from survivors of the Nanjing Massacre were added in the spring of 2014, and 18 more were added in October 2014.\n\nThe Institute currently has 332 testimonies from the Armenian Genocide in the VHA, which were then integrated into the Visual History Archive by the event's April 24, 2015 centennial and to commemorate the 20th century's first genocide.\n\nThe Institute aspires to be the world's academic authority on the study of genocide and personal testimony. It continues to incorporate new collections of genocide eyewitness testimonies while simultaneously fostering scholarly activities that confront real-world problems the testimonies address. Scholars in many fields have utilized the vast resources of the Visual History Archive to teach more than 400 university courses across four continents, including 112 courses at USC. Researchers and thought leaders have utilized the testimonies in more than 121 scholarly works and the archive has been central to dozens of conferences across a range of disciplines.\n\nThe Center for Advanced Genocide Research is the research and scholarship unit of the Institute. Founded in 2014, the Center is dedicated to advancing new areas of interdisciplinary research on the Holocaust and genocide, specifically discussing the origins of genocide and how to intervene in the cycle that leads to mass violence..\nThe Center holds international conferences and workshops and hosts fellows and scholars in residence to conduct research using the vast resources available at the University of Southern California.\nThe Center will award up to 10 fellows every year.\nInstitute fellows, staff and student interns participate in more than a dozen academic events on the USC campus annually. It distinguishes itself by focusing on interdisciplinary study organized around three themes to advance the analysis of genocide and systematic mass violence on an international scale. Resistance to Genocide and Mass Violence focuses on acts of resistance and elements of defiance that slow down or stop genocidal processes. Violence, Emotion and Behavioral Change studies the nature of genocide and mass violence and how they impact emotional, social, psychological, historical and physical behavior.\n\nThe Institute, in conjunction with the Center for Advanced Genocide Research, held an international conference in November 2014 at USC titled \"Memory, Media and Technology: Exploring the Trajectories of Schindler's List,\" examining the trajectories of memory, media and technology throughout a range of disciplines and from a variety of vantage points and venues. In 2015, the Center for Advanced Genocide Research in collaboration with the Thornton School of Music and USC Visions and Voices hosted the international conference titled \"Singing in the Lion's Mouth: Music as Resistance to Violence\" which include two days of programming that highlight the use of music as a tool to resist oppression and spread awareness.\n\nDigital Genocide Studies examines how big data and large datasets, including the 53,000 testimonies in the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive, can be used to find patterns in the field of mass violence and its resistance. The Institute also organizes a yearly series of academic events that brings scholars to USC to present lectures, film screenings and panel discussions. The Visual History Archive is fully viewable at 51 subscribing institutions in 13 countries around the world, mainly universities and museums. The Institute also offers a subscription for partial access to the Archive. About 211 institutions in 34 countries have contracted for these smaller collections.\n\nAbout 1,200 testimonies are also available to any member of the public with an Internet connection who registers to access the Visual History Archive Online. In addition to broadening its reach, the Institute dedicates considerable attention to maintaining each testimony's audio-visual quality, to protect it from degrading over time. With contributions from technology companies, the Institute devised a preservation system where the original videos were digitized into a variety of commonly used formats. The digitization of the entire Archive took five years to complete, from 2008 to 2012. During the digitization project, it was discovered that about 5 percent of the 235,005 tapes had audio or visual problems, some to the point of being unwatchable. Finding there were few existing options for restoring tape-based material, the Institute's ITS team created new software programs to help them recover both audio and visual problems. To ensure that the world's largest database of genocide testimony lives in perpetuity, the Institute has created a digital collections management technology used by clients to preserve their aging media. Among them are the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences and Warner Bros. Pictures. Also under the Access umbrella is the Institute's collections unit, which works to expand the Visual History Archive by conducting additional interviews, integrating testimony taken by other institutions, and providing training on the Institute's preferred methodology for gathering testimony.\n\nUsing testimony from the Visual History Archive, the Institute develops teaching tools for educators across the disciplinary spectrum, such as social studies, English Language Arts, government, foreign language, world history, American history, and character education. The Institute also provides professional development to prepare educators worldwide to use testimony in relevant and engaging ways—providing an experience that takes students beyond the textbook.\n\nIWitness, the Institute's flagship educational website for teachers and their students, provides students access to 1,600 testimonies for guided exploration. Students can engage with the testimonies and bring them into their own multimedia projects via a built-in video editor. \nApproximately 17,000 high school students and over 5,000 educators in 57 countries and all 50 U.S. states have used IWitness. The Institute has trained more than 39,000 educators around the world to incorporate testimony into classroom lessons.\nMore than 200 educators have participated in advanced training and the Teaching with Testimony in the 21st Century programs in the U.S., Ukraine, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland.\n\nThe Institute's other education programs include:\n\nTestimony is reaching a broad international audience through the Institute's Visual History Archive, as well as IWitness, its YouTube channel, and its Web portals in 12 languages. The complete Visual History Archive is available at 49 institutions around the world, while smaller collections are available at 199 sites in 33 countries. The Institute will continue to develop digital technologies to preserve and enhance the Visual History Archive, while building access pathways for a broad audience of students, educators, scholars and the general public. \nApproximately 1.6 million students, researchers, teachers and laypersons view the testimonies every year.\nThe Visual History Archive Online (vhaonline.usc.edu) features more than 1,200 testimonies accessible worldwide.\n\nWith an eye toward expanding its audience, USC Shoah Foundation broadcasts its content across many platforms. In 2015, to underscore this priority, the Institute added Global Outreach as its fourth organizational pillar. The progress has been remarkable. In one year — between 2013–14 and 2014–15 — the number of people intersecting with the Institute's testimony nearly doubled, from 3.6 million to 6.5 million. The number increases to 15 million when including media exposure, TV broadcasts, museum exhibits, presentations at conferences and workshops, and social media. Global outreach is conducted through owned media such as websites and Institute supported documentaries and exhibits; earned media including prominent national and international press coverage about its programs; and shared media distributed across a wide range of social platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34046849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34046849", "title": "United States Factor", "text": "United States Factor\n\nThe United States Factor is a view of modern history that promotes the United States as the contingent reason for the Allied Powers winning both World Wars and for preventing any powerful rival political regime from becoming mainstream in the 21st century world.\n\nAzar Gat, argues that this \"United States Factor\" is both widely overlooked and the reason for democracy's victory over totalitarianism in the 20th century.\n\nAccording to the United States Factor notion, \"if it were not for the existence of the USA the liberal democracies would most probably have lost the great struggles of the twentieth century.\"\n\nThe 20th century did appear to witness what many theorists have seen as the end of the battles of political ideology, with the political model of liberal democracy coming out on top. Indeed, political scientists, including Francis Fukuyama, hailed the fall of the Soviet Union as the \"end of history\" in which the ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy [becomes] the final form of human government.\" (See End of History and the Last Man)\n\nIn the view of the United States Factor, this \"end of history\" is made possible only because the USA was in a unique space economically, geographically, politically, and militarily throughout the 20th century that made it possible for the United States to \"rescue\" the Old World powers from the threat of totalitarianism. These menaces included both right wing totalitarian regimes, such as Nazism, as well as left wing totalitarianism—better known as Soviet-era Communism. (See State ideology of the Soviet Union)\n\nThough Gat acknowledges that the victory of democracy over totalitarianism was not necessarily \"preordained\" at the outset of either World War, he goes on to remark that the sheer fact that the USA existed gave liberal democracies their \"edge\" in the battle against totalitarian regimes. This was achieved mainly by the USA's contributions to the European Allies' war efforts from a distant location that was geographically large and politically united.\n\nThis is a view of modern history that fits within the political theory of American exceptionalism. American exceoptionalism, as defined by Jentleson, is a theory that holds that the United States possesses an inherent uniqueness and \"special virtue\" that is rooted in American principles and can be traced throughout American history. The idea that the United States is exceptional, or extraordinary, simply because it is the United States is a political philosophy that has been in existence for several decades and is a leading contributor to contemporary American political culture. (See Politics of the United States)\n\nThere are many other ideas as to the behaviors of states and how they react and interact in the world. Such views that provide alternate theories to American exceptionalism and the United States Factor include realism, constructivism, and idealism, just to name a few. These are some of the popular theories used in today's discussions about International Relations. They put emphasis on states' behaviors and how to forecast potential outcomes of the entire spectrum of international affairs, from militarized conflict to diplomacy.\n"}

It makes the claim that the \"vimānas\" mentioned in ancient Sanskrit epics were advanced aerodynamic flying vehicles.\n\nThe existence of the text was revealed in 1952 by G. R. Josyer who asserted that it was written by Pandit Subbaraya Shastry (1866–1940), who dictated it during the years 1918–1923. A Hindi translation was published in 1959, while the Sanskrit text with an English translation was published in 1973. It contains 3000 shlokas in 8 chapters which Shastry claimed was psychically delivered to him by the ancient Hindu sage Bharadvaja. The text has gained favour among proponents of ancient astronaut theories.\n\nA study by aeronautical and mechanical engineering researchers at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, in 1974 concluded that the aircraft described in the text were \"poor concoctions\" and that the author showed a complete lack of understanding of aeronautics. Regarding the \"Rukma Vimana\", the study noted, \"If the craft is taken to mean what the drawing and the text say, it can be stated that the craft is a decided impossibility\".\n\nSubbaraya Shastry was a mystic from Anekal, who was reputed to speak out verses (\"slokas\") whenever he got inspiration, described by Josyer as \"a walking lexicon gifted with occult perception\". According to Josyer, he dictated the text to G. Venkatachala Sharma in the early 1900s (completing it in 1923). According to the history unearthed by Mukunda et al., Shastry was born in a small village in Hosur Taluk. His parents died at a young age and he was diseased and in a poor state. While wandering, he met a great saint at Kolar, who initiated him into spirituality and revealed to him several shastras, including the Vimana Shastra. Afterwards, Shastri settled into normal life. Shastri had no formal schooling and learnt to read and write only after returning from his encounter with the saint. It is unlikely the text was his own invention.\n\nSubbaraya Shastry died in 1941, and Venkatachala took his manuscripts into keeping. The \"Vaimānika Śāstra\" manuscript appeared at Rajakiya Sanskrit Library, Baroda by 1944.\nThe text was published in Hindi in 1959 and later in English by G.R. Josyer, titled \"Vymanika Shastra\". Josyer's edition also added illustrations drawn by T. K. Ellappa, a draughtsman at a local engineering college in Bangalore, under the direction of Shastry, which had been missed in the 1959 edition.\n\nIts existence was first announced publicly in a 1952 press release by G.R. Josyer, who had founded his \"International Academy of Sanskrit Research\" in Mysore the year before. In the foreword to the 1973 publication that contained the full Sanskrit text with English translation, Josyer quotes a 1952 press release of his which was \"published in all the leading dailies of India, and was taken up by Reuter and other World Press News Services\":\n\nMr. G. R. Josyer, Director of the International Academy of Sanskrit Research in Mysore, in the course of an interview recently, showed some very ancient manuscripts which the Academy had collected. He claimed that the manuscripts were several thousands of years old, compiled by ancient rishis, Bharadwaja, Narada and others, dealing, not with the mysticism of ancient Hindu philosophy of Atman or Brahman, but with more mundane things vital for the existence of man and progress of nations both in times of peace and war.\n[...] One manuscript dealt with Aeronautics, construction of various types of aircraft for civil aviation and for warfare. [...] Mr. Josyer showed some types of designs and drawing of a helicopter-type cargo-loading plane, specially meant for carrying combustibles and ammunition, passenger aircraft carrying 400 to 500 persons, double and treble-decked aircraft. Each of these types had been fully described.\nJosyer then tells how he was visited by \"Miss Jean Lyon, journalist of Toronto and New York\" for an interview, and how Lyon in her \"Just Half a World Away\" (1954) concluded that he was \"guilty of a rabid nationalism, seeking to wipe out everything since the Vedas\".\n\nA critical review pronounced Josyer's introduction to be \"least scholarly by any standards\" and said that \"the people connected with publication – directly or indirectly – are solely to blame either for distorting or hiding the history of the manuscripts\", perhaps in an attempt to \"eulogise and glorify whatever they can find about our past, even without valid evidence\". By tracing the provenance of the manuscript, interviewing associates of Shastry (including G. V. Sharma to whom the text was originally dictated), and based on the linguistic analysis of the text, the review concluded that it came into existence sometime between 1900 and 1922.\n\nUnlike modern treatises on aeronautics that begin by discussing the general principles of flight before detailing concepts of aircraft design, the \"Vaimānika Śāstra\" starts with a quantitative description, as though a particular aircraft is being described. The topics covered include, \"definition of an airplane, a pilot, aerial routes, food, clothing, metals, metal production, mirrors and their uses in wars, varieties of machinery and yantras, planes like ‘mantrik’, ‘tantrik’, and ‘kritak’\" and four planes called \"Shakuna\", \"Sundara\", \"Rukma\", and \"Tripura\" are described in greater detail. The extant text is claimed to be only a small (one-fortieth) part of a larger work \"Yantra Sarvaswa\" (\"All about machines\") composed by Maharishi Bharadwaj and other sages for the \"benefit of all mankind\".\n\nJ. B. Hare of the Internet Sacred Text Archive in 2005 compiled an online edition of Josyer's 1973 book, in the site's \"UFOs\" section. In his introduction, Hare writes\n\nThe \"Vaimānika Śāstra\" was first committed to writing between 1918 and 1923, and nobody is claiming that it came from some mysterious antique manuscript. The fact is, there are no manuscripts of this text before 1918, and \"nobody is claiming that there are\". So on one level, this is not a hoax. You just have to buy into the assumption that 'channeling' works.\nthere is no exposition of the theory of aviation (let alone antigravity). In plain terms, the VS. never directly explains how Vimanas get up in the air. The text is top-heavy with long lists of often bizarre ingredients used to construct various subsystems. \nThere is nothing here which Jules Verne couldn't have dreamed up, no mention of exotic elements or advanced construction techniques. The 1923 technical illustration based on the text ... are absurdly un-aerodynamic. They look like brutalist wedding cakes, with minarets, huge ornithopter wings and dinky propellers. In other words, they look like typical early 20th century fantasy flying machines with an Indian twist.\nA 1974 study by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, found that the heavier-than-air aircraft that the \"Vaimānika Śāstra\" described were aeronautically unfeasible. The authors remarked that the discussion of the principles of flight in the text were largely perfunctory and incorrect, in some cases violating Newton's laws of motion. The study concluded:\n\nAny reader by now would have concluded the obvious – that the planes described above are the best poor concoctions, rather than expressions of something real. None of the planes has properties or capabilities of being flown; the geometries are unimaginably horrendous from the point of view of flying; and the principles of propulsion make them resist rather than assist flying. The text and the drawings do not correlate with each other even thematically. The drawings definitely point to a knowledge of modern machinery. This can be explained on the basis of the fact that Shri Ellappa who made the drawings was in a local engineering college and was thus familiar with names and details of some machinery. Of course the text retains a structure in language and content from which its 'recent nature' cannot be asserted. We must hasten to point out that this does not imply an oriental nature of the text at all. All that may be said is that thematically the drawings ought to be ruled out of discussion. And the text, as it stands, is incomplete and ambiguous by itself and incorrect at many places.\nThe authors expressed puzzlement at the contradiction and errors in the \"Vaimānika Śāstra\" text, especially since its compilers supposedly had access to publications that did not make such errors (such as Dayanand Saraswati's commentary on the Rigveda published in 1878 or earlier).\n\nThe 102nd Indian Science Congress held at the Mumbai University in January 2015 organised a session on \"ancient sciences through Sanskrit\" in which a presentation on \"Vaimānika Śāstra\" was included. It was delivered by Anand J. Bodas, a pilot, and Ameya Jadhav, who holds in an M.A. in Sanskrit as well as an M.Tech. degree. Bodas, speaking to the news media, has said that the aeroplanes of Vedic times could fly not only from country to country, but also \"from planet to planet.\" \"In those days, aeroplanes were huge in size, and could move left, right, as well as backwards, unlike modern planes which only fly forward,\" he added. Ram Prasad Gandhiraman, a NASA scientist, launched an on-line petition demanding that the talk be cancelled as it represents pseudo-science.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born about 1385 at Haddington, East Lothian, in the Kingdom of Scotland.\n\nBower was trained at the University of St Andrews and became the abbot of the Augustinian community on Inchcolm in 1417. He also acted as one of the commissioners for the collection of the ransom of King James I of Scotland in 1423 and 1424. Later, in 1433, he took part in a diplomatic mission to Paris to discuss the possibility of marriage of the king's daughter to the Dauphin of France. He played an important part at the Council of Perth of 1432 in the defence of Scottish rights.\n\nDuring Bower's closing years he was engaged on his work, the \"Scotichronicon\", on which his reputation now chiefly rests. This work, undertaken in 1440 by desire of a neighbour, Sir David Stewart of Rosyth Castle, was a continuation of the \"Chronica Gentis Scotorum\" of John of Fordun. The completed work, in its original form, consisted of sixteen books, of which the first five and a portion of the sixth (to 1163) are Fordun's—or mainly his, for Bower added to them at places. In the later books, down to the reign of Robert I (1371), he was aided by Fordun's \"Gesta Annalia\", but from that point to the close the work is original and of contemporary importance, especially for James I, with whose death it ends. The task was finished in 1447.\n\nIn the two remaining years of Bower's life he was engaged on a reduction or \"abridgment\" of this work, which is known as the \"Book of Cupar\", and is preserved in the Advocates' library, Edinburgh (MS. 35. 1. 7). Other abridgments, not by Bower, were made about the same time, one about 1450 (perhaps by Patrick Russell, a Carthusian monk of Perth), also preserved in the Advocates' library (MS. 35. 6. 7) and another in 1461 by an unknown writer, preserved in the same collection (MS. 35. 5. 2). Copies of the full text of the \"Scotichronicon\", by different scribes, still exist. There are two in the British Library, in \"The Black Book of Paisley\", and in Harl. MS. 712; one in the Advocates' library, from which Walter Goodall printed his edition (Edin., 1759), and one in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.\n\nSee also W. F. Skene's edition of Fordun in the series of \"Historians of Scotland\" (1871). Personal references are to be found in the \"Exchequer Rolls of Scotland\", iii. and iv.\n\nA revised and updated translation of Bower's work was produced under the leadership of Professor D. E. R. Watt, in nine volumes, published between 1987 and 1997. The critical edition of Bower's Latin text in Watt et al. has been amended and corrected by Chris Nighman in light of the discovery that Bower made extensive use of Thomas of Ireland's collection of authoritative quotations, the \"Manipulus florum\" (1306).\n"}
