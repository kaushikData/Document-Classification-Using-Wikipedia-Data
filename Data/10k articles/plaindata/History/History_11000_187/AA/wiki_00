{"id": "56002415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56002415", "title": "/r/IAmA", "text": "/r/IAmA\n\n/r/IAmA is a subreddit for question-and-answer interactive interviews termed \"AMA\" (short for \"Ask Me Anything\"). AMA interviewees have ranged from various celebrities to everyday people in several lines of work. Founded in May 2009, the subreddit has gone on to become one of Reddit's most popular communities.\n\nIAmA is based around posting \"AMAs\" (for \"Ask Me Anything\"), or similarly \"AMAAs\" (Ask Me Almost/Absolutely Anything) – prompts for others to ask questions about any topic. AMAs are open to all Reddit users, but interviewees require proof that they are who/what they claim to be. They use the site's comment system for both questions and answers; this process has been equated to an online press conference. Like the rest of Reddit, users can also upvote and downvote potential candidates - with the most favoured being more likely to receive an answer.\n\nAccording to \"The Atlantic\", this concept is new to the digital age. They deemed the closest equivalents to be game shows, and radio call-in shows, which placed a heavy focus on the interviewees. Contrastingly, /r/IAmA places more emphasis on users answering the questions.\n\nThe concept's genesis on the internet began in the 1990s; Slashdot launched similar interviews in 1999, but only 10 questions per person were allowed. Participants included free software advocate Bruce Perens and Linux developer Alan Cox. This was followed by Something Awful's Ask/Tell forums, which was more focused on interviews with everyday people. \n\nReddit built on this idea with video interviews with site staff Alexis Ohanian and Erik Martin. The following demand for AMAs led to the creation of the current /r/IAmA subreddit in May 2009. Unlike its precursors, it requires proof of identity. Since its founding, similar features have appeared in other social media sites, like Tumblr and Ask.fm.\n\nInitially, AMAs focused more on ordinary citizens; these interviews still make up some of the subreddit's content today. As Reddit expanded, its staff attempted to bring in celebrity guests—early examples include businesswoman Caterina Fake. Since then, a number of individuals have been interviewed in the IAmA subreddit, some of whom have appeared multiple times. Notable participants include then-United States President Barack Obama (while campaigning for the 2012 election), Bill Gates (multiple times), and Bernie Sanders (amidst the 2018 midterm elections). Other people, including Donald Trump, have conducted AMAs in a similar fashion on other parts of Reddit.\n\nThe increased traffic for Obama's AMA brought down many parts of the website when it occurred on August 29, 2012.\n\nCelebrities participating in AMAs have seen both positive and negative responses. In 2012, Woody Harrelson's AMA was criticized after Harrelson declined to answer questions that were unrelated to the movie he was then promoting. By contrast, rapper Snoop Dogg's 2012 AMA attracted 1.6 million page views after he provided several candid responses to the community's questions.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2015, Victoria Taylor assisted reddit's volunteer community in presenting interviews. She primarily transcribed spoken celebrity responses, but also helped organize timing, affirmed best practices, and assisted in preparation. On July 2, 2015, hundreds of subreddits, including several with over a million subscribers, were set to private by their respective volunteer moderators after Taylor was dismissed. These moderators stated that a primary factor for the shutdown was a lack of warning for Reddit's decision; Reddit provided no immediate replacement for Taylor's services. Sources closer to Reddit users cited an increased focus on commercializing AMAs as the most likely reason.\n\n"}

{"id": "2066627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2066627", "title": "Agranat Commission", "text": "Agranat Commission\n\nThe Agranat Commission (Hebrew: ועדת אגרנט) was a National Commission of Inquiry set up to investigate failings in the Israel Defense Forces in the prelude to the Yom Kippur War, when Israel was found unprepared for the Egyptian attack against the Bar Lev Line and a simultaneous attack by Syria in the Golan—the first phase in a war in which 2,812 Israeli soldiers were killed.\n\nThe commission was an official National Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Israeli government to investigate the circumstances leading to the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. The Committee was headed by Shimon Agranat, Chief Justice of Israel's Supreme Court. Its other members were Justice Moshe Landau, State Comptroller Yitzchak Nebenzahl, and former Chiefs of Staff Yigael Yadin and Chaim Laskov. The Committee sat for 140 sessions, during which they listened to the testimony of 58 witnesses. It was established on 21 November 1973 with a remit to investigate:\n\nIt did not examine the later stages of the war when the IDF went on the offensive.\n\nOn 31 December 1973, elections that had been delayed by the war took place. Likud, a new political party, won 39 seats in the Knesset. Newly elected Member of Knesset and one of the Likud founders, Reserve General Ariel Sharon gave a newspaper interview in which he was quoted as saying that he would disobey orders that he felt were against the interests of the State or his subordinates. This caused so much public concern that Sharon was asked to appear before the Commission, which accepted his testimony that the quote was in the context of a specific event which occurred under very exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe commission's report was published in three parts. The interim report, released 1 April 1974, called for the dismissal of a number of senior officers in the IDF and caused such controversy that Prime Minister Golda Meir was forced to resign. The second part was published 10 July 1974 and contained the reasons for the conclusions of the first report. The final part of the report was published on 30 January 1975. One consequence of the Commission's investigation was the \"Basic Law: The Army (1975)\", clarifying the IDF's legal status.\n\nPublished on 1 April 1974, the Interim Report caused a sensation. Its headline recommendation was the dismissal of four senior officers in military intelligence: The Chief of Military Intelligence Major General Eliyahu Zeira, his deputy Brigadier Aryeh Shalev, the head of the Egyptian Department Lt Colonel Yona Bendman, and the chief intelligence officer in the Southern Command Lt Colonel David Gedalia. The report also was critical of what it called the \"concept\" in military intelligence thinking. The \"concept\" was based on the assumption that Egypt would only attack if it had the air-power to take on the Israeli Air Force. Military intelligence also thought that Syria would only attack if Egypt did. In the absence of any upgrading of Egypt's air force, the directorate concluded there was no threat of imminent war. This assumption led to complacency and evidence being ignored. For example, on 1 October and again on 3 October 1973, Lieutenant Benjamin Siman Yov, order of battle intelligence officer for the Southern Command, gave his superior Lt Colonel Gadalia documents indicating Egypt's war preparations.\n\nIn its examination of the senior echelons of the IDF, the commission also concluded that GOC Southern Command Shmuel Gonen should be dismissed. After his departure, Gonen argued that he had only been in the post for a few months and that the command had been neglected by his predecessor Ariel Sharon.\nThe Commission also found Chief of Staff David Elazar responsible, but it refused to give an opinion on the responsibility of the Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan, arguing that this was beyond its remit.\n\nThis report caused public uproar and unhappiness in the army. In Abba Eban's words \"The conclusions ... did not seem to accord with the narrative\" Yitzhak Rabin walked out of the cabinet with Elazar. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets. Nine days after the publication of the Interim Report, Golda Meir announced the resignation of her government.\n\nAfter his dismissal, Elazar maintained that had he been given more of the information, he would have mobilized the IDF sooner. This only confirmed the Commission's criticisms about the reliance on a single avenue for intelligence analysis. Elazar died two years later aged 48.\n\nThe final part of the report was published on 30 January 1975. The completed report was 1,500 pages long, with 746 pages devoted to the fighting in the south and 311 to the northern front. Forty two pages were made public, the remainder being classified. Besides the IDF's failures, it looked at the issues around civilian and political control of the army and found a \"lack of clear definitions...\". Surprisingly, they could not find a clear statement of civilian control over the military. They argued that the Basic Law: The Cabinet (1968) implied authority when it stated that the Cabinet has authority over all areas not covered by other legislation. Later critics argued that the Cabinet's authority stemmed from the IDF Order (1948), which authorised the Minister of Defence to set up the army. Further questions arose over hundreds of orders issued by Chiefs of Staff since 1948 without authorisation from the Minister of Defence. These discoveries led to the swift enactment of Basic Law: The Army (1975). Its main clause stated:\n\nThe new law still left some issues unresolved, such as who appoints a Chief of Staff and whether the Chief of Staff was the most senior officer in the army.\n\nIn practice, the controversy about the report's absence of criticism of Moshe Dayan led to a strengthening of the Chief of Staff's position since he could argue that if the Chief of Staff had sole responsibility, it must be the Chief of Staff's decision. The Chief of Staff was now a regular attender of cabinet meetings.\n\nThe Commission was critical of the standard of everyday discipline in the IDF: \"Discipline is indivisible. For example, a soldier who becomes accustomed in time of peace not to observe the minor rules, such as in matters of personal appearance, without being alerted to this failure by his superior officer, will in the end be negligent in carrying out operational orders.\"\n\nAs a response to the Commission's criticism of using military intelligence as the sole route for analysis of information, the Foreign Ministry established a Research and Planning Department. Despite this, five years later the 29th Comptrollers Report into the conduct of the IDF during Operation Litani, which left 21 IDF soldiers dead, concluded that conditions remained the same as in 1973. The Report's author was Yitzhak Nebenzahl, a member of the Agranat Commission.\n\nThe full text of the report, except for 48 pages, was made public 1 January 1995.\n\nThe findings of the Agranat Commission have been the focus of sharp debate among the Israeli public up until today. Particular criticism relates to its exoneration of the country's political leadership, especially Defense Minister Dayan. According to the Report: \"As long as he accepts the opinions of his advisers, he does not bear any personal responsibility.\"\n\nFurther criticism responds to the Commission's recommendations, stemming from the failure of military intelligence to assess the Arab states' intent, that the IDF should not consider the intentions of hostile states, but rather their capacity for war. Thirty years later, Giora Eiland, head of the National Security Council, wrote: \"Both the proscription against considering intent and the concentration on the prevention of threats—two central messages of the Agranat Commission [Report]—frustrated and delayed the rebuilding and preparedness of the IDF for years.\"\n\n\n"}

He originated two major US library collections in the history of science and technology.\n\nDibner was born in Lisianka, near Kiev, Ukraine in 1897. His family was Jewish. He moved to the United States with his family at the age of 7. In 1921, he graduated from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn with a degree in Electrical Engineering. \n\nSoon after graduating, Dibner designed and patented the first solderless electrical connectors and founded the Burndy Engineering Company in 1924. The company later became the Burndy Corporation and was bought by the French corporation Framatome Connectors International (FCI) in 1988. In 2009, Burndy was acquired and became a subsidiary of Hubbell Incorporated. Dibner died at his home in Wilton, Connecticut on January 6, 1988.\n\nThe \"Burndy\" appellation, used for both his company and the library he would found, was invented by Dibner himself and represents a portmanteau or blend of his first and last names.\n\nIn addition to electrical engineering, Dibner studied the history of technology. He was an avid collector of original scientific works and of books on the history of science, as well as thousands of portraits of various scientists. Bern Dibner also wrote a great number of books on the history of science, such as \"The Atlantic Cable\" in 1955. In 1976 he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society.\n\nDibner, who was fascinated by both art and technology, found great pleasure in studying Leonardo da Vinci. This interest led him to obtain a small library of works about da Vinci which grew over the years as Dibner's interests expanded into the history of electricity, the history of Renaissance technology, and finally the history of science and technology in general. His collection continued to grow, and in 1941 he formally set up the Burndy Library as a separate institution \"to advance scholarship in the history of science.\" By 1964, the Burndy Library collection totaled over 40,000 volumes and Dibner opened a new building in Norwalk, Connecticut, to house the Library.\n\nIn 1974, Bern Dibner donated one-quarter of the Burndy Library's then holdings to the Smithsonian Institution to form the nucleus of a research library in the history of science and technology, to be located in the decade-old National Museum of History and Technology (now called The National Museum of American History: Kenneth E. Behring Center). In 1976, the Smithsonian's Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology was established, providing the Smithsonian Institution Libraries with its first rare book collection, containing many of the major works dating from the fifteenth to the early nineteenth centuries in the history of science and technology including engineering, transportation, chemistry, mathematics, physics, electricity and astronomy. The Smithsonian Dibner Library, then numbering 35,000 volumes, was reopened after construction in spring 2010, and is located in the National Museum of American History on the National Mall in Washington DC. The Smithsonian Institution Libraries have cataloged the books and manuscripts of the Dibner Library and entered the records into the international database OCLC and the Smithsonian's own online catalog, SIRIS.\n\nAfter Bern Dibner's death in 1988, the Burndy Library moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1992, where it became the research library for the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In November 2006, the complete Burndy Library collection, by then consisting of 67,000 rare volumes and a collection of scientific instruments, was donated to and became part of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, where it is available to scholars. The Huntington Library now offers a Dibner History of Science Program to fund fellowships, a lecture series and annual conference.\n\n\n\n"}

Joseph left in 1985 and was replaced by David Lawson. The group initially came together as students at Portsmouth Polytechnic (their backgrounds included sociology, fine art and psychology), and after graduation relocated to Hackney in east London.\n\nThe formation of the Black Audio Film Collective, like that of Sankofa Film and Video Collective, was a response to the social unrest in Britain in the 1980s: \"Influenced by contemporary debate on post-colonialism and social theorists such as Homi Bhabha and Stuart Hall, both groups centered around investigations of black identity/culture within the British experience and reworked the documentary to articulate new voices in British cinema.\"\n\nThe BAFC's output has been variously described as \"an extraordinary body of poetic, allusive, and intensely personal films, videos, and 'slide-tape texts' that chronicled England’s multicultural past and present and pushed the boundaries of the documentary form\", and as \"the expression of a generation of diasporic subjects that seized the idea of 'blackness' as an identity marker as well as a claim to political visibility.\" The pioneering films they produced are still considered influential.\n\nAccording to \"Guardian\" critic Adrian Searle, \"the works the BAFC made during the 80s and early 1990s are almost shocking in their range... The collective was heavily informed by film and psychoanalytic theory, by political discussion and debate... Perhaps the most significant achievement of the group was the formulation of a poetic, a tone of voice, a particular kind of filmic space that resisted categorisation.\" In the words of Kodwo Eshun, they \"projected a stance of high seriousness with seductive stylishness\".\n\nBAFC produced what the British Film Institute identifies as \"some of the most challenging and experimental documentaries in Britain in the 1980s\". Notable among their oeuvre is 1986's \"Handsworth Songs\", a film essay that makes unconventional use of newsreel and archive material of the autumn 1985 civil disturbances in Birmingham and London to explore memories of immigration and the different ways in which race was experienced and British society dealt with the black presence. Kodwo Eshun, writing in 2004, referred to the reputation of \"Handsworth Songs\" \"as the most important and influential art film to emerge from England in the last twenty years.\"\n\nThe collective was dissolved in 1998, after which John Akomfrah, Lina Gopaul and David Lawson went on to found Smoking Dogs Films. The first major retrospective of the BAFC, entitled \"The Ghosts of Songs\", toured between 2 February and 1 April 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

Its name derives from its reputation since ancient times as the place where the playwright Euripides came to write his tragedies. The ancient authors Philochorus and Satyrus described Euripides as a misanthrope who avoided society by lurking in a cave. The second century Roman author Aulus Gellius claimed to have visited the \"grim and gloomy cavern\" during his visit to Athens (Attic Nights XV.20).\n\nIn the 1990s, excavations were carried out under the direction of Yannos G. Lolos, Assistant Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology at the University of Ioannina, Epirus, in collaboration with the Department of Palaeoanthropology of the Greek Ministry of Culture.\n\nFinds date from the late Neolithic onward. They include stone implements and arrowheads; Mycenaean burials; 5th century BC Attic black glaze pottery; Roman period coins and votive figurines; and jewellery from the Frankish period, generally suggesting its long-term use as a place of refuge and worship. The most notable discovery was a fragmentary black-glaze skyphos dating from the late 5th century BC, with the letters ΕΥΡΙΠΠ, clearly part of the name Euripides, carefully inscribed in letters of the Hellenistic or Roman period. Lolos interpreted the cup as a votive offering to Euripides, confirmation of the devotion his poetry inspired in later periods.\n\nLolos also uncovered the foundations of a small rural sanctuary about 70 meters southwest of the cave, on the trail from the shore. Based on a marble phallus and other finds, he interpreted it as a sanctuary of Dionysus, the patron god of Greek theatre.\n\nThe cave, unsignposted, is located between the settlements of Peristeria and Kolones, about 350 meters northwest of the north end of Euripides Street, up a clear footpath. There is a steel door.\n\n"}

Her father was of Irish descent and her mother was a New Zealander of part-Māori descent. During her childhood, the family moved around a great deal and she was also \"a voracious reader\".\n\nHer family eventually settled in Sydney where she attended Holy Cross College, Woollahra, having a strong interest in both science and the humanities.\n\nShe had a younger brother, Carl, who drowned off the coast of Crete when he was 25 while trying to rescue tourists in difficulty. She based a character in \"The Thorn Birds\" on him, and also wrote about him in \"Life Without the Boring Bits\".\n\nBefore her tertiary education, McCullough earned a living as a teacher, librarian and journalist. In her first year of medical studies at the University of Sydney she suffered dermatitis from surgical soap and was told to abandon her dreams of becoming a medical doctor. Instead, she switched to neuroscience and worked at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney.\n\nIn 1963, McCullough moved for four years to the United Kingdom; at the Great Ormond Street Hospital in London she met the chairman of the neurology department at Yale University who offered her a research associate job at Yale. She spent 10 years (April 1967 to 1976) researching and teaching in the Department of Neurology at the Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. While at Yale she wrote her first two books. One of these, \"The Thorn Birds\", became an international best seller and one of the best selling books in history, with sales of over 30 million copies worldwide, that in 1983 inspired one of the most-watched television miniseries of all time.\n\nThe success of these books enabled her to give up her medical-scientific career and to try to \"live on [her] own terms.\" In the late 1970s, after stints in London and Connecticut, she settled on the isolation of Norfolk Island, off the coast of mainland Australia, where she met her husband, Ric Robinson. They married in April 1984. Under his birth name Cedric Newton Ion-Robinson, he was a member of the Norfolk Legislative Assembly. He changed his name formally to Ric Newton Ion Robinson in 2002.\n\nMcCullough's 2008 novel, \"The Independence of Miss Mary Bennet\" engendered controversy with her reworking of characters from Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\". Susannah Fullerton, the president of the Jane Austen Society of Australia, said she \"shuddered\" while reading the novel, as she felt that Elizabeth Bennet was rewritten as weak, and Mr. Darcy as savage. Fullerton said: \"[Elizabeth] is one of the strongest, liveliest heroines in literature … [and] Darcy's generosity of spirit and nobility of character make her fall in love with him – why should those essential traits in both of them change in 20 years?\"\n\nMcCullough died on 29 January 2015, at the age of 77, in the Norfolk Island Hospital from apparent renal failure after suffering from a series of small strokes. She had suffered from failing eyesight due to hemorrhagic macular degeneration, osteoporosis, trigeminal neuralgia, diabetes and uterine cancer, and was confined to a wheelchair.\n\nShe was buried in a traditional Norfolk Island funeral ceremony at the Emily Bay cemetery on the island.\n\nIn 1984, a portrait of McCullough, painted by Wesley Walters, was a finalist in the Archibald Prize. The prize is awarded for the \"best portrait painting preferentially of some man or woman distinguished in Art, Letters, Science or Politics\". The depth of historical research for the novels on ancient Rome led to her being awarded a Doctor of Letters degree by Macquarie University in 1993.\n\nShe was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia on 12 June 2006, \"[f]or service to the arts as an author and to the community through roles supporting national and international educational programs, medico-scientific disciplines and charitable organisations and causes\".\n\n\n\n\nMcCullough also published five murder mysteries in the Carmine Delmonico series.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5254", "title": "Common law", "text": "Common law\n\nIn law, common law (also known as judicial precedent or judge-made law, or case law) is that body of law derived from judicial decisions of courts and similar tribunals. The defining characteristic of “common law” is that it arises as precedent. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as \"stare decisis\"). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \"matter of first impression\"), and legislative statutes are either silent or ambiguous on the question, judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision). The court states an opinion that gives reasons for the decision, and those reasons agglomerate with past decisions as precedent to bind future judges and litigants. Common law, as the body of law made by judges, stands in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch (the interactions among these different sources of law are explained later in this article). \"Stare decisis\", the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.\n\nToday, one-third of the world's population lives in common law jurisdictions or in systems mixed with civil law, including Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Botswana, Burma, Cameroon, Canada (both the federal system and all its provinces except Quebec), Cyprus, Dominica, Fiji, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Jamaica, Kenya, Liberia, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Namibia, Nauru, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Trinidad and Tobago, the United Kingdom (including its overseas territories such as Gibraltar), the United States (both the federal system and 49 of its 50 states), and Zimbabwe. Some of these countries have variants on common law systems.\n\nThe term \"common law\" has many connotations. The first three set out here are the most-common usages within the legal community. Other connotations from past centuries are sometimes seen, and are sometimes heard in everyday speech.\n\nThe first definition of \"common law\" given in \"Black's Law Dictionary\", 10th edition, 2014, is \"The body of law derived from judicial decisions, rather than from statutes or constitutions; [synonym] CASELAW, [contrast] STATUTORY LAW.\" This usage is given as the first definition in modern legal dictionaries, is characterized as the “most common” usage among legal professionals, and is the usage frequently seen in decisions of courts. In this connotation, \"common law\" distinguishes the authority that promulgated a law. For example, the law in most Anglo-American jurisdictions includes \"statutory law\" enacted by a legislature, \"regulatory law\" (in the U.S.) or “delegated legislation” (in the U.K.) promulgated by executive branch agencies pursuant to delegation of rule-making authority from the legislature, and common law or \"case law\", \"i.e.\", decisions issued by courts (or quasi-judicial tribunals within agencies). This first connotation can be further differentiated into\nPublication of decisions, and indexing, is essential to the development of common law, and thus governments and private publishers publish law reports. While all decisions in common law jurisdictions are precedent (at varying levels and scope as discussed throughout the article on precedent), some become \"leading cases\" or \"landmark decisions\" that are cited especially often.\n\n\"Black's Law Dictionary\" 10th Ed., definition 2, differentiates \"common law\" jurisdictions and legal systems from \"civil law\" or \"code\" jurisdictions. Common law systems place great weight on court decisions, which are considered \"law\" with the same force of law as statutes—for nearly a millennium, common law courts have had the authority to make law where no legislative statute exists, and statutes mean what courts interpret them to mean.\n\nBy contrast, in civil law jurisdictions (the legal tradition that prevails, or is combined with common law, in Europe and most non-Islamic, non-common law countries), courts lack authority to act if there is no statute. Civil law judges tend to give less weight to judicial precedent, which means that a civil law judge deciding a given case has more freedom to interpret the text of a statute independently (compared to a common law judge in the same circumstances), and therefore less predictably. For example, the Napoleonic code expressly forbade French judges to pronounce general principles of law. The role of providing overarching principles, which in common law jurisdictions is provided in judicial opinions, in civil law jurisdictions is filled by giving greater weight to scholarly literature, as explained below.\n\nCommon law systems trace their history to England, while civil law systems trace their history through the Napoleonic Code back to the Corpus Juris Civilis of Roman law.\n\n\"Black's Law Dictionary\" 10th Ed., definition 4, differentiates \"common law\" (or just \"law\") from \"equity\". Before 1873, England had two complementary court systems: courts of \"law\" which could only award money damages and recognized only the legal owner of property, and courts of \"equity\" (courts of chancery) that could issue injunctive relief (that is, a court order to a party to do something, give something to someone, or stop doing something) and recognized trusts of property. This split propagated to many of the colonies, including the United States. For most purposes, most jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal system and most states, have merged the two courts. Additionally, even before the separate courts were merged, most courts were permitted to apply both law and equity, though under potentially different procedural law. Nonetheless, the historical distinction between \"law\" and \"equity\" remains important today when the case involves issues such as the following:\nCourts of equity rely on common law principles of binding precedent.\n\nIn addition, there are several historical (but now archaic) uses of the term that, while no longer current, provide background context that assists in understanding the meaning of \"common law\" today.\n\nIn one usage that is now archaic, but that gives insight into the history of the common law, \"common law\" referred to the pre-Christian system of law, imported by the Saxons to England, and dating to before the Norman conquest, and before there was any consistent law to be applied. That usage is obsolete today. It is both underinclusive and overinclusive.\n\n\"Common law\" as the term is used today in common law countries contrasts with \"ius commune\". While historically the \"ius commune\" became a secure point of reference in continental European legal systems, in England it was not a point of reference at all.\n\nThe English Court of Common Pleas dealt with lawsuits in which the Monarch had no interest, i.e., between commoners.\n\n\"Black's Law Dictionary\" 10th Ed., definition 3 is \"General law common to a country as a whole, as opposed to special law that has only local application.\" From at least the 11th century and continuing for several centuries after that, there were several different circuits in the royal court system, served by itinerant judges who would travel from town to town dispensing the King's justice in \"assizes\". The term \"common law\" was used to describe the law held in common between the circuits and the different stops in each circuit. The more widely a particular law was recognized, the more weight it held, whereas purely local customs were generally subordinate to law recognized in a plurality of jurisdictions.\n\nIn a common law jurisdiction several stages of research and analysis are required to determine \"what the law is\" in a given situation. First, one must ascertain the facts. Then, one must locate any relevant statutes and cases. Then one must extract the principles, analogies and statements by various courts of what they consider important to determine how the next court is likely to rule on the facts of the present case. Later decisions, and decisions of higher courts or legislatures carry more weight than earlier cases and those of lower courts. Finally, one integrates all the lines drawn and reasons given, and determines \"what the law is\". Then, one applies that law to the facts.\n\nIn practice, common law systems are considerably more complicated than the simplified system described above. The decisions of a court are binding only in a particular jurisdiction, and even within a given jurisdiction, some courts have more power than others. For example, in most jurisdictions, decisions by appellate courts are binding on lower courts in the same jurisdiction, and on future decisions of the same appellate court, but decisions of lower courts are only non-binding persuasive authority. Interactions between common law, constitutional law, statutory law and regulatory law also give rise to considerable complexity.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. cautioned that \"the proper derivation of general principles in both common and constitutional law ... arise gradually, in the emergence of a consensus from a multitude of particularized prior decisions.\" Justice Cardozo noted the \"common law does not work from pre-established truths of universal and inflexible validity to conclusions derived from them deductively\", but \"[i]ts method is inductive, and it draws its generalizations from particulars\".\n\nThe common law is more malleable than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, to adapt to new trends in political, legal and social philosophy. Second, the common law evolves through a series of gradual steps, that gradually works out all the details, so that over a decade or more, the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects. In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).\n\nOne example of the gradual change that typifies evolution of the common law is the gradual change in liability for negligence. The traditional common law rule through most of the 19th century was that a plaintiff could not recover for a defendant's negligent production or distribution of a harmful instrumentality unless the two were in privity of contract. Thus, only the immediate purchaser could recover for a product defect, and if a part was built up out of parts from parts manufacturers, the ultimate buyer could not recover for injury caused by a defect in the part. In an 1842 English case, \"Winterbottom v. Wright\", the postal service had contracted with Wright to maintain its coaches. Winterbottom was a driver for the post. When the coach failed and injured Winterbottom, he sued Wright. The \"Winterbottom\" court recognized that there would be \"absurd and outrageous consequences\" if an injured person could sue any person peripherally involved, and knew it had to draw a line somewhere, a limit on the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury. The court looked to the contractual relationships, and held that liability would only flow as far as the person in immediate contract (\"privity\") with the negligent party.\n\nA first exception to this rule arose in 1852, in the case of \"Thomas v. Winchester\", when New York's highest court held that mislabeling a poison as an innocuous herb, and then selling the mislabeled poison through a dealer who would be expected to resell it, put \"human life in imminent danger\". \"Thomas\" relied on this reason to create an exception to the \"privity\" rule. In, 1909, New York held in \"Statler v. Ray Mfg. Co.\" that a coffee urn manufacturer was liable to a person injured when the urn exploded, because the urn \"was of such a character inherently that, when applied to the purposes for which it was designed, it was liable to become a source of great danger to many people if not carefully and properly constructed\".\n\nYet the privity rule survived. In \"Cadillac Motor Car Co. v. Johnson\", (decided in 1915 by the federal appeals court for New York and several neighboring states), the court held that a car owner could not recover for injuries from a defective wheel, when the automobile owner had a contract only with the automobile dealer and not with the manufacturer, even though there was \"no question that the wheel was made of dead and ‘dozy‘ wood, quite insufficient for its purposes.\" The \"Cadillac\" court was willing to acknowledge that the case law supported exceptions for \"an article dangerous in its nature or likely to become so in the course of the ordinary usage to be contemplated by the vendor\". However, held the \"Cadillac\" court, \"one who manufactures articles dangerous only if defectively made, or installed, e.g., tables, chairs, pictures or mirrors hung on the walls, carriages, automobiles, and so on, is not liable to third parties for injuries caused by them, except in case of willful injury or fraud,\"\n\nFinally, in the famous case of \"MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.\", in 1916, Judge Benjamin Cardozo for New York's highest court pulled a broader principle out of these predecessor cases. The facts were almost identical to \"Cadillac\" a year earlier: a wheel from a wheel manufacturer was sold to Buick, to a dealer, to MacPherson, and the wheel failed, injuring MacPherson. Judge Cardozo held:\n\nCardozo's new \"rule\" exists in no prior case, but is inferrable as a synthesis of the \"thing of danger\" principle stated in them, merely extending it to \"foreseeable danger\" even if \"the purposes for which it was designed\" were not themselves \"a source of great danger\". \"MacPherson\" takes some care to present itself as foreseeable progression, not a wild departure. Cardozo continues to adhere to the original principle of \"Winterbottom\", that \"absurd and outrageous consequences\" must be avoided, and he does so by drawing a new line in the last sentence quoted above: \"There must be knowledge of a danger, not merely possible, but probable.\" But while adhering to the underlying principle that \"some\" boundary is necessary, \"MacPherson\" overruled the prior common law by rendering the formerly dominant factor in the boundary, that is, the privity formality arising out of a contractual relationship between persons, totally irrelevant. Rather, the most important factor in the boundary would be the nature of the thing sold and the foreseeable uses that downstream purchasers would make of the thing.\n\nThe example of the evolution of the law of negligence in the preceding paragraphs illustrates two crucial principles: (a) The common law evolves, this evolution is in the hands of judges, and judges have \"made law\" for hundreds of years. (b) The reasons given for a decision are often more important in the long run than the outcome in a particular case. This is the reason that judicial opinions are usually quite long, and give rationales and policies that can be balanced with judgment in future cases, rather than the bright-line rules usually embodied in statutes.\n\nAll law systems rely on written publication of the law, so that it is accessible to all. Common law decisions are published in law reports for use by lawyers, courts and the general public.\n\nAfter the American Revolution, Massachusetts became the first state to establish an official Reporter of Decisions. As newer states needed law, they often looked first to the Massachusetts Reports for authoritative precedents as a basis for their own common law. The United States federal courts relied on private publishers until after the Civil War, and only began publishing as a government function in 1874. West Publishing in Minnesota is the largest private-sector publisher of law reports in the United States. Government publishers typically issue only decisions \"in the raw,\" while private sector publishers often add indexing, editorial analysis, and similar finding aids.\n\nIn common law legal systems, the common law is crucial to understanding almost all important areas of law. For example, in England and Wales, in English Canada, and in most states of the United States, the basic law of contracts, torts and property do not exist in statute, but only in common law (though there may be isolated modifications enacted by statute). As another example, the Supreme Court of the United States in 1877, held that a Michigan statute that established rules for solemnization of marriages did not abolish pre-existing common-law marriage, because the statute did not affirmatively require statutory solemnization and was silent as to preexisting common law.\n\nIn almost all areas of the law (even those where there is a statutory framework, such as contracts for the sale of goods, or the criminal law), legislature-enacted statutes generally give only terse statements of general principle, and the fine boundaries and definitions exist only in the interstitial common law. To find out what the precise law is that applies to a particular set of facts, one has to locate precedential decisions on the topic, and reason from those decisions by analogy.\n\nIn (common law jurisdictions (in the sense opposed to \"civil law\"), legislatures operate under the assumption that statutes will be interpreted against the backdrop of the pre-existing common law. As the United States Supreme Court explained in \"United States v Texas\", 507 U.S. 529 (1993):\n\nFor example, in most U.S. states, the criminal statutes are primarily codification of pre-existing common law. (Codification is the process of enacting a statute that collects and restates pre-existing law in a single document—when that pre-existing law is common law, the common law remains relevant to the interpretation of these statutes.) In reliance on this assumption, modern statutes often leave a number of terms and fine distinctions unstated—for example, a statute might be very brief, leaving the precise definition of terms unstated, under the assumption that these fine distinctions will be inherited from pre-existing common law. (For this reason, many modern American law schools teach the common law of crime as it stood in England in 1789, because that centuries-old English common law is a necessary foundation to interpreting modern criminal statutes.)\n\nWith the transition from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the U.S. Constitution, which prohibited \"ex post facto\" laws at both the federal and state level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of \"United States v. Hudson\", which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must always be a (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.\n\nStill, many states retain selected common law crimes. For example, in Virginia, the definition of the conduct that constitutes the crime of robbery exists only in the common law, and the robbery statute only sets the punishment. Virginia Code section 1-200 establishes the continued existence and vitality of common law principles and provides that \"The common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly.\"\n\nBy contrast to statutory codification of common law, some statutes displace common law, for example to create a new cause of action that did not exist in the common law, or to legislatively overrule the common law. An example is the tort of wrongful death, which allows certain persons, usually a spouse, child or estate, to sue for damages on behalf of the deceased. There is no such tort in English common law; thus, any jurisdiction that lacks a wrongful death statute will not allow a lawsuit for the wrongful death of a loved one. Where a wrongful death statute exists, the compensation or other remedy available is limited to the remedy specified in the statute (typically, an upper limit on the amount of damages). Courts generally interpret statutes that create new causes of action narrowly—that is, limited to their precise terms—because the courts generally recognize the legislature as being supreme in deciding the reach of judge-made law unless such statute should violate some \"second order\" constitutional law provision (\"cf\". judicial activism).\n\nWhere a tort is rooted in common law, all traditionally recognized damages for that tort may be sued for, whether or not there is mention of those damages in the current statutory law. For instance, a person who sustains bodily injury through the negligence of another may sue for medical costs, pain, suffering, loss of earnings or earning capacity, mental and/or emotional distress, loss of quality of life, disfigurement and more. These damages need not be set forth in statute as they already exist in the tradition of common law. However, without a wrongful death statute, most of them are extinguished upon death.\n\nIn the United States, the power of the federal judiciary to review and invalidate unconstitutional acts of the federal executive branch is stated in the constitution, Article III sections 1 and 2: \"The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. ... The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority...\" The first landmark decision on \"the judicial power\" was \"Marbury v. Madison\", . Later cases interpreted the \"judicial power\" of Article III to establish the power of federal courts to consider or overturn any action of Congress or of any state that conflicts with the Constitution.\n\nThe interactions between decisions of different courts is discussed further in the article on precedent.\n\nThe United States federal courts are divided into twelve regional circuits, each with a circuit court of appeals (plus a thirteenth, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals in patent cases and cases against the federal government, without geographic limitation). Decisions of one circuit court are binding on the district courts within the circuit and on the circuit court itself, but are only persuasive authority on sister circuits. District court decisions are not binding precedent at all, only persuasive.\n\nMost of the U.S. federal courts of appeal have adopted a rule under which, in the event of any conflict in decisions of panels (most of the courts of appeal almost always sit in panels of three), the earlier panel decision is controlling, and a panel decision may only be overruled by the court of appeals sitting \"en banc\" (that is, all active judges of the court) or by a higher court. In these courts, the older decision remains controlling when an issue comes up the third time.\n\nOther courts, for example, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Supreme Court, always sit \"en banc\", and thus the \"later\" decision controls. These courts essentially overrule all previous cases in each new case, and older cases survive only to the extent they do not conflict with newer cases. The interpretations of these courts—for example, Supreme Court interpretations of the constitution or federal statutes—are stable only so long as the older interpretation maintains the support of a majority of the court. Older decisions persist through some combination of belief that the old decision is right, and that it is not sufficiently wrong to be overruled.\n\nIn the jurisdictions of England and Wales and of Northern Ireland, since 2009, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has the authority to overrule and unify criminal law decisions of lower courts; it is the final court of appeal for civil law cases in all three of the UK jurisdictions but not for criminal law cases in Scotland. From 1966 to 2009, this power lay with the House of Lords, granted by the Practice Statement of 1966.\n\nCanada's federal system, described below, avoids regional variability of federal law by giving national jurisdiction to both layers of appellate courts.\n\nThe reliance on judicial opinion is a strength of common law systems, and is a significant contributor to the robust commercial systems in the United Kingdom and United States. Because there is reasonably precise guidance on almost every issue, parties (especially commercial parties) can predict whether a proposed course of action is likely to be lawful or unlawful, and have some assurance of consistency. As Justice Brandeis famously expressed it, \"in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\" This ability to predict gives more freedom to come close to the boundaries of the law. For example, many commercial contracts are more economically efficient, and create greater wealth, because the parties know ahead of time that the proposed arrangement, though perhaps close to the line, is almost certainly legal. Newspapers, taxpayer-funded entities with some religious affiliation, and political parties can obtain fairly clear guidance on the boundaries within which their freedom of expression rights apply.\n\nIn contrast, in jurisdictions with very weak respect for precedent, fine questions of law are redetermined anew each time they arise, making consistency and prediction more difficult, and procedures far more protracted than necessary because parties cannot rely on written statements of law as reliable guides. In jurisdictions that do not have a strong allegiance to a large body of precedent, parties have less \"a priori\" guidance (unless the written law is very clear and kept updated) and must often leave a bigger \"safety margin\" of unexploited opportunities, and final determinations are reached only after far larger expenditures on legal fees by the parties.\n\nThis is the reason for the frequent choice of the law of the State of New York in commercial contracts, even when neither entity has extensive contacts with New York—and remarkably often even when neither party has contacts with the United States. Commercial contracts almost always include a \"choice of law clause\" to reduce uncertainty. Somewhat surprisingly, contracts throughout the world (for example, contracts involving parties in Japan, France and Germany, and from most of the other states of the United States) often choose the law of New York, even where the relationship of the parties and transaction to New York is quite attenuated. Because of its history as the United States' commercial center, New York common law has a depth and predictability not (yet) available in any other jurisdictions of the United States. Similarly, American corporations are often formed under Delaware corporate law, and American contracts relating to corporate law issues (merger and acquisitions of companies, rights of shareholders, and so on.) include a Delaware choice of law clause, because of the deep body of law in Delaware on these issues. On the other hand, some other jurisdictions have sufficiently developed bodies of law so that parties have no real motivation to choose the law of a foreign jurisdiction (for example, England and Wales, and the state of California), but not yet so fully developed that parties with no relationship to the jurisdiction choose that law. Outside the United States, parties that are in different jurisdictions from each other often choose the law of England and Wales, particularly when the parties are each in former British colonies and members of the Commonwealth. The common theme in all cases is that commercial parties seek predictability and simplicity in their contractual relations, and frequently choose the law of a common law jurisdiction with a well-developed body of common law to achieve that result.\n\nLikewise, for litigation of commercial disputes arising out of unpredictable torts (as opposed to the prospective choice of law clauses in contracts discussed in the previous paragraph), certain jurisdictions attract an unusually high fraction of cases, because of the predictability afforded by the depth of decided cases. For example, London is considered the pre-eminent centre for litigation of admiralty cases.\n\nThis is not to say that common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the legislature has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that tends to make the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example).\n\nThe common lawso named because it was \"common\" to all the king's courts across Englandoriginated in the practices of the courts of the English kings in the centuries following the Norman Conquest in 1066. Prior to the Norman Conquest, much of England's legal business took place in the local folk courts of its various shires and hundreds. A variety of other individual courts also existed across the land: urban boroughs and merchant fairs held their own courts, as did the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and large landholders also held their own manorial and seigniorial courts as needed. Additionally, the Catholic Church operated its own court system that adjudicated issues of canon law.\n\nThe main sources for the history of the common law in the Middle Ages are the plea rolls and the Year Books. The plea rolls, which were the official court records for the Courts of Common Pleas and King's Bench, were written in Latin. The rolls were made up in bundles by law term: Hilary, Easter, Trinity, and Michaelmas, or winter, spring, summer, and autumn. They are currently deposited in the UK National Archives, by whose permission images of the rolls for the Courts of Common Pleas, King's Bench, and Exchequer of Pleas, from the 13th century to the 17th, can be viewed online at the Anglo-American Legal Tradition site (The O'Quinn Law Library of the University of Houston Law Center).\n\nThe doctrine of precedent developed during the 12th and 13th centuries, as the collective judicial decisions that were based in tradition, custom and precedent.\n\nThe form of reasoning used in common law is known as casuistry or case-based reasoning. The common law, as applied in civil cases (as distinct from criminal cases), was devised as a means of compensating someone for wrongful acts known as torts, including both intentional torts and torts caused by negligence, and as developing the body of law recognizing and regulating contracts. The type of procedure practiced in common law courts is known as the adversarial system; this is also a development of the common law.\n\nThe early development of case-law in the thirteenth century has been traced to Bracton's \"On the Laws and Customs of England\" and led to the yearly compilations of court cases known as Year Books, of which the first extant was published in 1268, the same year that Bracton died. The Year Books are known as the law reports of medieval England, and are a principal source for knowledge of the developing legal doctrines, concepts, and methods in the period from the 13th to the 16th centuries, when the common law developed into recognizable form.\nIn 1154, Henry II became the first Plantagenet king. Among many achievements, Henry institutionalized common law by creating a unified system of law \"common\" to the country through incorporating and elevating local custom to the national, ending local control and peculiarities, eliminating arbitrary remedies and reinstating a jury system—citizens sworn on oath to investigate reliable criminal accusations and civil claims. The jury reached its verdict through evaluating common local knowledge, not necessarily through the presentation of evidence, a distinguishing factor from today's civil and criminal court systems.\n\nHenry II developed the practice of sending judges from his own central court to hear the various disputes throughout the country. His judges would resolve disputes on an ad hoc basis according to what they interpreted the customs to be. The king's judges would then return to London and often discuss their cases and the decisions they made with the other judges. These decisions would be recorded and filed. In time, a rule, known as \"stare decisis\" (also commonly known as precedent) developed, whereby a judge would be bound to follow the decision of an earlier judge; he was required to adopt the earlier judge's interpretation of the law and apply the same principles promulgated by that earlier judge if the two cases had similar facts to one another. Once judges began to regard each other's decisions to be binding precedent, the pre-Norman system of local customs and law varying in each locality was replaced by a system that was (at least in theory, though not always in practice) common throughout the whole country, hence the name \"common law\".\n\nHenry II's creation of a powerful and unified court system, which curbed somewhat the power of canonical (church) courts, brought him (and England) into conflict with the church, most famously with Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The murder of the Archbishop gave rise to a wave of popular outrage against the King. Henry was forced to repeal the disputed laws and to abandon his efforts to hold church members accountable for secular crimes (see also Constitutions of Clarendon).\n\nThe English Court of Common Pleas was established after Magna Carta to try lawsuits between commoners in which the monarch had no interest. Its judges sat in open court in the Great Hall of the king's Palace of Westminster, permanently except in the vacations between the four terms of the Legal year.\n\nJudge-made common law operated as the primary source of law for several hundred years, before Parliament acquired legislative powers to create statutory law. It is important to understand that common law is the older and more traditional source of law, and legislative power is simply a layer applied on top of the older common law foundation. Since the 12th century, courts have had parallel and co-equal authority to make law—\"legislating from the bench\" is a traditional and essential function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the \"judicial power\" specified by Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. summarized centuries of history in 1917, \"judges do and must legislate.\" There are legitimate debates on how the powers of courts and legislatures should be balanced. However, the view that courts lack law-making power is historically inaccurate and constitutionally unsupportable.\n\nIn England, judges have devised a number of rules as to how to deal with precedent decisions.\n\nThe term \"common law\" is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived \"civil law\", and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.\n\nBy the time of the rediscovery of the Roman law in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent. However, the first common law scholars, most notably Glanvill and Bracton, as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law. One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton's \"De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae\" (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian's \"Institutes\". The impact of Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into \"in rem\" (typically, actions against a \"thing\" or property for the purpose of gaining title to that property; must be filed in a court where the property is located) and \"in personam\" (typically, actions directed against a person; these can affect a person's rights and, since a person often owns things, his property too) used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century. As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent unjust enrichment) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.\n\nThe first attempt at a comprehensive compilation of centuries of common law was by Lord Chief Justice Edward Coke, in his treatise, \"Institutes of the Lawes of England\" in the 17th century.\n\nThe next definitive historical treatise on the common law is \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", written by Sir William Blackstone and first published in 1765–1769.\n\nA reception statute is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent, by which the new nation adopts (i.e. receives) pre-independence common law, to the extent not explicitly rejected by the legislative body or constitution of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, and the precedent originating from it, as the default law, because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state. All U.S. states, with the partial exception of Louisiana, have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the common law by judicial opinion.\n\nOther examples of reception statutes in the United States, the states of the U.S., Canada and its provinces, and Hong Kong, are discussed in the reception statute article.\n\nYet, adoption of the common law in the newly-independent nation was not a foregone conclusion, and was controversial. Immediately after the American Revolution, there was widespread distrust and hostility to anything British, and the common law was no exception. Jeffersonians decried lawyers and their common law tradition as threats to the new republic. The Jeffersonians preferred a legislatively-enacted civil law under the control of the political process, rather than the common law developed by judges that—by design—were insulated from the political process. The Federalists believed that the common law was the birthright of Independence: after all, the natural rights to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" were the rights protected by common law. Even advocates for the common law approach noted that it was not an ideal fit for the newly-independent colonies: judges and lawyers alike were severely hindered by a lack of printed legal materials. Before Independence, the most comprehensive law libraries had been maintained by Tory lawyers, and those libraries vanished with the loyalist expatriation, and the ability to print books was limited. Lawyer (later president) John Adams complained that he \"suffered very much for the want of books\". To bootstrap this most basic need of a common law system—knowable, written law—in 1803, lawyers in Massachusetts donated their books to found a law library. A Jeffersonian newspaper criticized the library, as it would carry forward \"all the old authorities practiced in England for centuries back ... whereby a new system of jurisprudence [will be founded] on the high monarchical system [to] become the Common Law of this Commonwealth... [The library] may hereafter have a very unsocial purpose.\"\n\nWell into the 19th century, ancient maxims played a large role in common law adjudication. Many of these maxims had originated in Roman Law, migrated to England before the introduction of Christianity to the British Isles, and were typically stated in Latin even in English decisions. Many examples are familiar in everyday speech even today, \"One cannot be a judge in one's own cause\" (see Dr. Bonham's Case), rights are reciprocal to obligations, and the like. Judicial decisions and treatises of the 17th and 18th centuries, such at those of Lord Chief Justice Edward Coke, presented the common law as a collection of such maxims.\n\nReliance on old maxims and rigid adherence to precedent, no matter how old or ill-considered, came under critical discussion in the late 19th century, starting in the United States. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in his famous article, \"The Path of the Law\", commented, \"It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.\" Justice Holmes noted that study of maxims might be sufficient for \"the man of the present\", but \"the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics\". In an 1880 lecture at Harvard, he wrote:\n\nThe life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience. The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Louis Brandeis, later appointed to the United States Supreme Court, became noted for his use of policy-driving facts and economics in his briefs, and extensive appendices presenting facts that lead a judge to the advocate's conclusion. By this time, briefs relied more on facts than on Latin maxims.\n\nReliance on old maxims is now deprecated. Common law decisions today reflect both precedent and policy judgment drawn from economics, the social sciences, business, decisions of foreign courts, and the like. The degree to which these external factors \"should\" influence adjudication is the subject of active debate, but it is indisputable that judges \"do\" draw on experience and learning from everyday life, from other fields, and from other jurisdictions.\n\nAs early as the 15th century, it became the practice that litigants who felt they had been cheated by the common law system would petition the King in person. For example, they might argue that an award of damages (at common law (as opposed to equity)) was not sufficient redress for a trespasser occupying their land, and instead request that the trespasser be evicted. From this developed the system of equity, administered by the Lord Chancellor, in the courts of chancery. By their nature, equity and law were frequently in conflict and litigation would frequently continue for years as one court countermanded the other, even though it was established by the 17th century that equity should prevail.\n\nIn England, courts of law (as opposed to equity) were combined with courts of equity by the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875, with equity prevailing in case of conflict.\n\nIn the United States, parallel systems of law (providing money damages, with cases heard by a jury upon either party's request) and equity (fashioning a remedy to fit the situation, including injunctive relief, heard by a judge) survived well into the 20th century. The United States federal courts procedurally separated law and equity: the same judges could hear either kind of case, but a given case could only pursue causes in law or in equity, and the two kinds of cases proceeded under different procedural rules. This became problematic when a given case required both money damages and injunctive relief. In 1937, the new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure combined law and equity into one form of action, the \"civil action\". Fed.R.Civ.P. . The distinction survives to the extent that issues that were \"common law (as opposed to equity)\" as of 1791 (the date of adoption of the Seventh Amendment) are still subject to the right of either party to request a jury, and \"equity\" issues are decided by a judge.\n\nDelaware, Mississippi, and Tennessee still have separate courts of law and equity, for example, the Court of Chancery. In many states there are separate divisions for law and equity within one court.\n\nFor centuries, through the 19th century, the common law recognized only specific forms of action, and required very careful drafting of the opening pleading (called a writ) to slot into exactly one of them: Debt, Detinue, Covenant, Special Assumpsit, General Assumpsit, Trespass, Trover, Replevin, Case (or Trespass on the Case), and Ejectment. To initiate a lawsuit, a pleading had to be drafted to meet myriad technical requirements: correctly categorizing the case into the correct legal pigeonhole (pleading in the alternative was not permitted), and using specific \"magic words\" encrusted over the centuries. Under the old common law pleading standards, a suit by a \"pro se\" (\"for oneself,\" without a lawyer) party was all but impossible, and there was often considerable procedural jousting at the outset of a case over minor wording issues.\n\nOne of the major reforms of the late 19th century and early 20th century was the abolition of common law pleading requirements. A plaintiff can initiate a case by giving the defendant \"a short and plain statement\" of facts that constitute an alleged wrong. This reform moved the attention of courts from technical scrutiny of words to a more rational consideration of the facts, and opened access to justice far more broadly.\n\nThe main alternative to the common law system is the civil law system, which is used in Continental Europe, and most of the rest of the world.\n\nThe primary contrast between the two systems is the role of written decisions and precedent.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, nearly every case that presents a \"bona fide\" disagreement on the law is resolved in a written opinion. The legal reasoning for the decision, known as \"ratio decidendi\", not only determines the court's judgment between the parties, but also stands as precedent for resolving future disputes. In contrast, civil law decisions typically do not include explanatory opinions, and thus no precedent flows from one decision to the next.\nIn common law systems, a single decided case is binding common law (connotation 1) to the same extent as statute or regulation, under the principle of \"stare decisis\". In contrast, in civil law systems, individual decisions have only advisory, not binding effect. In civil law systems, case law only acquires weight when a long series of cases use consistent reasoning, called \"jurisprudence constante\". Civil law lawyers consult case law to obtain their best prediction of how a court will rule, but comparatively, civil law judges are less bound to follow it.\n\nFor that reason, statutes in civil law systems are more comprehensive, detailed, and continuously updated, covering all matters capable of being brought before a court.\n\nCommon law systems tend to give more weight to separation of powers between the judicial branch and the executive branch. In contrast, civil law systems are typically more tolerant of allowing individual officials to exercise both powers. One example of this contrast is the difference between the two systems in allocation of responsibility between prosecutor and adjudicator.\n\nCommon law courts usually use an adversarial system, in which two sides present their cases to a neutral judge. In contrast, in civil law systems, criminal proceedings proceed under an inquisitorial system in which an examining magistrate serves two roles by developing the evidence and arguments for one side and then the other during the investigation phase.\n\nThe examining magistrate then presents the dossier detailing his or her findings to the president of the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.\n\nThe proceeding in the inquisitorial system is essentially by writing. Most of the witnesses would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but he or she will be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads guilty or not, a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together with the president of the trial bench, following their common deliberation.\n\nThere are many exceptions in both directions. For example, most proceedings before U.S. federal and state agencies are inquisitorial in nature, at least the initial stages (\"e.g.\", a patent examiner, a social security hearing officer, and so on), even though the law to be applied is developed through common law processes.\n\nThe role of the legal academy presents a significant \"cultural\" difference between common law (connotation 2) and civil law jurisdictions. In both systems, treatises compile decisions and state overarching principles that (in the author's opinion) explain the results of the cases. In neither system are treatises considered \"law,\" but the weight given them is nonetheless quite different.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, lawyers and judges tend to use these treatises as only \"finding aids\" to locate the relevant cases. In common law jurisdictions, scholarly work is seldom cited as authority for what the law is. Chief Justice Roberts noted the \"great disconnect between the academy and the profession.\" When common law courts rely on scholarly work, it is almost always only for factual findings, policy justification, or the history and evolution of the law, but the court's legal conclusion is reached through analysis of relevant statutes and common law, seldom scholarly commentary.\n\nIn contrast, in civil law jurisdictions, courts give the writings of law professors significant weight, partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes no more than a paragraph stating who wins and who loses. The rationale had to come from somewhere else: the academy often filled that role.\n\nThe contrast between civil law and common law legal systems has become increasingly blurred, with the growing importance of jurisprudence (similar to case law but not binding) in civil law countries, and the growing importance of statute law and codes in common law countries.\n\nExamples of common law being replaced by statute or codified rule in the United States include criminal law (since 1812, U.S. federal courts and most but not all of the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), commercial law (the Uniform Commercial Code in the early 1960s) and procedure (the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the 1930s and the Federal Rules of Evidence in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the interstitial common law process determines the scope and application of the statute.\n\nAn example of convergence from the other direction is shown in the 1982 decision \"Srl CILFIT and Lanificio di Gavardo SpA v Ministry of Health\" (), in which the European Court of Justice held that questions it has already answered need not be resubmitted. This showed how a historically distinctly common law principle is used by a court composed of judges (at that time) of essentially civil law jurisdiction.\n\nThe former Soviet Bloc and other Socialist countries used a Socialist law system.\n\nMuch of the Muslim world uses Sharia (also called Islamic law).\n\nThe common law constitutes the basis of the legal systems of:\n\nand many other generally English-speaking countries or Commonwealth countries (except the UK's Scotland, which is bijuridicial, and Malta). Essentially, every country that was colonised at some time by England, Great Britain, or the United Kingdom uses common law except those that were formerly colonised by other nations, such as Quebec (which follows the law of France in part), South Africa and Sri Lanka (which follow Roman Dutch law), where the prior civil law system was retained to respect the civil rights of the local colonists. Guyana and Saint Lucia have mixed Common Law and Civil Law systems.\n\nThe remainder of this section discusses jurisdiction-specific variants, arranged chronologically.\n\nScotland is often said to use the civil law system, but it has a unique system that combines elements of an uncodified civil law dating back to the Corpus Juris Civilis with an element of its own common law long predating the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 (see Legal institutions of Scotland in the High Middle Ages), founded on the customary laws of the tribes residing there. Historically, Scottish common law differed in that the use of \"precedent\" was subject to the courts' seeking to discover the principle that justifies a law rather than searching for an example as a \"precedent\", and principles of natural justice and fairness have always played a role in Scots Law. From the 19th century, the Scottish approach to precedent developed into a \"stare decisis\" akin to that already established in England thereby reflecting a narrower, more modern approach to the application of case law in subsequent instances. This is not to say that the substantive rules of the common laws of both countries are the same although in many matters (particularly those of UK-wide interest) they are similar.\n\nScotland shares the Supreme Court, with England, Wales and Northern Ireland for civil cases; the court's decisions are binding on the jurisdiction from which a case arises but only influential on similar cases arising in Scotland. This has had the effect of converging the law in certain areas. For instance, the modern UK law of negligence is based on \"Donoghue v Stevenson\", a case originating in Paisley, Scotland.\n\nScotland maintains a separate criminal law system from the rest of the UK, with the High Court of Justiciary being the final court for criminal appeals. The highest court of appeal in civil cases brought in Scotland is now the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (before October 2009, final appellate jurisdiction lay with the House of Lords).\n\nThe centuries-old authority of the common law courts in England to develop law case by case and to apply statute law—\"legislating from the bench\"— is a traditional function of courts, which was carried over into the U.S. system as an essential component of the \"judicial power\" specified by Article III of the U.S. constitution. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. summarized centuries of history in 1917, \"judges do and must legislate” (in the federal courts, only interstitially, in state courts, to the full limits of common law adjudicatory authority).\n\nThe state of New York, which also has a civil law history from its Dutch colonial days, began a codification of its law in the 19th century. The only part of this codification process that was considered complete is known as the Field Code applying to civil procedure. The original colony of New Netherland was settled by the Dutch and the law was also Dutch. When the English captured pre-existing colonies they continued to allow the local settlers to keep their civil law. However, the Dutch settlers revolted against the English and the colony was recaptured by the Dutch. When the English finally regained control of New Netherland they forced, as a punishment unique in the history of the British Empire, the English imposed common law upon all the colonists, including the Dutch. This was problematic, as the patroon system of land holding, based on the feudal system and civil law, continued to operate in the colony until it was abolished in the mid-19th century. The influence of Roman-Dutch law continued in the colony well into the late 19th century. The codification of a law of general obligations shows how remnants of the civil law tradition in New York continued on from the Dutch days.\n\nUnder Louisiana's codified system, the Louisiana Civil Code, private law—that is, substantive law between private sector parties—is based on principles of law from continental Europe, with some common law influences. These principles derive ultimately from Roman law, transmitted through French law and Spanish law, as the state's current territory intersects the area of North America colonized by Spain and by France. Contrary to popular belief, the Louisiana code does not directly derive from the Napoleonic Code, as the latter was enacted in 1804, one year after the Louisiana Purchase. However, the two codes are similar in many respects due to common roots.\n\nLouisiana's criminal law largely rests on English common law. Louisiana's administrative law is generally similar to the administrative law of the U.S. federal government and other U.S. states. Louisiana's procedural law is generally in line with that of other U.S. states, which in turn is generally based on the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nHistorically notable among the Louisiana code's differences from common law is the role of property rights among women, particularly in inheritance gained by widows.\n\nThe U.S. state of California has a system based on common law, but it has codified the law in the manner of the civil law jurisdictions. The reason for the enactment of the California Codes in the 19th century was to replace a pre-existing system based on Spanish civil law with a system based on common law, similar to that in most other states. California and a number of other Western states, however, have retained the concept of community property derived from civil law. The California courts have treated portions of the codes as an extension of the common-law tradition, subject to judicial development in the same manner as judge-made common law. (Most notably, in the case \"Li v. Yellow Cab Co.\", 13 Cal.3d 804 (1975), the California Supreme Court adopted the principle of comparative negligence in the face of a California Civil Code provision codifying the traditional common-law doctrine of contributory negligence.)\n\nThe United States federal government (as opposed to the states) has a variant on a common law system. United States federal courts only act as interpreters of statutes and the constitution by elaborating and precisely defining broad statutory language (connotation 1(b) above), but, unlike state courts, do not act as an independent source of common law.\n\nBefore 1938, the federal courts, like almost all other common law courts, decided the law on any issue where the relevant legislature (either the U.S. Congress or state legislature, depending on the issue), had not acted, by looking to courts in the same system, that is, other federal courts, even on issues of state law, and even where there was no express grant of authority from Congress or the Constitution.\n\nIn 1938, the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins\" 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938), overruled earlier precedent, and held \"There is no federal general common law,\" thus confining the federal courts to act only as interpreters of law originating elsewhere. \"E.g.\", \"Texas Industries v. Radcliff\", (without an express grant of statutory authority, federal courts cannot create rules of intuitive justice, for example, a right to contribution from co-conspirators). Post-1938, federal courts deciding issues that arise under state law are required to defer to state court interpretations of state statutes, or reason what a state's highest court would rule if presented with the issue, or to certify the question to the state's highest court for resolution.\n\nLater courts have limited \"Erie\" slightly, to create a few situations where United States federal courts are permitted to create federal common law rules without express statutory authority, for example, where a federal rule of decision is necessary to protect uniquely federal interests, such as foreign affairs, or financial instruments issued by the federal government. \"See, e.g.\", \"Clearfield Trust Co. v. United States\", (giving federal courts the authority to fashion common law rules with respect to issues of federal power, in this case negotiable instruments backed by the federal government); \"see also\" \"International News Service v. Associated Press\", 248 U.S. 215 (1918) (creating a cause of action for misappropriation of \"hot news\" that lacks any statutory grounding); \"but see National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc.\", 105 F.3d 841, 843–44, 853 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting continued vitality of \"INS\" \"hot news\" tort under New York state law, but leaving open the question of whether it survives under federal law). Except on Constitutional issues, Congress is free to legislatively overrule federal courts' common law.\n\nMost executive branch agencies in the United States federal government have some adjudicatory authority. To greater or lesser extent, agencies honor their own precedent to ensure consistent results. Agency decision making is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946.\n\nFor example, the National Labor Relations Board issues relatively few regulations, but instead promulgates most of its substantive rules through common law (connotation 1).\n\nThe law of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are largely based on English common law because of the long period of British colonial influence during the period of the British Raj.\n\nAncient India represented a distinct tradition of law, and had an historically independent school of legal theory and practice. The \"Arthashastra\", dating from 400 BCE and the \"Manusmriti\", from 100 CE, were influential treatises in India, texts that were considered authoritative legal guidance. Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism, and was cited across Southeast Asia. Early in this period, which finally culminated in the creation of the Gupta Empire, relations with ancient Greece and Rome were not infrequent. The appearance of similar fundamental institutions of international law in various parts of the world show that they are inherent in international society, irrespective of culture and tradition. Inter-State relations in the pre-Islamic period resulted in clear-cut rules of warfare of a high humanitarian standard, in rules of neutrality, of treaty law, of customary law embodied in religious charters, in exchange of embassies of a temporary or semi-permanent character.\n\nWhen India became part of the British Empire, there was a break in tradition, and Hindu and Islamic law were supplanted by the common law. After the failed rebellion against the British in 1857, the British Parliament took over control of India from the British East India Company, and British India came under the direct rule of the Crown. The British Parliament passed the Government of India Act of 1858 to this effect, which set up the structure of British government in India. It established in Britain the office of the Secretary of State for India through whom the Parliament would exercise its rule, along with a Council of India to aid him. It also established the office of the Governor-General of India along with an Executive Council in India, which consisted of high officials of the British Government. As a result, the present judicial system of the country derives largely from the British system and has little correlation to the institutions of the pre-British era.\n\nPost-partition, India retained its common law system. Much of contemporary Indian law shows substantial European and American influence. Legislation first introduced by the British is still in effect in modified form today. During the drafting of the Indian Constitution, laws from Ireland, the United States, Britain, and France were all synthesized to produce a refined set of Indian laws. Indian laws also adhere to the United Nations guidelines on human rights law and environmental law. Certain international trade laws, such as those on intellectual property, are also enforced in India.\n\nThe exception to this rule is in the state of Goa, annexed in stages in the 1960s through 1980s. In Goa, a Portuguese uniform civil code is in place, in which all religions have a common law regarding marriages, divorces and adoption.\n\nPost-partition, Pakistan retained its common law system.\n\nPost-partition, Bangladesh retained its common law system.\n\nCanada has separate federal and provincial legal systems. The division of jurisdiction between the federal and provincial Parliaments is specified in the Canadian constitution.\n\nEach province and territory is considered a separate jurisdiction with respect to common law matters. As such, only the provincial legislature may enact legislation to amend private law. Each has its own procedural law, statutorily created provincial courts and superior trial courts with inherent jurisdiction culminating in the Court of Appeal of the province. This is the highest court in provincial jurisdiction, only subject to the Supreme Court of Canada in terms of appeal of their decisions. All but one of the provinces of Canada use a common law system (the exception being Quebec, which uses a French-heritage civil law system for issues arising within provincial jurisdiction, such as property ownership and contracts).\n\nCanadian Federal Courts operate under a separate system throughout Canada and deal with narrower subject matter than superior courts in provincial jurisdiction. They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution, such as immigration, intellectual property, judicial review of federal government decisions, and admiralty. The Federal Court of Appeal is the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities, and unlike the United States, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal is not divided into appellate circuits.\n\nCriminal law is uniform throughout Canada. It is based on the constitution and federal statutory Criminal Code, as interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada. The administration of justice and enforcement of the criminal code are the responsibilities of the provinces.\n\nCanadian federal statutes must use the terminology of both the common law and civil law for those matters; this is referred to as legislative bijuralism.\n\nNicaragua's legal system is also a mixture of the English Common Law and Civil Law. This situation was brought through the influence of British administration of the Eastern half of the Mosquito Coast from the mid-17th century until about 1894, the William Walker period from about 1855 through 1857, USA interventions/occupations during the period from 1909 to 1933, the influence of USA institutions during the Somoza family administrations (1933 through 1979) and the considerable importation between 1979 and the present of USA culture and institutions.\n\nIsrael has a common law legal system. Its basic principles are inherited from the law of the British Mandate of Palestine and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the supreme court in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the Israeli constitution remains unwritten is the fear by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the Knesset (which, following the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, holds near-unlimited power).\n\nRoman Dutch Common law is a bijuridical or mixed system of law similar to the common law system in Scotland and Louisiana. Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions include South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, Sri-Lanka and Zimbabwe. Many of these jurisdictions recognise customary law, and in some, such as South Africa the Constitution requires that the common law be developed in accordance with the Bill of Rights. Roman Dutch common law is a development of Roman Dutch law by courts in the Roman Dutch common law jurisdictions. During the Napoleonic wars the Kingdom of the Netherlands adopted the French \"code civil\" in 1809, however the Dutch colonies in the Cape of Good Hope and Sri Lanka, at the time called Ceylon, were seized by the British to prevent them being used as bases by the French Navy. The system was developed by the courts and spread with the expansion of British colonies in Southern Africa. Roman Dutch common law relies on legal principles set out in Roman law sources such as Justinian's Institutes and Digest, and also on the writing of Dutch jurists of the 17th century such as Grotius and Voet. In practice, the majority of decisions rely on recent precedent.\n\nGhana follows the English common-law tradition which was inherited from the British during her colonisation. Consequently, the laws of Ghana are, for the most part, a modified version of imported law that is continuously adapting to changing socio-economic and political realities of the country. The Bond of 184 4 was the first most important event in the history of Ghana (then Gold Coast) that marked the critical period when the people ceded their independence to the British and gave the British judicial authority. Later, the Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876 “formally” introduced British law, be it the common law or statutory law, in the Gold Coast. Section 14 of the Ordinance formalised the application of the common-law tradition in the country.\n\nGhana, after independence, did not do away with the common law system inherited from the British, and today it has been enshrined in the 1992 Constitution of the country. Chapter four of Ghana's Constitution, entitled “The Laws of Ghana”, has in Article 11(1) the list of laws applicable in the state. This comprises (a) the Constitution; (b) enactments made by or under the authority of the Parliament established by the Constitution; (c) any Orders, Rules and Regulations made by any person or authority under a power conferred by the Constitution; (d) the existing law; and (e) the common law. Thus, the modern-day Constitution of Ghana, like those before it, embraced the English common law by entrenching it in its provisions. The doctrine of judicial precedence which is based on the principle of \"stare decisis\" as applied in England and other pure common law countries also applies in Ghana.\n\nEdward Coke, a 17th-century Lord Chief Justice of the English Court of Common Pleas and a Member of Parliament, wrote several legal texts that collected and integrated centuries of case law. Lawyers in both England and America learned the law from his \"Institutes\" and \"Reports\" until the end of the 18th century. His works are still cited by common law courts around the world.\n\nThe next definitive historical treatise on the common law is \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", written by Sir William Blackstone and first published in 1765–1769. Since 1979, a facsimile edition of that first edition has been available in four paper-bound volumes. Today it has been superseded in the English part of the United Kingdom by Halsbury's Laws of England that covers both common and statutory English law.\n\nWhile he was still on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and before being named to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. published a short volume called \"The Common Law\", which remains a classic in the field. Unlike Blackstone and the Restatements, Holmes' book only briefly discusses what the law \"is\"; rather, Holmes describes the common law \"process\". Law professor John Chipman Gray's \"The Nature and Sources of the Law\", an examination and survey of the common law, is also still commonly read in U.S. law schools.\n\nIn the United States, Restatements of various subject matter areas (Contracts, Torts, Judgments, and so on.), edited by the American Law Institute, collect the common law for the area. The ALI Restatements are often cited by American courts and lawyers for propositions of uncodified common law, and are considered highly persuasive authority, just below binding precedential decisions. The Corpus Juris Secundum is an encyclopedia whose main content is a compendium of the common law and its variations throughout the various state jurisdictions.\n\nScots \"common law\" covers matters including murder and theft, and has sources in custom, in legal writings and previous court decisions. The legal writings used are called \"Institutional Texts\" and come mostly from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include Craig, \"Jus Feudale\" (1655) and Stair, \"The Institutions of the Law of Scotland\" (1681).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

These professional organizations have a common goal of promoting and encouraging the preservation and the accessibility of the world's audiovisual heritage. The CCAAA member organisations work with many AV materials including: films, TV, radio, photographs and audio recordings.\n\nThe Coordinating Council of Audiovisual Archives Associations traces its origins to the Roundtable of Audiovisual Records, which was organized in 1982 in response to the UNESCO report \"Recommendation for the Safeguarding and Preservation of Moving Images\" (1980). The report called for cooperation and coordination between organizations tasked with preserving the world's audiovisual heritage. The five founding members were the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF), the International Federation of Television Archives (FIAT/IFTA), the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), the International Association of Sound Archives (IASA), and the International Council on Archives (ICA). A major early project was organizing a Joint Technical Symposium of preservation experts from around the world, to be held every few years. The first JTS was held in Stockholm in 1983, with later editions in Berlin (1987), Ottawa (1990), London (1995), and Paris (2000). The Roundtable also produced papers on archival matters, and worked closely with UNESCO on audiovisual preservation.\n\nBy 1999 it was felt that the Roundtable needed to become more proactive in shaping policy in the audiovisual archive field, to include lobbying for greater preservation efforts worldwide. To accomplish this it was reconstituted as the CCAAA in 2000, and new members were added. The Joint Technical Symposiums continued, with new conferences held in Toronto (2004, 2007), Oslo (2010), and Singapore (2016). The CCAAA was instrumental in the establishment and management of UNESCO's \"World Day for Audiovisual Heritage\" (observed on October 27 each year), which was approved in 2005 and first observed in 2007. It has also launched an \"Archives at Risk\" initiative to aid endangered archives, and taken positions on subjects as disparate as the impact of copyright on preservation and access and the repatriation of audiovisual heritage items to originating countries.\n\nSince the CCAAA is an \"association of associations,\" its membership generally consists of the president and secretary general (or equivalent) of each of its member organizations. The presidency rotates among the members, and there is also a secretary general and a treasurer.

His major publication was the \"History of the Diocese of St Asaph\", the first such history of a Welsh diocese.\n\nThomas was the son of Owen and Mary Thomas of Bodyfoel, Llanfechain in Montgomeryshire, and he was baptised on 14 September 1833. He was educated at Ruthin School under Edward Barnwell before matriculating at Jesus College, Oxford in 1852. His father died during his time at Oxford and Thomas taught during the university vacations to support himself. He graduated in 1856, but failed to obtain a college fellowship in 1859. After his ordination, he became curate of Rhuddlan in 1857, then curate from 1859 to 1864 of Selattyn in Shropshire (which was at the time part of the Diocese of St Asaph).

The museum was founded in 1987 by the cultural association Flora Gallica. It features 12th-century vaulted wine cellars, collections dedicated to wine-growing and local crafts as well as a medieval garden.\n\nIn the 12th century, Earl of Dreux Robert the First asked the Cistercian monks of Le Breuil-Benoît Abbey (located in Marcilly-sur-Eure) to found a Conventual priory in Dreux at the foot of his castle (situated where the current day Chapelle royale is) in order to grow wine. \nIn the Middle Ages, 250 hectares were dedicated to wine-growing in Dreux and 7,249 in the county (department) of Eure-et-Loir (currently less than a hectare). The Earl of Dreux owned six grape presses, one of which operated at the priory. In the 12th century, a harbour was built on the Blaise river: ships used the (connecting) Eure river to transport wine and other goods to Rouen, Paris or England. \nThe monks dug rib-vaulted cellars into the flint and chalky marl; they were reinforced with double arches based on stone corbels. They used special pickaxes whose notches can still be seen. The cellars were used to store tithe wine, and had side chambers which inhabitants used to take shelter in case of attack.\n\nDreux was a stop-over on the way to Compostela: rolled maps deposited/put in the holes of the vaults' arch supports were available to the pilgrims. Some pilgrims would take small pieces of rock from the walls as a souvenir of their stay. One of the cellars seems to have been dug into the chalky cliff to house the press.\n\nThe monks collected the tithe on wine-growing products until the French Revolution. In 1791, the priory was sold as a \"bien national\" (national property) and transformed into a rural inn. The chapel was razed in 1852. \nThe ecomuseum set up a vineyard again in 1989 and organises a grape-harvest celebration in October.\n\nIn the courtyard, a life-size reproduction of a 13th-century flat-bottomed boat was built by volunteers. This kind of boat could be towed when the river wasn't deep enough. The door of the king's tax collector's house (set on fire by wine-growers in 1789) can also be seen, as well as a cask, a cart and presses. \nAn outbuilding has a display of a 19th-century habitat with a stable, a bakery, a laundry room and two living areas. \nVarious collections can be seen inside. \n\nThe ground floor section is dedicated to wine-growing tools and to vineyard work. The stained-glass windows that are exhibited here reproduce those of Chartres Cathedral, which represent, among other occupations, those of wine traders, coopers and wine-growers. A 17th-century wood and plaster statue called \"Our Lady of the Bunch\" can be seen. The first bunch of grapes was set in its hand for luck. Initially placed in a street of the town, it was sold to a Parisian second-hand goods dealer. Flora Gallica bought it thanks to a contribution.\n\nOn the first floor, ancient bathroom linen and toiletries (curling iron, laces), wine watercolours and clockmaker tools are displayed.\n\nThe \"craftsmen's attic\" houses various spaces showing the traditional trades and their tools (clog maker, saddler, blacksmith, potter etc.) Another room houses a restored apothecary.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Saint-Thibault priory owned a garden cultivated according to Hildegard of Bingen's rules. The ecomuseum has recreated a medieval garden on a plot on the hill with ancient plants which had been used for aromatic, textile and medicinal purposes.\n"}
{"id": "1424155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1424155", "title": "Drogön Chögyal Phagpa", "text": "Drogön Chögyal Phagpa\n\nDrogön Chogyal Phagpa (\"\"', 1235 – 15 December 1280), was the fifth leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism. He was also the first Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty, division of the Mongol Empire, and was concurrently named the director of the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. Historical tradition remembers him as the first vice-ruler of Tibet under the Mongol Khagan as well as one of the Five Sakya patriarchs (). Although this is historically disputed, he played a very important political role.\n\nPhagpa was born in Ngari (West Tibet) in 1235 as the son of Sönam Gyeltsen (, 1184-1239), a member of the Khon family () which held hereditary power over the Sakya Monastery in the Tsang region, and his mother was Kunga Kyi (). The \"Red annals\" name his mother as Jomo Konchog Kyi. He was the nephew of Sakya Pandita (1182-1251), who began the relationship between Sakya and the Mongol conquerors after their first invasion of Tibet in 1240.\n\nIn 1244, Sakya Pandita left Sakya in order to visit the royal camp of Godan Khan, son of Ögedei Khan, to act as intermediary between the Mongols and Tibetans. He brought with him his young nephews, the ten years-old Phagpa and his brother, the six years-old Chakna Dorje. On the way, they stopped in Lhasa, where Phagpa took the vows of a śrāmaṇera at the Jokhang in front of the statue of the Jowo offered by the Princess Wencheng, the Chinese wife of Songtsen Gampo.\n\nSakya Pandita preached sermons along his way and arrived at Godan's camp in Liangzhou in 1247, where Mongol troops were exterminating Han Chinese by throwing them in a river. Sakya Pandita, horrified, gave religious instructions, in particular stressing that killing a sentient being is one of the worst acts according to Buddhism. He gave religious instruction to the prince and greatly impressed the court with his personality and powerful teachings. He is also said to have cured Godan of a serious illness.\n\nIn return, Drogon Chogyel Phagpa was supposedly given \"temporal authority over the 13 myriarchies [\"Trikor Chuksum\"] of Central Tibet.\" Since the myriarchies had not yet emerged as a territorial unit, this cannot be entirely correct. Tibetan historians quote a letter that Sakya Pandita wrote to the local leaders of Tibet in 1249 where he stated that they henceforth must carry out the administration of their fiefs in consultation with the Sakya envoys and in accordance with Mongol law.\n\nAfter the death of Sakya Pandita, the Mongol ruler Möngke Khan dispatched new military campaigns against parts of Tibet in 1252-53. He furthermore shared up the main Tibetan sects among the ruling clan. While he patronized the Drikung Kagyu, Godan protected Sakya and there were at least nine further appanages. Phagpa and his brother remained at the camp of Godan, learned the Mongolian language and took up Mongol dress.\n\nMöngke's brother Kublai, after a brief flirtation with Chan Buddhism, found Tibetan Buddhism more to his liking. In 1253 he asked Godan to give him Chögyal Phagpa, who was then 18. Kublai was subsequently converted to Buddhism by his efforts and Phagpa became his tantric guru in 1258. Under the influence of Kublai's wife Chabi, their mutual relation was defined so that Phagpa had a precedence in religious matters and Kublai in temporal affairs. When the prince received religious instruction from his lama, the latter sat on a higher seat, while Kublai sat higher than Phagpa when he conducted court business. Phagpa further strengthened his case by defeating his Daoist opponents in a great debate in Kublai's newly built city Kaiping in 1258.\n\nShortly after, Kublai Khan took power in a succession struggle after the death of his brother Möngke in 1259. He thereby became the Khagan, the ruler of the Mongols; later on, he became the Emperor of China. Phagpa supported the new lord by presenting him as a chakravartin or universal ruler. Kublai Khan in turn appointed Chögyal Phagpa as his National Preceptor (\"Guoshi\") in 1260, the year when he was proclaimed Khagan. According to Mongol sources, Phagpa was the first one \"to initiate the political theology politics of the relationship between state and religion in the Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhist world\" - that is to say, he developed the concept of the patron and priest relationship. With the support of Kublai Khan, Chögyal Phagpa established himself and the Sakya as the preeminent political power in Tibet.\n\nKublai Khan commissioned Chögyal Phagpa to design a new writing system to unify the writing of the multilingual Yuan China. Phagpa modified the Tibetan alphabet to create his 'Phags-pa script, which was completed in 1268. Kublai Khan decided to use the 'Phags-pa script as the official writing system of the empire, including when he became Emperor of China in 1271, instead of Chinese characters or the Old Uyghur alphabet formerly used for Mongolian. However, he encountered major resistances and difficulties when trying to promote this script and never achieved his original goal. As a result, only a small amount of texts were written in this script, and the majority (including most official documents) were still written in Chinese ideograms or the Uyghur alphabet. The script fell into disuse after the collapse of the Yuan in 1368. The script was used for about a century and is thought to have influenced the development of Hangul.\n\nPhagpa's diaries for 1271 mention a foreign friend of Kublai Khan, who was quite possibly one of the elder Polos or even Marco Polo, although, unfortunately, no name is given.\n\nThe Sakya-Mongol alliance was strong, and the see () of the Sakya became the capital of Tibet. According to later historiography, Kublai Khan (who founded of the Yuan dynasty in 1271) granted the three \"cholka\" or regions of Tibet (Ü-Tsang, Amdo and Kham) to Phagpa as a reward for the initiation in the Buddhist faith. The donation would have taken place in 1253. However, this tradition has been qualified by recent research. As mentioned above, Kublai's brother and predecessor Möngke Khan divided Central Tibet into appanages obedient under various Mongol princes in 1251. In the next year he issued a decree saying that the main Buddhist precepts to be followed in Tibet were to be those of Sakya. In about 1260 the appanage system was withdrawn, and Phagpa, receiving the title State Preceptor (Guoshi), was acknowledged as the supreme head of the Buddhist clergy.\n\nIn 1264, Kublai Khan established the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. At about the same time, Phagpa was sent from the court to Tibet in order to persuade the local leaders to accept the imposition of Mongol administration. It was his first visit to his homeland since childhood. Phagpa received the new title of Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) in 1270, partly as a reward for his invention of the Phagpa script. As such, he was expected to stay close to the emperor and had a paramount influence over the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. His decrees carried the weight of the imperial court which gave him a strong authority over Tibetan affairs.\n\nHowever, Phagpa mostly resided in Lintao in Gansu and apparently had desultory contacts with the emperor. He vacated the post by 1274 and returned to Sakya, leaving the title to his brother, Rinchen Gyaltsen.\n\nKublai Khan made Phagpa's other brother Chakna Dorje viceroy of Tibet in 1264. However, he died in 1267 and no new viceroy was appointed for many years. His untimely death was followed by a rebellion led by the Drikung Kagyu, the main opponents of the Sakya. Kublai Khan sent a punitive force to Tibet, which suppressed the uprising by 1268.\n\nTemporal administration of Tibet was actually in the hands of officials from Sakya known as \"dpon-chen\" or \"pönchen\". Their functions were defined as follows: \"He governs by order of the lama and by the mandate of the emperor. He protects the two laws (religious and civil) and keeps the realm tranquil and the religion flourishing.\" A \"dpon-chen\" with responsibility for Central Tibet was stationed in Sakya from c. 1264. An implemented Mongol rule began about 1268-69 when a census was carried out and a Mongol administrative structure was set up. By this time Central Tibet was divided into 13 \"trikor\", usually rendered in English as \"myriarchies\", each under a local lord called \"tripon\". Meanwhile, other Sakya \"dpon-chen\" resided in Gongyo in Doto (Kham) and Lingtsang in Doma (Amdo). The \"dpon-chen\" of Ü-Tsang in this period were:\n\nPhagpa and his successors as Sakya lamas were not literally viceroys under the Yuan although they were at the center of the Yuan administrative system in Tibet. Moreover, after Phagpa the offices of Imperial Preceptor and Sakya Trizin were kept strictly separate. While the later chronicles depict Phagpa and his successors as ruling over the 13 myriarchies and in an extended sense over the three \"cholka\", the authority of the Sakya Trizin was restricted to spiritual affairs. Given the paramount importance of the Buddhist religious hierarchy in Tibet, this still gave him an amount of influence.\n\nPhagpa spent his last years in Tibet, where he was busy strengthening Sakya-Yuan authority over the still-restless country. He convened a general conference of the Buddhist hierarchs in 1277 with both spiritual and political leanings. He died in the Lhakhang palace in Sakya on 15 December 1280. There was an unsubstantiated rumour that he had been poisoned by the former \"pönchen\" Kunga Zangpo, whom he had dismissed some years previously for highhanded conduct. This led to an armed intervention by an army of Mongols and Amdo Tibetans in the next year, resulting in the execution of Kunga Zangpo and the strengthening of Mongol military presence in Tibet.\n\nThe system lasted until about the middle of the 14th century. During the reign of the 14th Sakya Trizin, Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen, the myriarch Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen of the Phagmodrupa Dynasty began to expand his power in the central province of Ü, marking the \"beginning of the end of the period of Sakya power in Central Tibet.\"\n\nPhagpa is played by James Hong in the 1982 miniseries Marco Polo. In the series he is erroneously depicted as alive at the time of the departure of Marco Polo from China in 1293.\n\nChogyal Phagpa: The Emperor's Guru (Sakya Kongma Series Book 5).

Written between 935-973, \"Dulcitius\" is widely believed to be her most comic work. The play treats the figure of Dulcitius, governor of Thessalonica, as a subject for a comedy in the style of Terence. Although the play is dark, with a plot depicts the imprisonment and martyrdom of the three sisters, Agape, Chionia, and Irena, nevertheless its content is presumably deemed less grave because of the reward awaiting the Christian sufferers.\n\nThe Roman Emperor Diocletian wants to arrange marriages to members of his imperial court for three virgin sisters, Agape, Chionia, and Irena. He insists they must renounce their Christian faith and worship the Roman gods. When the sisters refuse, the emperor orders them imprisoned and examined by Governor Dulcitius. When Dulcitius sees how beautiful the sisters are, he declares that he is in love. He tells his soldiers to lock them in the kitchen so he \"can visit them oftener\". That night, in the darkness of the kitchen, Dulcitius embraces the pots and pans, thinking they are the women.\n\nWhen he leaves the kitchen, Dulcitius is covered in soot and unrecognizable. The soldiers think he is possessed and run away from him. Not realizing he is covered in soot, Dulcitius goes to the palace to tell the imperial court how he has been insulted. He is beaten and denied admittance to the palace because the ushers do not recognize him.\n\nWhen Dulcitius goes to his wife, he realizes what has happened. In retaliation for his embarrassment, he commands that Agape, Chionia, and Irena be stripped in public. However, the soldiers are unable to remove the robes from the women's bodies. Since Dulcitius is sleeping, the soldiers tell Diocletian what has happened. The enraged emperor orders Count Sisinnius to punish the sisters.\n\nSisinnius has Agape and Chionia brought to him, believing that the younger Irena will change her views if she is no longer influenced by her older sisters. He orders Agape and Chionia burned alive when they refuse to sacrifice to the Roman gods. Their spirits leave their bodies, but their bodies and clothes miraculously are not burned.\n\nSisinnius threatens Irena with execution, but she refuses to renounce her faith. He orders the soldiers to \"drag her to the lowest brothel you can find\". However, the soldiers quickly return and tell Sisinnius that Irena has escaped. Two well-dressed men came to them on the way to the brothel, saying Sisinnius wanted her taken to the top of a mountain. Sisinnius and the soldiers go to the mountain, but are unable to go up it. As Irena stands at the top, Sisinnius orders one of the soldiers to shoot her with an arrow. She dies looking forward to heaven.\n\nThe characters in the play, in order of appearance:\n\nThere is little information on Hrosvitha's life and background. According to information she provided in \"Carmen de Primordiis Coenobii Gandersheimensis\", she was born a long time after the death of Otto the Illustrious (November 30, 912), but was older than the daughter of Henry, Duke of Bavaria, Gerberga II (born after the year 940). Based on this information, Hrosvitha was born between 912 and 940, though historians generally agree that her date of birth is closer to 935.\n\nHrosvitha divided her work into three books: \"Liber Primus\", \"Liber Secundus\", and \"Liber Tertius\". The first book is poetry, while the second book has the six plays she is largely known for, including \"Dulcitius\". The third book contains poetry and also the text from which historians have been able to deduce her approximate year of birth.\n\nThe playwright Terence was an influence on Hrosvitha. She copied his style in the praising of virgins. In Hrosvitha's preface to her collection, she acknowledges Terence's influence, noting that her plays provide an alternative for those who appreciate Terence's style. Her approach substitutes \"the laudable chastity of holy maidens\" for his \"unchaste actions of sensual women\". This relationship between Terence and Hrosvitha represent a link between classical drama and the medieval morality plays.\n\nThe play's original title was \"Passio Sanctarum Virginum Agapis Chioniae Et Hirenae\" (\"The Passion of the Holy Virgins Agape, Chionia, and Irena\"), but has become more commonly known as \"Dulcitius\" because he serves as the central character in the comedic scenes. \"Dulcitius\" is considered to be Hrosvitha's most comedic work. However, just 56 lines out of 286 lines in the play are considered to be comedic and Dulcitius is only present in the first part of the play. Because of his limited presence, some have criticized Hrosvitha for creating no connection between the plotline of Dulcitius' adventures and that of the martyrdom of the three girls.\n\nHrosvitha's plays are believed to be aimed towards the Christian ideal of the virginal woman, and intended for reading rather than for performance. Her intention was likely for her plays to be read aloud by the Sisters of her convent. However, some scholars dismiss the solely Christian context of Hrosvitha's writings, instead claiming that her plays provided women with models for female integrity, thus encouraging more positive views of women.\n\n"}

Hancock specialises in pseudoscientific theories involving ancient civilisations, stone monuments or megaliths, altered states of consciousness, ancient myths, and astronomical or astrological data from the past.\n\nOne theme of his works proposes a connection with a 'mother culture' from which he believes other ancient civilisations sprang. An example of pseudoarchaeology, his work has neither been peer reviewed nor published in academic journals.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh, Scotland, Hancock spent his formative years in India, where his father worked as a surgeon. Having returned to the UK, he graduated from Durham University in 1973, receiving a First Class Honours degree in sociology.\n\nGraham Hancock is married to Santha Faiia. Santha Faiia is a Malaysian of Tamil origin from Penang, Malaysia, and she is also a professional photographer specializing in ancient cultures and monuments. They have six children.\n\nAs a journalist, Hancock worked for many British papers, such as \"The Times\", \"The Sunday Times\", \"The Independent\", and \"The Guardian\". He co-edited \"New Internationalist\" magazine from 1976 to 1979, and served as the East Africa correspondent of \"The Economist\" from 1981 to 1983.\n\nHancock describes himself as an \"unconventional thinker who raises controversial questions about humanity's past\". Prior to 1990 his works dealt mainly with problems of economic and social development. Since 1990 his works have focused mainly on speculative connections he makes between various archaeological, historical, and cross-cultural phenomena.\n\nHis books include \"Lords of Poverty\", \"The Sign and the Seal\", \"Fingerprints of the Gods\", \"Keeper of Genesis\" (released in the US as \"Message of the Sphinx\"), \"The Mars Mystery\", \"Heaven's Mirror\" (with wife Santha Faiia), \"Underworld: The Mysterious Origins of Civilization\", and \"Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith\" (with co-author Robert Bauval). In 1996 he appeared in \"The Mysterious Origins of Man\". He also wrote and presented the documentaries \"Underworld: Flooded Kingdoms of the Ice Age\" (2002) and \"Quest for the Lost Civilisation\" (1998) shown on Channel 4.\n\nIn Hancock's book \"Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith\", co-authored with Robert Bauval, the two put forward what sociologist of religion David V. Barrett called \"a version of the old Jewish-Masonic plot so beloved by ultra-right-wing conspiracy theorists.\" They suggest a connection between the pillars of Solomon's Temple and the Twin Towers, and between the Star of David and The Pentagon. A contemporary review of \"Talisman\" by David V. Barrett for \"The Independent\" pointed to a lack of originality as well as basic factual errors, concluding that it was \"a mish-mash of badly-connected, half-argued theories\". In a 2008 piece for \"The Telegraph\" referencing \"Talisman\", Damian Thompson described Hancock and Bauval as fantasists.\n\nHancock's \"Supernatural: Meetings With the Ancient Teachers of Mankind\", was published in the UK in October 2005 and in the US in 2006. In it, Hancock examines paleolithic cave art in the light of David Lewis-Williams' neuropsychological model, exploring its relation to the development of the fully modern human mind.\n\nIn 2015, his \"Magicians of the Gods: The Forgotten Wisdom of Earth's Lost Civilization\" was published by St. Martin's Press.\n\nHis first novel, \"Entangled: The Eater of Souls\", the first in a fantasy series, was published in the UK in April 2010 and in the US in October 2010. The novel makes use of Hancock's prior research interests and as he has noted, \"What was there to lose, I asked myself, when my critics already described my factual books as fiction?\"\n\nHis books have sold more than five million copies worldwide and have been translated into 27 languages. \n\nCanadian author Heather Pringle has placed Hancock within a particular pseudo-intellectual tradition going back at least to Heinrich Himmler's infamous research institute, the \"Ahnenerbe\". She specifically links Hancock's book \"Fingerprints of the Gods\" to the work of Nazi archaeologist Edmund Kiss, a man described by mainstream scientists of the time as a \"complete idiot\". \n\nOne of the many recurring themes in several of Hancock's works has been an exposition on the \"Orion correlation theory\" (or OCT), supported by Belgian writer Robert Bauval and then further expounded in collaborative works with Hancock, as well as in their separate publications.\n\nBBC Two's \"Horizon\" TV series broadcast a programme, \"Atlantis Reborn\", on 4 November 1999 that challenged the ideas presented by Hancock. It detailed one of Hancock's claims that the arrangement of an ancient temple complex was designed to mirror astronomical features and attempted to demonstrate that the same thing could be done with perhaps equal justification using famous landmarks in New York. It also alleged that Hancock had selectively moved or ignored the locations of some of the temples to fit his own theories (see below).\n\nHancock claimed he was misrepresented by the programme, and he and Robert Bauval made complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Commission against the way \"Horizon\" had portrayed them and their work. Eight points were raised by Hancock, two by Bauval (one of which duplicated a complaint of Hancock's). These included the complaint that:\n\nThe programme had created the impression that he [Hancock] was an intellectual fraudster who had put forward half-baked theories and ideas in bad faith, and that he was incompetent to defend his own arguments.\nAdjudication: [The Commission] finds no unfairness to Mr Hancock in these matters.\nThe BSC dismissed all but one of the complaints. Overall, the BSC concluded that \"the programme makers acted in good faith in their examination of the theories of Mr Hancock and Mr Bauval\". The complaint which was upheld was that The programme unfairly omitted one of their arguments in rebuttal of a speaker who criticised the theory of a significant correlation between the Giza pyramids and the belt stars of the constellation Orion (the \"correlation theory\") which the Commission did find to be unfair. That speaker was the astronomer Edwin Krupp. Krupp argued that Bauval had fudged the maps of Orion and the Pyramids by placing them upside down in terms of stellar directionality to make the theory work. The BBC was not obligated to do more than broadcast an apology for the single point of unfairness but made a decision to modify the Orion sequence to demonstrate that the overall argument of the film remained intact.\n\nIn \"Atlantis Reborn Again\", shown on 14 December 2000, Hancock and Bauval provided further rebuttals to Krupp and argued that the ancient Egyptians had made the Pyramids correlate with the three stars of Orion's Belt. However, the documentary as a whole continued to present serious doubts about Hancock's claims, demonstrating as an example how, by using his methods, the constellation of Leo may be 'discovered' among landmarks of modern Manhattan, concluding: \"As long as you have enough points and you don't need to make every point fit, you can find virtually any pattern you want.\"\n\nHancock gave a TEDx lecture titled \"The War on Consciousness\", in which he described his use of ayahuasca, an amazonian brew containing a hallucinogenic compound DMT, and argued that adults should be allowed to responsibly use it for self-improvement and spiritual growth. At the recommendation of TED's Science Board, the lecture was removed from the TEDx YouTube channel and moved to TED's main website where it \"can be framed to highlight both [Hancock's] provocative ideas and the factual problems with [his] arguments\".\n\nIn 2009, Roland Emmerich released his blockbuster disaster movie \"2012\", citing \"Fingerprints of the Gods\" in the credits as an inspiration for the film, stating: \"I always wanted to do a biblical flood movie, but I never felt I had the hook. I first read about the Earth's Crust Displacement Theory in Graham Hancock's \"Fingerprints of the Gods\".\" Also in 2009, author Geoff Stray released his best-selling book \"Beyond 2012: Catastrophe or Awakening?\" in which he cites Graham Hancock as one of his inspirations and as a guidepost to point others to do their own investigation into the wonder of ancient societies.\n\n\n\n\n"}

From here they intended to relaunch their offensive and reach the Meuse river. From 20 September, the Germans attacked on a line from Étain to Pont-à-Mousson and in several days had effectively created a bulge in the French line reaching as far as Saint-Mihiel, where they were halted by General Taverna's 16th Army Corps. What was to be known as the \"St Mihiel Salient\" was formed.\n\nPart of the area taken by the Germans was the ridge or \"Crête\" at Les Éparges. This ridge was of great strategic importance because of the views in gave over the Woëvre plain and the French knew that they would never be able to retake the plain without first taking Hauts de Meuse and in particular the ridge at Les Éparges .\n\nIn the 1914-1918 war, the ridge at Les Éparges at 346 meters high was to serve as a counterpoint to the Butte de Vauquois. Both these areas of high ground served as eastern and western ends to the Verdun sector of the Western Front. Both were fought over fiercely and both were the scene of intensive mine warfare after head to head encounters produced no noticeable break through for either side.\n\nThe main French attempts to take the ridge were launched by General Joffre in 1915 and that year saw a series of French attacks, all fought with fierce intensity and resulting in much loss of life. The encounters embraced the Tranchée de Calonne, the woods of Chavalier and the wood at Brûlée. The ridge itself saw many bitter encounters and the terrain was soon changed for ever by the detonation of mines the digging of tunnels and constant artillery shelling.\n\nFrom 5 to 14 April 1915, the 1st French Army under General Roques engaged the Germans on the ridge and the Woëvre plain but they were unable to take the ridge. At one point they advanced as far as \"Point X\", the furthest point east on the ridge and that giving the best views over the plain but they were soon forced back. The ridge was divided by the French into various areas gauged in their distance from the original French front line. Thus \"Point A\" was the nearest to the French trenches and \"Point X\" the furthest away. These attacks absorbed the attention of the entire French 1st Army and they lost the equivalent of an entire division – almost 18,000 men. It was no accident that Maurice Genevoix, the French novelist, was to call his narrative of the battle, \"La Morte\"- Death.\n\nThe trench fighting was not restricted to the Les Éparges ridge and south of St Mihiel there were encounters in the Ailly wood and that at Brûlée. Here the fighting involved General Bourges' 8th Army Corps.\n\nOnce the many encounters of 1915 had produced no major breakthrough for either side, the fighting on the surface was less intense and fighting moved underground and over the years of the war the ridge continued to be mined comprehensively from Point C to Point X. Now the fighting was to go underground to an even greater extent, with a war of tunnels and mines and in this period, 46 German mines and 32 French mines were detonated but still without producing any change in the front line.\n\nIn 1916, the waging of the Battle of Verdun saw the French withdraw voluntarily from the Woëvre plain area from 22 to 26 February and the French took up their main defensive position around the Fort at Moulainville which was bombarded by the German 420mm guns.\n\nThere was no great change to the front line in 1917 and it was only when the Americans attacked on 12 September 1918 that the salient was to again hear the roar of the guns and be finally freed from German occupation.\n\nToday one can see many reminders of these encounters in the ridge's terrain and there are several monuments and memorials to mark the contributions of those who fought here and this list will identify and describe some of them\n\nJust by the Monument at Point X there is a small memorial to the soldiers of the 302nd who died fighting here from 20 September 1914 to 21 March 1915. It also covers the actions of the 102nd. The inscription reads \n\nWhen the German armies launched their five great offensives of 1918, the Allies realised that the situation was perilous and that the arrival of the American troops was now crucial but when these troops began to reach France, General John. J. Pershing, the Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces, was reluctant to allow his men to be rushed into action and used piecemeal but wanted to concentrate on consolidation and acclimatisation and getting his men organised as an effective fighting units. He did however release to French control some of his troops when the German third and fifth offensives put the French Army under great pressure and these contributions and the efforts of the units involved are recorded at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and on the Chateau-Thierry Monument.\n\nOnce the success of the Second Battle of the Marne had seen the German Army retreating, the Allied Command were determined to keep the Germans on the back foot and several major offensives were planned at an Allied conference on 24 July. 1918. The British and French forces were allocated the sector around Amiens and the St Mihiel sector was allocated to the Americans. This salient projected roughly 16 miles into the Allied line and ran from Verdun in the north, south to St Mihiel and then east to Pont-a-Mousson on the Moselle River. The area was bordered by a line of hills known as the Heights of the Meuse and a succession of marshes and lakes situated across deep ravines and dense forests. The salient also protected the strategic rail centre of Metz and the Briey iron basin, a rich source for the Germans of raw material for munitions production. It also constituted an ongoing threat to Verdun and Nancy. It was essential that the salient be reduced before any larger offensive be launched against Metz or Briery or in the Argonne sector further north which had also been allocated to the Americans.\n\nOn 30 August, the U.S.First Army was asked to limit its efforts to the reduction of the salient so that very soon after it could undertake the larger task presented in the Meuse/Argonne area.\n\nThe St. Mihiel offensive began on 12 September with a threefold assault on the salient. The main attack was made against the south face by two American corps. The First Corps was on the right(from right to left the 82nd, 90th, 5th, and 2nd Divisions in line with the 78th in reserve) and covered a front from Pont-à-Mousson on the Moselle, westward to Limey, while on the left, the Fourth Corps (from right to left the 89th, 42nd, and 1st Divisions in line with the 3rd in reserve) extended along a front from Limey westward to Marvoisin. A secondary thrust was carried out against the west face of the salient along the Heights of the Meuse, from Mouilly north to Haudimont, by the Fifth Corps (from right to left the 26th Division, the French 15th Colonial Division, and the 8th Brigade, 4th Division in line with the rest of the 4th in reserve). A holding attack against the apex, to keep the enemy in the salient, was made by the French II Colonial Corps (from right to left the French 39th Colonial Division, the French 26th Division, and the French 2d Cavalry Division in line). In the First Army reserve were the American 35th, 80th, and 91st Divisions. The Allies also mobilized 1,481 aircraft to provide air superiority and close air support over the front.\n\nDefending the salient was German \"Army Detachment C\", consisting of eight divisions and a brigade in the line and about two divisions in reserve. The Germans had begun a step-by-step withdrawal from the salient the day before.\n\nBy 16 September, the salient was eliminated and now the Americans would need to move their focus to the Meuse-Argonne.\n\nIn the village of Flirey is this monument celebrating the joint Franco-American action which took place in 1918.\n\nThis area of the Western Front has many literary associations. These include:-\n\n"}

{"id": "23105930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23105930", "title": "Peter the Patrician", "text": "Peter the Patrician\n\nPeter the Patrician (, , \"Petros ho Patrikios\"; –565) was a senior East Roman or Byzantine official, diplomat, and historian. A well-educated and successful lawyer, he was repeatedly sent as envoy to Ostrogothic Italy in the prelude to the Gothic War of 535–554. Despite his diplomatic skill, he was not able to avert war, and was imprisoned by the Goths in Ravenna for a few years. Upon his release, he was appointed to the post of \"magister officiorum\", head of the imperial secretariat, which he held for an unparalleled 26 years. In this capacity, he was one of the leading ministers of Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565), playing an important role in the Byzantine emperor's religious policies and the relations with Sassanid Persia; most notably he led the negotiations for the peace agreement of 562 that ended the 20-year-long Lazic War. His historical writings survive only in fragments, but provide unique source material on early Byzantine ceremonies and diplomatic issues between Byzantium and the Sassanids.\n\nPeter was born in Thessalonica about the year 500, and was of Illyrian origin according to Procopius; according to Theophylact Simocatta, however, his origin was from Solachon, near Dara in Mesopotamia. After studying law, he embarked on a successful career as a lawyer in Constantinople, which brought him to the attention of Empress Theodora. In 534, on account of his rhetorical skills, he was employed as an imperial envoy to the Ostrogothic court at Ravenna. At the time, a power struggle was developing there between Queen Amalasuntha, regent to the young king Athalaric, and her cousin Theodahad. Following the death of Athalaric, Theodahad usurped the throne, imprisoned Amalasuntha, and sent messages to Emperor Justinian hoping for recognition. Peter met the envoys at Aulon, on his way to Italy, and notified Constantinople, seeking new instructions. Emperor Justinian ordered him to convey the message to Theodahad that Amalasuntha was under the Emperor's protection and not to be harmed. Nevertheless, at the time Peter arrived in Italy, Amalasuntha had been killed; Procopius's narrative in the \"Gothic War\" is ambiguous here, but in his \"Secret History\", he explicitly claims that Peter arranged the murder of Amalasuntha on instructions from Theodora, who feared her as a potential rival for Justinian's attentions. Whatever assurances might have been privately given by Theodora to Theodahad, in public, Peter strongly condemned the act, and declared that there would be \"war without truce between the emperor and themselves\" as a result.\n\nPeter then returned to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, but by the time he reached the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy in the summer of 535 conveying an ultimatum: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted. A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: Belisarius took Sicily, while Mundus invaded Dalmatia. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were to be provided for the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status. Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, under oath, to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius, bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time it seemed as if the cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the fold. It was not to be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition. Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia, he resolved to resist, and imprisoned the ambassadors.\n\nPeter remained imprisoned in Ravenna for three years, until released in June/July 539 by the new Gothic king, Witigis, in exchange for Gothic envoys sent to Persia who had been captured by the Byzantines. As a reward for his services, Emperor Justinian then appointed Peter to the post of \"magister officiorum\" (\"Master of the Offices\"), one of the highest positions in the state, heading the palace secretariat, the imperial guards (the \"Scholae Palatinae\"), and the Public Post with the dreaded \"agentes in rebus\". He would hold this post for 26 consecutive years, longer by a wide margin than any other before or after. At about the same time or shortly thereafter, he was raised to the supreme title of patrician and the supreme senatorial rank of \"gloriosissimus\" (\"most glorious one\"). He was also awarded an honorary consulship. As \"magister\", he took part in the discussions with Western bishops in 548 on the Three-Chapter Controversy, and was repeatedly sent as an envoy in 551–553 to Pope Vigilius, who opposed the emperor on the issue. Peter is also recorded as attending the Second Council of Constantinople in May 553.\n\nIn 550, he was sent as envoy by Justinian to negotiate a peace treaty with Persia, a role he reprised in 561, when he met the Persian envoy Izedh Gushnap at Dara, to end the Lazic War. Reaching an agreement over the Persian evacuation of Lazica and the delineation of the border in Armenia, the two envoys concluded a fifty-year peace between the two empires and their respective allies. The annual Roman subsidies to Persia would resume, but the amount was lowered from 500 to 420 pounds of gold. Further clauses regulated cross-border trade, which was to be limited to the two cities of Dara and Nisibis, the return of fugitives, and the protection of the respective religious minorities (Christians in the Persian Empire and Zoroastrians in Byzantium). In exchange for Persian recognition for the existence of Dara, whose construction had originally sparked a brief war, the Byzantines agreed to limit their troops there and remove the seat of the \"magister militum per Orientem\" from the city. As disagreements remained on two border areas, Suania and Ambros, in spring 562, Peter travelled to Persia to negotiate directly with the Persian Shah, Chosroes I, without however achieving a result. He then returned to Constantinople, where he died sometime after March 565.\n\nHis son Theodore, nicknamed Kontocheres or Zetonoumios, would succeed him as \"magister officiorum\" in 566, after a brief interval where the post was held by the \"quaestor sacri palatii\" (\"Quaestor of the Sacred Palace\") Anastasius. He held the post until some time before 576, being appointed as \"comes sacrarum largitionum\" (\"Count of the Sacred Largess\") thereafter; in the same year, he also led an unsuccessful embassy to Persia to end the ongoing war over the Caucasus.\n\nAs one of the leading officials of the age, Peter was a controversial figure, receiving greatly differing assessments from his contemporaries. To John Lydus, a mid-level bureaucrat of the praetorian prefecture of the East, Peter was a paragon of every virtue, an intelligent, firm but fair administrator and a kind man. Procopius in his public histories attests his mild manners and desire to avoid giving insult, but in his private \"Secret History\" he accuses him of \"robbing the \"scholares\"\" (the members of the \"Scholae\") and being \"the biggest thief in the world and absolutely filled with shameful avarice\", as well as being responsible for the murder of Amalasuntha.\n\nFrom quite early in his career, Peter was renowned for his learning, his passion for reading, and his discussions with scholars. As a speaker, he was eloquent and persuasive; Procopius calls him \"fitted by nature to persuade men\", while Cassiodorus, who witnessed his embassies to the Ostrogoth court, also praises him as \"vir eloquentissimus\" and \"disertissimus\" (\"most eloquent man\"), and as \"sapientissimus\" (\"most wise\"). On the other hand, the late 6th-century historian Menander Protector, who relied on Peter's work for his own history, accuses him of boastfulness and of rewriting the records to enhance his own role and performance in the negotiations with the Persians.\n\nPeter wrote three books, all of which survive only in fragments: a history of the first four centuries of the Roman Empire, from the death of Julius Caesar in 44 BC to the death of Emperor Constantius II in 361 AD, of which about twenty fragments are extant (it has been suggested that the third-century material in this was taken from Philostratus); a history of the office of \"magister officiorum\" from its institution under Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) to the time of Justinian, containing a list of its holders and descriptions of various imperial ceremonies, several of which are reproduced in chapters 84–95 of the first volume of the 10th-century \"De Ceremoniis\" of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913–959); and an account of his diplomatic mission to the Persian Empire in 561–562, which has been used as a source by Menander Protector. Until recently, Peter was also ascribed the authorship of the 6th-century \"Peri Politikes Epistemes\" (\"On Political Science\"), a six-volume book discussing political theory, drawing extensively from Classical texts such as Plato's \"The Republic\" and Cicero's \"De re publica\". It too survives only in fragments.\n\nPeter was the first late Roman/Byzantine author to write on imperial ceremonies, beginning a tradition that lasted unto the 14th century. His histories are also an important historical source; for instance, his work alone preserves the negotiations and provisions of the Roman–Persian treaty of 298 between Galerius and Narseh.\n\n\"The Lost\" History \"of Peter the Patrician\", published by Routledge in 2015, is an annotated translation from the Greek by Thomas M. Banchich of the fragments of Peter’s \"History\", including additional fragments which used to be considered the work of the Roman historian Cassius Dio's so-called Anonymous Continuer.\n\n"}

Current legislation mandates the title of Prince of Asturias to the heir of the Spanish throne but allows for the use of other traditional titles; The current title-holder therefore, is Leonor, Princess of Asturias.\n\nIt originated in 1351 when King Peter IV of Aragon named his successor, to whom he conceded the title of Duke of Girona; the title embraced territories of the counties of Girona, Besalú, Empúries and Ausona.\n\nIn part I of the \"Constitucions i Altres Drets de Cathalunya\", the section headed \"Genealogia dels Reys d'Aragó i Comtes de Barcelona\" speaks of the genealogy of John I of Aragon, son of Peter IV, saying that John and Violant had a son named James, \"lo qual intitularen Delphi de Girona\". On 19 February 1416, Ferdinand I of Aragon, considering the title of duke insufficient, raised it to the rank of Principality of Girona. However, these titles fell into gradual disuse until the 20th century as the heir of the King of Spain became better known by the hereditary title of the Crown of Castile, \"Prince of Asturias.\"\n\nIn 1961, when announcing the wedding the future Juan Carlos I of Spain and Sofia of Greece, the Spanish Royal House issued the young prince, as titles of pretense, the style of \"Prince of Asturias,\" \"Prince of Girona,\" and \"Prince of Viana\" — these three titles referring to his status as heir apparent to the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon and Navarre respectively. He started using the titles of \"Prince of Girona\" on his passport during the rule of caudillo Franco, to avoid the more contentious title Prince of Asturias which was well known to be reserved for the heir of the throne of Spain. His father had adopted a similar tactic, styling himself Juan, Count of Barcelona; using the title of King of Spain would have been seen as directly subersive to the Francoist State. However, calling himself Count of Barcelona was a clear attempt at asserting his hereditary rights to then defunct Spanish throne, as there had been no Count of Barcelona who was not either King of Aragon or of Spain since the Middle Ages.\n\nWhen Juan Carlos was finally given an official capacity in the Spanish state as heir to the kingdom by General Franco, he received the title of \"Prince of Spain\" and thus began to use this until he became King of Spain. On 21 January 1977 his son, Felipe, would be the first to use all of these titles in any official capacity for over 250 years.\n\nWith the accession of Felipe to the throne in 2014, his elder daughter Leonor became Princess of Girona, as heiress presumptive to the throne of Aragon. \nThe Princess of Girona Foundation was created in 2009 and is now run on behalf of Princess Leonor: it funds programmes to aid young people. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1325838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1325838", "title": "Russian ballet", "text": "Russian ballet\n\nRussian ballet () is a form of ballet characteristic of or originating from Russia.\n\nUntil 1689, ballet in Russia was nonexistent. The Tsarist control and isolationism in Russia allowed for little influence from the West. It wasn't until the rise of Peter the Great that Russian society opened up to the West. St. Petersburg was erected to embrace the West and compete against Moscow’s isolationism. Peter the Great created a new Russia which rivaled the society of the West with magnificent courts and palaces. His vision was to challenge the west. Classical ballet entered the realm of Russia not as entertainment, but as a “standard of physical comportment to be emulated and internalized-an idealized way of behaving.” The aim was not to entertain the masses of Russians, but to cultivate a new Russian people. \nEmpress Anna, (1730 – 1740) was devoted to ostentatious amusements (balls, fireworks, tableaux), and in the summer of 1734 ordered the appointment of Jean-Baptiste Landé as dancing-master in the military academy she had founded in 1731 for sons of the nobility. In 1738, he became ballet master and head of the new ballet school, launching the advanced study of ballet in Russia, and winning the patronage of elite families.\n\nFrance provided many leaders such as Charles Didelot in St Petersburg (1801-1831), Jules Perrot (1848-1859) and Arthur Saint-Léon (1859-69).\n\nIn the early 19th century, the theaters were opened up to anyone who could afford a ticket. A seating section called a rayok, or 'paradise gallery', consisted of simple wooden benches. This allowed non-wealthy people access to the ballet, because tickets in this section were inexpensive.\n\nOne author describes the Imperial ballet as “unlike that of any other country in the world…the most prestigious of the ballet troupes were those attached to the state-supported theatres. The directors of these companies were personally appointed by the tsar, and all the dancers were, in a sense, Imperial servants. In the theatre, the men in the audience always remained standing until the tsar entered his box and, out of respect, after the performance they remained in their places until he had departed. Curtain calls were arranged according to a strict pattern: first, the ballerina bowed to the tsar’s box, then to that of the theater director, and finally to the general public.\n\nBy the early 1900s the Russian ballet went beyond its borders and infiltrated Paris. It had become its own force and was distinctly Russian, while still being embraced by the Parisian society. In 1903 Ivan Clustine, a Russian dancer and choreographer who had started his career at the Bolshoi Theatre, was appointed Maître de ballet at the Paris Opera. Clustine's hiring promoted a frenzy of questions about his nationality and choreographic agenda: “His hiring was thought a direct attempt by the Opera to imitate the Russian company; even he thought as much, maintaining, not without despondency, that inspiration too often came from the north: ‘A revolution! A method that people often apply in the country of the tsars.’ Clustine, although acknowledging his nationality with pride, harbored none of the revolutionary intentions that some thought an inevitable consequence of being Russian.”\n\nThe Parisians, while denying adoption of the backwards Russian troupe, had distinct Russian influence in their theater. “Despite Clustine’s protestations, several features of the Opera’s post-1909 ballets, along with its institutional conventions and balletic policy, appeared to betray a Russian influence.” The stigma of Russian brutality and force was applied even in Paris. While their style was not only being accepted in Paris, but implemented in Paris theaters, the Ballets Russes were still considered dangerous, even in the theatre of performing art. “The Ballets Russes, at base, became a metaphor for invasion, an eternal force that could engulf and control, could penetrate the membrane of French society, culture and even art itself.” The embracing of Russian ballet in the Paris society became a point of contention and French nationalism collided with Russian determination. Questions arose about the Russian intention in the Paris theaters under the title “cultural politics” including “the delimitation of boundaries, the preservation of identity and the nature of relational engagements.” Russia was incapable of simply bringing Russian culture to the West, but created a paranoia of intentions wherever they went. In the beginning, the relationship between Russia and France through the arts was a testimony to their political allegiances. “French critics acknowledged a shared choreographic heritage: French ballet had migrated to Russia in the nineteenth century, only to return, decades later, under the guise of the Ballets Russes. The company, then, moored in a history that intertwined both nations, not only contributed to a cultural programme of exchange. The Ballets Russes were a testament to Franco-Russian cooperation, goodwill and support; they represented ‘un nouveau resserrement de l’alliance’ (a further strengthening of the alliance).” However, the relationship made a negative turn when duplicity amongst the alliance arose. While Russia continued to borrow money from the French banks, “the Russians no longer interested in supporting French culture and colonial politics.” This duplicity gave fuel for the paranoia and lack of trust we see in the relationship concerning the arts. The Parisian press spoke of the Ballets Russes in terms of both “enchantement’, ‘bouleversement’ and ‘fantaisie’. Yet they also invoked metaphors of invasion, describing the company’s Parisian presence in terms of ‘assaut’ (onslaught) and ‘conquete’ (conquest).” The dual-faceted relationship can be seen in this expression of both enrapture and contention. One French journalist, Maurice Lefevre, called on his fellow Parisians to see the reality of the Russian invasion as though it was an infestation, “We need to do some soul-searching and ask whether our guests are not about to become our masters.” To imply that Russia was about to take over France through performing arts seems to be irrational, but evidence would suggest the fears were real among those in Paris.\n\nThe first ballet company was the Imperial School of Ballet in St. Petersburg in the 1740s. Sergey Diaghilev, (1872-1929), an enormously important figure in the Russian ballet scene, founded the ballet company Ballets Russes in the 1909. Diaghilev intervened in every aspect of ballet - direction, production, lighting, scenery, and performance. He headquartered his ballet company in Paris. A protégé of Diaghilev, George Balanchine, founded the New York City Ballet in 1948. Today, the Kirov Ballet company (now known as the Mariinsky Ballet) and the Bolshoi company are two world-renowned Russian ballet companies that tour the world.\n\nOther Russian ballet companies include:\n\n\nA number of companies have been called, or included in their name, \"Moscow Ballet\".\n\nSeveral methods exist in Russian ballet. The most widely used is the Vaganova method, named after the ballerina and teacher, Agrippina Vaganova.\n\nMany Russian dancers have gone on to reach worldwide acclaim; notable Russian dancers include: \n\n\n\n"}

Salimbene was a follower of Joachim de Fiore, and a believer in his apocalyptic teachings. Salimbene joined the Franciscan order in 1238 at the friary of Fano.\n\nHe then led a life of wandering, avoiding his father who did not wish him to join the Order, and visited Pisa and other Italian towns; then in 1247 he was sent to Lyon, and visited Paris, Ferrara Cremona, Troyes, Florence, Ravenna, Genoa, Reggio and the friary of Montefalcone (near San Polo d'Enza in the region of Emilia-Romagna). The last was the probable site of his death.\n\nSalimbene's main work was his \"Cronica\" (\"Chronicle\"), covering the years 1167–1287. It was begun around 1282 and begins with the founding of Alessandria. His extensive travels meant that he met many important people of the time including Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, Louis IX of France and Pope Innocent IV. He also describes everyday life vividly and gives unrivalled detail into internal disputes in the Franciscan order at the time.\n\nHe also wrote \"The Twelve Calamities of Emperor Frederick II\" and several treatises now lost. \"The Twelve Calamities\" is set up as a kind of servant's narrative (Exempla, examples), made to demonstrate the faults of Frederick II - often with loosely fitted biblical quotations. One of the major themes of the work is Salimbene's emphasis on numerology. The chronicle itself is set up to demonstrate the parallel between the ten plagues and the ten calamities of Frederick II (conveniently he tacked on the last two after the parallel). Emphasizing the Christian nature of his narrative and the non-Christian nature of Frederick, Salimbene turns a phrase used during the crusades claiming that “if he had been a good Catholic and had loved God, the Church, and his own soul, he would scarcely have had an equal as an emperor in the world.”\n\n\n"}

Each sheet depicts a \"kabuki\" actor as a samurai, and belongs to a series of prints celebrating illustrious figures in Japan's martial tradition. The print belongs to the permanent collection of the Prince Takamado Gallery of Japanese Art in the Royal Ontario Museum, Canada.\n\n\nThe prints are taken from the print series , which is translated as \"Tales of Brave Warriors of Renown\" or \"Tales of Renowned Heroes.\" Hirosada produced multiple albums of this type including over one hundred heroic warrior images as single sheets and polytychs, including (\"Tales of Loyalty and Filial Devotion\") also issued in 1848. Doesburg has argued that such print collections reflect an attempt to circumvent censorship of kabuki-themed \"ukiyo-e\" under the Tenpō Reforms by cloaking the dramatic content in titles that imply the promotion of moral values and \"suggesting that the portraits were actually representations of famous men and women from history and legend.\" Although these images date from the period immediately after the easing of the Tenpō restrictions, they appear to be riding this trend.\n\nThe scene in this diptych is taken from the play . Originally written in 1780 for the \"ningyō jōruri\" puppet theatre by , and , the play was soon adapted for the kabuki stage. The seventh act, commonly referred to as \"Ageya\", is still performed on a regular basis.\n\nMade up of eleven acts, the play is part historical drama and part contemporary drama. It recounts the story of the Keian Uprising of 1651 led by (d. 1651), a commoner who rose to prominence as an expert swordsman and martial artist. Frustrated by the increasingly strict regulations placed on the samurai, Yui and a small band of \"rōnin\" attempted to stage a coup against the ruling Tokugawa shogunate. The plot was discovered, Yui arrested and ultimately allowed to commit \"seppuku\" ritual suicide. The other section of the play tells the story of a revenge plot hatched by two long-lost sisters. Reunited in an Edo brothel, the two women plan to exact vengeance on the evil samurai who killed their farmer father.\n\nThe diptych is taken from a performance of the play which was staged in the eighth month of 1848 at Osaka's Kado Theatre.\nThe diptych depicts two samurai facing each other in dramatic combative poses. They both wear \"waraji\" straw sandals, dark blue thigh-length kimono, and light blue \"obi\" tied casually around their waists. Both figures have \"chonmage\" topknots and carry two swords tucked into their \"obi\". The figure on the left stands in an active pose with one foot off the ground. With his right hand he raises a sword over his head, and in his left he profers an \"ōgi\" folding fan with writing—possibly a poem—on it. The figure on the right wears a more elaborate kimono, which includes a \"haori\" jacket decorated with a flower \"kamon\" family crest on the sleeve and shoulder. He stands with his legs widely and firmly planted, about to grab his sword.\n\nThe scene takes place outdoors against the backdrop of pinetrees. Like the sky and ground which are grey with no detail, the trees appear simply as silhouettes. Among the trees in the background is the shadow of a building with a traditional thatched roof. On the ground between the two figures is a fire.\n\nBorn in 1812, Rikan III began his stage career appearing with his father's travelling actor troupe. As a youth, however, he began studying kabuki under the head of the Arashi Rikan family, Rikan II. He performed very frequently on the Osaka, Edo and Kyoto stages. although especially praised for his \"tachiyaku\" (male heores) and \"onnagata\" female roles, he has been described as \"an outstanding kaneru yakusha,\" which is to say he was capable of performing a wide variety of both male and female roles. He was particularly praised for his powerful physique and voice, as well as his \"shamisen\" playing. Rikan III remained active on the stage until his death in 1863. He is buried on the grounds of Hōzenji Temple in the Dōtombori entertainment district of Osaka.\nBorn in Edo in 1791, Ebizō was the son of a \"shibai jaya\" (theatre tea-house) owner and grandson of Ichikawa Danjūrō V, one of the biggest kabuki stars of his day. He first appeared on the stage in 1794 at the age of three, and went on to become an \"outstanding tachiyaku [actor of male roles] and the most popular actor of the nineteenth century.\" He is described as \"highly original\", and as being particularly skilled at performing multiple roles within the same play and the requistite quick changes.\n\nEbizō V gained infamy in the summer of 1842 when he was found to be in violation of the restrictive sumptuary laws imposed through the Tempō Reforms. He was arrested and temporarily banished from Edo to Kamigata on the grounds that his ostentatious lifestyle was deemed to be irreconcilable with the Tokugawa bakufu's call for modesty and frugality. He was able to return seven years later, and had a very active career until his death in 1859. His sons continued his tradition, and both the Danjūrō and Ebizō lines continue to this day.\n\nGosōtei Hirosada's works are categorized as , a term used to distinguish prints produced in the Kamigata area (Kyoto and Osaka) from those produced in Edo. Gaining prominence about a century after the emergence of \"ukiyo-e\" in Edo, \"kamigata-e\" were predominantly (images of \"kabuki\" actors), and were produced almost exclusively by amateur “talented kabuki fans” promoting their favourite actors.\n\nLiterally 'kabuki pictures', \"kabuki-e\" began to be produced in Edo in the late seventeenth century. As kabuki grew in popularity, stars emerged, which in turn led to the (actor print) subgenre. Further subgenres of \"yakusha-e\" include bust portraits, full-length portraits, parody pictures, and death portraits.\n\n"}

His Ukrainian father, Ivan Danchenko, was an officer in the Imperial Russian army, and his mother, Alexandra Yagubyan (1829–1914), was Armenian. He went to high school in Tbilisi, continuing his education at Moscow State University (physical-mathematical and juridical departments 1876–79). \n\nIn 1879 he left the University for the theatre, starting as a theatre critic, and in 1881, his first play \"Dog-rose\", which was staged in one year by Maly Theatre, was published. \nHe was a teacher of Moskvin, Knipper and Meyerhold. \n\nIn 1919, he established the Musical Theatre of the Moscow Art Theatre, which was reformed into the Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre in 1926. In 1943 Nemirovich-Danchenko established the Moscow Art Theatre School, which is still extant. \n\nHe died of a heart attack on 25 April 1943, aged 84, in Moscow.\n\nNemirovich-Danchenko's Moscow Art Theatre staged Chekhov and Gorky drama with theretofore unknown naturalism and full expression. In addition, his theatre presented highly acclaimed Dostoevsky and Tolstoy dramatizations. It has been said that \"If Stanislavsky was the soul of Art Theatre, then Nemirovich was its heart\".\n\nNemirovich-Danchenko created the Moscow Art Theatre's acting and directing style, known for \"actors ensemble\" and its \"atmosphere\". Because of his directorial and production skills, the Moscow Art Theatre was considered, at the time, the best theatre in the world. But Nemirovich didn't write down his acting \"system\"and we know only the \"system of Stanislavski\". He was one of the first recipients of the title of People's Artist of the USSR in 1936. Later, he was awarded the USSR State Prize (1942, 1943), the Order of Lenin (3 May 1937), and Order of the Red Banner of Labour (25 February 1936).\n\n\n"}

Examples range from the academic to sporting and more frivolous events. The term is of British origin and has spread to other Commonwealth countries outside North America.\n\nThe wooden spoon was presented originally at the University of Cambridge as a kind of booby prize awarded by the students to the man who achieved the lowest exam marks but still earned a third-class degree (a \"junior optime\") in the Mathematical Tripos. The term \"wooden spoon\" or simply \"the spoon\" was also applied to the recipient, and the prize became quite notorious:\n\nThe spoons themselves, actually made of wood, grew larger, and in latter years measured up to five feet long. By tradition, they were dangled in a teasing way from the upstairs balcony in the Senate House, in front of the recipient as he came before the Vice-Chancellor to receive his degree, at least until 1875 when the practice was specifically banned by the University.\n\nThe lowest placed students earning a second-class (\"senior optime\") or first-class degree (\"wrangler\") were sometimes known as the \"silver spoon\" and \"golden spoon\" respectively. In contrast, the highest-scoring male student was named the \"senior wrangler\". Students unfortunate enough to place below the wooden spoon, by achieving only an Ordinary degree, were given a variety of names depending on their number. In the 1860s about three-quarters of the roughly 400 candidates did not score enough to be awarded honours, and were known as \"poll men\".\n\nThe custom dates back at least to the late 18th century, being recorded in 1803, and continued until 1909. From 1910 onwards the results have been given in alphabetical rather than score order, and so it is now impossible to tell who has come last, unless there is only one person in the lowest class.\n\nThe last wooden spoon was awarded to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club of St John's College, Cambridge, in 1909 at the graduation ceremony in the University's Senate House. The handle is shaped like an oar and inscribed with an epigram in Greek which may be translated as follows:\nIn Honours Mathematical,\nThis is the very last of all\nThe Wooden Spoons which you see here;\nO you who see it, shed a tear.\nAlternatively:\n\nThis wooden object is the last souvenir of the competitive examinations in mathematics. Look upon it, and weep.\nThe last spoon to be awarded is now in the possession of St. John's College, with an earlier version being kept at the Selwyn College Library. From 8 June 2009 to 26 June 2009, St. John's College held an exhibition of the five surviving wooden spoons in College hands, from St. John's (the last one, dating from 1909), Selwyn's (1906), Emmanuel's (1889) and Corpus Christi's (1895 and 1907) in its library to mark the centenary of the \"awarding\" of the last spoon of all. There are five known wooden spoons in private hands.\n\nHow the Cambridge wooden spoon idea came to be used in rugby union is not exactly known, but in the early years of what is now the Six Nations Championship there were many Cambridge graduates playing, so they may have attempted to preserve the concept after the last one was awarded in 1909. It is certain, in any case, that the tradition first arose in Cambridge and rugby adopted and perpetuated the tradition. In 1894 the \"South Wales Daily Post\" remarked that within the Home Nations Championships the Ireland-Wales match has been to decide which team should be recipient of the ignominious Wooden Spoon; one of the earliest mentions of the term within rugby union.\n\nThe term is commonly used in Australian and New Zealand sporting competitions, most notably in the major Australian rules, soccer, rugby league and rugby union leagues (such as the AFL, the A-League, NRL, Super Rugby and ITM Cup) and refers to the club positioned last on the league table at the end of the season.\n\nThe Sydney Thunder won the wooden spoon in the first three Big Bash League seasons between the 2011–12 and 2013–14 seasons, before Brisbane Heat became the first team other than the Thunder to finish last in the eight-team competition, in 2014–15.\n\nA wooden spoon, also known as the \"anti-slam\", is sometimes spoken about in tennis. It is described as the worst possible outcome in a tournament, applying to the player for whom the following scenario becomes true:\n\n\nSome notable Grand Slam \"wooden spooners\" include, among others, Goran Ivanišević (1995 Australian Open), Mary Pierce (2002 Australian Open), Marat Safin (2004 US Open), Caroline Wozniacki (2007 French Open), Ana Ivanovic (2010 Wimbledon Championships), Rafael Nadal (2016 Australian Open), Jelena Janković (2016 French Open) and Jelena Ostapenko (2018 French Open - Jelena Ostapenko was the defending champion, being crowned in 2017).\n\nGreg Rusedski (1994 and 1995 US Open, 2006 Wimbledon Championships), Nicolás Lapentti (1996 French Open, 1997 and 2009 Wimbledon Championships) and Julien Benneteau (2014 and 2016 US Open, 2016 French Open) can claim three wooden spoons throughout their career.\n\nMajor League Soccer\n\nIn Major League Soccer, the last place team in the overall standings is generally considered as the \"wooden spoon champion\". However, unlike other Wooden Spoon awards, there is an actual \"trophy\" for the award. Before the start of the 2016 MLS season, the Independent Supporter's Council decided to create an official \"trophy\" for the lowest place team in the league, as a complement to the Supporters Shield which the ISC also manages. The trophy is passed to the “winning” team at the annual ISC Conference, and the holders of the Spoon must possess the spoon for the entire following season. At the end of the year every group awarded the Wooden Spoon are allowed to do what they will with the trophy. The Chicago Fire Soccer Club were the “winner” of the inaugural 2015 wooden spoon and their supporters had the responsibility of creating the first spoon.\n\nIn the Cambridge and Oxford Bumps races, a crew who get bumped each day (thus moving down four places) are awarded spoons. This is probably related to the use of wooden spoons as a booby prize in the University of Cambridge Mathematical Tripos.\n\n\n"}

His sister was \"Leult\" Ijigayehou Asfa Wossen, his grandfather was \"Ras\" Seyum Mengesha, and his wife was \"Woizero\" Alem Tsehai Araya. He received his rudimentary education in Addis Ababa under a tutor and went to school in Jerusalem and Cairo respectively where his mother, stayed during the Fascist occupation of Ethiopia. After the liberation, he enrolled at the Haile Selassie I secondary school in Addis Ababa and subsequently joined the University of Exeter, England, where he studied English literature. This was followed by legal training at St. Anthony's College, Oxford where he became a senior member of the college from 1963 to 1971. At the conclusion of which he was called to the Bar, Lincoln's Inn, London. After a long interval, during which he held various public offices in Ethiopia, he returned to Oxford and earned his PhD in the composite field of history, politics and economics.\n\nSince his return home in the early 1950s, he held various offices, including that of deputy prime minister.\n\nUnder the imperial government he held the following positions:\nIn November 1974, the Provisional Military Administrative Council's (Derg) summary execution of high government officials of the previous regime force Zewde to go into exile. He eventually became vice-president of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and subsequently worked for several years as advisor to the secretariat of the United Nations. Throughout his service, he received national honors from at least seven sovereign states, including the Federal Republic of Germany. Together with some prominent Ethiopians, he tried to mediate between Ethiopia and Eritrea 1998.\n\nScholars of African history often compare the passing away of a knowledgeable person to a library consumed by conflagration. That is precisely what happened when the Ethiopian luminary, Dr. \"Dejazmatch\" Zewde Gebre-Sellassie, died of illness in Addis Ababa 15 December 2008. He harmoniously combined oral tradition with profound western education; and, he readily availed of them to any academic who sought his assistance. His popularity among all walks of life was immense. His funeral, which took place at the patriotic cemetery of the Trinity Cathedral, was attended by a huge crowd of mourners. The lawyer, \"Ato\" Tasoma Gebre Mariam who read out the eulogy, praised him for his contribution in making of the various Ethiopian codes of law. A week-long exhibition of his works and photos, accompanied by speeches of scholars and family members, was also held in his memory at the main campus of Addis Ababa University.\n\n\n \n"}

His main interests are ancient water technology, ancient roof terracottas, Roman social history, Etruscan archaeology and epigraphy.\n\nFrom 1963, Wikander studied Classical Archaeology and Ancient History, History, History of Art, and Classical Languages at Lund University. He received his BA in 1967 and PhD in 1980, both at Lund.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1981, Wikander worked as a curator at the Greek and Roman department of the Medelhavsmuseet (\"Mediterranean Museum\") in Stockholm. From 1981, he has been on the staff of the Department of Classics and the Department of Archaeology at the University of Lund. From 1985 to 1991, he held the position as researcher in ancient technology at the Swedish Research Council of Humanities. He was appointed professor at Lund University in 2001 and retired in 2008.\n\nWikander took part in the Swedish excavations at Acquarossa, Etruria in 1968–1975, 1978 and 1991. For shorter periods, he excavated at Uppåkra, Sweden (1968), Val Beretta, Etruria (1972, 1974), and in the Baths of Caracalla, Rome (1980).\n\nAs of 2011, Wikander has published five books and more than 120 scholarly and popular articles and reviews. He has been the editor or co-editor of four conference acta and handbooks.\n\nWikander, basing his argument on the constantly increasing archaeological evidence for ancient watermills, makes a case for the breakthrough of watermilling occurring much earlier than previously thought, possibly already in the first century A.D. The wide distribution of watermill sites indicates that this labour-saving technology was adopted throughout the empire and must have had a significant impact on the late Roman economy. The relative lack of ancient written evidence compared to the medieval period is rather due to the general urban focus of ancient authors, while the watermill was primarily a rural phenomenon. \n\nWikander's studies of ancient architectural terracottas are focused around the development of tiled roofs in Archaic Etruria. By detailed publications of the entire tile material from some of the most important sites (Acquarossa, San Giovenale, Poggio Civitate), he has been able to present a general systematization of the early typological development in the area, together with a description of its basic technological prerequisites. He is also working on the publication of parts of the monumental zone at Acquarossa.\n\nWikander's prosopographical studies of senators and equites aim at a better understanding of the connections – economic and other – between the two leading classes of the Roman Republic. His basic hypothesis is that these contacts, often confirmed by marriage alliances, were far closer than generally acknowledged. \n\nTogether with his late wife Charlotte, Wikander has put in order the notes and documents concerning Etruscan inscriptions assembled by Olof August Danielsson during his preparations for the Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum (CIE) between 1886 and 1933. One substantial result of this work has been the publication of addenda and corrigenda to CIE II,1,4. \n\n\n"}
