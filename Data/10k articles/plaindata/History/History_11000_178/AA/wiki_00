It took almost another fifty years when his brother Hadrian re-edited the work of Anonymus in the edition of Ammianus Marcellinus in 1681. It was the first time when Excerpta Valesiana, that is the edition of the Pars Posterior was clearly separated from other fragments.\n\nThe texts exist only in a single ninth-century manuscript in Berlin. The collection later turned up in the Jesuit \"Collège de Clermont\" in Paris. The parchment bundle, originally consisted of 34 flimsy layers – a manuscript prepared by nine different hands – was later ordered and attached together according to the hands. The collection appeared in the catalogue of the Jesuit college at the occasion of the sale of the library by auction in 1764. The collection was sold and transferred to a certain Johannes Meermann (\"Codex Meermannus\" 794) in the Hague. Following the death of Meermann, the collection was possessed by an English collector Sir Thomas Phillipps (\"Codex Phillippsianus 1885\"). Later, through the heirs, it was taken by the German State Library in Berlin in 1887 where it is accessible today under the shelf-mark: ‘\"Ms. Phill. 1885’\". They are sometimes referred to as the Excerpta Valesiani.\n\nThe work of the Anonymus Valesianus is a debated issue of historiography for more than one hundred years, all the more so as both the identity of the author and the circumstances of the compilation of the work are obscure.\n\n\"Anonymus Valesianus\" I, sometimes given the separate conventional title Origo Constantini Imperatoris (\"The Lineage of the Emperor Constantine\") possibly dates from around 390, and is generally regarded as providing a reliable source. The beginning of Origo already looks like the final sentence of an account on the rule of Diocletian and Maximian. In 1963 Arnaldo Momigliano summarized the results of scholarship on Origo Constantini in the words that \"“All is in doubt about the first part of the Anonymus Valesianus”.\" There are questions left, with regard to the date of Origo’s editions, sources, and revisions, which have not yet found convincing answers.\n\n\"Anonymus Valesianus\" II, sometimes referred to as the Pars Posterior, written after 526 and probably between 540 and 550. The text, which mostly deals with the reign of the Gothic king in Italy, Theodoric the Great. The identity of the author and the circumstances of the compilation of the Pars Posterior is obscure, however a few scholars think it \"based on a no longer extant chronicle by the bishop of Ravenna, Maximianus\".\n\nThe Pars Posterior consists of 60 chapters and it presents the chain of events as a chronicle from Chapter 36 to 59: from the rule of Emperor Zeno, through the decline of the power of Odoacer, up to the succession of Theodoric the Great in 493. In the next section, from Chapter 60 to 79, the description of the rule of Theodoric the Great – the Italian ruler of Germanic origin – can be found. Besides the description of political events the author dwells on portraying the major virtues of the ruler through different narratives. In the closing section (Chapter 80 to 96) the author describes the tragic years of Theodoric's rule.\n\nThe work was used by Edward Gibbon as a major source for the Roman perspective on the Ostrogothic period in his \"History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\".\n\n\n"}

Woodbury (1899 near Spencer, in the Hawkesbury Valley of New South Wales – 1979) was an Australian Catholic philosopher.\n\nWoodbury joined the Marist Fathers and gained a doctorate in Rome, studying under the scholastic philosopher Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange. In 1945, he founded the Aquinas Academy in Sydney, a school of philosophy aimed mainly at lay people. He headed the Academy until 1975, teaching a strictly scholastic philosophy based on the teaching of Thomas Aquinas. A combative personality, he was often in conflict with the atheist Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney, John Anderson, whom Austin believed was corrupting Sydney's youth. Woodbury died in 1979.\n\nThe Aquinas Academy:\n\nThe Aquinas Academy was set up under the auspices of the Australian Province of the Marist Fathers by Fr Austin Woodbury SM in March 1945. The Academy began as a centre for the study of Philosophy and Theology in the Thomistic tradition. For some twenty-nine years it continued in this capacity under Fr Woodbury's guidance, in premises at the back of St Patrick's Church, Gloucester Street, in The Rocks (Sydney, NSW). For a short while the Academy offered a License in Philosophy under accreditation from the University of St Thomas in Rome. Since its inception, a number of qualified priests, religious and laity have been part of the lecturing staff. The Academy was one of the pioneers of Catholic adult education in Australia.\n\nSince 1975, the Academy has increasingly focused on general adult education in the faith. Perhaps the most popular of the programs mounted was the Christian Growth Program, offering basic education in theology, morality, psychology and spirituality. During this time the Academy also developed a State-accredited program for religious education teachers, offering a Certificate in Religious Studies. In these years, also, a wide array of seminars, special lecture series, summer schools and workshops were offered – with presenters from Australia and overseas. All these programs were designed to contribute in some way to adult education in the faith. One of the features of the Academy during these latter years has been its mobility – programs have been offered at various centres in and around Sydney and along the eastern seaboard.\n\nFormer Principals, Fr Kevin Bates SM and Fr John Thornhill SM with one of the Students to graduate with a Licentiate from the University of St Thomas through the Aquinas Academy, Sr Celestine Pooley RSM\nFollowing the major renovations to the St Patrick’s Church and the surrounding buildings (1998-2001), the Aquinas Academy is now housed on the third and fourth floors – Levels 5 and 7 – of the building at 141 Harrington Street that for many years was St Patrick's Business College. The first and second floors of that same building are used for parish meeting rooms and offices.\n\nAquinas Academy continues a significant commitment to adult education in the faith, still under the auspices of the Australian Province of the Marist Fathers. Together with the Marists, a number of other priests, religious and laity continue to serve the community through the Academy. Aquinas Academy today continues its commitment to adult education within the Catholic tradition to assist people seeking to develop a mature faith. Situated in Sydney's central business district, the Academy aims most particularly to become a school of spirituality in the heart of the city.\n\nFr Michael Whelan SM is currently the Director of the Academy.

A nuclear weapon creates a shock wave, which may produce sudden pressure changes of more than an atmosphere (about 1 bar or 15 pounds per square inch) even several kilometers or miles from the detonation point. After the shock wave passes, a sudden negative pressure follows.\n\nIf such pressure waves enter a shelter, they will likely do substantial harm to occupants and equipment. A blast valve is placed in air intake/exhaust pipes, that remains open normally, but automatically closes when strong pressure is applied in either direction. Blast dampers operate in the same fashion and are related or identical to blast valves, the former name however is generally used to describe blast mitigation devices, for more, conventional explosive events.\n\nA typical blast valve has entries of 150–300 mm diameter (6-12\"), and a larger center section. Within the center section is a disk mounted on an axle, with weak springs that keep it centered, away from both entries. Pressure displaces the disk along the axle, until it plugs one entry or the other. After the blast, the springs return the disk to the center, re-opening the valve.\n\nAnother type of blast valve employs rounded metal tubes held in place by springs. As pressure rises it pushes the tubes against the frame of the valve closing the opening. These valves are typically unidirectional in airflow and are employed in large wall structures where large amounts of airflow is required.\n\nOne form of blast valve, popularized by the book Nuclear War Survival Skills and tested by ORNL is worn flat rubber tire treads nailed or bolted to frames strong enough to resist the maximum overpressure, with tested closing times cited as being identical to commercial grade blast valves, however the use of this form of blast valve design must also take the risk of the flammable rubber catching fire into consideration.\n"}

Bliss (1897–1985) was a chemical engineer and semiotician, and the inventor of Blissymbolics. He was born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and later gained Australian citizenship.\n\nBliss was born Karl Kasiel Blitz, the eldest of four children to Michel Anchel and Jeanette Blitz, in Chernivtsi in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (current Ukraine). The family were impoverished and the senior Blitz supported the family as an optician, mechanic, and wood turner.\n\nLater on Bliss said that the symbols on his father's circuit diagrams made instant sense to him. They were a \"logical language\". He was similarly impressed by chemical symbols, which he thought could be read by anyone, regardless of their mother tongue.\n\nBliss's early life was difficult. It was cold and his family were poor and hungry. Because the family was Jewish, he suffered anti-Semitic taunts.\n\nWhen Bliss was eight years old, Russia lost the Russo-Japanese War, Russian pogroms against the Jews accelerated, and refugees came into Bliss's town from the nearby Russian town of Kishinev. Also in 1905 Bliss saw a slide show of the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition of Weyprecht and Payer. It inspired him to study engineering to improve technology for ordinary people.\n\nBliss graduated from the Vienna University of Technology as a chemical engineer in 1922. He joined Telefunken, a German television and radio apparatus company, and rose to be chief of the patent department.\n\nIn March 1938, the Third Reich annexed Austria via the Anschluss, and Bliss, as a Jew, was sent to Dachau concentration camp. Later. he was moved to Buchenwald concentration camp. His wife, Claire, a German Catholic, made constant efforts to have him released. He was released but was required to leave the country for England immediately. In England, Bliss tried to bring his wife to him, but the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 made that impossible. It was there that, because the Nazi bombing of England was called the \"blitz,\" he changed his surname to Bliss.\n\nBliss arranged for Claire to escape Germany via his family in Czernowitz, Romania (now called Chernivtsi and in the Ukraine). Needing to leave there, Claire moved on to Greece and safety, until October 1940 when Italy invaded Greece. The couple were reunited on Christmas Eve 1940, after Claire continued east to Shanghai and Charles went west to Shanghai via Canada and Japan.\n\nAfter the Japanese occupied Shanghai, Bliss and his wife were placed into the Hongkew ghetto. Claire, as a German and a Christian had the option of claiming her German citizenship, applying for a divorce and being released. She did not do so but accompanied Bliss into the ghetto.\n\nIn Shanghai, Bliss became interested in Chinese characters, which he mistakenly thought were ideograms. He studied them and learned how to read shop signs and Chinese newspapers. With some astonishment, he one day realised that he had been reading the symbols off not in Chinese, but in his own language, German. With ideograms for his inspiration, Bliss set out to develop a system of writing by pictures. At that time Bliss had not become aware of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's \"Universal Symbolism\".\n\nBliss and his wife migrated to Australia after the war, reaching Australia in July 1946. His semiotic ideas met with universal rejection. Bliss, without any Australian or Commonwealth qualifications had to work as a labourer to support his family. He worked on his system of symbols at night. Bliss and his wife became Australian citizens.\n\nOriginally Bliss had called his system \"World Writing\" because the aim was to establish a series of symbols that would be understood by all, regardless of language. Bliss then decided an English-language name was too restricted and called the system Semantography. In Sydney in 1949 Bliss published the three-volume \"International Semantography: A non-alphabetical Symbol Writing readable in all languages\". There was no great positive reaction. For the next four years Claire Bliss sent 6,000 letters to educators and universities, to no better effect.\n\nBliss's wife died in 1961 after years of ill health.\n\nIn 1965 Bliss published a second edition of his work, \"Semantography (Blissymbolics)\".\n\nIt was about this time that the increase in international tourism convinced many that only a pictorial symbol language could be understood by all. Bliss made sure his idea was attached to his name, hence Blissymbolics.\n\nIn 1971, Bliss learned that since 1965, a particular centre in Canada had been using his symbols to teach children with cerebral palsy to communicate. He was thrilled at first, but he became horrified when he learned that the center had extended his set of symbols and was using the symbols as a bridge to help the children learn to use spoken and written words in a traditional language, which were far from his vision for Blissymbolics. He badgered and eventually sued the center, at one time even threatening a nurse with imprisonment. After ten years of constant attacks from Bliss, the center came to a compromise with Bliss because it felt the publicity he drew to be bringing a bad name to the center. The world copyright for use of his symbols with handicapped children was licensed to the Blissymbolics Communication Foundation in Canada.\n\nBliss was made a Member of the Order of Australia (A.M.) in 1976 for \"services to the community, particularly to handicapped children\". \n\nOn the basis of the recognition of the innovative nature of his work, Bliss was appointed an Honorary Fellow in Linguistics at the Australian National University, by the (then) Head of the ANU School of Linguistics, Professor Bob Dixon, in 1979.\n\n\n\n\n"}

By 2004, CONSOL Energy had donated a vast collection of records, survey books, photographs, and mining maps. Overall, the collection has grown to over 8,000 individual map sheets relating to mines operated by CONSOL Energy and its corporate subsidiaries throughout Southwestern Pennsylvania in Allegheny, Westmoreland, Washington, Greene, Fayette, and Somerset Counties. The maps are needed for mine safety, transportation planning, mine subsidence insurance. The program often consults with homeowners and developers building new properties or dealing with mine subsidence. The preservation of historic mine maps took on increased importance following the Quecreek Mine Rescue in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, where the rescue was hampered by faulty maps.\n\nIn 2009, the project received $100,000 to be paid over five years from CONSOL Energy, $75,000 from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and $25,000 from the Office of Surface Mining.\n\nThe collection dates between 1854 and 2002, with most maps dating between 1880 and 1940. The project preservation and digitization efforts are focused on roughly 700 “hardback” maps, which are drafted by hand on heavyweight paper adhered to canvas. The hardback maps are generally oversized, sometimes 5 feet tall and 10 to 30 feet long. These maps, which were used as the \"master copies\" for other map reproductions, are generally considered the most complete, and sometimes the exclusive map of some abandoned mines.\n\nIn 2007, University Library System staff members began the process of surveying, cleaning, and repairing the maps in order to stabilize them. Maps are dry cleaned with soot sponges to remove surface dirt.\nThe canvas backing of the maps are vacuumed; those with significant damage are repaired with muslin patches and an Ethylene vinyl acetate adhesive. In order to unroll brittle maps, some of which haven't been opened in over 100 years, the conservator and student assistants use a process of humidification, flattening, and drying to safely open the maps without causing additional damage. First, the maps are placed in a large humidity dome. After 5 or 6 hours of absorbing humidity the maps can be safely unrolled. The maps dry flat between polyester webbing and wool felts overnight. The majority of student assistants performing the preservation work are enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences. Next, the maps are transferred to the Office of Surface Mining National Mine Map Repository in Green Tree, Pennsylvania, where they are catalogued and scanned into a digital format. The scanning process uses an overhead Cruse scanner that has a suction table for maps that do not lay flat. The scanned image files are recorded in .tiff file format. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection office in California, Pennsylvania prepares then the digital files for use in geographic information system programs for use within the Pennsylvania Historical Underground Mine Maps Inventory System. The original maps are returned to University of Pittsburgh archives for permanent storage.\n\nThe information is proving useful to homeowners who live atop old mines, and even to developers of a new regional botanical garden.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1043779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1043779", "title": "Coram nobis", "text": "Coram nobis\n\nThe writ of coram nobis (also known as \"writ of error coram nobis\", \"writ of coram vobis\", or \"writ of error coram vobis\") is a legal order allowing a court to correct its original judgment upon discovery of a fundamental error that did not appear in the records of the original judgment's proceedings and would have prevented the judgment from being pronounced. The term \"coram nobis\" is Latin for \"before us\" and the meaning of its full form, \"quae coram nobis resident\", is \"which [things] remain in our presence\". The writ of coram nobis originated in the English court of common law in the English legal system during the sixteenth century.\n\nThe writ of coram nobis still exists today in a few courts in the United States. In 1907, the writ became obsolete in England and replaced by other means of correcting errors; however, the writ survives in the United States in various forms in the federal courts, in sixteen state courts, and the District of Columbia courts. For those courts with the authority to issue a writ of coram nobis, the rules and guidelines differ – sometimes significantly. Each state is free to operate its own coram nobis procedures independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system. In other words, the criteria required to issue the writ in one state (or federal) court system are different from the criteria required to issue the writ in a different court system. A writ can be granted only by the court where the original judgment was entered, so those seeking to correct a judgment must understand the criteria required for that specific court.\n\nThe \"writ of error coram nobis\" originated in England over 500 years ago. The name of the writ combines three terms: writ, writ of error, and coram nobis. Writ is an official written command. Writ of error provides a superior court the means to correct errors of a lower court. Writ of error coram nobis is a variation of the writ of error and provides a court the means to correct its own errors.\n\nSometime before the tenth century, officials in England began utilizing writs to convey orders. A \"writ\" was simply a short written command issued by a person in authority. It was customary for the sender to seal this written command as proof of its authenticity. In the days when writing was a rare art, a writ was revered because the person receiving the command was unlikely to deny or question its legitimacy. The Norman Conquest of England in 1066 led to the establishment of a strong, centralized monarchy. The first Norman King of England, William the Conqueror, modified writs to become mainly framed in Latin, increased the number of writs to cover additional royal commands, and established the \"Curia Regis \" in England. The \"Curia Regis\", a Latin term meaning \"royal council\", consisted of the King of England and his loyal advisors. The \"Curia Regis\" accompanied the King as he travelled. This council administered all of the King's governmental activities, including judicial matters.\n\nOne of the most important members of the \"Curia Regis\" was the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor led the chancery. Chancery is a general term for a medieval writing office that was responsible for the production of official documents. The Lord Chancellor wrote writs on behalf of the King, maintained all official documents, and acted as the keeper of the royal seal. This position, in effect, placed the Lord Chancellor as the head of the English legal system. The King, however, was the ultimate leader of the kingdom; therefore, the Lord Chancellor issued writs under the guidance of what he believed to be the best interests of the King. Between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Lord Chancellor had a large control over issuance of all original writs. An original writ began a legal proceeding, while a judicial writ was issued during a legal proceeding.\n\nOne such \"original\" writ was the writ of error. In medieval England, the word \"appeal\" was not the term used to describe a request to review the legality of a lower court's decision. Instead, a \"petition of error\" requested higher courts to review the legality of an order or sentence. Petitioners brought a petition of error before the Lord Chancellor. Due to his position and close relationship with the law, the Lord Chancellor could naturally determine if the petition provided sufficient evidence of an error and, if so, the type of writ most appropriate to correct the error. If a lower court committed an error of law, the Lord Chancellor would issue a writ of error. A writ of error required the lower court to deliver the \"records\" of the case to a superior court where the court reviewed the case for legal errors. Because a writ of error was only available for a higher court to determine if a lower court committed an error of law, courts needed another type of writ to correct its own decision upon an error of fact. To rectify this issue, the Lord Chancellor created a new writ - the writ of error coram nobis. Thus, the original writ of coram nobis provided the means to correct errors that the writ of error could not correct. Unlike the writ of error, the writ of coram nobis:\n\n“Coram nobis” is Latin for “before us”. Initially, when the Lord Chancellor issued orders on behalf of the King and the royal court, the word “us” simply referred to the King, the Lord Chancellor, and other judges of this court. The royal court originated within the \"Curia Regis\", which began during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, under the realm of Henry the Second (Henry II). Henry II made writs available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice, thus initiating a vast expansion of writs within the common law. The increased demand of judicial maters before the \"Curia Regis\" in the twelfth century led to the establishment of two central courts: the Court of King's Bench and the Court of Common Pleas. These courts became the superior courts to all other courts in England, including local and tribunal courts such as the Hundred Courts and Court of Piepowders.\n\n\nOver time, the authority to issue writs shifted from the Lord Chancellor to the courts. Although the King was no longer part of the court issuing the writ, the name \"coram nobis\" continued because courts associated the name with its function rather than its original Latin meaning. Thus, in English law, the definition of \"coram nobis\" evolved and is now redefined as a remedy for a court to correct its own error.\n\nThe first case involving the writ of coram nobis is unknown due to incomplete historical records prior to the sixteenth century; however, the first recorded case involving the writ of coram nobis occurred in 1561 in the case of \"Sir Gilbert Debenham and Another v. Bateman\". Until 1705, the writ of error was originally a matter entirely up to the discretion of either the monarch or those with the authority to make decisions on behalf of the monarch; but in 1705, the court held that the writ was a matter of right instead of a matter of discretion. Despite making writs of error a matter of right, courts rarely used these writs because of their cumbersome and impractical procedure. A writ of error moved the record from the original court to a higher court; however, the record only contained information on the arraignment, the plea, the issue, and the verdict. The record did not include the most material parts of a trial, including the evidence and the judge's direction to the jury. As a result, England abolished all writs of error, including the writs of coram nobis and coram vobis, and replaced them with appellate procedures encompassing all rights previously available through these writs. Thus, the abolition of the writ of coram nobis in England was due mostly to administration difficulties with the writ of error, and not because of administration difficulties with the writ of coram nobis itself. The law abolishing the writ in civil cases was the Common Law Procedure Act 1852. The laws abolishing the writ in criminal cases was the Criminal Appeal Act of 1907.\n\nAfter arriving in North America in the seventeenth century, English settlers established English colonies. Within these colonies, the settlers created colonial courts that adhered to the English legal system and issued writs in the same manner as English courts. After the United States obtained independence from England, state governments, as well as the federal government, provided courts the authority to continue to rely upon writs as a source of law unless issuing the writ violated the state or federal constitution or if either the state or federal government subsequently enacted a statute restricting the writ. The purpose of allowing courts to issue writs was to fill a void whenever the state constitution, state statutes, the U.S. Constitution or federal statutes did not address an issue to be decided before the court. Writs were especially important when the federal government, as well as each state, first established its judicial system. During those times, there were very few (if any) statutes or case laws for courts to rely upon as guidance. In those circumstances, the English writs provided fledgling federal and state courts an important source of law.\nOver time, writs became significantly less important as Congress and state legislatures enacted more statutes and further defined rules for its judiciary. Writs also evolved independently in the federal judicial system and each state's judicial system so that a writ within one judicial systems may have a vastly different purpose and procedures from the same writ in other judicial systems. Different characteristics of a writ from one judicial system to another is the result of the federal system of government prescribed within the United States Constitution. Federalism in the United States is a mixed system of government that combines a national federal government and state governments. While federal courts are superior to state courts in federal matters, the Constitution limits the reach of federal courts; thereby, providing state courts general sovereignty and law-making authority over a wider range of topics. This sovereignty allows each judicial system to decide whether to adopt writs and the function and purpose of each writ it adopts. Thus, the use and application of writs, including the writ of coram nobis, can vary within each of these judicial systems.\n\nLegislation authorizes a judicial system to issue the writ of coram under one of two conditions:\n\nIn 1789, Congress passed the Judiciary Act to establish the judicial courts in the United States. This Act also allows courts to issue writs, including the writ of coram nobis. Originally, federal courts applied the writ of coram nobis only to correct technical errors, such as those made by a clerk of the court in the records of the proceedings. The 1914 Supreme Court case \"United States v. Mayer\", expanded the scope of the writ of coram nobis to include fundamental errors, but the Court declined in this case to decide whether federal courts are permitted to issue the writ of coram nobis. In 1954, the Supreme Court determined in \"United States v. Morgan\" that federal courts are permitted to issue the writ of coram nobis to correct fundamental errors, such as those where discovery of new information is sufficient to prove a convicted felon is actually innocent. Since the \"Morgan\" case, federal courts traditionally issue a writ of coram nobis whenever a former federal prisoner petitions the original sentencing court to set aside the conviction based upon new information that was not available when the petitioner was in-custody and where this new information demonstrates that the conviction was a result of a fundamental error.\n\nThe history of the writ of coram nobis in United States federal courts began in 1789 when Congress enacted the Judiciary Act. Under Section 14 of the Judiciary Act, federal courts have the authority to issue a writ whenever the court deems it necessary to achieve justice and whenever no congressional law covers the issues before the court. This section was known as the “All-Writs Provision” of the Judiciary Act until 1948 when it became more commonly known as the “All-Writs Act” after Congress modified the Judicial Code and consolidated this provision into . Under the All Writs Act, federal district courts have the “power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specifically provided for by statute.” Congress had not specifically provided by statute the authority for federal courts to issue a writ of coram nobis; therefore, the All Writs Act provides federal courts this authority.\n\nThe first case in a federal court to address the writ of coram nobis was \"Strode v. The Stafford Justices\" in 1810. In this case, the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the opinion in this Circuit Court case and held that the writ of coram nobis is distinguishable from the writ of error and therefore not subject to the writ of error's statute of limitations. The first Supreme Court case mentioning the writ of coram nobis (using the term coram vobis) is the 1833 case, \"Pickett's Heirs v. Legerwood\". In this case, the Court determined that the writ was available to correct its own errors, but the same remedy was also available using the preferred method of submitting a motion to the court. Eighty years later, in 1914, the Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in \"United States v. Mayer\".\nThus, while federal courts confirmed the writ of coram nobis was available to federal courts, this remedy was rarely necessary or appropriate in federal courts throughout the nineteenth century for the following two reasons:\n\nIn 1946, Congress amended the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in federal civil cases. Prior to enactment of these amendments, Congress reviewed all relief previously provided for civil cases through the writ of coram nobis and adopted those avenues of relief into the rules; therefore, eliminating the need for the writ in federal civil cases. In the amendment, Congress expressly abolished the writ of coram nobis in Rule 60(b). Later, in 2007, Congress restructured the format of Rule 60, and moved the language expressly abolishing the writ of coram nobis in civil proceedings from Rule 60(b) to Rule 60(e) in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nIn 1790, one year after Congress passed the Judiciary Act establishing federal courts, Congress enacted the Crimes Act which created the first comprehensive list of federal offenses. From 1790 until 1867, there are few, if any, records of individuals challenging a federal criminal conviction after completion of the prison sentence. Two primary reasons explains the absence of any challenges to a conviction by former federal prisoners:\n\nThe American Civil War is historically significant upon the rights of former federal prisoners in two ways. First, Congress enacted the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 to prevent abuses following the civil war. This Act expanded the writ of habeas corpus to any person, including former prisoners. Second, states began imposing more collateral consequences upon those convicted of crimes; thus, providing more reasons why a person would want to have a wrongful conviction overturned. The loss of voting privileges was one of the most significant collateral consequence of a felony conviction. In 1800, no state prohibited convicted felons from voting; but by end of the U.S. Civil War, nearly eighty percent of state legislatures had passed laws barring felons the right to vote.\n\nSlavery was legal in the United States until the 1860s. In the 1860 U.S. presidential election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, supported the elimination of slavery. This controversial issue was the catalyst for the American Civil War that began in 1861 following the election of Lincoln and concluded in 1865. On March 3, 1865, President Lincoln signed a joint resolution declaring wives and children of persons in the armed forces to be free; and on December 18, 1865 the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution became effective. This Amendment abolished slavery and involuntary servitude in the United States. The purpose of the Habeas Act was to provide \"what legislation is necessary to enable the courts of the United States to enforce the freedom of the wife and children of soldiers of the United States, and also to enforce the liberty of all persons.\"\n\nThe Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 expanded the jurisdiction of the writ of habeas corpus to any person. As a result, this act eliminated the writ of coram nobis in criminal cases because any person challenging a conviction, regardless of whether the person is in prison or not, could have raised the claim through the writ of habeas corpus.\n\nIn 1946, Congress abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases; and the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 provided a remedy for jurisdictional and constitutional errors at the trial at any time, regardless of whether the person was in prison or had completed their sentence. For all practical purposes, the writ of coram nobis had no purpose in federal courts. In fact, the Supreme Court commented on the writ of coram nobis in a 1947 case and determined \"it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where this writ would be necessary or appropriate.\" But, on June 25, 1948, Congress passed legislation that would lead to the resurrection of the writ. The Act of June 25, 1948 combined two pieces of legislation:\nDespite legislative intentions for §2255 to only change the jurisdiction of the district courts, the language of the statute restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. Consequently, former prisoners had no statutory avenue to challenge a conviction. As a result, this act indirectly resurrected the writ of coram nobis to former prisoners.\n\nThe Act of June 25, 1948 reworded the habeas corpus sections of the United States Code to provide only those individuals in-custody (as a result of a criminal conviction in federal court) access to the writ of habeas corpus. For those who had been convicted of a federal crime but were no longer in-custody, the question was whether the 1948 Act abolished all post-conviction review of a former prisoner's conviction.\n\nIn 1952 Robert Morgan, a former federal prisoner who had completed his sentence, petitioned to have his conviction overturned based on information he claimed to be unavailable at the time of his conviction. Although the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 would have allowed Morgan to challenge his conviction using the writ of habeas corpus, the Act of June 25, 1948 restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. The district court denied his petition because Morgan was no longer in custody for the conviction he sought to overturn. Morgan appealed that decision. In 1953, the appellate court disagreed with the district court and determined that the writ of coram nobis was available to Morgan. The government appealed the appellate court's decision to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe first question in \"United States v. Morgan\" was whether Congress intended to abolish any post-conviction remedies to former prisoners when it restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. If the Supreme Court decided that Congress did not intend to abolish any post-conviction remedies to former prisoners, then the second question in \"United States v. Morgan\" was whether the writ of coram nobis was available to challenge a conviction after completion of the petitioner's sentence. On January 4, 1954, the Supreme Court announced its decision. The Court first determined that Congress did not intend within the 1948 Act to eliminate all reviews of criminal convictions for petitioners who had completed their sentence. Although the 1948 Act restricted former prisoners from challenging a conviction with a writ of habeas corpus, the Court determined by reviewing the legislative notes that Congress did not intend to abolish post-conviction challenges to a sentence from former prisoners. Justice Stanley Reed, who authored the majority opinion for the Court, wrote;\n[T]he purpose of § 2255 was \"to meet practical difficulties\" in the administration of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction. [] Nowhere in the history of Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners' rights of collateral attack upon their convictions. We know of nothing in the legislative history that indicates a different conclusion. We do not think that the enactment of § 2255 is a bar to this motion, and we hold that the District Court has power to grant [the writ of coram nobis].\nAlthough Congress did exclude former prisoners from challenging a conviction through the writ of habeas corpus, the Court determined that the All Writs Act provides federal courts the authority to issue a writ of coram nobis to former prisoners whenever new evidence proves the underlying conviction was a result of a fundamental error. Thus, \"Morgan\" officially revived the writ of coram nobis as the sole means for post-incarceration judicial review of federal convictions.\n\n\"United States v. Morgan\" provides broad, general guidance to courts on the rules and procedures in coram nobis proceedings, but since the \"Morgan\" case in 1954, the Supreme Court and Congress seldom provide lower courts additional guidance. Thus, Appellate courts generally fill in the gaps and provide guidance for rules and procedures unclarified by Congress and the Supreme Court; however, the interpretations of rules and procedures of coram nobis may differ in each appellate court. Thus, for a former federal prisoner who is attempting to decide whether to file a petition for the writ of coram nobis, it is necessary to understand the source of the rules and procedures.\n\nThe United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States. Article One of the Constitution creates the legislature and provides Congress the means to create and enact laws. Article Three of the Constitution creates the judiciary and provides courts the means to interpret laws. Other than the writ of habeas corpus, the Constitution has no language permitting or restricting courts from issuing specific writs, including the writ of coram nobis.\n\nThe United States Congress enacts laws or statutes, and codifies these statutes in the United States Code. In contrast to the writ of habeas corpus, Congress has seldom enacted statutes regulating the writ of coram nobis. Statutes enacted by Congress regulating the writ of coram nobis are:\n\nFollowing the Constitution and Congressional statutes, the next highest source for direction and guidance of rules and procedures is the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the highest federal court. Lower courts, such as federal appellate courts and federal district courts, must follow the decisions of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has discretionary appellate jurisdiction, meaning the Court chooses to hear cases for reasons it deems “compelling reasons” (such as resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or resolving an important matter of law). Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, cannot override any law enacted by Congress unless the law violates the Constitution. Federal courts also cannot repeal a statute unless Congress clearly intended to repeal the statute.\nIn 1954, \"United States v. Morgan\" provides writ of coram nobis to former federal prisoners. The Court determined coram nobis relief “should be allowed . . . only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice”. Specifically, the circumstances must include all three of these conditions:\nSince 1954, the Supreme Court granted review of only one other coram nobis case. In 2009, the Court clarified that Article I military courts have jurisdiction to entertain coram nobis petitions to consider allegations that an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a fundamental respect. Other than providing military courts the authority to issue the writ, the Supreme Court has declined to provide federal courts additional guidance in coram nobis proceedings. Appellate courts have occasionally criticized the Supreme Court for failing to provide this additional guidance. The Seventh Circuit called the writ of coram nobis, “a phantom in the Supreme Court's cases” and contends “[t]wo ambiguous decisions on the subject in the history of the Supreme Court are inadequate.” The Sixth Circuit took a similar stance saying, “[t]he Supreme Court has decided only one coram nobis case in the last forty-two years, \"Morgan\", and that opinion is ambiguous concerning whether proof of an ongoing civil disability is required.” The First Circuit wrote that its decision of time limitations “derives from the Morgan Court's cryptic characterization of coram nobis as a ‘step in the criminal case.’” In another case, the First Circuit writes, “[t]he metes and bounds of the writ of coram nobis are poorly defined and the Supreme Court has not developed an easily readable roadmap for its issuance.”\n\nWhile the United States Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States federal court system, the United States courts of appeals, or circuit courts, are the intermediate appellate courts. There are thirteen U.S. courts of appeals. Eleven courts of appeals are numbered First through Eleventh and have geographical boundaries of various sizes. For example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of all federal courts in only three states: Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of nine western states and two U.S. territories. There is also a Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and a Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Other tribunals also have \"Court of Appeals\" in their titles, such as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which hears appeals in court-martial cases.\n\nCongressional statutes and Supreme Court decisions are controlling over courts of appeals. Absent statutory rules or Supreme Court case law, a court of appeals decision establishes a binding precedent for the courts in its circuit; however, a court of appeals decision is not binding for courts in other circuits. Generally, when a court of appeals hears an issue raised for the first time in that court, it arrives at the same conclusion as other courts of appeals on identical issues raised before those courts. However, whenever the courts of appeals arrive at different conclusions on the same issue, it creates a “circuit split”. The Supreme Court receives thousands of petitions each year, but only agrees to hear less than 100 of these cases. One of the most compelling reasons for the Supreme Court to accept a case is to resolve a circuit split. Currently, a circuit split exists in coram nobis cases involves the definition of “adverse consequences” The Supreme Court determined in \"United States v. Morgan\" that a petition for a writ of coram nobis must demonstrate that adverse consequences exist from the criminal conviction. Some courts of appeals determined adverse consequences occur with any collateral consequence of a conviction while other courts of appeals have limited “adverse consequences” to only a few collateral consequence of a conviction.\n\nDistrict courts must abide by congressional statutes, Supreme Court decisions, and decisions of the court of appeals in the federal judicial circuit in which the district court is located. Whenever a district court hears an issue that is not specifically addressed by statute or by case law of a higher court, district courts often “develop the record”. In case of an appeal, the higher courts have the district court's reasoned decision as guidance. A developed record not only greatly facilitates the process of appellate review but also ensures that the district court has carefully considered the issues and applied the applicable law.\n\nWrits of coram nobis are rare in U.S. federal courts due to the stringent criteria for issuance of the writ. \"Morgan\" established the following criteria required in a coram nobis petition in order for a federal court to issue the writ:\n\n\n\nOnly sixteen state courts and District of Columbia courts recognize the availability of writs of coram nobis or coram vobis. Each state is free to operate its own coram nobis procedures independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system. The writ of coram nobis is not available in a majority of states because those states have enacted uniform post-conviction acts that provide a streamlined, single remedy for obtaining relief from a judgment of conviction, and that remedy is available to petitioners who are no longer in custody. States that have replaced writs of coram nobis with remedies within their post-conviction proceedings are also independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system. These proceedings enacted by state legislatures may either be more or less stringent than the writs it replaced or the post-conviction proceedings of other states.\n\nThe following table provides whether each state's courts are authorized to issue a writ of coram nobis (or a writ of coram vobis), or provides the state statute which replaced or abolished the writ .\n\nAlabama state courts strictly follow the common law definition of the writ of \"coram nobis\" where the writ may only be issued to correct errors of fact.

All three had their convictions overturned through writs of coram nobis, and they were each awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nAfter the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration concluded that Japanese Americans living in the West Coast were a security threat and thus authorized the military to secure areas from which \"any or all persons may be excluded\". As a result, Japanese Americans were subject to curfew and other restrictions before being forced into internment camps. Hirabayashi, Yasui, and Korematsu, who were not acquainted with each other at the time, each defied the internment and were convicted for their resistance. Their convictions would be affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court between 1943 and 1944. Four decades after the Court's rulings, lawyers, including civil rights attorney, Peter Irons, re-opened their wartime convictions on the basis of newly discovered evidence of governmental misconduct. The new evidence indicated the government intentionally withheld \"The Ringle Report\", a report drafted by the Office of Naval Intelligence, which would have undermined the administration's position of the military actions, as it finally concluded that most Japanese Americans in the West Coast were not a national security threat at the time of Pearl Harbor.\n\nGordon Hirabayashi was born in April 1918 in Seattle, Washington. He was a senior student at the University of Washington at the time when Japanese Americans were ordered to report to internment camps. Although he first considered accepting internment, he ultimately defied it. In May 1942, Hirabayashi turned himself in to the FBI. After being convicted in October 1942 for the curfew violation, he was sentenced to 90 days in prison. He also served a one-year sentence at McNeil Island Penitentiary for Selective Service violations when he refused to answer questions which singled out Japanese Americans on the basis of race alone. He appealed to the Supreme Court where, in 1943, his conviction was upheld in \"Hirabayashi v. United States\". In 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a writ of coram nobis which effectively overturned his criminal conviction. Hirabayashi died in January 2012, and he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in May 2012.\n\nMinoru Yasui was born in 1916 in Hood River, Oregon. He attended law school at the University of Oregon and became the first Japanese American lawyer in Oregon in 1939. Upon the declaration of war, Yasui attempted to report for military duty, but his services were refused nine times. After hearing the news of internment, Yasui planned his legal challenge to the government's policies. In March 1942, he deliberately disobeyed the military implemented curfew in Portland, Oregon by walking around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11:00 pm in order to test the curfew's constitutionality. He was convicted in November 1942. Yasui appealed to the Supreme Court where, in 1943, his conviction was upheld in \"Yasui v. United States\". In January 1984, his conviction was overturned when the U.S. District Court in Oregon granted his writ of coram nobis. Yasui died in 1986, and he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November 2015.\n\nFred Korematsu was born in 1919 in Oakland, California. He attempted to enlist with the United States Navy when called for military duty under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, but he was rejected due to stomach ulcers. In March 1942, when Japanese Americans were ordered to report to assembly centers, he refused and went into hiding in the Oakland area. He was arrested in May 1942, and held at the Presidio of San Francisco military detention center until his conviction in September 1942. The U.S. Supreme Court in December 1944 upheld his conviction in \"Korematsu v. United States\". In November 1983, the U.S. District Court in San Francisco formally granted the writ of coram nobis and vacated his conviction. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998, and died in March 2005.\n\nIn December 2014, a writ of \"coram nobis\" was granted by a federal court to posthumously vacate the conviction of George Stinney, a 14-year-old black boy who was convicted of murder and executed in June 1944. Stinney was convicted in 1944 in a one-day trial of the first-degree murder of two white girls: 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker and 8-year-old Mary Emma Thames. After being arrested, Stinney was said to have confessed to the crime; however, there was no written record of his confession apart from notes provided by an investigating deputy, and no transcript of the brief trial. On June 16, 1944, Stinney was executed as a result of the conviction. On December 17, 2014, Stinney's conviction was posthumously vacated 70 years after his execution, because the federal court judge ruled that he had not been given a fair trial; he had no effective defense and therefore his Sixth Amendment rights had been violated.\n\nThe common law writ of error \"contra nobis\" and its equitable equivalent, the supplemental bill of review, do not appear to have survived the reforms to English law made in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.\n\nWrits of error as a separate proceeding were abolished by section 148 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (15 & 16 Vict., c.76), which instead provided that \"the Proceeding to Error Shall be a Step in the Cause\". Error was finally abolished 23 years later in 1875, when Schedule I, Order 58, rule 1 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 was brought into force and the Court of Appeal was created.\n\nThe modern practice at English law where a litigant seeks to rely upon evidence not known at trial is to bring an appeal.\n\nIn civil proceedings, CPR 52.11(1)(b) contains a presumption that civil appeals shall be limited to a review of a decision of the lower court, and CPR 52.11(2)(b) contains a presumption that the Court of Appeal shall not receive fresh evidence. The Court of Appeal will exercise its discretion to hear fresh evidence according to the over-riding objective in civil cases to deal with cases justly: however, three key criteria laid down by the Court of Appeal in \"Ladd v Marshall\" continue to be of relevance:\n\n\nMoreover, where it is \"necessary to do so in order to avoid real injustice\", in \"exceptional\" circumstances, and where \"there is no alternative effective remedy\", CPR 52.17(1) permits both the High Court and the Court of Appeal to re-open a final determination of an appeal.\n\nIn criminal proceedings, the Court of Appeal also has a discretion to admit fresh evidence on appeal. If it does so, the Court must ask itself whether, in light of the fresh evidence, the conviction is unsafe.\n\nSoon after the passage of the Judicature Acts, it was thought that, when a judgment had been obtained by wilful fraud of the victorious party, the aggrieved party's proper recourse was to bring a new action for fraud, because to try the alleged fraud required original jurisdiction, which the Court of Appeal did not have.\n\nIn so ruling, Jessell MR made specific references to the supplemental bill of review, the equitable equivalent of the writ of error \"contra nobis.\" However, the Court drew an analogy with the old law, rather than preserving it: in agreeing with Jessell MR, James LJ observed, \"if it is true that there was a fraud practised upon the Court, by which the Court was induced to make a wrong decree, the way to obtain relief will be to bring a \"fresh action\" to set aside the decree on the ground of fraud\" [emphasis added].\n\nSince the coming into force of the Civil Procedure Rules, the law has evolved further. In \"Noble v Owens\", the Court of Appeal held that the modern position is that it is now not necessary to commence a fresh action to cure a judgment fraudulently obtained. Instead, the powers of the Court of Appeal under CPR 52.10 are sufficiently broad to permit the Court of Appeal to refer the determination of the issue of fraud to a Judge of the High Court as part of the appeal proceedings, with a consequent saving of costs.\n\nIn criminal cases, the Court of Appeal has allowed appeals and quashed convictions on the basis of misconduct by Crown witnesses analogous to fraud, e.g., where prosecution witnesses had subsequently been convicted for giving perjured evidence during the original trial; or where police officers who took confessions from the appellants had subsequently been discredited in later proceedings.\n\nIn \"Cinpres Gas Injection Ltd v Melea Ltd\", an unsuccessful attempt was made to resurrect the supplemental bill of review. Jacob LJ, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that an attempt to invoke the old bill of review could not succeed because, for generations, applications for rehearing on the basis of fresh evidence had been made to the Court of Appeal and, if the bill of review procedure had survived the Judicature Acts, it had long since lapsed. The judge observed that \"it would make for better justice in principle for a prior decision to be impugnable on the grounds for which a bill of review once lay, namely that there was fresh evidence not discoverable by reasonable diligence, which 'entirely changes the aspect of the case (para. [100]). However, he also observed that the Court of Appeal had not been asked to consider its powers under CPR 52.17 to re-open a final appeal in \"exceptional circumstances\" and therefore could not say whether such an application would have succeeded.\n\nMoreover, in a Northern Ireland case, \"Walsh's Application\", in which an application was made for a writ of error \"coram nobis\" following an unsuccessful judicial review, Weatherup J followed the Court of Appeal in \"Cinpres\" by observing, \"While the Writ developed at Common Law, I doubt if the procedure survived the appeals process introduced by the Judicature (Ireland) Act 1875\", before referring to the provision of that Act dealing with the abolition of proceedings in error. The court concluded that it did not have the jurisdiction to alter the decision made on judicial review.\n\nThe above cases indicate that the Judicature Acts and the Civil Procedure Rules provide for a comprehensive system of appeals which effectively ousts the function served by the former bill of review and writ of error \"coram nobis\", which may now be extinct in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\n"}
{"id": "3421940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3421940", "title": "Cyber-security regulation", "text": "Cyber-security regulation\n\nA cybersecurity regulation comprises directives that safeguard information technology and computer systems with the purpose of forcing companies and organizations to protect their systems and information from cyberattacks like viruses, worms, Trojan horses, phishing, denial of service (DOS) attacks, unauthorized access (stealing intellectual property or confidential information) and control system attacks. There are numerous measures available to prevent cyberattacks.\n\nCybersecurity measures include firewalls, anti-virus software, intrusion detection and prevention systems, encryption, and login passwords. There have been attempts to improve cybersecurity through regulation and collaborative efforts between the government and the private sector to encourage voluntary improvements to cybersecurity. Industry regulators, including banking regulators, have taken notice of the risk from cybersecurity and have either begun or planned to begin to include cybersecurity as an aspect of regulatory examinations.\n\nIn 2011 the DoD released a guidance called the \"Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace\" which articulated five goals: to treat cyberspace as an operational domain, to employ new defensive concepts to protect DoD networks and systems, to partner with other agencies and the private sector in pursuit of a \"whole-of-government cybersecurity Strategy\", to work with international allies in support of collective cybersecurity and to support the development of a cyber workforce capable of rapid technological innovation. A March 2011 GAO report \"identified protecting the federal government's information systems and the nation's cyber critical infrastructure as a governmentwide high-risk area\" noting that federal information security had been designated a high-risk area since 1997. As of 2003 systems protecting critical infrastructure, called cyber critical infrastructure protection of cyber CIP have also been included.\n\nIn November 2013, the DoD put forward the new cybersecurity rule (78 Fed. Reg. 69373), which imposed certain requirements on contractors: compliance with certain NIST IT standards, mandatory reporting of cybersecurity incidents to the DoD, and a \"flow-down\" clause that applies the same requirements to subcontractors.\n\nA June 2013 Congressional report found there were over 50 statutes relevant to cybersecurity compliance. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) is one of the key statutes governing federal cybersecurity regulations.\n\nThere are few federal cybersecurity regulations, and the ones that exist focus on specific industries. The three main cybersecurity regulations are the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and the 2002 Homeland Security Act, which included the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). The three regulations mandate that healthcare organizations, financial institutions and federal agencies should protect their systems and information. For example, FISMA, which applies to every government agency, \"requires the development and implementation of mandatory policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security.\" However, the regulations do not address numerous computer related industries, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and software companies. Furthermore, the regulations do not specify what cybersecurity measures must be implemented and require only a \"reasonable\" level of security. The vague language of these regulations leaves much room for interpretation. Bruce Schneier, the founder of Cupertino's Counterpane Internet Security, argues that companies will not make sufficient investments in cybersecurity unless government forces them to do so. He also states that successful cyberattacks on government systems still occur despite government efforts.\n\nIt has been suggested that the Data Quality Act already provides the Office of Management and Budget the statutory authority to implement critical infrastructure protection regulations by the Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking process. The idea has not been fully vetted and would require additional legal analysis before a rulemaking could begin.\n\nState governments have attempted to improve cybersecurity by increasing public visibility of firms with weak security. In 2003, California passed the Notice of Security Breach Act, which requires that any company that maintains personal information of California citizens and has a security breach must disclose the details of the event. Personal information includes name, social security number, driver's license number, credit card number or financial information. Several other states have followed California's example and passed similar security breach notification regulations. Such security breach notification regulations punish firms for their cybersecurity failures while giving them the freedom to choose how to secure their systems. Also, the regulation creates an incentive for companies to voluntarily invest in cybersecurity to avoid the potential loss of reputation and the resulting economic loss that can come from a successful cyber attack. \n\nIn 2004, the California State Legislature passed California Assembly Bill 1950, which also applies to businesses that own or maintain personal information for California residents. The regulation dictates for businesses to maintain a reasonable level of security and that they required security practices also extend to business partners. The regulation is an improvement on the federal standard because it expands the number of firms required to maintain an acceptable standard of cybersecurity. However, like the federal legislation, it requires a \"reasonable\" level of cybersecurity, which leaves much room for interpretation until case law is established.\n\nThe US Congress has proposed numerous bills that expand upon cybersecurity regulation. The Consumer Data Security and Notification Act amends the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to require disclosure of security breaches by financial institutions. Congressmen have also proposed \"expanding Gramm-Leach-Bliley to all industries that touch consumer financial information, including any firm that accepts payment by a credit card.\" Congress has proposed cybersecurity regulations similar to California's Notice of Security Breach Act for companies that maintain personal information. The Information Protection and Security Act requires that data brokers \"ensure data accuracy and confidentiality, authenticate and track users, detect and prevent unauthorized activity, and mitigate potential harm to individuals.\"\n\nIn addition to requiring companies to improve cybersecurity, Congress is also considering bills that criminalize cyberattacks. The Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass Act (SPY ACT) was a bill of this type. It focused on phishing and spyware bill and was passed on May 23, 2005 in the US House of Representatives but died in the US Senate. The bill \"makes unlawful the unauthorized usage of a computer to take control of it, modify its setting, collect or induce the owner to disclose personally identifiable information, install unsolicited software, and tamper with security, anti-spyware, or anti-virus software.\"\n\nOn May 12, 2011, US Barack Obama proposed a package of cybersecurity legislative reforms to improve the security of US persons, the federal government, and critical infrastructure. A year of public debate and Congress hearings followed, resulting in the House of Representative passing an information sharing bill and the Senate developing a compromise bill seeking to balance national security, privacy, and business interests.\n\nIn July 2012, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 was proposed by Senators Joseph Lieberman and Susan Collins. The bill would have required creating voluntary \"best practice standards\" for protection of key infrastructure from cyber attacks, which businesses would be encouraged to adopt through incentives such as liability protection. The bill was put to a vote in the Senate but failed to pass. Obama had voiced his support for the Act in a \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed, and it also received support from officials in the military and national security including John O. Brennan, the chief counterterrorism adviser to the White House. According to \"The Washington Post\", experts said that the failure to pass the act may leave the United States \"vulnerable to widespread hacking or a serious cyberattack.\" The act was opposed by Republican senators like John McCain who was concerned that the act would introduce regulations that would not be effective and could be a \"burden\" for businesses. After the Senate vote, Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison stated that the opposition to the bill was not a partisan issue but it not take the right approach to cybersecurity.The senate vote was not strictly along partisan lines, as six Democrats voted against it, and five Republicans voted for it. Critics of the bill included the US Chamber of Commerce, advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, cybersecurity expert Jody Westby, and The Heritage Foundation, both of whom argued that although the government must act on cybersecurity, the bill was flawed in its approach and represented \"too intrusive a federal role.\"\n\nIn February 2013, Obama proposed the Executive Order Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. It represents the latest iteration of policy but is not considered to be law as it has not been addressed by Congress yet. It seeks to improve existing public-private partnerships by enhancing timeliness of information flow between DHS and critical infrastructure companies. It directs federal agencies to share cyber threat intelligence warnings to any private sector entity identified as a target. It also tasks DHS with improving the process to expedite security clearance processes for applicable public and private sector entities to enable the federal government to share this information at the appropriate sensitive and classified levels. It directs the development of a framework to reduce cyber risks, incorporating current industry best practices and voluntary standards. Lastly, it tasks the federal agencies involved with incorporating privacy and civil liberties protections in line with Fair Information Practice Principles.\n\nIn January 2015, Obama announced a new cybersecurity legislative proposal. The proposal was made in an effort to prepare the US from the expanding number of cyber crimes. In the proposal, Obama outlined three main efforts to work towards a more secure cyberspace for the US. The first main effort emphasized the importance of enabling cybersecurity information sharing. By enabling that, the proposal encouraged information sharing between the government and the private sector. That would allow the government to know what main cyber threats private firms are facing and would then allow the government to provide liability protection to those firms that shared their information. Furthermore, that would give the government a better idea of what the US needs to be protected against. Another main effort that was emphasized in this proposal was to modernize the law enforcement authorities to make them more equipped to properly deal with cyber crimes by giving them the tools they need in order to do so. It would also update classifications of cyber crimes and consequences. One way this would be done would be by making it a crime for overseas selling of financial information. Another goal of the effort is to place cyber crimes prosecutable. The last major effort of the legislative proposal was to require businesses to report data breaching to consumers if their personal information had been sacrificed. By requiring companies to do so, consumers are aware of when they are in danger of identity theft.\n\nIn February 2016, Obama developed a Cybersecurity National Security Action Plan (CNAP). The plan was made to create long-term actions and strategies in an effort to protect the US against cyber threats. The focus of the plan was to inform the public about the growing threat of cyber crimes, improve cybersecurity protections, protects personal information of Americans, and to inform Americans on how to control digital security. One of the highlights of this plan include creating a \"Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity.\" The goal of this is to create a Commission that consists of a diverse group of thinkers with perspectives that can contribute to make recommendations on how to create a stronger cybersecurity for the public and private sector. The second highlight of the plan is to change Government IT. The new Government IT will make it so that a more secure IT can be put in place. The third highlight of the plan is to give Americans knowledge on how they can secure their online accounts and avoid theft of their personal information through multi-factor authentication. The fourth highlight of the plan is to invest 35% more money that was invested in 2016 into cybersecurity.\n\nIn addition to regulation, the federal government has tried to improve cybersecurity by allocating more resources to research and collaborating with the private sector to write standards. In 2003, the President's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace made the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for security recommendations and researching national solutions. The plan calls for cooperative efforts between government and industry \"to create an emergency response system to cyber-attacks and to reduce the nation's vulnerability to such threats\n\" In 2004, the US Congress allocated $4.7 billion toward cybersecurity and achieving many of the goals stated in the President's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. Some industry security experts state that the President's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace is a good first step but is insufficient. Bruce Schneier stated, \"The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace hasn't secured anything yet.\" However, the President's National Strategy clearly states that the purpose is to provide a framework for the owners of computer systems to improve their security rather than the government taking over and solving the problem. However, companies that participate in the collaborative efforts outlined in the strategy are not required to adopt the discovered security solutions.\n\nIn the United States, the US Congress is trying to make information more transparent after the Cyber Security Act of 2012, which would have created voluntary standards for protecting vital infrastructure, failed to pass through the Senate. In February 2013, the White House issued an executive order, titled \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity,\" which allows the executive branch to share information about threats with more companies and individuals. In April 2013, the House of Representatives passed the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA), which calls for protecting against lawsuits aimed at companies that disclose breach information. The Obama administration said that it might veto the bill.\n\nIn the light of the hacking of the website of the Indian Space Agency's commercial arm in 2015, Antrix Corporation and government's Digital India programme, a cyberlaw expert and advocate at the Supreme Court of India, Pavan Duggal, stated that \"a dedicated cyber security legislation as a key requirement for India. It is not sufficient to merely put cyber security as a part of the IT Act. We have to see cyber security not only from the sectoral perspective, but also from the national perspective.\"\n\nCybersecurity standards have been of great prominence in today's technology driven businesses. To maximize their profits, corporations leverage technology by running most of their operations by the internet. Since there are a large number of risks that entail internetwork operations, such operations must be protected by comprehensive and extensive regulations. Existing cybersecurity regulations all cover different aspects of business operations and often vary by region or country in which a business operates. Because of the differences in a country's society, infrastructure, and values, one overarching cyber security standard is not optimal for decreasing risks. While US standards provide a basis for operations, the European Union has created a more tailored regulation for businesses operating specifically within the EU. Also, in light of Brexit, it is important to consider how the UK has chosen to adhere to such security regulations.\n\nThree major regulations within the EU include the ENISA, the NIS Directive and the EU GDPR.\n\nThe European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) is a governing agency that was originally set up by the Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 for the Purpose of Raising Network and Information Security (NIS) for all internetwork operations in the EU. ENISA currently runs under Regulation (EU) No 526/2013, which has replaced the original regulation in 2013. ENISA works actively with all member states of the EU to provide a range of services. The focus of their operations are on three factors:\nENISA is made up of a management board that relies on the support of the executive director and the Permanent Stakeholders Group. Most operations, however, are run by the heads of various departments.\n\nENISA has released various publications that cover all major issues on cybersecurity. ENISA's past and current initiatives include the EU Cloud Strategy, Open Standards in Information Communications Technology, a Cyber Security Strategy of the EU and a Cyber Security Coordination Group. ENISA also works in collaboration with existing international standard organizations like the ISO and the ITU.\n\nOn July 6, 2016, the European Parliament set into policy the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (the NIS Directive). \n\nThe directive went into effect in August 2016, and all member states of the European Union were given 21 months to incorporate the directive's regulations into their own national laws. The aim of the NIS Directive is to create an overall higher level of cybersecurity in the EU. The directive significantly affects digital service providers (DSPs) and operators of essential services (OESs). Operators of essential services include any organizations whose operations would be greatly affected in the case of a security breach if they engage in critical societal or economic activities. Both DSPs and OES are now held accountable for reporting major security incidents to Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRT). While DSPs are not held to as stringent regulations as operators of essential services, DSPs that are not set up in the EU but still operate in the EU still face regulations. Even if DSPs and OES outsource the maintenance of their information systems to third parties, the NIS Directive still holds them accountable for any security incidents.\n\nThe member states of the EU are required to create a NIS directive strategy, which includes the CSIRTs, in addition to National Competent Authorities (NCAs) and Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Such resources are given the responsibility of handling cybersecurity breaches in a way that minimizes impact. In addition, all member states of the EU are encouraged to share cyber security information.\n\nSecurity requirements include technical measures that manage the risks of cybersecurity breaches in a preventative manner. Both DSP and OES must provide information that allows for an in depth assessment of their information systems and security policies. All significant incidents must be notified to the CSIRTs. Significant cybersecurity incidents are determined by the number of users affected by the security breach as well as the longevity of the incident and the geographical reach of the incident.\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was set into place on 14 April 2016, but the current date of enforcement is set to be on 25 May 2018. The GDPR aims to bring a single standard for data protection among all member states in the EU. Changes include the redefining of geographical borders. It applies to entities that operate in the EU or deal with the data of any resident of the EU. Regardless of where the data is processed, if an EU citizen's data is being processed, the entity is now subject to the GDPR.\n\nFines are also much more stringent under the GDPR and can total €20 million euros or 4% of an entity's annual turnover, whichever is higher. In addition, like in previous regulations, all data breaches that effect the rights and freedoms of individuals residing in the EU must be disclosed within 72 hours.\n\nThe overarching board, the EU Data Protection Board, EDP, is in charge of all oversight set by the GDPR.\n\nConsent plays a major role in the GDPR. Companies that hold data in regards to EU citizens must now also offer to them the right to back out of sharing data just as easily as when they consented to sharing data.\n\nIn addition, citizens can also restrict processing of the data stored on them and can choose to allow companies to store their data but not process it, which creates a clear differentiation. Unlike previous regulations, the GDPR also restricts the transfer of a citizen's data outside of the EU or to a third party without a citizen's prior consent.\n\nThe proposed ePrivacy Regulation is also planned to be applicable from 25 May 2018.\n\nWhile experts agree that cybersecurity improvements are necessary, there is disagreement about whether the solution is more government regulation or more private-sector innovation.\n\nMany government officials and cybersecurity experts believe that the private sector has failed to solve the cybersecurity problem and that regulation is needed. Richard Clarke states that \"industry only responds when you threaten regulation. If industry does not respond [to the threat], you have to follow through.\" He believes that software companies must be forced to produce more secure programs. Bruce Schneier also supports regulation that encourages software companies to write more secure code through economic incentives. US Representative Rick Boucher (D–VA) proposes improving cybersecurity by making software companies liable for security flaws in their code. In addition, to improving software security, Clarke believes that certain industries, such as utilities and ISPs, require regulation.\n\nOn the other hand, many private-sector executives and lobbyists believe that more regulation will restrict their ability to improve cybersecurity. Harris Miller, a lobbyist and president of the Information Technology Association of America, believes that regulation inhibits innovation. Rick White, former corporate attorney and president and CEO of the lobby group TechNet, also opposes more regulation. He states that \"the private-sector must continue to be able to innovate and adapt in response to new attack methods in cyber space, and toward that end, we commend President Bush and the Congress for exercising regulatory restraint.\"\n\nAnother reason many private-sector executives oppose regulation is that it is costly and involves government oversight in private enterprise. Firms are just as concerned about regulation reducing profits as they are about regulation limiting their flexibility to solve the cybersecurity problem efficiently.\n\n\n"}

After graduating from Yale University in 1858, Brinton studied at Jefferson Medical College for two years and spent the next year travelling in Europe. He continued his studies at Paris and Heidelberg. From 1862 to 1865, during the American Civil War, he was a surgeon in the Union army, acting during 1864-1865 as surgeon-in-charge of the U.S. Army general hospital at Quincy, Illinois. Brinton was sun-stroked at Missionary Ridge (Third Battle of Chattanooga) and was never again able to travel in very hot weathers. This handicap affected his career as an ethnologist.\n\nAfter the war, Brinton practiced medicine in West Chester, Pennsylvania for several years; was the editor of a weekly periodical, the Medical and Surgical Reporter, in Philadelphia from 1874 to 1887; became professor of ethnology and archaeology in the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia in 1884; and was professor of American linguistics and archaeology in the University of Pennsylvania from 1886 until his death.\n\nHe was a member of numerous learned societies in the United States and in Europe and was president at different times of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia, of the American Folklore Society, the American Philosophical Society, and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nAt his presidential address to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in August 1895, Brinton advocated theories of scientific racism that were pervasive at that time. As Charles A. Lofgren notes in his book, \"The Plessy Case,\" although Brinton \"accepted the 'psychical unity' throughout the human species,\" he claimed \"all races were 'not equally endowed,' which disqualified [some of] them from the atmosphere of modern enlightenment.\" He asserted some have \"...an inborn tendency, constitutionally recreant to the codes of civilization, and therefore technically criminal.\" Further, he said the characteristics of \"races, nations, tribes...supply the only sure foundations for legislation, not \"a priori\" notions of the rights of man.\"\n\nBrinton was an anarchist during his last several years of life. In April 1896, he addressed the Ethical Fellowship of Philadelphia with a lecture on \"What the Anarchists Want,\" to a friendly audience. In October 1897, Brinton had dinner with Peter Kropotkin after the famous anarchist's only speaking engagement at Philadelphia. Kropotkin had refused invitations from all of the city's elites.\n\nOn the occasion of his memorial meeting on October 6, 1900, the keynote speaker Albert H. Smyth stated: \"In Europe and America, he sought the society of anarchists and mingled sometimes with the malcontents of the world that he might appreciate their grievances, and weigh their propositions for reform and change.\" \n\nFrom 1868 to 1899, Brinton wrote many books, and a large number of pamphlets, brochures, addresses and magazine articles.\nHis works include:\nIn addition, he edited and published a Library of American Aboriginal Literature (8 vols. 1882-1890), a valuable contribution to the science of anthropology in America. Of the eight volumes; six were edited by Brinton himself, one by Horatio Hale and one by Albert Samuel Gatschet. His 1885 work is notable for its role in the Walam Olum controversy.\n\n"}
{"id": "33042705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33042705", "title": "Earasaid", "text": "Earasaid\n\n\"See also Highland dress, belted plaid.\"\n\nAn earasaid, or arasaid is a draped garment worn in Scotland as part of traditional female highland dress. It may be a belted plaid (literally, a belted blanket), or an unbelted wrap. Traditionally, earasaids might be plain, striped or tartan; it might be brightly coloured or made of \"lachdan\" (dun or undyed) wool. Some colours were more expensive than others. Modern highland dress makes earasaids from the same heraldic tartan cloth used for kilts.\n\nIn cut, it is a rectangle, longer than the wearer is tall, and wider than the wearer's waist circumference. The bottom edge is ankle length and the top edge, when not being used as a hood, may hang cape-like behind. The width may be pleated until it will wrap around the waist, and the pleats held under a belt. In this case, the cloth below the belt hangs like a skirt; the cloth above the belt may be pinned or pulled over the head. The plaid may also be worn unbelted; and it seems it was also later worn at waist-width (see images below).\n\nNear the end of the seventeenth century, Martin Martin gave a description of traditional women's clothing in the Western Islands, including the \"earasaid\" and its brooches and buckles.\"The ancient dress wore by the women, and which is yet wore by some of the vulgar, called \"arisad\", is a white plaid, having a few small stripes of black, blue and red; it reached from the neck to the heels, and was tied before on the breast with a buckle of silver or brass, according to the quality of the person. I have seen some of the former of an hundred marks value; it was broad as any ordinary pewter plate, the whole curiously engraven with various animals etc. There was a lesser buckle which was wore in the middle of the larger, and above two ounces weight; it had in the centre a large piece of crystal, or some finer stone, and this was set all around with several finer stones of a lesser size. The plaid being pleated all round, was tied with a belt below the breast; the belt was of leather, and several pieces of silver intermixed with the leather like a chain. The lower end of the belt has a piece of plate about eight inches long, and three in breadth, curiously engraven; the end of which was adorned with fine stones, or pieces of red coral. They wore sleeves of scarlet cloth, closed at the end as men's vests, with gold lace round them, having plate buttons with fine stones. The head dress was a fine kerchief of linen strait (tight) about the head, hanging down the back taper-wise; a large lock of hair hangs down their cheeks above their breast, the lower end tied with a knot of ribbands.\"\n\nThe 1845 illustration is a reconstruction based on this description, then a century and a half old. Somewhat older drawings from life do not show details of the garment:\n\nOne early (early 19th century) dictionary definition of \"earasaid\" describes it, in the past tense, as full-length and worn without underclothing. Martin Martin describes it a full-length and worn over a sleeved top. Later descriptions (notably Burt) use the word \"plaid\" to describe, at first, wraps that cover the whole body, and then garments that cover only from head to waist. Poorer people are described as wearing full-length blankets.\nThe Ladies drefs as in \"England\", with this Difference, that when they go abroad, from the higheft to the loweft, they wear a Plaid, which cover Half of the Face, and all their Body. In \"Spain\", \"Flanders\", and \"Holland\", you know the Women go all to Church and Market, with a black Mantle over their Heads and Body: But thefe in \"Scotland\" are all ftrip'd with Green, Scarlet, and other Colours, and moft of them lin'd with Silk ; which in the Middle of a Church, on a \"Sunday\", looks like a \"Parterre de Fleurs\".\n\nThe Minister here in Scotland would have the Ladies come to Kirk in their Plaids, which hide any loose Dress, and their Faces, too, if they would be persuaded, in order to prevent the wandering Thoughts of young Fellows, and perhaps some young old ones too; for the Minister looks upon a well-dressed Woman to be an Object unfit to be seen in the Time of Divine Service, especially if she be handsome.\n\nThe before-mentioned Writer of a \"Journey through Scotland, \" has borrowed a Thought from the Tatler or Spectator, I do not remember which of them.\n\nSpeaking of the Ladies' Plaids, he says — \"They are striped with Green, Scarlet, and other Colours, which, in the Middle of a Church on a Sunday, look like a Parterre de Fleurs.'\" Instead of striped he should have said chequered, but that would not so well agree with his Flowers ; and I must ask Leave to differ from him in the Simile, for at first I thought it a very odd sight ; and as to outward Appearance, more fit to be compared with an Assembly of Harlequins than a Bed of Tulips. \n\nThe Plaid is the Undress of the Ladies; and to a genteel Woman, who adjusts it with a good Air, it is a becoming Veil.

{"id": "1796622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1796622", "title": "George Rudé", "text": "George Rudé\n\nGeorge Rudé (8 February 1910 – 8 January 1993) was a British Marxist historian, specializing in the French Revolution and \"history from below\", especially the importance of crowds in history.\n\nBorn in Oslo, Norway, the son of Jens Essendrop Rude, a Norwegian engineer, and Amy Geraldine Elliot, an English woman educated in Germany, Rudé spent his early years in Norway. After World War I, his family moved to England, where he was educated at Shrewsbury School and Trinity College, Cambridge. A specialist in modern languages, he taught at Stowe and St. Paul's schools. After completing university, Rudé took a trip to the Soviet Union with friends. When he returned he was a \"committed Communist and anti-Fascist\", despite his family’s fairly conservative political views.\nIn 1935 Rudé joined the British Communist Party. Communism awoke in Rudé an interest in history in which he pursued during the 1930s and 1940s attending London University part-time. During this time he taught at the preparatory schools of Stowe and St Paul’s. When the war broke out he joined the London Fire Service where he extinguished fires caused by German bombs.\n\nHe received his doctorate at the University of London in 1950 for a thesis on crowd action during the French Revolution. He taught modern languages in English secondary schools while publishing. His first book, \"The Crowd in the French Revolution\", soon became a classic.\n\nRudé was actively involved with the Communist party, an affiliation which caused him many hardships during his life. In 1949, he was relieved of his duties at St Paul’s for the activities of the political party which he was affiliated with. He accepted teaching positions at Sir Walter St John's Grammar School for Boys and later at Holloway Comprehensive School. Rudé, making his new academic focus history, and with very little to back his research in Paris of revolutionary France, became a leading British historian of the French Revolution. Rudé contributed to the \"history from below\" view of history, which is history from the view of the oppressed. He focused especially on those who participated in the riots and rebellions. He is credited by Eric Hobsbawm as having been the only member of the Historians' Group of the English Communist Party to write 18th-century history, exploring the chronological \"no-man's land between the Group's two most flourishing sections\". After writing an article about rioters during the French Revolution, he was awarded the esteemed Alexander Prize by the Royal Historical Society in 1956. Rudé wrote and was featured in a number of journals and created a scholarly name for himself under the wing of his mentor, Georges Lefebvre.\n\nHobsbawm alleged that Rudé's thesis advisor, (Alfred Cobban, a political conservative), blocked any chances Rudé may have had at getting an appointment at a University, but Friguglietti says there is no evidence of that. Feeling shunned in Britain, Rudé began looking to opportunities abroad.\n\nIn 1959, he was appointed senior lecturer at the University of Adelaide in Australia, in his wife Doreen's home town. He took the opportunity of his time in Australia, to research 19th-century British and Irish political prisoners transported to Australia as convicts. This later resulted in a major work, \"Protest and Punishment: The Story of Social and Political Protesters Transported to Australia, 1788–1868\".\n\nRudé, like most prominent communists in Australia, was put under surveillance by the government's domestic security agency, ASIO. However, they found little of interest to record. One agent noted: \"history books of which he is the author and reports of his class work at schools in England all show that he is objective in his approach to his teaching subject and has not let his own personal politics intrude in any way\".\n\nRudé accepted an offer of a foundation chair of history, at the new University of Stirling, in Scotland, during 1967. However, he fell out with the university administration and returned to Adelaide in 1969, as professor of history at Flinders University. In 1970, Rudé moved to Montreal, Canada, where he taught at George Williams University (later Concordia University) until he retired in 1987. He founded the Inter-University Center for European Studies. Rudé was also a visiting professor at the University of Tokyo, Columbia University in New York and the college of William and Mary in Virginia. \nWhile he was at Concordia, he also taught in the Graduate Programme of Social and Political Thought at York University, Toronto.\n\nRudé suffered deteriorating health after the early 1970s and had a brain tumour removed in 1983. After retiring, he returned to England, eventually dying in hospital at Battle on 8 January 1993. His widow Doreen placed his ashes in the garden behind their home in Rye. A tall, handsome and athletic man, he always retained the manners of an English gentleman as well as his left-wing sympathies.\n\nGeorge Rudé’s historical work focused primarily on the French Revolution and crowd behaviour in France and Great Britain, during the 18th and 19th centuries. Rudé utilizes the method of reporting and analyzing history from the \"bottom up,\" focusing on the people, not the leaders and elites. Rudé’s most notable works include \"The Crowd in the French Revolution\", \"The Crowd in History\", \"Revolutionary Europe: 1783–1815\", \"Ideology and Popular Protest\", \"Paris and London in the Eighteenth Century\", \"Debate on Europe: 1815–1850\" and \"Captain Swing: A Social History of the great English Agricultural Uprising of 1830\" (co-authored with Eric Hobsbawm).\n\nOne of Rudé’s most influential works is \"The Crowd in History\", focusing on 18th- and 19th-century dissidents and revolutionaries in France and Great Britain. Rudé analyzes the impact and importance of various uprisings between 1730 and 1848. He identifies grain shortages in France and industrialisation in Britain as the two recurring catalysts for disturbance. In this work Rudé employs a clear and precise prose style, beginning with specific examples of disturbances in Part 1, and moving on in Part 2 to \"a critical analysis of the crowd in its various manifestations\". In his introduction Rudé expresses a hope that other historians will be inspired by his new bottom-up approach to write crowd-centric histories of other eras. He made no secret of his sympathy for the underdog, and this history offers a robust defence of popular uprisings in this period.\n\nIn \"The Crowd in the French Revolution\", Rudé examines the historically neglected crowd of the French Revolution. He explains that the Revolution was not only political but more importantly a social upheaval in which the common Frenchmen played a tremendous role in the course and outcome of the Revolution. Most significantly, Rudé analyzes the French crowds in great depth to understand their composition and force on history.\n\nRudé wrote a broad survey \"Revolutionary Europe: 1783-1815\" in traditional fashion. In is he portrays France and Europe before, during and after the French Revolution. He examines the significance of the Revolution in context to the rest of the European world. The broader focus of this work was a shift from his crowd studies, which would resume in his later works.\n\nRudé’s \"Paris and London in the 18th Century\" explains the popular protests and revolts of Paris and London during the 18th century. Rudé compares and contrasts the time, place, social, political and economic factors of Paris and London. He examines the pre-industrial stages and the turbulent events that occurred in both European capitals. While this work is not predominately a history from the \"bottom up,\" Rudé does incorporate the impact of each class in Paris and London during the 18th-century events.\n\nIn \"Ideology and Popular Protest\", Rudé defines the theory behind the ideology of protest beginning with its origins in Marx and Engels. He explains his theory of ideology through various situations in pre-industrial Europe. Rudé also utilizes his explained ideology in the event of the English protests of the 18th and early 19th century and the development of the English industrial society, and closing with the possibly implications of industry on society.\n\nRudé, in \"Debate on Europe: 1815-1850\", attempts to utilize the views and interpretations of other historians to argue the significant period of the first half of the 19th century. He examines the rise of national powers, the impacts of the Industrial Revolution, differences of political opinions and the various revolutions throughout Europe during this period. In addition, Rudé inserts his own argument based on the impressive and extraordinary change in Europe during this era as well as inferring at what point this change began.\n\n\"Captain Swing: A Social History of the great English Agricultural Uprising of 1830\" is a prime example of George Rudé’s focus on history \"from below\" and the examination of common people. In \"Captain Swing\", Rudé examines the people of the 1830 agricultural uprising and the impacts of these events. The entire focus of this work is on the crowd and their history, revealing a historical interpretation of history from the \"bottom up.\"\n\nGeorge Rudé’s influence was his emphasis and development of \"history from below\". Following the new Annales School of thought, Rudé strove to cast off the idea that history was only about nation-states and the men who ruled them. Accompanying Rudé in this shift was the ‘new left’, which according to Mark Gilderhus these liberal historians, \"showed the feasibility of doing history while incorporating attitudes and viewpoints other than those associated with white male elites\". Though Rudé was not part of this movement directly, he was firmly inside their ideas and helped to promote them. He believed, along with the ‘new left’ that it was the neglected people who could be used to reshape the face of history. The historian James Friguglietti comments that Rudé’s work, \"displayed sympathy for the lower classes, whether laborers or convicted criminals\". By focusing on lower classes Rudé hoped to create a new understanding of histories major events.\n\nRudé’s communist ties shaped his way of perceiving history and opened him up to the idea of looking at the history of protesters. Revolutions were transforming events, and Rudé sought to bring light to why someone would join in such an endeavor. Marxist theory believes that everyone’s primary motives for acting are always linked with their material need. Using this frame of reference Rudé places it on the people of the French Revolution and created specific faces in the crowds. He sought to dismantle the myth that the crowd in the revolution is seen as a great evil mass of people bent on destruction of order. As Rudé paints it, \"those who took to the streets were ordinary, sober citizens, not half-crazed animals, not criminals\". By taking such a view the history of the French revolution was transformed. Common people were suddenly being taken as important historical actors in their own context.\n\nIn the decades that Rudé was writing, his new way of looking at history fit well into the social scene. It was the age of liberation, as the oppressive systems that segregated classes, genders, and races were being torn down. People were in need of a new history that included all aspects of society. Writing \"history from below\", brought in those forgotten yet not unimportant members of history into the narrative. Rudé did this by showing the common people in the revolutions and protests as key players who actively sought to change history. By focusing on such groups, historians have, \"inspired new debates over the roles of class, gender, and race in accounting for human divisions and inequalities.\" In helping bring a voice to prisoners and protesters, George Rudé contributed significantly to the study of history.\n\nRudé is not without his detractors. From the start, his Marxist view of history made teaching in Great Britain very difficult at the height of Cold War fervour and brought him severe criticism. The main criticism that continues on after his death was that after developing his initial thesis of the crowd in history, he continued using that model in every case to prove his point. Some of Rudé’s work became less highly regarded after the collapse of the USSR, but, overall, his contributions to social history and the understanding of protests greatly enhanced how historians look at the past and its actors.\n\n\n"}

It is a scholarly journal published by Oxford University Press. Originally sub-titled \"A Journal of Socialist Historians\", it later changed the sub-title to \"A Journal of Socialist and Feminist Historians\" before dropping the sub-title in 1994.\n\nThe Journal \"publishes a wide variety of essays, reports and reviews, ranging from literary to economic subjects, local history to geopolitical analyses.\" According to the \"Times Higher Education\" website, \"History Workshop Journal\" is ranked number 9 in the top 20 history journals worldwide, ranked by their five-year impact factors, . This information was presented in Thomson Reuters’ \"Journal Citation Reports\" for the social sciences for 2009.\n\nThe main aim of the History Workshop movement was to promote the historiographical tradition known variously as history from below, social history, the history of everyday life, or simply people's history. Bill Schwarz wrote that the \"History Workshop functioned in Britain as an effective alternative historical apparatus. It countered the intellectual and political conservatism of the dominant historical profession, setting up an alternative means for producing historical knowledge which had roots deep in the subordinate groups of British society\". Samuel defined the movement as being \"the belief that history is or ought to be a collaborative enterprise, one in which the researcher, the archivist, the curator and the teacher, the 'do-it-yourself' enthusiast and the local historian, the family history societies and the individual archaeologist, should all be regarded as equally engaged.\"\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the History Workshop movement grew in popularity, which saw the foundation of a number of local History Workshops and a series of pamphlets, books and journals, including the \"History Workshop Journal\". The British movement also inspired several international History Workshops in Europe, South Africa and America.\n\nAn associated website, the History Workshop Online, was launched by the editorial collective of the \"History Workshop Journal\" in 2011. This moderated website publishes shorter and more contemporary-focused articles than appear in \"History Workshop Journal\", as well as editorials, debates, news and events, and a series of articles on \"Radical Objects\". These \"Radical Objects\" are tangible objects, such as badges or pamphlets, with direct relationships to events or themes in radical history. In October 2012, the History Workshop Online, in collaboration with the Bishopsgate Institute, launched an online archive of material from the History Workshop Movement, which includes background information about each History Workshop and associated events from the 1960s to the 1990s. The material available on the History Workshop archive also includes scans of images, tickets and pamphlets and audio recordings from the History Workshops themselves.\n\n\n\n"}

It was created by legislation enacted by the Parliament of Poland. The Institute specialises in the legal and historical examination of the 20th century history of Poland in particular. IPN investigates both Nazi and Communist crimes committed in Poland between 1939 and the Revolutions of 1989, documents its findings and disseminates the results of its investigations to the public.\n\nThe Institute was established in law by the Polish Parliament on 18 December 1998, and incorporated the earlier 1991-passed Main Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation (which itself had replaced a 1945-passed body on Nazi crimes). It began its activities on 1 July 2000. During the first fifteen years following its inception the IPN collected over of archives, released 1,794 publications, organized 453 exhibits, held 817 conferences, and launched 30 educational internet portals. In the same period, the Institute researchers held interviews with over 103,000 witnesses and interrogated 508 individuals charged with criminal offences, leading to 137 sentences by the courts of justice.\n\nAccording to a new law which went into effect on 15 March 2007, IPN was to be mandated to carry out lustration procedures prescribed by Polish law. However, key articles of that law were judged unconstitutional by Poland's constitutional court on 11 May 2007, so the role of IPN in the lustration process is at present unclear. The IPN is a founding member of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience organisation.\n\nIPN's main areas of activity, in line with its original mission statement, include researching and documenting the losses which were suffered by the Polish Nation as a result of World War II and during the post-war totalitarian period. The Institute informs about the patriotic traditions of resistance against the occupational forces, and the Polish citizens' fight for sovereignty of the nation, including their efforts in defence of freedom and human dignity in general. IPN investigates crimes committed on Polish soil against Polish citizens as well as people of other citizenships wronged in the country. War crimes which are not affected by statute of limitations according to Polish law include:\nIt is the IPN's duty to prosecute crimes against peace and humanity, as much as war crimes. Its mission includes the need to compensate for damages which were suffered by the repressed and harmed people at a time when human rights were disobeyed by the state,\nand educate the public about recent history of Poland. IPN collects, organises and archives all documents about the Polish communist security apparatus active from 22 July 1944 to 31 December 1989.\n\nIPN was created by special legislation on 18 December 1998. IPN is governed by the chairman. This chairman is chosen by a supermajority (60%) of the Polish Parliament (Sejm) with the approval of the Senate of Poland on a request by a Collegium of IPN. The chairman has a 5-year term of office. The first chairman of the IPN was Leon Kieres, elected by the Sejm for five years on 8 June 2000 (term 30 June 2000 – 29 December 2005). The second chairman was Janusz Kurtyka, elected on 9 December 2005 with a term that started 29 December 2005 until his death in the Smolensk airplane crash on 10 April 2010. Franciszek Gryciuk was acting chairman from 2010 to 2011, when the current chairman, Łukasz Kamiński, was elected by the Sejm.\n\nThe IPN is divided into:\n\nOn 29 April 2010, acting president Bronislaw Komorowski signed into law a parliamentary act that reformed the Institute of National Remembrance.\n\nThe research conducted by IPN from December 2000 falls into four main topical areas:\n\nAmong the most widely reported cases investigated by the IPN thus far is the Jedwabne Pogrom, a pogrom of Polish Jews \"committed directly by Poles, but inspired by the Germans\" in 1941. A selection of other cases include:\n\nIPN is involved in dissemination of its research results in the form of publications, particularly the IPN Bulletin (Biuletyn IPN, \"Pamięć.pl\") and the \"Remembrance and Justice\" periodicals, exhibitions, seminars, panel discussions, film reviews, workshops and school curricula. Since December 2000 IPN has organized over 30 academic conferences (particularly the Warsaw Congress of Science organized every year in September); 22 exhibitions in various museums and educational competitions involving thousands of students. \"IPN Bulletin\" is of an informative and popular-scientific character and contains articles pertaining to the history of Poland in the years 1939–1990 as well as describes the current IPN activities. \"Remembrance and Justice\" appears every half a year and is a scientific historical magazine. IPN also publishes books which are usually edited as collections of documents, reports and memories, but also scientific elaborations (78 of such publications have appeared till April 2007).\n\nThe Public Education Office co-operates on a permanent basis with the Ministry of National Education and Sport, having signed a Co-operation Agreement in 2001. IPN gives opinions of curricula and textbooks on history that are used in Polish schools and is involved in teacher training activities. The IPN also co-organizes postgraduate diploma studies on history at the Jagiellonian University and the University of Maria Curie-Skłodowska.\n\nThe Institution of National Remembrance has created several board games to help educate people about recent Polish history\n\nOn 18 December 2006 Polish law regulating IPN was changed and came into effect on 15 March 2007. This change gave IPN new lustration powers. However, key articles of that law were judged unconstitutional by Poland's Constitutional Court on 11 May 2007, making the role of IPN in lustration unclear and putting the whole process into question.\n\nIn 2008, Adam Michnik said that the IPN is \"engaging in activities that destroy this memory. Today's memory police resort to the hateful methods of the communist secret services and direct them at a victim of this very secret service. These policemen violate the truth and fundamental ethical principles.\"\n\nConcerns have been raised of politicization of the IPN, starting with its legal mandate (no comparable institution in any other European country holds prosecutorial power) and continuing to its choice of staff, which at times tended towards particular political views.\n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of IPN is a by-product of its role in collecting and publishing previously secret archives from the Polish communist security apparatus, the Służba Bezpieczeństwa: revealing secret agents and collaborators (a process called \"lustration\"). One incident which drew criticism involved the so-called Wildstein list; a partial list of names of people who allegedly worked for the communist era Polish intelligence service, which was copied from IPN archives (without IPN permission) in 2004 by journalist Bronisław Wildstein and published in the Internet in 2005. The list gained much attention in Polish media and politics, and during that time IPN security procedures and handling of the matter came under criticism.\n\nThe election of a new IPN president in December 2005 was controversial. Janusz Kurtyka, the incumbent IPN president, was contested by Andrzej Przewoźnik. Przewoźnik's candidature received a severe setback after documents were found which suggested his possible co-operation with Służba Bezpieczeństwa, Communist Poland's internal intelligence agency and secret police. Przewoźnik was cleared of the accusations only after he had lost the election.\n\nPrzewoźnik and Kurtyka both died in the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash.\n\nIn September 2017, a historian in charge of education in Lublin for the IPN, wrote in a column in \"Gazeta Polska\" that \"after the aggression of Germany into Poland, the situation of the Jews did not look very bad\" and \"although the [Nazi] occupation authorities took over, they ordered the wearing of armbands with the star of David, charged them heavy taxes, began to designate Jews-only zones only for the Jews, but at the same time permitted the creation of Judenrat, that is, organs of self-government.\" In 2014, the same historian said in an expert opinion to a Polish court that the Nazi party was a leftist party and that the swastika is an ambiguous symbol. These statements were widely criticized by other historians including Dariusz Libionka, and the IPN issued a statement saying that the \"In connection with the thesis in the article by Tomasz Panfil in the Gazeta Polska, the Institute of National Remembrance declares that position presented there is in no way compatible with the historical knowledge about the situation of the Jewish population in Poland after September 1, 1939.\" and that it expects the historian \"will, in his scientific and journalistic activities, show diligence and respect to the principles of historical and research reliability.\" In October 2017, education minister Anna Zalewska presented the historian with a medal for \"for special merits for education\".\n\nIn October 2017, the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged the IPN to fire the deputy director of its publishing office because he had published several books by Holocaust denier David Irving. The IPN responded that the official \"is not a Holocaust denier himself so there is no reason to dismiss him\".\n\nIPN actions have also attracted support. In 2006 an open letter was published, declaring that:\nHistory of Solidarity and anti-communist resistance in Poland cannot be damaged by scientific studies and resulting increase in our knowledge of the past. History of opposition to totalitarianism belongs to millions of Poles and not to one social or political group which usurps the right to decide which parts of national history should be discussed and which forgotten.\nThis letter was signed by a former Prime Minister of Poland, Jan Olszewski; the Mayor of Zakopane, Piotr Bąk; Polish-American Professor and member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council Marek Jan Chodakiewicz; Professors Maria Dzielska, Piotr Franaszek and Tomasz Gąsowski of the Jagiellonian University; Professor Marek Czachor of Gdańsk University of Technology, journalist and writer Marcin Wolski; Solidarity co-founder Anna Walentynowicz and dozens of others.\n\n\n"}

Members of the ICOM get the ICOM membership card, which provides free entry, or entry at a reduced rate, to many museums all over the world. \n\nICOM adopted its ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums in 1986, a reference tool that sets standards of excellence to which all members of the organisation must adhere. The ICOM Code of Ethics for Museums, translated into 39 languages and revised in 2006, establishes values and principles shared by ICOM and the international museum community. These standards of self-regulation by museums include basic principles for museum governance, the acquisition and disposal of collections, and rules for professional conduct.\n\nIllicit traffic in cultural goods causes significant damage to heritage, particularly in regions of the world where cultural objects are most susceptible to theft and looting. Supporting the fight against illicit traffic in cultural goods is among ICOM’s highest priorities. In this context, ICOM publishes its Red List series to raise awareness on smuggling and illicit trade in cultural objects. The ICOM Red Lists are tools designed to help police and customs officials, heritage professionals, and art and antiquities dealers to identify the types of objects that are most susceptible to illicit trafficking.\n\nICOM has already published Red Lists for many different countries and regions:\n\nICOM is committed to providing cultural institutions with the necessary support and risk prevention tools when faced with conflict situations or natural disasters.

The national committees represent their members within ICOM and they contribute to the implementation of the organisation’s programmes.\n\nThe ICOM General conference is held every three years and gathers museum professionals from several countries. The first meeting was held in Paris in 1948. In recent years, General Conferences have been held in Seoul in 2004 (the first meeting in Asia), in Vienna in 2007, and in Shanghai in 2010. This 22nd General Conference in Shanghai followed the World Expo where an ICOM’s Pavilion was inaugurated and named “Museums, Heart of the City”. The General Conference was held in Rio de Janeiro in 2013 and in Milan in 2016. The next one will be held in 2019, in Kyoto.\n\nThe current ICOM President is Ms. Suay Aksoy. She succeeded Prof. Dr. Hans-Martin Hinz (2010-2016). The current director general is Dr. Peter Keller. He succeeded Prof. Dr. Anne-Catherine Robert-Hauglustaine (2014-2016) and Ms. Hanna Pennock (2013-2014).\n\nCIDOC, ICOM's International Committee for Documentation, provides the museum community with standards and advice on museum documentation.\n\nThe CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM), formalised as the official international standard ISO 21127, is used to map cultural heritage information to a common and extensible semantic framework. This \"semantic glue\" can be used to connect between different sources of cultural heritage information published by museums, libraries and archives.\n\n"}

They were supposedly related or part of the Pechenegs. Alternatively they could have been Kipchaks. The relationship of the \"Kangars\" (allies of the Eastern Turk Khahanate against the Western Turk Khaganate), if any, to the Kankalis, is unclear. Byzantine Emperor Konstantinos Porphyrogennetos (aka, Constantine VII) notes in his \"De Administrando Imperio\" that three groups of the Pechenegs are called Kangar. The name \"Kangar\" is associated with the \"Kang\" territory and probably with the Kangaris people and the city of Kangu Tarban, mentioned in the Kul Tigin inscription of the Orkhon Turkic peoples.\n\nThey first appear in history as a minor branch of the ancient Oghuz Turks. They formed one of the five sections into which the Oghuz khan divided his subjects. After the fall of the Pecheneg Khanate in the early 10th century, the role of the Kankali Turks became prominent. They were closely related to the Kypchaks. They may have been a separate nomadic people earlier but the Turkic peoples on the Pontic-Steppe became assimilated into each other by the 13th century.\n\nMany Kankali warriors joined the Khwarezmid Empire in the 11th century. In 1175 they, or some of them, lived north of Lake Balkhash and transferred their allegiance from the Kara Kitai to the Jin dynasty. They suffered heavy losses from Genghis Khan in 1219-1223. For example, all Kankalis in Bukhara who were taller than a wheel, were slain by the Mongols. Jochi subdued their relations who still lived in the land of the Kyrghyz and Kipchak steppes in 1225. Khwarizmi Kankali remnants submitted to Great Khan Ögedei after a long resistance under Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu against his general Chormaqan and governor Chin-temur. After the Mongol conquest, the remaining Kankalis were absorbed into other Turks and Mongols. Some of them who served in the Yuan Dynasty became Kharchins.\n\nThere are Kankali clans among the Kazakhs, the Uzbeks, Bashkirs, the Nogais and the Karakalpaks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1017229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1017229", "title": "Kit-Cat Club", "text": "Kit-Cat Club\n\nThe Kit-Cat Club (sometimes Kit-Kat Club) was an early 18th-century English club in London with strong political and literary associations, committed to the furtherance of Whig objectives, meeting at the Trumpet tavern in London, and at Water Oakley in the Berkshire countryside.\n\nThe first meetings were held at a tavern in Shire Lane (parallel with Bell Yard and now covered by the Royal Courts of Justice) run by an innkeeper called Christopher Catt. He gave his name to the mutton pies known as \"Kit Cats\" from which the name of the club is derived.\n\nThe club later moved to the Fountain Tavern on The Strand (now the site of Simpson's-in-the-Strand), and latterly into a room especially built for the purpose at Barn Elms, the home of the secretary Jacob Tonson. In summer, the club met at the Upper Flask, Hampstead Heath.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Kit-Cat Club\" is unclear. In 1705 Thomas Hearne wrote:\n\"The Kit Cat Club got its name from Christopher Catling. [Note, a Pudding Pye man.].\" Other sources give his surname as Catt (or some variant such as Cat or Katt): John Timbs (\"Club Life of London\"), Ophelia Field (\"The Kit-Kat Club\"), John Macky (\"A Journey Through England.\")\n\nA nickname for Christopher is \"Kit\". Christopher Catt was the keeper of a pie-house in Shire Lane, by Temple Bar, where the club originally met. His famous mutton pies (\"Kit-Kats\") were named after him, and formed a standing dish at meetings of the club; the pie is thus itself sometimes regarded (e.g., by Addison in the Spectator) as the origin of the club's name.\n\nIt is possible that the club began at the end of the 17th century as the so-called \"Order of the Toast\". Indeed, a famous characteristic of the Kit-Kat was its toasting-glasses, used for drinking the healths of the reigning beauties of the day, on which were engraved verses in their praise. If so, one can place the date before 1699, when Elkanah Settle wrote a poem \"To the most renowned the President and the rest of the Knights of the most Noble Order of the Toast.\" It was this very habit of \"toasting\" that led Dr. Arbuthnot to produce the following epigram, which hints at yet another possible origin of the Club's name:\n\nJohn Vanbrugh's modern biographer Kerry Downes suggests that the club's origins go back to before the Glorious Revolution of 1688; and that its political importance for the promotion of Whig objectives was greater before it became known. Those objectives were a strong Parliament, a limited monarchy, resistance to France, and the Protestant succession to the throne. Downes cites John Oldmixon, who knew many of those involved, and who wrote in 1735 of how some club members \"before the Revolution [of 1688] met frequently in the Evening at a Tavern, near Temple Bar, to unbend themselves after Business, and have a little free and cheerful Conversation in those dangerous Times\". Horace Walpole, son of Kit-Cat Robert Walpole, refers to the respectable middle-aged 18th century Kit-Cat club as \"generally mentioned as a set of wits, in reality the patriots that saved Britain\".\n\nAmongst the club's membership were writers such as William Congreve, John Locke, Sir John Vanbrugh, and Joseph Addison, and politicians including Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Burlington, Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, The Earl of Stanhope, Viscount Cobham, Abraham Stanyan and Sir Robert Walpole.\n\nOther notables included Garth, Charles Dartiquenave, Count Saint Germain, Steele, and the Dukes of Grafton, Devonshire, Kingston, Richmond, Manchester, Dorset, and Lords Sunderland and Wharton. Of some notoriety were Lord Mohun and the Earl of Berkeley. The artist Sir Godfrey Kneller was also a member, his 48 portraits in a standard \"kit-cat\" format of 36 by 28 inches, painted over more than twenty years, form the most complete known members list of the club. Many of these portraits currently hang in galleries created in a partnership between the National Portrait Gallery and the National Trust at Beningbrough Hall in Yorkshire.\n\nThe toasts of the Kit-Kat Club were famous at the time, and were drunk to the honour of a reigning beauty, or lady to whom the Club wished to do particular honour. We know by name some of those who were toasted: Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; Lady Godolphin, Lady Sunderland, Lady Bridgewater, and Lady Monthermer, all daughters of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, except Lady Mary Wortley Montagu who was the daughter of Evelyn Pierrepont, 5th Earl of Kingston-upon-Hull and only 7 years old when toasted; the Duchess of Bolton, the Duchess of Beaufort, the Duchess of St Albans; Anne Long, a daughter of Sir James Long, 2nd Baronet and friend of Jonathan Swift; Catherine Barton, Newton's niece and Charles Montagu's mistress; Mrs. Brudenell and Lady Wharton, Lady Carlisle and Mrs. Kirk and Mademoiselle Spanheim, among them. Those toasted had their names engraved on a glass goblet.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2420796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2420796", "title": "La Grange expedition", "text": "La Grange expedition\n\nThe La Grange expedition was a search expedition carried out in the vicinity of Lagrange Bay in the Kimberley region of Western Australia in 1865. Led by Maitland Brown, the expedition searched for three settlers who had failed to return from an earlier exploring expedition. The three men were eventually found dead, having been speared and clubbed to death in their sleep by Indigenous Australians. A number of Indigenous people were subsequently killed by members of the expedition in a controversial incident that is often now referred to as the \"La Grange Massacre\", although the fairness of this term remains a matter of some debate.\n\nIn 1864, an expedition was organised to investigate the story of a convict named Henry Wildman, who claimed to have found gold near Camden Harbour. The expedition found no gold, but good pastoral land was found, and as a result a small pastoral venture was later established at Roebuck Bay. In November 1864, three settlers, Frederick Panter, James Harding and William Goldwyer, set out from the settlement to explore the land around La Grange Bay. The expedition party had provisions to last only two to three weeks, so when they had not returned three weeks later, another settler, Lockier Burges, set out to find them. He tracked them as far as the mangrove swamp around La Grange, but there lost all trace of them.\n\nWhen news of the missing men reached the Government of Western Australia in Perth, a search party was immediately organised, with Maitland Brown appointed leader. There was some speculation that the three men had been killed by natives, and there were calls for their deaths to be avenged. George Walpole Leake, for example, wrote:\nFor this reason the expedition is sometimes referred to as a \"punitive party\".\n\nA boat, the \"Clarence Packet\" was chartered, and the party, led by Maitland Brown and including David Francisco and Lockier Burges, left Fremantle on 16 February 1865. On 25 February, the \"Clarence Packet\" anchored at the mouth of the De Grey River. Members of the party visited Walter Padbury's station for news on the missing men, but there was none. The party then spent nearly two weeks waiting for a native named Dutchmanchum to be found. Dutchmanchum was said to speak the language of the tribes in the Roebuck Bay area, so he was desired to guide the party. When Dutchmanchum was eventually brought in, he related a story that three white men had been attacked and murdered at a river called \"Boola Boola\" in the vicinity of La Grange Bay. Over the next few days, a number of other Aborigines were encountered that corroborated Dutchmanchum's story.\n\nOn 13 March, the party sailed for Roebuck Bay, anchoring off Cape Villaret on the 18th. Four days later, Brown took a number of members of the party over the Race Course Plains, where they captured five more Aborigines. These Aborigines again corroborated Dutchmanchum's story, and one of them, Lear-a-ban, stated that some Aborigines who were involved in the killings were camped near Cape Latouche Treville. Brown then decided to seek out these Aborigines.\n\nBrown's treatment of the Aboriginal people encountered up until then had been harsh, and at this point he wrote in his journal that he was prepared to arrest any Aboriginal people whom he thought guilty of the killings, but added:\n\nThe \"Clarence Packet\" was directed to proceed to Cape Latouche Treville, and Brown's landed party set out for the location on 27 March. Three more Aboriginal people were captured that day, and a large group the following day. Brown thought some of these men guilty of involvement in the attack, and sent ten of them aboard ship. One of the natives, Karimba, said that he could guide the search party to the remains of the murdered men, but after leading them to Boola Boola, he was unwilling to reveal any more, and guided them back and forth through the thickets for most of a day. Karimba had also managed to call to an Aborigine to bring men to rescue him, and the party found themselves being followed by a large group of armed Aborigines. \n\nEventually, Karimba was sent on board ship, and two other Aboriginal people, who were thought most likely to have been involved in the killings, were brought on shore to act as guides. These guides led them directly to the site of the killings. The three white settlers were found all dead. Two of them, Panter and Harding, had obviously been speared and clubbed to death in their sleep, as they still had their handkerchiefs tied over their eyes. The nature of Goldwyer's death was harder to interpret, but there were no signs of a struggle. The dead men's journals indicated that they had fought a number of battles with natives, and that they were expecting further hostilities.\n\nBrown had the bodies wrapped and packed for removal to the ship. While this was being carried out, the two guides tried to escape and were shot dead by Tommy, one of the native assistants brought with the party to act as guides.\n\nInstead of returning to the ship, the expedition continued to examine the country. Brown described this as further \"exploration\", but most scholars now agree that the evidence points to a punitive expedition. On 6 April 1865, Brown's party became engaged in a conflict with a large group of Aboriginal people. Most accounts state that the party walked into an ambush, but at least one account asserts that they attacked a native camp. Regardless of the cause, the outcome is not in dispute: at least six, and possibly as many as twenty Aboriginal people were killed, whereas the expedition party suffered no injuries.\n\nThe search party returned to Perth in May 1865. Panter, Harding and Goldwyer were given a public funeral. It was the largest ever seen in Western Australia; the funeral train consisted of some 750 people, and thousands of spectators lined the streets on the way to the East Perth Cemetery, where the men were buried.\n\nMaitland Brown returned home to public acclaim, both for successfully finding the men, and for avenging their deaths. Indeed, many settlers felt \"the requital Mr. Brown had inflicted on the murderers utterly inadequate\". The English Government, however, expressed the view that \"force had been exercised towards the natives without sufficient warranty\" and urged the necessity of maintaining friendly relations with the Aborigines.\n\nMaitland Brown died in 1904 and was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery, but in 1911 his remains were removed from Karrakatta and reinterred with the remains of Panter, Harding and Goldwyer at East Perth. Shortly afterwards, Pietro Porcelli was commissioned to create a memorial to Brown. The result was the Explorers' Monument, a bronze head and shoulders statue of Brown, on a granite base to which is attached plaques portraying the murdered men and describing the circumstances of their death. During the 1990s, the biased nature of the original plaques was recognised, and another plaque was added that describes the circumstances of the murders from the point of view of the Aboriginal people.\n\n\n"}

The film was selected as the German submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards, making the December shortlist of nine films, but it was not nominated.\n\nIn 1958, Johann Radmann is a young and idealistic public prosecutor who takes an interest in the case of Charles Schulz, a former Auschwitz extermination camp commander, who is now teaching at a school in Frankfurt am Main. Radmann is determined to bring Schulz to justice, but finds his efforts frustrated because of the many former Nazis serving in the government looking out for one another.\n\nRadmann's boss, the prosecutor-general Fritz Bauer, puts him in charge of investigating former workers at the Auschwitz camp. The U.S. occupation forces give him access to their files and he discovers there were 8,000 of them. He goes after Josef Mengele, who lives in Argentina but flies back to West Germany at will to visit his family. After the authorities block Radmann's attempt to issue an arrest warrant, his boss warns him off and orders him to concentrate on less high profile suspects. The department invites Mossad agents to visit, and shares its information with them. As a result, Adolf Eichmann is kidnapped and spirited away to Israel where he was tried, convicted and executed for his crimes. Having pulled off this coup Israel declines to pursue Mengele.\n\nMeanwhile, Radmann allows himself to be seduced by Marlene, a seamstress who benefiting from his connections is able to start a business as a dress designer. Radmann reaches a crisis when he discovers that his own father was in the Nazi party. When he tells Marlene that her father too was in the Nazi Party, she breaks off their relationship. By the end of the film however, there is a chance she will have him back. He resigns his official post and goes to work for an industrialist. There he is again confronted with the question: do what is right; or do what the system needs and requires you to do.\n\nWhen he finds this means working with a colleague who had defended a former Nazi he was investigating, he walks out, his idealism suffering from hard encounters with the real world - at every turn the \"system\" wants compliance, but he wants justice. He comes to understand that the only thing that can hope to confront the horror is not \"justice\", but attention to the lives and stories of those who suffered injustice. Growing out of the simplistic right/wrong moralizing, he comes to understand life as more complex and seeks to repair all the damage, large and small, he inflicted in his zeal.\n\nAfter going to Auschwitz to say kaddish, the Jewish mourning prayer, for a friend's two daughters who were killed there, he goes back to work for the West German state prosecutor. The film ends with the opening of the trial of several hundred former Auschwitz workers.\n\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 81%, based on 75 reviews, and an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Labyrinth of Lies\" artfully blends fact with well-intentioned fiction to offer a thought-provoking look at how the lessons of history can be easily lost or forgotten.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nAt 2014's Les Arcs European Cinema Festival, the film received a Special Mention from the Jury, and won the Prix du Public (audience award).\n\n"}

In his early youth he attracted the attention of the Bolognese rhetorician, Giovanni Garzoni, who volunteered to act as his tutor. He entered the Dominican Order in 1493, and after the completion of his philosophical and theological studies was called to Rome by his friend, the Master General, Francesco Silvestri. He served him as secretary and \"socius\" until the death of Silvestri in 1528.\n\nIn 1517, Alberti published in six books a treatise on the famous men of his order. This work has gone through numerous editions and been translated into many modern tongues. Besides several lives of the saints, some of which Papebroch embodied in the \"Acta Sanctorum\", and a history of the Madonna di San Luca and the adjoining monastery, he published (Bologna, 1514, 1543) a chronicle of his native city (\"Istoria di Bologna, etc.\") to 1273.

Many of the heraldic and historical facts are useless, however, since Alberti followed closely the uncritical work written by Annius of Viterbo on the same subject.

{"id": "286882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286882", "title": "Merry England", "text": "Merry England\n\n\"Merry England\", or in more jocular, archaic spelling \"Merrie England\" (also styled as \"Merrie Olde England\"), refers to an English autostereotype, a utopian conception of English society and culture based on an idyllic pastoral way of life that was allegedly prevalent in Early Modern Britain at some time between the Middle Ages and the onset of the Industrial Revolution. More broadly, it connotes a putative essential Englishness with nostalgic overtones, incorporating such cultural symbols as the thatched cottage, the country inn and the Sunday roast.\n\n\"Merry England\" is not a wholly consistent vision but rather a revisited England which Oxford folklorist Roy Judge described as \"a world that has never actually existed, a visionary, mythical landscape, where it is difficult to take normal historical bearings.\" It may be treated both as a product of the sentimental nostalgic imagination and as an ideological or political construct, often underwriting various sorts of conservative world-views. Favourable perceptions of Merry England reveal a nostalgia for aspects of an earlier society that are missing in modern times.\n\nThe concept of \"Merry England\" originated in the Middle Ages, when Henry of Huntingdon around 1150 first coined the phrase \"Anglia plena jocis\". His theme was taken up in the following century by the encyclopedist Bartholomeus Anglicus, who claimed that \"England is full of mirth and of game, and men oft-times able to mirth and game\".\n\nHowever Ronald Hutton's study of churchwardens' accounts places the real consolidation of \"Merry England\" in the years between 1350 and 1520, with the newly elaborative annual festive round of the liturgical year, with candles and pageants, processions and games, boy bishops and decorated rood lofts. Hutton argued that, far from being pagan survivals, many of the activities of popular piety criticised by sixteenth-century reformers were actually creations of the later Middle Ages: \"Merry England\" thus reflects those historical aspects of rural English customs and folklore that were subsequently lost. \n\nThe same concept \"may\" have also been used to describe a utopian state of life that peasants aspired to lead (see Cockaigne). Peasant revolts, such as those led by Wat Tyler and Jack Straw invoked a visionary idea that was also egalitarian – John Ball arguing for \"wines, spices, and good bread...velvet and camlet furred with grise\" all to be held in common. Tyler's rebels wished to throw off the feudal aristocracy (though the term \"Norman yoke\" belongs to a later period) and return to a perceived time where the Saxons ruled in equality and freedom. The main arguments of Tyler's rebels were that there was no basis for aristocratic rule in the Bible, and that the plague had demonstrated by its indiscriminate nature that all people were equal under God. \n\nEven in relatively peaceful times, medieval existence was for the majority a harsh and uncertain one – Lawrence Stone describing rural life as “at the mercy of disease and the weather...with money to burn today from the sale of a bumper crop, plunged into debt tomorrow because of harvest failure”. Nevertheless, the rural community was clearly prepared to play hard, as well as work hard (even if much of the surviving evidence for this comes in the form of official censure, ecclesiastical or secular). The festival calendar provided some fifty holy days for seasonal and communal coming-together and merry-making. Complaints against the rise in levels of drunkenness and crime on holidays, of flirting in church or on pilgrimage, of grievous bodily harm from the “abominable enough...foot-ball-game” all testify (however indirectly) to a vital, if unofficial medieval existence. Langland might castigate, but also provided a vivid picture of, those who “drink all day in diverse taverns, and gossip and joke there”, of the field-workers who “sat down to drink their ale and sing songs – thinking to plough his field with a \"Hey-nonny-nonny\"”. The wandering scholar, or goliard, who posed the mock questions of whether it was better to eat meat or fish, to court Agnes or Rose, belonged to a similar fraternity.\n\nMore legitimised recreation came in the form of archery, ice-skating, wrestling, hunting and hawking, while there was also the medieval angler, who “atte the leest hath his holsom walke and mery at his ease”. Above the town or village itself stood a semi-approved of layer of nomadic entertainers – minstrels, jugglers, mummers, morris-dancers, actors and jig-makers, all adding to first stirrings of mass entertainment.\n\nThus there was certainly \"merriment\" in Medieval England, even if always found in an unidealized and conflictual social setting. If there was a period after the Black Death when labour shortages meant that agricultural workers were in stronger positions, and serfdom was consequently eroded, the growing commercialisation of agriculture – with enclosures, rising rents, and pasture displacing arable, sheep men – meant that such social and economic hardship and conflict continued in the countryside through into Tudor times.\n\nThe Reformation set in motion a debate about popular festivities that was to endure for at least a century and a half – a culture war concerning the so-called politics of mirth. As part of the move away from Catholicism, Henry VIII had slashed the number of saint day holidays, attacking the \"lycencyous vacacyon and lybertye of these holy days\", and Edward VI had reduced them further to a bare twenty-seven. The annual festal round in parish society – consolidated between 1350 and 1520 and including such customs as church ales, may games, maypoles and local plays, came under severe pressure in Elizabeth's reign. Religious austerity, opposed to catholic and pagan hangovers, and economic arguments against idleness, found common ground in attacking communal celebrations.\n\nHowever a reaction quickly set in, John Caius in 1552 deploring the loss of what he called \"the old world, when this country was called merry England\". James I in 1618 issued his Book of Sports, specifically defending the practice of sports, dancing, maypoles and the like after Sunday Service; and his son Charles took a similar line. The question of \"Merry England\" thus became a focal point dividing Puritan and Anglican, proto-Royalist and proto-Roundhead, in the lead-up to the Civil War. Unsurprisingly, the Long Parliament put an end to ales, the last of which was held in 1641, and drove Christmas underground, where it was kept privately, as a form of protest; while the Restoration saw the revival of such pastimes (if not on the Sabbath itself) widely and popularly celebrated.\n\nAt various times since the Middle Ages, authors, propagandists, romanticists, poets and others have revived or co-opted the term. The celebrated Hogarth engraving illustrating the patriotic song \"The Roast Beef of Old England\" (\"see illustration\"), is as anti-French as it is patriotic.\n\nWilliam Hazlitt's essay \"Merry England\", appended to his \"Lectures on the English Comic Writers\" (1819), popularised the specific term, introduced in tandem with an allusion to the iconic figure of Robin Hood, under the epigraph \"St George for merry England!\":\nThe beams of the morning sun shining on the lonely glades, or through the idle branches of the tangled forest, the leisure, the freedom, 'the pleasure of going and coming without knowing where', the troops of wild deer, the sports of the chase, and other rustic gambols, were sufficient to justify the appelation of 'Merry Sherwood', and in like manner, we may apply the phrase to \"Merry England\".\n\nHazlitt's subject was the traditional sports and rural diversions native to the English. In \"Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England\" (1844: translated as \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\"), Friedrich Engels wrote sarcastically of Young England (a ginger-group of young aristocrats hostile to the new industrial order) that they hoped to restore \"the old 'merry England' with its brilliant features and its romantic feudalism. This object is of course unattainable and ridiculous ...\" The phrase \"merry England\" appears in English in the German text.\nWilliam Cobbett provided conservative commentary on the rapidly changing look and \"mores\" of an industrialising nation by invoking the stable social hierarchy and prosperous working class of the pre-industrial country of his youth in his \"Rural Rides\" (1822–26, collected in book form, 1830). The later works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge also subscribed to some extent to the \"Merry England\" view. Thomas Carlyle's \"Past and Present\" also made the case for Merrie England; the conclusion of \"Crotchet Castle\" by Thomas Love Peacock contrasts the mediaevalism of Mr. Chainmail to the contemporary social unrest. Barry Cornwall's patriotic poem. \"Hurrah for Merry England\", was set twice to music and printed in \"The Musical Times\", in 1861 and 1880.\n\nIn the 1830s, the Gothic revival promoted in England what once had been a truly international European style. Its stages, though, had been given purely English antiquarian labels—\"Norman\" for the Romanesque, \"Early English\", etc.—and the revival was stretched to include also the succeeding, more specifically \"English\" style: a generic English Renaissance revival, later named \"Jacobethan\". The revival was spurred by a series of lithographs by Joseph Nash (1839–1849), illustrating \"The Mansions of England in the Olden Time\" in picturesque and accurate detail. They were peopled with jolly figures in ruffs and farthingales, who personified a specific \"Merry England\" that was not Catholic (always an issue with the Gothic style in England), yet full of lively detail, in a golden pre-industrial land of Cockaigne.\n\nChildren's storybooks and fairytales written in the Victorian period often used Merry England as a setting as it is seen as a mythical utopia. They often contain nature-loving mythological creatures such as elves and fairies, as well as Robin Hood. In popular culture, the adjective \"Dickensian\" is sometimes used in reference to the same mythical era, but Charles Dickens's view of the rural past evoked nostalgia, not fantasy. Mr. Pickwick's world was that of the 1820s and 1830s, of the stagecoach before the advent of the railways.\nThe London-based Anglo-Catholic magazine of prose and verse \"Merry England\" began publication in 1879. Its issues bore a sonnet by William Wordsworth as epigraph, beginning \"They called thee 'merry England' in old time\" and characterizing \"Merry England\" \"a responsive chime to the heart's fond belief\":\n<poem>\n...Can, I ask,\n</poem>\n\nIn the late Victorian era, the Tory Young England set perhaps best reflected the vision of \"Merry England\" on the political stage. Today, in a form adapted to political conservatism, the vision of \"Merry England\" extends to embrace a few urban artisans and other cosmopolitans; a flexible and humane clergy; an interested and altruistic squirearchy, aristocracy and royalty. Solidity and good cheer would be the values of yeoman farmers, whatever the foibles of those higher in the hierarchy.\n\nThe idea of Merry England became associated on one side with the Anglo-Catholics and Catholicism, as a version of life's generosity; for example Wilfrid Meynell entitled one of his magazines \"Merrie England\". The pastoral aspects of William Blake, a Londoner and an actual craftsman, lack the same mellow quality. G. K. Chesterton in part adapted it to urban conditions. William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement and other left-inclined improvers. Walter Crane's \"Garland for May Day 1895\" is lettered \"Merrie England\" together with progressive slogans (\"Shorten Working Day & Lengthen Life\", \"The Land for the People\", \"No Child Toilers\") with socialism (\"Production for Use Not for Profit\"). For a time, the \"Merry England\" vision was a common reference point for rhetorical Tories and utopian socialists, offering similar alternatives to an industrialising society, with its large-scale movement off the land to jerry-built cities and gross social inequality.\nThis was also the theme of the journalist Robert Blatchford, editor of the \"Clarion\", in his booklet \"Merrie England\" (1893) In it he imagined a new society much on the basis of William News from Nowhere, in which capitalism had disappeared and people lived in a small self sufficient communities. The book was deeply nostalgic for a pastoral England of the past before industrial capitalism and factory production. It was widely and enjoyed worldwide sales, and probably more working class readers to socialism than William Morris or Karl Marx. \n\nAnother variant of \"Merry England\" was promoted in the \"organic community\" of F. R. Leavis by which he seems to have meant a community with a deeply rooted and locally self-sufficient culture that he claimed existed in the villages of 17th and 18th century England and which was destroyed by the machine and mass culture introduced by the industrial revolution. Historians of the era say that the idea was based on a misreading of history and that such communities had never existed.\n\n\"Punch\" in 1951 mocked both planning, and the concept of a revived Merry England, by envisioning a 'Merrie Board' with powers to set up 'Merrie Areas' in rural England – intended to preserve \"this hard core of Merriment\".\n\n\"Deep England\" refers to an idealised view of a rural, Southern England. The term is neutral, though it reflects what English cultural conservatives would wish to conserve. The term, which alludes to \"la France profonde\", has been attributed to both Patrick Wright and Angus Calder. The concept of Deep England may imply an explicit opposition to modernism and industrialisation; and may be connected to a ruralist viewpoint typified by the writer H. J. Massingham. Major artists whose work is associated with Deep England include: the writer Thomas Hardy, the painter John Constable, the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, and the poets Rupert Brooke and Sir John Betjeman. Examples of this conservative or village green viewpoint include the editorial line sometimes adopted by the British \"Daily Mail\" newspaper, and the ideological outlook of magazines such as \"This England\". Wartime propaganda is sometimes taken to reflect a generalised view of a rural Deep England, but this is perhaps to ignore both the competing views of ruralism, and the mix of rural and non-rural actually offered for a post-war vision of a better Britain.\n\nIn Angus Calder's re-examination of the ideological constructs surrounding \"Little England\" during the Second World War in \"The Myth of the Blitz\", he puts forward the view that the story of Deep England was central to wartime propaganda operations within the United Kingdom, and then, as now, served a clearly defined political and cultural purpose in the hands of various interested agencies.\n\nCalder cites the writer and broadcaster J. B. Priestley whom he considered to be a proponent of the Deep England world-view. Priestley's wartime BBC radio \"chats\" described the beauty of the English natural environment, this at a time when rationing was at its height, and the population of London was sheltering from the Blitz in its Underground stations. In reference to one of Priestley's bucolic broadcasts, Calder made the following point:\n\nPriestley, the socialist, gives this cottage no occupant, nor does he wonder about the size of the occupant's wage, nor ask if the cottage has internal sanitation and running water. His countryside only exists as spectacle, for the delectation of people with motor cars.\" (Angus Calder, \"The Myth of the Blitz\", London 1991)\n\nHowever, in \"Journey Through England\", Priestley identified himself as a Little Englander because he despised imperialism and the effect that the capitalist industrial revolution had on the people and environment.\n\nPart of the imagery of the 1940 patriotic song \"There'll Always Be an England\" seems to be derived from the same source:\n\nThe continuation evokes, however, the opposite image of the modern industrialised society:\n\nThe song seems therefore to offer a synthesis and combine the two Englands, the archaic bucolic one and the modern industrialised one, in the focus of patriotic loyalty and veneration.\n\nSome of the nostalgia associated with Merry England is reminiscent, both in its origins and its artistic influences, of the 19th-Century Romantic Nationalism which flourished in continental Europe and became integral to Nazi ideology. However, the Merry England vision never motivated hostility towards foreigners, nor nationalism, as did Romantic Nationalism before and during the German Nazi era.\n\nThe transition from a literary locus of \"Merry England\" to a more obviously political one cannot be placed before 1945, as the cited example of J. B. Priestley shows. Writers and artists described as having a Merry England viewpoint range from the radical visionary poet William Blake to the evangelical Christian Arthur Mee. The Rudyard Kipling of \"Puck of Pook's Hill\" is certainly one; when he wrote it, he was in transition towards his later, very conservative stance. Within art, the fabled long-lost merrie England was also a recurring theme in the Victorian-era paintings of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The 1890 News from Nowhere by William Morris portrays a future England that has reverted to a rural idyll following a socialist revolution.\n\nReference points might be taken as children's writer Beatrix Potter, John Betjeman (more interested in Victoriana), and the fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien, whose hobbit characters' culture in The Shire embodied many aspects of the Merry England point of view.\n\nIn his essay \"Epic Pooh\", Michael Moorcock opined:\n\nHere the shift has taken place: Tolkien was profoundly conservative with respect to cultural traditions, as Moorcock is quite aware, but not at all an imperialist. He set an area based upon the West Midlands region within Middle-earth, but made it apparent that its perimeter was maintained by external allies. The Shire seems to represent the comfort of childhood which Tolkien's characters must leave in order to grow into maturity and wisdom. In addition, in \"The Fellowship of the Ring\", both Gandalf and Frodo express frustration with hobbits' staidness and dislike of anything foreign or out of the ordinary, and even in \"Concerning Hobbits\" the narrator shows a certain degree of impatience with hobbits' general narrow-mindedness. Rather than a celebration of a narrow, anachronistic idealism, Tolkien's works hinge upon his characters moving beyond that place of idealism into a broader, more complex interaction with the world.\n\nFurthermore, in the chapters \"Homeward Bound\" and \"The Scouring of the Shire\" of Tolkien's \"The Return of the King\" the Shire is depicted as being far from idyllic or safe, largely due to the actions of lax, greedy, and venal hobbits, with the character of Sam Gamgee describing the Shire upon his homecoming as \"This is worse than Mordor.\" Of particular note with respect to the naturally corrupt nature of hobbits is the final chapter of The Hobbit, where \"The legal bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a long time before Mr Baggins was admitted to be alive again. The people who had got specially good bargains at the sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end to save time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture.\"\n\n\"The Pyrates\", the 1983 spoof historical novel by George MacDonald Fraser, sets its scene with a page-long sentence composed entirely of (immediately demolished) Merry England tropes:\nThe novel \"England, England\" by Julian Barnes describes an imaginary, though plausible, set of circumstances that cause modern England to return to the state of Deep England. The author's views are not made explicit, but the characters who choose to remain in the changed nation are treated more sympathetically than those who leave.\n\nIn Kingsley Amis's novel \"Lucky Jim\", Professor Welch and his friends are devotees of the Merry England legend, and Jim's \"Merrie England\" lecture somehow turns into a debunking of the whole concept (a position almost certainly reflecting that of Amis).\n\nA few popular music artists have used elements of the Merry England story as recurring themes; The Kinks and their leader Ray Davies crafted \"The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society\" as a homage to English country life and culture: it was described by AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine as an album \"lamenting the passing of old-fashioned English traditions\"; \"Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)\" also contains similar elements. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull has often alluded to an anti-modern, pre-industrial, agrarian vision of England in his songs (the band's namesake was himself an agrarian, the inventor of the seed drill).\n\n\"Merrie England\" is a comic opera by Edward German.\n\nRichmal Crompton's \"William the Bad'\" [1930] contains a chapter, 'The Pennymans Hand On The Torch', about an idealist couple who wish to return to Merrie England, as a staging post towards their ideal of living at \"the morning of the world\", which means dressing in flowing robes and (incongrously with the Merrie England concept, bearing in mind the traditions of English Ale and The Roast Beef Of Old England) being vegetarian and teetotal. The pageant they organise becomes a fiasco, largely, needless to say, on account of William's involvement as part of the dragon who fights Mr Pennyman's St George. \"The Pennymans'... pageant for May Day which involves St. George and the Dragon ... proves to be the first time ever that the Dragon (played by William) ever came out on top in the conflict\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "599965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=599965", "title": "Old Calendarists", "text": "Old Calendarists\n\nAn Old Calendarist is any Eastern Orthodox Christian or any Eastern Orthodox Church body which uses the historic Julian calendar (called \"Old Style Calendar\" or \"Church calendar\" or \"Old Calendar\"), proposed by the pagan Roman general Julius Caesar, and whose Church body is not in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Churches that use the New Calendar.\n\nThe \"Old Calendarists\" (who are also sometimes styled \"Old Calendar\") are to be distinguished from Eastern Orthodox Christians or Eastern Orthodox Church bodies which are \"on the\" Old Calendar. The latter use the historic Julian calendar cited above, but \"are\" in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Churches that use the New Calendar (the Revised Julian calendar). Thus, to be \"Old Calendarist\" or \"Old Calendar\" is not the same thing as being \"on the Old Calendar\". The Russian Orthodox Church, for instance, is not Old Calendarist (or Old Calendar), but it is on the Old Calendar. There are a great many Eastern Orthodox Christians who are (or who belong to Churches that are) \"on the Old Calendar\", but far fewer in number are the Eastern Orthodox Christians who are \"Old Calendar\" or \"Old Calendarist.\" It also should not be confused with the Oriental Orthodox churches, all of which are either \"on\" the Old Calendar or use their own calendar, but who are not in communion with either the Old Calendarists or mainstream Eastern Orthodoxy, although they are currently engaged in ecumenical dialogue with the latter. Nevertheless, inside the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem uses the Old Calendar in contrast to rest of the Armenian Church, which adopted the Gregorian Calendar while no member of the Armenian churches are using today the Armenian calendar. The Indian Orthodox Church uses the Gregorian calendar along with their autonomous Syriac Orthodox counterparts in India, the Malankara Jacobite Syriac Orthodox Church, in contrast to the rest of the Syriac Church which uses its own calendar. The Ancient Church of the East (Julian Calendar) emerged as the result of a schism when Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai introduced the Gregorian Calendar into the Assyrian Church of the East. \n\nThe Julian calendar, proposed by the pagan Roman general Julius Caesar, is commonly opposed to the Gregorian calendar introduced to Christianity by Pope Gregory XIII during the 16th century. An improved form of the Gregorian calendar, originally developed in 1785 and modified in 1923 by the Serbian astronomer Milutin Milanković, was first introduced by Greece for civil purposes only and later adopted by some Orthodox churches. In its present form it is known as the Revised Julian calendar and it will not diverge from the Gregorian until AD 2800 (see Greek Old Calendarists#History). A minority of Eastern Orthodox Christians regarded this as a surrender of the Eastern Orthodox Church to the Pope and continued following the old calendar. Some of these also broke communion with those who had adopted the new calendar, thus creating their own church, or denomination, which means in Latin \"to take a new name\".\n\nThis schism is the beginning of the Old Calendar Churches which suspended full communion or concelebration with other Eastern Orthodox churches (\"New Calendarists\") over the adoption by the latter of the Revised Julian calendar (called \"New Calendar,\" although some churches did not specify the details of which \"New calendar\" they were adopting). This is the most common use of the term.\n\nThose Orthodox Churches which remain in full communion with the New Calendarists and yet continue to use the Julian calendar include the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, the Russian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, and the Georgian Orthodox Church. (The Julian calendar is also used by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia which has reunited with the Russian Orthodox Church.)

It concerns the relationship between Saint Thaïs, once a courtesan of Alexandria in Roman Egypt, and Paphnutius the Ascetic, the hermit who offered her conversion to Christianity. The characters of the play lived during the 4th century. Much later in Europe, beginning in the early middle ages, the story of St. Thaïs also enjoyed a wide popularity.\n\nEvidently Hrotsvitha employed as a source for her play the \"Vita Thaisis\", a several-centuries-old translation into Latin of the life of Saint Thaïs (the original in Greek). The playwright, a Benedictine Canoness of Saxony (northwest Germany), drawing on the tradition, apparently created a narrative line and a distinctive character for St. Thaïs appropriate to the medieval Christian worldview.\n\nPerhaps unexpectedly, the play begins with a somewhat scholarly dialogue between clerics regarding the harmony inherent in the created world. The subject of concord sets the stage for the drama of the disordered life of the courtesan Thaïs. \"She shines forth in wondrous beauty\" yet she also \"threatens men with foul shame.\"\n\nIn the play Thaïs is presented as someone \"who was always eager to accumulate wealth\". The saint Pafnutius explains to his disciples that \"not only frivolous youth dissipate their families' few possessions on her but even respected men waste their costly treasures by lavishing gifts on her... .\" A modern writer observes: \"Hrotsvit's Thaïs became a prostitute because of her love of money. The root of her immorality is avarice, which in combination with her great beauty, resulted in her choice of prostitution as a career.\"\n\nAfter her conversion to Christianity she \"destroys\" 400 pounds of gold and burns other articles of treasure before her former patrons. Pafnutius exclaims to Thaïs, \"O how you have changed from your prior condition when you burned with illicit passions and were inflamed with greed for possessions!\"\n\nThe depiction of her conversion, her transition from courtesan to Christian, may appear rather truncated to a modern audience. Afterwards Pafnutius would describe the event to a brother religious: \"I visited her, disguised as a lover, secretly, and won over her lascivious mind first with admonitions and flattery, then I frightened her with harsh threats.\"\n\nTheir first meeting is presented in part as follows:\n\nPafnutius then bluntly condemns her actions as meriting damnation. Thaïs acquiesces to the view of Pafnutius without protest; she becomes anxious. Apparently, she had managed to hide from herself her knowledge of her sin. When Pafnutius confronts her, quickly Thaïs realizes her self-deception. Then she came to hear the discord within her that had caused her unbalanced life, with its disruptive results. She repents.\n\nAfter entering a process of spiritual transformation, Thaïs tells Pafnutius that \"All angels sing His praise and His kindness, because He never scorns the humility of a contrite soul.\" Thaïs burns her ill-gotten treasures; she then follows Pafnutius into the desert, to a convent where she will live under the guidance of the abbess for several years. There, in solitude, cloistered and penitent, she reviewed in a new light her former life and sought forgiveness.\n\nPafnutius here, in delivering the newly converted Thaïs to her to the place of her spiritual refuge and retreat, addresses the abbess of the convent in the Egyptian desert, concerning her recent past and her proper care:\n\n\"I have brought you a half-dead little she-goat, recently snatched from the teeth of wolves. I hope that by your compassion [her] shelter will be insured, and that by your care, [she] will be cured, and that having cast aside the rough pelt of a goat she will be clothed with the soft wool of the lamb.\"\n\nLater as death approaches her, Thaïs prays to God: \"Thou who didst create me have mercy on me... .\" Pafnutius also prays \"that Thaïs be resurrected exactly as she was, a human being, and joining the white lambs may enter eternal joys.\"\n\n\"The philosophical ideas of harmony throughout creation\" presented early in the play oblige us \"to interpret the sinfulness of Thaïs not as the triumph of evil but as an imbalance or discord between parts of her created being. Hrotsvit looks at this woman, who acts as a volcano of lust... . What she sees is... the discord of her \"musica humana\" of body and soul... . Once Pafnutius has guided Thaïs to actions that bring her body and its behavior into agreement with her knowledge of God\" there is \"concord between body and soul as the essence of the human being.\" Hrotsvitha's play is not without subtlety.\n\n"}
{"id": "25081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25081", "title": "Paradigm shift", "text": "Paradigm shift\n\nA paradigm shift, a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn, is a fundamental change in the basic concepts and experimental practices of a . Kuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a scientific revolution, to the activity of normal science, which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework (or paradigm). In this context, the word \"paradigm\" is used in its original Greek meaning, as \"example\".\n\nThe nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by modern philosophy since Immanuel Kant used the phrase in the preface to the second edition of his \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1787). Kant used the phrase \"revolution of the way of thinking\" () to refer to Greek mathematics and Newtonian physics. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of mathematics, physics, and biology revitalized interest in the question among scholars.\n\nKuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (1962). As one commentator summarizes:\n\nEven though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.\n\nAn epistemological paradigm shift was called a \"scientific revolution\" by epistemologist and historian of science Thomas Kuhn in his book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\".\n\nA scientific revolution occurs, according to Kuhn, when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is not simply the current theory, but the entire worldview in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it. This is based on features of landscape of knowledge that scientists can identify around them.\n\nThere are anomalies for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, that are brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject Karl Popper's model of falsifiability as the key force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To put it in the context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating Mercury's perihelion more troubling than the Michelson-Morley experiment results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, from that of the logical positivists in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.\n\nWhen enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm, the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of \"crisis,\" according to Kuhn. During this crisis, new ideas, perhaps ones previously discarded, are tried. Eventually a \"new\" paradigm is formed, which gains its own new followers, and an intellectual \"battle\" takes place between the followers of the new paradigm and the hold-outs of the old paradigm. Again, for early 20th century physics, the transition between the Maxwellian electromagnetic worldview and the Einsteinian relativistic worldview was neither instantaneous nor calm, and instead involved a protracted set of \"attacks,\" both with empirical data as well as rhetorical or philosophical arguments, by both sides, with the Einsteinian theory winning out in the long run. Again, the weighing of evidence and importance of new data was fit through the human sieve: some scientists found the simplicity of Einstein's equations to be most compelling, while some found them more complicated than the notion of Maxwell's aether which they banished. Some found Arthur Eddington's photographs of light bending around the sun to be compelling, while some questioned their accuracy and meaning. Sometimes the convincing force is just time itself and the human toll it takes, Kuhn said, using a quote from Max Planck: \"a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\"\n\nAfter a given discipline has changed from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a \"scientific revolution\" or a \"paradigm shift\". It is often this final conclusion, the result of the long process, that is meant when the term \"paradigm shift\" is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.\n\nIn a 2015 retrospective on Kuhn, the philosopher Martin Cohen describes the notion of the paradigm shift as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, Paul Feyerabend, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.\n\nA common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for relativism: the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal. Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is \"always better\", not just different.\n\nThese claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another—that they are \"incommensurable\". This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes—so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the philosopher Donald Davidson published a highly regarded essay in 1974, \"On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme\" (\"Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association\", Vol. 47, (1973–1974), pp. 5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are. Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on social science has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, \"Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity\". Cambridge University Press, 1993, .)\n\nParadigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system. \n\nIn \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", Kuhn wrote, \"Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science.\" (p. 12) Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time, as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a \"paradigm shift\" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.\n\nPhilosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it. \n\nSome of the \"classical cases\" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are:\n\n\nIn Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a \"tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals.\" Others have applied Kuhn's concept of paradigm shift to the social sciences.\n\n\nMore recently, paradigm shifts are also recognisable in applied sciences:\n\nIn the later part of the 1990s, 'paradigm shift' emerged as a buzzword, popularized as marketing speak and appearing more frequently in print and publication. In his book \"Mind The Gaffe\", author Larry Trask advises readers to refrain from using it, and to use caution when reading anything that contains the phrase. It is referred to in several articles and books as abused and overused to the point of becoming meaningless.\n\nThe term \"paradigm shift\" has found uses in other contexts, representing the notion of a major change in a certain thought-pattern—a radical change in personal beliefs, complex systems or organizations, replacing the former way of thinking or organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing:\n\n"}

Another was that the \"Titanic\"s owner, J.P. Morgan, wanted to eliminate several prominent bankers who were opposing his plan for the creation of a U.S. central bank.\n\nThe \"Titanic\" struck an iceberg, leaving a hole in her starboard side long enough to flood her front compartments to above the water line. The ship then sank, causing about 1500 fatalities.\n\nIn 2003, Captain L. M. Collins, a former member of the Ice Pilotage Service, published \"The Sinking of the Titanic: The Mystery Solved\" proposing, based upon his own experience of ice navigation and witness statements given at the two post-disaster enquiries, that what the \"Titanic\" hit was not an iceberg but low-lying pack ice. He based his conclusion upon three main pieces of evidence.\n\nOne of the most controversial and complex theories was put forward by Robin Gardiner in his book, \"Titanic: The Ship That Never Sank?\". In it, Gardiner draws on several events and coincidences that occurred in the months, days, and hours leading up to the sinking of the \"Titanic\", and concludes that the ship that sank was in fact \"Titanic\"s sister ship , disguised as \"Titanic\", as an insurance scam by her owners, the International Mercantile Marine Group, controlled by American financier J.P. Morgan that had acquired the White Star Line in 1902.\n\n\"Olympic\" was the slightly older sister of \"Titanic\", built alongside the more famous vessel but launched in October 1910. Her exterior profile was nearly identical to \"Titanic\", save for minor details such as the number of portholes on the forward C decks of the ships, the spacing of the windows on the B decks, and the forward section of the A deck promenade on \"Titanic\" that had been enclosed only a few weeks before she set sail on her ill-fated maiden voyage. Both ships were built with linoleum floors, but shortly before she was due to set sail J. Bruce Ismay, managing director of the White Star Line, inexplicably ordered the floors aboard \"Titanic\" carpeted over.\n\nOn 20 September 1911, the \"Olympic\" was involved in a collision with the Royal Navy Warship in the Brambles Channel in Southampton Water while under the command of a harbour pilot. The two ships were close enough to each other that \"Olympic's\" motion drew the \"Hawke\" into her aft starboard side, causing extensive damage to the liner – both above and below its waterline (HMS Hawke was fitted with a re-inforced 'ram' below the waterline, purposely designed to cause maximum damage to enemy ships). An Admiralty inquiry assigned blame to the \"Olympic\", despite numerous eyewitness accounts to the contrary.\n\nGardiner's theory plays out in this historical context. \"Olympic\" was found to be at blame in the collision (which, according to Gardiner, had damaged the central turbine's mountings and bent the keel, giving the ship a slight permanent list to port). Because of this finding, White Star's insurers Lloyd's of London allegedly refused to pay out on the claim. White Star's flagship would also be out of action during the extensive repairs, and the \"Titanic\"s completion date, which was already behind schedule due to \"Olympic\"s return to the yard after her loss of a propeller blade, would have to be delayed. All this would amount to a serious financial loss for the company. Gardiner proposes that, to make sure at least one vessel would be earning money, the badly damaged \"Olympic\" was patched up and then converted to become the \"Titanic\". The real \"Titanic\" when complete would then quietly enter service as the \"Olympic\".\n\nThe \"Titanic\" indeed had a list to port leaving Southampton. Inadequate trimming of cargo and bunkers would likely result in such and the crew seems to have demonstrated a lack of proficiency on several occasions. A list to port was noted by several \"Titanic\" survivors including Lawrence Beesley who wrote in his book about the sinking: \"I then called the attention of our table to the way the \"Titanic\" listed to port (I had noticed this before), and we watched the skyline through the portholes as we sat at the purser's table in the saloon.\" (The dining saloon windows were double rows of portholes covered on the inside with screens of leaded decorative glass with no clear view of the outdoors.) This was echoed by survivor Norman Chambers, who testified that after the collision: \"However, there was then a slight list to starboard, with probably a few degrees in pitch; and as the ship had a list to port nearly all afternoon, I decided to remain up.\"\n\nGardiner states that few parts of either ship bore the name, other than the easily removed lifeboats, bell, compass binnacle, and name plates. Everything else was standard White Star issue and was interchangeable between the two ships, and other vessels in the White Star fleet. While all other White Star Line Ships had their name engraved into the hull, the Titanic alone had its name riveted over top.\n\nThe plan, Gardiner suggests, was to dispose of the \"Olympic\", which had allegedly been damaged beyond economic repair in a way that would allow White Star to collect the full insured value of a brand new ship. He supposes that the seacocks were to be opened at sea to slowly flood the ship. If numerous ships were stationed nearby to take off the passengers, the shortage of lifeboats would not matter as the ship would sink slowly and the boats could make several trips to the rescuers.\n\nGardiner uses as evidence the length of \"Titanic\"s sea trials. \"Olympic\"s trials in 1910 took two days, including several high speed runs, but \"Titanic\"s trials reportedly only lasted for one day, with (Gardiner alleges) no working over half-speed. Gardiner says this was because the patched-up hull could not take any long periods of high speed. Perhaps this was due to the fact that \"Titanic\" as a nearly identical twin sister of the \"Olympic\" was expected to handle exactly the same, or perhaps the Board of Trade inspectors were in on the scheme.\n\nGardiner maintains that on 14 April, First Officer Murdoch (who was not officially on duty yet) was on the bridge because he was one of the few high-ranking officers other than Captain Smith who knew of the plan and was keeping a watch out for the rescue ships. One of Gardiner's most controversial statements is that the \"Titanic\" did not strike an iceberg, but an IMM rescue ship that was drifting on station with its lights out. Gardiner based this hypothesis on the idea that the supposed iceberg was seen at such a short distance by the lookouts on the \"Titanic\" because it was actually a darkened ship, and he also does not believe an iceberg could inflict such sustained and serious damage to a steel double-hulled vessel such as the \"Titanic\".\n\nGardiner further hypothesises that the ship that was hit by the \"Titanic\" was the one seen by the \"SS Californian\" firing distress rockets, and that this explains the perceived inaction of the \"Californian\" (which traditionally is seen as failing to come to the rescue of the \"Titanic\" after sighting its distress rockets). Gardiner's hypothesis is that the \"Californian\", another IMM ship, was not expecting rockets but a rendezvous. The ice on the deck of the \"Titanic\" is explained by Gardiner as ice from the rigging of both the \"Titanic\" and the mystery ship she hit. As for the true \"Titanic\", Gardiner alleges that she spent 25 years in service as the \"Olympic\" and was scrapped in 1935.\n\nResearchers Bruce Beveridge and Steve Hall took issue with many of Gardiner's claims in their book, \"Olympic and Titanic: The Truth Behind the Conspiracy\". Author Mark Chirnside has also raised serious questions about the switch theory.\n\nSome conspiracy theorists believe that the \"Titanic\" was sunk on purpose to eliminate opposition to the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank. Some of the wealthiest men in the world were aboard the Titanic for its maiden voyage, several of whom, including John Jacob Astor IV, Benjamin Guggenheim, and Isidor Straus, were allegedly opposed to the creation of a U.S. central bank. All three men died during the sinking. Conspiracy theorists suggest that J.P. Morgan, the legendary 74-year-old financier who set up the investment banking firm that still bears his name, arranged to have the men board the ship and then sink it to eliminate them. Morgan, nicknamed the “Napoleon of Wall Street”, had helped create General Electric, U.S. Steel, and International Harvester, and was credited with almost single-handedly saving the U.S. banking system during the Panic of 1907. Morgan did have a hand in the creation of the Federal Reserve, and owned the International Mercantile Marine, which owned the White Star Line, and thus the Titanic.\n\nMorgan, who had attended the Titanic's launching in 1911, had a personal suite aboard the ship with his own private promenade deck and a bath equipped with specially designed cigar holders. He was reportedly booked on the ship's maiden voyage but instead canceled the trip and remained at the French resort of Aix-les-Bains to enjoy his morning massages and sulfur baths. His last-minute cancellation has fueled speculation among conspiracy theorists that he knew her fate.\n\nAnother theory involves \"Titanic\"s watertight doors. This theory suggests that if these doors had been opened, the \"Titanic\" would have settled on an even keel and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no watertight doors between any of the first four compartments, thus it was impossible to lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No. 4 would have resulted in capsizing of the \"Titanic\", which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.\n\nLater, in a 1998 documentary titled \"Titanic: Secrets Revealed\", the Discovery Channel ran model simulations which also rebutted this theory. The simulations indicated that opening \"Titanic\"s watertight doors would have caused the ship to capsize earlier than she actually sank by more than one half hour, confirming the findings of Bedford and Hacket.\n\n\"Titanic\" researchers continued to debate the causes and mechanics of the ships breakup. According to his book, \"A Night to Remember\", Walter Lord described \"Titanic\" as assuming an \"absolutely perpendicular\" position shortly before its final plunge. This view remained largely unchallenged even after the wreck's discovery by Robert Ballard in 1985 confirmed that \"Titanic\" had broken in two pieces at or near the surface; paintings by noted marine artist Ken Marschall and in James Cameron's film \"Titanic\", both of which depicted the ship attaining a steep angle prior to the breakup. Most researchers acknowledged that \"Titanic\"s after expansion joint—designed to allow for flexing of the hull in a seaway—played little to no role in the ship's breakup, though debate continued as to whether the ship had broken from the top downwards or from the bottom upwards.\nIn 2005, a History Channel expedition to the wreck site scrutinised two large sections of \"Titanic\"s keel, which constituted the portion of the ship's bottom from immediately below the site of the break. With assistance from naval architect Roger Long, the team analysed the wreckage and developed a new break-up scenario which was publicised in the television documentary \"Titanic's Final Moments: Missing Pieces\" in 2006. One hallmark of this new theory was the claim that \"Titanic\"s angle at the time of the breakup was far less than had been commonly assumed—according to Long, no greater than 11°.\nLong also suspected that \"Titanic\"s breakup may have begun with the premature failure of the ship's after expansion joint, and ultimately exacerbated the loss of life by causing \"Titanic\" to sink faster than anticipated. In 2006, the History Channel sponsored dives on \"Titanic\"s younger sister ship, , which verified that the design of \"Britannic\"s expansion joints was superior to that incorporated in the \"Titanic\". To further explore Long's theory, the History Channel commissioned a new computer simulation by JMS Engineering. The simulation, whose results were featured in the 2007 documentary \"Titanic's Achilles Heel\", partially refuted Long's suspicions by demonstrating that \"Titanic\"s expansion joints were strong enough to deal with any and all stresses the ship could reasonably be expected to encounter in service and, during the sinking, actually outperformed their design specifications. But, most important is that the expansion joints were part of the superstructure, which was situated above the strength deck (B-deck) and therefore above the top of the structural hull girder. Thus, the expansion joints had no meaning for the support of the hull. They played no role in the breaking of the hull. They simply opened up and parted as the hull flexed or broke beneath them.\n\nBrad Matsen's 2008 book \"Titanic's Last Secrets\" endorses the expansion joint theory.\n\nOne common oversight is the fact that the collapse of the first funnel at a relatively shallow angle occurred when the forward expansion joint, over which several funnel stays crossed, opened as the hull was beginning to stress. The opening of the joint stretched and snapped the stays. The forward momentum of the ship as it took a sudden lurch forward and downward sent the unsupported funnel toppling onto the starboard bridge wing.\n\nOne theory that would support the fracturing of the hull is that the \"Titanic\" partly grounded on the shelf of ice below the waterline as she collided with the iceberg, perhaps damaging the keel and underbelly. Later during the sinking, it was noticed that Boiler Room #4 flooded from below the floor grates rather than from over the top of the watertight bulkhead. This would be consistent with additional damage along the keel compromising the integrity of the hull.\n\nA fire began in one of \"Titanic\"'s coal bunkers approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into its voyage. Fires occurred frequently on board steamships due to spontaneous combustion of the coal. The fires had to be extinguished with fire hoses, by moving the coal on top to another bunker and by removing the burning coal and feeding it into the furnace. This event has led some authors to theorise that the fire exacerbated the effects of the iceberg collision, by reducing the structural integrity of the hull and a critical bulkhead. Senan Molony has suggested that attempts to extinguish the fire – by shovelling burning coals into the engine furnaces – may have been the primary reason for the \"Titanic\" steaming at full speed prior to the collision, despite ice warnings. Most experts, on the contrary, disagree. Samuel Halpern, for example, has concluded that \"the bunker fire would not have weakened the watertight bulkhead sufficiently to cause it to collapse.\" Also, it has been suggested that the coal bunker fire actually helped \"Titanic\" to last longer during the sinking and prevented the ship from rolling over to starboard after the impact, due to the subtle port list created by the moving of coal inside the ship prior to the encounter with the iceberg. Some of these foremost Titanic experts have published a detailed rebuttal of Molony's claims.\n\n\n"}

Rheda is attested solely by Bede in his 8th century work \"De temporum ratione\". While the name of the goddess appears in Bede's Latin manuscript as \"Rheda\", it is reconstructed into Old English as \"*Hrēþe\" and is sometimes modernly anglicized as Hretha (also \"Hrethe\" or \"Hrede\"). \"Hrēþmōnaþ\" is one of three events (apart from the days of the week) that refer to deities in the Anglo-Saxon calendar—the other two being \"Ēostermōnaþ\" and \"Mōdraniht\".\n\nIn chapter 15 of his work \"De temporum ratione\", Bede provides information about English months and celebrations. Bede records that \"Hrēþmōnaþ\" is analogous to March, and details that \"Hrethmonath is named for their goddess Hretha, to whom they sacrificed at this time\" (\"Rhed-monath a Dea illorum Rheda, cui in illo sacrificabant, nominatur…\"). Bede notes that \"Hrēþmōnaþ\" occurs between \"Solmōnaþ\" (February), so named due to the offerings of cakes to the gods during the month, and \"Ēostermōnaþ\" (April), named after the goddess Ēostre.\n\n19th-century scholar Jacob Grimm notes, while no other source mentions the goddesses Rheda and Ēostre, saddling Bede, a \"father of the church, who everywhere keeps heathenism at a distance, and tells us less than he knows\" with the invention of the goddesses Rheda and Ēostre would be uncritical, and that \"there is nothing improbable in them, nay the first of them [Rheda] is justified by clear traces in the vocabularies of the German tribes.\" Grimm proposes a connection between \"*Hrēþe\" and the Old High German female personal name \"Hruada\". Grimm theorizes that the Old High German form of the goddess name \"Rheda\" was \"*Hrouda\".\n\nRudolf Simek notes that Grimm's derivation of the name Rheda means that Rheda \"could have a similar meaning to the eponymous Roman god of the same month, Mars.\" David Raoul Wilson comments that while \"Bede gives us no clues as to the rituals involved during \"Rhedmonath\" and \"Eosturmonath\", it is reasonable to assume that they related to the beginning of spring, the new growing season, and fertility.\"\n\nAppendix D of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\" contains a presentation of the Shire calendar, the calendar used by the fictional society of Hobbits. The calendar is generally based on the Anglo-Saxon one, and its third month is called \"Rethe\", modeled after \"Hrēþmōnaþ\", projected into the form the word would have taken in Modern English.\n\n"}

It is the second-largest population center in Castile–La Mancha. Its population of 83,303 makes it the fourth largest town in the region of Castilla la Mancha, after Albacete, Guadalajara and Toledo.\n\nThe city is settled along the river Tagus (Tajo in Spanish) at a broad bank. There are two islands in the center of the city called Isla Grande and Chamelo Island. The city is surrounded by two ranges of mountains, in the north the Sierra de San Vicente, and in the south Montes de Toledo.\n\nThe city is divided in two by the river Tagus. The northern part is the larger and more populated; both parts are connected by three bridges, one of them built in the Middle Ages.\n\nTalavera has a transition climate between the harsher continentalized mediterranean climate of the central table land and the mild-winter mediterranean climate of nearby Extremadura; Summers are hot and extremely dry and winters are moderately mild cool. Overall the climate is slightly warmer than Madrid. The area is very fertile with Mediterranean forests, elms, olive trees and cork forests.\n\nThe city is internationally known for its ceramics, which Philip II of Spain used as tiled revetments in many of his works, such as the monastery of El Escorial. The nickname of Talavera de la Reina is 'The City of Pottery' (\"La Ciudad de la Cerámica\", in Spanish). Mexico's famous Talavera pottery was named after the city.\n\nThere are remnants of prehistoric cultures in the area. The village was founded by the Celts as a ford of the Tagus. The first mention of the city (with the name \"Aebura\") occurs in Livy's description of a battle between the Romans and the Carpetanoi, a Celtiberian tribe. After the Roman conquest of Hispania, it was known as \"Caesarobriga\", one of many Celtic toponyms preserved in Roman Hispania, with a name connoting \"fortified\" that was extended to many non-fortified rowns: \"Caesarburg\". Caesarobriga served as an important center for agriculture and ceramics in the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE During the Visigothic period, Talavera reverted to a variant of its Celtiberian name: \"Elbora\" or \"Ebora\". Its modern name is derived from \"Talabayra\", the Muslim rendering of this Visigothic name. The city was conquered by Muslim forces in 713 and conquered by Christian forces under Alfonso VI of Castile in 1083.\n\nTalavera de la Reina was founded at the confluence of the rivers Alberche and Tagus. This area of great ecological wealth was the settlement of Celtic people who built the most ancient ruins of the area.\n\nDuring the time of the Roman Empire the name of the city was Caesarobriga. In 182 BCE Quintus Fulvius Flaccus conquered the city, establishing it as part of the Roman province of Lusitania as a city that would pay a stipend, and as the capital of an extended area included in the legal convent of the city of Emerita Augusta. The leader Viriato, in his war against the Romans, lived in this territory between 145 and 139 BCE. In this period Talavera de la Reina was a rich city with cattle markets and commercial exchange. Christianity came early to the city, and with the fall of the Western Roman Empire the Visigoths established in the city. Talavera was known then as (Aküis) or (Aibura). In the year 602, King Liuva II made a present to the city: the sculpture of the Virgin Mary, who was from then to the present day the symbol of the Christians in Talavera de la Reina, and the substitute for the goddess Ceres. In honour of the goddess Ceres, Talaverian Romans celebrated the spring festival called Mondas, which is still celebrated for the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe Muslims conquered Talavera in 712. They built new walls and a castle in Talavera. They also brought the use of fountains, water mills and new products brought from Africa and Asia. The fertile soil produced quality vegetables, fruits and grass for animal feed. The markets gained new strength, and the population, a mixture of Christians, Muslims and Jews, lived in harmony for some centuries. Medina Al Talavayra took part in different wars between the kingdoms of Spain, becoming allied with Córdoba and Badajoz. Talavera was the capital of an ephemeral kingdom or \"taifa\" (principality). After the city was reconquered in the 11th Century by Alfonso VI, it was an important trade center in medieval Spain.\n\nKing Sancho IV gave the royal privilege to hold two royal markets each year.\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, Talavera achieved great recognition, thanks to its pottery. \nWonderful pieces of pottery and Talavera tiles are found in the main museums of the world and in the most luxurious palaces all over Europe.\n\nTalaverian people participated in the conquest of America, like Francisco de Aguirre, Juan de Orellana and Jofrén de Loaisa.\n\nOther important Talaverian people were Hernando de Talavera, Isabella I of Castile's confessor, and the Admiral Francisco Verdugo. \nThe beginning of the 16th century saw the release of the most important theater work in Spanish literature, \"The Tragicomedy of Calixto and Melibea\", or \"Celestina\", written by the Talaverian mayor Fernando de Rojas.\n\nDuring this century the city lived in a golden age of arts and culture. Its main exponent is the father of Spanish History, Juan de Mariana, who wrote several books about history, law and politics, and who was very important for French revolutionary theories.\n\nUpon the death of King Charles II in November 1700, two powerful nations fought for the Spanish Crown. Talavera supported Philip V's French faction, which was the winner.\nIn 1750 the king founded the Royal Seeds Factories in Talavera, and 4,000 people worked there.\n\nThe war of independence against Napoleon's army had great consequences for Talavera. On July 27 and July 28, 1809 the Battle of Talavera took place between the Anglo-Spanish army and the French. During the fight the city was hardly damaged. The Duke of Wellington's army expelled the French from the city.\n\nThe city was getting large during the beginning of the 20th century. The railroad brought new opportunities for improvement. In 1931 the Republic was the new political system in Spain. Talavera changed its name to Talavera del Tajo. On July 18, 1936, when the Nationalists had risen in arms, the Republicans opened a period of terror in Talavera, killing people. On September 3 the Nationalist army conquered Talavera and reopened the terror, this time against communists and socialists. During the rest of the war Talavera de la Reina was damaged by the Republican bombing attacks.\n\nDuring the Franco period there was a recovery project by the Instituto Nacional de Colonización that created a large irrigated zone in Talavera, following which two new municipalities were created, called Talavera la Nueva and Alberche del Caudillo, the latter located in neighboring Calera y Chozas municipal term. During the 1960s a baby boom caused an increase in the population, added to by the immigrants coming from the nearby villages and poor areas of Extremadura.\n\nIn 1975 Franco died, and democracy came to Spain. Talavera's first democratic mayor tried to create the province of Talavera, but the idea was not successful. The next mayor, Pablo Tello from the Socialist Party, made large projects such as the Alameda Park.\n\nIn 1989 a feeling of marginalization enveloped the city, and a group of people called \"Nosotros Talavera\" (we Talavera) started fighting for the creation of a University Campus and other projects for the city.\n\nThe University started classes in 1994.\n\nThe city is located at the intersection of Autovía A-5 (part of European route E90) and N-502. It is on the railway route between Madrid and Badajoz. Talavera de la Reina's city bus system is Eborabus.\n\nTalavera de la Reina is the birthplace of footballer Manu Trigueros who plays for Villarreal and poet Rafael Morales.\n\nTalavera de la Reina is twinned with:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4016767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4016767", "title": "Theodore Draper", "text": "Theodore Draper\n\nTheodore H. \"Ted\" Draper (September 11, 1912 – February 21, 2006) was an American historian and political writer. Draper is best known for the 14 books he completed during his life, including work regarded as seminal on the formative period of the American Communist Party, the Cuban Revolution, and the Iran-Contra Affair. Draper was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the 1990 recipient of the Herbert Feis Award for Nonacademically Affiliated Historians from the American Historical Association.\n\nTheodore Draper was born Theodore Dubinsky on September 11, 1912, one of four children. His younger brother was Hal Draper, who became a noted Marxist historian. Theodore's parents were ethnic Jews who emigrated to New York City from Ukraine, then part of the Russian empire. His father, Samuel Dubinsky, was the manager of a shirt factory who died in 1924. His mother, Annie Kornblatt Dubinsky, ran a candy store to make ends meet following her husband's death.\n\nHe was raised in Brooklyn, New York and graduated from the borough's Boys High School. His mother insisted they change the family name to the \"American-sounding\" surname \"Draper\" when Ted was 20 so that the children could avoid anti-semitism during pursuit of their careers.\n\nIn 1930, Draper enrolled at the College of the City of New York, better known as \"City College.\" It was there that he joined the National Student League (NSL), a mass organization of the Communist Party USA targeted at organizing and mobilizing college students. This marked the start of a decade during which Draper chose to remain reliably within the Communist Party's orbit.\n\nDraper later recalled:\n\"My initiation came in the National Student League, which I joined in 1930... Most of its leaders were members of the Young Communist League, but I was not. I preferred being a 'fellow-traveler,' which was how I came to be around it. I was enough of a true believer to be convinced that whatever its faults or shortcomings, only the Communist movement was capable of making the 'Revolution'; a revolutionary, therefore, had to be close to it. Nevertheless, I was unwilling to give up a measure of freedom or absence of discipline, such as I could enjoy as a fellow-traveler.\"\n\nDraper noted that his non-party status \"may even have helped me, because it could show that one did not have to be a card-carrying Communist to hold a leading position in the NSL.\" Membership did come at a cost, however, as a decision was made by the Communist Party to distribute NSL members from City College, where the organization was strong, to other campuses where the fledgling organization had no presence. Draper was instructed to enroll at the Brooklyn branch of City College, forerunner of Brooklyn College, a decision which he later remembered as \"one of the saddest days of my life.\"\n\nDraper graduated from Brooklyn College with a B.S. in philosophy in 1933; by this time, the College's National Student League organization \"was so large and influential that it could virtually close down the school on May Day.\" Upon graduation he enrolled in the graduate program in history at Columbia University, which he attended for two years without taking a degree.\n\nWhile attending a social function in 1935, Draper was approached by Harry Gannes, the foreign editor of the Communist Party's newspaper, \"The Daily Worker.\" The editor asked Ted whether he would be willing to put his prospective academic career aside and to instead come to work at the paper as his assistant. After giving the matter careful consideration, Draper decided to accept the offer and went to work at the \"Daily Worker,\" where he remained for two years as assistant foreign editor, writing for publication under the name Theodore Repard.\n\nIn the summer of 1936 Draper was tapped to go to Moscow as the \"Daily Worker's\" correspondent there. He was ready to travel to Russia when he was suddenly told he couldn't leave because the party had learned that his brother, Hal Draper, was a Trotskyist, causing Soviet authorities to regard Ted as a security risk. The position of Moscow correspondent was subsequently offered to another \"Daily Worker\" journalist.\n\nIn 1937, Draper moved to the Communist Party's literary-artistic weekly, \"The New Masses,\" where he took a position as foreign editor and wrote for publication under his real name. The magazine sent Draper to Europe in 1938 to cover the tense geopolitical situation there. Draper spent time in Paris, in Czechoslovakia covering the crisis which led to the \"Munich Agreement\" between Adolf Hitler and Neville Chamberlain, and in Spain covering the last days of the Spanish Civil War.\n\nUpon returning from Europe in 1939, Draper was approached by a new fellow-traveling publishing house called Modern Age Publishers with an offer for Ted to write a book on the European political situation. Draper used the book advance as an excuse to quit \"The New Masses\" and he headed for Paris to conduct further research. Draper returned to the United States in November 1939, but the changing political situation — and the changing political line of the Communist Party in response to this — ultimately scrapped Draper's book project despite multiple re-writes.\n\nThroughout 1939 and 1940 Draper continued to periodically write for the \"New Masses\" on various topics at the request of the editors. With France falling to Nazi Germany in the summer of 1940, Draper was urgently requested to contribute an article for publication on the significance of the event. An article entitled \"New Moment in France\" was produced and published in the July 9, 1940 issue, in which Draper argued that the French collapse had altered the balance of power in Europe and hinted that the Soviet Union would be a likely next target of the Nazis in their pursuit of \"an ever widening circle of expansion for easy booty.\"\n\nDraper remembered:\n\"The article was delivered just before the deadline and must have gone in without much editorial deliberation. With everyone stunned by the French debacle, and no party line on it immediately established, my article had squeaked through. I was asked to write another article on the same subject for the following issue and attempted to say the same thing in even stronger form. But this time the party line caught up with me as a result of word from Moscow. The Soviet press let it be known that nothing had changed, there were no new problems or new conditions, no 'new moment in Europe.'... My second article was never published. It was the first time that any article of mine had been rejected. I was suddenly faced with the kind of personal political crisis that so many had confronted before and were to confront afterwards.\"\n\nDraper refused to write any more articles for the \"New Masses\" after that date, limiting himself to a few book reviews so as to avoid a total severing of connections with the Communist movement. He also spent a six-month stint as correspondent for the Soviet news agency TASS, before joining the staff of a short-lived French language weekly newspaper based in New York City. Despite being invited back into the fold after the June 1941 Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union validated his earlier prognostications, Draper felt this impossible and instead worked at a series of temporary jobs to make ends meet.\n\nIn 1943, Draper was inducted into the U.S. Army and was thereby \"saved from thinking any more about American Communism, at least for the next three years.\" Draper was put to work in the Historical Section of the 84th Infantry Division, ultimately writing the Division's official history of its activities during the Battle of the Ardennes in World War II. In 1944 Draper also saw the publication at last of a book on French affairs, when mainstream publisher The Viking Press released a book by Draper called \"The Six Weeks' War.\" Draper's transition from a political journalist to a historian had begun.\n\nFollowing World War II, Draper worked as a freelance journalist, writing extensively for \"Commentary\" magazine, a new publication of the American Jewish Committee, among other publications. In 1950 he began to write for a new bi-weekly news magazine called \"The Reporter,\" founded by Max Ascoli. Such writing tasks did not constitute full-time work, however, leaving time for Draper to engage in other literary pursuits.\n\nWith the growth of McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare, the subject of communism in America began to loom large in the public consciousness. Draper began to think of writing a \"traditional\" history of the American Communist Party based upon documentary sources and meeting scholarly standards and slowly began work on the project in his spare time. He was set free to work on the task full-time in 1952 by a grant from the newly established Fund for the Republic, set up as an autonomous organization by the Ford Foundation. Under the direction of political scientist Clinton Rossiter of Cornell University, the Fund for the Republic determined to publish a full-scale history of American communism. David A. Shannon of the University of Wisconsin was tapped to write the history of the CPUSA during the post-war period, while Draper was chosen to produce a monograph on the party's early years. Robert W. Iverson wrote \"The Communists and the Schools\" (1959) in that series\n\nRossiter allowed Draper two years to complete the entire project, the history of American communism from its origins in 1919 until the sacking of party leader Earl Browder at the end of World War II. Draper set to work, mustering sources and conducting interviews with living participants of the formative period of the American Communist Party. One of those with whom he conducted an extensive correspondence was James P. \"Jim\" Cannon, a midwesterner who was sacked from the organization in 1928 for supporting Leon Trotsky and the Russian \"Left Opposition.\" Draper noted that Cannon's letters soon became \"more formal, better organized, each a little gem of its kind.\" These letters of Jim Cannon to Ted Draper were ultimately published in book form as \"The First Ten Years of American Communism\" in 1962.\n\nIn the meantime, Draper finished his book for Rossiter and the Fund for the Republic:\n\"Two years later, I finished a book, but not \"the\" book... I woke up one day to realize that I had written a book which ended in 1923, a turning-point in the story... I was faced with a problem; 1923 was too far from 1945 to make up a plausible alibi. I could not expect anyone else to know what the significance of 1923 was and why it had become my stopping-point. Yet, somehow, without intending it, I had produced a book on the formative period of the formative period; it had a beginning, a middle, and an end; it was a book I knew, if the wrong one.\"\n\nDraper turned in the manuscript to Cinton Rossiter, who was irate about the truncation of the narrative but was in great need of a publication to show that the Fund for the Republic project was alive and functioning. The manuscript thus found print without revision as \"The Roots of American Communism\" in 1957 and Rossiter set Draper back to work for two more years to complete the rest of the assigned time period.\n\nTo his own dismay, Draper repeated the stunt, terminating the second volume with the 1929 expulsion of party leader Jay Lovestone and his co-thinkers. Again Clinton Rossiter protested and published, with the Viking Press releasing the volume as \"American Communism and Soviet Russia\" in 1960.\n\nA third volume was planned, for which Draper began assembling research material. Unfortunately, by this time the Fund for the Republic had run out of money and the story of the American Communist Party during the decade of the 1930s was left to be told by another writer at a later date. After several tries and failures to complete the task, Draper turned his research material over to a young scholar whose work he appreciated, Harvey Klehr of Emory University. Klehr's book, which made use of Draper's research material but to which Draper did not himself personally contribute, was ultimately published in 1984.\n\nWith his scholarly funding dried up and his interests shifting, Draper next moved to the hot-button topic of the Cuban Revolution as a focus for his scholarship. A series of articles, books, and pamphlets ensued, marked by the 1962 tome \"Castro's Revolution: Myths and Realities,\" published by Frederick A. Praeger publishers.\n\nDraper's work as a historian of the Cuban Revolution brought him to the attention of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace, an anti-communist think tank located at Stanford University. Draper accepted a Hoover Institution fellowship and remained there until 1968, at which time he departed, ill at ease with the growing conservatism of the institution. Draper moved across country to accept a similar post at the Institute for Advanced Study located at Princeton University, where he focused his scholarship on the question of race relations.\n\nDraper was a long-time contributor first to the magazine \"Commentary\" and later to the \"New York Review of Books\".\n\nSome of Draper's later works include \"A Very Thin Line,\" a history of the Iran-Contra Affair, and \"A Struggle for Power,\" a monograph on the economic and political circumstances behind the American Revolution of 1776.\n\nTheodore Draper died on February 21, 2006 at his home in Princeton, New Jersey. He was 93 years old at the time of his death.\n\nDraper's papers are housed in two locations. Materials relating to his two published books on American Communism and the Cuban Revolution are held by the Hoover Institution Archives, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California. An additional 63 boxes of material collected for his unpublished third book on American Communism, plus over 120 reels of microfilm and other research materials, are to be found at the Emory University Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Book Library, Atlanta, Georgia.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30630464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30630464", "title": "Vienna Museum", "text": "Vienna Museum\n\nThe Vienna Museum ( or \"Museen der Stadt Wien\") is a group of museums in Vienna consisting of the museums of the history of the city. In addition to the main building in Karlsplatz and the Hermesvilla, the group includes numerous specialised museums, musicians' residences and archaeological excavations.\n\nThe permanent exhibit of art and the historical collection on the history of Vienna include exhibits dating from the Neolithic to the mid-20th century. The emphasis is on the 19th century, for example works by Gustav Klimt. In addition, the Vienna Museum hosts a variety of special exhibitions.\n\nOriginally known as the Historical Museum of the City of Vienna (\"Historisches Museum der Stadt Wien\"), its existence dates back to 1887, and until 1959 was located in the Vienna Town Hall (\"Rathaus\"). The first plans for a city museum on Karlsplatz date back to the beginning of the 20th century; one of proposed plans were drawn by the renowned \"Jugendstil\" architect Otto Wagner. However, not least because of two world wars, the building of the museum was postponed for several decades.\n\nIn 1953, the City Council of Vienna passed a resolution to honour Austrian president and former mayor Theodor Körner, on the occasion of his 80th birthday by making the museum building a reality. A design contest was organised, in which 13 architects were specifically invited to take part (including Clemens Holzmeister, Erich Boltenstern and Karl Schwanzer) but which was open to any other entrants. Designs were evaluated by a jury which was chaired by the architect Franz Schuster and whose other members were the architects Max Fellerer and Roland Rainer, the Vienna Director of Building, the Director of City Collections, Franz Glück, the Head of the City Department of Regulations and the Head of the Department of Architecture.\n\n80 contestants took part and submitted a total of 96 designs. The jury awarded Oswald Haerdtl fourth place, but he was subsequently \"off-handedly\" contracted to design the building, which was executed in an unassuming contemporary modern style. Haertl was also responsible for the interior design, down to the furnishing of the director's office. The museum opened on 23 April 1959 as the first newly built museum of the Second Republic, and remained the only such for decades.\n\nThe Historical Museum repeatedly distinguished itself with its exhibitions. In 1985, under director Robert Waissenberger, it presented the \"Jugendstil\" exhibition \"Traum und Wirklichkeit\" (Dream and Reality) at the Vienna Künstlerhaus on the opposite side of the square; with more than 600,000 visitors, one of the most successful exhibitions ever held in Vienna.\n\nIn 2000, the courtyard was roofed over. In 2003, under the direction of Wolfgang Kos, the museums of the City of Vienna were united under the umbrella name of Vienna Museum and the Historical Museum was renamed Vienna Museum. In early 2006, the foyer was renovated and in addition, new exhibition space was created in what had been a storage area.\n\nThe main building of the museum presents a mix of historical and art exhibits with the intent of offering the visitor a cross section of the development of the city, from its beginnings in the Neolithic through the Roman camp of Vindobona up to the 20th century. In addition to the permanent exhibits, there are frequent special exhibitions.\n\nA memorandum of understanding and cooperation was signed in January 2000 with the Nagoya City Museum, establishing it as a partner museum.\n\nIn autumn 2008, to celebrate its 50 years in the Karlsplatz building, the Vienna Museum published a list of highlights of its history, including the following:\n\nSince 1971, exhibitions have been presented in the Hermesvilla, a former imperial residence in the Lainzer Tiergarten in the west of Vienna which Emperor Franz Joseph had built for his wife Empress Elisabeth in 1882–86. Under former mayor Bruno Marek, the building was restored by the Association of Friends of the Hermesvilla and subsequently taken over by the city. The permanent exhibition is dedicated to the history of the building and the imperial couple, who spent a few days there each year until Elisabeth's death. In addition, special exhibitions are mounted on a wide variety of themes in cultural history.\n\nSince 2005, a permanent exhibition on the life and work of Otto Wagner has been on show in this former Vienna Stadtbahn building.\n\nThe building was constructed in 1898 as one of a pair of \"Jugendstil\" pavilions on either side of the square as part of the construction of the Stadtbahn in the 1890s; Otto Wagner was the contract designer of the system. During the planning in the 1960s for the new Vienna U-Bahn nodal station at Karlsplatz, the two pavilions were saved from demolition, dismantled, restored, and put back in place in 1977 after completion of the construction work in the square. They no longer serve any transport purpose.\n\nThe \"Pavillon des k.u.k. Allerhöchsten Hofes\" (Pavilion of the royal and imperial court) in Hietzing near Schönbrunn Palace was built in 1899 to Otto Wagner's design as a special station for the use of the Emperor and members of his court when using the Stadtbahn. It was not included in the original plans for the Stadtbahn, but Wagner began construction on his own initiative and was finally able to win over the Minister for Railways, Heinrich von Wittek. In contrast to the other Stadtbahn stations, this pavilion with its cupola has baroque elements, which could be interpreted as a sign of respect for the Emperor on the architect's part. It was built at the inbound end of the platform at the Hietzing station, which opened in 1898; originally there were steps linking it to the public platforms.\n\nThe Emperor is only known to have used the station on two occasions: in 1899 when he opened the lower Vienna Valley line on the Stadtbahn (between Meidling Hauptstraße and Hauptzollamt) and in April 1902. Today the imperial waiting room and study and other rooms in the building are on permanent display.\n\nThe Prater Museum is located in the Prater park, in the planetarium building near the Ferris wheel. It presents the history of Vienna's largest amusement park, the Wurstelprater, with exhibits such as an old mechanical fortune-teller and coverage of dark rides and sideshows. The museum was founded in 1933 by the teacher and local historian Hans Pemmer in his home and donated in 1964 to the City of Vienna, which built the present museum. \n\nThe Vienna Clock Museum in the Palais Obizzi in the Innere Stadt, founded in 1917, is one of the most important of its kind on Europe. On the ground floor are displayed the collections of the museum's first and long-time director, Rudolf Kaftan, and of the poet Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach. During the Second World War, the \"House of Ten Thousand Clocks\", as it is also known, was closed and attempts were made to disperse the valuable clocks for safety to various castles in Lower Austria, with only partial success. After the war, work began on rebuilding the collection; thanks to funds from the City of Vienna and private donations, it has been possible to add a few additional rarities to the collection.\n\nThe Vienna Museum has a fashion collection in Meidling, adjacent to the Vienna School of Fashion at Schloss Hetzendorf. This is not open to the public, but the public may use the attached library, consisting of over 12,000 volumes and numerous periodicals, photographs and approximately 3,000 engravings on the subject of fashion.\n\nThe Vienna Museum includes numerous residences in which notable composers lived, were born and died, which are largely in original condition and intended to afford the visitor insight into the artists' everyday lives. Exhibits include music manuscripts, but also objects they used.\n\nThe rooms in the Mozarthaus Vienna in Domgasse, near St. Stephen's Cathedral, are the only one of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's residences in Vienna to have been preserved (and the original furnishings have not been preserved). Mozart lived here from 1784 to 1787, during which time he composed, among other works, his opera \"The Marriage of Figaro\", for which reason the house is also known today as the Figaro House. The flat has been open to visitors for decades; it was reopened in early 2006 after renovation. The house has several floors of exhibition space including objects such as the desk at which Mozart supposedly composed \"The Magic Flute\".\n\nLudwig van Beethoven spent the summer of 1802 in a house in Heiligenstadt, which at the time was a suburb of Vienna. There was a spa, where Beethoven attempted to reduce or cure his increasing deafness. During this stay, he worked on compositions including his Second Symphony, but also—in an episode of depression and despair about the state of his hearing—composed his Heiligenstadt Testament. According to oral tradition, the house was Herrengasse 6, now Probusgasse 6; this is however disputed, since at the time there were no registration records for the suburbs of Vienna and Beethoven's own letters do not mention the address.\n\nThe Eroica House is a memorial to Beethoven's stay in Oberdöbling in the summer of 1803, during which he composed a large part of his \"Eroica\" Symphony. However, Beethoven never stayed in the house. Josef Böck-Gnadenau misidentified the building, because he was unaware that the houses were re-numbered in 1804, rather than 1802. In 1872, Alexander Wheelock Thayer had identified the correct house: Hofzeile 15, which no longer exists.\n\nIn 1804–08 and 1810–14, Beethoven lived at the house of his patron Johann Baptist Freiherr von Pasqualati on the \"Mölker Bastei\" (Mölk Bastion, a remnant of the old city walls) in the Innere Stadt. Here he composed, among other works, the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, \"Für Elise\", the \"Archduke Trio\" and his only opera, \"Fidelio\". Since Beethoven's actual flat in the north section of the fourth floor has a tenant, the next-door flat is on show as the Beethoven exhibit.\n\nIn 1793, Joseph Haydn acquired the house which is now Haydngasse 19 in Mariahilf, and lived there until his death in 1809. The original address was Kleine Steingasse 71 (changed in 1795 to 73), and it was located in the hamlet of Obere Windmühle, which was part of the outlying town of Windmühle but was almost entirely surrounded by the larger town of Gumpendorf and was part of its parish. Here Haydn composed, among other works, the oratorios \"The Creation\" and \"The Seasons\". In 1862, the street was renamed for its most famous residents, and the house has been a memorial since 1899 and a museum since 1904. In one of the rooms, Johannes Brahms' composing desk is on display. In 2009, the 200th anniversary year of Haydn's death, the permanent exhibition was recast and enlarged; it emphasises the composer's last years.\n\nFranz Schubert spent the first four and a half years of his life in this house in Nußdorfer Straße in Himmelpfortgrund in what is now Alsergrund, the 9th district of Vienna. One important exhibit is Schubert's 'trademark' glasses. The house also has on display approximately 50 paintings by Adalbert Stifter, who was better known as an author.\n\nSchubert spent only the last two and a half months of his life in his brother Ferdinand's flat in Kettenbrückengasse in Wieden, where he died in 1828. Exhibits include his last drafts of compositions and a copy of the last letter he wrote by hand, to Franz von Schober.\n\nThe flat in Praterstraße in Leopoldstadt was the residence of Johann Strauss the Younger in the 1860s. Here he composed among other works the \"Blue Danube\" waltz, whose first notes traditionally inaugurate the New Year for the Viennese.\n\nThe Vienna Museum includes a number of archaeological sites which document various periods in the history of the city. All are located in the Innere Stadt.\n\nArchaeological excavations in the Michaelerplatz between 1989 and 1991 uncovered among other things the settlement of Canabæ associated with the Roman camp at Vindobona. This will have consisted primarily of the residences of soldiers' wives and children. The excavation site was made permanently accessible to the public in 1991; the design of the presentation is by architect Hans Hollein. \n\nThe Vergilius Chapel near St. Stephen's Cathedral was built around 1250, but in the 14th century became a crypt for a wealthy family. In 1732 the cathedral graveyard was abandoned and in 1781 the adjacent Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene burnt down, following which the Vergilius Chapel was filled in and eventually forgotten. It now lies approximately 12 metres under the Stephansplatz and was rediscovered in 1973 during the building of the U-Bahn; it is now integrated into the Stephansplatz station and can be reached from there.\n\nIn the Hoher Markt north of Stephansplatz, excavated ruins of houses which served as officers' quarters in Vindobona are on display, together with exhibits of ceramic ware, gravestones and other objects which illuminate life 2,000 years ago in the Roman camp and attached town. This museum annexe, previously known as the \"Roman Ruins\", was expanded and reopened in May 2008 as the Museum of the Romans.\n\nIn the cellar of the fire headquarters in Am Hof are the remains of a main drainage canal which once carried effluent from the southern section of the Roman camp to the brook which is now the street Tiefer Graben. Preserved in original condition, they were discovered in the 1950s during excavations for the foundations when the fire headquarters, destroyed by World War II bombing, were being rebuilt. At a depth of almost 3 metres, ruins of a wall of the Roman camp, a wall tower, part of a street which ran beside the wall and an approximately 5 metre stretch of the canal below the wall were uncovered.\n\nThe Neidhart frescoes are in a 14th-century building in Tuchlauben and are the oldest surviving secular wall paintings in Vienna. The cycle of paintings were executed in 1398 on the walls of a then banqueting room on a commission from the wealthy merchant Michel Menschein. For the most part they show scenes from the life of the minnesinger Neidhart von Reuental. They were discovered in 1979 under a layer of plaster when the building was being renovated, and have been on view to the public since 1982.\n\n"}
