{"id": "35801644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35801644", "title": "BBC Redux", "text": "BBC Redux\n\nBBC Redux is a BBC Research & Development system that digitally records television and radio output in the United Kingdom produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation. It has been operating since 2007 and contains several petabytes of recordings and subtitle data. It is notable for being the proof of concept for the Flash video streaming version of the BBC iPlayer.\n\nIt is an internal research project developed for testing which acts as a giant video on demand or personal video recorder (PVR). It contains a complete digital archive, recording both television and radio twenty-four hours a day, of all of the BBC's national and also some regional broadcast output since mid-2007, and is automatically compiled without human input. The BBC stated that BBC Redux is one of its major contributions to the field of digital archiving and preservation.\n\nSome accounts for accessing the system on a temporary basis were made available at Mashed 08 and again at Culture Hack Day 2011, providing streaming-only access to BBC content broadcast during the weekend of the event. As well as streaming, the system enables high-quality downloads of television and radio content, and has had the option to download subtitles from programmes since 2008.\n\nBBC Redux had originally been developed at the BBC's Kingswood Warren campus, in only two months, and with the investment required being significantly less than the iPlayer. The saved content can be used for broadcast compliance checking and by BBC programme researchers. , BBC Redux is only available to employees, because existing legal contracts with content producers limit how material can be broadcast, distributed and made available to general consumers. The Readme file for associated API frameworks hosted on GitHub states: \n\nThe system records over 100 megabits per second, continuously. , BBC Redux contained 300,000 hours of recorded audio and video. Not all regional variations are recorded; for BBC One, only London and Northern Ireland variants are recorded.\n\nA series of standard Digital Video Broadcasting terrestrial antennas and satellite dishes, coupled to DVB-T and DVB-S TV tuner cards are used to capture the incoming DVB multiplexes transmitted for over-the-air Freesat and Freeview terrestrial television. These raw MPEG transport streams are split into single-programme MPEG transport streams, encapsulated in RTP, and sent using UDP IP multicast within the IPv4 multicast address range codice_1 from codice_2. From the multicast streams individual television programmes can be extracted and saved, without requiring any transcoding or conversion of the contained MPEG-2 video data.\n\n, racks of Sun Fire T1000 and T2000 machines were used acquiring and storing the incoming programmes respectively; while commodity x86-64 computers were used for database operations and playback transcoding. The T2000 storage nodes are connected by 10 Gigabit Ethernet on the network side, and then by serial attached SCSI to RAID boxes containing high-capacity commodity Serial ATA hard disk drives. The \"fsck-free\" ZFS file system is used after experiments with Unix File System (UFS) proved it to be too slow. Sun Microsystems had to manually repair the filesystems on two occasions using Unix codice_3.\n\nThe software is based on open source technologies, and uses a combination of codice_4 and C running on OpenSolaris. A series of \"lolcat\" images are used for the system's HTTP 404 and error pages.\n\nAs part of the European Union (EU) \"NoTube\" project running between 2009–12. a recommendation research system using Lonclass categorisation and Tanimoto coefficient matching was tested by the BBC R&D Audience Experience team and integrated with 23,000 recordings delivered from Redux. The matching dataset was gathered over a period of five months.\n\nFor a BBC Digital Media Initiative (DMI) demonstration entitled \"Million Minutes\", files from the BBC's D-3 video tape archive were imported into the Redux system during 2009–2010. This also used commercial software from Artesia Digital Media Group and involved creating a representational state transfer (REST) interface onto the content stored within Redux.\n\nDuring 2010, Safari and Google Chrome browser extensions were developed to integrate Redux content with the main www.bbc.co.uk/programmes directory.\n\nIn January 2012, the BBC's Multimedia Classification team announced they were hoping to test and add \"mood-based navigation\" to the existing BBC Redux interface, along with audience measurement and other rich metadata comprising work part-funded by the Technology Strategy Board. During 2010–2011 BBC Research and Development integrated content archived in BBC Redux with the BBC's existing internal BBC InFax system, allowing finding of metadata and archive content within the same browser window, covering news and subtitles from over the previous five years.\n\nDuring March 2012, the Atlas index changed the method of equivalence matching used for indexing against BBC Redux.\n"}

{"id": "14395146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14395146", "title": "Berlinka (art collection)", "text": "Berlinka (art collection)\n\nThe Berlinka ('Berliner'), also Pruski skarb ('Prussian Treasure'), is the Polish name for a collection of German original manuscripts originally kept at the Prussian State Library in Berlin, which since the end of World War II are held by the Jagiellonian Library in Kraków. The legal status of the documents is subject of an ongoing debate.\n\nDuring the Second World War from September 1942 onwards, German authorities moved the material from Berlin to the seized abbey of Grüssau (present-day Krzeszów) in Prussian Lower Silesia, in order to protect it from Allied strategic bombing. When the Lower Silesian territory east of the Oder–Neisse line fell under the administrative sovereignty of the Republic of Poland after the war, the Polish government secretly claimed the collection as war reparations. In the winter of 1945/1946, the inventories were removed by Polish \"milicja\" and thereafter transferred to Kraków.\n\nIn 1965, the Polish and the East German government signed an agreement on the return of large collections of the Prussian State Library; however, the Polish authorities kept the \"Berlinka\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s existence at the Jagiellonian Library a secret until 1977, when Polish First Secretary Edward Gierek presenting his East German counterpart Erich Honecker with seven pieces of sheet music, including Mozart's original score of \"The Magic Flute\" and Beethoven's notes for his Symphony No. 9, as a gift.\n\nSince the jurisdiction of the former eastern territories of Germany was withdrawn by the 1945 Potsdam Agreement, Poland claims that it should retain ownership of the \"Berlinka\" as compensation for Polish cultural assets destroyed or looted by Germans during the Second World War; the total worth of Polish cultural heritage destroyed by Nazi Germany, especially after the failed Warsaw Uprising in 1944, is estimated at 20 billion dollars. Some German media have referred to the \"Berlinka\" as the \"last German prisoner of war\". The German government claims that Poland is in violation of Article 56 of the Hague Convention of 1907, while the Polish side emphasizes the fact that the collections were not looted, but were situated on Polish territory after the war.\n\nAfter the Revolutions of 1989, the Polish–German Treaty of Good Neighbourship was signed in 1991 and several negotiations have taken place in order to clarify and confirm the whereabouts of the \"Berlinka\". Poland has undertaken several initiatives, such as in 2000 when Foreign Minister Władysław Bartoszewski proposed establishing a Polish–German foundation that would take possession of such disputed collections. However, the German government refused – according to Bartoszewski, resulting from the fact that Chancellor Gerhard Schröder did not realise the offer. While Germany each time is demanding that Poland return the \"Berlinka\" unconditionally, Poland refuses, claiming that Germany still has much Polish material looted during World War II, and that this should be returned to Poland in exchange.\n\nIn summer 2007, \"Der Spiegel\" magazine quoted German Foreign Office representative Julia Gross as saying that proceedings over the disposition had reached a low point. Earlier, Poland had stated that return is out of the question. In 2014 Germany returned to Poland the looted painting \"Palace Stairs\" by Francesco Guardi. With this gesture, Germany hopes to restart negotiations for the return of \"Berlinka\".\n\nThe \"Berlinka\" comprises some of the most valuable holdings of the former Prussian State Library. It includes over 500,000 medieval manuscripts, early modern printings and autographs, including by Luther and Calvin, Goethe and Schiller, Hegel, and Herder. Among the holdings are notable letters from the large estate of Ludmilla Assing and her uncle Karl August Varnhagen von Ense, personal copies of the \"Deutsches Wörterbuch\" with hand-written notes by the Brothers Grimm and original musical scores by Johann Sebastian Bach and his sons, Mozart (\"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\"), Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, Schumann, Haydn, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, Paganini, Busoni, Cherubini, and Telemann. On the other hand, the collections also comprise many manuscripts and incunables from Polish monasteries in Gniezno, Lubiń, Mogilno, Pakość, Paradyż, Pelplin and Poznań, removed between 1820 and 1840 by Prussian authorities from the territories gained in the Partitions of Poland.\n\nListed under separate provenance, the collections today are accessible for researchers and post-graduate students only. After a number of incunables from the Jagiellonian Library were found at auctions, user conditions were tightened again in 1999.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2126537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2126537", "title": "Boy Scout Handbook", "text": "Boy Scout Handbook\n\nBoy Scout Handbook is the official handbook of the Boy Scouts of America. It is a descendant of Baden-Powell's original handbook, \"Scouting for Boys\", which has been the basis for Scout handbooks in many countries, with some variations to the text of the book depending on each country's codes and customs.\n\nThe original edition of the handbook was based on Baden-Powell's work. Ernest Thompson Seton combined his Woodcraft manual, the \"Birch Bark Rolls\", with Baden-Powell's \"Scouting for Boys\". Subsequent works were done by other authors. William \"Green Bar Bill\" Hillcourt wrote the 6th, 7th, and 9th editions. Frederick L. Hines wrote the 8th, and Robert Birkby the 10th, 11th and 12th editions.\n\nThe first \"Official Handbook\", subtitled \"A Handbook of Woodcraft, Scouting, and Life-craft\" was published from July 1910 until March 1911 and appeared in eight distinct variations. It was written by Ernest Seton and drew greatly on Baden-Powell's \"Scouting for Boys\", it included information on the organization of Scouting, signs and signaling, and camping, as well as Scouting games and a description of several Scouting honours. Notably, this book did not place emphasis on first aid, knife and axe use, or map and compass work, as later editions would. Because this edition was intended solely as a temporary guide until an authoritative handbook could be made, it is now known as the \"1910 Original Edition Handbook\". The cover art was an illustration by Baden-Powell. There were about 28,000 copies printed, not 68,900 as previously thought.\n\n\"The Official Handbook for Boys\" was published in June 1911. In this edition, the American Scouting program was standardized, albeit with many omissions and mistakes (cf. external links). As with the \"Original Edition\", many now-standard Scouting skills were passed over, including knife and axe use and map and compass work.\n\nThe book describes many Scout-like virtues and qualifications. After a lengthy section on what a Scout should know, including chivalry, history, and national issues, it is noted that \"in short, to be a good Scout is to be a well-developed, well-informed boy.\"\n\nDates and names of the various editions are:\n\n"}

{"id": "40867001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40867001", "title": "Ciyuan", "text": "Ciyuan\n\nThe Ciyuan or Tz'u-yüan is the earliest modern encyclopedic Chinese phrase dictionary. The Commercial Press published the first edition \"Ciyuan\" in 1915, and reissued it in various formats, including a 1931 supplement, and a fully revised 1979-1984 edition. The latest (3rd) edition was issued in 2015 to commemorate the centenary anniversary of its first publication.\n\nIn terms of Chinese lexicography, the \"Ciyuan\" is a \"cidian\" ( \"word/phrase dictionary\") for spoken expressions, as opposed to a \"zidian\" (, lit. \"character/logograph dictionary\") for written Chinese characters.\n\nThe title word \"ciyuan\" 辭源 – which combines \"ci\" 辭 \"take leave; decline; diction; phrase; word\" and \"yuan\" 源 \"source; cause; origin\" – is an old variant for \"ciyuan\" 詞源 \"word origin; etymology\", usually written with \"ci\" 詞 \"word; term; speech\".\n\nThe \"Ciyuan\" has been popular with Chinese intellectuals. For example, (Reed 2011:3), during the Chinese Civil War, Mao Zedong carried two modern dictionaries, the \"Ciyuan\" and the \"Cihai\".\n\nThe lexicographer Reinhard Hartmann (2003:16) predicts that the revised \"Ciyuan\" \"should remain a basic research tool for all students of China's pre-modern literature and history for many years to come.\"\n\nThe \"Ciyuan\", which is the first major Chinese dictionary of the 20th century, has been republished and revised repeatedly.\n\nChinese lexicographers began compiling the first edition \"Ciyuan\" in 1908, with Lu Erkui (陸爾奎, 1862-1935) as editor-in-chief. They chiefly derived material from the 1710 \"Kangxi Dictionary\" and 1798 \"Jingji cuangu\" (經籍簒詁) dictionary of characters used in the Chinese classics. In 1915, Commercial Press, a major Chinese publishing house, issued the original \"Ciyuan\" in two volumes totaling 3,087 pages, available in large, medium, and small sizes (Teng & Biggerstaff 1971:132).\n\nIt contained approximately 100,000 entries (Hartmann 2003:165), with dictionary order by individual character head entries arranged by radical and stroke, using the traditional 214 Kangxi radicals. Phrase and compound entries are grouped under their first character, arranged firstly according to their number of characters, and secondly according to their radicals.\n\nThe \"Ciyuan\" included not only Chinese characters and phrases, but also \"chengyu\" idioms, classical references, and encyclopedic terms, such as Chinese and foreign personal and place names, book titles, and modern scientific terms. \nIts preface explained the lexicographical need for the \"Ciyuan\".\nIn recent years new terms and new affairs have flooded into China. People from less-informed backgrounds find it hard to understand what \"new learning\" is about because of terms that are incomprehensible. Those who had classical knowledge often ended up giving up on new learning. On the other hand, those who went to study abroad did not understand what had already existed in their homeland when they returned. We therefore published this dictionary to indicate the history of and changes in the meanings of words, in the hopes of bridging that gap. (tr. Yue 2006:52) \nEach entry was followed by its pronunciation (with \"fanqie\" spelling, a common homophone, and modern Chinese rhyme), meanings, and often with illustrative quotations from the Chinese classics. However, as Têng Ssu-yü and Knight Biggerstaff (1971:132) say, the first edition \"Ciyuan\" \"is far from exhaustive, and most of its illustrative quotations were taken from secondary sources without being checked.\"\n\nIn 1931 Commercial Press published the \"Ciyuan xubian\" (辭源續編 \"Source of words continuation/sequel\"), compiled by Fang Yi (方毅, 1916-1997) and others, in two volumes totaling 1,702 pages (Teng & Biggerstaff 1971:132). This supplementary dictionary comprises terms accidentally omitted from the 1915 edition, and new terms coined after it. Fang Yi's preface explained the reason for publishing an extended edition of the \"Ciyuan\" in 1931: \"Within more than a decade and following progressive developments in the world and changes within the political scene, it is natural that in science many new words have emerged\" (tr. Tsou 1990:357). The \"Xubian\" also cites sources of quotations in more detail than the core \"Ciyuan\" dictionary.\n\nThe 1939 \"Ciyuan Zhengxu heding ben\" (辭源正續合訂本) was a new extended edition, combined into one volume (Yang 1985:275). The 1931 \"Ciyuan\" had 65,555 entries and the 1939 edition has 88,074, nearly a 35% net increase in words (Tsou 1990:358).\n\nIn 1969, Commercial Press in Taiwan published a one volume edition, with a Four-Corner Method index (Yang 1985:277).\n\nPlans for a second edition \"Ciyuan\" began after a 1958 conference about revising the \"Ciyuan\" and \"Cihai\" dictionaries. Hartmann (2003:16) says, \"It was decided to maintain \"Ciyuan\" 's emphasis on literary, historical and classical terms and to revise and augment it as a reference work for researchers and students of pre-modern Chinese.\"\n\nIn 1964, a \"weidinggao\" (未定稿 \"draft manuscript\") \"Ciyuan\" was completed, but the anti-intellectualism of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) halted compilation. Work resumed in 1976 as a cooperative effort between the Commercial Press and language scholars in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Henan. The revised Volumes 1 through 4 were published in 1979, 1980, 1981, and 1984, respectively. The revised edition \"Ciyuan\" contains 12,980 head characters, under which are 84,134 definitions of phrases, totaling 11.3 million characters (Huang 1993:241). Volume 4 has a pinyin index attached.\n\nContent of the new \"Ciyuan\" focuses on classical terms and encyclopedic items relating to Chinese literature and history up to 1840, the time of the First Opium War (Wilkinson 2000:78). The editors deleted technical terms from natural and social sciences, and international words that had been appended into the original edition \"Ciyuan\" during 60 years of revisions and updates. They also added a number of important terms; for example (Hartmann 2003:16), \"under the character \"wei\" ([委] \"entrust; committee\"), the original edition had 49 compounds, while the revised edition deletes 12 of these but adds 29 more.\" Since citations in the first edition \"Ciyuan\" were sometimes unclear as to sources, the editors of the revised edition rechecked every citation, corrected errors, and added references for authors and chapter numbers.\n\nIn 1988, Commercial Press published a reduced-size, single volume edition \"Ciyuan\".\n\nThe third edition (辞源(第三版)) was published in 2015 following 8 years of editing.()()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first edition, published in 1994, contained about a million words, nearly five hundred illustrations, and had 126 contributors, ranging from Derick Thomson to David Steel, from Alan Bold to Neil MacCormick and from Joy Hendry to Sir William Macpherson of Cluny. It has four thousand individual entries, and an index indicating further references in other articles.\n\nIn the original edition, the first entry is Aaron Scotus, and the last on the marquisate of Zetland (the only Z entry).\n\nThe aim seems to have been to have reasonably brief entries on most topics, but subjects that get lengthier ones, include Scotland's major cities (including the traditional city of Perth), association football and rugby in Scotland, the Scottish Gaelic language, Scots law etc. A wide variety of topics are dealt with, including figures from science, literature, philosophy, sport and history.\n\nLess \"obvious\" topics which have entries include the Roman general Agricola (who tried to invade Scotland), the hooded crow, Berwick-upon-Tweed (which has a stormy past, lying right on the Anglo-Scottish Border) and medicinal plants.\n\nSeveral appendices cover the schisms (and mergers) of Scottish Presbyterian factions from 1700 to the date of publication, and also the Scottish royal line.\n\nThe second edition in 2000 contained over a hundred new articles, amongst them, ones on Billy Bremner the footballer, Dolly the Sheep, the Scottish Parliament and the politician John Smith.\n\n"}

{"id": "16011340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16011340", "title": "Comparison of Asian national space programs", "text": "Comparison of Asian national space programs\n\nSeveral Asian countries have space programs and are actively competing to achieve scientific and technological advancements in space, a situation sometimes referred to as the Asian space race in the popular media as a reference to the earlier Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Like the previous space race, issues involved in the current push to space include national security, which has spurred many countries to send artificial satellites as well as humans into Earth orbit and beyond. A number of Asian countries are seen as contenders in the ongoing race to be the pre-eminent power in space.\n\nOf the ten countries that have independently successfully launched a satellite into orbit, six are Asian: China, India, Iran, Israel, Japan and North Korea.\n\nChina's first manned spacecraft entered orbit in October 2003, making China the first Asian nation to send a human into space.\n\nIndia is expected to demonstrate independent human spaceflight by 2020 and human landing on the moon by 2030, and Iran and Japan have plans for independent manned spaceflights around 2020. China is also still predicting manned mission to the Earth moon by 2025 and to Mars by 2050.\n\nWhile the achievements of space programs run by the main Asian space players (China, India, and Japan) pale in comparison to the milestones set by the former Soviet Union and the United States, some experts believe Asia may soon lead the world in space exploration. China has been the leader of Asia's space race since the beginning of the 21st century. The first Chinese manned spaceflight, in 2003, marked the beginning of a space race in the region. At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon back in the late 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.\nIn January 2007 China became the first Asian military-space power to send an anti-satellite missile into orbit, to destroy an aging Chinese Feng Yun 1C weather satellite in polar orbit. The resulting explosion sent a wave of debris hurtling through space at more than 6 miles per second. A month later, Japan's space agency launched an experimental communications satellite designed to enable super high-speed data transmission in remote areas.\n\nAfter successful achievement of geostationary technology, India's ISRO launched its first Moon mission, Chandrayaan-1 in October 2008, which discovered ice water on the Moon. India then launched on 5 November 2013 its maiden interplanetary mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission. The primary objective is to determine Mars' atmospheric composition and attempt to detect methane. The spacecraft completed its journey on 24 September 2014 when it entered its intended orbit around Mars, making India the first Asian country to successfully place a Mars orbiter and the only country in history to do so in the first attempt. ISRO became the fourth space agency in the world to send a spacecraft to Mars, only behind NASA, ROSMOS, and ESA.\n\nIn addition to increasing national pride, countries are commercially motivated to operate in space. Commercial satellites are launched for communications, weather forecasting, and atmospheric research. According to a report by the Space Frontier Foundation released in 2006, the \"space economy\" is estimated to be worth about $180 billion, with more than 60% of space-related economic activity coming from commercial goods and services. China and India propose the initiation of a commercial launch service.\n\nChina has a space program with an independent human spaceflight capability. It has developed a sizable family of successful Long March rockets. It has launched two lunar orbiters, Chang'e 1 and Chang'e 2. On 2 December 2013, China launched a modified Long March 3B rocket, with Chang'e 3 Moon lander and its rover Yutu on-board toward the Moon and successfully performed soft landing and rover operations, becoming the third country to do so. It also has plans to retrieve samples by late 2017. In 2011, China embarked on a program to establish a manned space station, starting with the launch of Tiangong 1 and followed by Tiangong 2 in 2016. China attempted to send a Mars orbiter (Yinghuo-1) in 2011 on a joint mission with Russia, which failed to leave Earth orbit. Nevertheless, the 2020 Chinese Mars Mission with an orbiter, a lander and a rover has been approved by the government and is aiming a launch date in the year 2020. China has collaborative projects with Russia, ESA, and Brazil, and has launched commercial satellites for other countries. Some analysts suggest that the Chinese space program is linked to the nation's efforts at developing advanced military technology.\n\nChina's advanced technology is the result of the integration of various related technological experiences. Early Chinese satellites, such as the FSW series, have undergone many atmospheric reentry tests. In the 1990s China had commercial launches, resulting in more launch experiences and a high success rate after the 1990s. China has aimed to undertake scientific development in fields like Solar System exploration. China's Shenzhou 7 spacecraft successfully performed an EVA in September 2008. China's Shenzhou 9 spacecraft successfully performed a manned docking in June 2012. Furthermore, China's Chang'e 2 explorer became the first object to reach Sun-Earth Lagrangian point in August 2011 and also the first probe to explore both Moon and asteroid by making a flyby of the asteroid 4179 Toutatis. China has launched DAMPE, the most capable dark matter explorer to date in 2015, and world's first quantum communication satellite QUESS in 2016.\n\nIndia's interest in space travel began in the early 1960s, when scientists launched a Nike-Apache rocket from TERLS, Kerala. Under Vikram Sarabhai, the program focused on the practical uses of space in increasing the standard of living. Remote sensing and communications satellites were placed into orbit.\n\nThe first Indian to travel in space was Rakesh Sharma, who flew aboard Soyuz T-11, launched April 2, 1984, from erstwhile USSR.\n\nJust a few days after China said that it would send a human into orbit in the second half of 2003, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee publicly urged his country's scientists to work towards sending a man to the Moon. It successfully sent its probe to the Moon in October 2008 and is planning its second Moon mission, Chandrayaan-2 for 2019.\n\nISRO launched its Mars Orbiter Mission on November 5, 2013 (informally called \"Mangalyaan\") which successfully entered into the orbit around Mars on 24 September 2014. India is the first in Asia and fourth in the world to perform a successful Mars mission. It is also the only one to do so on the first attempt and at a record low cost of $74 million.\n\nISRO has demonstrated its re-entry technology and till date has launched as many as 175 foreign satellites belonging to global customers from 20 countries including US, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, U.K. All of these have been launched successfully by PSLVs so far, gaining significant expertise in space technologies. In June 2016, India set a record by launching 20 satellites simultaneously. The PSLVs are also one of world's most reliable launch vehicles which clocked its 35th successful mission (39 total) in a row as of February 2017, thus having success rate of nearly 90%.\n\nIndia broke the world record by successfully placing 104 satellites (almost tripling the Russian record of 37) in Earth Orbit on 15 February 2017 on a single rocket launch (PSLV-C37).\n\nRecent reports indicate that human spaceflight is planned with a spacecraft called \"Gaganyaan\" for December 2021 on a home-grown GSLV-III rocket. ISRO is also planning to send orbiters to Venus, Mars and Jupiter or comets and asteroids in the near future.\n\nJapan has been cooperating with the United States on missile defence since 1999. North Korean nuclear and Chinese military programs represent a serious issue for Japan's foreign relations.\nJapan is working on military and civilian space technologies, developing missile defence systems, new generations of military spy satellites, and planning for manned stations on the Moon.\nJapan started to construct spy satellites after North Korea test fired a Taepodong missile over Japan in 1998. The North Korean government claimed the missile was merely launching a satellite to space, and accused Japan of causing an arms race. The Japanese constitution adopted after World War II limits military activities to defensive operations. On May 2007 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for a bold review of the Japanese Constitution to allow the country to take a larger role in global security and foster a revival of national pride. Japan has not yet developed its own manned spacecraft and does not have a program in place to develop one. The Japanese space shuttle HOPE-X, to be launched by the conventional space launcher H-II, was developed but the program was postponed and eventually cancelled. Then the simpler manned capsule Fuji was proposed but not adopted. Pioneer projects of single-stage to orbit, reusable launch vehicle horizontal takeoff and landing ASSTS and vertical takeoff and landing Kankoh-maru were developed but have not been adopted. A more conservative new (JAXA manned spacecraft) project is proposed to launch by 2025 as part of the Japanese plan to send manned missions to the Moon. is doubtful about the Japanese manned Moon project, and suspects the project is a euphemism for participation in the American Constellation program. JAXA planned to send a humanoid robot (such as ASIMO) to the Moon.\n\nIran has developed its own satellite launch vehicle, named the Safir SLV, based on the Shahab series of IRBMs. On 2 February 2009, Iranian state television reported that Iran's first domestically made satellite Omid (from the Persian امید, meaning \"Hope\") had been successfully launched into low Earth orbit by a version of Iran's Safir rocket, the Safir-2. The launch coincided with the 30th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution. Iran is also developing a new launch vehicle Simorgh (rocket).\n\nIsrael became the tenth country in the world to build its own satellite and launch it with its own launcher on 19 September 1988. Israel launched its first satellite, Ofeq-1, using an Israeli-built Shavit three-stage launch vehicle. The launching was the high point of a process that began in 1983 with the establishment of the Israel Space Agency under the aegis of the Ministry of Science. Space research by university-based scientists began in the 1960s, providing a ready-made pool of experts for Israel's foray into space. Since then, local universities, research institutes, and private industry, backed by the Israel Space Agency, have made progress in space technology. The agency's role is to support \"private and academic space projects, coordinate their efforts, initiate and develop international relations and projects, head integrative projects involving different bodies, and create public awareness for the importance of space development.\"\n\nNorth Korea has many years of experience with rocket technology, which it has passed along to Pakistan and other countries. On December 12, 2012, North Korea placed its first satellite in orbit with the launch of Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2. On 12 March 2009 North Korea signed the Outer Space Treaty and the Registration Convention, after a previous declaration of preparations for the launch of Kwangmyongsong-2. North Korea twice announced satellite launches: Kwangmyŏngsŏng-1 on 31 August 1998 and Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2 on 5 April 2009. Neither of these claims were confirmed by the rest of the world, but the United States and South Korea believe there were tests of military ballistic missiles. The North Korean space agency is the Korean Committee of Space Technology, which operates the Musudan-ri and Tongch'ang-dong Space Launch Center rocket launching sites and has developed the Baekdusan-1 and Unha (Baekdusan-2) space launchers and Kwangmyŏngsŏng satellites. In 2009 North Korea announced several future space projects, including manned space flights and the development of a manned partially reusable launch vehicle. The successor to the Korean Committee of Space Technology, National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA) successfully launched an Unha-3 launch vehicle in February of 2016, placing the Kwangmyŏngsŏng-4 satellite in orbit.\n\nSouth Korea is a newer player in the Asian space race. In August 2006 South Korea launched its first military communications satellite, the Mugunghwa-5. The satellite was placed in geosynchronous orbit and collects surveillance information about North Korea. The South Korean government is spending hundreds of millions of dollars in space technology and was due to launch its first space launcher, the Korea Space Launch Vehicle, in 2008. South Korea's government justifies the cost for reasons of long-term commercial benefits and national pride. South Korea has long seen North Korea's significantly longer missile range as a serious threat to its national security. With the nation's first astronaut launched into space, Lee So-yeon, South Korea gained confidence in entering the Asian space race. They have completed the construction of Naro Space Center. South Korea is now attempting to build satellites and rockets with local technology. South Korea is pursuing a space program that could defend the peninsula while lessening their dependency on the United States.\n\nPakistan started pursuing space technology on 16 September 1961, when Pakistan's space agency, SUPARCO was created, with renowned physicist Abdus Salam as its first administrator. In its early days, SUPARCO researched on the development of solid-fuel sounding rockets with assistance provided by the United States. On 7 June 1962, with the launch of the \"Rehbar-I\" (\"lit. Teller of the Way\") rocket, Pakistan became the tenth country in the world to successfully conduct the launch of an unmanned spacecraft. This rocket had been developed by a team of scientists and engineers of the Pakistan Air Force, led by Air Commodore (Brigadier-General) Władysław Józef Marian Turowicz in collaboration with NASA and was launched from Sonmiani, Pakistan's first space launch facility. SUPARCO's unmanned space program continued till 1972, with nearly 20 successful launches. SUPARCO's unmanned space program suffered setbacks during the 1970s and the 1980s, delaying the development and launch of Pakistan's first satellite, Badr-I till 1990 when it was launched from China. SUPARCO launched Pakistan's second satellite, Badr-B in 2001 from Baikonur Cosmodrome using a Ukrainian Zenit-2 rocket, followed by Paksat-1R in 2011 which was contracted and actually built and launched by China, was Pakistan's first communication satellite. On 9 July, 2018, Pakistan launched two satellites from China's Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre with Long March 2C Rocket. The Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-1) was a dual-purpose Earth observational and optical satellite. It was designed and developed by SUPARCO’s engineers. It was weight satellite which will operate at an altitude of . With the launching of PRSS-1 , Pakistan has become one of the few countries to have its own remote sensing satellite in the orbit. Another flagship satellite, Pakistan Technology Evaluation Satellite (PakTES-1A) which was also designed and developed by SUPARCO’s engineers, has also co-launched with PRSS-1 by the same launch rocket, Long March 2C. It was a weight satellite with an optical payload commensurate with national needs. It will operate at an altitude of .\n\nPakistan intends to send its first national in space onboard a Chinese spacecraft by 2022, as announced by information minister Chaudhry. \n\nWith the planned launched of Bangabandhu-1 satellite purchased abroad, Bangladesh will operate its first communication satellite. Bangladesh Space Agency intends to launch satellites after 2020. Bangladesh's government has stressed that the country seeks an \"entirely peaceful and commercial\" role in space.\n\nIndonesia operates their own communication satellites purchased abroad, and intends to develop and use their own small space launch vehicle Pengorbitan (RPS-420).\n\nOther space players are Malaysia and Turkey, that announced multi-task space programs in 2006 and 2007. They intend to develop their own satellites and launchers in the near future, and manned space facilities. As of 2012 Turkey was developing its own military satellite. The first Göktürk satellite is planned to be launched in 2013. The Turkish satellite is planned to be capable of taking satellite images of greater than two meters per pixel resolution, thus making Turkey the second nation in the world capable of such a feat, after the United States.\n\n\"Also see the section: Comparison of key technologies\"\n\n\nRecords of each country are listed by chronological order unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n? : Date is assumed\n\"Only projects with under-development or above status have been listed\"\n\nSolar System exploration and manned spaceflights are major space technologies in the public eye. Since Sakigake, the first interplanetary probe in Asia, was launched in 1985, Japan has completed the most planetary exploration, but other nations are catching up.\n\nThe Moon is thought to be rich in Helium-3, which could one day be used in nuclear fusion power plants to fuel future energy demands in Asia. All three main Asian space powers plan to send men to the Moon in the distant future and have already sent lunar probes.\n\nJapan was the first Asian country to launch a lunar probe. The Hiten (Japanese: \"flying angel\") spacecraft (known before the launch as MUSES-A), built by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science of Japan, was launched on 24 January 1990. In many ways, the mission did not go as was planned. Kaguya, the second Japanese lunar orbiter spacecraft, was launched on 14 September 2007.\n\nChina launched its first lunar probe, Chang'e-1, on 24 October 2007 and successfully entered lunar orbit on 5 November 2007.\n\nIndia launched its first lunar probe, Chandrayaan-1, on 22 October 2008 and successfully entered its final lunar orbit on 2 November 2008. The mission was considered a major success and the probe detected water on the lunar surface.\n\nThe first confirmed Moon landing from Asia was Hiten's mission in 1993. An intentional hard landing at the end of the mission, some pictures of the lunar surface were taken before impact. Hiten was not designed as a Moon lander and had few scientific instruments for lunar exploration. The next Japanese Moon landing program was the LUNAR-A, developed from 1992. Although the LUNAR-A orbiter was cancelled, its penetrators are integrated into the Russian Luna-Glob program, which was scheduled to launch in 2011. The penetrators are \"relatively\" hard landers, but they are not expected to be destroyed at impact.\n\nThe first Asian probe that was part of a lunar landing program was the Indian Moon Impact Probe (MIP) released from Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. MIP was a hard lander and was designed to move the ground under for research purposes. MIP was designed to be destroyed at impact. Its instruments performed lunar observations to within 25 minutes before impact. The landing test will be applied to future soft landings such as Chandrayaan-2, planned for 2016.\n\nThe Chinese Chang'e-1 spacecraft also achieved a systematic hard landing at the end of its mission in 2009, when China became the sixth country to reach the lunar surface. One purpose of the lander was to pre-test for future soft landings. A Chinese lunar soft lander is achieved with the Chang'e-3 mission.\n\nJapanese interplanetary probes have been mostly limited to Small Solar System bodies such as comets and asteroids. JAXA's Nozomi probe was launched in 1998, but contact was lost with the probe due to electrical failures before visiting the planet Mars. The second Japanese probe for the planet Venus, Akatsuki, was launched in 2010. Akatsuki entered orbit around Venus on December 7, 2015.\n\nChinese scientists expect that China will take 20 years to launch independent planetary probes. The Chinese manned Mars exploration program is planned for around 2050 by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nIndia has successfully launched Mars Orbiter Mission on November 5, 2013. It reached Mars on September 2014. India has become the only country to successfully insert a satellite into Martian orbit in its maiden attempt; it also became the first Asian country to achieve this feat.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24461343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24461343", "title": "Comparison of Canadian football and rugby union", "text": "Comparison of Canadian football and rugby union\n\nA comparison of Canadian football and rugby union is possible because of the games' shared origins, despite their dissimilarities.\n\nThe most significant difference in play is the allowance of blocking for the ball carrier, which is to say preventing a defender from tackling the player with the ball. This rule in Canadian football allows top-flight teams to include hundreds of different plays in each and every match. It also slows the game down, causing frequent stoppages and less spontaneity in play. The laws against this in rugby union allow for each team to contest possession at all stages of a game. This determines the fluid and rapid nature of rugby where possession of the ball may change back and forth between teams without a break in play for long periods. This means that although rugby teams practice and execute a large number of pre-rehearsed plays the players at the top level especially must be quick thinking and tactically adept to cope with an unpredictable, fast moving game.\n\nProfessional and most scholastic Canadian football team play has evolved from a single team with all players except limited substitutions playing the entire game, to a specialized \"platoon\" system consisting of three separate units (offensive, defensive, and \"special teams\" used for kicking and punting) with only one of the three being on the field at a time. That is to say that in Professional Canadian football, the majority of players only play in one specialization (or \"one side of the ball\") -- however, every player is eligible to play in any specialization. In rugby the teams are divided into eight forwards and seven backs. Both groups of players partake on attacking and defensive plays and are on the pitch at the same time. The eight forwards however only take part in the \"set pieces\" which are ways to contest ball possession when there is a minor rule infringement or the ball passes out of bounds. These are the scrums, a test of strength, and the line outs. A persons build and skill level determines which group they can play in. All forwards must be heavy and strong to scrummage well but not so heavy that they are too slow to partake in attacking plays. The backs are lighter and faster and include the expert kickers. The forwards numbered 6 through 8 are the players that need to have good all round rugby skills as well as speed and strength. In professional rugby there are very few players who can play equally well in a variety of positions and most will play in the same position from youth. Every position in rugby has its own unique name (except for number 8) and associated skill base.\n\nIn the majority of club and schoolhouse Canadian Football the majority of players play both offence and defence only being substituted for injury. Substitutes in Canadian football can return to the game at any stoppage in play. In rugby union, any player substituted off for any reason except for minor bleeding is not allowed to return to the game (with the possible exception of front-row forwards). Rugby teams may make up to eight substitutions. There are fifteen players on the pitch at all times. Players who are verified as bleeding by an independent medical official are sent to the \"blood bin,\" where they can receive medical treatment, and replaced until they have stopped bleeding. Ejected players in Canadian football can be replaced with a substitute, while in rugby union ejection means the team must play a man down the remainder of the game. This is known as being \"red carded\" and is punishment for especially dangerous play. Players who are red carded typically are banned for a number of games or even permanently.\n\nA rugby union game is divided into two halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower grade games) separated by a 10-minute half time period. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball is kicked into touch, a team scores, or the losing side commits a penalty. Time may also be added onto each half at the referee's discretion to make up for time lost due to treatment of injuries, etc. (this usually amounts to less than 5 minutes). Most commonly, however, the clock will be stopped by the referee to allow for treatment of injured players during the game, removing the need for added injury time. In contrast Canadian football matches are made up of four quarters of 15 minutes each, but the clock stops and starts according to specific rules, so that the 15 minutes quarter lasts slightly longer. In the professional (televised) version of this sport the game is often paused for the airing of commercials and advertisements; this does not occur outside of the televised environment where breaks in play are comparable to those in rugby union. In addition to this, the half time break is typically 12- to 15-minutes; this intermission allows for resetting of strategy in both rugby and Canadian football and adjusting to the opponents schemes. During the period entertainment is played for the crowd, ranging from marching band performances in high school and college games to big-name entertainment (e.g. Black Eyed Peas and The Tragically Hip) for the Grey Cup. The entertainment in rugby varies from club to club but traditionally would involve a band performance. The typical game in a non-televised environment lasts for around 120 minutes.\n\nRugby union matches are timed for 80 minutes, in two 40-minute halves. Canadian football games are timed for two 30-minute halves, each of which is further divided into 15-minute quarters.\n\nIn both sports, the primary objective of the game is to carry the ball over the opponents goal line. In both sports the ball may be passed backwards an unlimited number of times, but in Canadian football the ball may be passed forward and sideways as long as the passer is behind the line of scrimmage, as opposed to rugby union where the ball cannot be passed but only kicked forward. The secondary scoring objective is to kick the ball through the opponents goalposts and over its crossbar.\n\nIn Canadian football, \"play\" is stopped when a player is ruled down or out of bounds, whereas the play in rugby union continues until a player or the ball goes out of bounds, a player/team commits a foul or a player scores.\n\nThe forward pass and the stoppage when a player is grounded results in short plays and a generally staccato game play in Canadian football, as opposed to the longer and more fluid passages of play found in rugby union. If a player in rugby is tackled then the ball must be released and any player arriving at the scene may pick up the ball and run with it. If two or more opposing players arrive at the same time then a ruck is formed and the players push each other to get at the ball before play continues. Rugby therefore involves far more running and less scrimmaging than Canadian football.\n\nIn rugby, kicking during the flow of the game is done for tactical reasons (both offensive and defensive) or to score a goal. If the ball is recovered by the kicking team, it can lead to significant improvement in field position. It is also legal in rugby to kick a goal at any point in the game. This is called a drop goal. In Canadian football, a team that kicks the ball during play automatically gives up possession and cannot recover the ball unless an error in catching the ball (known as a \"fumble\") is made by the receiving team; because of this, punting is typically done only when teams do not expect to be able to retain possession (i.e. on third down). Additionally, rule changes made in the early 20th century mandated that field goals cannot be made in front of the line of scrimmage; this has led to the near demise of the drop-kick field goal in Canadian football (unless the drop-kick is executed behind the line of scrimmage, which is rarely done). Catching and blocking kicked balls is an integral part of rugby skills.\n\nIn Canadian football, each team is allowed to stop the game clock one time per half (referred to as \"timeouts\"), and the officials will also stop the clock when there are three minutes to play in each half (referred to as the \"Three minute warning\"). There are no such stoppages in rugby. The game clock in Canadian football is also stopped at various times depending on how the previous play ended; for example if the ball carrier runs out of bounds, or if a forward pass is incomplete.\n\nVarious forms of football have been played in Britain for centuries with different villages and schools having their own traditional rules. Rugby-like games were first introduced into Canada by British soldiers and colonists in the mid-1800s. However at that time a standard set of rules did not exist and teams would negotiate the rules before playing a game.\n\nThe Football Association was formed in England in October 1863. Differences of opinion about the proposed laws led to the formation of the first governing body for rugby in 1871 the Rugby Football Union. Laws were drawn up for rugby football which was now distinct from Association football (soccer).\n\nRugby football proper in Canada dates back to the 1860s. Introduction of the game and its early growth is usually credited to settlers from Britain and the British army and navy in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Esquimalt, British Columbia.\n\nIn 1864 the first recorded game of rugby in Canada took place in Montreal amongst artillery men. It is most likely that rugby got its start in British Columbia in the late 1860s or early 1870s when brief mentions of \"football\" appeared in print.\n\nF. Barlow Cumberland and Fred A. Bethune first codified rules for rugby football in Canada, in 1865 at Trinity College, Toronto, and the first proper Canadian game of rugby took place in 1865 when officers of an English regiment played local civilians, mainly from McGill University.\n\nRugby is also an ancestor of Canadian football, currently its main competitor. A \"running game\", resembling rugby, was taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868.\n\nBack in England, a schism developed between those who favoured strict amateurism and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby. In 1895, this resulted in the formation of a break-away governing body, the Northern Union.\n\nThe Northern Union began to make changes to the laws of rugby in 1906, which resulted in the sport of rugby league. The Rugby Football Union's version of rugby became as known as rugby union after its governing body.\n\nAlthough both codes are played on similar sized rectangular fields, the dimensions of rugby union fields can vary up to maximum size that is larger than the fixed size of Canadian football fields. Rugby union fields are limited to a maximum length of 144 m long (and 100 m between goal lines) and width of 70 m, while Canadian football fields have a fixed length of 150 yd (137 m) long and width of 160 ft (48.8 m). Both sets of measurements include scoring zones at each end. These are fixed to 20 yd and called the end zone in Canadian football, but of unspecified length in rugby union.\n\nThe Canadian football field is long and wide with end zones deep. At each goal line is a set of goalposts, which consist of two \"uprights\" joined by a crossbar which is above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts above the ground) is preferred.\n\nThe border between the regular field of play and a scoring zone is called the \"goal line\" in Canadian football and the \"try line\" in rugby union. The outer perimeters of both fields are demarcated with sidelines (ends of rugby union field border the scoring zone being called \"dead ball lines\" and longitudinal sides \"touch lines\"). The central playing field of rugby is divided into halves by a \"halfway line\"; however, when the Canadian football field was marked, the centre line was marked as 55yards or C which stands for centre.\n\nAdditional lines differ markedly with Canadian football fields marked at every 5 yard interval, whereas rugby union fields only have two further solid lines called the \"22 metre lines\" and four broken lines each halving a half (resulting in four quarters and being translated as \"quarter lines\" in some languages). The dotted lines are made of two \"10 metre lines\" on each side of the halfway line and two \"5 metre lines\" before each goal line. Rugby union fields also have another set of dotted \"5 metre lines\".\n\nThe yard lines in Canadian football are vitally important during game play, because a team's advance is measured against these lines, which in turn determines ball possession, whereas the halfway, \"22\" and \"10 yards lines\" only determine the position of players during various rugby union kick-offs (which could be from the halfway line or \"22s\") or line-out in the case of the broken line 5 yd from the side lines.\n\nBoth codes also have goalposts at each end of the field: on the goal line in the case of rugby union, same as in Canadian football. Canadian football goalposts consist of two vertical posts 18.5 feet apart (24 feet in high school football) rising from a horizontal crossbar mounted on single (usually) post raising it 10 ft off the ground (resulting in a combined Y-shape of sorts). Rugby union goalposts are 5.6 m (18.3 ft) apart and extend vertically from the ground being connected by a crossbar at 3 m (9.8 ft), creating an H-shape. In both cases, only kicks passing between the uprights and above the crossbar score points. The scoring areas of both types of goalposts are therefore similar.\n\nIn Canadian football, the team that is in possession of the ball, the offence, has three downs to advance the ball 10 yards towards the opponent's end zone. If the offence gains 10 yards, it gets another set of three downs. If the offence fails to gain 10 yards after 3 downs, it loses possession of the ball.\n\nThe ball is put into play by a snap. All players line up facing each other at the line of scrimmage. One offensive player, the centre, then passes (or \"snaps\") the ball between his legs to a teammate, usually the quarterback.\n\nPlayers can then advance the ball in two ways:\n\nA down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:\n\nRugby union is based on the 'right to contest possession'. A team is not required to surrender possession when the ball carrier is tackled, in contrast to Canadian football, where a team must surrender their possession when a player is tackled and no downs remain. Rugby union players must win possession in open play, unless the team in possession makes an infringement, scores, or the ball leaves the field of play.\n\nA team in rugby union can advance the ball in two ways:\n\n\nIn rugby the method of attack is typically decided by the person in the number ten jersey (the flyhalf). Once the forwards gain possession of the ball after a scrum, line out or ruck the ball is usually passed to this player who is the midpoint between the forwards and the backs. He/she must read the oppositions defensive strategy and calls a play accordingly either running, passing or kicking to other players. After the set piece or ruck the no.10 is the first player who has time to control the play and must therefore be an expert at a wide variety of kicks and an expert passer. The rule differences mean that there are a wider variety of kicks and kicking strategies in rugby compared to Canadian football.\n\nPossession may change in different ways in both games:\n\n\nIn both codes, tactical kicking is an important aspect of play. In Canadian football, it is normal to punt on the last down, but, as in rugby union, a kick can take place at any phase of play.\n\nIn Canadian football, the offence can throw the ball forward once on a play from behind the line of scrimmage. The forward pass is a distinguishing feature of Canadian football as it is strictly forbidden in rugby.\n\nThe ball can be thrown sideways or backwards without restriction in both games. In Canadian football this is known as a lateral and is much less common than in rugby union.\n\nIn both codes, if the ball is caught by an opposition player this results in an interception and possession changes hands.\n\nIn both games it is permitted to bring down the player in possession of the ball and prevent them making forward progress. In rugby, unlike in Canadian football, the ball is still in play. Players from either team can take possession of the ball. The tackled player must present the ball (release the ball) so that open play can continue.\n\nRugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The arms of the attacker must also wrap around the player being tackled. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not \"ram\" into the formation without first binding to the players.\n\nIn Canadian football, tacklers are not required to wrap their arms around the ball carrier before bringing him to the ground; in fact, the ball carrier is often \"tackled\" by the defender taking a running start and hitting the ball carrier to knock them to the ground. Tackles can also be made by grabbing the ball carrier's jersey and pulling him to the ground (though pulling down a ball carrier by the pads behind his neck is known as a \"horse collar\", a move now illegal at all levels of the Canadian game). If a ball carrier is stopped for more than a few seconds, the referee can blow the whistle, declare the player's forward progress stopped, and end the play even though the ball carrier is not actually tackled to the ground.\n\nIn Canadian football, players are allowed to 'block' players without the ball, this is not permitted in rugby union and would be considered 'obstruction', resulting in a penalty.\n\nA touchdown is the Canadian equivalent of a try. Unlike Canadian football, both codes of rugby require the ball to be grounded, whereas in Canadian football it is sufficient for the ball to enter the end zone (in-goal area) when in the possession of a player (making the term \"touchdown\" a misnomer). In Canadian football a touchdown scores 6 points; in rugby union a try is worth 5 points.\n\nIn both games, following a try / touchdown, there is the opportunity to score additional points by kicking the ball between the posts and over the bar. In Canadian football this is called an extra point (worth 1 point); in rugby union it is known as a conversion (worth 2 points). (The result is that both the touchdown/extra point combination and the try/conversion combination, when successful, total to 7 points.) One key difference between an extra point and a conversion is that a conversion kick must be taken from a position in line with where the try was scored, although the distance from the try line from which the conversion kick is taken is not fixed. Hence, it is advantageous to ground the ball under the posts rather than in the corner which makes for a more difficult kick. Also, Canadian football features the option of the going for a 2-point convert, where the attacking team gets one chance from 5 yards out to get the ball in the endzone again. This would be worth 2 points on top of the 6 already awarded for the touchdown.\n\nIn Canadian football teams often opt to go for a field goal (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown. The rugby equivalent is a drop goal (worth 3 points in union and only one in league). The key difference between a field goal and a drop goal is that a field goal attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby the ball must hit the ground and be kicked from a half-volley.\n\nA similar concept in rugby is the penalty goal. Following the award of the penalty, the attacking team may opt to kick for goal rather than advance the ball by hand or punting. This scores 3 points. The penalty goal is similar to a field goal in Canadian football in that the ball is kicked from the ground, but it cannot be charged. There is no direct equivalent to a penalty goal in Canadian football. A rare play called a \"fair catch kick\" is analogous to a goal from mark which existed in rugby union at one time.\n\nCanadian football has one further method of scoring which does not exist in rugby. If the team with possession causes the ball to enter their own endzone, and the ball carrier is then tackled while within the endzone, then this results in a safety which scores 2 points for the attacking team and results in the defending team having to kick the ball to the team who recorded it. In rugby union this does not score any points but results in a scrum 5 meters from the try zone with the tackling team in possession.\n\nIn Rugby, If the ball is kicked past the try line and the receiving team grounds it without returning to the field of play, a drop kick from the 22-metre line ensues. In Canadian football, if a kick-off or punt goes into the endzone and the receiving team downs it without leaving the endzone, the result is a \"rouge\" and the receiving team gains possession of the ball but give up a point to the punting team for failing to advance the ball out of the endzone.\n\nAn important difference between the two sports involves the aftermath of a score. In Canadian football, the scoring team kicks off, except after a safety. In rugby union, the team scored upon kicks off (in rugby sevens, a variant of rugby union featuring seven players per side, the scoring team kicks off).\n\nCanadian teams have twelve players on the field per side. Different players may be interchanged at will for offence and defence as well as special teams for specific activities.\n\nA Canadian football team consists of an offensive unit, a defensive unit and a \"special teams\" unit (involved in kicking and kick returns). Twelve players can be on the field at any time. Players are allowed to play on more than one of the units, this is the norm for all but the highest levels of play (professional and large schools). The kicking unit, with the exception of a few specialists, is usually made up of reserve players from the offence and defence.\n\nIn both kinds of rugby the same players have to both defend and attack. There are fifteen players in a rugby union team (except in sevens and tens).\n\nMany of the positions in each code have similar names, but, in practice, the roles of those positions can be different. A fullback in Canadian football is very different from a fullback in rugby. Some of the positions are fairly similar; a Rugby fly-half carries out a similar role to a quarterback in Canadian football; however, quarterbacks touch the ball on almost every offensive play.\n\nBroadly speaking linemen and linebackers in Canadian football correspond to forwards in rugby, and running backs, receivers, and quarterbacks have roles similar to backs in rugby.\n\nBecause of the playing time, number of pauses, number of players and the nature of the game in general, rugby players will typically need higher physical endurance than Canadian football players while more short-term bursts of physical strength, power, and speed are required in Canadian football (amongst equivalent positions and weights). Collisions between players in rugby union tend to last significantly longer than Canadian football, in which collisions are more often \"hits\" in which the momentum of the player is enough to bring the other player to ground or at least forcing an error or fumble. In rugby union tackles must at least show an attempt to bind the opposing player. These hits are not usually at the speed of Canadian football both because of the nature of the game and the lack of protective equipment. Additionally, rugby offsides rules and the lack of a forward pass significantly reduce the chance of a player receiving a \"blind-side\" hit (i.e. being hit and/or tackled from behind). In Canadian football, players receiving a forward pass are often vulnerable because they must concentrate on catching the ball, often jumping very high or stretching out and thereby exposing their body to punishing hits; in rugby a player is not allowed to be tackled in the air, leaving the receiver of the kick with more time to assess his surroundings. Ball carriers in rugby can usually anticipate a hit and can brace themselves accordingly.\n\nIn rugby, the contact times between players are usually longer, as a more wrestling approach is required to bring players down, as momentum cannot always be relied upon particularly when the lines between the teams are consistently close, not allowing for significant momentum to be developed before meeting a defender. In rugby, rucks and mauls may develop following a tackle when multiple players from each team bind together to move the ball in play (on the ground or in-hand respectively). In Canadian football, equivalents to rucks and mauls are virtually non existent, as play stops when the ball carrier is stopped. This difference can be summed up in the idea that in Canadian football the objective is to bring the player to ground or to disrupt a pass to end the play, whereas in rugby the main objective is to stop the player from breaking the try line.\n\nCanadian football quarterbacks - and increasingly, their coaches - have several seconds to decide what the next play they will run in many occasions during the game, thus allowing for both complex tactics displayed within individual plays and overall game-wide strategy in play calling and play selection. In rugby union, the continuous nature of the game implies that there is no time to discuss team strategy, therefore offensive actions may seem to lack a definite direction for some periods of time. Rugby is more movement based than Canadian football in which short bursts are needed.\n\nRugby players often continue to participate in the game long after they have left school. In Canada, amateurs who have left school rarely play full tackle football, but often play touch football or flag football.\n\nRugby union players are allowed to wear modest padding on the head, shoulders and collarbone, but it must be sufficiently light, thin and compressible to meet IRB standards. The headguard, also called a \"scrum cap\", is now commonly worn throughout all levels of the game. Protective headgear which is becoming essential because of the quantity of cuts and head injuries that can occur, particularly by the boots of players involved in rucking. Hard plastic or metal are prohibited in rugby kit. This includes hard plastic shin guards. No form of metal is allowed in any rugby kit, except for IRB-approved soft aluminum studs on boots. An essential part of the safety equipment needed for rugby is the gumshield or mouthguard. Players also have the option to use fingerless gloves which have been introduced recently to the game allowing players to better grip the ball.\n\nCanadian football players wear much bulkier protective equipment, such as a padded plastic helmet, shoulder pads, hip pads and knee pads. These protective pads were introduced decades ago and have improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players. A Canadian football helmet consists of a hard plastic top with thick padding on the inside, a facemask made of one or more metal bars, and a chinstrap used to secure the helmet. An unintended consequence of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of violence in the game which unprotected would be extremely dangerous. In previous years with less padding, tackling more closely resembled tackles in rugby union, with less severe impacts and less severe structural injuries.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1221228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1221228", "title": "Firman", "text": "Firman\n\nA firman ( \"farmân\"), or ferman (Turkish), at the constitutional level, was a royal mandate or decree issued by a sovereign in an Islamic state, namely the Ottoman Empire. During various periods they were collected and applied as traditional bodies of law. The word firman comes from Persian meaning \"decree\" or \"order\".\n\nOn a more practical level, a firman was, and may still be, any written permission granted by the appropriate Islamic official at any level of government. Westerners are perhaps most familiar with the permission to travel in a country, which typically could be purchased beforehand, or the permission to conduct scholarly investigation in the country, such as archaeological excavation. Firmans may or may not be combined with various sorts of passports.\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire, the Sultan derived his authority from his role as upholder of the Shar'ia, but the Shar'ia did not cover all aspects of Ottoman social and political life. Therefore, in order to regulate relations and status, duties and dress of aristocracy and subjects, the Sultan created firmans.\n\nFirmans were gathered in codes called \"kanun\" (from the Hellenic word \"kanon\" (κανών) meaning \"rule\" or \"rules\", as well as the Arabic word \"qanun\" () also meaning \"rule\" or \"law\"). The \"kanun\" were \"a form of secular and administrative law considered to be a valid extension of religious law as a result of the ruler's right to exercise legal judgement on behalf of the community.\"\n\nWhen issued by the sultan in the Ottoman Empire, firmans' importance was often displayed by the layout of the document; the more blank space at the top of the document, the more important the firman was.\n\nIn this firman, Sultan Murad I recognises a decree created by his father Sultan Orhan (ca. 1324-60). He gives the monks all they owned during his father's reign, ordering that no one can oppress them or claim their land.\n\nIn this firman, the monks of Mount Athos report that the administrative officials charged with the collection of taxes come at a later date than they are supposed to and demand more money than the value assessed. They also make illegal demands for additional food supplies.\n\nOne of the most important firmans governing relations between Muslims and Christians is a document kept at the Saint Catherine's Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. This monastery is Greek Orthodox and constitutes the autonomous Sinai Orthodox Church. The firman bears the hand print of Muhammad, and requests the Muslims do not destroy the monastery for God-fearing men live there. To this day there is a protected zone around the monastery administered by the Egyptian government, and there are very good relations between the 20 or so monks, mainly from Greece, and the local community there.\n\nFirmans were issued in some Islamic empires and kingdoms in India such as the Mughal Empire and the State of Hyderabad.\n\nThe term \"firman\" was used by the archeologist/novelist Elizabeth Peters for official permission from the Egyptian Department of Antiquities to carry on an excavation. A similar authority was cited by Austen Henry Layard for excavations at Nimrud which he mistakenly believed was Nineveh.\n\n"}

It was built at the request of King Louis XIV of France (r. 1643–1715), as a retreat for himself and his maîtresse en titre of the time, the Marquise de Montespan (1640–1707), and as a place where he and invited guests could take light meals (\"collations\") away from the strict \"étiquette\" of the Court. \n\nThe Grand Trianon is set within its own park, which includes the Petit Trianon (the much smaller château built between 1762 and 1768 during the reign of Louis XV).\n\nIn 1663 and 1665, Louis XIV purchased Trianon, a hamlet on the outskirts of Versailles, and commissioned the architect Louis Le Vau to design a porcelain pavilion (\"Trianon de porcelaine\") to be built there. \nThe façade was made of white and blue Delft-style \"porcelain\" (ceramic) tiles from the French manufactures of Rouen, Lisieux, Nevers and Saint-Cloud. Construction began in 1670 and was finished in 1672. Because it was made in porcelain, the building suffers from deterioration. Louis XIV orders its demolition in 1686 and replaced it by a larger residence.\n\nBy 1687, the fragile ceramic tiles had deteriorated to such a point that Louis XIV ordered the demolition of the pavilion and its replacement with one made of stronger material. Commission of the work was entrusted to the architect Jules Hardouin Mansart. Hardouin-Mansart's new structure was twice the size of the porcelain pavilion and the material used was red marble of Languedoc. \n\nBegun in June 1687, the new construction (as we see it today) was finished in January 1688 and inaugurated by Louis XIV and his secret wife, the marquise de Maintenon, during the summer of 1688. \n\nThe \"Grand Trianon\" would often play host to the King and his wife. The first set of \"Grands apartments\" lasted from 1688 to 1691. The next was from 1691 till 1701; then 1701 till his death at Versailles in 1715.\n\nFrom 1703 to 1711, the building was the residence of \"le Grand Dauphin\". \n\nIn 1708, the prototypes for the Mazarin Commode, then called bureaux, were delivered to the Grand Trianon by André-Charles Boulle. The 1st Duke of Antin, Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin Director of the King's buildings, wrote to Louis XIV: \"\"I was at the Trianon inspecting the second writing desk by Boulle; it is as beautiful as the other and suits the room perfectly.\"\nThe domain was a favourite of the Duchess of Burgundy, the wife of his grandson Louis de France, the parents of Louis XV.\nIn the later years of Louis XIV's reign, the Trianon was the residence of the King's sister-in-law Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, Dowager Duchess of Orléans and known at court as \"Madame\". Her son, Philippe d'Orléans, future son-in-law of Louis XIV and Regent of France, lived there with his mother. Louis XIV even ordered the construction of a larger wing to the \"Grand Trianon\" which had begun in 1708 by Mansart; this wing, called \"Trianon-sous-Bois\", housed the Orléans family, including Louis XIV's legitimised daughter Françoise-Marie de Bourbon. \n\nThe King's youngest grandson Charles de France and his wife Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans also resided there. The Orléans family, who had apartments at the Palace of Versailles, were later replaced by Françoise-Marie's sister; the Duchess of Bourbon, \"Madame la Duchesse\" lived at the Trianon and later built the Palais Bourbon in Paris, the design of the palace being copied on that of the Trianon. \n\nIn 1717, Peter the Great of Russia, who was studying the palace and gardens of Versailles, resided at the \"Grand Trianon\"; the Grand Palace at Peterhof was inspired by Versailles.\n\nLouis XV did not bring any changes to the Grand Trianon. In 1740 and 1743, his father-in-law, Stanislas Leszczynski, former king of Poland stayed there during his visits to Versailles. Later, it was during a stay at Trianon that Louis XV fell ill before being transported to the Palace of Versailles, where he died on 10 May 1774.\n\nNo more than his predecessor had, Louis XVI brought no structural modifications to the \"Grand Trianon\". His wife, Queen Marie Antoinette, who preferred the Petit Trianon, gave a few theatrical representations in the \"galerie des Cotelle\", a gallery with paintings by Jean l'Aîné Cotelle representing the bosquets of Versailles and Trianon. \n\nDuring the French Revolution of 1789, the \"Grand Trianon\" was left to neglect. At the time of the First French Empire, Napoleon made it one of his residences, and furnished it in the Empire Style. \n\nNapoleon lived at Trianon with his second wife Marie Louise of Austria. \n\nThe next royals to live at Trianon were the King and Queen of the French, Louis Philippe I and his Italian wife Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies; he was a descendant of the Regent Philippe d'Orléans and she was a niece of Marie Antoinette. \n\nIn October 1837 Marie d'Orléans (daughter of Louis Philippe I) married Alexander of Württemberg at Trianon\n\nIn 1920, the \"Grand Trianon\" hosted the negotiations and signing of the Treaty of Trianon, which left Hungary with less than one-third of its pre-World War I land size. To Hungarians, the word \"Trianon\" remains to this day the symbol of one of their worst national disasters.\n\nIn 1963 Charles de Gaulle ordered a renovation of the building. \n\nA popular site for tourists visiting Versailles, it is one of the French Republic Presidential residences used to host foreign officials.\n\n\nIt is a official residence of the President of France, used for receiving foreign dignitaries.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37117402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37117402", "title": "Leiden Glossary", "text": "Leiden Glossary\n\nThe Leiden Glossary is a glossary contained in a manuscript in Leiden University Library, Voss. Lat. Q. 69. The lemmata (headwords) come from \"a range of biblical, grammatical, and patristic texts\". It is based on an Anglo-Saxon exemplar, and was prepared c. 800 in the Abbey of Saint Gall in modern-day Switzerland.\n\nThe glossary contains 48 chapters or \"glossae collectae\", which explain terms from texts used in the classroom by Theodore of Tarsus and Adrian of Canterbury, who both taught at St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, and thus \"contain the record of their classroom teaching\". Most of the glosses are in Latin, though 250 of them are in Old English. They give evidence of the impressive holdings of the Canterbury library (none of which remains) and the reading interests of Anglo-Saxon churchmen.\n\nOf the 48 \"glossae collectae\", 19 are on lemmata from Bible books, the 23 others from late antique and patristic texts. The importance of a glossary lies partly in that they indicate what was held in the library where the glossary is prepared, partly in what they suggest the glossator's interests were. For instance, Theodore's interest in the works of Pope Gregory I is clear from the distribution of the glosses: there are eight glosses on Gregory's \"Pastoral Care\" and no fewer than 46 (or 49) from his \"Dialogi\". In turn, the numerous glosses from the \"Dialogi\", much of which is concerned with hagiographical accounts, prove the importance attached by the Canterbury school to hagiography.\n\nA particular group concerns glosses on Rufinus's translation of Eusebius's \"Historia Ecclesiastica\", where the glossary preserves three groups of lemmata glossed by three different people, \"as if they represented the individual responses of three students, of somewhat differing abilities, to the teacher's explanation of the text.\"\n\nThat the St Gall copy derives from an exemplar brought to the continent from England is proven by the Anglo-Saxon glosses as well as by other content: the glosses are consistent with other biblical commentary produced by the Canterbury school. In addition, the Rufinus glosses agree with those found in the so-called P manuscript of Eusebius (BAV, Pal. lat. 822), written in Lorsch Abbey (in modern-day Germany) c. 800. The third Rufinus glossator evidently had an interest in Greek not shared by the other two, and Michael Lapidge finds that one lemma and its gloss are echoed in Aldhelm's \"De virginitate\"; Lapidge proposed that the third Rufinus glossator may well have been Aldhelm. The Lorsch manuscript, Lapidge argues, is most likely a copy of the manuscript used and annotated in the Canterbury school, the exemplar also for Leiden Voss. Lat. Q. 69.\n\nAn edition of the glosses was published in 1901 by Plazidus Glogger, with commentary published in 1903, and in 1906 Jan Hendrik Hessels published another. In the small world of philology, such an almost simultaneous publication is rare. In a note to his own edition, Hessels explains that he became aware of Glogger's edition as he was finishing up his own work, and then only by chance (he saw a note in the MS listing which scholars had worked on it); Glogger had sent Hessels a copy of his book in 1902 but it was delivered at the wrong college and never forwarded. In his note, Hessels says that Glogger had offered to destroy his own publication, which Hessels argued against, and in turn explains that he cannot, given the circumstances, criticize Glogger's work which at any rate was helpful to him and of the highest quality.\n\n"}

It aimed to provide a strategy for al-Qaeda and other extremists whereby they could create a new Islamic caliphate.\n\nThe real identity of Abu Bakr Naji is claimed by the Al Arabiya Institute for Studies to be Muhammad Khalil al-Hakaymah. His known works are this piece and some contributions to the al-Qaeda online magazine \"Sawt al-Jihad\". National Public Radio has described Naji as a \"top al-Qaida insider\" and characterized the work as \"al-Qaida's playbook\".\n\n\"Management of Savagery\" discusses the need to create and manage nationalist and religious resentment and violence in order to create long-term propaganda opportunities for jihadist groups. Notably, Naji discusses the value of provoking military responses from superpowers in order to recruit and train guerilla fighters and to create martyrs. Naji suggests that a long-lasting strategy of attrition will reveal fundamental weaknesses in the ability of superpowers to defeat committed jihadists.\n\n\"Management of Savagery\" argues that carrying out a campaign of constant violent attacks (vexation operations) in Muslim states will eventually exhaust their ability and will to enforce their authority, and that as the writ of the state withers away, chaos—or \"savagery\"—will ensue. Extreme violence is emphasized.\nOne who previously engaged in jihad knows that it is naught but violence, crudeness, terrorism, frightening [others] and massacring -- I am talking about jihad and fighting, not about Islam and one should not confuse them.\n\nJihadists can take advantage of this savagery to win popular support, or at least acquiescence, by implementing security, providing social services, and imposing Sharia. As these territories increase, they can become the nucleus of a new caliphate. Naji nominated Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, North Africa, Nigeria and Pakistan as potential targets, due to their geography, weak military presence in remote areas, existing jihadist presence, and easy accessibility of weapons.\nNaji professes to have been inspired by Ibn Taymiyya, the influential 14th-century Islamic scholar and theologian.\n\nThe word in the title توحش \"tawaḥḥuš\" has been translated as \"savagery\" or \"barbarism\". As it is a form V verbal noun derived from the root وحش \"waḥš\" \"wild animal\", it has also accordingly been translated \"beastliness\".\n\nA number of media outlets have compared the attempts by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant to establish territorial control in Iraq and Syria with the strategy outlined in \"Management of Savagery\". The first issue of the Islamic State's online magazine, \"Dabiq\", contained discussion of guerrilla warfare and tactics that closely resembled the writings and terminology used in \"Management of Savagery\", although the book was not mentioned directly. Journalist Hassan Hassan, writing in \"The Guardian\", reported an ISIL-affiliated cleric as saying that \"Management of Savagery\" is widely read among the group's commanders and some of its rank-and-file fighters. It was also mentioned by another member of ISIL in a list of books and ideologues that influence the group.\n\nAl-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been described by The Jamestown Foundation as following Naji's guidelines in Yemen, while the book has been mentioned positively in interviews with members of Somalia's Al-Shabaab.\n\nScholars Brian A. Jackson and Bryce Loidolt argue that \"Management of Savagery\" and Mustafa Setmariam Nasar's \"The Global Islamic Resistance Call\" led al-Qaeda to innovate and shift practices.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32102005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32102005", "title": "Medici-Laurentian Atlas", "text": "Medici-Laurentian Atlas\n\nThe Medici-Laurentian Atlas, also known simply as the Medici Atlas (and other variants, e.g. \"Laurenziano Gaddiano\", \"Laurentian Portolano\", \"Atlante Mediceo\" or \"Laurentian Atlas\"), is an anonymous 14th-century set of maps, probably composed by an Genoese cartographer and explicitly dated 1351, although most historians believe it was composed, or at least retouched, later. The atlas is currently held by the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, Italy.\n\nThe author of the Medici-Laurentian atlas is unknown, save that he comes from the Liguria region of Italy (probably Genoese), and might have composed it for a Florentine owner. The atlas is explicitly dated 1351 (as per its astronomical calendar), but scholars believed it was more likely composed around 1370, possibly from earlier material, and probably amended further later, with emendations as late as 1425-50.\n\nA 1370 date would place it in between the Pizzigani brothers map of 1367 and the Catalan Atlas of 1375, both of which share elements of the Medici-Laurentian map, although it is impossible to tell exactly if it preceded or followed them. It is also contemporaneous with the \"Libro del Conoscimiento\", a fantastical travelogue by an unknown Castilian author, believed to have been written sometime between 1350 and 1399, with which it shares many significant geographic features. The book's author may have inspired, or have been inspired by, the Medici-Laurentian atlas.\n\nThe Atlas is currently held by the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, Italy (Gaddi. Rel. 9).\n\nThe Medici-Laurentian atlas is composed of eight sheets. The first sheet is an astronomical calendar, the second sheet contains an unusual \"world map\", the third, fourth and fifth sheets compose a typical 14th-century portolan chart (covering Europe, North Africa, the Mediterranean and Black Seas), the sixth, seventh and eighth sheets are specialized charts of the Aegean Sea, Adriatic Sea and Caspian Sea.\n\nThe second sheet, the world map, is the one that has attracted most attention. If the original date 1351 is true, that would make it the first (extant) map to incorporate the travel reports of Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta. It shows Asia up to India, marking places like the Delhi Sultanate and others with reasonable accuracy. The atlas also shows the Caspian as a closed sea (unusual for maps of that time).\n\nAmong the most startling features is its depiction of the recognizable shape of the continent of Africa with remarkable prescience. Nearly a century before the Portuguese age of discovery, the Medici atlas draws the bend of the Gulf of Guinea and shows that Africa has a southern end, i.e. that the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are connected to each other below the African continent.\n\nWhile the remarkable shape of Africa has given rise to speculative theories about ancient sailing and secret voyages, the explanation is probably more mundane. The probable source of the \"Guinea bend\" is the legend of the \"Sinus Aethiopicus\", the rumor of a gulf that lay somewhere south of Cape Bojador that was said to penetrate deeply into the African continent. This gulf is described in the fantastical travelogue of the \"Libro del Conoscimiento\" (possibly as early as 1350) and finds itself again in the Fra Mauro map (1459), well before it was discovered by Portuguese explorers. The notion that the West African coast did not extend straight south but took a sharp eastward bend, could be a hazy reference to the actual Gulf of Guinea, but more probably it was just a lucky guess and a bit of wishful thinking. (Historian Russell notes that the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator was entranced by the legend of the \"Sinus Aethiopicus\", as it held out the prospect of a direct sea route around West Africa to the Christian kingdom of Prester John (Ethiopian Empire), avoiding the complications of travelling through the Muslim lands of Egypt to reach it. In the Medici Atlas, the depth of the penetration of the \"Sinus\" indeed almost reaches Ethiopia.)\n\nAs for the southward extension of the East African coast, uncommon for European maps, this was probably drawn from Arab sources, who would have known of the commercial traffic down the Muslim Swahili coast to Sofala. Finally, the connection between the two oceans under South Africa just ratifies the old assumption (from Biblical and Classical authority) that all the world's great water bodies were connected to each other. An Africa surrounded by water is already found on other maps (e.g. Pietro Vesconte's c. 1320 mappa mundi). Long before the Medici map, the Vivaldi brothers of Genoa, in 1291, had tried to sail down the west African coast, with the explicit objective of trying to find a sea route to Asia.\n\nThe imaginary nature of Africa's shape in the Medici map is almost proven by noticing there are no names or details given below Cape Bojador. The great exception is the legendary \"River of Gold\", the \"western Nile\" of Arab sources (i.e. the Senegal River, assumed connected to the Niger River, flowing through the heart of the gold-producing Mali Empire). This is the same \"Palolus\" river as in the Pizzigani brothers map of 1367. If one elects to date the Medici Atlas before the Pizzigani, then this is the first European map depicting that all-important river.\n\nThe Medici Atlas is also important for the history of the north Atlantic islands. It is probably the first map to benefit from the 1341 mapping expedition to the Canary Islands, sponsored by King Afonso IV of Portugal and commanded by the Florentine Angiolino del Tegghia de Corbizzi and the Genoese Nicoloso da Recco. The expedition is said to have visited thirteen Canary islands (seven major and six minor). The Medici Atlas shows most of the main Canary islands, excellently delineated (if not yet fully named), greatly improving upon the couple in the 1339 Angelino Dulcert map.\n\nThe Medici Atlas shows also for the first time, and almost correctly placed, the Madeira archipelago, with their modern names: \"Porto sto\" (Porto Santo), \"I. de lo Legname\" (Madeira, \"legname\" is Ligurian for \"wood\") and \"I dexerta\" (Desertas). The Madeira archipelago will not be officially discovered by the Portuguese until c. 1420. These names could have been in the original, or retouched later - although these same names were already given in the \"Libro del Conoscimiento\".\n\nThe Medici Atlas also seems to show the location of the Azores, being the first to do so. They are depicted northwest of the Madeira group, aligned on a north to south axis, rather than trailing diagonally from northwest to southeast. The islands are not all individually named, but rather named by cluster. Most southerly are the \"insule de Cabrera\" (\"Goat islands\", encompassing two islands, what seem like Santa Maria and São Miguel), further north is the individually named \"Insula Brasi\" (\"island of embers/fire\" (volcanic?) or \"dyewood\", either of which point to Terceira, but could also be the legendary Irish \"Brazil\"), then, just west of it, a group called \"insule de Ventura Sive de Columbis\" (\"islands of venture/winds or the pigeons\", three islands, probably São Jorge, Faial and Pico), and then, furthest north, are a cluster of two islands labelled \"insule de Corvis Marinis\" ('islands of the sea crows', Corvo and Flores). Only Graciosa seems to be missing.\n\nThese Azores islands appear with these names in two subsequent Majorcan maps - the 1375 Catalan Atlas and the 1385 map of Guillem Soler, with some more detailed sorting of the groups, e.g. Medici's \"Ventura Sive de Columbis\" label is broken into three distinct names: \"San Zorzo\" (\"St. George\", S. Jorge), \"Ventura\" (Faial) and \"Li Columbis\" (Pico); and the pair of \"Corvis Marinis\" are distinguished between \"Corvis Marinis\" (Corvo) and \"Li Conigi\" (\"rabbits\", Flores). The anonymous Castilian author of the \"Libro del Conoscimiento\" also supplies these names, breaking up the southerly Cabrera group (which the Catalan forgot) into the islands of \"las cabras\" (\"goats\", S. Miguel) and \"lobo\" (\"seals\"? S. Maria).\n\nNone of the Azores islands will be officially discovered until nearly a century later, in the 1430s and 1440s. They could simply be purely legendary, possibly of Andalusian Arab origin (e.g. al-Idrisi speaks of an Atlantic island of wild goats (the Cabras) and another of \"cormorants\", a scavenger bird, possibly the \"sea crows\" of Corvis Marinis?). But outside their erroneous axis tilt, the Azores do seem clustered with reasonable accuracy on the Medici atlas. One (unproven) possibility is that the Azores were indeed discovered, or at least seen from a distance, quite by accident, by the aforementioned 1341 mapping expedition on their return via a long sailing arc (\"volta do mar\") from the Canary islands.\n\n"}

He was the son of Nathaniel Ames first (1677–1736) and the father of Nathaniel third. The family was descended from William Ames of Bruton, Somerset, England, whose son William emigrated to Massachusetts and settled at Braintree as early as 1640.\n\nCaptain Nathaniel Ames, father of this entry’s subject, lived at Bridgewater and there married Susannah Howard on December 2, 1702. Six children were born to them, of whom Nathaniel second was the eldest son. His father is said to have been learned in astronomy and mathematics, as well as practicing medicine. Nothing is known of his son's education, but he became a physician, probably without other medical training than instruction from his father, apprenticeship to some country doctor, and reading medical volumes.\n\nIn 1725 he published the first annual number of his almanac, which was to become famous and remain the standard New England almanac for a half-century. At this time, he was still living at home in Bridgewater, and although the almanac bears on the title-page \"by Nathaniel Ames, Jr.,\" it may well be that the boy, then only seventeen years old, received some help from his mathematical parent. He is said to have moved to Dedham in 1732 and his name is entered from that place on the list of subscribers to Prince's \"Chronology\", to which most of the subscriptions were made in 1728. On September 14, 1735, he married Mary, daughter of Capt. Joshua Fisher of Dedham, by whom, on October 24, 1737, he had a son, Fisher Ames, who died less than a year later, on September 17, 1738, surviving his mother, however, who had died on November 11, 1737.\n\nAmes’ wife had owned a tavern and the situation gave rise to \"Ames v. Gay\", one of the famous lawsuits of New England. Ames (a compulsively litigious man) claimed inheritance to her estate according to the Province law through their son Fisher against his mother-in-law Hannah, who claimed the rights to it under the Common law, a struggle continued by her family after she died in December 1744. In August 1749 Ames won the case, and thus established an exception to the rule of inheritance in Massachusetts. However, two of the eleven Superior Court of Judicature justices were against him, leading the normally amiable Ames to an especially vituperative stance against lawyers for the rest of his career. He took down his tavern sign and replaced it with a cartoon of the judges, all easily identifiable. Each was shown studying the Province laws, except the two dissenters, who had their backs turned to the law books. Chief Justice Paul Dudley, one of the dissenters, sent the sheriff to arrest Ames and confiscate the libelous portrait. Ames was warned and quickly substituted Matt. 16:4: “A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it.”\n\nOn October 30, 1740, he married his second wife Deborah, daughter of Jeremiah Fisher, by whom he had six children, the eldest being Nathaniel third (1741–1822), and the third son being Fisher Ames. In that year, 1740, he was also one of the subscribers to the celebrated Land Bank. In addition to his duties as local doctor, as publisher of the almanacs, and as amateur astronomer, Ames for many years ran the well-known \"Sun\" tavern, which brought him an economically and politically strategic position; as taverns often doubled as courthouses, Ames was also a common lawyer, a business that aroused the anger of trained legal practitioners. The contemporary entry in John Whiting's Diary reads \"Jan. 25, 1750, Dr. Ames began to keep tavern”, although Briggs and Kittredge provide different dates for the commencement of this venture. He continued to live at Dedham until his death of fever in 1764. After Ames died, his widow continued to keep the tavern until she married Richard Woodward, when it became the Woodward Tavern, under which name it was known as the site where the Suffolk Resolves were drawn up in 1774. It was demolished in 1817 and is now the site of the Norfolk County Registry of Deeds.\n\nHis chief importance is as founder and editor of his almanacs, the publishing of which his son, Nathaniel third (a Harvard graduate and physician), continued for ten years after his father's death. The father issued the first number in 1725, three years before James Franklin started his in Rhode Island and eight years before Benjamin Franklin inaugurated \"Poor Richard's Almanack\". Ames must have been a household word throughout New England, for it is said that the circulation of his almanac, with its sharp-tongued commentary on Massachusetts politics, religion, and social life ran to 60,000 copies. Moses Coit Tyler considered it as superior to Franklin's, which it resembled in many ways. Besides the astronomical observations, Ames published short articles, extracts from the English poets, such as Milton and Pope, and used the same pithy and witty maxims as made the reputation of Franklin, such as: \"All men are created equal, but differ greatly in the sequel.\"\n\nHe had taste for good literature and considerable wit, though some of it seems a trifle forced today, and the quality rather improved when the almanac was continued by his somewhat abler son, who nevertheless was not the genial gentleman his father was, genuinely liking only farmers and despising printers. Ames, however, undoubtedly did much to bring, if only in brief allusions and extracts, some knowledge of the better English authors to innumerable New England farmhouses.\n\nAmes gave rise to an entire industry, and he had many imitators. Among those who followed in his footsteps was Dudley Leavitt of Meredith, New Hampshire, a teacher, newspaper publisher and polymath who published his first Leavitt's Farmers Almanack in 1797.\n\nIn 1775, during the Siege of Boston, Jabez Fitch, a young officer in the Colonial Army, visited Ames' tomb in the Old Village Cemetery in Dedham. Finding the tomb open, he entered, opened the casket, and examined the decomposing body.\n\n\n\n"}

They made items such as gloves, furniture mats, and army uniforms. The laundry room occupied the entire upper floor, the largest in San Francisco at the time.

Nothing happened for several minutes until the magnetometer reportedly \"jumped\". Montz said that unless there was an electromagnetic device in the building which would cause it to have taken place, then there was \"definitely paranormal activity taking place\".

{"id": "59129380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59129380", "title": "Qayyūm al-asmā", "text": "Qayyūm al-asmā\n\nQayyūm al-asmā (Arabic: قيوم الأسماء) - is the first long work of Siyyid `Alí Muhammad Shírází (Arabic: سيد علي محمد شيرازي) - the Báb. Also known as the Tafsir Surat Yusuf, This is an essay that was written as a commentary to Surah 12 in the Qur'an: Surat Yusuf (سورة يوسف). This composition is similar in its structure to the Qur'an itself: it contains 111 chapters (Surahs), each of which contains 42 sentences.\n\nIn the standard English translation, the name of the essay is \"Qayyūm al-asmā'\". Its meaning in Arabic is \"the maintainer of the names\". The names here refer to the 99 names of God in Islam. \"Existence\" (qayyum) is the name numbered 63. The book is sometimes called the Surat Yusuf (Surah interpretation of Joseph), or Ahsan al-Qisas (Arabic: best story of all stories), meaning the best story. Ahsan al-Qisas is a well-known name for Surat Yusuf in general and not necessarily related to the interpretation of the Báb in particular.\n\nQayyūm al-asmā is considered to be the first long book written by the Báb after 22 May 1844. On May 22, 1844, the Báb proclaimed himself as a revelation and divine missionary, and as the Báb, or the Imam or the messiah whom the Shiites are waiting to return at the end of days, to fill the earth with justice after being filled with oppression, and he who signifies the eschatological age and the end of human history. In Kitab-e Ikan (Farsi: The Book of Iqan), Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í religion, which developed from the Bábi doctrines, writes about Qayyūm al-asmā: \"[This is] the first of the books. According to evidence, the first surah of the book, called Surat al-Muluk (Arabic: Surah al-Maluk) (Surah of the Kings) was written in the presence of Mullah Hussein Bushru'i on the evening of May 22, 1844.\n\nAccording to the claims of Bábi believers, the writing the book - hundreds of pages long - was relatively short. It is described in the writings of the believers that the Báb wrote the entire book in 40 days, with a kind of ecstasy of divine inspiration. It should be noted, however, that academic sources disagree with the length of the period in which the book was written. Some believe that the number forty is typological only and does not necessarily indicate a period of exactly forty days. It is assumed that his writing took several months. Qayyūm al-asmā was the central book of the Bábi sect in its first year. Preachers of the Bábi faith, like Mullah Hussein Bushru'i, took copies of the essay and distributed it outside of Shiraz.\n\nThe composition consists of 111 Surahs, similar to the number of verses in the Quranic Surat Yusuf. At the top of each sura appears the basmalah (in Arabic: البسملة), meaning the Muslim saying, \"Bassem al-lah (al-rahim),\" which appears at the top of every sura in the Quran, with the exception of the ninth surah. The appearance of this formula, which is unique to the structure of the Koran, adds to the imagination that the author sought to create between the existence of al-Asma and the holy book of Islam. In addition to this formula, one can discern another Quranic characteristic in the existence of al-Asma - at the beginning of the Surahs there appear mysterious 'separate letters', similar to those in the Quran.\n\nThis composition is different from any regular interpretation of Surat Yusuf: Much of the book interprets the religious and messianic doctrines of the Báb, with a slight connection to the Quranic Surah. There are almost no elements in the composition that mention the interpretation of a typical Quran, but it is a kind of new composition that stands by itself. In the few times that the Báb writes an interpretation of any verse, this interpretation is in the form of an allegorical and esoteric interpretation - Tawil (Arabic: تأويل) and not a Tafsir (Arabic: تفسير).\n\nAs stated, this method of interpretation in the essay is allegorical-esoteric and mystical one (Arabic: تأويل) . It is a commentary which is actually a revelation. In this work, the interpretation of the Qur'an becomes a divine revelation, and revelation is used as a tool for interpretation. The entire composition is inspired by the model of the Quranic style, with a considerable amount of Quranic terminology. For example, in Sura 4 verse 13 in the Qayyūm al-asmā, the Báb writes: \"We [the Hidden Imam] have brought down this book about our servant and our servant [the ba'b] [by virtue of] a divine permit [in a form that] resembles [the Quran] In the first Surah of the Book, the Hidden Imam says: \"We have revealed to you [to the Báb] all that God has revealed to us [the imams].\" Here the Báb is depicted as a mediator between the Hidden Imam and humanity. \n\nAlong with these 'moderate' statements, one can find in the book 'bold' statements that describe this book as a new revelation from God, that is, as the new Quran. These statements bring the status of the Báb closer to that of a prophet. Elsewhere in the book one can find verses that proclaim the Báb as a divine manifestation of himself, i.e., as the Manifestation of God on earth: \"Indeed I am God, and there is no god but me\" (Al-Asmaa, Sura 22, 21).\n\n\n\n"}

This is typically applicable for:\n\nWhen a previous owner of shares dies and his shares are inherited by his personal representatives or heirs, this is called transmission of shares.Shares may be inherited only by production of probate of a will of the deceased owner or letters of administration of his estate granted by the High Court.(section 148 of COMPANIES AND ALLIED MATTERS ACT (CAMA)under NIGERIAN LAW ). The beneficiaries of the shares by transmission must have their names entered in the register of members of the company or elect a nominee to hold the shares on their behalf. In this case the nominee’s name shall be entered in the Register of members of the company to become a member of the company.(section 155 (3) of CAMA).\n\nTransmission of shares occurs when the shares of a deceased share holder are inherited or bequeathed to an heir or personal representative of the deceased shareholder. Where shares are held by two or more persons jointly then upon death of one or more of them, the surviving person shall be entitled to all the shares and they may be transferred to his name. Where the shareholder held the shares as a sole owner, then his shares may be transferred only to the person named in his will or if he died without a will, then to the person who obtains letters of administration from the High Court in respect of the shares or the deceased’s property. Section 148 of CAMA. The above are in Law recognized as the personal representatives of the deceased share holder and are entitled to have his shares transferred to them or their nominee. (Section 155 of CAMA).\n\nSometimes a deceased member may name some persons as the administrators of his estate who are to ensure the deceased’s properties are distributed and/or managed as stated in the will. These persons therefore inherit the deceased persons shares on behalf and for the benefit of those who are named in the will as the beneficiaries inherit. The administrators therefore only have an equitable right in the shares but not the beneficial rights.This right becomes a legal right only when the shares are transferred to those entitled under the will. It is the duty of the executors of the will who in this case are the personal representatives of the deceased to ensure that they nominate those entitled to the shares under the will as those to whom the shares should be transferred to.

The company shall then enter on the register of members the fact that such notice has been served on the company. The company shall therefore not register any transfer of shares of the deceased in respect of which it had received the affidavit of interest. \nAny company which receives this notice of interest and in default proceeds to register any transfer in favor of any other person shall be personally liable to the person who lodged the notice of interest for any loss he suffers thereby. (Section 156 of CAMA) \nThe Company shall give notice of at least 42 days to any other person seeking a transfer to him, of the shares complained of, for the matter to be resolved otherwise, the proposed transfer will not be effected. section 156 (2)CAMA.\n\"Ownership\": on registration of the transmission of shares, the person entitled to transmission of shares becomes the shareholder of the company and is entitled to all rights and subject to all liabilities as such shareholder.\n\n\"Method\": while transfer of shares is brought about by delivery of a proper instrument of transfer (viz, transfer deed) duly stamped and executed, transmission of shares is done by forwarding the necessary documents (such as a notarised copy of death certificate) to the company.\n\nIn the case of death, the surviving shareholders have to submit a request letter supported by an attested copy of the death certificate of the deceased shareholder and the relevant share certificates.

The building is constructed of Seneca red sandstone in the faux Norman style (a 12th-century combination of late Romanesque and early Gothic motifs; built in the Gothic and Romanesque revival styles) and is nicknamed The Castle. It was completed in 1855 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.\n\nThe Castle was the first Smithsonian building, designed by architect James Renwick, Jr., whose other works include St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and the Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery, also in Washington D.C. The building committee held a nationwide design competition in 1846 and selected Renwick's design by a unanimous vote. A cardboard model of Renwick's winning design survives and is on display in the Castle. Renwick was assisted by Robert Mills, particularly in the internal arrangement of the building.\n\nInitially intended to be built in white marble, then in yellow sandstone, the architect and building committee finally settled on Seneca red sandstone from the Seneca Quarry in Montgomery County, Maryland. The redstone was substantially less expensive than granite or marble, and while initially easy to work, was found to harden to a satisfactory degree on exposure to the elements. Scholarly evidence indicates it is likely that slaves were employed at Seneca in quarrying stone for the Castle, though no evidence has surfaced that slaves were involved in the actual Castle construction.\n\nThe building committee selected Gilbert Cameron as the general contractor, and construction began in 1847. The East Wing was completed in 1849 and occupied by Secretary Joseph Henry and his family. The West Wing was completed later the same year. A structural collapse in 1850 of partly completed work raised questions of workmanship and resulted in a change to fireproof construction. The Castle's exterior was completed in 1852; Renwick's work was completed and he withdrew from further participation. Cameron continued the interior work, which he completed in 1855. Construction funds came from \"accrued interest on the Smithson bequest.\"\n\nDespite the upgraded fireproof construction, a fire in 1865 caused extensive damage to the upper floor of the building, destroying the correspondence of James Smithson, Henry's papers, two hundred oil paintings of American Indians by John Mix Stanley, the Regent's Room and the lecture hall, and the contents of the public libraries of Alexandria, Virginia and Beaufort, South Carolina, confiscated by Union forces during the American Civil War. The ensuing renovation was undertaken by local Washington architect Adolf Cluss in 1865-67. Further fireproofing work ensued in 1883, also by Cluss, who by this time had designed the neighboring Arts and Industries Building. A third and fourth floor were added to the East Wing, and a third floor to the West Wing. Electric lighting was installed in 1895.\n\nAround 1900 the wooden floor of the Great Hall was replaced with terrazzo and a Children's Museum was installed near the south entrance. A tunnel connected to the Arts and Industries Building. A general renovation took place in 1968-70 to install modern electrical systems, elevators and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. The Enid A. Haupt Garden was dedicated in 1987, along with the Renwick Gate facing Independence Avenue, built from Seneca redstone retrieved from the demolished D.C. Jail.\n\nJames Renwick designed the Castle as the focal point of a picturesque landscape on the Mall, using elements from Georg Moller's \"Denkmäler der deutschen Baukunst\". Renwick originally intended to detail the building with entirely American sculptural flora in the manner of Benjamin Henry Latrobe's work at the United States Capitol, but the final work used conventional pattern-book designs.\n\nThe building is completed in the Gothic Revival style with Romanesque motifs. This style was chosen to evoke the Collegiate Gothic in England and the ideas of knowledge and wisdom. The façade is built with red sandstone from the Seneca quarry in Seneca, Maryland in contrast to the granite, marble and yellow sandstone from the other major buildings in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe building comprises a central section, two extensions or ranges, and two wings. Four towers contain occupiable space, while five smaller towers are primarily decorative, although some contain stairs. As constructed, the central section contained the main entry and museum space (now the Great Hall), with a basement beneath and a large lecture room above. Two galleries on the second floor were used to display artifacts and art. This area is now the Visitor's Information and Associates' Reception area. The East Range contained laboratory space on the first floor and research space on the second. The East Wing contained storage space on the first floor and a suite of rooms on the second as an apartment for the Secretary of the Smithsonian. This space is currently used as administrative offices and archives. The West Range was one story and used as a reading room. The West Wing, known as the chapel, was used as a library. The West Wing and Range are now used as a quiet room for visitors to go.\n\nOn the exterior, the principal tower on the south side is high and square. On the north side there are two towers, the taller on tall. A campanile at the northeast corner is square and tall.\n\nThe plan allowed for expansion at either end, a major reason for the informal medievally-inspired design, which would not suffer if asymmetrically developed.\n\nThe Smithsonian Castle houses the administrative offices of the Smithsonian. The main Smithsonian visitor center is also located here, with interactive displays and maps. Computers electronically answer most common questions. A crypt just inside the north entrance houses the tomb of James Smithson.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "225574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225574", "title": "Swordfish", "text": "Swordfish\n\nSwordfish (\"Xiphias gladius\"), also known as broadbills in some countries, are large, highly migratory, predatory fish characterized by a long, flat bill. They are a popular sport fish of the billfish category, though elusive. Swordfish are elongated, round-bodied, and lose all teeth and scales by adulthood. These fish are found widely in tropical and temperate parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and can typically be found from near the surface to a depth of . They commonly reach in length, and the maximum reported is in length and in weight.\n\nThey are the sole member of their family, Xiphiidae.\n\nThe swordfish is named after its pointed, flat bill, which resembles a sword. The species name, \"Xiphias gladius\", derives from Greek (\"xiphias\", \"swordfish\"), itself from (\"xiphos\", \"sword\") and from Latin (\"sword\"). This makes it superficially similar to other billfish such as marlin, but upon examination, their physiology is quite different and they are members of different families.\n\nThey commonly reach in length, and the maximum reported is in length and in weight. The International Game Fish Association's all-tackle angling record for a swordfish was a specimen taken off Chile in 1953. Females are larger than males, and Pacific swordfish reach a greater size than northwest Atlantic and Mediterranean swordfish. They reach maturity at 4–5 years of age and the maximum age is believed to be at least 9 years. The oldest swordfish found in a recent study were a 16-year-old female and 12-year-old male. Swordfish ages are derived, with difficulty, from annual rings on fin rays rather than otoliths, since their otoliths are small in size.\n\nSwordfish are ectothermic animals; however, along with some species of sharks, they have special organs next to their eyes to heat their eyes and brains. Temperatures of above the surrounding water temperature have been measured. The heating of the eyes greatly improves their vision, and consequently improves their ability to catch prey. Of the 25 000+ fish species, only 22 are known to have a mechanism to conserve heat. These include the swordfish, marlin, tuna, and some sharks.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the \"sword\" is not used to spear, but instead may be used to slash at its prey to injure the prey animal, to make for an easier catch. Mainly, the swordfish relies on its great speed and agility in the water to catch its prey. It is undoubtedly among the fastest fish, but the basis for the frequently quoted speed of is unreliable.\n\nSwordfish prefer water temperatures between , but have the widest tolerance among billfish, and can be found from . This highly migratory species typically moves towards colder regions to feed during the summer. Swordfish feed daily, most often at night, when they rise to surface and near-surface waters in search of smaller fish. During the day, they commonly occur to depths of and have exceptionally been recorded as deep as . Adults feed on a wide range of pelagic fish, such as mackerel, barracudinas, silver hake, rockfish, herring, and lanternfishes, but they also take demersal fish, squid, and crustaceans. In the northwestern Atlantic, a survey based on the stomach content of 168 individuals found 82% had eaten squid and 53% had eaten fish, including gadids, scombrids, butterfish, bluefish, and sand lance. Large prey are typically slashed with the sword, while small are swallowed whole.\nSwordfish are not schooling fish. They swim alone or in very loose aggregations, separated by as much as from a neighboring swordfish. They are frequently found basking at the surface, airing their first dorsal fin. Boaters report this to be a beautiful sight, as is the powerful jumping for which the species is known. This jumping, also called breaching, may be an effort to dislodge pests, such as remoras or lampreys.\nAlmost 50 species of parasites have been documented in swordfish. In addition to remoras, lampreys, and cookiecutter sharks, this includes a wide range of invertebrates, such as tapeworms, roundworms, and copepods. A comparison of the parasites of swordfish in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean indicated that some parasites, particularly Anisakis spp. larvae identified by genetic markers, could be used as biological tags and support the existence of a Mediterranean swordfish stock.\n\nFully adult swordfish have few natural predators. Among marine mammals, killer whales sometimes prey on adult swordfish. The shortfin mako, an exceptionally fast species of shark, sometimes take on swordfish; dead or dying shortfin makos have been found with broken-off swords in their heads, revealing the danger of this type of prey. Juvenile swordfish are far more vulnerable to predation, and are eaten by a wide range of predatory fish.\n\nIn the North Pacific, batch spawning mainly occurs in water warmer than during the spring and summer, and year-round in the equatorial Pacific. In the North Atlantic, spawning is known from the Sargasso Sea, and in water warmer than and less than deep. Spawning occurs from November to February in the South Atlantic off southern Brazil. Spawning is year-round in the Caribbean Sea and other warm regions of the west Atlantic.\n\nLarge females can carry more eggs than small females, and between 1 million to 29 million eggs have been recorded. The pelagic eggs measure in diameter and 2.5 days after fertilization, the embryonic development occurs. The surface-living and unique-looking larvae are long at hatching. The bill is evident when the larvae reach in length.\n\nSwordfish were harvested by a variety of methods at small scale (notably harpoon fishing) until the global expansion of long-line fishing. They have been fished widely since ancient times in places such as the Strait of Messina, where they are still fished with traditional wooden boats called feluccas and are part of the cuisine in that area.\n\nSwordfish are vigorous, powerful fighters. When hooked or harpooned, they have been known to dive so quickly, they have impaled their swords into the ocean bottom up to their eyes. Although no unprovoked attacks on humans have been reported, swordfish can be very dangerous when harpooned. They have run their swords through the planking of small boats when hurt. In 2015, a Hawaiian fisherman was killed by a swordfish after attempting to spear the animal.\n\nRecreational fishing has developed a subspecialty called swordfishing. Because of a ban on long-lining along many parts of seashore, swordfish populations are showing signs of recovery from the overfishing caused by long-lining along the coast.\n\nVarious ways are used to fish for swordfish, but the most common method is deep-drop fishing, since swordfish spend most daylight hours very deep. The boat is allowed to drift to present a more natural bait. Swordfishing requires strong fishing rods and reels, as swordfish can become quite large, and it is not uncommon to use five pounds or more of weight to get the baits deep enough during the day, up to 2,000 feet is common. Night fishing baits are usually fished much shallower, often less than . Standard baits are whole mackerel, herring, mullet, bonito, or squid; one can also use live bait. Imitation squids and other imitation fish lures can also be used, and specialized lures made specifically for swordfishing often have battery-powered or glow lights. Even baits are typically presented using glow sticks or specialized deepwater-proof battery operated lights.\n\nSwordfish are classified as oily fish. Many sources, including the United States Food and Drug Administration, warn about potential toxicity from high levels of methylmercury in swordfish. The FDA recommends that young children, pregnant women, and women of child-bearing age not eat swordfish. (See mercury in fish for more details.)\n\nThe flesh of some swordfish can acquire an orange tint, reportedly from their diet of shrimp or other prey. Such fish are sold as \"pumpkin swordfish\", and command a premium over their whitish counterparts.\n\nSwordfish is a particularly popular fish for cooking. Since swordfish are large animals, meat is usually sold as steaks, which are often grilled. Swordfish meat is relatively firm, and can be cooked in ways more fragile types of fish cannot (such as over a grill on skewers). The color of the flesh varies by diet, with fish caught on the East Coast of North America often being rosier.\n\nIn 1998, the US Natural Resources Defense Council and SeaWeb hired Fenton Communications to conduct an advertising campaign to promote their assertion that the swordfish population was in danger due to its popularity as a restaurant entree.\n\nThe resulting \"Give Swordfish a Break\" promotion was wildly successful, with 750 prominent US chefs agreeing to remove North Atlantic swordfish from their menus, and also persuaded many supermarkets and consumers across the country.\n\nThe advertising campaign was repeated by the national media in hundreds of print and broadcast stories, as well as extensive regional coverage. It earned the Silver Anvil award from the Public Relations Society of America, as well as\" Time\" magazine's award for the top five environmental stories of 1998.\n\nSubsequently, the US National Marine Fisheries Service proposed a swordfish protection plan that incorporated the campaign's policy suggestions. Then-US President Bill Clinton called for a ban on the sale and import of swordfish and in a landmark decision by the federal government, of the Atlantic Ocean were placed off-limits to fishing as recommended by the sponsors.\n\nIn the North Atlantic, the swordfish stock is fully rebuilt, with biomass estimates currently 5% above the target level. No robust stock assessments for swordfish in the northwestern Pacific or South Atlantic have been made, and data concerning stock status in these regions are lacking. These stocks are considered unknown and a moderate conservation concern. The southwestern Pacific stock is a moderate concern due to model uncertainty, increasing catches, and declining catch per unit effort. Overfishing is likely occurring in the Indian Ocean, and fishing mortality exceeds the maximum recommended level in the Mediterranean, thus these stocks are considered of high conservation concern.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the swordfish to its seafood red list.\n\nThe swordfish (\"Xiphias\") has been used by astronomers as another name for the constellation of Dorado.\n\n"}
{"id": "613578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=613578", "title": "The Amtrak Wars", "text": "The Amtrak Wars\n\nThe Amtrak Wars is a series of novels written by British author Patrick Tilley. The series is a post-apocalyptic science fiction with some fantasy elements such as the existence of magic. Six novels and an illustrated companion guidebook were published between 1983 and 1990, with additional books planned but never completed. The books have been optioned by an Australian production company with the intent of turning them into a series of feature films.\n\nIn AD 2015, the old world was destroyed in a nuclear war, known in the books variously as 'The Holocaust' and 'The War of a Thousand Suns'. The United States and Russia were involved in this nuclear war but who fired the first shot is not known. The resulting war lasted only a few hours, but between the nuclear exchange and the years of nuclear winter that followed, the overwhelming majority of the human race was annihilated.\n\nThe most organised band of survivors were the Amtrak Federation. Four hundred American citizens survived the nuclear war in a vast underground bunker beneath Houston, Texas. They established additional underground bunker-cities (known as divisional bases) linked by a high-speed subterranean rail network. Ruled by a self-perpetuating dynasty known as the First Family, the Federation expanded slowly in numbers and territory. By AD 2989, when the novels begin, the Federation sprawls across much of the south of the United States, from Colorado and Arizona to Mississippi. It is technologically advanced, employing microlight aircraft and 'wagon-trains', massive, 600-foot-long vehicles that act as land-based aircraft carriers and mobile HQs for heavily armed infantry personnel. The Federation's personnel are heavily susceptible to above-ground radiation and rarely live past their fortieth birthdays as a result.\n\nOrdinary citizens of the United States who managed to survive the nuclear war and adapt to the radiation mutated into a clan-based warrior society known as the Mutes. Adopting a warrior ethos and tribal society similar to Native Americans, the Mutes are primitive, employing spears and knives in combat. They are affected by a variety of radiation-induced infirmities, such as somewhat short-term memories and deformities varying in severity by individual. There are exceptions, Mutes with excellent recall who keep the tribe's traditions alive through an oral tradition of story-telling. These Mutes are known as wordsmiths. The Mutes would not present a significant threat to the Federation's vastly superior technology and weapons except for the existence of Mutes known as 'seers', who can foresee their moves, and 'summoners', who can use magical forces that the Federation has no defence against. The Federation leadership does not publicly acknowledge the existence of Mute magic and outlaws all discussion of its existence, to the anger of front-line combat veterans, who have seen it in action.\n\nThe third major surviving faction is known as the Iron Masters, though they refer to themselves as the Sons of Ne-Issan. According to their legends, the Iron Masters fled the destruction of their homeland of Nippon in vast floating cities that drifted into Antarctic waters and then up into the Atlantic, eventually landing on the Eastern Seaboard of the former United States. They founded a country known as the Shogunate of Ne-Issan, stretching from Nova Scotia to South Carolina and inland as far as the Great Lakes and Appalachian Mountains. The Iron Masters have developed gunpowder and great steam-powered ships, but custom, religion and political decree forbids them from developing technology based on the 'Dark Light' (electricity). Due to the growing threat of the Amtrak Federation, some Iron Masters believe that without embracing the Dark Light, their nation stands little chance against the Federation's superior technology and will be destroyed, but official policy is to maintain the edict.\n\nIn AD 2989, a 17-year-old, newly qualified Amtrak pilot named Steve Brickman joins the \"Lady from Louisiana\", a wagon-train in its first major assault on the Plainfolk Mutes. Thanks to the Mutes' deployment of sorcery, the wagon-train is defeated and forced to retreat. Brickman is taken prisoner by the Mutes but not killed, due to a prophetic vision of the clan's seer, Mr. Snow, which suggests Steve will be instrumental in the fulfilment of the Talisman Prophecy. This suggests a 'chosen one' called \"Talisman\" will arise to destroy the Federation and lead the Mutes to victorious domination of the world. Steve comes to admire and respect the Mutes; he falls in love with a \"straight\" (mutation-free) Mute woman named Clearwater and forges a bond of mutual respect with Mr. Snow's apprentice, Cadillac.\n\nSteve eventually escapes from the Mutes and returns to the Federation, but his account of his imprisonment and escape is deemed fantastical. Labelled a deserter, he is stripped of all rank and is publicly disgraced. Privately, Steve is recruited by the Federation's top-secret intelligence organisation, AMEXICO, and is sent on a new assignment to capture Cadillac, Clearwater, and Mr. Snow, who are deemed of interest to the Federation. Upon learning that Cadillac has used information from Steve to build a primitive glider and fly it to Ne-Issan as part of a weapons and intelligence exchange between the Mutes and Iron Masters, Steve decides to pursue the capture mission into Ne-Issan. During this mission, Steve's loyalties become further conflicted between his affinity with the Mutes and his birth allegiance to the Federation, and he begins a risky attempt to play both sides against the middle whilst he looks for a way to escape his enemies on both sides.\n\n\nThere are three types of gifted mutes, two of which possesses magical abilities. They are:\n\n\n\nThere is also a rare guide to the Amtrak Wars world titled \"\", (Sphere Books, 1988).\n\nIn 1998 Orbit Books reissued the \"Amtrak Wars\" series with new covers and in a revised form that saw the Amtrak Federation renamed as the 'Lone Star Confederation'. The final volume was also mildly re-edited to remove the definitive afterword/conclusion of the original series, leaving the book on more of a cliffhanger.\n\n\"The Amtrak Wars\" is notable for having a cliffhanger ending to the final volume, in which two of the main characters are killed, one of the three main civilisations is plunged into civil war and two children are born with pre-ordained destinies. However, since 1990 there have been no further additions to the series.\n\nIn a letter dated 26 August 1991 Patrick Tilley confirmed that both the fans and publishers wanted additional novels to be published in the series and he was pursuing the matter, but only if he could \"make it good enough.\". Rumours circulated for several years that additional novels in the sequence were being written, reaching a height in 1999 when a seventh volume was listed for publication by several websites. Unsubstantiated rumours surfaced in 2001 that Book 7 would be called \"Ghost Rider\", and that one of the characters killed at the end of book 6 wasn't actually dead.\n\nIn 2007 Patrick Tilley once again hinted that the series would continue, although possibly only as a trilogy rather than six more books.\n\nIn 2007 the books were optioned by an Australian production company with the intention of turning them into a series of feature films. In 2008-09 Patrick Tilley wrote a draft of the first script, entitled like the book, \"Cloud Warrior\", and the production company continued pursuing the project in 2010, showing the script and tentative production artwork to several companies at the Cannes Film Festival. The proposed movie series is entitled \"The Talisman Prophecy\" rather than \"The Amtrak Wars\" and continues the practice from the revised edition of naming the Amtrak Federation as 'The Lone Star Confederation'. Other changes include proposed variations to the design of Federation vehicles and technology from the books, and the removal of Ne-Issan to the Pacific North-West rather than the Eastern Seaboard.\n\n"}

It is also the only Muppet feature film directed by Henson. Shot in Great Britain and London in 1980, the film was released shortly after the final season of \"The Muppet Show\".\n\nKermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo are investigative reporters for the \"Daily Chronicle\" newspaper. Kermit and Fozzie, specifically, play identical twin reporters, which becomes the source of a running gag—supposedly, nobody can tell they are twins when Fozzie removes his hat. One day, after the trio fail to report on a major jewel robbery, they ask their editor to allow them to travel to London to investigate the robbery and interview the victim, prominent fashion designer Lady Holiday. Statler and Waldorf make appearances throughout the film to heckle them and the audience.\n\nWith only $12 for the trip, they're forced to travel in an aeroplane's baggage hold and are thrown out of the plane as it passes over Britain.

The next morning, when Kermit seeks out Lady Holiday in her office, however, he instead finds her newly-hired receptionist, the alluring Miss Piggy, and mistakes her for the fashion designer. Piggy poses as Lady Holiday, and asks Kermit out for dinner; to keep up the pose, she allows Kermit to assume she lives at a \"highbrow\" address. She sneaks into a townhouse at 17 Highbrow Street to wait for him, much to the surprise of the actual upper-class British residents, and they go to dinner at a nightclub.\n\nAt the nightclub, the real Lady Holiday's necklace is stolen by her jealous brother Nicky and his accomplices Carla, Marla, and Darla, three of her put-upon fashion models (the very same thieves who robbed her before). After the robbery, Miss Piggy's charade is revealed and she flees, leaving Kermit behind, though they later reconcile in a park. Despite Nicky's instant attraction to Miss Piggy, he and his accomplices frame her for the necklace theft and plan to steal an even more valuable prize: Lady Holiday's largest and most valuable jewel, the Fabulous Baseball Diamond, now on display at the local Mallory Gallery. Gonzo overhears their plot. He, Kermit, Fozzie, and the other residents of the Happiness Hotel decide to intercept the thieves and catch them red-handed to exonerate Miss Piggy.\n\nThe Muppets sneak into the Mallory Gallery, and get to the Baseball Diamond at the same time as the thieves. They try to keep the diamond out of the thieves' hands via a game of keep away, which turns into baseball, but Nicky eventually catches the diamond and takes Kermit hostage. However, in the meantime, Piggy escapes from prison, and she races to the Mallory Gallery, crashing through the window on a motorcycle that serendipitously fell off a truck in front of her. She knocks Nicky out and dispatches Carla, Marla and Darla with a flurry of furious karate chops. As the police arrive, all charges against Piggy are dropped, Nicky and his accomplices are arrested, and the Muppets get their deserved credit for foiling the heist.\n\nThe Muppets then return to the United States the same way they departed, being thrown out of the cargo hold and parachuting back to the United States, over the end credits.\n\n\n\n\nThe film made $20 million in the US and was considered a box office disappointment. Some thought the use of the word \"caper\" in the title was a mistake.\n\nIt is the fifth-highest grossing Muppet film behind \"The Muppets\" (2011), \"The Muppet Movie\" (1979), \"Muppets Most Wanted\" (2014) and \"Muppet Treasure Island\" (1996).\n\n\"The Great Muppet Caper\" has received generally positive reviews. The film holds a 79% approval rating based on 20 reviews on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 6.5/10. The site's consensus says \"\"The Great Muppet Caper\" is overplotted and uneven, but the appealing presence of Kermit, Miss Piggy and the gang ensure that this heist flick is always breezily watchable.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film a two star rating (out of four) and concluded his review by saying that \"the lack of a cutting edge hurts this movie. It's too nice, too routine, too predictable, and too safe.\"\n\n\"The Great Muppet Caper\" was first released on Betamax, VHS, and LaserDisc in 1982 by 20th Century Fox Video. Jim Henson Video through Buena Vista Home Video re-released the film on VHS and LaserDisc in 1993. The movie was reissued on VHS by Columbia Tristar Home Video and Jim Henson Home Entertainment in 1 June, 1999. It was later released on DVD by Sony Pictures and Jim Henson Home Entertainment on 10 July 2001 and subsequently on 29 November 2005 by Walt Disney Home Entertainment as \"Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition\".\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released \"The Great Muppet Caper\" on Blu-ray and DVD, alongside \"Muppet Treasure Island\", on 10 December 2013.\n\nIn 1982, Joe Raposo was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"The First Time It Happens\" but lost to \"Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do)\" by Burt Bacharach, Carole Bayer Sager, Christopher Cross and Peter Allen from \"Arthur\". This was the only one of the first three Muppet films not to be nominated for Best Music, Original Song Score.\n\nIn 1981, Miss Piggy won the Youth in Film Award for Best Young Musical Recording Artist for her performance of \"The First Time It Happens\", becoming the first, and only, non-human recipient in the history of the award.\n\n\"The Great Muppet Caper: The Original Soundtrack\" contains all of the songs from the film, as well as several portions of dialogue and background score. The album reached #66 on \"Billboard\"'s Top LP's and Tapes chart in 1981.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4009794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4009794", "title": "War (Bob Marley song)", "text": "War (Bob Marley song)\n\n\"War\" is a song recorded and made popular by Bob Marley. It first appeared on Bob Marley and the Wailers' 1976 Island Records album, \"Rastaman Vibration\", Marley's only top 10 album in the USA. (In UK it reached position 15 May 15, 1976.) The lyrics are almost entirely derived from a speech made by Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I before the United Nations General Assembly on 4 October 1963.\n\n\"War\" is credited to Allen \"Skill\" Cole (idea) and Carlton Barrett (music); the music was an extension of the one-drop drumming style, which Carlton Barrett had developed and refined, if not invented. The lyrics are a near-exact repetition of a speech in the UN by the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie. However, the two simple guitar chords and the semi-improvised, spirited melody put to Selassie's words is unmistakably Marley's.\n\nAccording to Stephen Davis' biography \"Bob Marley,\" it also appears that Marley had credited several of his multi-million selling 1974-1976 songs to close friends and relatives because he was under an unfavorable publishing contract, signed in April 1968 with Cayman Publishing, that would have otherwise deprived him of much of his songwriting royalties. Crediting close friends, such as football player Allen \"Skill\" Cole or Wailers drummer Carlton \"Carly\" Barrett therefore enabled Bob Marley to circumvent the law until new, more favorable agreements were made. This practice, along with the practice of rewarding friends who contributed to compositions by crediting them — even if they only contributed with ideas — and Marley's sudden death without leaving a will all combined to create confusion about the copyright status of several songs, including \"War\".\n\nBarrett's brother, Wailer musician Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett (who created the bass line, key to the song's efficiency) has since brought lawsuits against the Marley estate (in practice, the widow Rita Marley) for unpaid royalties and credit for songs such as \"War\" that were claimed to have been either written by others and not by Bob Marley, or in collaboration with Marley. One such suit reached a settlement in 1994 in which Barrett was paid $500,000. Barrett later continued to pursue legal action, seeking £60 million ($113.6 million at the time) in a suit against the Island-Universal record label and the Marley family, but the case was dismissed on the grounds that the earlier settlement proscribed any further claim on the estate\n\nBob Marley was a talented song writer, but during the ska-, rocksteady- and the primitive reggae era, only Peter Tosh could play the guitar in The Wailers. Carlton Barrett was considered the most promising young reggae drummer in Jamaica when he belonged to Lee \"Scratch\" Perry's studio band The Upsetters, and when Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer broke with Perry in 1972, they took the Barrett brothers with them. The Barrett Brothers have a very large part in the development of Bob Marley's special sound, that does not sound like other reggae music. When Tosh and Wailer left 1973, it was Aston Barrett's idea to rearrange the band's music room, to create a rehearsal room, and set it up like a little demo studio to tape the new concept of lyrics, melodies, and music. Bob Marley and the Wailers started to prepare themselves much better musically before they were ready to go into the studio. The first work was the album called \"Natty Dread\" 1974 (where \"No Woman No Cry\" and \"Rebel Music\" can be found, and the second album was \"Rastaman Vibration\" with the songs \"War\" and \"Want More\" (Aston Barrett). After Marley's death, it was not easy to determine who did what in creating music. The songs grew naturally through rehearsals, etc., but when it came to Bob Marley and the Wailers, the band members were convinced that they were led by a prophet who inspired them all. Bob Marley was extremely charismatic, and after his death in 1981 many of the band members had difficulties making a living, sometimes due to depression and personal crises. The royalty battles are really deeply tragic, but the situation has improved in many ways since Marley's sons David (Ziggy) and Stephen took over the heritage, the copyrights and the responsibility.\n\nAs taught by the Original Gong, Leonard P Howell, Marley, along with fellow Rastafari, worship Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia as the incarnation of God, and refer to him as \"Ras Tafari,\" \"Jah\" or \"The Lion of Judah\" which Marley does in many of his songs. To him, Selassie was not only one of the most prominent African leaders of his time, he was also identified as God returning to earth as \"King of Kings, Lord of Lords\" (Revelation 19, 16), imperial titles born both by Selassie I and Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II before him. It was Menelik II, however, who created this self-styled imperial title in the late 19th Century after he succeeded in uniting his country, later known as Ethiopia. Marley did however accept Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity 8 months before his passing.\nHaile Selassie I gave the \"War\" speech on October 4, 1963, calling for world peace at the 1963 U.N. Conference in New York City. This historical speech was spoken a few weeks after the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was founded in Ethiopian capital city Addis Ababa where Selassie chaired a summit meeting gathering almost every African head of state (The King of Morocco had declined the invitation).\n\nThis U.N. speech resounded even louder as Haile Selassie I had made a name for himself on the international scene in 1936, when he spoke at The League of Nations in Geneva. It was there that Selassie warned the world that if member state Ethiopia was not militarily supported by other member states to fight the fascist Italian invasion of his country then taking place, as the League of Nations statute guaranteed, the League would then cease to exist as a matter of fact and the rest of the member states were to suffer the same fate as his country. Three years later World War II broke out. This visionary speech granted Selassie much respect around the world, eventually leading to British military support, which helped freeing his country in 1941. Addressing the world again in 1963, Selassie's words bore full weight. In picking this utterance for lyrics, Bob Marley thus projected two dimensions of the Ethiopian Emperor: the head of state as well as the Living God Rastafarian see with him.\n\nAlthough credited to Emperor Haile Selassie I, whose Christian name is Tafari Makonen, the real author of the text remains uncertain. It is sometimes believed that it was written by Lorenzo Tazaz, a close contributor who wrote many of the Ethiopian leader's most important speeches, including a historic one given in 1935 to the League of Nations. But Tazaz died in 1947, over fifteen years before the 1963 U.N. utterance. Spoken in Ethiopia's official Amharic language at the U.N., the 1963 speech was published in English in \"Important Utterances of H.I.M. Emperor Haile Selassie I 1963-1972\". The book gave permission to freely use its contents: \"Any portion of this book could be reproduced by any process without permission.\" The song uses part of Selassie's speech that calls for equality among all without regard to race, class, or nationality in his hymnal cry for peace. It also asserts, quoting Selassie directly, that until the day of an equal society, there will be war. In the original speech, Selassie urged U.N. officials and country representatives to disarm nuclear weapons, and to end international exploitation (specifically with Africa). The song honors Haile Selassie I while calling for action against racial inequality and international injustice. The part of the speech used by Bob Marley was preceded by the following words:\n\nLast May, in Addis Ababa, I convened a meeting of Heads of African States and Governments. In three days, the thirty-two nations represented at that Conference demonstrated to the world that when the will and the determination exist, nations and peoples of diverse backgrounds can and will work together. In unity, to the achievement of common goals and the assurance of that equality and brotherhood which we desire. On the question of racial discrimination, the Addis Ababa Conference taught, to those who will learn, this further lesson:\n\nHere is the part of Haile Selassie's speech put to music by Marley in his original song \"War\" (Bob Marley slightly modified the original words, changing each \"that until\" to \"until\" and added the word \"war\" several times):\n\nThat until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior is finally and permanently discredited and abandoned; That until there are no longer first-class and second-class citizens of any nation; That until the color of a man's skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes; That until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all without regard to race; That until that day, the dream of lasting peace and world citizenship and the rule of international morality will remain but a fleeting illusion, to be pursued but never attained; And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes that hold our brothers in Angola, in Mozambique and in South Africa in subhuman bondage have been toppled and destroyed; Until bigotry and prejudice and malicious and inhuman self-interest have been replaced by understanding and tolerance and good-will; Until all Africans stand and speak as free beings, equal in the eyes of all men, as they are in the eyes of Heaven; Until that day, the African continent will not know peace. We Africans will fight, if necessary, and we know that we shall win, as we are confident in the victory of good over evil.\" – Haile Selassie I\n\nHere are the lyrics from the Bob Marley and the Wailers at the album Rastaman Vibration:\n\nA different mix, which includes a different horn arrangement, released as a bonus track in the Deluxe Edition (2002) of the Rastaman Vibration album, revealed that Marley had recorded an extra verse also adapted from the original speech:\n\nUntil bigotry and prejudice, malicious and inhuman self-interest have been replaced by understanding and tolerance and good will, yeah, war. Until all Africans stand and speak as free beings equal in the eyes of the almighty, war. Everywhere is war.\n\nIn his speech to the U.N., Selassie reminded his listeners that \"these are only words; their value depends wholly on our will to observe and honor them and give them content and meaning.\"\n\nThe original version of \"War\" was recorded at Harry J's studio in Kingston, Jamaica, by engineer Sylvan Morris. It includes Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett on Fender Jazz bass, his brother Carlton 'Carly' Barrett on drums, Earl \"Chinna\" Smith on guitar, Alvin \"Seeco\" Patterson on percussion and Tyrone Downie on keyboards. Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Rita Marley sing harmony vocals as the I Three. It was produced by Bob Marley & The Wailers and mixed at Miami's Criteria studio by Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett and Chris Blackwell with engineer Alex Sadkin.\n\nWith such potent and meaningful lyrics, the song soon became one of Bob Marley's greatest classics, carrying the Rastafari message to the world in Haile Selassie I's own words. As from 1977, when Bob Marley & The Wailers embarked for their first major world tour in June, \"War\" was sung at most concerts until Marley's last show on September 23, 1980 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Two live recordings of the song have since been released officially by Tuff Gong/Island Records. The first one was issued on the 1978 \"Babylon by Bus\" album recorded live at the Pavillon de Paris in Paris, France on June 26, 1978. The second was recorded at the Rainbow Theatre in London, England on June 4, 1977, and was issued on the 2001 Deluxe Edition of the Exodus album. Predating these two is another version, recorded on May 26, 1976 and released in 2003 on Live at the Roxy.\n\nTwo other hit versions of the song featuring Bob Marley & the Wailers can also be heard. A vinyl single released in Jamaica on Bruno Blum's Human Race label in December 1997 includes samples of Bob Marley's voice saying \"Rastafari is the prince of Peace.\" But most importantly, the song features the original recording of Haile Selassie I's Amharic speech done in 1963, overdubbed on a new rhythm track played by Wailers original members. The B-side offers a welcome English translation of the speech by Bruno Blum, whose spoken rendition of \"War\" includes the second part of the speech not used by Bob Marley:\n\nA second mix of this new recording was also released, charting at the #1 spot in the U.K. Echoes magazine in April 1998. This time it featured samples of Bob Marley & the Wailers' song \"Selassie Is the Chapel\" (adapted from \"Crying in the Chapel\"), where Bob and Rita Marley's voices can be heard on a sizeable part of the record, as well as Selassie's original \"foundation lead vocal,\" creating a virtual duet between Haile Selassie I and his apostle Bob Marley. Both new versions were recorded at Kingston Musick Studio in Kingston, Jamaica, engineered by Rudy Thomas. They include Wailers survivors Aston \"Family Man\" Barrett on bass guitar and piano, Mikey \"Boo\" Richards\" on drums and Earl \"Wire\" Lindo on keyboards, along with guitar and backing vocals by Bruno Blum. Percussionist Norbert \"Nono\" Nobour and backing singer Tatiana Prus were later added. The sessions were produced by Bruno Blum and mixed by Thierry Bertomeu at AB Studio in St. Denis, France.\n\nReleased in Europe on Blum's Rastafari label in early 1998, both \"War\" and \"War/Selassie Is the Chapel\" were successful singles contributing to the \"new roots\" reggae scene where Rastafari themes sung by the likes of Garnett Silk, Luciano and Dennis Brown were popular again after more than a decade of decline. Several singles derived from this new recording were subsequently issued on the label, including Buffalo Bill's \"War\"/\"Warmongers\", Big Youth's \"We No Want No War\" and Joseph Cotton's \"Conflicts\" backed by Doc Reggae's spoken French version \"Guerre\". A full length CD album entitled \"The War Album\", including all versions, was issued in Europe on the Rastafari label in 2001. A vinyl album was released in Jamaica on the Human Race label in 2004, and the full \"War Album\" was reissued in 2010 as part of the Human Race label double CD anthology.\n\n\n"}

Originally published in 1984, the book consistently tops \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list in the paperback advice category, is one of \"USA Today\"s \"25 Most Influential Books\" of the past 25 years and has been described as \"the bible of American pregnancy\". , over 14.5 million copies were in print. According to \"USA Today\", 93 percent of all expectant mothers who read a pregnancy guide read \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\". In 2012, \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\" was adapted into a film released by Lionsgate.\n\nThe book presents advice in a question-and-answer format. It proceeds chronologically from the time a woman first begins to suspect pregnancy, through each of the nine months (with one chapter devoted to each), and into the postpartum period. The beginning of each chapter succinctly lists common physical and emotional changes and symptoms a woman may be experiencing, and gives information on what a woman can expect when visiting her doctor or nurse midwife during checkups. Also included early in each chapter is a section entitled \"A Look Inside\" which displays pictures of the changing female anatomy and the growing embryo then fetus. Additional information in sections titled \"What You May Be Concerned About\" and \"What It's Important to Know\" is designed to address a wide range of concerns, problems and life trends.\n\nEach edition includes substantial nutrition information discussing caloric intake, maintaining balanced meals and provides sample recipes. Recent editions include a complete nutrition plan.\n\nThe book's appendix lists additional sources of information and resources including government organizations, associations and foundations.\n\nAuthor Heidi Murkoff cites her own quest for reassuring information during her first pregnancy as being the motivation for developing \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\". Murkoff collaborated with her mother Arlene Eisenberg, a freelance journalist and her sister Sandee Hathway, a nurse when developing the pregnancy guide.\n\n\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\" has been criticized for promoting paranoia and fear among pregnant women for focusing on complications and for its extremely strict dietary guidelines. Murkoff also has no medical training and has been further criticized for stating she asks obstetricians to comment on manuscripts only late in the writing and editing processes. With the first publishing of the book being in 1984, one reason it is considered problematic is due to the many old and unrevised printings in public circulation. Although wording is revised with each new edition to respond to critiques, older copies are passed down by women to their pregnant peers.\n\nThe author went on to develop a \"What to Expect\" series:\n\nIn 2000, the author, and former publishing executive, Lisa Bernstein, founded the What to Expect Foundation whose stated mission is to help low-income families expect healthy pregnancies, safe deliveries and happy babies. The Foundation reports that millions of impoverished women do not have access to free comprehensive pregnancy guides which led to the development of \"Baby Basics\" a book and education program delivering prenatal health literacy.\n\nEven though the book does not contain a storyline, Lionsgate adapted \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\" into a film of the same name directed by Kirk Jones. It features an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks, Anna Kendrick, Chris Rock, Brooklyn Decker, Rodrigo Santoro, Rob Huebel, Chace Crawford and Matthew Morrison. The film was released on May 18, 2012.\n\n"}

Losing the fight for supremacy, he was beheaded and his head buried in Changyang Mountain. Nevertheless, headless, with a shield in one hand and a battle axe in the other, he continues the fight, using his nipples as eyes and his bellybutton as a mouth.\n\nXingtian was an official under Yandi. Yandi fought against Huangdi for the position of supreme god, but he lost the conflict. Xingtian still continued the fight after Yandi's defeat, but was defeated and decapitated by Huangdi. Eventually, he regenerated himself and continued his defiance, which was expressed by a martial dance.\n\nXingtian appears in chapter 7 of the \"Shanhaijing\" (\"Classic of Mountains and Seas\"), which states that he fought and lost against the supreme god to become the supreme divinity. The god decapitated Xingtian and buried his head on Changyang Mountain. However, Xingtian persevered, using his nipples as his eyes, using his navel as his mouth, and brandishing his shield and ax. The \"Shanhaijing\" states the following:\n\n\"Xingtian and the Supreme God Di came to this place and struggled against each other for ultimate power. The Supreme God cut off Xingtian's head\nand buried him at Eternally Auspicious Mountain. Xiangtian's nipples then transformed into eyes, and his navel became a mouth.

He mentions the similarity between Xingtian and the corpse of Geng of the Xia, since they were both characters who regenerated and continued their resistance.\n\nThe poet Tao Qian also celebrated Xingtian's spirit in his \"Thirteen Poems upon Reading the Guideways through Mountains and Seas\", where he made an association between Jingwei and Xingtian in their persistence to overcome tragedies but also mentions their inability to be free from it:\n\n\"<nowiki>[</nowiki>Jingwei<nowiki>]</nowiki> bites hold of twigs, determined to fill up the deep-blue sea. Xingtian dances wildly with spear and shield, his old ambitions still burn fiercely. After blending with things, no anxieties should remain. After metamorphosing, all one's regrets should flee. In vain do they cling to their hearts from the past. How can they, a better day, foresee?\"\n\nXingtian symbolizes the indomitable spirit which maintains the will to resist no matter what tribulations one may undergo or what troubles one may encounter. As such, Xingtian has been lauded in poetry and prose.\n\n\n"}
