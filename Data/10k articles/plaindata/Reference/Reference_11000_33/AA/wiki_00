The book was awarded a Special Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1972. A revised and enlarged edition was published in 1989.\n\nIn the preface to the 1989 second edition of \"A Catalogue of Crime\", Jacques Barzun credits the contributions of Wendell Hertig Taylor, who died in November 1985. \"He had finished, I am happy to say, his half of the substantive work [and] is therefore as fully co-author of this edition as of the first. Had he lived, it would have appeared much sooner.\"\n\nThe work contains 952 pages. It is divided as follows:\n\n\nThe book contains a total of 5,045 entries sorted, in each of the sections, in alphabetical order by the author's last name; where there is more than one entry for an author, each is in alphabetical order of the name of the work. Some entries are very short (one might say curt): one such—the only one for the author named—is:\n\n1587 GRIFFIN, FRANK, \"Appointment with My Lady\" West 1946\n\n\"A good opening chapter, after which everything goes to pieces. The narrator-hero always shouts and commits acts, including murder, without rhyme or reason.\"\n\nThe \"West 1946\" refers to the publisher, John Westhouse Publishers, and to the year of publication.\n\nHowever, there are fifty-one entries for the prolific Agatha Christie. Christie wrote many other mystery stories, using several different detectives but Barzun and Taylor chose to review these only.\n\nThe first entry (no. 749) for her \"After the Funeral\", published in 1953, says in part:\n\n\"Not one of Agatha's best. The scheme is obvious and worked repetitiously.\"\n\nThe last entry (no. 799) for her \"Why Didn't They Ask Evans?\", published in 1935, contains three sentences, one of which is:\n\n\"The merit consists largely in Agatha's maintaining suspense about the small mystery of a name.\"\n\nThe other forty-nine entries for Christie are quite mixed. They range in praise (or lack thereof) from:\n\n\"A Poirot story, and very dull...\" (entry no. 768, re \"Hickory, Dickory, Death\", published in 1956) to:\n\n\"A triumph of her art...of motive-building. That is where A.C. is unrivaled. She knows how to make plausible the divergence between action and motive that maintains uncertainty until the physical clues...mesh with motive to disclose the culprit.\" (entry no. 769 re \"The Hollow\", published in 1946).\n\nPart V \"The Literature of Sherlock Holmes...\" contains 81 entries (numbers 4965 through 5045). Included are, of course, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself, the originator of Holmes and the author of the 60 Holmes stories (56 short stories and four novelas). Also represented are a host of writers, some well-known from their works in other fields, and others little known to the general public but recognized by Sherlockian scholars as having made notable contributions to the Holmesian literature.\n\nAmong the former are Isaac Asimov, the renowned science-fiction writer; the Roman Catholic clergyman Ronald Knox; and Christopher Morley, a long-time writer for the \"Saturday Review of Literature\" and author of some 50 literary works, among the best known of which are \"Kitty Foyle\" and \"Parnassus on Wheels\"; and, of course, Jacques Barzun himself. In the latter category are Dorothy Sayers, the British crime novelist (whose Lord Peter Wimsey stories are the best known); Howard Haycraft, a U.S. publishing executive whose \"The Art of the Mystery Story\" (published in 1946) is a recognized survey of the mystery genre; and Edgar Smith, a General Motors corporate executive who was one of the U.S. founders of the Baker Street Irregulars, the first organized group in the United States dedicated to the formation of local groups of Holmes aficionados around the country (called \"scion societies\") for the purpose of meeting regularly for the scholarly study of the Holmes adventures and to participate in such activities of other scion societies, in the United States and around the world.\n\n\"A Catalogue of Crime\" received a Special Edgar Award in 1972 from the Mystery Writers of America.\n\nThe book won immediate praise for its sections on studies and histories of crime fiction, true crime, the Sherlock Holmes canon and stories of the supernatural, and for assembling the most complete annotated bibliography of mystery and detective fiction then known. But upon its publication and in the years since, \"A Catalogue of Crime\" has been criticized for its errors, omissions and genteel point of view. Ross Macdonald's May 1971 review for \"The New York Times\" is headed, \"A study of mystery and detective fiction—massive and limited\":\n\nWe are given pages of descriptions of books by such respectable but pedestrian writers as John Rhode and Freeman Wills Crofts, while a brilliant innovator and master of construction like Eric Ambler is represented in the main descriptive text by two books. Graham Greene, perhaps the most distinguished crime novelist of this century, is represented by a single early work, \"A Gun for Sale,\" with the thumbs-down comment, \"Suspense only.\" Georges Simenon has just one entry. Jorge Luis Borges, probably Poe's greatest living literary descendant, is left out entirely. ... An even more striking and inexplicable omission is that of Dashiell Hammett's \"The Glass Key\", which was Hammett's own favorite among his novels.\n\n\"While any ambitious bibliographical/critical work of this scope is bound to contain errors, \"A Catalogue of Crime\" has some true honkers,\" wrote Kevin Burton Smith, editor of The Thrilling Detective website. \"Some of the omissions are truly jaw-dropping, and some of the critiques are almost cute in their old-fashioned, damn-the-facts way. Its age is showing, more than most. ... Nonetheless, it's an important source, albeit more entertaining at this point than informative.\"\n\n"}

He was responsible at the UIA for the development of interlinked databases and for publications based on those databases, mainly the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential, the Yearbook of International Organizations, and the International Congress Calendar. Judge has also personally authored a collection of over 1,600 documents of relevance to governance and strategy-making. All these papers are freely available on his personal website \"Laetus in Praesens\". Now retired from the UIA, he is continuing his research within the context of an initiative called \"Union of Imaginable Associations\".\n\nAnthony John Nesbitt (Tony) Judge, an Australian national, was born in Port Said, Egypt, in 1940. His father was a pilot and officer in the Royal Air Force. He was brought up in what was Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), with some schooling in the United Kingdom and Australia. He did chemical engineering at Imperial College (London) and an MBA at the University of Cape Town. He worked at the Union of International Associations between 1961 and 1963, and from 1968 till 2007. He is still living in Belgium, his wife is German, and they have one son.\n\nAnthony Judge's work at the UIA, from the sixties until 2007, involved the adaptation of a wide range of emerging technologies to data management and knowledge management, such as in-house computers, computer typesetting, email, extension of email access to developing countries, metadata structure, collaborative editing, Machine translation, web technology, VRML, and inter-institutional data integration. A particular focus of his activities was on the possibilities of visualizing networks of organizations, world problems and other sets of data.\n\nHis work also involved the production of many research papers relevant to the strategic position of international organizations and the organized response to world problems. He wrote papers for instance on dialogue facilitation, transformative conferencing, information system design, relevance of metaphor for governance and communication, transdisciplinarity, and concepts of human development.\n\nUnder Judge's direction the UIA developed the most extensive databases on global civil society and its networks. Those databases contain entries on international nonprofit bodies (61,000+), biography profiles (24,000+), international meetings (240,000+, past and future), world problems (56,000+), global strategies (32,000+), concepts of human development (4,800+), human values (3,300+), and more. Additionally, the number of links between different entries in the databases reaches over 2,000,000. Publications based on those databases include the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential, the Yearbook of International Organizations, the International Congress Calendar, and many other.\n\nJudge carried out also consulting and related activities with such institutions as the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), UNESCO, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), UN University (Tokyo), and the Commonwealth Science Council. One of his continuing research interests has been innovation in international meeting processes, especially in conferences with special problems. He thus played advisory and facilitatory roles in several events such as Inter-Sectoral Dialogue (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), World Futures Studies Conference (Turku, 1993), and Parliament of the World's Religions (Chicago, 1993).\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential\", of which Anthony Judge has been the main architect, is a monumental work that came into being thanks to a partnership between the UIA and Mankind 2000. Initiated in 1972, that collaborative project gave rise to a succession of editions of the \"Encyclopedia\" in 1976, 1986, 1990, and 1995, while in 2000 a new edition was made available as a collection of online databases through the UIA website. In 2005, following disagreement over the partnership contract, and as Executive Secretary of Mankind 2000, Judge reframed the \"Encyclopedia\" as having been a strategic initiative of the Union of Intelligible Associations.\n\nRichard Slaughter, in a review article, praised in particular the \"Encyclopedia\" introductory and commentary texts (available online), which were mainly written by Judge himself. Slaughter emphasized that the significance of this work is not its size or the scope of its tens of thousands of references, impressive though these are. It is rather in the nature of what has been attempted. Those numerous accompanying texts, he said, are good enough to be published separately because they contain highly cogent observations on the \"global problematique\", commentaries on the work of numerous great thinkers from a wide variety of fields, and an impressive array of insights about the epistemology, symbolism, metaphysics, metaphors and linguistic representations of the subject.\n\nOver the years Judge has produced more than 1,600 papers on information, knowledge organization, and other topics of relevance to governance, policy and strategy-making. Most of these papers are freely available on his personal website \"Laetus in Praesens\" (translated from Latin: \"Joy in the Present\"), where they are listed by themes and dates. Many of them evolve around the quest to create a wiser and more functional world, especially in the perspective of learning from the relative lack of success of past initiatives in view of the dimensions and urgency of challenges. His work has a high level of novelty, for instance innovation in the use of metaphors, art, poetry, debate, data-visualization and system structures. The exploratory interdisciplinary methodology of futures studies, with which Judge has long been associated, also significantly gives form to his whole, unique, work.\n\nNow retired from the UIA, Anthony Judge is continuing to write within the context of an initiative called \"Union of Imaginable Associations\", and its associated projects.\n\n"}

{"id": "203437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203437", "title": "Battle of Cape Matapan", "text": "Battle of Cape Matapan\n\nThe Battle of Cape Matapan () was a Second World War naval engagement between British and Axis forces, fought from 27–29 March 1941. The cape is on the south-west coast of the Peloponnesian peninsula of Greece. Following the interception of Italian signals by the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, ships of the Royal Navy and Royal Australian Navy, under the command of Admiral Andrew Cunningham, intercepted and sank or severely damaged several ships of the Italian \"Regia Marina\" under Squadron-Vice-Admiral Angelo Iachino. The opening actions of the battle are also known in Italy as the Battle of Gaudo.\n\nIn late March 1941, as British ships of the Mediterranean Fleet covered troop movements to Greece, Mavis Batey, a cryptographer at Bletchley Park, made a breakthrough, reading the Italian naval Enigma for the first time. The first message, the cryptic \"Today’s the day minus three,\" was followed three days later by a second message reporting the sailing of an Italian battle fleet comprising one battleship, six heavy and two light cruisers, plus destroyers to attack the merchant convoys supplying British forces. As always with Enigma, the intelligence breakthrough was concealed from the Italians by ensuring there was a plausible reason for the Allies to have detected and intercepted their fleet. In this case, it was a carefully directed reconnaissance plane.\n\nAs a further deception, Admiral Cunningham made a surreptitious exit after dark from a golf club in Alexandria to avoid being seen boarding his flagship, the battleship . He had made a point of arriving at the club the same afternoon with his suitcase as if for an overnight stay, and spent time on the golf course within sight of the Japanese consul. An evening party on his flagship was advertised for that night but was never meant to take place.\n\nAt the same time, there was a failure of intelligence on the Axis side. The Italians had been wrongly informed by the Germans that the Mediterranean Fleet had only one operational battleship and no aircraft carriers. In fact the Royal Navy had three battleships, while the damaged British aircraft carrier \"Illustrious\" had been replaced by HMS \"Formidable\".\n\nThe Allied force was the British Mediterranean fleet, consisting of the aircraft carrier HMS \"Formidable\" and the battleships , , and \"Warspite\". The main fleet was accompanied by the 10th Destroyer Flotilla ( and , and , commanded by Commander \"Hec\" Waller, RAN), and the 14th Destroyer Flotilla (, , , and , commanded by Philip Mack); also present were and . Force B, under Admiral Sir Henry Pridham-Wippell, consisted of the British light cruisers , , and , the Australian light cruiser , and the British destroyers , , and . The Australian had returned to Alexandria. Allied warships attached to convoys were available: , , and waited in the Kithira Channel and , , , and and were nearby.\n\nThe Italian fleet was led by Iachino's flagship, the modern battleship , screened by destroyers \"Alpino\", \"Bersagliere\", \"Fuciliere\", and \"Granatiere\" of the 13th Flotilla. The fleet also included most of the Italian heavy cruiser force: , , and , accompanied by four destroyers (\"Alfredo Oriani\", , \"Vincenzo Gioberti\", and ) of the 9th Flotilla; and \"Trieste\", \"Trento\", and \"Bolzano\", accompanied by three destroyers (\"Ascari\", \"Corazziere\", and \"Carabiniere\") of the 12th Flotilla. Joining them were the light cruisers and (8th division) and two destroyers of the 16th Flotilla (\"Emanuele Pessagno\" and \"Nicoloso de Recco\") from Brindisi. Significantly, none of the Italian ships had radar, unlike several of the Allied ships.\n\nOn 27 March, Vice-Admiral Pridham-Wippell—with the cruisers \"Ajax\", \"Gloucester\", \"Orion\" and \"Perth\" and a number of destroyers—sailed from Greek waters for a position south of Crete. Admiral Cunningham with \"Formidable\", \"Warspite\", \"Barham\" and \"Valiant\" left Alexandria on the same day to meet the cruisers.\n\nThe Italian Fleet was spotted by a Sunderland flying boat at 12:00, depriving Iachino of any advantage of surprise. The Italian Admiral also learned that \"Formidable\" was at sea, thanks to the decryption team aboard \"Vittorio Veneto\". Nevertheless, after some discussion, the Italian headquarters decided to go ahead with the operation, to show the Germans their will to fight and confidence in the higher speed of their warships.\n\nOn 28 March, an IMAM Ro.43 floatplane launched by \"Vittorio Veneto\" spotted the British cruiser squadron at 06:35. At 07:55, the \"Trento\" group encountered Admiral Pridham-Wippell's cruiser group south of the Greek island of Gavdos. The British squadron was heading to the south-east. Thinking they were attempting to run from their larger ships, the Italians gave chase, opening fire at 08:12 from . The three heavy cruisers fired repeatedly until 08:55, with \"Trieste\" firing 132 armour piercing rounds, \"Trento\" firing 204 armour-piercing and 10 explosive shells and \"Bolzano\" firing another 189 armour piercing shells, but the Italians experienced trouble with their rangefinding equipment and scored no significant hits. HMS \"Gloucester\" fired three salvos in return. These fell short but did cause the Italians to make a course change.\n\nAs the distance had not been reduced after an hour of pursuit, the Italian cruisers broke off the chase, turning to the north-west on a course to rejoin \"Vittorio Veneto\". The Allied ships changed course in turn, following the Italian cruisers at extreme range. Iachino let them come on in hopes of luring the British cruisers into the range of \"Vittorio Veneto\"s guns.\n\nAn officer on \"Orion\"s bridge remarked to a companion, \"What's that battleship over there? I thought ours were miles away.\" The Italians eavesdropped on \"Orion\"s signal that she had sighted an unknown unit and was going to investigate. At 10:55, \"Vittorio Veneto\" joined the Italian cruisers and immediately opened fire on the shadowing Allied cruisers. She fired 94 rounds from a distance of , all well aimed but again with an excessive dispersal of her salvos. The Allied cruisers, until then unaware of the presence of a battleship, withdrew, suffering slight damage from shell splinters. A series of photographs taken from HMS \"Gloucester\" showing Italian salvos falling amongst Allied warships was published by \"Life\" magazine on 16 June 1941. \"Vittorio\" \"Veneto\" fired a total of 94 shells in 29 salvos. Another 11 rounds got jammed in the barrels.\n\nCunningham's force, which had been attempting to rendezvous with Pridham-Wippell, had launched an attack by Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers from HMS \"Formidable\" at 09:38. They attacked \"Vittorio Veneto\" without direct effect, but the required manoeuvring made it difficult for the Italian ships to maintain their pursuit. The Italian ships fired 152, 100 and 90 mm guns and also 37, 20 and 13.2 mm guns when at close range, repelling the attack, while one of the two Junkers Ju 88s escorting the Italian fleet was shot down by a Fairey Fulmar. Iachino broke off the pursuit at 12:20, retiring towards his own air cover at Taranto.\n\nA second aerial attack at 15:09 surprised the Italians; Lieutenant-Commander Dalyell-Stead was able to fly his Albacore to within of \"Vittorio Veneto\" before releasing a torpedo which hit her outer port propeller and caused of flooding. Dalyell-Stead and his crew were killed when their aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from the battleship. The ship stopped while the damage was repaired, but she was able to get under way again at 16:42, making . Cunningham heard of the damage to \"Vittorio Veneto\", and started a pursuit.\nA third attack by six Albacores and two Fairey Swordfish of 826 and 828 Naval Air Squadrons from \"Formidable\" and two Swordfish of 815 squadron from Crete took place between 19:36 and 19:50. Admiral Iachino deployed his ships in three columns and used smoke, searchlights, and a heavy barrage to protect the \"Vittorio Veneto\". The tactics prevented further damage to the battleship, but one torpedo hit the \"Pola\", which had nearly stopped to avoid running into the \"Fiume\" and could not take any evasive action. This blow knocked out five boilers and the main steam line, causing \"Pola\" to lose electric power and drift to a stop. The torpedo was apparently dropped by Lieutenant F.M.A. Torrens-Spence.\n\nUnaware of Cunningham's pursuit, a squadron of cruisers and destroyers was ordered to return and help \"Pola\". This squadron included \"Pola\"s sister ships, \"Zara\" and \"Fiume\". The squadron did not start to return towards \"Pola\" until about an hour after the order had been given by Iachino, officially due to communication problems, while \"Vittorio Veneto\" and the other ships continued to Taranto.\n\nAt 20:15, \"Orion\"s radar picked up a ship six miles to port, apparently dead in the water; she was the crippled \"Pola\". The bulk of the Allied forces detected the Italian squadron on radar shortly after 22:00, and were able to close without being detected. The Italian ships had no radar and could not detect British ships by means other than sight; Italian thinking did not envisage night actions and their main gun batteries were not prepared for action. At 22:20 they spotted the Allied squadron, but thought them to be Italian ships. The battleships \"Barham\", \"Valiant\", and \"Warspite\" were able to close to – point blank range for battleship guns – at which point they opened fire. The Allied searchlights (including those aboard \"Valiant\", under the command of a young Prince Philip) illuminated their enemy. Some British gunners witnessed cruiser main turrets flying dozens of metres into the air. After just three minutes, \"Fiume\" and \"Zara\" had been destroyed. \"Fiume\" sank at 23:30, while \"Zara\" was finished off by a torpedo from the destroyer HMS \"Jervis\" at 02:40 of 29 March.\n\nTwo Italian destroyers, and , were sunk in the first five minutes. The other two, \"Gioberti\" and \"Oriani\", managed to escape in a smoke screen, the former with heavy damage, after being chased and fired at by the British destroyers \"Griffin\" and \"Greyhound\". Towing \"Pola\" to Alexandria as a prize was considered, but daylight was approaching, and it was thought that the danger of enemy air attack was too high. British boarding parties seized a number of much-needed Breda anti-aircraft machine guns. \"Pola\"s crew was taken off and she was sunk by torpedoes from the destroyers \"Jervis\" and \"Nubian\" shortly after 04:00. The only known Italian reaction after the shocking surprise was a fruitless torpedo charge by \"Oriani\" and \"Gioberti\" and the aimless fire of one of \"Zara\"s 40 mm guns in the direction of the British warships.\n\nThe Allied ships took on survivors but left the scene in the morning, fearing Axis air strikes. Admiral Cunningham ordered a signal to be made on the Merchant Marine emergency band. This signal was received by the Italian High Command. It informed them that, due to the risk of air strikes, the Allied ships had ceased their rescue operations and granted safe passage to a hospital ship for rescue purposes. The location of the remaining survivors was broadcast, and the Italian hospital ship \"Gradisca\" came to recover them. Allied casualties during the battle were a single torpedo bomber shot down by \"Vittorio Veneto\"s 90 mm (3.5-inch) anti-aircraft batteries, with the loss of the three-man crew. Italian losses were up to 2,303 sailors, most of them from \"Zara\" and \"Fiume\". The Allies rescued 1,015 survivors, while the Italians saved another 160.\n\nMatapan was Italy's greatest defeat at sea, subtracting from its order of battle a cruiser division. The British in the Mediterranean lost the heavy cruiser and the new light cruiser \"Bonaventure\" in the same period (26–31 March 1941), but while the Royal Navy lost four heavy cruisers during the war (\"York\", \"Exeter\", \"Cornwall\" and \"Dorsetshire\"), at Matapan the Regia Marina lost three in a night. That the Italians had sortied so far to the east established a potential threat that forced the British to keep their battleships ready to face another sortie during the operations off Greece and Crete.\n\nAfter the defeat at Cape Matapan, the Italian Admiral Iachino wrote that the battle had\n\nThe Italian fleet did not venture into the Eastern Mediterranean again until the fall of Crete two months later. Despite his impressive victory, Admiral Cunningham was somewhat disappointed with the failure of the destroyers to make contact with \"Vittorio Veneto\". The escape of the Italian battleship was, in the words of the British Admiral, \"much to be regretted\".\n\nFor reasons of secrecy, code breakers at the GC&CS were rarely informed of the operational effects of their work, but their impact on the Battle of Cape Matapan was an exception. A few weeks after the end of the battle, Admiral Cunningham dropped into Bletchley Park to congratulate 'Dilly and his girls, with a positive impact on morale: Mavis Batey (née Lever), one of the code breakers remembers: \"Our sense of elation knew no bounds when Cunningham came down in person to congratulate us\". Admiral John Godfrey, the Director of Naval Intelligence, stated: \"Tell Dilly that we have won a great victory in the Mediterranean and it is entirely due to him and his girls\".\n\nThere is still controversy in Italy regarding the orders given by the Italian Admiral Angelo Iachino to the \"Zara\" division to recover the \"Pola\", when it was clear that an enemy battleship force was steaming from the opposite direction.\n\nFor decades after the end of the Second World War, the involvement of the GC&CS, as well as the code breaking methods used, were kept secret. A number of controversial theories were published before more complete accounts emerged after records were declassified in 1978. Only later, after Dilly's rodding method was demonstrated by Mavis Batey to the Admiral in charge of naval history, were Italian official records corrected. In 1966, H. Montgomery Hyde published a story alleging that a spy (codename Cynthia) seduced Admiral Alberto Lais (the Italian naval attaché in Washington, D.C.) and that she obtained a codebook used by the British to defeat the Italians at Matapan. Hyde was found guilty of libelling the dead, but evidence of GC&CS involvement was not made public at that time. In 1980, the BBC series \"Spy!\" included similar allegations about a spy called 'Cynthia' who obtained a codebook. In 1974, Frederick Winterbotham in \"The Ultra Secret\" falsely credited the decryption of \"Luftwaffe\" Enigma traffic.\n\n\nIncluded:\nForce A, 14th Destroyer Flotilla, 10th Destroyer Flotilla (of Force C), Force B, 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, Force D\n\n\n\n"}

It is a spin-off of Avery's previous creation, Droopy, and stars his unnamed Southern-accented wolf, who previously appeared opposite Droopy in \"The Three Little Pups\" and in \"Blackboard Jumble\" and \"Sheepwrecked.\" He would later serve as a basis for the character of McWolf, Droopy's archenemy in \"Droopy, Master Detective.\"\n\nThe Southern-accented Wolf is having breakfast on his farm when there is a knock on his door. A letter is pushed under it, which reads:\n\nTrue to the letter's contents, the wolf opens the door and finds a basket with a baby goat, Billy, who walks around inside the wolf's house, eating anything in its path, such as the carpet, part of the sofa, the wallpaper, the calendar, the globe, the curtains, and the wolf's trousers. The wolf, here presented with palilalia, addresses the audience: \"\"You know? Now there's a pretty hungry little billy goat-goat-goat-goat-goat-goat.\" Oblivious to Billy's limitless hunger, the wolf gives him a bottle of milk, but Billy spills the milk and eats the bottle, the pacifier, the cutlery and crockery (like a sandwich), the coffeepot (along with all the coffee inside it), and the napkin.\n\nRealizing that Billy will be more than a handful to deal with, the wolf tries to tie him in the garden to a hook hammered into the ground, but Billy eats the rope and comically eats the top part of the wolf's shoe when he tries to stop him. The wolf checks his foot and finds all \"ten\" of his toes still there, to his relief. Billy then tries to eat the wolf's spare tire, but is unable to chew the rubber and ends up shaped like the tire as soon as he swallows it whole.\n\nThe wolf then tries tying Billy to the windmill, but once again, Billy eats not only the rope, but the entire windmill, leaving the blades spinning at the top even with no support. He then attempts to take him away in a wheelbarrow and release him into the wild, but Billy eats the wheelbarrow \"and\" the wheel. The wolf ties Billy to a kite and releases him into the sky, but Billy eats the kite, the string and starts chewing on the wolf's arm. Unaffected, the wolf merely tells him to stop. He wraps Billy in chains and tries to tie him to a tree on a small island, but Billy proceeds to eat some of the film itself.\n\nNext, the wolf places Billy in the trunk of his car and tries to drive him somewhere, but Billy somehow eats his way through the car and ends up devouring the motor. The wolf then ties Billy to a horse and hits it on the bottom to make it run away and take Billy with it. However, Billy eats the horse's hair, and the angry horse repeats the same tactic with the wolf, whose hair Billy eats as well. The wolf looks irritably at the horse and says \"Copycat\".\n\nAs a final attempt to rid himself of Billy for good, the wolf places pepper on a railroad track and has Billy eat the railway, following it all the way to California, which is 2360 miles away. With Billy gone, the wolf tucks himself into bed. That night, Billy returns, eating the other side of the railway and covered in stamps of all the States he crossed eating the railway. The wolf suddenly awakens to see that Billy has eaten his entire house. Feigning joy, the wolf welcomes Billy back but ties him to a rocket, which the wolf sends to the moon. Even this isn't enough to satisfy the little goat, as Billy then eats the moon, taking the moonlight along with it and leaving the Earth in darkness.\n\nThe wolf lights a match and says \"Goodnight, y'all-y'all-y'all-y'all\"\" as the cartoon closes.\n\nThe recurring melody played by woodwinds and/or whistled from 2:21 onward is the Civil War tune \"Kingdom Coming\" or \"The Year of Jubilo\".\n\n"}

Moretti also played the central character.\n\nThe film consists of three autobiographical chapters (\"capitoli\") of an open diary—that of film director and film producer Nanni Moretti.\n\nThe first episode follows the director/protagonist riding a Vespa through the neighbourhoods of a summery and half-deserted Rome. Shots of landscape, architecture, and beautiful monuments accompany his thoughts, which range from critiques of Hollywood cinema (specifically the contemporary movie \"\"), to critiques of banalization of the Italian cinema, to a chance meeting with Jennifer Beals, to sociology and urbanism. The episode ends at Ostia, close to the place where Pier Paolo Pasolini was killed.\n\nThe second episode cuts to Moretti escaping from the frenzy of city life on a journey through the Aeolian Islands. Travelling by ferry, his first stop is Lipari where he visits his friend Gerardo (Renato Carpentieri), a scholar studying James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" who had moved to the island eleven years earlier. He retires to study on the lost island where he can't even receive the television signal. But he is unable to find the tranquillity he desires, due to the number of tourists. So Nanni, accompanied by Gerardo, moves to Salina Island. The two are welcomed by a couple, friends of Gerardo, who seem incapable of managing the education of an extremely over-indulged child. (Indeed, the entire island seems to be under the rule of children.) Gerardo lets himself be influenced by the boy, who spends hours in front of the television, and discovers soap opera. Gradually Gerardo becomes entirely dependent upon the genre. Nanni, now even more exasperated, decides to move, still accompanied by Gerardo, to the island of Stromboli, but even this choice proves unfortunate: the two now have to deal with a megalomaniac mayor who wants to involve them in the most odd projects. While visiting the volcano Gerardo becomes still more gripped by the \"soap operas\", to the point of asking American tourists what happens in the episodes of \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", which haven't been broadcast in Italy yet.\n\nDisgruntled by the latest failure Nanni decides to move on the island of Alicudi, the least civilized of all, lacking water and electricity. At last Nanni seems satisfied with the accommodation, but Gerardo is impelled to escape from the island as soon as he realizes he cannot follow his favourite soap opera there.\n\nThe final episode narrates the difficult diagnosis of a disease that affected Moretti in real life and has the symptoms of persistent itching and disturbing insomnia. Nanni goes through a load of doctors and specialists who, between superficiality and false knowledge, suggest the most bizarre diagnoses. His desperation is such that he also tries alternate treatments, like Acupuncture. After having tried them all, another doctor suggests an X-ray after noticing his developing cough. This X-ray reveals a mass on the lung which after a biopsy he is diagnosed as suffering from a malignant, but treatable lymphatic system tumour.\nThe illness symptoms, which Nanni found in a medical encyclopedia, are those he declared to the \"deaf\" doctors. The episode concludes with a bitter and sarcastic toast \"alla salute!\" (), accompanied by a glass of water.\n\nMoretti won the award for Best Director at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. The film was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics.\n\n\n"}

The series is set around the life of Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of Sûreté du Québec, the provincial police force for Quebec. Books in the series have been nominated and received numerous awards.\n\nThe first book in the series, \"Still Life\", was released in 2006 and won the New Blood Dagger award, Arthur Ellis Award, the Dilys Award, 2007 Anthony Award, and the Barry Award. All subsequent novels in the series have won major crime-writing awards in three countries. Many have also made the New York Times Best-Seller List, debuting as high as #1.\n\nThe Chief Inspector Armand Gamache book series is written by Louise Penny. Prior to writing full-time, she worked 20 years as a radio journalist and host for CBC Radio in Thunder Bay, Ontario and Winnipeg, Manitoba. Penny originally began writing a historical novel, but changed to mystery writing after finding trouble finishing. She entered the first book of the series, \"Still Life\", in the \"Debut Dagger\" competition in the United Kingdom, placing second out of 800 entries.\n\nThe series is based on the character of Chief Inspector Armand Gamache. The stories take place usually in the village of Three Pines, with Gamache investigating the murders of various people in each novel. The native French speaker Gamache speaks English with a British accent. In the first book \"Still Life\", he is said to have learned English while he was an undergraduate at Christ's College, Cambridge, where according to \"A Great Reckoning\" he read for a degree in History.\n\nThe books have been described as \"character-driven\" mysteries that explore the relationships between characters with each book in the series. Three Pines is a fictional location set in the province of Quebec, with Penny setting up the characters using the history of old Canada to show their personalities and backgrounds. In the series, a few of the plots are set outside of Three Pines.\n\nThe Chief Inspector Armand Gamache book series contains little or no sex or violence and has been referred to as a kinder and gentler alternative to modern crime fiction.\n\nThere are a total of 13 books in the series, all published by Minotaur Books, an imprint of St. Martin's Press. The first book was released in 2005, not in the U.S., with the most recent in 2017. There is also a short novella called \"The Hangman\" which features Insector Gamache and is set in Three Pines. This does not form part of the series and was written as a simple story for adults learning to read English.\n\nIn addition to numerous books making it to the New York Times Bestseller List, Penny has won multiple awards for the book series. She has won the Anthony and the Agatha Awards 5 times each and the Canadian Arthur Ellis Award twice. She was also a finalist for the Edgar Award for \"How The Light Gets In\". The books have also earned her numerous Macavity Awards, and been nominated for numerous others.\n\n"}

Microsoft first introduced an operating environment named Windows in November 1985 as an add-on to MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).\n\nAll versions of Microsoft Windows are commercial proprietary software.\n\nBasic general information about Windows.\n\nWindows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) is a variation of Microsoft's Windows operating system for minimalistic computers and embedded systems. Windows CE is a distinctly different kernel, rather than a trimmed-down version of desktop Windows. It is supported on Intel x86 and compatibles, MIPS, ARM, and Hitachi SuperH processors.\n\nWindows Mobile is Microsoft's discontinued line of operating systems for smartphones.\nWindows Phone is Microsoft's discontinued line of operating systems for smartphones.\n\nIt is possible to install the MS-DOS variants 7.0 and 7.1 without the graphics user interface of Windows. If an independent installation of both, DOS and Windows is desired, DOS ought to be installed prior to Windows, at the start of a small partition. The system must be transferred by the (dangerous) \"SYSTEM\" DOS-command, while the other files constituting DOS can simply be copied (the files located in the DOS-root and the entire COMMAND directory). Such a stand-alone installation of MS-DOS 8 is not possible, as it's designed to work as real mode for Windows Me and nothing else.\n\nThe Windows NT kernel powers all recent Windows operating systems. It runs on IA-32, x64 and Itanium processors.\nVarious versions of Windows support various file systems, including: FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, HPFS, or NTFS, along with network file systems shared from other computers, and the ISO 9660 and UDF file systems used for CDs, DVDs, and other optical discs such as Blu-ray. Each file system is usually limited in application to certain media, for example CDs must use ISO 9660 or UDF, and as of Windows Vista, NTFS is the only file system which the operating system can be installed on. Windows Embedded CE 6.0, Windows Vista Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2008 onwards support exFAT, a file system more suitable for USB flash drives.\n\nInstalling Windows requires an internal or external optical drive. A keyboard and mouse are the recommended input devices, though some versions support a touchscreen. For operating systems prior to Vista, the drive must be capable of reading CD media, while in Windows Vista onwards, the drive must be DVD-compatible. The drive may be detached after installing Windows.\n\nMaximum limits on physical memory (RAM) that Windows can address vary depending on both the Windows version and between IA-32 and x64 versions.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is useful for physicians, epidemiologists, global travelers, emergency volunteers and all who have dealt with or might have to deal with public health issues.\n\nThe title of the book, as registered in the Library of Congress, is \"Control of Communicable Diseases Manual 20th edition, An Official Report of the American Public Health Association.\" The editor of CCDM is David L. Heymann, MD.\nThe first edition, published in 1917 by the US Public Health Service, titled Control of Communicable Diseases. The first edition was a 30-page booklet with 38 diseases (Public Health Reports 32:41:1706-1733), adopted from a pamphlet written by Dr. Francis Curtis, health officer for Newton, Massachusetts, and sold for 5¢. Changes over the years reflect the new discoveries of infectious agents over the past century. The second edition in 1926 included 42 diseases, but only two arthropod (usually mosquito) - borne diseases, yellow and dengue fever and one protozoan disease, malaria. The causative organism of smallpox, dengue and chickenpox was listed as 'unknown.' The third edition in 1932 included two new arthropod infestations and a new disease, coccidioidal granuloma, with a note that it was 100% fatal. Eight diseases were listed as \"reportable\": diphtheria, epidemic influenza, measles, meningococcal meningitis, polio, scarlet fever, smallpox, and typhoid fever. The fourth edition in 1935 included 13 new infections. The fifth edition erroneously listed pemphigus as being infectious. In the sixth edition the rickettsioses were reorganized. In the seventh edition (1950) leprosy became Hansen's disease and cat-scratch disease was added as a probable viral disease (now known to be caused by the bacterium, Bartonella henselae. The eight edition (1955) erroneously listed actinomycosis as a fungal disease. In the ninth edition, arthropod-borne viral diseases were reclassified, with 49 additional diseases, resulting in substantially more viral entries. By the twelfth edition (1975) there were 118 arboviral illnesses. The 16th edition included \"neoplastic, malignant viral-associated diseases\" for the first time. In 2004 (18th edition) there were six \"tick-borne\" diseases, which was later corrected to include a \"mite-borne\" disease, rickettsialpox. The title was changed to \"Control of Communicable Disease Manual\" in 1995 (16th edition) to remove any perception of gender bias.\nFor a long time the paperback edition was a handy pocket book, the 17th edition still fitting in one hand or a pocket . Now, the softcover version can only fit in the largest pocket of a spacious winter coat. However, the entire contents are now available as an app for iOS and Android and in PDF format.\n\nThe paperback is 729 pages with dimensions of 1.5 x 4.2 x 7 inches. The ISBN is 978-0-87553-018-5.\n\nThe American Public Health Association published the 20th edition of the \"CCDM\" in 2014 under the editorship of David L. Heymann, MD. International infectious disease and public health experts, at both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, have updated this version.\n\nThe 20th edition includes two new chapters on noma and animal/human communicable diseases. New arboviral agents were added (Banna, Cache Valley, Iquitos, and the Me Tri virus, but the number of arboviruses and other pathogens also contracted, apparently to make the manual less encyclopedic. The previous edition had eleven new chapters on topics fundamental to a global public health landscape. Chapter topics include: risk management, public health security in a globalized world, international health regulations, reporting of communicable diseases, outbreak response in bioterrorism, communicable disease control in humanitarian emergencies and handling of infectious materials. Other new chapters offer guidance on disease control at mass gatherings, after natural disasters or in emergency situations.\n\n\"The Control of Communicable Diseases Manual\" (\"CCDM\") compiles comprehensive scientific data about communicable diseases, which significantly contribute to mortality and morbidity around the world. The \"CCDM\" emphasizes the epidemiological aspects of communicable diseases and provides information about their identification, reporting, control and prevention.\n\nThe \"CCDM\" lists diseases in alphabetical order and includes information on each disease using the following 12 sections:\n\n\nThe size of each section varies considerably. For instance, the occurrence section for smallpox is less than a line long, since this disease is officially present only in the freezers of laboratories at the CDC in the United States and the Vector Institute in Russia.\n\nThe book has been published in a number of languages, including Arabic, Catalan, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, and Thai, a testament to its global audience.\n\nThe \"CCDM\" is available as an online PDF version and as apps for iOS and Android for $50.\n\n"}

Jacobs claimed the brokerage in virtue of a custom or trade usage, whereby, if wool is removed from one broker to another by the owner, the first broker is entitled to a charge on the transfer equal to the amount of commission which would be earned on the price offered or reserved. It was shown that the custom had been observed in East London and other ports for many years, but that recently one broker had not made the charge for eighteen months. It was not shown, however, that plaintiff knew of the custom.\n\nThe court held, on appeal, that the law of South Africa is not less favourable to a person relying upon a trade usage than the law of England, there being no difference between the two systems on this point. The custom or trade usage in question was found to be certain and reasonable. In the circumstances, in sending his wool to be disposed of by Jacobs, Coutts must be taken to have bound himself to have entrusted the wool to be dealt with by Jacobs in accordance with the usage of brokers in East London. The court held, furthermore, that the fact that one broker in East London had not observed the custom did not destroy the custom's validity.\n\n\n\n"}

Central to the program's design is an outlining structure and the ability to easily manipulate information regardless of in which view it was entered. Multiple notepad, calendar, and phonebook views can be opened, and each item seen in each view can be a collapsible outline, with each line assignable to folders/categories which can themselves be their own views, text field, pulldown menu, calendar date (including repeating date), or phonebook entry.\n\nECCO Professional was introduced by Arabesque Software in 1993, as a Personal Information Manager (PIM) with a database backend. This version supports calendar and contact data, as well as to-do lists, and allows integration with other software via import and export capability, Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). A feature called \"Shooter\" puts a cut and paste tool at the top of the screen facilitating copy of data to and from ECCO. The user interface is based on a \"universal outliner\" and folders, which allow the user to build a variety of views organizing related information of mixed types. Data is stored as discrete objects, and can be dragged as dynamic links to multiple folders creating cross references. Ecco version 1.x supports shared folders and outlines for network access to data, but does not support windows workgroups. Ram based, the program was considered fast and relatively easy on laptop batteries, but a heavy consumer of system resources.\n\nECCO version 2.0, released in 1994, added support for workgroups, including group scheduling via email systems compliant with MAPI or VIM protocols, and Microsoft Schedule Plus, and sharing of contacts, calendars, and outlines, as well as file synchronization and reconciliation via intranet connections or email. In 1995 PC Magazine praised ECCO as a workgroup tool for scheduling and task management and noted its ability to handle free form data, but considered version 2.0 a \"poor choice as a contact manager\" which requires customization to match features of contemporary products, and lacks structured and complex search queries, good reporting, logging and correspondence functions.\n\nECCO version 3.0 was released in the summer of 1995 with an updated user interface based on a ring binder. Other additions include an Internet launch tool equipped with an address book containing links to over 2,000 sites. Internet support for the Shooter tool allows the user to push a URL and title for a web page back to ECCO. Searching improved with a query tool based on forms and support for boolean filters.\n\nECCO Pro version 4.0 added 32 bit support and OLE 2.0. as well as integration with NetManage's Chameleon and Z-Mail. Version 4.01 has support for Palm Pilot.\n\nEcco Pro was originally developed by Pete Polash, who had sold an early Macintosh based presentation program to Aldus and Bob Perez, a Harvard-trained lawyer hired by Apple as a programmer and Evangelist in the 1980s. It was first released in 1993 by Arabesque Software, Inc., based in Bellevue, Washington. PC Magazine awarded ECCO Pro their Editor’s Choice award in 1996 and 1997\n\nDevelopment by NetManage ceased in 1997 after the July 1997 release of version 4.01. Andrew Brown wrote in The Guardian:\n\"So what happened to the paragon of a program? The market killed it. First it was sold to a much larger company, Netmanage; presumably doing this made the original programmers a lot of money. Then Netmanage panicked when Microsoft Outlook came along as a \"free\" part of the Office suite, and killed development on the program.\" NetManage chief executive officer Zvi Alon noted that 'As soon as Microsoft decided to give away Outlook with Office, we started getting phone calls questioning the value of Ecco Pro'.\n\nEven though the source code for Ecco Pro is not open source, development of plugin extensions to the software continues. According to Scott Rosenberg, a programmer using the handle \"slangmgh\" developed an extension to Ecco Pro posted to ecco_pro users group on Yahoo which includes fixes and upgrades to the program, and may incorporate the Lua scripting language.\nThe EccoPro to Android Synchronization Software MyPhoneExplorer able to synchronize Contacts, Calendar, Tasks and Ecco Outlines to Android Phones and Tablets was released on July 9, 2013.\n\n"}

An important educator during the modernization of Japan during the Meiji Era, Fenollosa was an enthusiastic Orientalist who did much to preserve traditional Japanese art.\n\nFenollosa was the son of Manuel Francisco Ciriaco Fenollosa, a Spanish pianist, and Mary Silsbee and attended Hacker Grammar School in Salem, Massachusetts, and the Salem High School before going on to study philosophy and sociology at Harvard College, where he graduated in 1874. After a year at the art school of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, during which time he married Elizabeth Goodhue Millett, he traveled to Japan in 1878 at the invitation of American zoologist and Orientalist Edward S. Morse to teach political economy and philosophy at the Imperial University at Tokyo. There he studied ancient temples, shrines and art treasures with his assistant, Okakura Kakuzō.\n\nDuring his time in Japan, Fenollosa helped create the \"nihonga\" (Japanese) style of painting with Japanese artists Kanō Hōgai (1828–1888) and Hashimoto Gahō (1835–1908). In May 1882 he delivered a lecture on \"An Explanation of the Truth of Art\", which was widely circulated and quoted.\n\nAfter eight years at the University, he helped found the Tokyo School of Fine Arts and the Tokyo Imperial Museum, and subsequently acted as its director in 1888. In this period, he helped to draft the text of a law for the preservation of temples and shrines and their art treasures.\n\nFenollosa converted to Buddhism and was given the name Teishin. He was also granted the name Kano Eitan Masanobu, placing him in the lineage of the Kanō school, who had served as painters to the Tokugawa shoguns. While resident in Japan, Fenollosa's accomplishments included the first inventory of Japan's national treasures, leading to the discovery of ancient Chinese scrolls brought to Japan by traveling monks centuries earlier, and rescuing many Buddhist artifacts which would otherwise have been destroyed under the Haibutsu kishaku movement. For these achievements, the Emperor Meiji of Japan decorated him with the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Sacred Treasures.\n\nFenollosa was able to amass a large collection of Japanese art during his stay in Japan. In 1886, he sold his art collection to Boston physician Charles Goddard Weld (1857–1911) on the condition that it go to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and in 1890 he returned to Boston to serve as curator of the department of Oriental Art. There Fenollosa was asked to choose Japanese art for display at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He also organized Boston's first exhibition of Chinese painting in 1894. In 1896, he published \"Masters of Ukiyoe\", a historical account of Japanese paintings and ukiyo-e prints exhibited at the New York Fine Arts Building. However, his public divorce and immediate remarriage in 1895 to the writer Mary McNeill Scott (1865–1954) outraged Boston society, leading to his dismissal from the Museum in 1896.\n\nHe returned to Japan in 1897 to accept a position as Professor of English Literature at the Tokyo Higher Normal School at Tokyo. Lafcadio Hearn considered Fenollosa a friend; and Hearn almost believed that he visited the professor's home too often.\n\nIn 1900, he returned to the United States to write and lecture on Asia. His 1912 work in two volumes concentrates on art before 1800 but offers Hokusai's prints as a window of beauty after Japanese art had become too modern for Fenollosa's taste: \"Hokusai is a great designer, as Kipling and Whitman are great poets. He has been called the Dickens of Japan.\" Arthur Wesley Dow said of Fenollosa 'he was gifted with a brilliant mind of great analytical power, this with a rare appreciation gave him an insight into the nature of fine art such as few ever attain'\n\nAfter his death in London in 1908, Fenollosa's unpublished notes on Chinese poetry and Japanese Noh drama were confided by his widow to noted poet Ezra Pound who, with William Butler Yeats, used them to solidify the growing interest in Far Eastern literature among modernist writers. Pound subsequently finished Fenollosa's work with the aid of Arthur Waley, the noted British sinologist.\n\nFenollosa's body was cremated in London, and his ashes returned to the Hōmyō-in chapel of Mii-dera high above Lake Biwa, (where he had been tonsured) for burial. His tombstone was paid for by the Tokyo School of Fine Arts.\n\nAt a Harvard lecture of 2011, Benjamin Elman refers to the \"Epochs of the Chinese and Japanese Art\" (1912) where Fenollosa compares \"degeneration\" of the late imperial Chinese art to that which befell the high antique art of Europe in Byzantium (\"the poorest of the Byzantine mosaics\"; \"the only hope for the hopeless is to perceive itself to be hopeless\"). According to Elman, Fenollosa's perception was influenced by the political and military defeats of the Qing empire.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Mr. Rockefeller then claimed a $63,275 deduction on his 1974 income tax return, which was the amount of his salary as vice-president.\n\nThe 2nd Circuit affirmed the Tax Courts ruling that the deductions were not allowed under IRC section 162. The Court essentially compared Rockefeller’s past job as Governor of New York with his position as Vice President and found that the two positions did not constitute the same trade or business. Mr. Rockefeller’s estate argued that his trade or business was that of public service, but there was no authority that supported such a broad interpretation. Thus, the legal and consulting fees were not incurred in carrying out a trade or business, but in anticipation of doing so.

{"id": "410988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=410988", "title": "Golden plates", "text": "Golden plates\n\nAccording to Latter Day Saint belief, the golden plates (also called the gold plates or in some 19th-century literature, the golden bible) are the source from which Joseph Smith claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon, a sacred text of the faith. Some witnesses described the plates as weighing from , golden in color, and composed of thin metallic pages engraved on both sides and bound with three D-shaped rings.\n\nSmith said that he found the plates on September 22, 1823 on a hill, near his home in Manchester, New York, after the angel Moroni directed him to a buried stone box. He said that the angel prevented him from taking the plates but instructed him to return to the same location in a year. He returned to that site every year, but it was not until September 1827 that he recovered the plates on his fourth annual attempt to retrieve them. He returned home with a heavy object wrapped in a frock, which he then put in a box. He allowed others to heft the box but said that the angel had forbidden him to show the plates to anyone until they had been translated from their original \"reformed Egyptian\" language. Smith dictated the text of the Book of Mormon over the next several years, claiming that it was a translation of the plates. He did so by using a seer stone which he placed in the bottom of a hat and then placed the hat over his face to view the words written within the stone. Smith published the translation in 1830 as the Book of Mormon.\n\nSmith eventually obtained testimonies from 11 men who said that they had seen the plates, known as the Book of Mormon witnesses. After the translation was complete, Smith said that he returned the plates to the angel Moroni, so they could never be examined. Latter Day Saints believe the account of the golden plates as a matter of faith, and critics often assert that either Smith manufactured them himself or that the Book of Mormon witnesses based their testimony on visions rather than physical experience.\n\nIn the words of Mormon historian Richard Bushman, \"For most modern readers, the plates are beyond belief, a phantasm, yet the Mormon sources accept them as fact.\" Smith said that he returned the plates to the angel Moroni after he finished translating them, and their authenticity cannot be determined by physical examination. They were reportedly shown to several close associates of Smith. Mormon scholars have formed collaborations such as Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies to provide apologetic answers to critical research about the golden plates and topics in the field of Mormon studies. The credibility of the plates has been a \"troublesome item\", according to Bushman.\n\nThe Book of Mormon itself portrays the golden plates as a historical record, engraved by two pre-Columbian prophet-historians from around the year AD 400: Mormon and his son Moroni. Mormon and Moroni, the book says, had abridged earlier historical records from other sets of metal plates. Their script, according to the book, was described as \"reformed Egyptian\", a language unknown to linguists or Egyptologists. Scholarly reference works on languages do not acknowledge the existence of either a \"reformed Egyptian\" language or \"reformed Egyptian\" script as it has been described in Mormon belief, and there is no archaeological, linguistic, or other evidence of the use of Egyptian writing in ancient America. Historically, Latter Day Saint movement denominations have taught that the Book of Mormon's description of the plates' origin is accurate, and that the Book of Mormon is a translation of the plates. The Community of Christ, however, accepts the Book of Mormon as scripture but no longer takes an official position on the historicity of the golden plates. Some adherents accept the Book of Mormon as inspired scripture but do not believe that it is a literal translation of a physical historical record, even in the more theologically conservative Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).\n\nNon-believers and some liberal Mormons have advanced naturalistic explanations for the story of the plates. For example, it has been theorized that the plates were fashioned by Smith or one of his associates, that Smith had the ability to convince others of their existence through illusions or hypnosis, or that witnesses were having ecstatic visions.\n\nThe story of the golden plates consists of how, according to Joseph Smith and his contemporaries, the plates were found, received from the angel Moroni, translated, and returned to the angel before the publication of the Book of Mormon. Smith is the only source for a great deal of the story because much of it occurred while he was the only human witness. Nevertheless, Smith told the story to his family, friends, and acquaintances, and many of them provided second-hand accounts. Other parts of the story are derived from the statements of those who knew Smith, including several witnesses who said that they saw the golden plates.\n\nThe best-known elements of the golden plates story are found in an account told by Smith in 1838 and incorporated into the official church histories of some Latter Day Saint movement denominations. The LDS Church has canonized part of this 1838 account as part of its scripture, the Pearl of Great Price.\n\nDuring the Second Great Awakening, Joseph Smith lived on his parents' farm near Palmyra, New York. At the time, churches in the region contended so vigorously for souls that western New York later became known as the \"burned-over district\" because the fires of religious revivals had burned over it so often. Western New York was also noted for its participation in a \"craze for treasure hunting\". Beginning as a youth in the early 1820s, Smith was periodically hired, for about $14 per month, as a scryer, using what were termed \"seer stones\" in attempts to locate lost items and buried treasure. Smith's contemporaries described his method for seeking treasure as putting the stone in a white stovepipe hat, putting his face over the hat to block the light, and then \"seeing\" the information in the reflections of the stone.\n\nSmith did not consider himself to be a \"peeper\" or \"glass-looker\", a practice he called \"nonsense\". Rather, Smith and his family viewed their folk magical practices as spiritual gifts. Although Smith later rejected his youthful treasure-hunting activities as frivolous and immaterial, he never repudiated the stones themselves, denied their presumed power to find treasure, or ever relinquish the magic culture in which he was raised. He came to view seeing with a stone in religious terms as the work of a \"seer\". Smith's first stone, apparently the same one that he used at least part of the time to translate the golden plates, was chocolate-colored and about the size of a chicken egg, found in a deep well he helped dig for one of his neighbors. The LDS Church released photographs of the stone on August 4, 2015.\n\nAccording to Smith, he found the plates after he was directed to them by a heavenly messenger whom he later identified as the angel Moroni. According to the story, the angel first visited Smith's bedroom late at night, on September 22 in 1822 or 1823. Moroni told Smith that the plates could be found buried in a prominent hill near his home, later called \"Cumorah\", a name found in the Book of Mormon. Before dawn, Moroni reappeared two more times and repeated the information.\nHowever, the angel would not allow Smith to take the plates until he obeyed certain \"commandments\". Smith recorded some of these commandments but made it clear the main thrust of Moroni's message was that he had to keep God's commandments in general. Some contemporaries who later claimed he told them the story said there were others, some of which are relevant to the modern debate about whether or how closely events of early Mormonism were related to the practice of contemporary folk magic. Smith's writings say that the angel required at least the following: (1) that he have no thought of using the plates for monetary gain, (2) that he tell his father about the vision, and (3) that he never show the plates to any unauthorized person. Smith's contemporaries who claimed to have heard the story, both sympathetic and unsympathetic, generally agreed that Smith mentioned the following additional commandments: (4) that Smith take the plates and leave the site in which they had been buried without looking back, and (5) that the plates never directly touch the ground until they were safe at home in a locked chest. Some unsympathetic listeners who allegedly heard the story from Smith or his father recalled that Smith had said the angel required him (6) to wear \"black clothes\" to the place where the plates were buried, (7) to ride a \"black horse with a switchtail\", (8) to call for the plates by a certain name, and (9) to \"give thanks to God.\"\n\nIn the morning, Smith began work as usual and did not mention the visions to his father because, he said, he did not think his father would believe him. Smith said he then fainted because he had been awake all night, and while unconscious, the angel appeared a fourth time and chastised him for failing to tell the visions to his father. When Smith then told all to his father, he believed his son and encouraged him to obey the angel's commands. Smith then set off to visit the hill, later stating that he used his seer stone to locate the place that the plates were buried but that he \"knew the place the instant that [he] arrived there.\"\n\nSmith said he saw a large stone covering a box made of stone (or possibly iron). Using a stick to remove dirt from the edges of the stone cover and prying it up with a lever, Smith saw the plates inside the box, together with other artifacts.\n\nAccording to Smith's followers, Smith said he took the plates from the box, put them on the ground, and covered the box with the stone to protect the other treasures that it contained. Nevertheless, the accounts say that when Smith looked back at the ground after closing the box, the plates had once again disappeared into it. When Smith once again raised the stone and attempted to retrieve the plates, he said that he was stricken by a supernatural force that hurled him to the ground as many as three times.\n\nDisconcerted by his inability to obtain the plates, Smith said he briefly wondered whether his experience had been a \"dreem of Vision\" [sic]. Concluding that it was not, he said he prayed to ask why he had been barred from taking the plates.\n\nIn response to his question, Smith said the angel appeared and told him he could not receive the plates because he \"had been tempted of the advisary and saught the Plates to obtain riches and kept not the commandments that I should have an eye single to the Glory of God\" [sic]. According to Smith's followers, Smith had also broken the angel's commandment \"not to lay the plates down, or put them for a moment out of his hands,\" and according to a nonbeliever, Smith said, \"I had forgotten to give thanks to God,\" as required by the angel.\n\nSmith said the angel instructed him to return the next year, on September 22, 1824, with the \"right person\": his older brother Alvin. Alvin died in November 1823, and Smith returned to the hill in 1824 to ask what he should do. Smith said he was told to return the following year (1825) with the \"right person\" but the angel did not tell Smith who that person might be. However, Smith determined after looking into his seer stone that the \"right person\" was Emma Hale, his future wife. For the visit on September 22, 1825, Smith may have attempted to bring his treasure-hunting associate Samuel T. Lawrence.\n\nSmith said that he visited the hill \"at the end of each year\" for four years after the first visit in 1823, but there is no record of him being in the vicinity of Palmyra between January 1826 and January 1827, when he returned to New York from Pennsylvania with his new wife. In January 1827, Smith visited the hill and then told his parents that the angel had severely chastised him for not being \"engaged enough in the work of the Lord,\" which may have meant that he had missed his annual visit to the hill in 1826.\n\nThe next annual visit on September 22, 1827 would be, Smith told associates, his last chance to receive the plates. According to Brigham Young, as the scheduled final date to obtain the plates approached, several Palmyra residents expressed concern \"that they were going to lose that treasure\" and sent for a skilled necromancer from 60 miles (96 km) away, encouraging him to make three separate trips to Palmyra to find the plates. During one of the trips, the unnamed necromancer is said to have discovered the location but was unable to determine the value of the plates. A few days prior to the September 22, 1827 visit to the hill, Smith's loyal treasure-hunting friends Josiah Stowell and Joseph Knight, Sr. traveled to Palmyra, in part, to be there during Smith's scheduled visit to the hill.\n\nAnother of Smith's former treasure-hunting associates, Samuel T. Lawrence, was also apparently aware of the approaching date to obtain the plates, and Smith was concerned that he might cause trouble. Therefore, on the eve of September 22, 1827, the scheduled date for retrieving the plates, Smith dispatched his father to spy on Lawrence's house until dark. If Lawrence attempted to leave, the elder Smith was to tell him that his son would \"thrash the stumps with him\" if he found him at the hill. Late at night, Smith took a horse and carriage to the hill Cumorah with Emma. While Emma stayed behind kneeling in prayer, Smith walked to the site of the buried plates. Some time in the early morning hours, he said that he retrieved the plates and hid them in a hollow log on or near Cumorah. At the same time, Smith said he received a pair of large spectacles he called the Urim and Thummim or \"Interpreters,\" with lenses consisting of two seer stones, which he showed his mother when he returned in the morning.\n\nOver the next few days, Smith took a well-digging job in nearby Macedon to earn enough money to buy a solid lockable chest in which to put the plates. By then, however, some of Smith's treasure-seeking company had heard that Smith had said that he had been successful in obtaining the plates, and they wanted what they believed was their share of the profits from what they viewed as part of a joint venture in treasure hunting. Spying once again on the house of Samuel Lawrence, Smith, Sr., determined that a group of ten to twelve of these men, including Lawrence and Willard Chase, had enlisted the talents of a renowned and supposedly talented seer from 60 miles (96 km) away, in an effort to locate where the plates were hidden by means of divination. When Emma heard of that, she rode a stray horse to Macedon and informed Smith, who reportedly determined through his Urim and Thummim that the plates were safe. He nevertheless hurriedly rode home with Emma.\n\nOnce home in Manchester, he said he walked to Cumorah, removed the plates from their hiding place, and walked home through the woods and away from the road with the plates wrapped in a linen frock under his arm. On the way, he said a man had sprung up from behind a log and struck him a \"heavy blow with a gun... Knocking the man down with a single punch, Joseph ran as fast as he could for about a half mile before he was attacked by a second man trying to get the plates. After similarly overpowering the man, Joseph continued to run, but before he reached the house, a third man hit him with a gun. In striking the last man, Joseph said, he injured his thumb.\" He returned home with a dislocated thumb and other minor injuries. Smith sent his father, Joseph Knight, and Josiah Stowell to search for the pursuers, but they found no one.\n\nSmith is said to have put the plates in a locked chest and hid them in his parents' home in Manchester. He refused to allow anyone, including his family, to view the plates or the other artifacts that he said he had in his possession, but some people were allowed to heft them or feel what were said to be the artifacts through a cloth. A few days after retrieving the plates, Smith brought home what he said was an ancient breastplate, which he said had been hidden in the box at Cumorah with the plates. After letting his mother feel through a thin cloth what she said was the breastplate, he placed it in the locked chest.\n\nThe Smith home was approached \"nearly every night\" by villagers hoping to find the chest, where Smith said the plates were kept. After hearing that a group of them would attempt to enter the house by force, Smith buried the chest under the hearth, and the family was able to scare away the intended intruders. Fearing the chest might still be discovered, Smith hid it under the floor boards of his parents' old log home nearby that was then being used as a cooper shop. Later, Smith told his mother he had taken the plates out of the chest, left the empty chest under the floor boards of the cooper shop, and hid the plates in a barrel of flax. Shortly thereafter the empty box was discovered and the place ransacked by Smith's former treasure-seeking associates, who had enlisted one of the men's sisters to find the hiding place by looking in her seer stone.\n\nSmith said that the plates were engraved in an unknown language, and he told associates that he was capable of reading and translating them. The translation took place mainly in Harmony, Pennsylvania (now Oakland Township), Emma's hometown, where Smith and his wife had moved in October 1827 with financial assistance from a prominent, though superstitious, Palmyra landowner Martin Harris. The translation occurred in two phases: the first, from December 1827 to June 1828, during which Smith transcribed some of the characters and then dictated 116 manuscript pages to Harris, which were lost. The second phase began sporadically in early 1829 and then in earnest in April 1829 with the arrival of Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher who volunteered to serve as Smith's full-time scribe. In June 1829, Smith and Cowdery moved to Fayette, New York, completing the translation early the following month.\nSmith used scribes to write the words he said were a translation of the golden plates, dictating the words while peering into seer stones, which he said allowed him to see the translation. Smith's translation process evolved from of his previous use of seer stones in treasure-seeking. During the earliest phase of translation, Smith said he used what he called Urim and Thummim, two stones set in a frame like a set of large spectacles. Witnesses said Smith placed the Urim and Thummim in his hat while he was translating.\n\nAfter the loss of the first 116 manuscript pages, Smith translated with a single seer stone, which some sources say he had previously used in treasure-seeking. Smith placed the stone in a hat, buried his face in it to eliminate all outside light, and peered into the stone to see the words of the translation. A few times during the translation, a curtain or blanket was raised between Smith and his scribe or between the living area and the area where Smith and his scribe worked. Sometimes, Smith dictated to Harris from upstairs or from a different room.\n\nSmith's translation did not require the use of the plates themselves. Though Smith himself said very little about the translation process, his friends and family said that as he looked into the stone, the written translation of the ancient script appeared to him in English. There are several proposed explanations for how Smith composed his translation. In the 19th century, the most common explanation was that he copied the work from a manuscript written by Solomon Spaulding. That theory is repudiated by Smith's preeminent modern biographers. The most prominent modern theory is that Smith composed the translation in response to the provincial opinions of his time, perhaps while in a magical trance-like state. As a matter of faith, Latter Day Saints generally view the translation process as either an automatic process of transcribing text written within the stone or an intuitive translation by Smith, assisted by a mystical connection with God, through the stone.\n\nSmith's dictations were written down by a number of assistants, including Emma Smith, Martin Harris, and Oliver Cowdery. In May 1829, after Smith had lent 116 unduplicated manuscript pages to Harris, and Harris had lost them, Smith dictated a revelation explaining that Smith could not simply retranslate the lost pages because his opponents would attempt to see if he could \"bring forth the same words again.\" According to Grant Palmer, Smith believed \"a second transcription would be identical to the first. This confirms the view that the English text existed in some kind of unalterable, spiritual form rather than that someone had to think through difficult conceptual issues and idioms, always resulting in variants in any translation.\"\n\nWhen Smith and Emma moved to Pennsylvania in October 1827, they transported a wooden box, which Smith said contained the plates, hidden in a barrel of beans. For a time, the couple stayed in the home of Emma's father, Isaac Hale, but when Smith refused to show Hale the plates, Hale banished the concealed objects from his house. Afterward, Smith told several of his associates that the plates were hidden in the nearby woods. Emma said that she remembered the plates being on a table in the house, wrapped in a linen tablecloth, which she moved from time to time when it got in the way of her chores. According to Smith's mother, the plates were also stored in a trunk on Emma's bureau. However, Smith did not require the physical presence of the plates to translate them.\n\nIn April 1828, Martin Harris's wife, Lucy, visited Harmony with her husband and demanded to see the plates. When Smith refused to show them to her, she searched the house, grounds, and woods. According to Smith's mother, during the search Lucy was frightened by a large, black snake and so was prevented from digging up the plates. As a result of Martin Harris's loss of the 116 pages of manuscript, Smith said that between July and September 1828, the angel Moroni took back both the plates and the Urim and Thummim as a penalty for his having delivered \"the manuscript into the hands of a wicked man.\" According to Smith's mother, the angel returned the objects to Smith on September 22, 1828, the anniversary of the day that he first received them.\n\nIn March 1829, Martin Harris visited Harmony and asked to see the plates. Smith told him that he \"would go into the woods where the Book of Plates was, and that after he came back, Harris should follow his tracks in the snow, and find the Book, and examine it for himself.\" Harris followed the directions but could not find the plates.\n\nIn early June 1829, the unwanted attentions of locals around Harmony necessitated Smith's move to the home of David Whitmer and his parents in Fayette, New York. Smith said that during this move the plates were transported by the angel Moroni, who put them in the garden of the Whitmer house, where Smith could recover them. The translation was completed at the Whitmer home.\n\nAfter translation was complete, Smith said he returned the plates to the angel, but he did not elaborate about this experience. According to accounts by several early Mormons, a group of Mormon leaders, including Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and possibly others accompanied Smith and returned the plates to a cave inside the Hill Cumorah. There, Smith is said to have placed the plates on a table near \"many wagon loads\" of other ancient records, and the Sword of Laban hanging on the cave wall. According to Brigham Young's understanding, which he said that he had gained from Cowdery, on a later visit to the cave, the Sword of Laban was said to be unsheathed and placed over the plates and inscribed with the words: \"This sword will never be sheathed again until the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our God and his Christ.\"\n\nSmith taught that part of the golden plates were \"sealed.\" The \"sealed\" portion is said to contain \"a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.\" Many Latter Day Saints believe that the plates will be kept hidden until a future time, when the sealed part will be translated and, according to one early Mormon leader, transferred from the hill to one of the Mormon temples.\n\nDavid Whitmer is quoted as stating that he saw just the \"untranslated\" portion of the plates sitting on the table with the sword (and also a breastplate). Apparently, Whitmer was aware of expeditions at Cumorah to locate the sealed portion of the plates through \"science and mineral rods,\" which, he said, \"testify that they are there.\"\n\nSmith said the angel Moroni had commanded him not to show the plates to any unauthorized person. However, Smith eventually obtained the written statement of several witnesses who saw the plates. It is unclear whether the witnesses believed they had seen the plates with their physical eyes or had seen them in a vision. For instance, although Martin Harris continued to testify to the truth of the Book of Mormon even when he was estranged from the church, at least during the early years of the movement, he \"seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience.\"\n\nAccording to some sources, Smith initially intended that the first authorized witness be his firstborn son; but this child was stillborn in 1828. In March 1829, Martin Harris came to Harmony to see the plates, but was unable to find them in the woods where Smith said they could be found. The next day, Smith dictated a revelation stating that Harris could eventually qualify himself to be one of three witnesses with the exclusive right to \"view [the plates] as they are\".\n\nBy June 1829, Smith determined that there would be eight additional witnesses, a total of twelve including Smith. During the second half of June 1829, Smith took Harris, Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer (known collectively as the Three Witnesses) into woods in Fayette, New York, where they said they saw an angel holding the golden plates and turning the leaves. The four also said they heard \"the voice of the Lord\" telling them that the translation of the plates was correct, and commanding them to testify of what they saw and heard. A few days later, Smith took a different group of Eight Witnesses to a location near Smith's parents' home in Palmyra where they said Smith showed them the golden plates. Statements over the names of these men, apparently drafted by Smith, were published in 1830 as an appendix to the Book of Mormon. According to later statements ascribed to Martin Harris, he viewed the plates in a vision and not with his \"natural eyes.\"\n\nIn addition to Smith and the other eleven who claimed to be witnesses, a few other early Mormons said they saw the plates. For instance, Smith's mother Lucy Mack Smith said she had \"seen and handled\" the plates. Smith's wife Emma and his younger brother William and younger sister Katharine also said they had examined and lifted the plates while they were wrapped in fabric. Others said they had visions of the plates or had been shown the plates by an angel, in some cases years after Smith said he had returned the plates.\n\nThe plates were said to be bound at one edge by a set of rings. In 1828, Martin Harris, is reported to have said that the plates were \"fastened together in the shape of a book by wires\". In 1859 Harris said that the plates \"were seven inches [18 cm] wide by eight inches [20 cm] in length, and were of the thickness of plates of tin; and when piled one above the other, they were altogether about four inches [10 cm] thick; and they were put together on the back by three silver rings, so that they would open like a book\". David Whitmer, another of the Three Witnesses, was quoted by an 1831 Palmyra newspaper as having said the plates were \"the thickness of tin plate; the back was secured with three small rings ... passing through each leaf in succession\". Anomalously, Smith's father is quoted as saying that the plates were only half an inch (1.27 centimeter) thick. Smith's mother, who said she had \"seen and handled\" the plates, is quoted as saying they were \"eight inches [20 cm] long, and six [15 cm] wide ... all connected by a ring which passes through a hole at the end of each plate\".\n\nHyrum Smith and John Whitmer, also witnesses in 1829, are reported to have stated that the rings holding the plates together were, in Hyrum's words, \"in the shape of the letter D, which facilitated the opening and shutting of the book\". Smith's wife Emma and his younger brother William said they had examined the plates while wrapped in fabric. Emma said she \"felt of the plates, as they thus lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb, as one does sometimes thumb the edges of a book\". William agreed that the plates could be rustled with one's thumb like the pages of a book.\n\nSmith did not provide his own published description of the plates until 1842, when he said in a letter that \"each plate was six inches [15 cm] wide and eight inches [20 cm] long, and not quite so thick as common tin. They were ... bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the whole. The volume was something near six inches [15 cm] in thickness\".\n\nThe plates were first described as \"gold\", and beginning about 1827, the plates were widely called the \"gold bible\". When the Book of Mormon was published in 1830, the Eight Witnesses described the plates as having \"the appearance of gold\". The Book of Mormon describes the plates as being made of \"ore\". In 1831, a Palmyra newspaper quoted David Whitmer, one of the Three Witnesses, as having said that the plates were a \"\"whitish yellow\" color\", with \"three small rings of the same metal\".\n\nSmith's first published description of the plates said that the plates \"had the appearance of gold\", and Smith said that Moroni had referred to the plates as \"gold.\" Late in life, Martin Harris stated that the rings holding the plates together were made of silver, and he said the plates themselves, based on their heft of \"forty or fifty pounds\" (18–23 kg), \"were lead or gold\". Joseph's brother William, who said he felt the plates inside a pillow case in 1827, said in 1884 that he understood the plates to be \"a mixture of gold and copper ... much heavier than stone, and very much heavier than wood\".\n\nDifferent people estimated the weight of the plates differently. According to Smith's one-time-friend Willard Chase, Smith told him in 1827 that the plates weighed between 40 and 60 pounds (18–27 kg), most likely the latter. Smith's father Joseph Smith, Sr., who was one of the Eight Witnesses, reportedly weighed them and said in 1830 that they \"weighed thirty pounds\" (14 kg). Smith's brother William, who had lifted the plates, thought they \"weighed about sixty pounds [27 kg] according to the best of my judgment\". Others who lifted the plates while they were wrapped in cloth or enclosed in a box thought that they weighed about 60 pounds [27 kg]. Martin Harris said that he had \"hefted the plates many times, and should think they weighed forty or fifty pounds [18–23 kg]\". Smith's wife Emma never estimated the weight of the plates but said they were light enough for her to \"move them from place to place on the table, as it was necessary in doing my work\". Based on some of the descriptions of the plates' dimensions, one scholar speculates that, had the plates been made of 24-karat gold (which Smith never claimed), they would have weighed about 140 pounds (64 kg), while LDS writers have speculated that the plates were made of a copper-gold alloy like tumbaga, which would have weighed significantly less.\n\nAccording to Smith and others, the golden plates contained a \"sealed\" portion containing \"a revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the ending thereof.\" Smith never described the nature of the seal, and the language of the Book of Mormon may be interpreted to describe a sealing that was spiritual, metaphorical, physical, or a combination of these elements.\n\nThe Book of Mormon refers to other documents and plates as being \"sealed\" to be revealed at some future time. For example, the Book of Mormon says the entire set of plates was \"sealed up, and hid up unto the Lord\" and that separate records of John the Apostle were \"sealed up to come forth in their purity\" in the end times. One set of plates to which the Book of Mormon refers was \"sealed up\" in the sense that they were written in a language that could not be read.\n\nSmith may have understood the sealing to be a supernatural or spiritual sealing \"by the power of God\" (2 Nephi 27:10), an idea supported by a reference in the Book of Mormon to the \"interpreters\" with which Smith said they were buried or \"sealed.\" Oliver Cowdery also stated that when Smith visited the hill, he was stricken by a supernatural force because the plates were \"sealed by the prayer of faith.\"\n\nSeveral witnesses described a physical sealing placed on part of the plates by Mormon or Moroni. David Whitmer said that when an angel showed him the plates in 1829, \"a large portion of the leaves were so securely bound together that it was impossible to separate them,\" that the \"sealed\" part of the plates were held together as a solid mass \"stationary and immovable,\" \"as solid to my view as wood,\" and that there were \"perceptible marks where the plates appeared to be sealed\" with leaves \"so securely bound that it was impossible to separate them.\" In 1842, Lucy Mack Smith said that some of the plates were \"sealed together\" while others were \"loose.\" The account of the Eight Witnesses says they saw the plates in 1829 and handled \"as many of the leaves as Smith has translated,\" implying that they did not examine untranslated parts, such as the sealed portion. In one interview, David Whitmer said that \"about half\" the book was unsealed; in 1881, he said \"about one-third\" was unsealed. Whitmer's 1881 statement is consistent with an 1856 statement by Orson Pratt, an associate of Smith's who never saw the plates himself but who had spoken with witnesses, that \"about two-thirds\" of the plates were \"sealed up\".\n\nThe golden plates were said to contain engravings that the Book of Mormon describes as reformed Egyptian. Smith described the writing as \"Egyptian characters ... small, and beautifully engraved,\" exhibiting \"much skill in the art of engraving.\"\n\nJohn Whitmer, one of the Eight Witnesses, said the plates had \"fine engravings on both sides,\" and Orson Pratt, who did not see the plates himself but who had spoken with witnesses, understood that there were engravings on both sides of the plates, \"stained with a black, hard stain, so as to make the letters more legible and easier to be read.\"\n\nThe golden plates are significant within the Latter Day Saint movement because they are the reputed source for the Book of Mormon, which Smith called the \"most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion.\" However, the golden plates are just one of many known and reputed metal plates with significance in the Latter Day Saint movement. The Book of Mormon itself refers to a long tradition of writing historical records on plates, of which the golden plates are a culmination (see List of plates (Latter Day Saint movement)). In addition, Smith once believed in the authenticity of a set of engraved metal plates called the Kinderhook plates, although these plates turned out to be a hoax by non-Mormons who sought to entice Smith to translate them in order to discredit his reputation.\n\nTwo other sets of alleged plates, the Voree plates and the Book of the Law of the Lord, were translated by James Strang—one of three major contenders to succeed Smith—who went on to lead the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite).\n\nSome Latter Day Saints, especially those within the Community of Christ, have doubted the historicity of the golden plates and downplayed their significance. For most Latter Day Saints, however, the physical existence and authenticity of the golden plates are essential elements of their faith. For them, the message of the Book of Mormon is inseparable from the story of its origins.\n\nHugh Nibley said in 1957 that proof of the actual existence of the golden plates would not settle disputes about the Book of Mormon and the story of its origin.\n\n\n"}

Additionally, Louis XIV’s granddaughter-in-law, Marie-Adélaïde de Savoie, as duchesse de Bourgogne, occupied these rooms from 1697, the year of her marriage, to her death in 1712.\n\nWhen Louis Le Vau’s envelope of the \"château vieux\" (old palace) was completed, the \"grand appartement de la reine\" came to include a suite of seven enfilade rooms on the main floor in the left wing with an arrangement that mirrored almost exactly the \"grand appartement du roi\" in the right wing. The configuration was:\n\n\nAs with the decoration of the ceiling in the \"grand appartement du roi\", which depicted the heroic actions of Louis XIV as allegories from events taken from the antique past, the decoration of the \"grand appartement de la reine\" likewise depicted heroines from the antique past and harmonized with the general theme of a particular room’s decor.\n\nWith the construction of the Hall of Mirrors, which began in 1678, the configuration of the \"grand appartement de la reine\" changed. The chapel was transformed into the \"salle des gardes de la reine\" and it was in this room that the decorations from the \"salon de Jupiter\" were reused. The \"salle des gardes de la reine\" communicates with a loggia that issues from the \"escalier de la reine\" (Queen's staircase), which corresponded (albeit a smaller, though similarly-decorated example) to the \"escalier des ambassadeurs\" (Ambassador's Staircase) in the \"grand appartement du roi\". The loggia also provides access to the \"appartement du roi\", the suite of rooms in which Louis XIV lived. Toward the end of Louis XIV’s reign, the \"escalier de la reine\" became the principal entrance to the château, with the \"escalier des ambassadeurs\" used on rare state occasions. After the destruction of the \"escalier des ambassadeurs\" in 1752, the \"escalier de la reine\" became the main entrance to the château.\n\nFrom 1682, the \"grand appartement de la reine\" included:\n\n\nWith the death of Louis XIV in 1715, the court moved to Vincennes and later to Paris. In 1722, Louis XV reinstalled the court at Versailles and began modifications to the château’s interior. Among the most noteworthy of the building projects during Louis XV’s reign, the redecoration of the \"chambre de la reine\" must be cited.\n\nTo commemorate the birth of his only son and heir, Louis, in 1729, Louis XV ordered a complete redecoration of the room. Elements of the \"chambre de la reine\" as it had been used by Marie-Thérèse and Marie-Adélaïde de Savoie were removed and a new, more modern decor was installed.\n\nDuring her life at Versailles, Marie Leszczynska (1703–1768) lived in the \"grand appartement de la reine\", to which she annexed the \"salon de la paid\" to serve as a music room. In 1770, when the Austrian archduchess Marie-Antoinette married the dauphin, later Louis XVI, she took up residence in these rooms. Upon Louis XVI’s ascension to the throne in 1774, Marie-Antoinette ordered major redecoration of the \"grand appartement de la reine\". At this time, the queen’s apartment achieved the arrangement that we see today.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "392438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=392438", "title": "Herbarium", "text": "Herbarium\n\nA herbarium (plural: herbaria) is a collection of preserved plant specimens and associated data used for scientific study. .\n\nThe specimens may be whole plants or plant parts; these will usually be in dried form mounted on a sheet of paper (called \"exsiccatae\"\") but, depending upon the material, may also be stored in boxes or kept in alcohol or other preservative. The specimens in a herbarium are often used as reference material in describing plant taxa; some specimens may be types.\n\nThe same term is often used in mycology to describe an equivalent collection of preserved fungi, otherwise known as a fungarium. A xylarium is a herbarium specialising in specimens of wood. The term hortorium (as in the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium) has occasionally been applied to a herbarium specialising in preserving material of horticultural origin.\n\nThe oldest traditions of making herbarium collection or \"Hortus sicci\" have been traced to Italy. Luca Ghini and his students created herbaria of which the oldest extant one is that of Gherardo Cibo from around 1532. While most of the early herbaria were prepared with sheets bound into books, Carolus Linnaeus came up with the idea of maintaining them on free sheets that allowed their easy re-ordering within cabinets.\n\nCommensurate with the need of wildlife conservation, it is often desirable to include in a herbarium sheet as much of the plant as possible (e.g., flowers, stems, leaves, seed, and fruit), or at least representative parts of them in the case of large specimens. To preserve their form and colour, plants collected in the field are carefully arranged and spread flat between thin sheets, known as 'flimsies', (equivalent to sheets of newsprint) and dried, usually in a plant press, between blotters or absorbent paper. During the drying process the specimens are retained within their flimsies at all times to minimise damage, and only the thicker, absorbent drying sheets are replaced. For some plants it may prove helpful to allow the fresh specimen to wilt slightly before being arranged for the press. An opportunity to check, rearrange and further lay out the specimen to best reveal the required features of the plant occurs when the damp absorbent sheets are changed during the drying/pressing process. \n\nThe specimens, which are then mounted on sheets of stiff white paper, are labelled with all essential data, such as date and place found, description of the plant, altitude, and special habitat conditions. The sheet is then placed in a protective case. As a precaution against insect attack, the pressed plant is frozen or poisoned, and the case disinfected.\n\nCertain groups of plants are soft, bulky, or otherwise not amenable to drying and mounting on sheets. For these plants, other methods of preparation and storage may be used. For example, conifer cones and palm fronds may be stored in labelled boxes. Representative flowers or fruits may be pickled in formaldehyde to preserve their three-dimensional structure. Small specimens, such as mosses and lichens, are often air-dried and packaged in small paper envelopes. \n\nNo matter the method of preservation, detailed information on where and when the plant was collected, habitat, color (since it may fade over time), and the name of the collector is usually included.\n\nThe value of a herbarium is much enhanced by the possession of “types”, that is, the original specimens on which the study of a species was founded. Thus the herbarium at the British Museum, which is especially rich in the earlier collections made in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, contains the types of many species founded by the earlier workers in botany. It is also rich in types of Australian plants from the collections of Sir Joseph Banks and Robert Brown, and contains in addition many valuable modern collections. \n\nMost herbaria utilize a standard system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases. Specimen sheets are stacked in groups by the species to which they belong and placed into a large lightweight folder that is labelled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger, heavier folders by genus. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic family according to the standard system selected for use by the herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets.\n\nLocating a specimen filed in the herbarium requires knowing the nomenclature and classification used by the herbarium. It also requires familiarity with possible name changes that have occurred since the specimen was collected, since the specimen may be filed under an older name.\n\nModern herbaria often maintain electronic databases of their collections. Many herbaria have initiatives to digitize specimens to produce a virtual herbarium. These records and images are made publicly accessible via the Internet when possible.\n\nHerbarium collections can have great significance and value to science, and have a large number of uses. \nHerbaria are essential for the study of plant taxonomy, the study of geographic distributions, and the stabilizing of nomenclature. \nLinnaeus's herbarium now belongs to the Linnean Society in England.\n\nSpecimens housed in herbaria may be used to catalogue or identify the flora of an area. A large collection from a single area is used in writing a field guide or manual to aid in the identification of plants that grow there. With more specimens available, the author of the guide will better understand the variability of form in the plants and the natural distribution over which the plants grow.\n\nHerbaria also preserve a historical record of change in vegetation over time. In some cases, plants become extinct in one area or may become extinct altogether. In such cases, specimens preserved in a herbarium can represent the only record of the plant's original distribution. Environmental scientists make use of such data to track changes in climate and human impact.\n\nHerbaria have also proven very useful as sources of plant DNA for use in taxonomy and molecular systematics\n\nMany kinds of scientists and naturalists use herbaria to preserve voucher specimens; representative samples of plants used in a particular study to demonstrate precisely the source of their data, or to enable confirmation of identification at a future date.\n\nThey may also be a repository of viable seeds for rare species.\n\nMany universities, museums, and botanical gardens maintain herbaria. The largest herbaria in the world, in approximate order of decreasing size, are:\n\n\n"}

The files record 66,081 civilian deaths out of 109,000 recorded deaths. The leak resulted in the Iraq Body Count project adding 15,000 civilian deaths to their count, bringing their total to over 150,000, with roughly 80% of those civilians. It is the biggest leak in the military history of the United States, surpassing the Afghan War documents leak of 25 July 2010.\n\nThe logs contain numerous reports of previously unknown or unconfirmed events that took place during the war.\n\nAfter criticism over the Afghan War documents leak, more material, including certain names and details, were redacted from these documents by WikiLeaks.\n\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\nWikileaks made the documents available under embargo to a number of media organisations: \"Der Spiegel\", \"The Guardian\", \"The New York Times\", \"Al Jazeera\", \"Le Monde\", the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, and the Iraq Body Count project. Upon the lifting of the embargo, the media coverage by these groups was followed by further coverage by other media organisations. \"The Guardian\" said that \"the \"New York Times\", \"Washington Post\" and other papers were accused by web publications and some bloggers of downplaying the extent to which the documents revealed US complicity in torture and provided evidence that politicians in Washington \"lied\" about the failures of the US military mission\". \"The Guardian\" had reported that \"fresh evidence that US soldiers handed over detainees to a notorious Iraqi torture squad has emerged in army logs published by WikiLeaks\", and Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com commented that \"media outlets around the world prominently highlighted this revelation, but not \"The New York Times\"\", calling their coverage of the document leak \"subservient\" to the Pentagon, and criticising them for what he called a \"gossipy, People Magazine-style 'profile' of Assange\".\n\nWhile the U.S. tally of Iraqi & US-led Coalition deaths in the war logs is 109,000, a widely quoted 2006 study published in \"The Lancet\" used a cross-sectional cluster sample to estimate about 650,000 deaths were due to the Iraq war increasing mortality. Another study by the World Health Organization called the Iraq Family Health Survey estimated 151,000 deaths due to violence (95% uncertainty range, 104,000 to 223,000) from March 2003 through June 2006.

{"id": "81166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81166", "title": "King Solomon's Mines", "text": "King Solomon's Mines\n\nKing Solomon's Mines (1885) is a popular novel by the English Victorian adventure writer and fabulist Sir H. Rider Haggard. It tells of a search of an unexplored region of Africa by a group of adventurers led by Allan Quatermain for the missing brother of one of the party. It is the first English adventure novel set in Africa, and is considered to be the genesis of the Lost World literary genre.\n\nThe book was first published in September 1885 amid considerable fanfare, with billboards and posters around London announcing \"The Most Amazing Book Ever Written\". It became an immediate best seller. By the late 19th century, explorers were uncovering ancient civilisations around the world, such as Egypt's Valley of the Kings, and the empire of Assyria. Inner Africa remained largely unexplored and \"King Solomon's Mines\", the first novel of African adventure published in English, captured the public's imagination.\n\nThe \"King Solomon\" of the book's title is the Biblical king renowned both for his wisdom and for his wealth. A number of sites have been suggested as the location of his mines, including the workings at the Timna valley near Eilat. Research published in September 2013 has shown that this site was in use during the 10th century BC as a copper mine possibly by the Edomites, who the Bible reports were rivals of and frequently at war with King Solomon.\n\nHaggard knew Africa well, having travelled deep within the continent as a 19-year-old during the Anglo-Zulu War and the First Boer War, where he had been impressed by South Africa's vast mineral wealth and by the ruins of ancient lost cities being uncovered, such as Great Zimbabwe. His original Allan Quatermain character was based in large part on Frederick Courtney Selous, the British white hunter and explorer of Colonial Africa. Selous's real-life experiences provided Haggard with the background and inspiration for this and many later stories.\n\nHaggard also owed a considerable debt to Joseph Thomson, the Scottish explorer whose book \"Through Masai Land\" was a hit in January 1885. Thomson claimed he had terrified warriors in Kenya by taking out his false teeth and claiming to be a magician, just as Captain Good does in \"King Solomon's Mines\". Contemporary James Runciman wrote an article entitled \"King Plagiarism and His Court\", interpreted as accusing Haggard of plagiarism for this. Thomson was so outraged at Haggard's alleged plagiarism that he published a novel of his own, \"Ulu: an African Romance\", which, however, failed to sell.\n\nAllan Quatermain, an adventurer and white hunter based in Durban, in what is now South Africa, is approached by aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good, seeking his help finding Sir Henry's brother, who was last seen travelling north into the unexplored interior on a quest for the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Quatermain has a mysterious map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken it seriously. However, he agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the way. He has little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. They also take along a mysterious native, Umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well-spoken than most porters of his class, but who is very anxious to join the party.\n\nTravelling by oxcart, they reach the edge of a desert, but not before a hunt in which a wounded elephant claims the life of a servant. They continue on foot across the desert, almost dying of thirst before finding the oasis shown halfway across on the map. Reaching a mountain range called Suliman Berg, they climb a peak (one of \"Sheba's Breasts\") and enter a cave where they find the frozen corpse of José Silvestre (also spelt Silvestra), the 16th-century Portuguese explorer who drew the map in his own blood. That night, a second servant dies from the cold, so they leave his body next to Silvestra's, to \"give him a companion\".\nThey cross the mountains into a raised valley, lush and green, known as Kukuanaland. The inhabitants have a well-organised army and society and speak an ancient dialect of IsiZulu. Kukuanaland's capital is Loo, the destination of a magnificent road from ancient times. The city is dominated by a central royal kraal.\n\nThey soon meet a party of Kukuana warriors who are about to kill them when Captain Good nervously fidgets with his false teeth, making the Kukuanas recoil in fear. Thereafter, to protect themselves, they style themselves \"white men from the stars\"—sorcerer-gods—and are required to give regular proof of their divinity, considerably straining both their nerves and their ingenuity.\n\nThey are brought before King Twala, who rules over his people with ruthless violence. He came to power years before when he murdered his brother, the previous king, and drove his brother's wife and infant son, Ignosi, out into the desert to die. Twala's rule is unchallenged. An evil, impossibly ancient hag named Gagool is his chief advisor. She roots out any potential opposition by ordering regular witch hunts and murdering without trial all those identified as traitors. When she singles out Umbopa for this fate, it takes all Quatermain's skill to save his life.\n\nGagool, it appears, has already sensed what Umbopa soon after reveals: he is Ignosi, the rightful king of the Kukuanas. A rebellion breaks out, the Englishmen gaining support for Ignosi by taking advantage of their foreknowledge of a lunar eclipse to claim that they will black out the moon as proof of Ignosi's claim. (In early editions, this was a solar eclipse; Haggard changed it after realising that his description of a solar eclipse was not realistic) The Englishmen join Ignosi's army in a furious battle. Although outnumbered, the rebels overthrow Twala, and Sir Henry lops off his head in a duel.\n\nThe Englishmen also capture Gagool, who reluctantly leads them to King Solomon's Mines. She shows them a treasure room inside a mountain, carved deep within the living rock and full of gold, diamonds, and ivory. She then treacherously sneaks out while they are admiring the hoard and triggers a secret mechanism that closes the mine's vast stone door. However, a brief scuffle with a beautiful Kukuana woman named Foulata—who had become attached to Good after nursing him through his injuries sustained in the battle—causes her to be crushed under the stone door, though not before fatally stabbing Foulata. Their scant store of food and water rapidly dwindling, the trapped men prepare to die also. After a few despairing days sealed in the dark chamber, they find an escape route, bringing with them a few pocketfuls of diamonds from the immense trove, enough to make them rich.\n\nThe Englishmen bid farewell to a sorrowful Ignosi and return to the desert, assuring him that they value his friendship but must return to be with their own people, Ignosi in return promising them that they will be venerated and honoured among his people forever. Taking a different route, they find Sir Henry's brother stranded in an oasis by a broken leg, unable to go forward or back. They return to Durban and eventually to England, wealthy enough to live comfortable lives.\n\nHaggard wrote the novel as a result of a five-shilling wager with his brother, who said that he could not write a novel half as good as Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island\" (1883). He wrote it in a short time, somewhere between six and sixteen weeks between January and 21 April 1885. However, the book was a complete novelty and was rejected by one publisher after another. After six months, \"King Solomon's Mines\" was published, and the book became the year's best seller, with printers struggling to print copies fast enough.\n\nIn the process, \"King Solomon's Mines\" created a new genre known as the \"Lost World\", which would inspire Edgar Rice Burroughs' \"The Land That Time Forgot\", Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\", Rudyard Kipling's \"The Man Who Would Be King\" and H. P. Lovecraft's \"At the Mountains of Madness\". Lee Falk's \"The Phantom\" was initially written in this genre. A much later Lost World novel was Michael Crichton's \"Congo\", which involves a quest for King Solomon's lost mines, supposedly located in a lost African city called Zinj.\n\nAs in \"Treasure Island\", the narrator of \"King Solomon's Mines\" tells his tale in the first person in an easy conversational style. Almost entirely missing (except in the speech of the Kukuanas) is the ornate language usually associated with novels of this era. Haggard's use of the first person subjective perspective also contrasts with the omniscient third-person viewpoint then in vogue among influential writers such as Anthony Trollope, Thomas Hardy, and George Eliot.\n\nThe book has scholarly value for the colonialist attitudes that Haggard expresses, and for the way that he portrays the relationships between the white and African characters. Haggard portrays some African characters as barbarians, such as Twala and Gagool, but their barbarity has more to do with their roles as antagonists in the story than with their African heritage. He also presents the other side of the coin, showing some black Africans as heroes and heroines (such as Ignosi), and showing respect for their culture. The book expresses much less prejudice than some of the later books in this genre. Indeed, Quatermain states that he refuses to use the word \"nigger\" and that many Africans are more worthy of the title of \"gentleman\" than the Europeans who settle or adventure in the country. Haggard even includes an interracial romance between a Kukuana woman, Foulata, and the white Englishman Captain Good. The narrator tries to discourage the relationship, dreading the uproar that such a marriage would cause back home in England; however, he has no objection to the lady, whom he considers very beautiful and noble. Haggard eventually kills off Foulata, who dies in Good's arms.\n\nKukuanaland is said in the book to be forty leagues north of the Lukanga river in modern Zambia, which would place it in the extreme southeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The culture of the Kukuanas shares many attributes with other South African tribes, such as Zulu being spoken and the kraal system being used.\n\nThe novel has been adapted to film at least six times. The first version premiered in 1937, \"King Solomon's Mines\", and was directed by Robert Stevenson. The best known version premiered in 1950, \"King Solomon's Mines\", directed by Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton, which was followed by a sequel, \"Watusi\" (1959). In 1979 a low-budget version was directed by Alvin Rakoff, \"King Solomon's Treasure\", combining both \"King Solomon's Mines\" as well as \"Allan Quatermain\" in one story. The 1985 film, \"King Solomon's Mines\", was a more tongue-in-cheek parody of the story, followed by a sequel in the same vein: \"Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold\" (1987). Around the same period an Australian animated TV film came out, \"King Solomon's Mines\". In December 2006, the movie, “” was released as the second in a trilogy that follows one man’s fantastical adventures. In 2008 a direct-to-video adaptation, \"Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls\" was released by Mark Atkins, which bore more resemblance to Indiana Jones than the novel.\n\nBritish comics artist Dudley D. Watkins adapted the story into a text comics series.\n\nIn 2002 a documentary was made by National Geographic Television in collaboration with Channel 4 in the UK: \"The Search for King Solomon's Mines\".\n\nIn 2004 a TV mini-series was created: \"King Solomon's Mines\".\n\nKenneth Colley starred as Allan Quatermain in a 1990 BBC Radio 4 adaptation.\n\nA two-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation was broadcast in April 2017 starring Tim McInnerny as Allan Quatermain.\n\n"}
{"id": "18303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18303", "title": "Liber Pontificalis", "text": "Liber Pontificalis\n\nThe Liber Pontificalis (Latin for 'pontifical book' or \"Book of the Popes\") is a book of biographies of popes from Saint Peter until the 15th century. The original publication of the \"Liber Pontificalis\" stopped with Pope Adrian II (867–872) or Pope Stephen V (885–891), but it was later supplemented in a different style until Pope Eugene IV (1431–1447) and then Pope Pius II (1458–1464). Although quoted virtually uncritically from the 8th to 18th century, the \"Liber Pontificalis\" has undergone intense modern scholarly scrutiny. The work of the French priest Louis Duchesne (who compiled the major scholarly edition), and of others has highlighted some of the underlying redactional motivations of different sections, though such interests are so disparate and varied as to render improbable one popularizer's claim that it is an \"unofficial instrument of pontifical propaganda.\"\n\nThe title \"Liber Pontificalis\" goes back to the 12th century, although it only became current in the 15th century, and the canonical title of the work since the edition of Duchesne in the 19th century. In the earliest extant manuscripts it is referred to as Liber episcopalis in quo continentur acta beatorum pontificum Urbis Romae ('episcopal book in which are contained the acts of the blessed pontiffs of the city of Rome') and later the Gesta or Chronica pontificum.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Saint Jerome was considered the author of all the biographies up until those of Pope Damasus I (366–383), based on an apocryphal letter between Saint Jerome and Pope Damasus published as a preface to the Medieval manuscripts. The attribution originated with Rabanus Maurus and is repeated by Martin of Opava, who extended the work into the 13th century. Other sources attribute the early work to Hegesippus and Irenaeus, having been continued by Eusebius of Caesarea.\n\nIn the 16th century, Onofrio Panvinio attributed the biographies after Damasus until Pope Nicholas I (858–867) to Anastasius Bibliothecarius; Anastasius continued to be cited as the author into the 17th century, although this attribution was disputed by the scholarship of Caesar Baronius, Ciampini, Schelstrate and others.\n\nThe modern interpretation, following that of Louis Duchesne, is that the \"Liber Pontificalis\" was gradually and unsystematically compiled, and that the authorship is impossible to determine, with a few exceptions (e.g. the biography of Pope Stephen II (752–757) to papal \"Primicerius\" Christopher; the biographies of Pope Nicholas I and Pope Adrian II (867–872) to Anastasius). Duchesne and others have viewed the beginning of the \"Liber Pontificalis\" up until the biographies of Pope Felix III (483–492) as the work of a single author, who was a contemporary of Pope Anastasius II (496-498), relying on \"Catalogus Liberianus\", which in turn draws from the papal catalogue of Hippolytus of Rome, and the \"Leonine Catalogue\", which is no longer extant. Most scholars believe the \"Liber Pontificalis\" was first compiled in the 5th or 6th century.\n\nBecause of the use of the \"vestiarium\", the records of the papal treasury, some have hypothesized that the author of the early \"Liber Pontificalis\" was a clerk of the papal treasury. Edward Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1788) summarised the scholarly consensus as being that the \"Liber Pontificalis\" was composed by \"apostolic librarians and notaries of the viii and ix centuries\" with only the most recent portion being composed by Anastasius.\n\nDuchesne and others believe that the author of the first addition to the \"Liber Pontificalis\" was a contemporary of Pope Silverius (536–537), and that the author of another (not necessarily the second) addition was a contemporary of Pope Conon (686–687), with later popes being added individually and during their reigns or shortly after their deaths.\n\nThe \"Liber Pontificalis\" originally only contained the names of the bishops of Rome and the durations of their pontificates. As enlarged in the 6th century, each biography consists of: the birth name of the pope and that of his father, place of birth, profession before elevation, length of pontificate, historical notes of varying thoroughness, major theological pronouncements and decrees, administrative milestones (including building campaigns, especially of Roman churches), ordinations, date of death, place of burial, and the duration of the ensuing \"sede vacante\".\n\nPope Adrian II (867–872) is the last pope for which there are extant manuscripts of the original \"Liber Pontificalis\": the biographies of Pope John VIII, Pope Marinus I, and Pope Adrian III are missing and the biography of Pope Stephen V (885–891) is incomplete. From Stephen V through the 10th and 11th centuries, the historical notes are extremely abbreviated, usually with only the pope's origin and reign duration.\n\nIt was only in the 12th century that the \"Liber Pontificalis\" was systematically continued, although papal biographies exist in the interim period in other sources.\n\nDuchesne refers to the 12th century work by Petrus Guillermi in 1142 at the monastery of St. Gilles (Diocese of Reims) as the \"Liber Pontificalis of Petrus Guillermi (son of William)\". Guillermi's version is mostly copied from other works with small additions or excisions from the papal biographies of Pandulf, nephew of Hugo of Alatri, which in turn was copied almost verbatim from the original \"Liber Pontificalis\" (with the notable exception of the biography of Pope Leo IX), then from other sources until Pope Honorius II (1124–1130), and with contemporary information from Pope Paschal II (1099–1118) to Pope Urban II (1088–1099).\n\nDuchesne attributes all biographies from Pope Gregory VII to Urban II to Pandulf, while earlier historians like Giesebrecht and Watterich attributed the biographies of Gregory VII, Victor III, and Urban II to Petrus Pisanus, and the subsequent biographies to Pandulf. These biographies until those of Pope Martin IV (1281–1285) are extant only as revised by Petrus Guillermi in the manuscripts of the monastery of St. Gilles having been taken from the Chronicle of Martin of Opava.\n\nEarly in the 14th century, an unknown author built upon the continuation of Petrus Guillermi, adding the biographies of popes Martin IV (d. 1285) through John XXII (1316–1334), with information taken from the \"Chronicon Pontificum\" of Bernardus Guidonis, stopping abruptly in 1328.\n\nIndependently, the cardinal-nephew of Pope Adrian IV, Cardinal Boso intended to extend the \"Liber Pontificalis\" from where it left off with Stephen V, although his work was only published posthumously as the \"Gesta Romanorum Pontificum\" alongside the \"Liber Censuum\" of Pope Honorius III. Boso drew on Bonizo of Sutri for popes from John XII to Gregory VII, and wrote from his own experiences about the popes from Gelasius II (1118–1119) to Alexander III (1179–1181).\n\nAn independent continuation appeared in the reign of Pope Eugene IV (1431–1447), appending biographies from Pope Urban V (1362–1370) to Pope Martin V (1417–1431), encompassing the period of the Western Schism. A later recension of this continuation was expanded under Pope Eugene IV.\n\nThe two collections of papal biographies of the 15th century remain independent, although they may have been intended to be continuations of the \"Liber Pontificalis\". The first extends from popes Benedict XII (1334–1342) to Martin V (1417–1431), or in one manuscript to Eugene IV (1431–1447). The second extends from Pope Urban VI (1378–1389) to Pope Pius II (1458–1464).\n\nThe \"Liber Pontificalis\" was first edited by J. Busæus under the title \"Anastasii bibliothecarii Vitæ seu Gesta. Romanorum Pontificum\" (Mainz, 1602). A new edition, including the \"Historia ecclesiastica\" of Anastasius, was edited by Fabrotti (Paris, l647). Another edition, editing the older \"Liber Pontificalis\" up to Pope Adrian II and adding Pope Stephen VI, was compiled by Fr. Bianchini (4 vols., Rome, 1718–35; a projected fifth volume did not appear). Muratori reprinted Bianchini's edition, adding the remaining popes through John XXII (Scriptores rerum Italicarum, III). Migne also republished Bianchini's edition, adding several appendixes (P. L., CXXVII-VIII).\n\nModern editions include those of Louis Duchesne (\"Liber Pontificalis. Texte, introduction et commentaire\", 2 vols., Paris, 1886–92) and Theodor Mommsen (\"Gestorum Pontificum Romanorum pars I: Liber Pontificalis\", Mon. Germ. hist., Berlin, 1898). Duchesne incorporates the \"Annales Romani\" (1044–1187) into his edition of the \"Liber Pontificalis\", which otherwise relies on the two earliest known recensions of the work (530 and 687). Mommsen's edition is incomplete, extending only until 715. Translations and further commentaries appeared throughout the 20th century.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first known as the Maritime Museum of Canada and located at HMC Dockyard, the naval base on Halifax Harbour. Several naval officers served as volunteer chairs of the museum until 1959 when Niels Jannasch was hired as the museum's founding director, serving until 1985. The museum moved through several locations over the next three decades before its current building was constructed in 1981 as part of a waterfront redevelopment program. The museum received the CSS \"Acadia\" in 1982. Today the museum is part of the Nova Scotia Museum system.\n\nThe museum was one of the first attractions to open on the redeveloped Halifax Waterfront. Its location provides the museum with several piers and boatsheds, as well as a strategic view of the Halifax Harbour looking seaward towards the Harbourmaster office and Georges Island and across to Dartmouth. Among its facilities is the restored 1880s Robertson Store ship chandler building, as well as modern exhibit galleries in the Devonian Wing (the modern museum building). HMCS \"Sackville\", a World War II Flower-class corvette is docked adjacent to the museum in the summer months but is not owned or administered by the museum.\n\nIn addition to the over 30,000 artifacts, the museum also has a collection of 30,000 photographs as well as a large collection of charts and rare books. A reference library, open to the public, is named after the Museum's founding director, The Niels Jannasch Library. The museum has Canada's largest collection of ship portraits including the oldest ship portrait in Canada as well as a large collection of ship models including the original production models of the television show Theodore Tugboat. Ongoing restoration of \"Whim\", a 1937 C-Class sloop can be found in one of the boatsheds on the wharf behind the museum. In addition to this current restoration project, the boatsheds house some of the museum's small craft collection. During the summer months three boats in the working small craft collection can be found moored next to the CSS \"Acadia\". In July 2017 the museum also completed restoration of the small schooner Hebridee II.\n\nPublic galleries include the Days of Sail, the Age of Steam, Small Craft, the Canadian Navy, the Halifax Explosion, and Shipwrecks. A special permanent exhibit explores the sinking of RMS \"Titanic\" with an emphasis on Nova Scotia's connection to recovering the bodies of \"Titanic\" victims. The museum has the world's foremost collection of wooden artifacts from \"Titanic\", including one of the few surviving deck chairs. The \"Titanic\" exhibit also includes a child's pair of shoes which helped identify \"Titanic\"s \"unknown child\" as Sidney Leslie Goodwin.\n\nThe adjacent exhibit \"Shipwreck Treasures of Nova Scotia\" explores the many other shipwrecks off the coast of Nova Scotia including archaeological discoveries on naval shipwrecks in Louisbourg Harbour and an unknown 1750s schooner at Lower Prospect, Nova Scotia. The results of treasure hunting are also featured in a section on Cape Breton treasure wrecks which has displays of weapons, instruments, gold and silver from wrecks such as the 1711 HMS \"Feversham\", the 1725 wreck of \"Chameau\" and the 1761 wreck of the ship \"Auguste\".\nThe Age of Steam gallery includes a special display on Samuel Cunard, the Nova Scotian who created the Cunard Line. The restored 1880s Robertson building includes the fully restored Robertson ship chandlerly which features hands on foghorns, ropes and ship fittings.\n\nThe Navy gallery includes the \"Convoy Exhibit\" about the Battle of the Atlantic which includes the Canadian Merchant Navy Book of Remembrance. Monuments to the Canadian and Norwegian Merchant Navy are located just outside the museum along with a unique children's playground in the shape of a submarine.\n\nThe museum also has a changing exhibits gallery. A 2009 exhibit \"Ship of Fate: The Tragic Voyage of the St. Louis\" was the first Canadian exhibit to explore the 1939 voyage of the Jewish refugee ship . The Museum became the first museum in North America to present an exhibit about the lives of gay seafarers in 2011 when it presented \"Hello Sailor: Gay Life on the Ocean Waves\", adapted from an exhibit developed at the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool, England. The 2012 exhibit explores the experiences of the cable ships based in Halifax who recovered most of the victims of the RMS \"Titanic\" sinking.\n\n\nThe corvette HMCS \"Sackville\" (K181) is not part of the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic but is located adjacent to the museum in the summer and works with the museum to interpret the Royal Canadian Navy.\n\nThe museum's location on the Halifax waterfront has made the Museum the site of several significant public events. In addition to being a stop on most Canadian federal election campaigns, the museum hosted meetings from the 1995 G7 Summit, as well a September 11 commemorative event in 2006 attended by Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Peter MacKay and United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. The Museum hosts an annual commemoration of the Battle of the Atlantic on the first Sunday of every May and Canadian Merchant Navy day every September 3.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42608252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42608252", "title": "Piraeus Athena", "text": "Piraeus Athena\n\nThe Piraeus Athena is a bronze statue dated to the fourth century BCE. It currently resides in the Archaeological Museum of Piraeus.\n\nThe Piraeus Athena was discovered in 1959, by workers who were drilling underground to install pipes. Bronze was first hit 1.5 meters below the ground; a few days later, they uncovered the statue at the intersection of Georgiou I Street and Philonos Street. The excavation of the statue was led by Efthymios Mastrokostas. The Piraeus Athena was found with three more large bronze statues, along with other artifacts. The Piraeus Athena was discovered in very good condition; however, it underwent irreparable damage after being abandoned on the damp floor of the Piraeus Museum according to the scholar, Steinhauer.\n\nThere are various theories about the origins of the Piraeus Athena. Because the room the statue was found in was very close to the main harbor, many scholars believe that the statue had been stored in a harbor’s stoa and were just about to be shipped. Additionally, the Piraeus Athena and other statues were not in random order but seemed to be packed. A coin found near the statues had a date equivalent to 87/86 BC on it, along with a picture of King Mithridates VI. Because it is known that Piraeus was captured by Sulla in 86 BC, many have further speculated two theories. One theory is that the statues were going to be shipped in order to save them from the Roman attack. The second theory is that the statues were being shipped by the Romans to Italy as part of their spoils. It is thought that the statue may have originally come from the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira in Piraeus. This is because the peplos in the statue is similar to the drapery of the peplos in the statue of Eirene by Cephisodotus the Elder, who was also known to have made a statue of Athena that resided in the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira. Other scholars believe that the statue may have come from Delos, since three of the statues found with the Piraeus Athena were of Artemis, and Delos was considered the birthplace of Artemis. Additionally, the Romans had captured Delos in 88 BC and therefore the statues could have been part of the scared funds Mithradates’ general had sent to Delos. Due to the dating, it has been estimated that the Piraeus Athena probably dates back to 360-340 BCE.\n\nIt is over-life sized, with a height of 2.35 meters (approximately 8 feet). It is identified as a cult statue.\n\nAthena is wearing a peplos that is open on the right side. The cloth of the peplos appears heavy, as evidenced from the deep cloth lines in the sculpture. The heavy material hints that the statue was not from early in the fourth century, but probably towards the middle, since earlier in the fourth century, luxurious transparent cloth was the style. Here, on the other hand, we see Athena wearing a peplos made from thick cloth that became fashionable later during the fourth century, according to the scholar, John Pedley. The heavy cloth is also noted to re-emphasize her physical presence.\n\nThe Piraeus Athena is often mentioned to seem approachable by the scholar, Neer. This serves as a stark contrast from the Archaic style, where gods were often depicted as stern according to Neer One reason Athena here is perceived approachable is due to her stance. The Piraeus Athena, here is in contrapposto stance, meaning that her left leg is more relaxed, while she is putting her weight on the right leg. This position portrays the idea that she is almost stooping towards the mortal viewer. The passive and gentle expression on her face is also denoted with an air of approachability according.\n\nAthena is shown to have an aegis diagonally across her peplos in the sculpture. The aegis has a miniature Gorgon's head on it along with a border of snakes. Its small dimensions make it to be more like a marker of Athena’s identity than an actual piece of armament. The diagonal positioning of the aegis is seen to give Athena a swaying motion — some say in order to have the viewer’s eye look towards what Athena was holding in her right hand. There is a hole in the palm of the right hand and the right thumb indicating that Athena was originally holding an item, but that item's identity it is not certain. Some suggest it might have been an owl or the representation of victory, Nike. It is also thought that Athena may have held in her left hand a spear or a shield.\n\nAthena additionally wears a helmet, which also helps to date the statue. This is because Athena wears a Corinthian helmet, which in fourth century B.C became very popular, as opposed to an Attic helmet where she is shown wearing in other sculptures. The helmet in the Piraeus Athena has griffins on each side of the crest, and two owls on the visor.\n\nThe Piraeus Athena has been determined to be an original, and many believe that the Athena Mattei exposed in the Louvre is the sole existing copy of it, even though the position of the right arm is in a different position. There are various artists who have been thought to have possibly made the Piraeus Athena. Some say it could be the work of Cephisodotos, who is known to have made a statue of Athena during the fourth century BC. Others say that it may be the work of Euphranor because it shares similarities with one of his other works, the Apollo Patroos. Similarities include a full face and long neck that indicates a similarity in style, according to the scholar, Olga Palagia.\n\n\n\n"}

Rounds, 686 F.3d 889 (8th Cir. 2012) (en banc), was a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit that upheld a provision of a South Dakota law that requires a doctor to inform a patient, prior to providing an abortion, that one of the \"known medical risks of the procedure and statistically significant risk factors\" is an \"increased risk of suicide ideation and suicide.\"\n\nThe district court, in setting the initial injunction against enforcing this law, relied on studies that showed some correlation between abortion and suicide, but showed no evidence that an abortion causes a woman to be at greater risk for suicide. Rather, the studies indicated that the same factors that cause a woman to seek an abortion, like emotional distress, domestic violence and socioeconomic disadvantage, also make them more likely to be depressed and suicidal. The scientific consensus is that abortion does not increase the risk of any mental health problems.\n\nThe Eighth Circuit noted that states may mandate disclosures as part of obtaining informed consent, so long as those disclosures are neither false nor misleading. The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that the record did not support an inference that abortion causes suicide. However, the court said that the South Dakota law does not require doctors to inform women that abortion causes suicide; it requires only that women hear that abortion is associated with an increased risk of suicide, and as used in its scientific sense, \"association\" does not imply causation.\n\n"}
{"id": "7998588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7998588", "title": "Press pass", "text": "Press pass\n\nA press pass (alternatively referred to as a press card or a journalist pass) grants some type of special privilege to journalists. Some cards have recognized legal status; others merely indicate that the bearer is a practicing journalist. The nature of the benefits is determined by the type of issuing agency, of which there are three major categories: news organizations, law-enforcement agencies, and event organizers (usually for a specific single affair like a corporate press conference). Each type of card grants different authorizations, thus it is often necessary or desirable for reporters to hold multiple press passes simultaneously.\n\nPolice departments at a city, county, or state/provincial level may issue press passes in some countries. Such passes allow the bearer to cross police or fire lines to report breaking news, or grant access to crime scenes or other restricted areas– though admission may be denied if it would interfere with the duties of emergency personnel. Popular media of the mid-20th century often depicted reporters at a crime scene with their press passes tucked into their hat bands, which was unusual in reality.\n\nBecause of the exceptional dispensation endowed by police press passes, they are issued with discretion–some jurisdictions require an in-person interview with all prospective applicants, complete set of fingerprints, and a background check. Generally, only reporters who cover breaking news are eligible; other journalists (feature writers, editors and editorialists, freelance writers, and bloggers) are not.\n\nPolice-issued passes do not grant access to government press conferences or any other such privileges: they are only recognized by emergency response personnel, and only valid within the jurisdiction of the issuing agencies.\n\nPolice parking permits, issued in some jurisdictions, exempt news vehicles from certain parking restrictions while on the job. They may be offered to any news-gathering organization that covers breaking news for use in company vehicles employed by full-time reporters, photographers, and camera operators. Often, these permits are only granted to journalists who already carry a police press card.\n\nWhen conspicuously displayed, these permits may allow the bearer to park in restricted \"resident-only\" parking zones, and may exempt him or her from parking-meter costs. These privileges apply only for the duration of breaking-news coverage, and do not nullify all parking restrictions: red zones, fire hydrants, crosswalks, bus zones, disabled parking zones or access ramps, commercial loading zones, taxi cab zones, \"no stopping\" or \"no parking\" zones, transit lanes, and other towaway zones are still off-limits.\n\nFor tradeshows, community gatherings, sporting events, award shows, professional conferences, or major events of any type, press passes are generally available. These are sometimes referred to as \"press badges\". For many events publicity in news media and elsewhere is of great importance, and granting privileges to the press can help in this. The privileges granted to holders of press badges, and who is eligible to receive them, depends on the nature of the affair.\n\nGenerally, prospective recipients must apply in advance, offering evidence of their affiliation. Event sponsors may request past published material, or a letter from the news agency on its letterhead, detailing the job assignment. Generally, non-reporting employees of news agencies (executives, sales personnel, publishers, editors, etc.) are not eligible for press passes. In addition to journalists, some bloggers may be granted event passes.\n\nMany major events, especially trade shows, issue press kits to pass-holders. A press pass may allow the bearer to request interviews with noteworthy attendees, and special rooms are sometimes set aside for this purpose.\n\nFor activities open to the public, such as community gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend on the number of tickets sold.\n\nFor events closed to the general public, police- or news organization-issued press passes sometimes grant access, but almost all require advance application for admittance. Greater exclusivity, however, means more restrictions on potential pass recipients. For professional conferences or trade shows, passes may be granted only to journalists who regularly cover the industry or who hold a title of \"industry analyst\", or with an editorial or reporting designation.\n\n\"You do not need to ask permission from anyone to be a journalist,\" explains the Periodical Publishers Association; \"however, it is sometimes useful to be able to identify yourself as a journalist when needed.\" To this end, journalistic agencies issue press cards to their reporters, editorialists, writers, and photographers. These do not have the legal merits of government-issued cards, and they will not replace event-specific passes; the card only serves as proof of its bearer's status as a legitimate newsperson according to the issuing organization. As such, card-carriers may be better able to obtain interviews, acquire information from law-enforcement, or gain access to exclusive venues.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the UK Press Card Authority (a voluntary consortium of news agencies) issues a nationally standardized card to United Kingdom-based news gatherers.\n\nIn most other European countries, cards are issued by national trade unions of journalists. Some require membership or government approval.\n\nFor freelance journalists, organizations like the National Writers Union, Professional Publishers Association issue cards. \n\nGenuine press cards can be obtained by people not entitled to them, counterfeit copies of real cards can be made, and plausible-looking cards can be issued by anybody, or made. The reasons and consequences range from the trivial (free drinks) to the catastrophic (access by terrorists to rulers).\n\nPress passes not issued by a recognised publication can be obtained or made, with the intention of gaining benefits offered to holders of legitimate press cards. Joan Stewart of the Public Relations Society of America reports, “Fake press passes abound at restaurant and theater openings, sporting events, music festivals, political rallies, celebrity parties and even crime scenes. With a decent computer and color printer, almost anybody can crank out an official-looking pass within minutes.”\n\nCounterfeit copies of cards issued by legitimate publications can be made. Issuers of cards have taken measures to prevent counterfeiting of their cards, creating cards with holographic foil blocking, signature strips, and tamper-resistant lamination.\n\n"}

The court thus appeared to endorse the \"proximate-cause\" criterion, also known as direct-consequences or individualisation theory, of legal causation. The court added that death is not the result of the original wound if it is just the setting in which another cause operates.

The sculpture was kept in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, but was lost in World War II. The bust was bought in 1899 (inventory no. 14475). The bust was about 14 cm high and made of greywacke. The identity of the woman shown was for a long time unknown, as the piece is uninscribed. The face of the woman shows clearly signs of age and dates therefore stylistically to the late Middle Kingdom, when most sculptures show people no longer ageless young as in other periods of Egyptian history. Today, the bust is known from photographic images, and also from preserved plaster casts.\n\nThe Egyptologist Biri Fay was able to locate the remaining part of the statue. It is now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (MFA 24.742, 21.4 cm high), but was once found in the temple of Taharqa in the Nubian fortress of Semna. The lower part of the statue is also uninscribed but shows on the throne the hieroglyphic signs \"uniting the two lands\" (zm3-t3wy). This is a royal symbol and only attested for kings. Therefore, this (now photographically united) statue shows a woman that ruled as king and must belong to Sobekneferu, the only ruling queen of the late Middle Kingdom. There are several statues known belonging to this ruling queen. However, each one is headless.\n"}
{"id": "33432718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33432718", "title": "The Haunting of Sunshine Girl", "text": "The Haunting of Sunshine Girl\n\nThe cast of \"The Haunting of Sunshine Girl\" is composed mostly of professional actors. McKenzie, the series's lead actress, did not initially identify herself by her real name, choosing instead to use the pseudonyms Sunshine Girl and Frances Jones until she revealed her real name in June 2013. She stars in the series along with her mother Mercedes Rose, Maxwell Arnold, Seth Renne, and Adrienne Vogel. The series is filmed at Hagen's home in Vancouver, Washington and other places in Washington and Oregon.\n\n\"The Haunting of Sunshine Girl\" tells the story of a teenage girl documenting the paranormal activity in her house. She uploads the short episodes on her YouTube channel.\n\nWhen Sunshine and her mother (Mercedes Rose) move into a new house, Sunshine begins experiencing paranormal activity. She decides to document her experiences in order to prove to her mother that the activity is real. Later, a strange woman (Adrienne Vogel) shows up at her house and warns Sunshine that the house is not safe. Meanwhile, the paranormal activity grows and gets more intense.\n\nSunshine receives a photograph of a man and a girl, both with bags over their heads, along with a note reading: \"They are watching you.\" Later, the two ghosts show themselves. The strange woman returns to give a box to Sunshine Girl, warning her not to open it. The box seems to stop the haunting, but it has a foul odor, and Sunshine and her mother open it. The ghosts return, worse than before. One of the ghosts attacks Sunshine Girl, keeping her locked in a bathroom, while the other ghost burns the strange photograph.\n\nSunshine asks the mysterious woman for help. Using a smudge stick, the stranger purifies Sunshine's house. The ghosts vanish, and Sunshine's mother finally believes they were real.\n\nThis season has more of a documentary feel, featuring interviews with real people, while continuing the plot. Sunshine and her mother take a roadtrip to Oregon in search of more haunted places. Along the way, Sunshine meets Anna, one of the ghosts haunting her house. Sunshine records strange EVP and hears a voice say \"don't trust her.\"\n\nAfter returning home, Sunshine Girl begins a search for her father. She finds an address that her mother was keeping from her, and, believing it might be her father's new home, she visits the place only to learn that it is a frightening abandoned house. Inside the house, she finds a copy of the same photograph of the man and girl, who she now knows are the spirits haunting her house. While returning home, a strange man tries to kill her. She hits him with her car, only to have him stand up again. Finally she escapes.\n\nSunshine discovers that her mom is possessed by a demon. She finds a local paranormal expert that is calling himself \"LeMaster\" (Rhyan Schwartz) and a medium called Alistair (Christopher Toyne). Alistair visits the home, where his mouth begins to bleed. He warns Sunshine not to trust her mom. Furious, Sunshine's mom orders the medium to leave. Later, Sunshine calls Alistair, only to learn that he has died.\n\nMeanwhile, LeMaster discovers that two ghosts belonged to a cult. The members have to sacrifice their first-born daughters to a demon—the same demon that has possessed Sunshine's mom. LeMaster does not want to become involved in this haunting and rejects Sunshine's pleas for help.\n\nDesperate, Sunshine uses her ouija board to contact the spirits. At that moment, the mysterious woman returns, revealing that her name is Victoria. She shows Sunshine the place where the cultists sacrificed their daughters, and tells Sunshine that the only way to save her mom is by pretending to sacrifice herself.\n\nDuring the sacrificial ceremony, the demon appears. Victoria tries to protect Sunshine, but the demon cuts her throat. Victoria disappears.\n\nWhile Sunshine waits in the rain with a bag sheltering her head, the man from the abandoned house appears, removes the bag, and tells her that the demon cannot take her because she is a \"luiseach\": a person with paranormal powers used to fight evil. After the man has gone, Sunshine's mom and Uncle Tommy (Seth Renne) find her. In the next video Sunshine reveals that her name is Frances Jones.\n\nAt the beginning of Season 4, Nolan, a 19-year-old boy, learns that Sunshine Girl is a \"luiseach\". Nolan persuades Sunshine to stay a night in his grandmother's haunted house. There they meet Frederick, a very violent and dangerous ghost. With Victoria's help, Sunshine delivers Frederick from being a ghost and ends the haunting.\n\nSunshine finds another anonymous letter in the mail showing a warehouse. Sunshine and Nolan go there, but can find nothing—until they see a man driving away. The man appears to have followed them.\n\nNolan tells Sunshine that he hears voices. He invites a paranormal expert to go to Sunshine's house, but the expert turns out to be LeMaster. Nolan's voices tell Nolan that LeMaster is evil and is after Sunshine because of her \"luiseach\" powers. Nolan, terrified and desperate of protecting Sunshine, shoots LeMaster, who at first appears dead. Suddenly he stands up and threatens Sunshine with a demonic voice. Nolan and LeMaster both disappear.\n\nNolan begins to appear and disappear in Sunshine's house. Sunshine searches for any evidence that Nolan really existed, but even Nolan's grandmother does not remember him. Sunshine returns to the photograph of the warehouse and finds a hidden message reading \"3 a.m.\". At 3 AM, Sunshine, her mother, and Uncle Tommy go to the warehouse, where they meet Victoria. Victoria tells Sunshine that Nolan is an awaken - a person that had a Near Death Experience and after that has paranormal abilities such as Astral projection. She then tells Sunshine after they find Nolan that her father was a luiseach, but he turned over to the Markons and turned evil.\n\nSunshine finds an 8 mm film in her garden. This film shows a girl being sacrificed by a strange man and a woman Sunshine recognizes as Victoria. The season ends with Sunshine meeting the ghost-girl Anna. She removes the bag from Anna's head, finally revealing that she is the sacrificed girl from the film.\n\nVictoria suddenly shows up to ask Sunshine if she still trusts her. Sunshine answers: \"Not really.\" Despite that Victoria gives the ceremonial knife to Sunshine and asks her to sacrifice her once she has to. Then one night Sunshine hears her mother screaming and Sunshine went downstairs and Victoria showed up telling Sunshine that she needs to know the difference between what is real and what is paranormal. Later, Victoria introduces Sunshine to a man that is claimed to be her mentor. Sunshine experiences lots of paranormal activity. Nolan visits Sunshine's house and tells her that he had a dream when Sunshine's father had a demon on a leash and he kept on repeating, \"We're coming to get you!\" A third ghost shows itself in one of her videos. She has a white dress and her hair is almost completely over her face. The paranormal activity in the house is getting worse, and in one video Uncle Tommy spit up that compost again and was bleeding from his face. Victoria comes and says that she wants to do another ritual (the first ritual was the sacrifice) but this one involves burning the house down. Sunshine has also confirmed that they are moving. Victoria returns and tells Sunshine that she was not a Luiseach but a normal teenage girl (which may be hinted that Sunshine's powers were possibly removed for her safety). The Markons had decided to forget about Anna and she did not need Sunshine's help any more. The seasons ends with Sunshine and her mom moving out of the house.\n\nFor Sunshine's high school graduation, her mother decides to take her to a \"haunted\" cabin in the woods. They stay in the cabin for a few days and they start experiencing paranormal activity going on. Sunshine then finds a guest book to the house that contains a name that says that the ghost wants his dog Rex. They later on go outside and they find a metal gold box that contains the dog, Rex in it. It turns out that Rex is a stuffed animal dog. Later on they leave the house for a little bit to get away from the ghost. They come home and the dog is on a bed upstairs. A few nights later the lights go out and there is crazy stuff happening. The boy was not found but he touched Sunshine. Then they leave.\n\nIn this less spooky, more humorous season, Sunshine meets Nolan's mom, who says that she knows of a haunted house that Sunshine should check out. Also, the \"paranormal investigators\" from The Investigation of Haunting of Sunshine Girl keep calling her. They meet up at the haunted river house and they check it out but not that much happens. At the end they do however find out what causes the so-called hauntings.\n\nSunshine and her mom Kat have moved to a different house, but they are still experiencing paranormal phenomena; voices coming from the ventilation system and kitchen drawers opening by themselves. When Sunshine visits Nolan in his new apartment, the ghost seems to have followed her there. In one episode the haunting is more intense than in previous seasons and episodes, and Kat is briefly possessed. Sunshine discovers that the ghost speaks Latin.\n\nIn this Halloween special, Sunshine girl, Kat and Nolan visit a haunted house. When they arrive, they find the door open, with a note indicating that the owner have fled from the house. They go inside anyway and look around, which turns out to be a bad idea, especially for Nolan.\n\nSince the Halloween events, Nolan is missing. Sunshine is worried about him and starts to investigate. She meets Nolan's brother Colin, who is also looking for Nolan. She tricks Nolan in showing up, using some psychology, after which Nolan and Colin become rivals for Sunshine's friendship. In the meantime minor paranormal activity takes place - Anna the ghost is playing with the lights and the Latin speaking ghost makes himself heard - but the focus of this season is on Nolan's and Sunshine's friendship.\n\nSeason 10 is much longer than the previous seasons, and consists of 86 episodes. The seasons can be broken up into different parts, set in different locations, but all having the same underlying theme; Sunshine learning about ghosts and learning to control and use her luiseach powers. The first part it set in Sunshine’s home, where paranormal activities are more prominent than before. The second part is set at the haunted house of a couple, Jamie and Patrick, who are not telling the whole truth. In the third part Sunshine and Nolan visit the haunted recording and sound editing studio of Marc, where they experience very strange and frightening phenomena. The fourth part is mostly set at Sunshine’s home again, followed by a part where Victoria takes her to a training house to further develop her skills. In the final part Sunshine, Nolan and uncle Tommy set out to find Sunshine’s father, which leads to a dramatic climax.\n\nIn this section, Sunshine Girl posts videos of paranormal activity that have been sent by fans or that she has found on the internet. The videos include popular myths and urban legends such as Black Eyed Kids or Slender-man.\n\nThe Investigation of The Haunting of Sunshine Girl (included in season #5) is a video uploaded on 5/16/12 which is 14:15 long (filmed on March 10, 2012). A paranormal team tries to prove if Sunshine's ghost videos are real or a hoax. After a night of terrifying paranormal activity, the investigators flee the house.\n\n\nIn December 2010 Hagen approached actress Mercedes Rose with the idea to create a paranormal web-based show, as he noted that the word \"ghost\" was a common search term. Rose later described the idea as \"\"Gilmore Girls\" meets \"Paranormal Activity\" with a little \"Easy A\" thrown in.\" The show would be unscripted and center around a \"girl trying to prove her house is haunted\". Hagen and Rose then enlisted Rose's daughter, Kat McKenzie, to star as the series's main character. From there the three worked on the series's concept and chose to develop the story as the series progressed, as they \"wanted something that we could keep doing on YouTube but could also be expanded into a bigger \"universe\" with these paranormal rules and characters we’ve set up.\" McKenzie chose to base the character upon herself, as she felt that the channel \"wouldn’t feel genuine if it felt like I was putting on some sort of act.\" McKenzie did not initially reveal her name to viewers until 2013, a move that she later stated was due to fear of stalkers.\n\nMost episodes are filmed with a flip camera by the actors themselves. This filming format was chosen as it would allow them to film multiple episodes at a time, which would make it easier to post new videos each week. Hagen noted that he had to use specific keywords that would allow for the best search-engine optimization, which made it easier for users to find and enable them to have \"100,000 views within weeks\" without having to actively promote the channel. Aside from optimization, McKenzie found that interacting with fans also raised the series's visibility and viewership numbers. Fans can interact with McKenzie via her social media accounts and by sharing videos. The channel became a YouTube Partner in 2011 and during 2014 made $4,000 to $6,000 a month via ads.\n\nIn 2013 McKenzie took part in a scholarship competition in \"Seventeen\" magazine, where she ran under her real name and mentioned \"The Haunting of Sunshine Girl\". This contest attracted the attention of a literary agent, who helped finalize a deal with the Weinstein Company to produce a book and television series based on \"The Haunting of Sunshine Girl\".\n\nSunshine's World is another YouTube channel by Coat Tale Productions. There is no plot. Sunshine Girl just posts videos about her visiting a pumpkin farm, a shop in Portland or showing her posters to the audience. It is the vlog of an 18-year-old girl. The last upload to this channel was March 9, 2018.\n\nIn \"Sunshine Screen Prints,\" Sunshine Girl shows her audience the basics of screen printing.\n\n\"Uncle Tommy's YouTube Confessions\" is the first spin-off based on a supporting character of \"The Haunting of Sunshine Girl\". It is an interactive series in which the audience sends secret confessions via comment or email to \"Uncle Tommy,\" which he and friends might then read on the show. Occasionally Kat or Sunshine Girl appear in Uncle Tommy's videos.\n\nIn November 2011 Coat Tale Productions launched a Kickstarter project to fund a feature film, \"In Search of Black Eyed Kids\" (later retitled \"Sunshine Girl and the Hunt for Black Eyed Kids\"). The film would follow Sunshine and other series characters as they search for black-eyed children, an urban legend surrounding supernatural creatures. The Kickstarter campaign met its goals, but Mercedes Rose later stated that the majority of the funding came from friends, family, and members of their film community.\n\nFilming for \"Sunshine Girl and the Hunt for Black Eyed Kids\" began in January 2012 in Portland, Oregon, and was produced in association with Lyon Films. The movie was released on DVD in December 2012 and is available via download.\n\nIn November 2013 McKenzie launched an Indiegogo project to fund a second feature film, then temporarily titled \"Alone\", and the campaign raised $2,480. The film is set during the 1980s and centers around a girl (played by McKenzie) stuck in a cabin with a ghost. The film's name was later changed to \"Three\" (also stylized as \"Thr33\") and filming commenced in 2014. Thr33 was released on 29 January 2016.\n\nIn 2014 the Weinstein Co. announced that they had closed a multiplatform deal to adapt \"The Haunting of Sunshine Girl\" into a young adult novel and film franchise. On March 24, 2015 \"The Haunting of Sunshine Girl\" was released in hardback, e-book, and audiobook via Weinstein Books, and follows the same plot as the web series's first story arc. Critical reception for the book was mixed, with some outlets criticizing the work for being too similar to other supernatural young adult novels while others praised it for its character interactions and chills.\n\nOn March 1, 2016 the sequel to The \"Haunting of Sunshine Girl\" was released titled \"The Awakening of Sunshine Girl\" in hardback, e-book, and audiobook via Weinstein Books, and like its predecessor had many praises for the scary plot and deep character development and criticism for the lack originality based on other supernatural young adult novels.\n\nThe third and final book, \"The Sacrifice of Sunshine girl\", was released April 4, 2017. The book completed the trilogy and was also based on the hit YouTube channel.\n\nIn March 2015 McKenzie announced that there were plans for the Weinstein Co. to adapt \"The Haunting of Sunshine Girl\" into either a feature film or television show, along with a novel. The following month McKenzie issued a press release stating that it had been decided that they would progress with a television show rather than a film, as they felt that \"TV would be an easier transition.\" The series will be based on the novel released in September 2015 and will have McKenzie in the starring role.\n\n"}

Many Victorian conventions shine through the guides, and are a valuable way of understanding certain tensions in nineteenth century England, such as a certain \"artful artlessness\" that came about as the result of the urge to speak from the heart, but never more than was proper.\n\nA letter’s physical appearance, in addition to content, was a key concern for letter-writing guides. For men, they advocated as plain paper as could be made available, and for women a light spritz of perfume was sometimes acceptable. Other sources, however, disagreed, and suggested high outward ornamentation such as ribbons, flowery drawings, and interesting colors could be used by females, but part of this may have been the date of the guide, as vogue changed by the decade. Earlier in the century, ribbons were very popular, but fashion changed to heavy cream paper in the 1880s and then monogrammed letterheads by the end of the nineteenth century. The manner of sealing the letter also changed over the course of the years. Originally it had been wax wafers and dried gum, but as time went on colored wax became more prevalent, the use of which was dictated by social conventions. Black wax was always associated with mourning, but red wax was to be used in letters between men, particularly those dealing with business, and letters from men to women. Women were free to use a range of colors, no matter the correspondent. Even ink was hotly debated; though all sides agreed on bold black ink, blue was sometimes suggested as an alternative, and all other colors shunned, though most letter-writing guides acknowledged that they had once been in fashion.\n\nLetter writing guides simultaneously advised writing with absolute feeling and being cautious about saying too much, or saying the wrong things, regardless of whether or not these wrong things had real feeling behind them. Many guides cautioned that anyone could read your letters and thereby make inferences about you, even if those who you corresponded with assured you that they burnt your epistles.\n\nThe caution about appearance in letters was doubly stressed in matrimonial letters, even as women and men were encouraged to still write from the heart. Men were warned against complimenting their chosen bride too heavily, as it seemed insincere; rather, their moral traits and the feminine virtue of indifference were set as prime subjects to appreciate in a marriage proposal. Women, meanwhile, were urged not to be too unguarded in their letters, even in the acceptance of a proposal, to only thank and address the man’s moral qualities. Love letters did not end in ‘love,’ but more frequently simply as ‘ever your friend.’\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6743748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6743748", "title": "Vishuddha Siddhanta Panjika", "text": "Vishuddha Siddhanta Panjika\n\nVishuddha Siddhanta Panjika () is a panjika (almanac) that was first published in 1297 Bengali year (1890 AD). Madhab Chandra Chattopadhyay of the Bengal of undivided India was the first editor.\n\nThe 19th century Bengali almanacs that gave details of tithi, nakshatra, etc. were generally not in conformity with the position of planets. A true panjika has to tally with the scientific observation. To meet this end, prominent astrologers of that time — almanac reformist of Orissa Mahamahopadhyay Chandrashekhar Sinha Samanta, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak of Pune, Western India, scriptural scholars like Bapudev Shastri and Ketkar, experts from Kashi like Madan Mohan Malaviya, Maha mahopadhyay Maheshchandra Nyayaratna, Sasadhar Tarkachudamani, Acharya Yogesh Chandra Roy Vidyanidhi of Bengal — advised the publication of \"Vishuddha Siddhanta Almanac\".\n\n\"Vishuddha Siddhanta Almanac\" is recognized by scholars of scriptures such as Deshikottama Dr Srijiv Nyayaratna, mathematics scholar Nirmal Chandra Lahiri, internationally known scientist Prof Megh Nad Saha, et al.\n\nThis almanac is approved and followed by Sankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi matha, Sri Tarakeshwar Math, worldwide Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, Satsanga Ashrama of Deoghar and other religious organisations.\n\nThe calculations of the almanac are fully done with the help of computers to show the accuracy of the renderings and, therefore, the timing of the puja and parvan for occasions are free from any mistake. Hence the Indian national calendar (Rashtriya Panchang) published by the Government of India fully tallies with the almanac.\n\nHowever, the traditional school also has its validity. Jyotish Shastra is not astronomy, and it is based on the words of Parashara, Garga, Mantreshwara who never used computers or western astronomy. Further, the planetary positions of Jyotish-nakshatra, rashi-or rahu, Ketu etc. depend more on belief and assumptions than science.\n\n\"Vishuddha Siddhanta Panjika\" provides articles on astrology and astronomy; annual predictions for the nation on subjects ranging from agriculture to politics; predictions on individual lagnas; and annual predictions on the basis of birth-stars. There are other regular sections like vedic months and dates from the Indian national calendar.\n\nDaily declination of the Sun, equation of time, sidereal time, planetary aspects, correct times of the eclipses, rising and setting times of the moon in different places, rising and setting times of the sun in Kolkata and seven other cities, monthly description of the night sky and locations of the stars and planets with explanatory sky maps are given. The dates of the main celebrations for the coming year are mentioned. An important addition is the dates of birth and death of many savants and saints of India irrespective of denominational adherence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "153959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153959", "title": "Wax museum", "text": "Wax museum\n\nA wax museum or waxworks usually consists of a collection of wax sculptures representing famous people from history and contemporary personalities exhibited in lifelike poses, wearing real clothes.\n\nSome wax museums have a special section dubbed the \"Chamber of Horrors\", in which the more grisly exhibits are displayed. Some collections are more specialized, as, for example, collections of wax medical models once used for training medical professionals. Many museums or displays in historical houses that are not wax museums as such use wax figures as part of their displays. The origin of wax museums goes back to the early 18th century at least, and wax funeral effigies of royalty and some other figures exhibited by their tombs had essentially been tourist attractions well before that.\n\nThe making of life-size wax figures wearing real clothes grew out of the funeral practices of European royalty. In the Middle Ages it was the habit to carry the corpse, fully dressed, on top of the coffin at royal funerals, but this sometimes had unfortunate consequences in hot weather, and the custom of making an effigy in wax for this role grew, again wearing actual clothes so that only the head and hands needed wax models. After the funeral these were often displayed by the tomb or elsewhere in the church, and became a popular attraction for visitors, which it was often necessary to pay to view.\n\nThe museum of Westminster Abbey in London has a collection of British royal wax effigies going back to that of Edward III of England (died 1377), as well as those of figures such as the naval hero Horatio Nelson, and Frances Stewart, Duchess of Richmond, who also had her parrot stuffed and displayed. From the funeral of Charles II in 1680 they were no longer placed on the coffin but were still made for later display. The effigy of Charles II, open-eyed and standing, was displayed over his tomb until the early 19th century, when all the Westminster effigies were removed from the abbey itself. Nelson's effigy was a pure tourist attraction, commissioned the year after his death in 1805, and his burial not in the Abbey but in St Paul's Cathedral after a government decision that major public figures should in future be buried there. Concerned for their revenue from visitors, the Abbey decided it needed a rival attraction for admirers of Nelson.\nIn European courts including that of France the making of posed wax figures became popular. Antoine Benoist (1632–1717) was a French court painter and sculptor in wax to King Louis XIV. He exhibited forty-three wax figures of the French \"Royal Circle\" at his residence in Paris. Thereafter, the king authorized the figurines to be shown throughout France. His work became so highly regarded that James II of England invited him to visit England in 1684. There he executed works of the English king and members of his court. A seated figure of Peter the Great of Russia survives, made by an Italian artist, after the Tsar was impressed by the figures he saw at the Chateau of Versailles. The Danish court painter Johann Salomon Wahl executed figures of the Danish king and queen in about 1740.\n\nThe 'Moving Wax Works of the Royal Court of England', a museum or exhibition of 140 life-size figures, some apparently with clockwork moving parts, opened by Mrs Mary in Fleet Street in London was doing excellent business in 1711. Philippe Curtius, waxwork modeller to the French court, opened his \"Cabinet de Cire\" as a tourist attraction in Paris in 1770, which remained open until 1802. In 1783 this added a \"Caverne des Grandes Voleurs\" (\"Cave of the Great Thieves\"), an early \"Chamber of Horrors\". He bequeathed his collection to his protegé Marie Tussaud, who during the French Revolution made death masks of the executed royals.\n\nMadame Tussauds, historically associated with London, is the most famous name associated with wax museums, although it was not the earliest wax museum, as is sometimes thought. In 1835 Madame Tussaud established her first permanent exhibition in London's Baker Street. By the late 19th century most large cities had some kind of commercial wax museum, like the Musée Grévin in Paris or the Panoptikum Hamburg, and for a century these remained highly popular. In the late 20th century it became harder for them to compete with other attractions.\n\nToday there are also Madame Tussauds in Dam Square, Amsterdam; Berlin; Madame Tussauds Hong Kong; Shanghai; and five locations in the United States: the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, Times Square in New York City, Washington, D.C., Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco and Hollywood.\n\nLouis Tussaud's wax museum in San Antonio, Texas, is across the street from the historic Alamo. Others are located on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, and Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\nOne of the most popular wax museums in the United States for decades was The Movieland Wax Museum in Buena Park, California, near Knott's Berry Farm. The museum opened in 1962 and through the years added many wax figures of famous show business figures. Several stars attended the unveilings of the wax incarnations. The museum closed its doors on October 31, 2005, after years of dwindling attendance.\n\nHowever, the most enduring museum in the United States is the Hollywood Wax Museum located in Hollywood, California which features almost exclusively figures of movie actors displayed in settings associated with their roles in popular movies. This group of museums includes Hollywood Wax Museum Branson in Branson, Missouri along with Hollywood Wax Museum Pigeon Forge in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee and Hollywood Wax Museum Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. With the original location having been developed in the mid-1960s, the most recent reports suggest that this group of museums is experiencing brisk business with the Branson location having undergone a substantial expansion and remodeling in 2008 and 2009 including an animated ride and a mirror maze.\n\nAnother popular wax museum is the Musée Conti Wax Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana, which features wax figures portraying the city's history as well as a \"Haunted Dungeon\" section of wax figures of famous characters from horror films and literature. This museum is currently closed as the Conti building is being converted into condos. The museum should reopen at Jazzland Theme Park some time in the future. Another popular wax museum in the U.S. is the Wax Museum at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, California.\n\nBibleWalk is a Christian wax museum in Mansfield, Ohio. It has received attention for its use of celebrity wax figures in its religious scenes, originally a cost-saving measure when new wax figures were deemed too expensive.\n\nThe Royal London Wax Museum was open in downtown Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, from 1970 to 2010 in the Steamship Terminal building, it featured \"royalty to rogues and the renowned.\" It was forced to close when the building required seismic upgrades.\n\nThe National Wax Museum in Dublin, Ireland is a wax museum which hosts well over a hundred figures. For many years it has had only one sculptor, PJ Heraty, who continued producing figures even while the museum was closed. Meanwhile, it could be re-opened at a new location. During the last few years some other new wax museums are starting around the world. In 2009 Dreamland Wax Museum opened in Gramado, in the south of Brazil.\n\nThe National Presidential Wax Museum in Keystone, South Dakota is the only wax museum in the world to feature every U.S. President. Their exhibits also include other notable figures from history such as General George Custer, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and Sitting Bull. Originally created by the famed sculptress Katherine Stubergh, the museum includes death and life masks of notable Hollywood celebrities including Mae West Sid Grauman.

Adults live in the ocean, at depths to , while juveniles live in estuaries. The rostrum is moderately long, with 7–10 teeth on the dorsal side and two to four teeth on the ventral side.\n\nWhiteleg shrimp are native to the eastern Pacific Ocean, from the Mexican state of Sonora to as far south as northern Peru. It is restricted to areas where the water temperatures remain above throughout the year.\n\nDuring the 20th century, \"L. vannamei\" was an important species for Mexican inshore fishermen, as well as for trawlers further offshore. In the late 20th century, the wild fishery was overtaken by the use of aquaculture; this began in 1973 in Florida using prawns captured in Panama. In Latin America, the culture of \"L. vannamei\" showed peaks of production during the warm El Niño years, and reduced production during the cooler La Niña years, due to the effects of disease. Production of \"L. vannamei\" is limited by its susceptibility to various diseases, including white spot syndrome, Taura syndrome, infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis, baculoviral midgut gland necrosis, and \"Vibrio\" infections. By 2004, global production of \"L. vannamei\" approached 1,116,000 t, and exceeded that of \"Penaeus monodon\".\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International has added the whiteleg shrimp to its seafood red list. This lists fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries. The reasons given by Greenpeace were \"destruction of vast areas of mangroves in several countries, overfishing of juvenile shrimp from the wild to supply shrimp farms, and significant human rights abuses\".\n\n"}
