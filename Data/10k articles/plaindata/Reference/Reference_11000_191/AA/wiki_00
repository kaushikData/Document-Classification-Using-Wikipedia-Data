S. Yeoman, is a pricing guide for United States coin collectors and is considered one of the most authoritative coin price sources.\n\nEditor R. S. Yeoman was the editor until he retired in 1970.\n\nIn 1971 his assistant, Kenneth Bressett, took over as the editor of the Blue Book and Red Book until he retired in 2017.\n\nIn 2018 Jeff Garrett, former ANA president, took over and assumed the post as senior editor, and still holds that position.\n\nYeoman is still listed as the author of each edition of the books, and Bressett is listed as editor emeritus.\n\nThe book is the longest running coin price guide. The first edition, dated 1947, went on sale November 1946. After the first three editions (dated 1947, 1948, 1949), the \"Guide Book\" was not published in 1949; annual publication resumed in 1950 with the 4th edition (dated 1951–1952) and has continued to this day. The book's all-time peak print run for a single year was 1.2 million copies in 1965. The 70th edition, cover-dated 2017, was published in 2016.\n\nThe \"Red Book\" lists the retail value of all United States coins from Colonial and pre-federal State Issues to all circulating issues, as well as commemorative and modern-day bullion coins, as well as other significant U.S. patterns, private and territorial gold, Hard-times tokens, Confederate issues, Hawaiian tokens and coins, Philippine issues and Alaskan tokens. It also shows Issue Prices and Current Values of mint sets and proof sets.\n\nThe values are divided by main coin grades.\nThe \"Guide Book\" got its \"Red Book\" nickname due to the book's solid red cover. \n\nIn addition to the traditional hardcover edition, new formats have been added through the years:\n\nEarly editions of the \"Red Book\" are collectible. The first edition has commanded $1,500 or more on the open market. \nThe \"Red Book\" has its own \"Red Book\" – A Guide Book Of The Official Red Book Of United States Coins by Frank J. Colletti published 2009 by Whitman Publishing ().\n\nA facsimile of the 1947 edition was published in 2006, on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the first edition. Dubbed the \"1947 Tribute Edition\" (), it differs from the original by having a dust jacket (the first \"Red Book\" ever to have one) and an additional 32-page color section, comparing the coin collecting hobby in 1946 and 2006. Except for the dust jacket and color section, it was an exact replica of the first printing (with the phrase \"scarcity of this date\" on page 135).\n\n"}

It was commissioned by the American businessman and philanthropist Sidney Frank (1919–2006).\n\nThe slate for the sculpture was selected from North Wales because the sculptor learned that Turing used to holiday there as a child and adult. The slate originated from Llechwedd, near Blaenau Ffestiniog. Turing is depicted seated and looking at a German Enigma machine. He is dressed in a jacket, but there is some deliberate untidiness in his clothing.\n\nIn 2007, it was commented that the statue acknowledges Turing as a codebreaker but not as a gay icon. The statue became part of a new exhibition at Bletchley Park on Alan Turing in 2012, the centenary year of Turing's birth. Sir John Dermot Turing, nephew of Alan Turing, attended the opening of the exhibition and posed with the statue.\n\n\n"}

It grew to become arguably the most highly respected sport photo agency in the world, and its photographers won numerous awards until acquisition by Getty Images in 1998.\n\nUntil 1968 Tony Duffy was an accountant and part-time photographer who shot track and field athletics in his spare time. He paid for himself to go to the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City.\n\nAt the 1968 Olympic Games, Bob Beamon broke the World Record in the Long Jump with a leap of 8m 90 or 29 ft 2½ inches. Crouched at the end of the long jump pit was Tony Duffy. Duffy took a picture which, through wide re-production, is perhaps the definitive shot of this remarkable jump.\nThe Allsport agency was founded on the strength of his photograph of Beamon.\n\nTony Duffy was joined in the 1970s by photographers John Starr, Don Morley, and in 1971, Steve Powell. Powell would go on to become Group Managing Director. Morley specialised in shooting motorsport, specifically motorbikes, and Starr took studio shots. Adrian Murrell joined in the mid seventies and became the agency's Cricket specialist. Duffy's innovative feature 'Sport and the Body' brought his name and the name of the agency to a wider audience when published by the Sunday Times in 1973. The use of naked sports stars caused uproar and brought nationwide publicity.\n\nThe Allsport agency experienced tremendous growth throughout the 1980s, and in 1983 Tony Duffy moved to California to open the Allsport USA offices in Santa Monica. In 1985 he was joined by Mike Powell, the younger brother of Steve. David Cannon joined in 1982 as a general sport photographer specialising in football and golf. With Duffy working stateside, Bob Martin assumed the role of leading athletics photographer in Europe. Younger photographers such as Mike King, Simon Bruty, Gray Mortimore, Mike Stahlschmidt, Jonathan Daniel and Pascal Rondeau continued to create stunning and thought-provoking sport images.\n\nIn 1988 Allsport was appointed as Official Photographer to the International Olympic Committee. The first book in the Visions of Sport series was published to celebrate 20 years of Allsport, and included all of the famous images shot by Allsport photographers in its first 20 years.\n"}

With archives covering a shelf-length of about 50 kilometres, the Amsterdam City Archives is the largest municipal archive in the world.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Amsterdam’s important documents were stored in a special cabinet that was kept in the so-called ‘Iron Chapel’ (IJzeren Kapel) in the Old Church (Oude Kerk). In the nineteenth century, the archives moved to the Waag building at the Nieuwmarkt, and in 1914 to the former town hall of Nieuwer-Amstel. Since the summer of 2007, the Amsterdam City Archives have been located in the monumental building De Bazel, in the city-centre, which derives its name from the famous Dutch architect K.P.C. de Bazel, who designed it.\n\nThe Amsterdam City Archives belongs to the government of Amsterdam. It preserves the archives of the municipal government and of the national government when related to Amsterdam, besides those of private institutions, families or individuals, and companies connected with the city. The municipalities of Ouder-Amstel and Amstelveen have also deposited their historical archives at the Amsterdam City Archives. In addition, the City Archives houses a large collection of images and audio-visual material, as well as a library.\n\nAmong the various documents of international significance kept at the Amsterdam City Archives are the archives of the Heineken brewery and the renowned Concertgebouw, letters written by Charles Darwin and Mahatma Gandhi, an eighteenth-century trade agreement between the city and the newly founded United States of America, the book containing the excommunication of seventeenth-century philosopher Spinoza, and a police report about the theft of Anne Frank’s bike, dated April 13, 1942.\n\nThe Amsterdam City Archives also monitors the way the various departments within Amsterdam’s administrative structure manage their archives, ensuring that documents that are of significance for the city’s history are maintained.\n\nArchival material is made available for consultation both on site and through the internet. In recent years, many documents have been digitized. The website of the Amsterdam City Archives features an Image Bank, containing more than 260.000 photos, drawings, and prints related to the city, and an Archives Database, providing scans of archival material on request, including a wealth of sources for genealogical research, accessible through several indexes. These scans now number more than seven million.\n\nThe Amsterdam City Archives also shares the available expertise on Amsterdam and its history through publications and events. The Archives regularly presents temporary exhibitions, while noteworthy documents are on permanent display in the so-called Treasury (Schatkamer). Historical films about Amsterdam are shown in a small movie theatre.\n\n"}

It may be used outside the CEN area as well. The main difference that exists between EN 14214 standards of different countries is the national annex detailing climate related requirements of biodiesel in different CEN member countries.\n\nOther international standards published by ASTM International include:\n\nThere are also DIN standards for three different varieties of biodiesel, which are made of different oils:\n\nThe National Standards of Canada for biodiesel are published by the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB):\n\nThe standards ensure that the following important factors in the fuel production process are satisfied:\n\nBasic industrial tests to determine whether the products conform to the standards typically include gas chromatography, a test that verifies only the more important of the variables above. Tests that are more complete are more expensive. Fuel meeting the quality standards is very non-toxic, with a toxicity rating () of greater than 50 mL/kg.\n\nASTM International has approved a new specification for diesel fuel blends containing 6%-20% biodiesel. According to the National Biodiesel Board (NBB), ASTM standards for the 20% biodiesel blends, or B20, are a crucial hurdle for the full acceptance of the use of such blends in diesel vehicles. In 2008, ASTM published new Biodiesel Blend Specifications.\n\nWith the new specification in place, automakers and engine manufacturers can test B20 in their diesel engines and know that consumers will be fueling their vehicle with a fuel of the same quality. Currently, Chrysler LLC supports the use of B20 in its Dodge Ram diesel pickups, but only for use in fleets. Likewise, General Motors Corporation accepts the use of 5% biodiesel blends, or B5, in all its vehicles, but limits the use of B20 to special equipment options available only to government fleets in a limited selection of vehicles. While setting the new B20 standard, ASTM International also made changes to its specifications for B5 and for 100% biodiesel, or B100.\nThe FTC will require pumps with biodiesel blends to carry a blue label, while biomass-based diesel blends will carry an orange label. The somewhat confusing \"small print\" was required by the energy act.\nCredit: Federal Trade Commission\nEngine warranty concerns also came into play in a recent effort to create labeling requirements for diesel fuels containing renewable fuel blends. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to set labeling requirements that address the blending of biodiesel and other types of biomass-based diesel fuels into diesel fuel. Some companies are converting biomass such as animal fats directly into a liquid with the properties of diesel fuel, a product that blurs the lines between biodiesel and diesel fuel. At first, the FTC proposed to treat all renewable diesel fuels the same, but the NBB warned that not all biomass-based diesel fuels would necessarily meet the ASTM standards required by automakers for diesel fuels. On the other hand, biomass-based diesel fuels that meet ASTM standards could be used in much higher concentrations than biodiesel, which is usually limited to 20% biodiesel blends for standard diesel vehicles. Considering those comments, the FTC decided to set separate labeling requirements for biodiesel blends and biomass-based diesel fuel blends.\n"}

It can be used in shell scripts and batch files. The command is also available in the open source MS-DOS emulator DOSBox and in the EFI shell. The command is named in MPE/iX.\n\nThe system call that affects the command in most operating systems is that is defined by POSIX.\nThe command is analogous to the OpenVOS command.\n\nA directory is a logical section of a file system used to hold files. Directories may also contain other directories. The command can be used to change into a subdirectory, move back into the parent directory, move all the way back to the root directory or move to any given directory.\n\nConsider the following subsection of a Unix filesystem, which shows a user's home directory (represented as ) with a file, , and three subdirectories.\n\nIf the user's current working directory is the home directory (), then entering the command codice_1 followed by might produce the following transcript:\n\nThe user is now in the \"games\" directory.\n\nA similar session in DOS (though the concept of a \"home directory\" may not apply, depending on the specific version) would look like this:\n\nDOS maintains separate working directories for each lettered drive, and also has the concept of a current working drive. The command can be used to change the working directory of the working drive or another lettered drive. Typing the drive letter as a command on its own changes the working drive, e.g. ; alternatively, with the switch may be used to change the working drive and that drive's working directory in one step.\nModern versions of Windows simulate this behaviour for backwards compatibility under CMD.EXE.\n\nNote that executing from the command line with no arguments has different effects in different operating systems. For example, if is executed without arguments in DOS, OS/2, or Windows, the current working directory is displayed (equivalent to Unix codice_2). If is executed without arguments in Unix, the user is returned to the home directory.\n\nExecuting the command within a script or batch file also has different effects in different operating systems. In DOS, the caller's current directory can be directly altered by the batch file's use of this command. In Unix, the caller's current directory is not altered by the script's invocation of the command. This is because in Unix, the script is usually executed within a subshell.\n\nCommand line shells on Windows usually use the Windows API to change the current working directory, whereas on Unix systems calls the POSIX C function. This means that when the command is executed, no new process is created to migrate to the other directory as is the case with other commands such as ls. Instead, the shell itself executes this command. This is because, when a new process is created, child process inherits the directory in which the parent process was created. If the command inherits the parent process' directory, then the objective of the command cd will never be achieved.\n\nWindows PowerShell, Microsoft's object-oriented command line shell and scripting language, executes the command (\"cmdlet\") within the shell's process. However, since PowerShell is based on the .NET Framework and has a different architecture than previous shells, all of PowerShell's cmdlets like ls, rm etc. run in the shell's process. Of course, this is not true for legacy commands which still run in a separate process.\n\n\nIn the File Transfer Protocol, the respective command is spelled in the control stream, but is available as in most client command-line programs. Some clients also have the for changing the working directory locally.\n\nThe command also pertains to command-line interpreters of various application software.\n\n\n"}

Each text is edited on the basis of all (or the most important of all) the extant manuscripts according to modern editorial techniques, in order to produce a text as close as possible to the original. Each volume includes an introduction, in which the principles of the preparation of the text are explained. \nSome editions are prepared by the staff of the CSEL, others by external, internationally renowned experts; the volumes are published after a positive evaluation by an international advisory board; the publisher is De Gruyter (prior to 2012: Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften). The CSEL also runs the online database Edenda, where CSEL editions as well as editing projects by others are publicly announced.\nIn addition, the CSEL publishes special catalogues for the large extant corpus of medieval manuscripts containing works of Augustine or ascribed to him (\"Die handschriftliche Überlieferung der Werke des heiligen Augustinus\"), in order to make time-consuming research in this field easier. In addition, monographs on topics related to the Latin patristic period and conference proceedings are published at irregular intervals (\"CSEL Extra seriem\").\n\nThe CSEL was founded in 1864 by the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna (Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften) in order to produce critical editions of Latin patristic texts – editions that were meant to facilitate the lexicographical work of the Thesaurus linguae Latinae (at that time still in the planning stages).

These volumes have replaced about a third of J. P. Migne’s Patrologia Latina, which do not offer critical editions. Some CSEL volumes have themselves been replaced by more recent critical editions (e.g., Corpus Christianorum Series Latina, Sources chrétiennes, Bibliothèque augustinienne), but about two-thirds of them are still considered authoritative standard editions; in fact, the CSEL edition often remains the only critical edition of a given text.\nIn the course of work on the manuscript catalogues as well as on the preparation of CSEL editions, patristic texts which were previously thought lost have been recovered: e.g., the writings of the Spanish heretic Priscillian, the commentary on Revelation by Victorinus of Pettau, 29 unknown letters of Augustine (\"Epistulae Divjak\"), six of Augustine’s sermons (\"Sermones Erfurt\"), and the full text of the commentary on the gospels by Fortunatianus of Aquileia (mid-4th century; edition published 2017).

The current version is the CPT 2018. It is available in both a standard edition and a professional edition.\n\nCPT coding is similar to ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding, except that it identifies the services rendered, rather than the diagnosis on the claim (ICD-10-CM was created for diagnostic coding- it took the place of Volume 3 of the ICD-9). The ICD code sets also contain procedure codes (ICD-10-PCS codes), but these are only used in the inpatient setting.\n\nCPT is currently identified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as Level 1 of the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System.\n\nThe Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) was developed by the American Medical Association (AMA).\n\nThere are three types of CPT code: Category I, Category II, and Category III.\n\nCategory I CPT Code(s). There are six main sections:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPT II codes describe clinical components usually included in evaluation and management or clinical services and are not associated with any relative value. Category II codes are reviewed by the Performance Measures Advisory Group (PMAG), an advisory body to the CPT Editorial Panel and the CPT/HCPAC Advisory Committee. The PMAG is composed of performance measurement experts representing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the American Medical Association (AMA), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement. The PMAG may seek additional expertise and/or input from other national health care organizations, as necessary, for the development of Category II codes. These may include national medical specialty societies, other national health care professional associations, accrediting bodies and federal regulatory agencies.\n\nCategory II codes make use of an alphabetical character as the 5th character in the string (i.e., 4 digits followed by the letter F). These digits are not intended to reflect the placement of the code in the regular (Category I) part of the CPT codebook. Appendix H in CPT section contains information about performance measurement exclusion of modifiers, measures, and the measures' source(s). Currently there are 11 Category II codes.

The AMA holds the copyright for the CPT coding system. However, in \"Practice Management v. American Medical Association\" the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that while the AMA owned the copyright, it could not enjoin a competitor on the basis that the AMA had misused its copyright.

He indicts both Lord Alfred's vanity and his own weakness in acceding to those wishes. In the second half, Wilde charts his spiritual development in prison and identification with Jesus Christ, whom he characterises as a romantic, individualist artist. The letter began \"Dear Bosie\" and ended \"Your Affectionate Friend\".\n\nWilde wrote the letter between January and March 1897, close to the end of his imprisonment. Contact had lapsed between Douglas and Wilde and the latter had suffered from his close supervision, physical labour, and emotional isolation. Nelson, the new prison governor, thought that writing might be more cathartic than prison labour. He was not allowed to send the long letter which he was allowed to write \"for medicinal purposes\"; each page was taken away when completed, and only at the end could he read it over and make revisions. Nelson gave the long letter to him on his release on 18 May 1897.\n\nWilde entrusted the manuscript to the journalist Robert Ross (another former lover, loyal friend and rival to \"Bosie\"). Ross published the letter in 1905, five years after Wilde's death, giving it the title \"De Profundis\" from Psalm 130. It was an incomplete version, excised of its autobiographical elements and references to the Queensberry family; various editions gave more text until in 1962 the complete and correct version appeared in a volume of Wilde's letters.\n\nIn 1891 Wilde began an intimate friendship with Lord Alfred Douglas, a young, vain aristocrat. As the two grew closer, family and friends on both sides urged Wilde and Douglas to lessen their contact. Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, often feuded with his son over the topic. Especially after the suicide death of his eldest son, the Viscount Drumlanrig, Queensberry privately accused them of improper acts and threatened to cut off Lord Alfred's allowance. When they refused, he began publicly harassing Wilde. In early 1895 Wilde had reached the height of his fame and success with his plays \"An Ideal Husband\" and \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" on stage in London. When Wilde returned from holidays after the premieres, he found Queensberry's card at his club with the inscription: \"For Oscar Wilde, posing somdomite\".\n\nUnable to bear further insults and encouraged by Lord Alfred (who wanted to attack his father in every possible way), Wilde sued Queensberry for criminal libel. Wilde withdrew his claim as the defence began but the Judge deemed that Queensberry's accusation was justified. The Crown promptly issued a warrant for his arrest and he was charged with gross indecency with other men under the Labouchere Amendment in April 1895. The trial was the centre of public discussion as details of Wilde's consorts from the working class became known. Wilde refused to admit wrongdoing and the jury were unable to reach a verdict. At the retrial Wilde was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, to be held to hard labour.\n\nHe was imprisoned in Pentonville, Wandsworth, and Reading Prisons, where the poor food, manual labour, and harsh conditions greatly weakened his health. He quickly began suffering from hunger, insomnia, and disease. He was visited in Pentonville by R. B. S. Haldane, a liberal, reforming MP whom he had known before. Haldane championed his case and arranged for access to religious, educational, and historical books. Whilst in Wandsworth Wilde collapsed in the Chapel and burst his right ear drum, an injury that would later contribute to his death. He spent two months recovering in the infirmary. Friends arranged for him to be transferred to Reading Prison, where he was prescribed lighter duties and allowed to spend some time reading but not writing. Depressed, he was unable to complete even these duties, and under Colonel Isaacson, the strict Warden of Reading Prison, Wilde became trapped in a series of harsh punishments for trivial offences. The failure to complete them led to renewed sanction.\n\nWilde, who still loved Lord Alfred, became upset as contact from him became rare, then annoyed when he learned that the latter planned to publish Wilde's letters without permission and dedicate poems to him unasked. He wrote to friends immediately, forbidding the former and refusing the latter. Wilde still maintained his belief that the Queensberrys owed him a debt of honour arising from his bankruptcy trial.\n\nWilde's friends continued pressing for better conditions and, in 1897, Major Nelson, a man of a more progressive mind, replaced Col. Isaacson as Warden. He quickly visited Wilde and offered him a book from his personal library, the sympathy bringing Wilde to tears. Soon Wilde requested lists of books, returning to Ancient Greek poets and Christian theology, and studying modern Italian and German, though it was Dante's \"Inferno\" that held his attention.\n\nWilde was granted official permission to have writing materials in early 1897, but even then under strict control: he could write to his friends and his solicitor, but only one page at a time. Wilde decided to write a letter to Douglas, and in it discuss the last five years they had spent together, creating an autobiography of sorts. Wilde spent January, February, and March 1897 writing his letter. Textual analysis of the manuscript shows that Nelson probably relaxed the stringent rules, allowing Wilde to see the papers together: three of the sheets are of relatively fair copy, suggesting they were entirely re-written, and most do not end with a full-stop. Wilde requested that he might send the letter to Lord Alfred Douglas or Robert Ross, which the Home Office denied, but he was permitted to take it with him on release.<ref name=\"Holland/Hart-Davis 2000 683\">Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:683)</ref> Wilde never revised the work after he left prison.\n\nWilde's work was written as a prose letter on twenty sheets of prison paper. It contains no formal divisions (save paragraphs) and is addressed and signed off as a letter. Scholars have distinguished a noticeable change in style, tone and content in the latter half of the letter, when Wilde addresses his spiritual journey in prison. In the first part, Wilde examines the time he and Lord Alfred had spent together, from 1892 until Wilde's trials in the spring of 1895. He examines Lord Alfred's behaviour and its detrimental effect on Wilde's work, and recounts Lord Alfred's constant demands on his attention and hospitality. Poignancy builds throughout this section as Wilde details the expenses of their sumptuous dinners and hotel-stays, many costing over £1,000; it culminates in an account of Douglas's rage in Brighton whilst Wilde was ill. Though he was a constant presence at Wilde's side, their relationship was intellectually sterile. Throughout Wilde's self-accusation is that he acceded to these demands instead of placing himself within quiet, intellectual company dedicated to the contemplation of beauty and ideas, but instead succumbed to an \"imperfect world of coarse uncompleted passions, of appetite without distinction, desire without limit, and formless greed\". This passage concludes with Wilde offering his forgiveness to Douglas. He repudiates him for what Wilde finally sees as his arrogance and vanity; he had not forgotten Douglas's remark, when he was ill, \"When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.\"\n\nThe second part of the letter traces Wilde's spiritual growth through the physical and emotional hardships of his imprisonment. Wilde introduces the greater context, making a typically grandiose claim: \"I was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age\", though he later writes, in a more humble vein, \"I have said of myself that I was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age. There is not a single wretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in symbolic relation to the very secret of life. For the secret of life is suffering.\" Briefly sketching his ascendancy and dominance of the literary and social scenes in London, he contrasts his past position and the attendant pleasure with his current position and the pain it brings. Pleasure and success are an artifice, he says, while pain wears no mask. He turns to humility as a remedy, and identifies with the other prisoners.\n\nWilde uses Isaiah 53:3 to introduce his Christian theme: \"He is despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid our faces from him.\" Though Peter Raby acknowledges the \"obvious relevance\" of this quotation to Wilde's situation, he argues that the line does not necessitate the comparison with Christ implicit in his description of Robert Ross doffing his hat to Wilde after his conviction. Wilde adopts Jesus of Nazareth as a symbol of western kindness and eastern serenity and as a rebel-hero of mind, body and soul. Though other romantics had discussed Jesus in artistic terms, Wilde's conception is the most radical. He moves methodically toward this conclusion: his earlier antinomian attitude is re-iterated and he finds no recompense in traditional morality. Though Wilde loved the beauty of religion, he dismissed it now as a source of solace, saying \"My Gods dwell in temples made with hands\". Reason was similarly lacking: Wilde felt that the law had convicted him unjustly. Instead Wilde reworked his earlier doctrine of the appreciation of experience: all of it must be accepted and transformed, whatever its origin. Wilde declared he would actively accept sorrow and discover humility, be happy and appreciate developments in art and life.\n\nHe also felt redemption and fulfilment in his ordeal, realising that his hardship had filled the soul with the fruit of experience, however bitter it tasted at the time:\n\nSimon Critchley argues that the major element of \"De Profundis\" is self-realisation. Wilde, having lost everything dear to him, does not accuse external forces, justified as this might have been, but rather absorbs his hardships through the artistic process into a spiritual experience.\n\nThough a letter, at 50,000 words long \"De Profundis\" becomes a sort of dramatic monologue which considers Douglas's supposed responses. Wilde's previous prose writing had assumed a flippant, chatty style, which he again employed in his comic plays. In prison Wilde was disconnected from his audiences, which Declan Kiberd suggested was possibly his harshest punishment. He characterises Wilde as an Irish critic of English social mores ultimately silenced for his polemics, and reports that while convalescing in the sick-bay, Wilde entertained his fellow-patients and carers with stories and wit until the authorities placed a warder beside his bed.\n\nIn a preface to the 1905 (and, later, 1912) edition, published as a popular edition by Methuen, Robert Ross, Wilde's literary executor, published an extract from Wilde's instructions to him which included the author's own summation of the work:\n\nAccording to Kiberd, Wilde follows Christ's individualist theme of self-perfection into a testing new zone: prison. Wilde, who had always looked to test English society's hypocrisies, declined the opportunity to flee to France. Kiberd places Wilde within the long tradition of prison writing by Irish Republican prisoners; when Wilde wanted to criticise the penal system after release, he contacted Michael Davitt, an Irish political reformer who had himself been imprisoned in England.\n\nOn his release, Wilde unburdened himself of the manuscript by giving it to Robbie Ross, with the putative title \"Epistola: In Carcere et Vinculis\" (\"Letter: In Prison and in Chains\"), Ross and Reggie Turner met the exiled Wilde on the ferry from England at Dieppe on 20 May 1897. The manuscript comprised eighty close-written pages on twenty folio sheets of thin blue prison paper. Ross was instructed to make two typed copies, one for Wilde himself, and to send the original to Lord Alfred. However, fearing that Douglas would destroy the original, Ross sent him a copy instead (Douglas said at the 1913 Ransome libel trial that he burnt the copy he was sent without reading it). Due to its length, Ross could not have it fully typed until August.\n\nIn 1905, Wilde's contemporary translator to German, Max Meyerfeld, published the first book edition with Samuel Fischer in Berlin which was preceded by a publication in Fischer's monthly magazine \"Neue Rundschau\" (Vol. 16, Nos. 1–2 [Jan.–Febr. 1905]). The book appeared on 11 February 1905 and hence preceded the English edition by Ross by about two weeks. Ross published the letter with the title \"De Profundis\", expurgating all references to the Queensberry family. This edition would go through eight printings in the next three years, including \"de luxe\" editions. The title, meaning \"from the depths\", comes from Psalm 130, \"From the depths, I have cried out to you, O Lord\". In 1924, when Lord Alfred served six months in prison for libel against Winston Churchill, he wrote a sonnet sequence entitled \"In Excelsis\" (\"from the heights\"), intentionally mirroring Wilde's letter.\n\nA second, slightly expanded, version of \"De Profundis\" appeared in the edition of Collected Works of Wilde published by Ross between 1908 and 1922. Also included were three other letters Wilde wrote from Reading Prison and his two letters to the editor of the \"Daily Chronicle\" written after his release. Ross then donated the manuscript to the British Museum on the understanding that it would not be made public until 1960. The manuscript is now in the British Library.\n\nIn 1913 the unabridged text was read in court. In 1912 Arthur Ransome had published \"Oscar Wilde: a critical study\". Douglas sued Ransome for libel, and the case went to the High Court in April 1913. Ransome's counsel (Campbell) had the unabridged \"De Profundis\" read to the High Court. While the full text \"was so inconsistent as to be quite unreliable as evidence of anything except Wilde's fluctuating state of mind while in prison ... the endless text, read out by Campbell's junior, bored the jury and further irritated the judge. They rebelled, and the reading was broken off; but the unalterable impression that it left in everybody’s mind was that Bosie was, in Labouchere's words, a young scoundrel and that he had ruined his great friend.\" Douglas testified that he had received the letter from Ross, but after reading Ross's cover note threw it in the fire unread. He later said that he had never received the package at all. Observers reported that Douglas could not bear it when he learned that the letter was addressed to him and heard its full contents. Once during the reading he simply disappeared, and was roundly rebuked by the judge. Parts of the text were published subsequently in the London papers. Ross quickly brought out another edition: \"The Suppressed Portion of \"De Profundis\"\", to claim the copyright on Wilde's work. It contained about half of the complete text.\n\nIn 1949, Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland published the full text, but used a faulty typescript bequeathed to him by Ross. Ross's typescripts had contained several hundred errors, including typist's mistakes, his own emendations, and other omissions.\n\nIn 1960, Rupert Hart-Davis examined the manuscript in the library of the British Museum, and produced a new, corrected text from it, which was published in \"The Letters of Oscar Wilde\" in 1962. He wrote that:\n\nThe 1962 Hart-Davis edition is currently still in print in the expanded version of the book titled \"The Complete Letters of Oscar Wilde\", which was published in New York and London in 2000. The British Library (formerly British Museum) published a facsimile of the original manuscript in 2000. The copyright to the text expired in the United Kingdom in 2013; the facsimile has since been in the public domain and is reproduced on the website of the British Library.\n\nIn 2005, Oxford University Press published Volume 2 of \"The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde\". In this volume, entitled \"De Profundis; 'Epistola: In Carcere et Vinculis\"', editor Ian Small tried \"to establish an authoritative (and perhaps definitive) text\" of Wilde's prison letter. The volume also aimed to \"present the complete textual history of one of the most famous love letters ever written\". According to Thefreelibrary.com, Ian Small \"creates an 'eclectic text' based on Vyvyan Holland's 1949 text into which he has collated and interpolated material from the manuscript. There has been some reordering and the omission of 1000 words, here included in square brackets\".\n\nGerman academic Horst Schroeder has, however, compared the previously published typescripts of the \"De Profundis\" text to German-language translations that were published in the first quarter of the 20th century and were prepared by Max Meyerfeld from typescripts he had received from Robert Ross. Based on his findings, Schroeder argues that, due to the large amount of typing errors and unauthorised changes, no previously published typescript of the text (including the 1949 Holland edition) is suitable as a base text and that only the British Museum manuscript (i.e. the 1962 Hart-Davis edition) is \"what really matters.\"\n\nBecause of its posthumous publication in 1962 and the many changes to copyright law since then, the copyright of the full original text of \"De Profundis\" (the 1962 Hart-Davis edition) has had a very different history in different countries. Substantially, the text is in the public domain in the European Union (at the very least in the UK, Ireland, France and Germany), but is in copyright in the United States and Australia.\n\nG. S. Street, who had earlier been an intellectual opponent of the decadents, had two impressions of \"De Profundis\": one, \"that it was poignantly touching, the other it was extraordinarily and profoundly interesting\". Street dismissed contemporary complaints that the letter lacked sincerity, saying this was just a manifestation of those who opposed Wilde's graceful writing style.\n\nMax Beerbohm, an old friend of Wilde's, wrote a signed review, \"A Lord of Language,\" for \"Vanity Fair\". He described the writing in \"De Profundis\" as having achieved the perfect grace of Wilde's earlier work, and said that Wilde had remained a detached artist of words, concluding: \"We see him here as the spectator of his own tragedy. His tragedy was great. It is one of the tragedies that will always live on in romantic history.\"\n\nT. W. H. Crosland, a journalist and friend of Douglas after Wilde's death, negatively reviewed \"De Profundis\" in 1912. He strongly criticised Ross's editing, but claimed the entire document was even more morally bankrupt than the published version: \"A blacker, fiercer, falser, craftier, more grovelling or more abominable piece of writing never fell from a mortal pen\", he wrote.\n\nA version abridged by Merlin Holland was performed by Corin Redgrave in 2000 at the Royal National Theatre in London. It was revived in 2008.\n\nAn abridged version was set for speaking pianist by composer Frederic Rzewski.\n\nExtracts were set to music for chorus and orchestra in 2012 by the British composer Matthew King.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Deportations took place from the late 1920s to the end of World War II.\n\nLutheran Finns had lived in Ingria for over 400 years, since the period of Swedish rule. They had immigrated there from Finland and the Karelian Isthmus and eventually started referring to themselves as Ingrian Finns. In 1919 the population of the Ingrian Finns was 132,000 in Ingria and an additional 10,000 in Petrograd. The Finnish-Soviet peace treaty of 1920 had granted Ingrian Finns a degree of national autonomy. A national district was formed in 1928 and Finnish was used in schools, radio and administration.\n\nSoviet repression of the Ingrian Finns started at the same time as the forced collectivization in the Soviet Union in 1928. Between 1929 and 1931 Soviet authorities deported 18,000 people from areas near the Finnish border, consisting of up to 16% of the total Ingrian Finnic population. All remaining Finns in four border parishes were deported in 1936 and replaced with Russians. In 1937 all Finnish-language schools, publications, broadcasts, and Ingrian Lutheran churches were closed down. During 1937–1938, 4,000 Ingrian Finns were shot and over 10,000 deported to prison camps. By 1939 the Ingrian Finnish population had decreased to about 50,000, which was about 43% of 1928 population figures, and the Ingrian Finn national district was abolished.\n\nFollowing the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the beginning of the Leningrad Blockade, in early 1942 all 20,000 Ingrian Finns remaining in Soviet-controlled territory were deported to Siberia. Most of the Ingrian Finns together with Votes and Izhorians living in German-occupied territory were evacuated to Finland in 1943-1944. After Finland sued for peace, it was forced to return the evacuees. Soviet authorities did not allow the 55,733 people who had been handed over to settle back in Ingria, and instead deported them to central regions of Russia. The main regions of Ingrian Finns forced settlement were the interior areas of Siberia, Central Russia, and Tajikistan.\n\nThe deportations led to the rapid ethnic assimilation of Ingrian Finns. After 1956, return to Ingria was officially allowed but made unfeasible in practice; as a result, many settled in the nearby regions of Estonia and Karelia. In 1989 there were 18,000 Finns in Ingria and Leningrad, and a total of 67,813 in the Soviet Union, with only 34.7 percent declaring Finnish as their main language. Ingrian and other Finns were not differentiated in the official census. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, attempts began to revive Ingrian Finnish cultural life in Ingria, but at the same time, many of them moved to Finland.\n\n\n"}

Persecutions started forty days after the disappearance into occultation of Al-Hakim, who was thought to have been converting people to a Unitarian faith for over twenty years prior. Al-Hakim convinced some heretical followers such as Ad-Darazi of his soteriological divinity and officially declared the Divine call after issuing a decree promoting religious freedom.\n\nThe call summoned people to a true unitarian belief that removed all attributes (wise, just, outside, inside, etc.) from God. It promoted absolute monotheism and the concepts of supporting your fellow man, true speech and pursuit of oneness with God. These concepts superseded all ritual, law and dogma and requirements for pilgrimage, fasting, holy days, prayer, charity, devotion, profession of faith and particular worship of any prophet or person was downplayed. Islamic law was opposed and Druze traditions started during the call continue today, such as meeting for reading, prayer and social gathering on a Thursday instead of a Friday at Khalwats instead of mosques. Such gatherings and traditions were not compulsory and people were encouraged to pursue a state of compliance with the real law of nature governing the universe. Epistle thirteen of the Epistles of Wisdom called it \"A spiritual doctrine without any ritualistic imposition\". The time of the call was seen as a revolution of truth, with missionaries preaching its message all around the Middle East. These messengers were sent out with the Druze epistles and took written vows from believers, whose souls are thought to still exist in the Druze of today. The souls of those who took the vows during the call are believed to be continuously reincarnating in successive generations of Druze until the return of Al-Hakim to proclaim a second Divine call and establish a golden age of justice and peace for all.\n\nIn 1043 Al-Muqtana declared that the sect would no longer accept new pledges, and since that time proselytization has been prohibited awaiting Al-Hakim's return on Judgement day to usher in a new golden age.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "577930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577930", "title": "Dragon dance", "text": "Dragon dance\n\nDragon dance () is a form of traditional dance and performance in Chinese culture. Like the lion dance it is most often seen in festive celebrations. The dance is performed by a team of experienced dancers who manipulate a long flexible figure of a dragon using poles positioned at regular intervals along the length of the dragon. The dance team simulates the imagined movements of this river spirit in a sinuous, undulating manner.\n\nThe dragon dance is often performed during Chinese New Year. Chinese dragons are a symbol of China's culture, and they are believed to bring good luck to people, therefore the longer the dragon in the dance, the more luck it will bring to the community. The dragons are believed to possess qualities that include great power, dignity, fertility, wisdom and auspiciousness. The appearance of a dragon is both fearsome and bold but it has a benevolent disposition, and it was an emblem to represent imperial authority. The movements in a performance traditionally symbolize historical roles of dragons demonstrating power and dignity.\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty, different forms of the dragon dance were described in ancient texts. Rain dance performed at times of drought may involve the use of figures of dragon as Chinese dragon was associated with rain in ancient China, for example the dragon Yinglong was considered a rain deity, and the Shenlong had the power to determine how much wind and rain to bring. According to the Han Dynasty text \"Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals\" by Dong Zhongshu, as part of a ritual to appeal for rain, clay figures of the dragons were made and children or adults may then perform a dance. The number of dragons, their length and colour, as well as the performers may vary according to the time of year. Other dances involving dragons may be found in a popular form of entertainment during the Han Dynasty, the \"baixi\" (百戲) variety shows, where performers called \"mime people\" (象人) dressed up as various creatures such as beasts, fish and dragons. In his \"Lyric Essay on Western Capital\" (西京賦) Zhang Heng recorded various performances such as performers who dressed as a green dragon playing a flute, and a fish-dragon act where fish transformed into a dragon. A version of the fish-dragon dance called \"fish-dragon extending\" (魚龍曼延) was also performed at the Han court to entertain foreign guests – in this dance a mythical beast of Shenli (舍利之獸) transforms into flounder, then to a dragon. These ancient dances however do not resemble modern Dragon Dance in their descriptions, and depictions of dragon dance in Han Dynasty stone relief engravings suggest that the props used may also be cumbersome, unlike modern Dragon Dance where light-weight dragons are manipulated by performers. \nThe dragon acts of the Han Dynasty were also mentioned in the Tang and Song Dynasty. Figures similar to the dragon lantern (龍燈) used during Lantern Festival were described in the Song Dynasty work \"Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital\", where figures of dragon mounted for display were constructed out of grass and cloth and inside which numerous candle lights may be placed. Such dragon lanterns may also be carried and paraded by performers in the street during the Lantern festival at nighttime. A wide variety of dragon dances have developed in various regions in China, for example, the Fenghua Cloth Dragon (奉化布龙) from Zhejiang was made with bamboo frame and covered with cloth, and is said to have been developed in the 1200s. A form of dragon dance from Tongliang County (铜梁龙舞), which originated as snake totem worship, began during the Ming Dynasty and became popular in the Qing Dynasty. In the modern era, the government of People's Republic of China adapted and promoted various traditional folk dances, which contributed to the popularity of the current form of the dragon dance now found widely in China as well as Chinese communities around the world.\n\nAside from the popular form of dragon dance, other regional dragon dances include one from Zhanjiang, Guangdong province whereby the body of the dragon is formed entirely of a human chain of dozens to hundreds of performers, and in Pujiang County, Zhejiang Province, the body of the dragon is formed using wooden stools. The number of different dragon dances has been put at over 700.\n\nThe dragon is a long serpentine body formed of a number of sections on poles, with a dragon head and a tail. The dragon is assembled by joining the series of hoops on each section and attaching the ornamental head and tail pieces at the ends. Traditionally, dragons were constructed of wood, with bamboo hoops on the inside and covered with a rich fabric, however in the modern era lighter materials such as aluminium and plastics have replaced the wood and heavy material.\n\nDragons can range in length from as little as operated by two people for small displays, around for the more acrobatic models, and up to for the larger parade and ceremonial styles. The size and length of a dragon depends on the human power available, financial power, materials, skills and size of the field. A small organization cannot afford to run a very long dragon because it requires considerable human power, great expenses and special skills which are difficult to manage.\nThe normal length and size of the body recommended for the dragon is and is divided into 9 major sections. The distance of each minor (rib-like) section is apart; therefore, the body has 81 rings. Many may also be up to 15 sections long, and some dragons are as long as 46 sections. Occasionally dragon with far more sections may be constructed in Chinese communities around the world to produce longest dragon possible, since part of the myth of the dragon is that the longer the creature, the more luck it will bring. Sun Loong in Bendigo, Australia was, at the time it was made in 1970, the longest dragon in the world measuring approximately and is believed to be the longest regularly used dragon. Much longer dragons have been created for one-off events. The world record for the longest dragon is , set in Hong Kong on 1 October 2012. \n\nHistorically the dragon dance may be performed in a variety of ways with different types and colors of dragon. Green is sometimes selected as a main color of the dragon, which symbolizes a great harvest. Other colors include: yellow symbolizing the solemn empire, golden or silver colors symbolizing prosperity, red color representing excitement while its scales and tail are mostly beautiful silver colors and glittering at all times which provides a feeling of joyous atmosphere. As the Dragon dance is not performed every day, the cloth of the dragon is to be removed and to have a new touch of ultra-paint before the next performance.\n\nThe dragon dance is performed by a skilled team whose job is to bring the motionless body to life. The correct combination and proper timing of the different parts of the dragon are very important to make a successful dance. Any mistakes made by even some of the performers would spoil the whole performance. To be very successful in the dance, the head of the Dragon must be able to coordinate with the body movement to match the timing of the drum. For larger ceremonial and parade style dragons, the head can weigh as much as 12 katis (14.4 kg, almost 32 lb). The dragon tail also has an important role to play as it will have to keep in time with head movements. The fifth section is considered to be the middle portion and the performers must be very alert as the body movements change from time to time. The dragon is often led by a person holding a spherical object representing a pearl.\nThe patterns of the dragon dance are choreographed according to the skills and experiences acquired by the performers. Some of the patterns of the dragon dance are \"Cloud Cave\", \"Whirlpool\", T'ai chi pattern, \"threading the money\", \"looking for pearl\", and \"dragon encircling the pillar\". The movement \"dragon chasing the pearl\" shows that the dragon is continually in the pursuit of wisdom.\n\nThe dragon moves in a wave-like pattern achieved by the co-ordinated swinging of each section in succession. Whilst this swinging constitutes the basic movement of the dragon, executing more complex formations is only limited by a team’s creativity. The patterns and tricks that are performed generally involve running into spiralled formations to make the dragon body turn and twist on itself. This causes performers to jump over or through the dragon’s body sections, adding to the visual display. Other advanced manoeuvres include various corkscrew-like rotating tricks and more acrobatic moves where the performers stand on each other's legs and shoulders to increase the height of the dragon’s movements.\nPerforming in a dragon dance team incorporates several elements and skills; it is something of a cross-over activity, combining the training and mentality of a sports team with the stagecraft and flair of a performing arts troupe. The basic skills are simple to learn, however to become a competent performer takes dedicated training until movements become second nature and complex formations can be achieved – which rely not only on the skill of the individual member, but on concentration by the team as a whole to move in co-operation.\n\nA double dragon dance, rarely seen in Western exhibitions, involves two troupes of dancers intertwining the dragons. Even rarer are dances with the full array of nine dragons, since nine is a \"perfect\" number. Such dances involve large number of participants from various organizations, and are often only possible under the auspices of a regional or national government.\n\nA number of dragon dance competitions have been organized around the world. In competition performances however, there are strict rules governing the specifications of the dragon body and the routine performed, and so dragons made for these events and what are mostly seen in the impressive stage shows are made for speed and agility, to be used by the performing team for maximum trick difficulty. In these dragons, the head is smaller and light enough to be whipped around, and must be a minimum of 3 kg, the body pieces are a light aluminium with cane and the majority of the hoops will be very thin PVC tubing. Performances are typically 8- to 10-minute routines with an accompanying percussion set.\n\nIn more recent times, luminous dragons whereby the dragons are painted with luminous paints that fluoresce under black light are also used in competition.\n\nUnlike the lion dance in many Asian countries where there are numerous native versions of the dance, the dragon dance is found in other countries primarily among overseas Chinese communities. In Japan, the dragon dance (龍踊, \"Ja Odori\" – also referred to as \"Snake Dance\" 蛇踊) is one of the main attractions in the Nagasaki Kunchi festival. The dance was originally performed by Chinese residents who settled in Nagasaki, the only port said to be open for foreign trade in Japan during the Edo period. The dragon dance has also been adapted for other local festivities by the Japanese – a golden dragon dance (金龍の舞, \"Kinryū no Mai\") has been performed at the Sensō-ji in Tokyo since 1958. There is however a form that is unique to Japan – the \"Orochi\" (a great serpent or Japanese dragon) which may be found in a \"kagura\" performance.\n\nIn Vietnam, the dragon dance may be performed during Tết, the Vietnamese New Year.\n\nLawrence Ferlinghetti's poem \"The Great Chinese Dragon\", published in his 1961 anthology \"Starting from San Francisco\" was inspired by the dragon dance.\nGregory Stephenson says the dragon \"... represents 'the force and mystery of life,' the true sight that 'sees the spiritual everywhere translucent in the material world'\".\nEarl Lovelace's novel \"The dragon can't dance\" uses the theme of the Carnival dance to explore social change and history in the West Indies.\n\nArthur Ransome incorporates dragon dances in his children's book \"Missee Lee\", part of the \"Swallows and Amazons\" series, which is set in 1930s China.\n\n\n"}

The \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" contains rules concerning the arbitration and administration of a game, and is intended for use primarily or only by the game's Dungeon Master. The original \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" was published in 1979, and gave Dungeon Masters everything they needed to run a \"D&D\" game campaign.\n\nIt is intended as a companion book to the \"Player's Handbook\", which contains all of the basic rules of gameplay, and the \"Monster Manual\", which is a reference book giving statistics and characteristics to various animals and monsters. The \"Player's Handbook\", \"Dungeon Master's Guide\", and \"Monster Manual\" are collectively referred to as the \"core rules\" of the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game. Both the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Player's Handbook give advice, tips, and suggestions for various styles of play.\n\nWhile all players, including the Dungeon Master, are expected to have at their disposal a copy of the \"Player's Handbook\", only the Dungeon Master is expected to refer to the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" or \"Monster Manual\" during gameplay.\n\nThe original AD&D \"Dungeon Masters Guide\" (sic) was written by Gary Gygax, and published by TSR in 1979 as a 232-page hardcover with a cover by David C. Sutherland III. The 1983 printing featured a new cover by Jeff Easley.\n\nLike other volumes of \"Dungeons & Dragons\" handbooks, the \"Dungeon Masters Guide\" has gone through several versions through the years. The original edition was written by Gary Gygax and edited by Mike Carr, who also wrote the foreword. The original cover art was by David C. Sutherland III, and interior illustrations were provided by Sutherland, D. A. Trampier, Darlene Pekul, Will McLean, David S. LaForce, and Erol Otus.\n\nThe first edition \"Dungeon Masters Guide\" covered all the essential rules for the Dungeon Master: creating and maintaining player characters and managing non-player characters, handling combat, and running adventures and multi-session campaigns. The book also included descriptions of magic items and treasure, random monster encounters, and statistics for the basic monsters and creatures of the game. New magic items were introduced, including the Apparatus of Kwalish.\n\nThe \"Dungeon Masters Guide\" contains scores of tables and charts for figuring damage and resolving encounters in a typical adventure, tables and rules for creating characters, and lists of the various abilities of the different classes of characters.\n\nOne supplement to the \"Guide\" was the \"Dungeon Master's Screen\": two heavy-duty tri-fold boards with the most frequently used tables printed on them for easy reference. The 1979 second edition of the screen describes its purpose as \"useful for shielding maps and other game materials from the players when placed upright, and also provide[s] instant reference to the charts and tables most commonly used during play.\" The \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\" Second Edition screen came packaged with a brief adventure; later editions of that screen, and screens produced for later editions, have instead included character sheets and general reference booklets.\n\nA feature of the first edition \"Dungeon Masters Guide\" was the random dungeon generator. The generator allowed the Dungeon Master, by the rolling of dice, to generate a dungeon adventure \"on the fly\". A dungeon complete with passageways, rooms, treasure, monsters, and other encounters could easily and randomly be constructed as the player progressed. It could be used with several people or a single player. The generator was not included in subsequent editions of the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" but made a re-appearance in the fifth edition \"Dungeon Master's Guide\".\n\nThe original \"Dungeon Masters Guide\" was reviewed by Don Turnbull in issue #16 of the magazine \"White Dwarf\" (December 1979/January 1980). Turnbull commented mostly on the size of the book, \"I would say that only the most severe critic could point at a minor omission, let alone a serious one.\"\n\nThe 1st edition \"Dungeon Masters Guide\" was reproduced as a premium reprint on July 17, 2012.\n\nThe AD&D 2nd Edition \"Dungeon Master Guide\" was released in 1989. This 192-page hardcover book was designed by David \"Zeb\" Cook, with cover art by Jeff Easley. The book featured interior illustrations by Easley, Clyde Caldwell, John and Laura Lakey, David Dorman, Douglas Chaffee, and Jean E. Martin.\n\nThis \"Dungeon Master Guide\" featured revised second edition rules for the Dungeon Master, totally reorganized and streamlined. The book detailed options for character creation, handling alignment, new money and equipment rules, treasure and magical items, encounters, time and movement, and handling non-player characters. The book is indexed, and contains many full-page color illustrations.\n\nThe second edition \"Dungeon Master Guide\" is an ORIGINS and Gamer's Choice award-winner. In his 1991 book \"Heroic Worlds\", Lawrence Schick commented that this book contained \"lots of excellent new advice on how to run \"AD&D\"\". A new version of the \"Dungeon Master Guide\", with new art and layout but the same text, was released in 1995, as part of TSR's 25th anniversary.\n\nThe 2nd edition \"Dungeon Master Guide\" was reproduced as a premium reprint on May 21, 2013.\n\nThe 3rd edition D&D \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" was published in 2000.\n\nMonte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the 3rd edition \"Player's Handbook\", \"Dungeon Master's Guide\", and \"Monster Manual\", and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions. Cook is credited with the book's design. Cover art is by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Lars Grant-West, Scott Fischer, John Foster, Todd Lockwood, David Martin, Arnie Swekel, Kevin Walker, Sam Wood, and Wayne Reynolds.\n\nIn 2003, the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" was revised for the 3.5 edition. David Noonan and Rich Redman are credited for the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" 3.5 revision. Cover art is by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Matt Cavotta, Ed Cox, Lars Grant-West, Scott Fischer, John Foster, Jeremy Jarvis, John and Laura Lakey, Todd Lockwood, David Martin, Raven Mimura, Wayne Reynolds, Scott Roller, Brian Snoddy, Arnie Swekel, and Sam Wood.\n\nWhen asked about the changes from the previous \"Dungeon Master's Guide\", Rich Redman said:\n\nThe D&D \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (v.3.5) was reproduced as a premium reprint on September 18, 2012.\n\nThe 4th edition D&D \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" was released on June 6, 2008, at the same time as its companion volumes. It is a 224-page hardcover written by James Wyatt. The front cover illustration was by Wayne Reynolds and the back cover illustration is by Brian Hagan, with interior illustrations by Rob Alexander, Steve Argyle, Wayne England, Jason Engle, David Griffith, Espen Grundetjern, Brian Hagan, Ralph Horsley, Howard Lyon, Lee Moyer, William O'Connor, Wayne Reynolds, Dan Scott, Ron Spears, Chris Stevens, Anne Stokes, and Eva Widermann. In addition to a comprehensive look at how to DM a 4th Edition campaign or adventure, it contains information on building encounters, aquatic and mounted combat, skill challenges, traps and hazards, rewards, NPC creation, artifacts, monster creation, and template, along with a sample town and short adventure so that DMs can start running their first 4th Edition adventure right away. Although it does contain artifacts, it is the first \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" not to contain standard magic items, which were moved into the \"Player's Handbook\" for 4th Edition. In addition, a \"Dungeon Master's Guide 2\" was released.\n\nAs part of the \"Essentials\" line of products, which were intended as an easy entry point for new players, Wizards of the Coast released a \"Dungeon Master's Kit\" that included a digest-sized book for the Dungeon Master containing much of the same material as the 4th edition \"DMG\" along with a two-part adventure module and a set of cardboard tokens for monsters.\n\nThe 5th edition D&D \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" was released in 2014.\n\nChuck Francisco of mania.com comments: \"Miles of treasure tables escort a wealth of random adventure tables to the ball, where they're resplendent in all of their easy session crafting majesty. The versatility of this tome is nowhere more obvious than amongst the flavor filled side panels, which further detail the lower magical level of the main setting, before explaining all of the variable options a DM has in bringing to life a world of their own.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24689689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24689689", "title": "Eric Doeringer", "text": "Eric Doeringer\n\nEric Doeringer (born July 1, 1974) is an artist currently living and working in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Brown University in 1996 with a B.A. and received an MFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1999. Doeringer is on the faculty at Manhattan's School of Visual Arts.\n\nEric Doeringer's \"Bootlegs\" are small copies of work by eminent contemporary artists including Richard Prince and Lisa Yuskavage. Doeringer reproduces the artworks using \"collage, digital photography, paint and varnish\". Doeringer can make between six and fifteen paintings each day and told \"The New York Times\" in a 2005 interview that his process is \"like an assembly line\". On Saturdays beginning in 2001, he set up a vending table in Chelsea, Manhattan on West 24th Street. Small canvases reproducing contemporary paintings lined the table. Paintings by the original artists (sold within a short walking distance from Doeringer's stand) cost tens of thousands of dollars, while Doeringer's copies sold for less than $100. His total profit in a day of selling paintings has sometimes reached $1500. \"Time Out\" stated that Doeringer is \"famous for bootlegging art on the streets of New York\".\n\nAccording to Doeringer, the majority of the artists he copies do not mind, while others have sent him cease-and-desist letters. Richard Prince was a \"fan\" of his work, while Takashi Murakami put a stop to his copies. Doeringer states that his work is fair use because he \"culled the pictures from the public domain of the Internet\". In 2005, Chelsea art dealer Mike Weiss called the police to remove Doeringer's Bootleg stand from 24th Street. Weiss told \"The New York Times\" that \"he did so for reasons that might be condemned in the art world but that made perfect sense for any businessman like himself who has to pay a huge rent\" and claimed Doeringer was \"an opportunist and that he just wants his 15 minutes\".\n\nIn 2007, Doeringer sold his wares in the Geisai Art Fair in Miami. For the fair, he crafted 42-cent stamps decorated with pictures of celebrities. The stamps, which cost $1, were legally usable as postage and were decorated with photographs of eminent people in the art world. Over his booth, Doeringer placed orange and neon signs that proclaimed \"Best Art Deals in Miami\" and \"Nothing Over $250!\" \"The New York Sun\" deemed his decorations \"a pitch-perfect metamockery of the art fair's commercialism\".\n\nIn 2008, Doeringer began making larger, more faithful recreations of works of Conceptual art by artists like Sol LeWitt, Lawrence Weiner, Edward Ruscha, and On Kawara. \"New York\" magazine called a 2009 exhibition of Doeringer's \"Sol LeWitt Wall Drawings\" \"perfectly executed\" and \"a genuine aesthetic experience, not just a knowing scold.\"\n\nIn 2011, Doeringer exhibited his work at Another Year in L.A.; he titled his exhibition \"Eastern Standard Time\". In one piece, Doeringer copied Charles Ray's 1973 avant-garde photograph panorama \"All My Clothes\". Titled \"All My Clothes (After Charles Ray)\", Doeringer's photographs each contain himself standing in front of a white background attired in various clothes. In an interview with the \"LA Weekly\", he said he adapted Ray's general ideas for the artwork, adding that the key distinction between their works is the \"East Coast-West Coast divide\". Whereas Ray's figure is garbed in a single winter outfit, Doeringer's wears much toastier clothing. Other pieces Doeringer copied and showcased at the Los Angeles exhibition were John Baldessari's \"Throwing Three Balls in the Air to Get a Straight Line\", On Kawara's \"I Went\", Richard Prince's \"Cowboy\" photographs, and several of Edward Ruscha's books.\n\nIn 2012, \"The New York Times\" art critic Ken Johnson reviewed Doeringer's solo exhibition at the Mulherin + Pollard gallery titled \"The Rematerialization of the Art Object\". In the front room, Doeringer displayed \"well-made simulations\" of Damien Hirst's spot paintings and Richard Prince's Marlboro cowboy advertisements. In the back room, Doeringer presented imitations of three artists: Edward Ruscha (counterfeit books), Charles Ray (16 photographs of himself wearing various clothes in imitation of Ray's \"All My Clothes\"), and Andy Warhol (a film mimicking Warhol's \"Empire\" by recording the Empire State Building). Johnson wrote that Doeringer's \"distinction is his focus not on canonical works of Modernism but on famous Conceptualist pieces that are themselves art about art\". In 2013, the \"Toronto Star\"s Murray Whyte reviewed Doeringer's \"Survey\", \"a series of his exacting knock-offs of the late 20th century's greatest art hits\". In addition to containing imitations of works by Damien Hirst, Richard Prince, and Andy Warhol, the exhibition also contained imitations of Sol LeWitt's wall drawings and Lawrence Weiner's spray paintings. Art critic Murray Whyte wrote that Doeringer is \"less heretic than prophet, putting the towering genius of a previous generation to its own test\".\n\nDuring the 2008 Art in Odd Places, Doeringer's project \"Free Books\" involved planting cardboard boxes of free books in four different locations. He removed the final pages of each book to deny the readers from discovering the ending. \"The Daily Telegraph\" speculated about the broader meaning behind his removal of the final pages:\n\nDoeringer later wrote on his website that he appended his name to the \"front of each book, as a type of signature\", and altered the books to make them into \"works of art\". He noted that a reader could become annoyed his alterations instead of realizing their artistic worth.\n\nDoeringer lectures at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. He said in a November 2011 interview with the \"LA Weekly\" that enraged people from the audience have accosted him for creating bootleg copies of artists' works.\n\n"}

Marric, and published between 1955 and 1976. \nPortraying Gideon as a master balancing the management of cases and the workings of law enforcement, it has been considered his \"most famous police procedural series\".\nAfter Creasey's death, the series was continued in five further novels by William Vivian Butler. \n\nAnthony Boucher of the \"New York Times Book Review\" considered the first of the books, \"Gideon's Day\" (1955), to be author's best book. H. R. F. Keating, reviewer for the \"London Times\" picked \"Gideon's Week\" (1956) as one of the \"100 Best Crime and Mystery Books\" (1845-1986). \"Gideon's Fire\" (1962) won the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.\n\nGeorge Gideon (\"G.G.\" or \"Gee-Gee\" to coppers and crooks alike) is powerfully built but has a gentle voice. He has pale-blue eyes. He is famed for his prodigious feats of memory and his ability to handle a bewildering work-load of cases simultaneously. Despite his seniority in rank, Gideon often takes a hands-on approach and on occasions physically engages with criminals. He is respected and liked by his staff - but they know to keep their heads down when his temper is aroused. In the first novel, \"Gideon's Day\" he holds the rank of Detective Superintendent, but in the second \"Gideon's Week\", he has been promoted to Commander, and is the operational head of the Yard's entire CID, a position he holds for the rest of the series. \n\nOne of Creasey's technical advisers for the series was Commander George Hatherill, who had organized the British Army's Special Investigation Branch during World War II, and was the operational head of the Yard's CID from 1954 through 1964 (the same position Gideon held in fiction) during which time he was awarded the OBE. Hatherill is generally believed to have been Creasey's model for Gideon.\n\nThroughout the series, Marric emphasizes the pressure experienced by police families due to the demands of police work, and the impact of distress in the family on the ability to work.\nGideon is married to Kate, and has six surviving children. Their relationship has been strained by the loss of a seventh child while Gideon was on the Flying Squad (prior to the start of the series). In \"Gideon's Day \", the first book in the series, the children are described as Tom (age 26); Prudence (18+), Priscilla (15+), Matthew (14), Penelope (12), and Malcolm (8). The oldest children are self-supporting; the younger ones in school. As the series progresses, the children train for careers, move out, and marry. Family relationships are usually mentioned only briefly, to establish a time frame or as they relate to or affect Gideon's work. \n\nPenny, the Gideon's youngest daughter, is mentioned most frequently, in part because of her on-and-off relationship with an older police officer, Alec Hobbs. In \"Gideon's Wrath\" (1967) Alec Hobbs' first wife Helen dies, around the time that Hobbs becomes Gideon's deputy. In \"Gideon's River\" (1968) Hobbs escorts Penelope to the river gala, accompanying Gideon and Kate. In \"Gideon's Way\", written by William Vivian Butler and published in 1983, Alec and Penny are married and have a son, George.\n\nThe number of children was trimmed in the TV series.\n\nIn \"Gideon's Day\" (1958, directed by John Ford, USA title: \"Gideon Of Scotland Yard\"), Gideon is played by Jack Hawkins. The co-stars were \nAnna Lee (Kate Gideon), \nDianne Foster (Joanna Delafield), \nRonald Howard (Paul Delafield), \nCyril Cusack (Birdy Sparrow), and \nAndrew Ray (PC Simon Farnaby-Green). The film was released by Columbia Pictures and is only loosely based on the book of the same title. Ford treats it as a comedy-melodrama, whereas the book is a more serious and straightforward procedural.\nA 26-part TV series \"Gideon's Way\" (USA title: \"Gideon C.I.D.\") was made in 1964, starring John Gregson, which ran until 1966 in the UK, produced by ITC Entertainment.\n\n\n\"Gideon at Work\" (1957) Three Volumes in one, \"Gideon's Day\", \"Gideon's Week\", \"Gideon's Night\"\n\nThe series was continued after Creasey's death by William Vivian Butler:\n\n\n"}

The book is a revision of the older \"Muyejebo\", made during the reign of King Youngjo (1724–1776).\nIt adds twelve disciplines or \"skills\" of both armed and unarmed fighting by Prince Sado to the original six which were descbribed in the \"Muyejebo\". No copies of the \"Muyesinbo\" have survived, but its contents can easily be determined by tracing back and comparing the \"Muyejebo\" with the later \"Muyedobotongji\".\n\nPrince Sado also originated the term Sib Pal Gi (십팔기, 十八技, “Eighteen [Fighting] Methods” or possibly \"Eighteen [Warrior's] Tools” if using 十八器), shortened from \"Bonjo Muye Sib Pal Ban\" (본조무예십팔반, 本條武藝十八般, \"A Treatise on the 18 Martial Categories of the Yi Dynasty\"). This mirrors the Chinese concept of the \"Eighteen Arms of Wushu\" (十八般兵器) to identify the Korean collection of weapons depicted in the Mu Ye Sin Bo (note that 十八般兵器 is pronounced \"Sip Pal Ban Byeong Gi\" in Korean, 십팔반병기, where the words \"Ban Byeong\" are left out to render Prince Sado's term, and these omitted words roughly translate as \"martial methods\" making them essentially superfluous when taken in context).\n\nThe earlier manual of 1610, \"Muyejebo\" (\"Martial Arts Illustrations\") had as its background the Imjin War (1592–1598), which revealed severe shortcomings in the Korean national army causing King Seonjo (1567–1608) to order reforms based on the successful training model of the Chinese General Qi Jiguang (1527–1587).\n\nDuring the reign of King Yeongjo (1724–1776) the \"Muyejebo\" was revised, and supplemented with 12 additional fighting methods by Prince Sado, published in 1759.\nPrince Sado was the heir-apparent of king Yeongjo, but he suffered from a mental illness which triggered violent outbreaks. After the prince took to randomly killing and raping people in the palace, he was executed by suffocation in 1762, aged 27.\n\nBoth the \"Muyejebo\" and \"Muyesinbo\" formed the basis for the later \"Muyedobotongji\" (\"Comprehensive Illustrated Manual of Martial Arts\") of 1795, which added 4 already depicted disciplines only as executed on horseback (namely: flag spear, twin sabres, moon-knife, and flail) in addition to horsemanship itself as well as a polo-like game, bringing the total number of systems to 24.\n\nThese are the eighteen \"skills\" (技 skill, ability, method) which are classified into three categories (thrust, slice, and strike) and reflect strong influence from Chinese martial arts.\n\nThe first six skills already present in the \"Muyejebo\" can also be found in the \"Muyesinbo\":\nThe remaining twelve skills are original to the \"Muyesinbo\":\n\nThe term \"Sip Pal Gi\" in modern Korean martial arts has come to identify three separate but related activities.\n\nIn modern Korean martial arts, \"Sip Pal Gi\" has come to be used generically, much like \"kung fu\" in the west.\nThere are, however, small groups of practitioners who use the term \"Sip Pal Gi\" historically, for the attempted reconstruction of 18th-century Korean martial arts based on the historical manuals, much in the same way as martial arts reconstruction in the West.\n\n\n"}

State of Georgia, S98A0755, 270 Ga. 327, 510 S.E. 2d 18 (1998) was a decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia. Powell was charged with a complaint in which he had performed non-consensual oral sex upon his wife's 17-year-old niece in his house. The jury acquitted him of the non-consensual portion of the complaint, but convicted him of consensual sodomy.\n\nIn its appeal, the defense argued the statute was unconstitutional; the state argued that a conviction such as this was explicitly upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of \"Bowers v. Hardwick\", 478 U.S. 186 (1986).\n\nIn \"Bowers\", the Attorney General of Georgia had conceded that the sodomy law could not be applied to married heterosexuals, given the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\". Justice John Paul Stevens had observed in his \"Bowers\" dissent that \"Eisenstadt v. Baird\" had extended \"Griswold\" to unmarried heterosexuals, so the sodomy law should not apply to unmarried heterosexuals either.\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court struck down the sodomy statute by a vote of 6-1. The Court found that the individual's right to privacy in the Georgia Constitution are stronger and broader than those in the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment.

{"id": "43022756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43022756", "title": "Progressive conservatism", "text": "Progressive conservatism\n\nProgressive conservatism is a political ideology which attempts to combine conservative and progressive policies. The initial origins of progressivism come from Western Europe during the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment when it was believed that social reform and progression in areas such as science, economics, education, technology and medicine were necessary to improve human living conditions. However, during the 19th century British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli advocated an alternative form of progressive politics known as progressive conservatism under his one-nation conservative government.\n\nWitnessing the negative impacts current working conditions had on people during the time, mainly brought about by the Industrial Revolution, Disraeli started to believe that changes to society were not only necessary but needed to improve human and environmental conditions. However, this progression needed to be done through conservative thinking and policies, namely that the government can do good and should get involved, but only when it is necessary and within its own means, being a limited but obligatory government. The idea advocates that a social safety net is required, but only in a minimal form. Christian democracy and Catholic social teaching promotes some form of progressive conservatism, derived from the text of \"Rerum novarum\". Progressive conservatives also believe instant change is not always the best and can sometimes be damaging to society, therefore cautious change is necessary which fits in with the nations social and political traditions.\n\nIn Britain, one-nation conservatives such as David Cameron who launched the Progressive Conservatism Project in 2009 and Theresa May have described themselves as progressive conservatives. Other European leaders such as Angela Merkel have been aligning themselves with centre-progressive politics with a conservative stance.\n\n"}
{"id": "158226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158226", "title": "Reactionary", "text": "Reactionary\n\nIn political science, a reactionary is a person who holds political views that favor a return to the \"status quo ante\", the previous political state of society, which he or she believes possessed characteristics (discipline, respect for authority, etc.) that are negatively absent from the contemporary \"status quo\" of a society. As an adjective, the word \"reactionary\" describes points of view and policies meant to restore the \"status quo ante\".\n\nPolitical reactionaries are predominantly found on the right-wing of a political spectrum, though left-wing reactionaries exist as well. Reactionary ideologies can also be radical, in the sense of political extremism, in service to re-establishing the \"status quo ante\". In political discourse, being a reactionary is generally regarded as negative; the descriptor \"political reactionary\" has been adopted by the likes of the Austrian monarchist Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, the Scottish journalist Gerald Warner of Craigenmaddie, the Colombian political theologian Nicolás Gómez Dávila, and the American historian John Lukacs.\n\nThe French Revolution gave the English language three politically descriptive words denoting anti-progressive politics: \"reactionary\", \"conservative\" and \"right\". \"Reactionary\" derives from the French word \"réactionnaire\" (a late 18th century coinage based on the word \"réaction\", \"reaction\") and \"conservative\" from \"conservateur\", identifying monarchist parliamentarians opposed to the revolution. In this French usage, reactionary denotes \"a movement towards the reversal of an existing tendency or state\" and a \"return to a previous condition of affairs\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" cites the first English language usage in 1799 in a translation of Lazare Carnot's letter on the Coup of 18 Fructidor.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, conservative forces (especially within the Roman Catholic Church) organized opposition to the progressive sociopolitical and economic changes brought by the revolution; and they fought to restore the temporal authority of the Church and Crown. In 19th century European politics, the reactionary class included the Roman Catholic Church's hierarchy—the clergy, the aristocracy, royal families and royalists—believing that national government is the sole domain of the Church and the state. In France, supporters of traditional rule by direct heirs of the House of Bourbon dynasty were labelled the legitimist reaction. In the Third Republic, the monarchists were the reactionary faction, later renamed conservative. These forces also saw \"reaction\" as a legitimate response to the often rash \"action\" of the French Revolution, hence there is nothing inherently derogatory in the term reactionary and it is sometimes also used to describe the principle of waiting for an opponent's action to take part in a general reaction. In Protestant Christian societies, reactionary has described those supporting tradition against modernity.\n\nIn the 19th century, reactionary denoted people who idealized feudalism and the pre-modern era—before the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution—when economies were mostly agrarian, a landed aristocracy dominated society, a hereditary king ruled and the Roman Catholic Church was society's moral centre. Those labelled as \"reactionary\" favoured the aristocracy instead of the middle class and the working class. Reactionaries opposed democracy and parliamentarism.\n\nThe Thermidorian Reaction was a movement within the revolution against perceived excesses of the Jacobins. On 27 July 1794 (9 Thermidor year II in the French Republican Calendar), Maximilien Robespierre's Reign of Terror was brought to an end. The overthrow of Robespierre signalled the reassertion of the French National Convention over the Committee of Public Safety. The Jacobins were suppressed, the prisons were emptied and the Committee was shorn of its powers. After the execution of some 104 Robespierre supporters, the Thermidorian Reaction stopped the use of the guillotine against alleged counterrevolutionaries, set a middle course between the monarchists and the radicals and ushered in a time of relative exuberance and its accompanying corruption.\n\nWith the Congress of Vienna, inspired by Tsar Alexander I of Russia, the monarchs of Russia, Prussia and Austria formed the Holy Alliance, a form of collective security against revolution and Bonapartism. This instance of reaction was surpassed by a movement that developed in France when, after the second fall of Napoleon, the Bourbon Restoration or reinstatement of the Bourbon dynasty, ensued. This time it was to be a constitutional monarchy, with an elected lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies. The Franchise was restricted to men over the age of forty, which indicated that for the first fifteen years of their lives they had lived under the \"ancien régime\". Nevertheless, King Louis XVIII was worried that he would still suffer an intractable parliament. He was delighted with the ultra-royalists, or Ultras, whom the election returned, declaring that he had found a \"chambre introuvable\", literally, an \"unfindable house\".\n\nIt was the Declaration of Saint-Ouen that prepared the way for the Restoration. Before the French Revolution, which radically and bloodily overthrew most aspects of French society's organisation, the only way constitutional change could be instituted was by extracting it from old legal documents that could be interpreted as agreeing with the proposal. Everything new had to be expressed as a righteous revival of something old that had lapsed and had been forgotten. This was also the means used for diminished aristocrats to get themselves a bigger piece of the pie. In the 18th century, those gentry whose fortunes and prestige had diminished to the level of peasants would search diligently for every ancient feudal statute that might give them something. The \"ban,\" for example, meant that all peasants had to grind their grain in their lord's mill. Therefore, these gentry came to the French States-General of 1789 fully prepared to press for the expansion of such practices in all provinces, to the legal limit. They were horrified when, for example, the French Revolution permitted common citizens to go hunting, one of the few perquisites that they had always enjoyed everywhere.\n\nThus with the restoration of the Bourbons, the \"Chambre Introuvable\" set about reverting every law to return society not merely to the \"ancien régime\" with its absolute monarchy, but to even earlier conditions when the aristocracy really was a socially powerful class. It is this which clearly distinguishes a \"reactionary\" from a \"conservative.\" The conservative would have accepted many improvements brought about by the revolution, and simply refused a program of wholesale \"reversion\". Use of the word \"reactionary\" in later days as a political slur is thus often rhetorical, since there is nothing directly comparable with the \"Chambre Introuvable\" in the history of other countries.\n\nIn the revolution's aftermath, France was continually wracked with the quarrels between the right-wing legitimists and left-wing revolutionaries. Herein arose the clerical philosophers—Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Bonald, François-René de Chateaubriand—whose answer was restoring the House of Bourbon and reinstalling the Roman Catholic Church as the established church. Since then, France's political spectrum has featured similar divisions. (see \"Action Française\"). The ideas of the clerical philosophers were buttressed by the teachings of the 19th century popes.\n\nDuring the period of 1815-1848, Prince Metternich, the foreign minister of the Austrian Empire, stepped in to organise containment of revolutionary forces through international alliances meant to prevent the spread of revolutionary fervour. At the Congress of Vienna, he was very influential in establishing the new order, the Concert of Europe, after the defeat of Napoleon.\n\nAfter the Congress, Prince Metternich worked hard bolstering and stabilising the conservative regime of the Restoration period. He worked furiously to prevent Russia's Tsar Alexander I (who aided the liberal forces in Germany, Italy and France) from gaining influence in Europe. The Church was his principal ally, promoting it as a conservative principle of order while opposing nationalist and liberal tendencies within the Church. His basic philosophy was based on Edmund Burke, who championed the need for old roots and an orderly development of society. He opposed democratic and parliamentary institutions but favoured modernising existing structures by gradual reform. Despite Metternich's efforts a series of revolutions rocked Europe in 1848.\n\nIn the 20th century, proponents of socialism and communism used the term \"reactionary\" polemically to label their enemies, such as the White Armies, who fought in the Russian Civil War against the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution. In Marxist terminology, \"reactionary\" is a pejorative adjective denoting people whose ideas might appear to be socialist, but, in their opinion, contain elements of feudalism, capitalism, nationalism, fascism or other characteristics of the ruling class, including usage between conflicting factions of Marxist movements. Non-socialists did also use the label \"reactionary\", with British diplomat Sir John Jordan nicknaming the Chinese Royalist Party the \"reactionary party\" for supporting the Qing dynasty and opposing republicanism during the Xinhai Revolution in 1912.\n\n\"Reactionary\" is also used to denote supporters of authoritarian anti-communist régimes such as Vichy France, Spain under Franco, and Portugal under Salazar. One example of this took place after Boris Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. On 26 October 1958, the day following the Nobel Committee's announcement, Moscow's \"Literary Gazette\" ran a polemical article by David Zaslavski entitled, \"Reactionary Propaganda Uproar over a Literary Weed\".\n\nReactionary feelings were often coupled with a hostility to modern, industrial means of production and a nostalgia for a more rural society. The Vichy regime in France, Franco's regime, the Salazar regime in Portugal and Maurras's \"Action Française\" political movements are examples of such traditional reactionary feelings, in favour of authoritarian regimes with strong unelected leaders and with Catholicism as a state religion. The motto of Vichy France was \"travail, famille, patrie\"(\"work, family, homeland\"), and its leader, Marshal Philippe Pétain, declared that \"la terre, elle ne ment pas\" (\"the earth, it does not lie\") in an indication of his belief that the truest life is rural and agrarian.\n\nThe Italian Fascists showed a desire to bring about a new social order based on the ancient feudal principle of delegation (though without serfdom) in their enthusiasm for the corporate state. Benito Mussolini said that \"fascism is reaction\" and that \"fascism, which did not fear to call itself reactionary... has not today any impediment against declaring itself illiberal and anti-liberal.\"\n\nHowever, Gentile and Mussolini also attacked certain reactionary policies, particularly monarchism and—more veiled—some aspects of Italian conservative Catholicism. They wrote, \"History doesn't travel backwards. The fascist doctrine has not taken De Maistre as its prophet. Monarchical absolutism is of the past, and so is ecclesiolatry.\" They further elaborated in the political doctrine that fascism \"is not reactionary [in the old way] but revolutionary.\" Conversely, they also explained that fascism was of the right, not of the left. Fascism was certainly not simply a return to tradition: it carried the centralised state beyond even what had been seen in absolute monarchies. Fascist one-party states were as centralised as most communist states, and fascism's intense nationalism was not found in the period prior to the French Revolution.\n\nThe German Nazis did not consider themselves reactionary, and considered the forces of reaction (Prussian monarchists, nobility, Roman Catholic) among their enemies right next to their Red Front enemies in the Nazi Party march \"Die Fahne hoch\". The fact that the Nazis called their 1933 rise to power the \"National Revolution\", shows that they supported some form of revolution. Nevertheless, they idealised tradition, folklore, classical thought, leadership (as exemplified by Frederick the Great), rejected the liberalism of the Weimar Republic, and called the German state the Third Reich (which traces back to the medieval First Reich and the pre-Weimar Second Reich). (See also Reactionary modernism.)\n\nClericalist movements, sometimes labelled as clerical fascist by their critics, can be considered reactionaries in terms of the 19th century, since they share some elements of fascism, while at the same time promote a return to the pre-revolutionary model of social relations, with a strong role for the Church. Their utmost philosopher was Nicolás Gómez Dávila.\n\nPolitical scientist Corey Robin argues that modern American conservatism\nis fundamentally reactionary in his book \"The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Sarah Palin\".\n\n\"Neoreactionary\" is a term applied to, and sometimes a self-description of, an informal group of online political theorists who have been active since the 2000s. The phrase \"neo-reactionary\" was coined by \"Mencius Moldbug\" (the pseudonym of Curtis Yarvin, a computer programmer) in 2008. Arnold Kling used it in 2010 to describe \"Moldbug\" and the subculture quickly adopted it. Proponents of the \"Neo-Reactionary\" movement (also called the \"Dark Enlightenment\" movement) include philosopher Nick Land, among others. The movement's objectives included opposition to any form of egalitarianism as well as \"a return to traditional gender roles, monarchism, and typically a more libertarian-oriented economic system\".\n\n\n"}

The players pretend to be (and transform) into players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Wayne Rooney, Zlatan Ibrahimović, David Luiz, Andrea Pirlo, Thibaut Courtois, Gonzalo Higuaín, Eden Hazard, Gerard Piqué, Andrés Iniesta, Mario Götze, Thiago Silva and Tim Howard. The ad features cameos by Irina Shayk, Kobe Bryant, Jon Jones, Anderson Silva and the Incredible Hulk. As the match nears the end with a 2–2 tie and a \"next goal wins\" scenario, a young boy takes the ball off Ronaldo, and with immense pressure upon him from people across the globe watching the match, scores the penalty and wins the game for his team.\n\nAn animated feature created in collaboration with Passion Pictures, the ad shows the scientist, promoter of \"Perfect Inc.\", giving a presentation on how football players are reckless in their game play and \"take too many risks\". He unveils clones, which are programmed for perfect, no-risk-taken football and focus on efficiency, accuracy and risk mitigation by guaranteed results. The world of football (and sports) suffers from these clones, as they defeat the real players, put them out of business, and drive sports to near-extinction.\n\nRetired Brazilian football legend Ronaldo, who is saddened by this state of football, watches a young boy practising football tricks all alone and an interview of the scientist, in which he says \"Before Perfect Inc. football was a wild and unpredictable affair. I've changed that\" which fires him up and embarks on a mission to save football. He rescues the now-forgotten players: Zlatan Ibrahimović, trying to sell copies of his autobiography \"I Am Zlatan Ibrahimović\"; Cristiano Ronaldo, who now works as a mannequin in \"Sport-U-Gal\" sports equipment store; Andrés Iniesta, now a farmer; Neymar and David Luiz, barbers at a beauty salon, trimming the hair of their clones; and Wayne Rooney, a fisherman. Their spirits are raised by Ronaldo, who motivates them by showing them glimpses of their former glory and the death football is facing. There, Neymar takes a selfie on a statue. Rooney questions, \"We all want to destroy the clones, but they all are unbeatable!\" Ronaldo replies: \"Nobody thinks that they can be beatable, but you can do it!\" The players challenge the clones to a football match; the team with the first goal wins, and the losers quit football for eternity.\n\nThe Players outsmart the clones with their skills despite the Scientist activating a fail-safe which introduces more clones to the field; the match ends with Cristiano Ronaldo effortlessly scoring a goal. As the players celebrate and the Scientist sulks, the entire world cheers and human players start returning to sports. A jubilant Ronaldo looks at the players celebrating, and exclaims, \"Clone that!\"\n\nOn 9 March 2014, Nike organized a question-and-answer session on Twitter with then-Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimović; Twitter users asked questions to Ibrahimović by tweeting with the hashtag #DareToZlatan.\n"}
{"id": "5632611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5632611", "title": "Rose Center for Earth and Space", "text": "Rose Center for Earth and Space\n\nThe Rose Center for Earth and Space is a part of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The Center's complete name is The Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space. The main entrance is located on the northern side of the museum on 81st Street near Central Park West in Manhattan's Upper West Side. Completed in 2000, it includes the new Hayden Planetarium, the original of which was opened in 1935 and closed in 1997. Neil deGrasse Tyson is its first and, , only director.\n\nThe center is an extensive reworking of the former Hayden Planetarium, whose first projector, dedicated in 1935, had 2 successors previous to the current one.\n\nThe original Hayden Planetarium was founded in 1933 with a donation by philanthropist Charles Hayden. In 1935, the Hayden Planetarium, designed by architects Trowbridge & Livingston, opened, after its construction was funded by a $650,000 loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and a $150,000 donation from banker Charles Hayden of Hayden, Stone & Co. Its mission was to give the public \"a more lively and sincere appreciation of the magnitude of the universe... and for the wonderful things which are daily occurring in the universe.\" Joseph M. Chamberlain, hired as an assistant curator in 1952, became Chairman of the Planetarium in 1956. In 1960, a Zeiss Mark IV projector was installed, followed by a Zeiss Mark VI projector and new seats in 1993.\n\nIn January 1997, the original Hayden Planetarium was closed and demolished. In August 1999, a new, customized Zeiss Mark IX projector was installed, accompanied by a digital dome projection system that provides a 3-D visualization of the universe based on images generated in real time by a Silicon Graphics supercomputer.\n\nOn February 19, 2000, the $210 million Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space, containing the new Hayden Planetarium, opened to the public. The Rose Center is named after two members of the Rose family, and was designed by James Polshek and Todd H. Schliemann of Polshek Partnership Architects with the exhibition design by Ralph Appelbaum Associates. Tom Hanks provided the voice-over for the first planetarium show during the opening of the new Rose Center for Earth & Space in the Hayden Planetarium in 2000. Since then such celebrities as Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Redford, Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson and Maya Angelou have been featured.\n\nDesigned by Polshek and Todd Schliemann, the building consists of a six-story high glass cube enclosing the illuminated Hayden Sphere, which appears to float, although it is actually supported by truss work. Polshek has referred to this work as a \"cosmic cathedral\".\n\nThe Rose Center and its adjacent plaza are both located on the north face of the Museum; the Center encloses of research, education, and exhibition spaces, in addition to the Hayden Planetarium. Also located in the facility is the Department of Astrophysics, the newest academic research department in the Museum. Furthermore, Polshek designed the Weston Pavilion, a high transparent structure of \"water white\" glass along the Museum's west facade. This structure, a small companion piece to the Rose Center, offers a new entry way to the Museum, as well as opening further exhibition space for astronomically-related objects. The planetarium's original magazine, \"The Sky\", merged with another journal, \"The Telescope\", to become the leading astronomy magazine \"Sky & Telescope\".\n\nThe exhibits highlight human connection to the cosmos along with the scale and properties of the observable universe itself. When the new Rose Center opened with a model of only eight planets, excluding Pluto, which had been thought of as the ninth planet, it resulted in a headline-making controversy.\n\nThe Hayden Planetarium (often called \"The Hayden Sphere\" or \"The Great Sphere\") has, since 2000, been one of the two main attractions within the Rose Center. It was established by the State of New York in 1933, some of the funding coming from philanthropist Charles Hayden. The top half of the Hayden Sphere houses the Star Theater, which uses high-resolution fulldome video to project “space shows” based on scientific visualization of current astrophysical data, in addition to a customized Zeiss Star Projector system replicating an accurate night sky as seen from Earth. The Star Theater is one of the world's pre-eminent planetariums, which incorporates high-resolution full-dome video to create \"space shows\", based in scientific visualization of current astrophysical data. \n\nThe Big Bang Theater, which occupies the bottom half of the Hayden Sphere, depicts the birth of the universe in a four-minute program. Utilizing a screen that measures in diameter over an bowl, a four-minute program depicts the birth of the universe, with narration by Liam Neeson. The Big Bang Theater serves as an introduction to the Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway, a spiral which wraps around the sphere, connecting the second and first floors of the Rose Center. The cosmic pathway provides a timeline of the universe's history from the Big Bang to the present day. The Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway is one of the most popular exhibits in the Rose Center, which opened February 19, 2000.\n\nThe Hayden Planetarium offers a number of courses and public presentations including the Frontiers of Astrophysics and Distinguished Authors lecture series.\n\nAs visitors leave the Planetarium theater, they exit to the Size Scales of the Universe exhibit which shows the vast array of sizes in the universe; the walkway itself is a timeline of the Universe from the Big Bang to the present. This exhibit leads to the Big Bang Theater and exits to the Heilbrun Cosmic Pathway, an interactive exhibit designed by the AMNH Exhibitions Lab at the Rose Center, which shows the history of the universe. From the bottom of the Cosmic Pathway, visitors can stop by the Hall of Planet Earth to explore geology, weather, plate tectonics, and more, or go down to the Hall of the Universe to explore the realms of planets, stars, galaxies and more. The ramp illustrates 13 billion years of cosmic history at a rate of about 36,111,111 years per foot (about 1,184,748 years per centimeter); a typical adult walking step length of approximately covers about 84 million years.\n\nAlong the pathway are thirteen markers denoting the passage of each billion years. At eight landings, panels show visitors the relative size of the universe at that point in time, along with major developmental stages of the universe including the first generation of stars, globular clusters, quasars, elliptical galaxies, galactic bulges, radio galaxies, the Milky Way Galaxy, galactic disks, and later generations of stars. At each of the landings, computer interactives provide overviews of the entire pathway, and more in-depth information, as well as connections to exhibit topics in the Hall of the Universe.\n\nWalking down the pathway, visitors also pass by a photographic record of cosmic history. Astronomical images appear at that time of the universe corresponding to that place on the pathway. The light from these objects has taken billions of years to reach the earth, and visitors see them not as they are now, but as they were when their light began its journey toward Earth. Among these are some of the most distant celestial objects known to scientists, along with their cosmic \"red shift\", the measurement that indicates what epoch of the expanding universe is being shown. Panels along the beginning of the Pathway are intentionally left blank in order allow space to document future discoveries of new \"record holders\" that are even more distant than the ones currently known.\n\nArtifacts along the Heilbrunn Cosmic Pathway include presolar grains, a meteorite that dates from the birth of our solar system, a sample from the oldest rock formation on Earth, a stromatolite as an example of multicellular life formation, a trilobite, the first animal with eyes; and the fossilized serrated tooth of a giant carnivorous dinosaur. The Cosmic Pathway concludes with the Age of Dinosaurs, which became extinct 66 million years ago, less than from the end of the Pathway. The duration of recorded human history is portrayed, by contrast, as comparable to the thickness of a human hair.\n\nThe Ross Terrace adjacent to the Rose Center for Earth and Space, and built over the new parking garage on 81st Street. This rooftop plaza is designed to be a stage set that celebrates both astronomy and Earth’s natural history, as well as an outdoor gathering place for museum visitors. Renowned garden designer Kathryn Gustafson formed the concept for the Terrace after seeing an illustration of shadows cast by a lunar eclipse. A terrace covering was designed by Charles Morris Anderson as a Landscape Architect, and his design was awarded the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) Design award in 2003.\n\n, five shows have premiered in the theater. The first show, \"Passport to the Universe\", opened with the new theater and features the voice of Tom Hanks as a guide along a voyage from Earth to the edge of the observable universe. \"The Search for Life: Are We Alone?\" debuted in 2002, with narration by Harrison Ford describing the possibilities of extraterrestrial life. Opened in 2006 and narrated by Robert Redford, \"Cosmic Collisions\" examines the role that impacts have played in shaping the universe—including visualizations of Earth's magnetosphere, the formation of the Moon, and the meteorite impact that contributed to the end of the age of dinosaurs. \"Journey to the Stars\", narrated by Whoopi Goldberg, premiered on, July 4, 2009, featuring extraordinary images from telescopes on the ground and in space and stunning, never-before-seen visualizations of physics-based simulations. \"Dark Universe\", narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson, premiered on November 2, 2013.\n\nOther exhibits can be found outside the sphere. The Gottesman Hall of the Planet Earth has displays that illustrate the Earth's geological history and weather patterns. The Cullman Hall of the Universe focuses on topics ranging from planets to stars, life on other worlds to current cosmology. The Scales of the Universe exhibit makes comparisons between the size of the Hayden Sphere and other objects in the universe presented at appropriate relative scale. There is also a photographic exhibit about the Apollo moon landings. The photographs are throughout the first floor level of the Rose Center.\n\n\n\nRose Center exhibitions\n\n\nHayden Planetarium\n\n"}

{"id": "1104478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1104478", "title": "Square foot gardening", "text": "Square foot gardening\n\nSquare Foot Gardening is the practice of dividing the growing area into small square sections (typically 12\" on a side, hence the name). The aim is to assist the planning and creating of a small but intensively planted vegetable garden. It results in a simple and orderly gardening system, from which it draws much of its appeal. Mel Bartholomew coined the term \"square foot gardening\" in his 1981 book of the same name.\n\nThe phrase \"square foot gardening\" was popularized by Mel Bartholomew in a 1981 Rodale Press book and subsequent PBS television series. Bartholomew a retired engineer, devised a raised 4’x4’square bed(s)with a grid. Each of these 4’ by 4’ square beds were then divided into sixteen one foot squares (the grid). Each square is planted with a different crop species based on a formulation of either one, four, nine or sixteen plants per square depending on its overall size. Once a “square foot” is harvested, a different crop can be planted for a continual harvest. \nTo encourage a variety of different crops in succession, and discourage pests, each square would be used for a different kind of plant (crop rotation) within the growing season. The number of plants per square would depend on an individual plant's size. For example, a single tomato plant takes a full square, as might herbs such as oregano, basil or mint, while lettuce plants would be planted four per square, and up to sixteen per square of plants such as radish or carrots. Tall plants are trellised on the north side of the bed to avoid shading smaller plants and prevent sprawling on the ground.\n\nOne advantage of densely planted crops is that they can form a living mulch, and also prevent weeds from establishing or even germinating. Also, natural insect repellent methods such as companion planting (eg planting marigolds or other naturally pest-repelling plants) become more efficient in a close space, which may reduce the need to use pesticides. The large variety of crops in a small space also prevents plant diseases from spreading easily\n\nSince the beds are typically small, making covers or cages to protect plants from pests, cold, or sun is more practical than with larger gardens. To extend the growing season of a square foot garden, a cold/hot frame may be built around the SFG, and by facing the cold/hot frame south, the SFG captures more light and heat during the colder months of spring and winter.\n\nIn 2006, Bartholemew updated the concept with the book \"All New Square Foot Gardening\", which advocates using “Mel’s Mix” created by Bartholomew. After much experimentation, Bartholomew concluded that his formulation of 1/3 peat moss or coconut coir, 1/3 vermiculite and 1/3 blended compost yielded superior results in only a 6” depth. The benefits of the mix included keeping soil friable, virtually weed free with all the necessary nutrients. This mix eliminated the need for artificial fertilizer as compost is added each time you re-plant a square which provides enough nutrients naturally.\n\n\n"}

Tillet was a leading box office draw in the early 1940s and was twice contracted to act as World Heavyweight Champion by the American Wrestling Association run by Paul Bowser in Boston.\n\nTillet was born in 1903 in the Ural Mountains in Russia to French parents. His mother was a teacher and his father was a railroad engineer. Tillet's father died when he was young. As a child he had a completely normal appearance and Tillet was nicknamed \"The Angel\" due to his angelic face. In 1917, Tillet and his mother left Russia due to the Revolution and moved to France, where they settled in Reims. When Tillet was 20, he noticed swelling in his feet, hands, and head, and after visiting a doctor was diagnosed with acromegaly—a condition usually caused by a benign tumor on the pituitary gland, resulting in bone overgrowth and thickening.\n\nHe had wanted to become a lawyer, but his acromegaly prevented him from doing so. Tillet served in the French Navy for five years as an engineer.\n\nIn February 1937, Tillet met Karl Pojello (Lithuanian Karolis Požėla) in Singapore. Pojello was a professional wrestler, and convinced Tillet to enter the business. Tillet and Pojello moved to Paris for training, and Tillet wrestled for two years in France and England until World War II forced them to leave for the United States in 1939.\n\nIn Boston, Massachusetts, in 1940, promoter Paul Bowser pushed Tillet, who was wrestling as The French Angel, as a main eventer, and he became a large draw in the area. As a result of his popularity, Tillet was booked as unstoppable, scripted to win for a span of 19 consecutive months. Tillet acted as the AWA World Heavyweight Champion from May 1940 until May 1942. In early 1942, he also worked as the Montreal-based world heavyweight champion. He re-appeared with the Boston-based title for a short time in 1944.\n\nAs a result of his success, several Angel imitators emerged, including Paul Olaffsen (Swedish Angel), who also had acromegaly; Tony Angelo (Russian Angel), Tor Johnson (Super Swedish Angel), Jack Rush (Canadian Angel), Wladislaw Tulin (Polish Angel), Stan Pinto (Czech Angel), Clive Welsh (Irish Angel), Jack Falk (Golden Angel), Gil Guerrero (Black Angel), and Jean Noble (Lady Angel). Tillet competed against Tor Johnson, who was billed as The Swedish Angel on those occasions.\n\nBy 1945, Tillet's health began to fail and he was no longer advertised as unstoppable. In his final wrestling match, in Singapore on February 14, 1953, working The National Wrestling Alliance Mid South Area then known as Tri-State and owned by Leroy McGuirk he agreed to lose to Bert Assirati.\n\nIn 1950, Chicago sculptor Louis Linck befriended Tillet and made a series of plaster busts commemorating him for his wrestling career. One of the busts is in Chicago’s International Museum of Surgical Science.\n\nTillet died on September 4, 1954, in Chicago, from cardiovascular disease. Tillet is buried at Lithuanian National Cemetery in Justice, Illinois, Cook County, south of Chicago.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35495222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35495222", "title": "Travancore State Manual", "text": "Travancore State Manual\n\nTravancore State Manual was a publication of the erstwhile Travancore kingdom, written and published under the statutory command of the king of Travancore. Travancore kingdom was located at the southernmost tip of the South Asian Subcontinent (currently consisting of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh), on its western side. \n\"Travancore State Manual\" was written by V. Nagam Aiya, who was then working as the Dewan Peishcar in Travancore government service. \n\nThe section on the Fauna of Travancore was contributed by Harold S. Ferguson Esq. F. L. N., F. Z. S), who Nagam Aiya describes in the following words: \"a subject upon which he is an authority having spent nearly the whole of his life in the country, first as a Planter for several years on the Travancore Hills, then as the Guardian of the Princes, then as Commandant of one of the battalions in the Travancore army (Nayar Brigade), and lastly as the Director of the Government Museum and the Public Gardens at Trivandrum.\"\n\nV Nagam Aiya mentions that he was commanded by His Highness, the Maharajah of Travancore to write the \"Travancore State Manual\" with the simple instruction that it should follow the model of the district manuals of the Madras Presidency, which was under English rule. However, he also mentions that the idea had been ‘broached’ to him by Dewan T. Rama Row, C.I.E., some fourteen years earlier. At that time, Nagam Aiya had been working as the Dewan Peishcar and District Magistrate of Quilon. Even though, the Dewan did obtain the Maharajah sanction for the project, the Dewan himself retired within a few months, and the matter was dropped. \n\nHowever, the matter was revived by Dewan Mr. K. Krishnaswamy Row, C.I.E., in 1901. Nagam Aiya did a lot of pioneering and original research and work to obtain a lot of information for the preparation of this book. What came out was a book of ‘encyclopaedic nature spread over a space of more than 1820 pages of letter-press’. \n\nIt might be correct to think that Nagam Aiya did have this project in his mind, and he must have collected or at least noted down a lot of information much before he started on this work. He started his work on this project as a full-time officer from December 1904. \n\nThe \"Travancore State Manual\" is a huge book not only on the antiquity of Travancore, but also of various other features of the place. It is not a just a book on the history of the place. A detailed study and examination of the physical features, geology, Climate, Rainfall, Meteorology, Flora, Fauna, and Archaeology of the place is also there. \n\nDetailed writings are there on the geographical location, boundaries, shape and area of the landscape, mountains, plateaus, mountain passes, rivers, canal and backwaters, coastline, ports, shipping facilities, economic geology of the place, climate, rainfall, meteorology, trees, and medicinal plants, flowering and ornamental plants, birds and animals etc., archaeology, architecture, sculpture, coins, inscriptions, forts and military works, ‘Archaeology’, ‘Fauna’, census and population, language, economic condition and various other things are dealt with, in a manner that should astound.\nThere are a number of photographs. Apart from that, there are many pictures of the stone inscriptions collected from various parts of the kingdom. \nThe latter part of the book deals in detail on the history of the localities that were later to be joined together to form Travancore kingdom. The delineation of history starts from the Parasurama legend. This legend is also mentioned in great detail. Then it slowly moves to the times of the Perumals. \n\nMentions about the Malabar and Travancore coasts in the ancient maritime trade records are seen sourced out. \n\nThen the history part deals with the ancient kings. There is a mention of a Kurava King, who seems to have been assassinated in a premeditated conspiracy. \n\nThere is either detailed mention or detailed write-up on such items as early missionaries, neighbouring kingdoms, accounts of Travellers, Portuguese in Malabar and Travancore, Ettuvittial Pillamaar, Marthanda Varma, Zamorin, small kings and kingdoms north of Travancore, small-time rulers of Malabar, the attacks and occupation attempts by Sultan Tipu etc. \n\nVelu Thampi Dalawa’s rebellion is dealt with in details. Even though there is sympathy for the person, in a profound analysis, Nagam Aiya does not find his cause correct or praiseworthy. The proclamation made by Velu Thampi from Kundara is quoted in an elaborate manner. However, a full reading of the same would not find it to be in sync with modern Indian aspirations. \n\nQUOTE: Velu Tampi was a daring and clever though unscrupulous man. Rebellion was his forte. END of QUOTE. \n\nQUOTE: His favourite modes of punishment were: imprisonment, confiscation of property, public flogging, cutting off the palm of the hand, the ears or the nose, impalement or crucifying people by driving down nails on their chests to trees, and such like, too abhorrent to record here. END of QUOTE.\n\nAll rulers of Travancore, since the reign of King Marthanda Varma are dealt in reasonable detail. Swathi Thirunal’s (King Rama Varma) tragic life has been mentioned.\n\nFrom the perspective of modern Indian history and sociology writings, this book has many issues which can make it a disturbance. The main problem is that it is written in a sort of impartial and non-jingoistic manner. \n\nThe writing of this book has been done from a most impartial manner with regard to caste and social issues. Even though Nagam Aiya is a Brahmin, there has been no attempt to portray any group or castes as above blame. In fact, the detailing is so honest, that not many modern Travancorians would actually like to recommend this book to anyone for a detailed reading. \n\nThe various false aspirations and claims of the various castes and the tragic sides of their lives have been portrayed with rare honesty. \n\nThe general culture of official corruption rampant in Travancore bureaucracy, which was more or less hereditary caste-based in mentioned in raw words. \nThe lower castes are also not mentioned in a praiseworthy manner. \n\nThe next item of jingoistic reproach would be the very obvious support to the English colonial rule. This feature can be felt in many pages dealing with the colonial times in the subcontinent. In the very introduction of the book, Nagam Aiya mentions thus: \n\nQUOTE: ultimate success of the English East India Company, our early friendships with them and the staunch support which they in return uniformly gave us through all vicissitudes of fortune, ultimately resulting in a strong bond of political alliance and reciprocal trust and confidence, which assured to us internal security and immunity from external aggression, thus enabling us to achieve the triumphs of peace and good government, until step by step we reached the enviable height of being known as the Model Native State’ of India END OF QUOTE\n\nKing Marthanda Varma’s words on his deathbed: QUOTE: That, above all, the friendship existing between the English East India Company and Travancore should be maintained at any risk, and that full confidence should always be placed in the support and aid of that honourable association.\" END OF QUOTE is also mentioned in the book. \n\nThese kind of writings found in various parts of the book as well as other items of a similar kind does lend support to the feeling that Nagam Aiya was supportive of the English rulers in the neighbouring Madras Presidency. \n\nAnother item that can disturb modern folks in south Kerala would be the details given about the social revolts by the lower castes, such as the Ezhava, Shanars, Pulaya, Pariah etc. for social and political freedom. Enough and more historical incidences are mentioned that point to the fact that this social upheaval was the handiwork of the English Missionaries from the London Missionary Society. Beyond that it is seen mentioned that each time such social problems happened, the English officials from Madras exerted pressure on the raja family to give the freedom that was demanded by the lower castes. \n\nHowever, Nagam Aiya does hint that the English rulers did not understand the social issues correctly. That even when the lower castes were given some freedom that had not been traditionally given to them, they used the occasion to go beyond what was allowed, and create social problems and rioting.\nThe history of such incidences could more or less deprive the claims of some lower castes leaders that they were the persons who had spearheaded the social revolution in Travancore. \n\nAnother item that can be actively disliked is the statement that Malayalam, the erstwhile language of Travancore kingdom, and currently the state language of Kerala, is of very recent origin. \n\nQUOTE: Another fact disclosed by the statements already given is that the language of most of the inscriptions is Tamil. The reason here is equally simple. Malayalam as a national language is not very old. Its resemblance to old Tamil is so patent that one could hardly help concluding that Malayalam is nothing more than old Tamil with a good admixture of Sanskrit words. END of QUOTE.\n\nIn fact, there is a strong hint that the actual antiquity of Travancore is Tamil. Almost all the stone inscriptions mentioned in the book are in Tamil, with a few in Sanskrit. \n\nSultan Tippu (Tipu Sulthaan), who is revered by some as a great freedom fighter, is not mentioned in the superlative.\n\nReference\n\nThe print version of \"Travancore State Manual\" is available. However, the original book can be downloaded as a digitalised scanned version from archive dot org. LINK\nAnother very readable digital book is also available on archive dot org, with a very curious commentary inside it.
