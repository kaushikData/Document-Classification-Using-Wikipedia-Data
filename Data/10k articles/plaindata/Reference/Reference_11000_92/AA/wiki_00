Registries may be free or charge fees, be facilitated by non-profit organizations, government agencies or private businesses.\n\nGenerally, such adoption registries exist only in countries which practiced \"closed adoption\", i.e. adoption in which the full identities of the birth parents, birth family members and the adopting family are not readily disclosed.\n\nSome reunion registries are based on mutual consent and do matches from the information provided by the registrants. Others, run by governmental agencies, have access to the original documents identifying a birth family or adopting family. This is a form of adoption disclosure. In general, adoptees must be adults before they may be given identifying information, or at least age 18. In the United States, state law governs whether such an institution may release this identifying information to the interested party. Some states have an adoption registry, in which both the adopted adult and birthparent must register before information will be provided. In other states, if the adoptee requests information, the organization will contact the birth parent and request consent for a reunion.\n\nIn Canada, adult adoptees from British Columbia, Newfoundland, and Ontario generally have access to their own birth and adoption information provided no disclosure veto has been filed. In other provinces/territories, limited access to information is allowed; all jurisdictions have some form of reunion register. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, adoption law has been amended to allow for open adoptions, the right to access one's records, and a state-run adoption reunion registry has been established.\n\nThough many such registries are operated by government agencies, many private registries do exist, and can be found on the Web. These tend to be owned and/or managed by members of the adoption community and are generally more successful than government-run registries. The largest such organization is the International Soundex Reunion Registry, Inc., (ISRR) founded in 1975. \n\nA problem generally with state-run registries has been the lack of publicity surrounding them. In contrast, in April 2005, the state-run National Adoption Contact Preference Register was launched in Ireland with a national radio and newspaper advertising campaign, and included an application form for the registry being delivered to every household. The Irish registry allows a person using it to specify whether or not they want contact and/or reunion, what form that contact should take (e.g., letter, phone, e-mail), and, if they do not want contact at the time being, still allows for the passing of medical and/or background information to the other party.\n\n"}

The documentary format used in this episode was later revisited for the fourth-season episode \"The Illusion of Truth\".\n\nCynthia Torqueman, a reporter for the ISN network on Earth, is the host of an ISN news series called \"36 Hours\". As the episode begins Torqueman is seen sitting at her anchor desk at ISN headquarters; she announces that the next segment of \"36 Hours\" will feature the Babylon 5 station and whether it is worthwhile for the Earth Alliance to continue funding and supporting the station. A number of public opinion polls are shown throughout the episode; the polls indicate that humanity's support for the Babylon 5 project is dwindling as the station's proclaimed mission of \"creating the peace\" falters. A key theme of the \"36 Hours\" segment is the ongoing Narn-Centauri War. As Torqueman's ship approaches the station, its cameras record Narn and Centauri merchant ships opening fire on one another. Torqueman interviews Dr. Stephen Franklin, Babylon 5's medical chief, who is obviously irritated by her questions as he rushes to save the lives of various Narn and Centauri who have been wounded in the battle.\n\nTorqueman spends most of her time on Babylon 5 interviewing the station's human command staff, its leading alien ambassadors, and talking with ordinary humans on the station (such as dockworkers). She also interviews an Earth Alliance Senator named Ronald Quantrell, who equivocates on the Project's success and claims that Earth only supported the station immediately after the Earth–Minbari War, when Earth's weakness forced it to promote galactic peace. Quantrell claims that, since the Earth Alliance has rebuilt and improved its military forces to a much greater strength since the war, the Alliance no longer needs to promote galactic peace or fund the expensive Babylon 5 station. His comments are strongly criticized by Captain John Sheridan, Babylon 5's commanding officer, who argues that Earth still doesn't have the level of technology to fight the Minbari, Centauri, or \"god forbid\" the Vorlons, and that Babylon 5 is still the \"last, best hope for peace\" in the galaxy. However, Sheridan's message is belied by the continued fighting between the Narn and Centauri. Ambassador G'Kar of the Narn claims that the Centauri have been using Babylon 5 (supposedly neutral territory) to load illegal mass driver weapons onto their merchant ships to attack the Narn. Ambassador Londo Mollari of the Centauri Republic disputes this and claims that the Narn are lying. Both ambassadors are interviewed by Torqueman; G'Kar tells her of the Centauri occupation and enslavement of his homeworld, and of his people's determination to never let it happen again. Londo tells Torqueman that the Centauri only occupied Narn to \"help\" the Narn raise their standard of living and claims that his people \"voluntarily\" left Narn when they were asked to do so. Torqueman also interviews Delenn, the Minbari Ambassador, and quizzes her about her physical change into a Minbari/Human hybrid, asking pointedly if it is not an insult to the memory of those who died in the Earth-Minbari War; Delenn is so upset that she cannot finish the interview. Torqueman also gets a first-ever televised glimpse of Kosh, the reclusive Vorlon ambassador, but he refuses to talk with her.\n\nWhen Sheridan tells Ambassador Mollari that he has ordered all Centauri merchant vessels to be searched for illegal weapons, Mollari tells him that this \"violation\" of the Centauri's sovereign rights will not be tolerated. Shortly afterward, a Centauri Primus-Class battlecruiser exits hyperspace directly above Babylon 5 and targets its weapons on the station. Mollari announces that the battlecruiser will blockade Babylon 5 unless Sheridan revokes his order to search Centauri ships. Sheridan believes the Centauri are bluffing and to prove it, he sends a single merchant ship past the Centauri battlecruiser. When the battlecruiser doesn't fire and allows the merchant vessel to leave unharmed, the crew in the command center applauds their commander's seeming victory. However, a Narn G'Quan-Class Heavy Cruiser exits hyperspace and attacks the Centauri battlecruiser. A fierce battle erupts between the two ships; Sheridan tries to get the ships to stop fighting, but to no avail. The Narn cruiser destroys the Centauri cruiser, but is heavily damaged in the process. When it tries to flee, its jump engines explode and the Narn cruiser is destroyed. Torqueman concludes the segment of \"36 Hours\" by stating that, while Babylon 5 is definitely a dangerous place and will continue to be a source of controversy and conflict, it should also be given more time to fulfill the dreams of its founders.\n\n\n"}

Now out of service, the aqueduct has been listed as a Monument historique since 1953. It was a part of the hydraulic network intended to provide water for the château de Marly and the Gardens of Versailles from the Seine river, using a huge pump called the \"Machine de Marly\".\n\nThe aqueduct consists of 36 arches. Its length is 643m for a width varying from 2 to 4.4m, and a height from 10 to 20 metres.\n\nIt was built by Jules Hardouin-Mansard, then Robert de Cotte, from 1681 to 1685. A monumental machine, called the machine de Marly, situated on the Seine river at Bougival, pumped water out of the river with the help of 14 paddle wheels. By pipes put on two paved inclines, the water was pumped up the 126 metres of the hill of Louveciennes. The water flowed into the reservoir at the summit of the tour du Levant (\"East tower\") at the north-eastern end of the aqueduct. Using gravity by a one metre wide and two metres deep canal, sealed inside with lead, the water was directed toward the tour du Jongleur (\"tower of the Juggler\") at the southern end of the aqueduct. From there, a siphon ensured the supply of a reservoir called réservoir des Deux Portes and the nearby tanks of Marly and Louveciennes.\n\nThe aqueduct was retired from service in 1866 and replaced by underground pipes.\n\nDuring the Siege of Paris (1870-1871), the tour du Levant was used as an observation point by the future German emperor William I and the chancellor Bismarck. This tower was renovated between 1998 and 2000.\n\n\n"}

Jacksons applied for an order that the furniture was not subject to the lessor's tacit hypothec; in other words, that the furniture had been brought to the premises without Jacksons's consent.\n\nThe court held that the furniture was indeed subject to the lessor's tacit hypothec. Had Jacksons taken reasonable steps to protect its property and to enquire as to its whereabouts, and as to where the purchaser was living, it could not have failed to obtain the necessary information, enabling it to give due notice to the new landlord. It had ample time to do this; under the circumstances, the inevitable inference was that the company had impliedly consented to the furniture's being subject to the tacit hypothec of the landlord. The furniture, therefore, had rightly been attached in execution.\n\n\n"}

Street S.E., in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C., United States of America. \"Chair\" was originally surveyed as part of the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey in 1994. It was once considered the world's largest chair, but has been overtaken by works like \"Broken Chair\" in Geneva and the temporary \"The Writer\" on Hampstead Heath in London.\n\nThe chair, which stands 19 1/2 feet high, is a detail-to-detail replica of a Duncan Phyfe style chair. Painted brown with a white and brown striped \"cushion\", the chair is entirely made of aluminum. Weighing between 4,000 and 4,600 pounds, the chair sits on a concrete base.\n\nThe chair was built in 1959 by Virginia-based furniture maker Bassett Furniture. The concept for the chair came from Charles Curtis, of the Curtis Brothers Furniture company, as a clever way to bring customers to their family showroom which was located on the grounds where the chair is currently placed.\n\nThe piece was dedicated on July 11, 1959, and a plaque was placed with it, stating:\n\nJohn Kidwell, the caretaker of the Chair, frequently patched holes that would form after heavy rains with cement. During the days of August 23–24, 2005, the original Chair was disassembled by a backhoe and taken away for restoration. Made entirely of Honduras Mahogany, the legs had begun to rot. On April 25, 2006, the chair was returned by Curtis Properties (was Curtis Brothers), however, this was a new chair, made entirely of brown aluminum. Over 250 people attended the re-dedication including Mayor Anthony A. Williams.\n\nWith the dedication of a new chair, a new plaque was placed, reading:\n\nThis new chair was designed by Devery Lomax managed by John Kidwell. It was fabricated by Cinnbar, an Orlando-based business known for their oversized objects, and Nelson's Welding. The new chair cost over $40,000 to build. Upon its delivery, by flatbed truck, overpasses had to be avoided due to the size of the chair.\n\nOn August 13, 1960, Rebecca Kirby (aka Lynn Arnold) moved \"onto\" the chair. A 10-by-10-foot cubicle was built and placed on the seat, furnished with a shower, bed, toilet, heater, air conditioner and balcony. Placed upon the chair by way of forklift, Kirby lived in the chair for 42 days. In the cubicle, she would watch TV, read books, and talk on the telephone, as well as dine, as her meals were delivered every day.\n\nKirby would step outside onto the balcony every few hours to greet visitors who learned about her living situation due to newspapers advertising her as \"Alice in the Looking Glass House\". Visitors would be encouraged to guess how long she'd maintain her residency. Her then 14-month-old son, Richard, visited often, being placed in a dumb waiter and sent up to see her.\n\nAfter 42 days, Kirby \"decided to return to earth,\" earning $1,500 for her stay.\n\nThe Chair has been received as a part of neighborhood life since its original installation. Anacostia, a neighborhood that has seen economic and cultural ups and downs prides itself on a landmark that withstands the community's evolution.\n\nThe Chair is often used as a geographic marker for direction giving and holiday celebration; Santa Claus sits upon the chair during Christmas. When the Chair was reinstalled in 2006, community members surrounded the giant, clapping, yelling and photographing the new chair.\n\nDuring the 1968 Washington, D.C. riots the Chair was one of the few landmarks to go unscathed in a neighborhood heavily affected by Martin Luther King, Jr.'s death.\n\n"}

Boards are standardized to 3U or 6U sizes, and are typically interconnected via a passive backplane. The connector pin assignments are standardized by the PICMG US and PICMG Europe organizations. The connectors and the electrical rules allow for eight boards in a PCI segment. Multiple bus segments are allowed with bridges.\n\nUnlike the original Eurocard solutions such as VME, which use connectors with a 0.1 inch (2.54 mm) pin spacing, CompactPCI cards use metric connectors with a 2-millimeter pin spacing, designed to the IEC 1076 standard. 3U boards have a 110-pin connector (J1), which carries the 32-bit PCI bus signals, and an optional 110-pin connector (J2), which carries either user-defined I/O or the upper 32 bits of an optional 64-bit PCI bus. 6U cards have an identical J1, a J2 that is always used for 64-bit PCI, as well as J3, J4, and J5 connectors for a variety of uses either as user-defined I/O or specified signaling such as Telephony and/or Ethernet signaling. Hot-plugging is a supported feature of CompactPCI. Some of the pins are slightly longer to provide proper grounding when devices are inserted and removed.\n\nThe backplanes can be designed for 3.3 V VIO or 5 V VIO operation. These are differentiated by having 'Cadmium Yellow' coloured key for 3.3V or 'Brilliant Blue' colour for 5V operation. If the CompactPCI card operates on a particular VIO voltage the card shall have the respective coloured coding key. If the card is compatible with both voltages then it may not have any coding key. The image above illustrates a 5 V VIO 8-slot backplane.\n\nCompactPCI was initially ratified as PICMG 2.0 in late 1995 as a passive backplane for PCI signaling. The 2.x series of specifications from PICMG provide support for a variety of technologies including Hot Swap (PICMG 2.1), Telephony signaling (PICMG 2.5) and most notably the expansion of the architecture to include switched Ethernet (PICMG 2.16).\n\nOriginally designed to support the PCI signaling protocol (and hence the name \"CompactPCI\"), CompactPCI has grown to include a variety of technologies centered on the application of the 2mm HM connector on the 3U and 6U form factor. In fact many systems are implemented with no PCI bus on the backplane, such as those implemented with switched Ethernet board interconnection (PICMG 2.16).\n\nA drawback of the design is that the signal pins can become bent when a new device is inserted.\n\nRelated standards include CompactPCI Express and CompactPXI, which follow a similar concept, but substitute the protocols and signaling of PCI Express and PXI respectively.\n\nThe abbreviations cPCI, CPCI, cPCIe, and CPCIe are colloquial terms and are not officially used by PICMG.\n\n\n"}

They usually also preserve written materials from a great variety of independent local organisations, churches and schools, prominent families and their estates, businesses, solicitors' offices and ordinary private individuals. \n\nArchives may have been acquired either through donation or (more generally) by deposit on long-term loan. Local authorities in certain larger cities sometimes administer their own separate city record office, operating along similar lines. Archive repositories are frequently – but by no means exclusively – used by local and family historians for the purposes of original research, since many records can very often have a continuing administrative or legal significance.\n\nA record office will typically include public searchrooms (including reference books, archive catalogues and other finding aids), environmentally controlled strongrooms, administrative offices, and quite often small exhibition areas together with a conservation room for the specialist repair of documents. Searchrooms are generally open at their advertised times without charge, although many offices operate a reader's ticket system. Some, but not all, operate a fee-paying postal service for those who are unable to make personal research visits. All county record offices attempt to work in accordance with the appropriate official British Standard.\n\nThe earliest county record office in the modern sense was the Bedfordshire Record Office, established by George Herbert Fowler in 1913. To some extent it was operating within established traditions set by the London-based Public Record Office (now The National Archives), which first opened in 1838, or by other repositories overseas. Although the statutory operation of such county record offices under the Local Government (Records) Act 1962 was permissive rather than mandatory, the network has gradually expanded. Bristol Record Office (now Bristol Archives), opened in 1924, has been identified as the second local office to become established. The whole network now includes repositories – which operate largely independently of each other – throughout the whole of England and Wales (the most recent being Powys Archives, opened in the 1980s). Often the foundations of many of the earlier collections were the extensive surviving archives originating from a county's quarter sessions – in the county of Somerset a special muniment room had actually been provided for these as early as 1617. There are also many broadly similar repositories in Scotland, Ireland, and overseas. To varying extents they will also help with the care of the county's semi-current or \"modern records\" using records management principles, as well as with the selection and preservation of today's records (both paper and digital) for future generations.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries some older libraries had also begun to maintain archive collections from their local area, although their facilities and the scope of their collections could vary considerably – as might their official legal status. There are often overlaps between local studies and record office collections, particularly with respect to printed ephemera, maps, photographs, old newspapers and local reference books. A number of record offices now operate in a formal association with one or more of their county’s principal local studies libraries, although the two professions of archivist and librarian generally remain quite distinct.\n\nPublic access to central government archives (technically known as Public Records) and by extension to local government records was previously regulated in accordance with instruments such as the Public Records Act 1958 and the Public Records Act 1967. The 1958 Act enabled county repositories to be appointed by the Lord Chancellor to hold individually specified classes of Public Records – including local court records. Access to material within record offices in England & Wales is now largely regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, although these do not necessarily cover privately deposited items, and closure periods may apply in certain cases.\n\nSince 1929 many county record offices in England have also been designated by the local bishop as a diocesan record office, latterly operating under the terms of the Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978. Such record offices are often also formally recognised by the Master of the Rolls as approved repositories for manorial and tithe records (in accordance with the Law of Property Act 1922 and the Tithe Act 1936 (as amended by the Local Government Records Act 1962).\n\nMany county record offices have issued printed guides to their collections, although the addition of new materials can make these go rapidly out of date. Furthermore, many offices also have considerable backlogs of uncatalogued materials. From the 1990s onwards an increasing number of offices have launched online catalogues of varying completeness, linked to their respective websites.\n\nAn earlier summary of archive repositories, including brief details of the development of each office together with outlines of their principal holdings, is provided by Janet Foster and Julia Sheppard’s \"British Archives\" (4th edition, 2002). Select lists for certain specialised categories covering many UK repositories have also been issued by a variety of other publishers, notably the Federation of Family History Societies.\n\n"}

Alone, Wallechinsky went back to his school year and wrote a similar book \"Midterm Report: The Class of '65: Chronicles of an American Generation\" about pupils from across America who left high school in that year.\n\nIn 1973, Wallechinsky became fed up with almanacs that regurgitated bare facts. He had the idea for a reference book to be read for pleasure; a book that would tell the often untold true tales of history. He worked alone for 12 months before being joined by his father for a further year of research. \"The People's Almanac\" was published by Doubleday in 1975 and became a best-seller. One of the most popular chapters was a selection of lists and, joined by his father and sister, Wallechinsky wrote \"The Book of Lists\", which became an international best-seller. Both books spawned not only follow-up editions but innumerable copy titles such as \"The Ethnic Almanac\", \"The Jewish Almanac\", \"The Book Of TV Lists\", \"The Book Of Sex Lists\", etc.\n\nWallechinsky was taken to the Rome Olympic Games in 1960 by his father and a seed was germinated that later resulted in the seminal \"The Complete Book of the Olympics\", a reference work that contained full results and many anecdotes about the modern Games. The book became unwieldy so was later split into two volumes \"The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics\" and \"The Complete Book of the Winter Olympics\" series. Wallechinsky now shares the editorial duties with his nephew Jaime Loucky (b. Los Angeles 26 February 1981). The books led to work for Wallechinsky as an Olympic commentator for NBC.\n\nIn 1992 he was one of the founding members of the International Society of Olympic Historians (ISOH). He served as Treasurer of the ISOH from 1996 to 2004, Vice-President from 2004 to 2012 and is currently serving\na four-year term as the organization's President.\n\nWallechinsky is the founder of AllGov.com, which provides up-to-date news about more than 340 departments and agencies of the American government, most of which operate under the radar of the media, even when they have annual budgets of billions of dollars. AllGov tells you what each agency says it does, what it really does (in \"The People's Almanac\" Wallechinsky compiled a list of each country and had the topics \"Who Rules?\" and \"Who REALLY Rules?\"), and who is making a profit from the agency. It also gives a history of the agency, illuminates controversies relating to the agency and shares critiques and suggested reforms from both the left and the right.\n\nHe has compiled the list of \"The World’s 10 Worst Dictators\" for \"Parade\" magazine for the last several years. In 2006, this subject became a book entitled: \"Tyrants: The World’s 20 Worst Living Dictators\". These men are: \nOmar al-Bashir (Sudan), \nKim Jong-il (North Korea), \nThan Shwe (Burma), \nRobert Mugabe (Zimbabwe), \nIslam Karimov (Uzbekistan), \nHu Jintao (China), \nKing Abdullah (Saudi Arabia), \nSaparmurat Niyazov (Turkmenistan), \nSeyed Ali Khamanei (Iran), \nTeodoro Obiang Nguema (Equatorial Guinea), \nMuammar Gaddafi (Libya), \nKing Mswati III (Swaziland), \nPervez Musharraf (Pakistan), \nAleksandr Lukashenko (Belarus), \nFidel Castro (Cuba), \nIsaias Afwerki (Eritrea), \nBashar al-Assad (Syria), \nMeles Zenawi (Ethiopia), \nPaul Biya (Cameroon), and \nChoummaly Sayasone (Laos). \nThere is a 21st chapter on the \"special case\" of George W. Bush (USA), which is not mentioned on the book's US cover.\n\nWallechinsky is a vegetarian and is married to Flora Chavez. They have two sons: Elijah Chavez Wallechinsky (b. Los Angeles, June 3, 1983) and Aaron Chavez Wallechinsky (b. West Park Hospital, Canoga Park, Los Angeles, January 5, 1986). Both brothers are avid photographers and designers. Wallechinsky splits his time between Santa Monica, California and the south of France.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3001378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3001378", "title": "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains", "text": "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains\n\nDwelling in the Fuchun Mountains () is one of the few surviving works by the painter Huang Gongwang (1269–1354) and it is considered to be among his greatest works. Painted between 1348 and 1350, the Chinese landscape painting was burnt into two pieces in 1650. Today, one piece is kept in the Zhejiang Provincial Museum in Hangzhou, while the other piece is kept in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. The entire painting combined would measure 691.3 cm in length.\n\n\"Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains\" is considered one of the greatest surviving masterpieces by the highly acclaimed Chinese painter Huang Gongwang (1269–1354). He began serious studies in painting only at the age of 50. In 1347, he moved to the Fuchun Mountains (southwest of Hangzhou, along the northern bank of the Fuchun River), where he spent the last years of his life. There he made a number of paintings on the natural landscape, among them \"Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains\", which depicting the scenery in Tonglu County.\n\nIt was \"carefully designed and developed in layers of wet washes and brush strokes, giving a convincing appearance of off hand but inspired organisation and of spontaneous ink-play in detail\"—two techniques with which Huang Gongwang is associated, later influencing such artists as Wang Yuanqi, one of the 'Six Masters of the Early Qing'. He presented it to a Taoist priest as a gift in 1350. A century later, the painting was somehow acquired by the Ming Dynasty painter Shen Zhou (1427–1509). During the reign of the Chenghua Emperor (1465–1487), Shen Zhou sent the painting to an unnamed calligrapher to be inscribed (a curious point considering Shen Zhou was an excellent calligrapher himself). However, the son of this calligrapher seized the painting which, after a few changes of hands, reemerged on the market being sold at a high price. Unable to afford the price, there was nothing Shen Zhou could do except to make a copy of the painting himself. This imitation by Shen Zhou has become the most well-known and acclaimed copy among all others.\n\nNot long after he made the copy, Shen Zhou gave it to a bureaucrat friend named Fan Shunju (樊舜举). Fan Shunju then began to search for the authentic copy. When he found it, he bought it at a hefty price and invited Shen Zhou to inscribe on it. Shen Zhou then noted down at the end of the scroll the story of how the painting was lost and found.\n\nOver the following centuries, the painting had come to know several owners, including Tan Zhiyi (谈志伊), Dong Qichang (董其昌) and Wu Zhengzhi (吴正志). When Wu Zhengzhi died, he passed the painting to his third son Wu Hongyu (吴洪裕), who loved the painting so much that when he went on refuge, he left behind all valuables and only brought the painting and a copy of the \"Thousand Character Classic\" by Master Zhiyong (智永法师). In fact, he was so fond of these two pieces of work that he had them burnt shortly before he died, so that he could bring them to the afterlife.\n\nFortunately, Wu Hongyu's nephew Wu Jing'an rescued the painting, which was however already aflame and torn into two. The smaller piece, also the beginning section, measuring 51.4 centimeters long, was subsequently known as \"The Remaining Mountain\" (剩山圖). After passing through the hands of numerous collectors, it came to the possession of Wu Hufan (吴湖帆), painter and collector, during the 1940s. In 1956, it finally settled down in the Zhejiang Provincial Museum in Hangzhou.\n\nThe journey of the latter longer section, measuring 636.9 centimeters long, known as \"The Master Wuyong Scroll\" (無用師卷), was perhaps more dramatic. It passed through the hands of several high-level government officials, including Gao Shiqi (高士奇) and Wang Hongxu (王鸿绪), before landing in the Imperial Palace. Ironically, the Qianlong Emperor, who prided himself in his connoisseurship, judged that this new acquisition was counterfeit and insisted that the imitation he already possessed was authentic. This mistake was only corrected in 1816, during the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor. The longer piece was taken to Taiwan during the 1950s and is now at the National Palace Museum in Taipei.\n\nIn 2011, the first section of the painting was loaned to the National Palace Museum in Taipei where, in June and July, the two pieces were reunited for the first time since their separation more than three and a half centuries ago. The exhibition attracted 847,509 visitors and became one of the most popular art show in 2011.\n\n\nIn 2013's Chinese film \"Switch\", the hero (Andy Lau) is tasked to recover the stolen painting.\n\n"}

{"id": "29028054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29028054", "title": "Idris (prophet)", "text": "Idris (prophet)\n\nʾIdrīs () is an ancient prophet and patriarch mentioned in the Qur'an, whom Muslims believe was the second prophet after Adam. Islamic tradition has unanimously identified Idris with the biblical Enoch, although many Muslim scholars of the classical and medieval periods also held that Idris and Hermes Trismegistus were the same person.\n\nHe is described in the Qur'an as \"trustworthy\" and \"patient\" and the Qur'an also says that he was \"exalted to a high station\". Because of this and other parallels, traditionally Idris has been identified with the Biblical Enoch, and Islamic tradition usually places Idris in the early Generations of Adam, and considers him one of the oldest prophets mentioned in the Qur'an, placing him between Adam and Noah. Idris' unique status inspired many future traditions and stories surrounding him in Islamic lore.\n\nAccording to \"hadith\", narrated by Malik ibn Anas and found in \"Sahih Muslim\", it is said that on Muhammad's Night Journey, he encountered Idris in the fourth heaven. The traditions that have developed around the figure of Idris have given him the scope of a prophet as well as a philosopher and mystic, and many later Muslim mystics, or Sufis, including Ruzbihan Baqli and Ibn Arabi, also mentioned having encountered Idris in their spiritual visions.\n\nThe name \"Idris\", , has been described as perhaps having the origin of meaning \"interpreter.\" Traditionally, Islam holds the prophet as having functioned an interpretive and mystical role and therefore this meaning garnered a general acceptance. Later Muslim sources, those of the eighth century, began to hold that Idris had two names, \"Idris\" and \"Enoch,\" and other sources even stated that \"Idris' true name is Enoch and that he is called Idris in Arabic because of his devotion to the study of the sacred books of his ancestors Adam and Seth.\" Therefore, these later sources also highlighted Idris as either meaning \"interpreter\" or having some meaning close to that of an interpretive role. Several of the classical commentators on the Qur'an, such as Al-Baizawi, said he was \"called \"Idris\" from the Arabic \"dars\", meaning \"to instruct,\" from his knowledge of divine mysteries.\"\n\nIdris's father was Yarid (Arabic يريد) and his mother was Barkanah. Idris's wife was a woman named Aadanah. Idris also had a son whose name was Methuselah; who would eventually be the grandfather of Prophet Nuh (Noah). This means that Idris was the great-grandfather of Noah.\n\nIdris is mentioned twice in the Qur'an, where he is described as a wise man. In chapter 19 of the Qur'an, God says: \nLater, in chapter 21, Idris is again praised: \nIdris was born in Babylon, a city in present-day Iraq. Before he received the Revelation, he followed the rules revealed to Prophet Seth, the son of Adam. When Idris grew older, Allah bestowed Prophethood on him. During his lifetime all the people were Muslim; no one associated partners with Allah. Afterwards, Idris left his hometown of Babylon because a great number of his people committed many sins even after he told them not to do so. Some of the Muslims left with Idris. It was hard for them to leave their home.\n\nThey asked Prophet Idris: \"If we leave Babylon, where will we find a place like it?\" Prophet Idris said: \"If we immigrate for the sake of Allah, He will provide for us.\" So the people went with Prophet Idris and they reached the land of Egypt. They saw the Nile River. Idris stood at its bank and mentioned Allah, the Exalted, by saying: \"Subhanallah.\"\n\nIslamic literature narrates that Idris was made prophet at around 40, which parallels the age when Muhammad began to prophesy, and lived during a time when people had begun to worship fire. Exegesis embellishes upon the lifetime of Idris, and states that the prophet divided his time into two. For three days of the week, Idris would preach to his people and four days he would devote solely to the worship of God. Many early commentators, such as Tabari, credited Idris with possessing great wisdom and knowledge. \n\nExegesis narrates that Idris was among \"the first men to use the pen as well as being one of the first men to observe the movement of the stars and set out scientific weights and measures.\" These attributes remain consistent with the identification of Enoch with Idris, as these attributes make it clear that Idris would have most probably lived during the Generations of Adam, the same era during which Enoch lived. Ibn Arabi described Idris as the \"prophet of the philosophers\" and a number of works were attributed to him. Some scholars wrote commentaries on these supposed works, all while Idris was also credited with several inventions, including the art of making garments.\n\nThe commentator Ibn Ishaq narrated that he was the first man to write with a pen and that he was born when Adam still had 308 years of his life to live. In his commentary on the Quranic verses 19:56-57, the commentator Ibn Kathir narrated \"During the Night Journey, the Prophet passed by him in fourth heaven. In a hadith, Ibn Abbas asked Ka’b what was meant by the part of the verse which says, ”And We raised him to a high station.” Ka’b explained: Allah revealed to Idris: ‘I would raise for you every day the same amount of the deeds of all Adam’s children’ – perhaps meaning of his time only. So Idris wanted to increase his deeds and devotion. A friend of his from the angels visited and Idris said to him: ‘Allah has revealed to me such and such, so could you please speak to the angel of death, so I could increase my deeds.’ The angel carried him on his wings and went up into the heavens. When they reached the fourth heaven, they met the angel of death, who was descending down towards earth. The angel spoke to him, about what Idris had spoken to him before. The angel of death said: ‘But where is Idris?’ He replied, ‘He is upon my back.’ The angel of death said: ‘How astonishing! I was sent and told to seize his soul in the fourth heaven. I kept thinking how I could seize it in the fourth heaven when he was on the earth?’ Then he took his soul out of his body, and that is what is meant by the verse: ‘And We raised him to a high station.’\n\nEarly accounts of Idris' life attributed \"thirty portions of revealed scripture\" to him. Therefore, Idris was understood by many early commentators to be both a prophet as well as a messenger. Several modern commentators have linked this sentiment with Biblical apocrypha such as the Book of Enoch and the Second Book of Enoch.\n\nIdris is generally accepted to be the same as Enoch. Many of the early Qur'anic commentators, such as Tabari and Al-Baizawi identified Idris with Enoch. Al-Baizawi said: \"Idris was of the posterity of Seth and a forefather of Noah, and his name was Enoch (ar. \"Uhnukh\")\"\nClassical commentators used to popularly identify Idris with Enoch, the patriarch who lived in the Generations of Adam. An example is İsmail Hakkı Bursevî's commentary on \"Fusus al-hikam\" by Muhyiddin ibn ʻArabi. Modern scholars, however, do not concur with this identification because they argue that it lacks definitive proof. As Qur'anic translator Abdullah Yusuf Ali says in note 2508 of his translation:\n\nSayyid Ahmed Amiruddin has pointed out that Hermes Trismegistus is the builder of the Pyramids of Giza and has a major place in Islamic tradition. He writes, \"Hermes Trismegistus is mentioned in the Quran in verse 19:56-57:\"Mention, in the Book, Idris, that he was truthful, a prophet. We took him up to a high place\". The Jabirian corpus contains the oldest documented source for the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, translated by Jābir ibn Hayyān (Geber) for the Hashemite Caliph of Baghdad Harun al-Rashid the Abbasid. Jābir ibn Hayyān, a Shiite, identified as Jābir al-Sufi, was a student of Ja'far al-Sadiq, Husayn ibn 'Ali's great grandson. Thus, for the Abbasid's and the Alid's, the writings of Hermes Trismegistus were considered sacred, as an inheritance from the Ahl al-Bayt and the Prophets. These writings were recorded by the Ikhwan al-Safa, and subsequently translated from Arabic into Persian, Turkish, Hebrew, Russian, and English. In these writings, Hermes Trismegistus is identified as Idris, the infallible Prophet who traveled to outer space from Egypt, and to heaven, whence he brought back a cache of objects from the Eden of Adam and the Black Stone from where he landed on earth in India.\n\nAccording to ancient Arab genealogists, the Prophet Muhammad, who is also believed to have traveled to the heavens on the night of Isra and Mi'raj, is a direct descendant of Hermes Trismegistus. Ibn Kathir said, \"As for Idris...He is in the genealogical chain of the Prophet Muhammad, except according to one genealogist...Ibn Ishaq says he was the first who wrote with the Pen. There was a span of 380 years between him and the life of Adam. Many of the scholars allege that he was the first to speak about this, and they call him Thrice-Great Hermes [Hermes Trismegistus]\". Ahmad al-Buni considered himself a follower of the hermetic teachings; and his contemporary Ibn Arabi mentioned Hermes Trismegistus in his writings. The Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya of Ibn Arabi speaks of Hermes's travels to \"vast cities (outside earth), possessing technologies far superior then ours\" and meeting with the Twelfth Imam, the Ninth (generation) from the Third (al-Husayn the third Imam), who also ascended to the heavens, and is still alive like his ancestor Hermes Trismegistus\".\n\nA late Arabic writer wrote of the Sabaeans that their religion had a sect of star worshipers who held their doctrine to come from Hermes Trismegistus through the prophet Adimun.\n\nAntoine Faivre, in \"The Eternal Hermes\" (1995), has pointed out that Hermes Trismegistus has a place in the Islamic tradition, although the name \"Hermes\" does not appear in the \"Qur'an\". Hagiographers and chroniclers of the first centuries of the Islamic Hegira quickly identified Hermes Trismegistus with Idris, the \"nabi\" of surahs 19.57 and 21.85, whom the \"Arabs\" also identified with Enoch (cf. Genesis 5.18–24). Idris/Hermes was termed \"Thrice-Wise\" Hermes Trismegistus because he had a threefold origin. The first Hermes, comparable to Thoth, was a \"civilizing hero\", an initiator into the mysteries of the divine science and wisdom that animate the world; he carved the principles of this sacred science in hieroglyphs. The second Hermes, in Babylon, was the initiator of Pythagoras. The third Hermes was the first teacher of alchemy. \"A faceless prophet,\" writes the Islamicist Pierre Lory, \"Hermes possesses no concrete or salient characteristics, differing in this regard from most of the major figures of the Bible and the Quran.\" A common interpretation of the representation of \"Trismegistus\" as \"thrice great\" recalls the three characterizations of Idris: as a messenger of god, or a prophet; as a source of wisdom, or \"hikmet\" (wisdom from \"hokmah\"); and as a king of the world order, or a \"sultanate\". These are referred to as \"müselles bin ni'me\".\n\nBahá'u'lláh, founder of the Bahá'í Faith, wrote in one of his tablets: \nThe first person who devoted himself to philosophy was Idris. Thus was he named. Some called him also Hermes. In every tongue he hath a special name. He it is who hath set forth in every branch of philosophy thorough and convincing statements. After him Balínús derived his knowledge and sciences from the Hermetic Tablets and most of the philosophers who followed him made their philosophical and scientific discoveries from his words and statements...\n\nDue to the linguistic dissimilarities of the name \"Idris\" with the aforementioned figures, several historians have proposed that this Qur'anic figure is derived from \"Andreas\", the immortality-achieving cook from the Syriac Alexander romance. In addition, historian Patricia Crone proposes that both \"Idris\" and \"Andreas\" are derived from the Akkadian epic of Atra-Hasis.\n\n"}

He competed in Southeastern regional promotions and the National Wrestling Alliance during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. A mainstay of NWA Mid-America (later the Continental Wrestling Association), he served as a mentor to Jerry \"The King\" Lawler and The Fabulous Ones, among other wrestlers in the Memphis area. He was known for his blonde hair and \"Fargo Strut\" mannerism, and held 45 tag team championships during his career, with Don Fargo, Sonny \"Roughhouse\" Fargo, amongst others.\n\nFargo's first experience with wrestling was as a teenager at the YMCA in Goldsboro, North Carolina; after he took part in the state championships, a local promoter suggested that Fargo could earn more money by switching to professional wrestling. Fargo was trained at the Quonset Auditorium in Bowling Green, Kentucky by Joe and Kenny Marshall, and first wrestled under the name \"Wild Man Fargo\". Fargo started his professional wrestling career around 1950 for Johnny Long in Atlanta. In 1952, Fargo wrestled in Cuba before serving in the Korean War. Fargo was a very successful tag team wrestler, having held tag team championships 45 times throughout his career. He formed a famous tag team with Don Fargo (real name Don Kalt) as the Fabulous Fargos; together they won the NWA World Tag Team titles in 1958 and dominated the National Wrestling Alliance during the late 1950s. Jackie and Don Fargo's match against Antonino Rocca and Miguel Pérez was witnessed by a record breaking 20,125 people at Madison Square Garden on March 30, 1957. Upon ceasing his tag team with Don Fargo, Jackie Fargo formed another tag team with his real-life brother, Sonny, also known in the ring as Roughhouse; this team also enjoyed success. Jim Cornette credits Fargo with popularising wild brawls and the use of tables and chairs in wrestling in the Tennessee area, which he sees as one of the origins of the later 'hardcore' wrestling style. During the 1960s, Fargo won the NWA Georgia Tag Team title with Joe Fargo and Mario Milano as well as enjoying numerous title reigns capturing the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship with Don Fargo, Lester Welch, Tex Riley, Mario Milano, Sonny Fargo, Len Rossi, Dennis Hall, Jerry Jarrett, Mr. Wrestling and the legendary Lou Thesz. Fargo was the originator of the \"Fargo Strut\". This charismatic walk in the ring has been copied by other professional wrestlers including Jerry Lawler, Jeff Jarrett and the Fabulous Ones. Although fellow wrestler Buddy Rogers also had a distinctive strut, Fargo claimed that he had never seen Rogers. A longtime mentor to many younger wrestlers in the Memphis area, he later became involved in a feud with former protégé Jerry Lawler who defeated Fargo in a handicap match with Jim White for the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship on March 28, 1973. Fargo later teamed with George Gulas and Tojo Yamamoto to capture the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship title several times during the early 1970s, becoming the first NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Champions along with Gulas and Dennis Hall in November 1973. In 1972, Fargo had a notorious feud with Al Greene, who once during the feud shaved off Fargo's blonde hair. Although retiring in 1980, he joined Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association to help The Fabulous Ones (Stan Lane and Steve Keirn) in their feud against The Moondogs before their departure in 1984 and retired shortly thereafter. On June 19, 2002, Fargo appeared on the first NWA-TNA Weekly pay per view along with other NWA legends. Fargo's last matches saw him wrestle both in 2004 and later 2006, at the age of 76.\n\nFargo was hospitalized with pneumonia in both lungs in December 2011. Fargo died on June 24, 2013, after being hospitalized for a week for congestive heart failure. Fargo was survived by three daughters, one grandson, two granddaughters and two great-grandchildren.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20926242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20926242", "title": "Liber Eliensis", "text": "Liber Eliensis\n\nThe Liber Eliensis is a 12th-century English chronicle and history, written in Latin. Composed in three books, it was written at Ely Abbey on the island of Ely in the fenlands of eastern Cambridgeshire. Ely Abbey became the cathedral of a newly formed bishopric in 1109. Traditionally the author of the anonymous work has been given as Richard or Thomas, two monks at Ely, one of whom, Richard, has been identified with an official of the monastery, but some historians hold that neither Richard nor Thomas was the author.\n\nThe \"Liber\" covers the period from the founding of the abbey in 673 until the middle of the 12th century, building on earlier historical works. It incorporates documents and stories of saints' lives. The work typifies a type of local history produced during the latter part of the 12th century. Similar books were written at other English monasteries. The longest of the contemporary local histories, the \"Liber\" chronicles the devastation that the Anarchy caused during the reign of King Stephen. It also documents the career of Nigel, the Bishop of Ely from 1133 to 1169, and his disputes with King Stephen. Other themes include the miracles worked by the monastery's patron saint, Æthelthryth, and gifts of land to Ely.\n\nTwo complete manuscripts survive, complemented by partial manuscripts. The Latin text was published in 1962, and an English translation followed in 2005. Extracts had appeared in print earlier.\n\nThe \"Liber Eliensis\" provides an important history of the region and period it covers, and particularly for the abbey and bishopric of Ely.\n\nThe \"Liber Eliensis\" was written at Ely Abbey, which became Ely Cathedral upon conversion into a bishopric in 1109. The historian Elisabeth van Houts believes that it was written in two stages: first under Bishop Hervey le Breton, in office from 1109 to 1133; and continued under Bishop Geoffrey Ridel, who served from 1173 to 1189. For van Houts, the first stage was the translation of an Old English work into Latin, commissioned by Bishop Hervey. The rest of the work, van Houts argues, was composed in the 1170s. However, E. O. Blake, who edited the first Latin printing of the work, concludes that the \"Liber\" was probably composed in three parts, based on its contents; the first book of the \"Liber\" was begun after 1131, when one of the sources used in the \"Liber\" was completed. The second has a preface apologising for the delay in its completion, and could not have been started before 1154, as it records events from that year. The third and final book was completed between 1169, when Bishop Nigel died and whose death is mentioned in the book, and 1174, when a new bishop was appointed. As there is no mention of Nigel's replacement, Blake states that this suggests that book three was finished before the new bishop took office.\n\nTraditionally the work was ascribed to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text. The historian Antonia Gransden is inclined to believe that the work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and prior of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194. Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a classicist and a recent translator of the \"Liber\", suggests that it may have been written by someone other than the traditional candidates. Whoever the author, the \"Liber\" specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.\n\nThe \"Liber\" is one of a number of monastic histories written during the middle and later 12th century, when a number of monasteries in northern and southern England produced works devoted to recording the histories of their religious houses and local areas. In the south, these included the \"Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis\" of Abingdon Abbey, the \"Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis\" of Ramsey Abbey, the \"Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense\" of Peterborough Abbey, a history of the see of Bath and Wells, and the \"Chronicon Monasterii de Bello\" of Battle Abbey. The northern histories record the foundation stories of the various Cistercian houses in the north, along with other information relating to those houses. Those from the south, including the \"Liber Eliensis\", mainly concern themselves with the various controversies involving their respective religious houses. The northern histories are less concerned with controversy, and overall are more prone to hagiography.\n\nTo a large extent the work is composite; that is, it is a compilation borrowing from or at least using earlier sources. These include the early medieval writer Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\", a chronicle that was associated with Bede's \"De temporum ratione\", the \"Chronicon ex chronicis\", and William of Poitiers' \"Gesta Guillelmi II ducis Normannorum\". Lesser-used sources include the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", Orderic Vitalis' \"Historia Ecclesiastica\", Stephen of Ripon's \"Vita Sancti Wilfrithi\", William of Malmesbury's \"Gesta pontificum Anglorum\", a list of the kings of Wessex, the Old English poem \"The Battle of Maldon\", and a number of saints' lives, including some written by Eadmer, Felix, Abbo of Fleury, Goscelin, and Osbern of Canterbury. The work on Maldon was included because the hero of the work was Byrhtnoth, a patron of the monastery.\n\nWorks more directly related to Ely were also used. The primary one of these works was Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester's \"Libellus\", large parts of which were copied into the \"Liber Eliensis\". Also incorporated into the \"Liber\" was an earlier \"Vita\", or saints' life, on Æthelthryth, the founder and first abbess of Ely. A work on the benefactors of the abbey was also used, and the material from three surviving cartularies. These documents were translated from their original Old English into Latin by the compiler. Another source, as related in the \"Liber\" itself, was a work about Hereward the Wake written by a brother monk known as Richard. Modern historians have identified it with the \"Gesta Herwardi\" known from a 13th-century manuscript. It is, however, unclear whether the compiler of the \"Liber\" used the exact text of the \"Gesta\" as it has come down to us, or a different, earlier manuscript.\n\nSome of these sources may originally have been oral works. A number of the stories in the narrative parts of the \"Liber\" resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King Cnut visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It is possible that the information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from orally transmitted tales that were written down.\n\nThe work is traditionally divided into three books. Along with the history in Book I the first section also contains a prologue and a preface. It discusses the founding of the Abbey of Ely and the background of the foundress, Æthelthryth. The first book also deals with the history of the abbey and its abbesses until the Danish invasions of the 9th century. A description of the destruction of the abbey by the Danes and of King Edgar's (reigned 959–975) rule concludes the book. The second book, Book II, begins with the restoration of the abbey during Edgar's reign, under Bishop Æthelwold. Accounts of the subsequent abbots until the last, Richard, are included in Book II, as well as numerous charters and other documents. The final book, Book III, contains information on the conversion of the abbey to a bishopric, and on the first few bishops; it concludes with a description of the martyrdom of Thomas Becket. Interspersed with the historical narrative are a number of documents and charters relating to the bishops.\n\nThe work also depicts the devastation that the Anarchy caused during King Stephen's reign. The chronicler states that failure of the harvest and pillaging caused a famine. The work describes the area around the abbey for as being filled with unburied corpses, and that the price of a bushel of grain rose to 200 pence. The long descriptions of Nigel of Ely's disputes with King Stephen lead to a discussion of the Battle of Lincoln and other matters not directly related to Ely. The \"Liber\" gives a detailed account of Nigel's career, although in general the chronicle's author favours Stephen over his own bishop. The ascension of King Henry II to the English throne is considered to be an excellent event, and the \"Liber\" praises the new king.\n\nAn important part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier \"Vita\", or \"Life\", of Æthelthryth, which resembles the \"Vitae\" of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely. The work may have helped to increase the number of pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King Æthelred II (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift. The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the \"Liber\" would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation. The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the \"Liber\".\n\nAnother concern of the chronicle was the acquisition of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The \"Liber\" was used by the monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.\n\nA third theme of the work is the stress on the importance and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The \"Liber\" stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.\n\nThe \"Liber\" was familiar to the 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris, who used it along with the \"Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis\" of Ramsey Abbey in his own historical works. Another 13th-century English writer, Roger of Wendover, was also aware of the \"Liber\".\n\nSome of the information contained in the \"Liber\" is important to historians. It is in the \"Liber\" that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the \"Benedictine Rule\" into Old English is made. The \"Liber\" is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal chancery, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The \"Liber\" describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear. The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest is a matter of some debate amongst historians.\n\nThe historian Dorothy Whitelock says of the work that it is \"unique among post-Conquest monastic histories\". It was written to help buttress the claims of Ely to a judicial liberty, or the exercise of all the royal rights within a hundred. To do this, the \"Liber\" collected together earlier sources used to help the abbey evade episcopal control, prior to the abbey becoming a bishopric. These documents may have been forged or had their contents doctored to help the abbey's cause. Because of the tendentious nature of the collection, the work is used by historians with great caution. Despite the untrustworthy nature of the \"Liber\" and the documents preserved therein, it remains a valuable source for the history of the time period it covers, as well as the internal history of the abbey and bishopric. The historian Antonia Gransden characterises the \"Liber\" as \"valuable for general history\", but qualifies by saying that \"the whole lacks unity and has errors and confusing repetitions\".\n\nThe work survives in two complete manuscripts (MS), that of Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.1, usually known as the E manuscript; and one in the possession of Ely Cathedral Chapter, usually known as the F manuscript. The E manuscript dates from the late 12th century, and shows three different scribal hands. The F manuscript dates to the early 13th century, with four scribal hands. The E manuscript was given to Trinity College as part of the Gale Collection by Roger Gale in 1738. The F manuscript has remained at Ely since its creation, and is the only manuscript at Ely still remaining from the medieval monastic library.\n\nAs well as the two complete manuscripts, a number of other manuscripts contain parts of the whole work. British Library MS Cotton Titus A.i, usually known as the G manuscript, has part of Book II, and dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. British Library MS Cotton Domitian A.xv, known as the B manuscript, dates from the late 13th or early 14th century and includes some other material along with Book I and the same parts of Book II as in manuscript G. Another Cottonian manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Vespasian A.xix, has parts of Book III, and dates to between 1257 and 1286. This manuscript is usually known as the A manuscript.\n\nThe relationship between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts relate to each other cannot be made. Blake, in his edition of the \"Liber\", suggests that Book I once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or an earlier version of that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.\n\nRelated manuscripts include Bodleian Library Oxford MS Laud 647, known as the O manuscript. This is based on the \"Liber\", but reorganised into a listing of the acts of the various abbots and bishops and dates from the 14th century. Blake, in his edition of the \"Liber\", calls that and related works the \"Chronicon Abbatum et Episcoporum Eliensium\". Another related work is contained in Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.41, which contains the \"Libellus\" of Æthelwold and an Ely cartulary. Two other related works containing just cartularies are British Library Cotton MS Tiberius A vi and Cambridge University Library Ely Diocesan Register Liber M.\n\n\"Liber Eliensis\" has been published by the Royal Historical Society in its Camden Third Series, edited by E. O. Blake. The edition contains the Latin text along with some Old English texts, but no translation. Janet Fairweather has produced a recent English translation of the Latin, published in 2005 by the Boydell Press.\n\nFormerly, only sections of the \"Liber\" had appeared in print, without translations. Parts of the \"Liber\" were edited by D. J. Stewart and published by the Anglia Christiana Society in 1848. Other extracts were published in various works, including parts of Book I that were included in Volume 2 of Jean Mabillon's nine-volume \"Acta Sanctorum\", printed between 1688 and 1701. Another set of extracts, mainly consisting of parts of Book II, was compiled by Roger Gale's father Thomas Gale, as part of his \"Historicae Britannicae Scriptores XV\", published at Oxford in 1691.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5644591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5644591", "title": "Miguel Asín Palacios", "text": "Miguel Asín Palacios\n\nMiguel Asín Palacios (1871–1944) was a Spanish scholar of Islamic studies and the Arabic language, and a Roman Catholic priest. He is primarily known for suggesting Muslim sources for ideas and motifs present in Dante's Divine Comedy, which he discusses in his book \"La Escatología musulmana en la Divina Comedia\" (1919). He wrote on medieval Islam, extensively on al-Ghazali (Latin: Algazel). A major book \"El Islam cristianizado\" (1931) presents a study of Sufism through the works of Muhyiddin ibn 'Arabi (Sp: Mohidín Abenarabe) of Murcia in Andalusia (medieval Al-Andalus). Asín also published other comparative articles regarding certain Islamic influences on Christianity and on mysticism in Spain.\n\nMiguel Asín Palacios was born in Zaragoza, Aragón, on July 5, 1871, into the modest commercial family of Don Pablo Asín and Doña Filomena Palacios. His older brother Luis, his younger sister Dolores, and he were little children when their father died of pneumonia. His mother the young widow continued in business with help and made ends meet with decorum but not as well as before. He attended the Colegio de El Salvador instructed by Jesuits in Zaragoza, where he began to make lifelong friendships. He entered the Seminario Conciliar, singing his first Mass at San Cayetano in Zaragoza in 1895.\n\nAt the Universidad de Zaragoza Asín had met and begun study under the Arabist Professor Julián Ribera y Tarragó. In 1896 at Madrid he defended his thesis on the Persian theologian Ghazali (1058–1111) before and Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo. All three professors guided his subsequent studies. Asín then developed his study of Al-Ghazali, and published it in 1901. He also wrote on Mohidin Abenarabe, who is often called the leading figure in Islamic mysticism. Thus Asín was running parallel with a then European-wide effort to understand Muslim inner spirituality.\n\nProfessor Codera then retired from his chair in the Arabic Language at the Universidad de Madrid in order to create room there for Asín; Ribera in Zaragoza allowed Asín to leave to assume this Madrid \"cátedra\" in 1903. Professor Asín lived in the same well-connected boarding house as Codera, and was well received in the university. By 1905 Professor Ribera had also come to Madrid; together with Asín they soon founded the journal \"Cultura Española\" (1906–1909). Asín attended international conferences in Algeria (1905) and Copenhagen (1908), where he engaged other Arabists and academics in Islamic studies. In Madrid he continued to prosper, eventually being admitted to the royal court where he gained the friendship of Alfonso XIII.\n\nAsín, of course, is known for his academic work concerning the medieval Muslim-Christian interface of theology, mysticism, and religious practice, with a focus on Spain. His was a form of intellectual history. Among the figures studied were Al-Ghazali, Ibn 'Arabi, Averroës (Ibn Rushd), Ibn Masarra, and Ibn Hazm, as well as the rabbi Maimonides (all from Al-Andalus except al-Ghazali). Asín did comparative work vis-à-vis Islam respecting Ramon Lull, Thomas Aquinas, Dante Alighieri, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, and Blaise Pascal.\n\nAsín's manner of approach was to stick to a theme, to keep circling over it, each time adding to the understanding. His method of work involved meticulous planning, by first conceiving the order of presentation in detail, then straight ahead, without a rough draft (\"sin borrador\"), redacted with each reference note on its proper page.\n\nIn 1932 the journal \"Al-Andalus\" began publication under the direction of Asín Palacios; it was technically equipped to satisfy a readership of academic specialists. Asín himself was a frequent contributor. In the universities, a new generation of Spanish Arabists was emerging, such as Emilio García Gómez, influenced by Asín. In 1936 Asín was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War began in July 1936, and caught Asín Palacios while in San Sebastián in the Basque country visiting his nephew and family. The horrors of this struggle remain very painful to contemplate with regard to both sides; over four thousand priests were assassinated by extremist factions on the loyalist side early in the conflict. Asín was in personal danger, yet that September nationalist forces captured San Sebastián. During the war he taught Latin and managed to obtain photocopies of Arabic texts. After the trauma of Civil War, Asín was able to return to Madrid and resume his professorship at the university. There he continued his duties and his work on his multi-volume study of Al-Ghazali.\n\nDon Miguel Asín Palacios had intense black eyes, fine hands; photographs did not seem to capture his personality or expressions. He was well dressed (\"entre cardenal y torero\"). Not ambitious but for the tranquility in which to work, he was a good and generous friend. His colleagues recognized in him an enduring innocence, so that he was \"not knowing\" in the mixed turbulence of the world. He projected a brightness (\"diafanidad\"); his mind had developed to become a great work of refinement. A pious priest, an admirer of John Henry Newman, \"a child of 73 years\" when he died.\n\nHe died on August 12, 1944, in San Sebastián. His passing prompted many scholars to review his work.\n\nFollowing early publications on Al-Ghazali and Ibn 'Arabi as noted above, Asín Palacios discussed, edited and rendered into Spanish translation many Arabic writings, and composed books and essays on related themes, including an occasional piece in Latin, French, or Italian.\n\nAsín Palacios researched Muslim influence on Tomás d'Aquino (c. 1225-1274), which would most likely come from the philosopher Ibn Rushd of Córdoba (1126–1198), whether as protagonist or antagonist. Ibn Rushd came to be written \"Averroës\" in Latin. The result was the 1904 article, \"El Averroísmo teológico de Santo Tomás de Aquino\" by Asín, the professor from Zaragoza newly arrived in Madrid.\n\nWith respect to Greek philosophy, particularly Aristotle, Asín infers that the religio-philosophic world inhabited by Averroës is analogous to that of Aquinas, and also to that of ben Maimon or Maimonides (1135–1204) the Jewish philosopher and talmudist, also from Córdoba. Asín understood that it was with piety that Averroës used reason to interpret his Islamic faith, and probes this issue for the sake of clearly distinguishing Averroës from several of the not-so-pious Latin \"Averroístas\". Asín also refers to medieval voluntarism (called \"asaries\" in Islam), in order to contrast and distinguish the similar rationalisms held by Averroës and by Aquinas. Yet, many Thomists did not then accept without great controversy Asín's point of view.\n\nIn his 1914 book, \"Abenmasarra y su escuela. Orígenes de la filosofía hispano-musulmana\", Asín opens by describing the evolution of Islamic philosophy and cosmology at the center of Islamic civilization in the East, in comparison with its later emergence in Al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia). A brief biography of Ibn Masarra (883-931) follows. There Asín posits the continuation of pre-existing Iberian culture among Hispanic natives who, following its conquest, converted to Islam. Because of Abenmasarra's father's client status (to his Berber mawla), Asín infers that he was such a Muslim 'Spaniard' (a muladi). Asín describes his affinity to Greek philosophy, i.e., neoplatonism, then notes the accusations of heresy against him, and that he early concealed his teachings. At that time the Muslim ruler faced severe political unrest, being challenged by armed rebels such as 'Umar ibn Hafsun; accordingly the Emir showed little tolerance for religious dissenters like Abenmasarra. Ibn Masarra felt compelled to flee, traveling to Qairawan and Mecca. Yet eventually he managed to return to Córdoba under the next Emir, and to set up his School which contained sufi elements.\n\nActually Asín's work is less about Ibn Masarra of Córdoba (due to a then lack of surviving sources), than about his \"school\" of early Muslim mystics in al-Andalus. With reference to their teachings and its context, Asín discusses the batini, the mutazili, the shi'a, and the sufis of Islam, as well as the Greco-Roman mystic Plotinus (205-270), and especially the pseudo-Empedocles. Mentioned several times by Asín is a perspective he favored: eastern Christianity's early influence on the young religion before Islam's arrival in the west. Asín infers that Ibn Masarra's school influenced Ibn al-Arif (1088–1141) of Almería. This Ibn al-'Arif became the focus of an emerging Sufi circle later called the \"muridin\". His followers spread out over al-Andalus, but they became too strong in the opinion of the governing power; they were variously suppressed by the Almoravids who then ruled al-Andalus from Marrakech. Asín then discusses the influence of the school on Jewish figures of al-Andalus, for example, Judah ha-Levi (c. 1085-c. 1140), and in particular on Solomon ibn Gabirol (c. 1021-1058), known in Latin as \"Avicebron\". Ibn Gabirol wrote in Arabic the book \"Fons Vitae\" which still survives. It apparently shows clear neo-Platonic references to the school of Ibn Masarra.\n\nAsín points to the impact of these Muslim and Jewish thinkers of Spain regarding medieval Christian theology, for example, the long drawn-out struggle between the Aristotilean ideas of Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) and those of Duns Scotus (1266–1308). Asín's dogged research, on the persistent influence of Ibn Masarra's school of mystical philosophy, leads him to follow its tracks eventually to Ibn 'Arabi (1165–1240), as well as to Ramon Lull (1233–1315) and to Roger Bacon (c. 1214-c. 1294). Later another scholar would find evidence that may link the school of Ibn Masarra to the philosopher of light [\"al-Ishraq\"] and mystic of Iran, Suhrawardi (c. 1155-1191). Asín's 1914 \"Abenmasarra y su escuela\" established a lasting influence on subsequent scholarship.\n\nPerhaps Asín Palacios is best remembered for his 1919 book, \"La Escatologia Musulmana en la Divina Comedia\", which sparked lively and extended discussions among Dante scholars. Asíin here suggests Islamic sources for the theological landscapes used by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) in his work \"La Divina Commedia\", written c.1308 to 1320. Specifically, Asín compares the Muslim religious literature surrounding the night journey [al-'Isra wal-Mi'rag] of Muhammad (from Mecca to Jerusalem and thence up with the prophets through the seven heavens), with Dante's story describing his spiritual journey in which he meets various inhabitants of the afterlife and records their fate.\n\nAccordingly, Asín (I) discusses in detail the above night journey in Muslim literature, (II) compares it to episodes in the inferno, the purgatorio, and the paradiso of \"La Divina Commedia\", (III) investigates Muslim influence on corresponding Christian literature predating the poem, and (IV) conjectures how Dante could have known directly of the Muslim literature in translation.\n\nPrior to Asín's \"La Escatologia\" it was assumed that Dante drew from the long poem the \"Aeneid\" by the ancient Roman poet Virgil for the inspiration to create the memorable scenes of the afterlife. In his \"Divina Comedia\", Dante himself plays the leading role; he is guided by the deceased poet Virgil as they travel through the \"Inferno\" and the \"Purgatorio\". Asín remarks that the addition of the Muslim sources in no way detracts from Dante's achievement, and that Dante remains a luminous figure and his poem retains its exalted place in world literature.\n\nAsín's book inspired a wide and energetic reaction, both positive and negative, as well as further research and academic exchanges. Eventually two scholars, an Italian and a Spaniard, independently uncovered an until-then buried Arabic source, the 11th-century \"Kitab al-Mi'raj\" [Book of the Ladder (or of the ascent)], which describes Muhammad's night journey. This work was translated into Spanish as \"La Escala de Mahoma\" [The Ladder of Muhammad] by a scribe (Abrahim Alfaquim) of the Spanish king Alfonso X el Sabio in 1264.\n\nInformation also surfaced about another translation of it into Latin, \"Liber Scalae Machometi\", which has been traced to the Italian milieu of the poet, Dante Alighieri. Evidently Dante's mentor Brunetto Latini met the Latin translator of the \"Kitab al-Mi'raj\" while both were staying at the court of king Alfonso X el Sabio in Castilla. Although this missing link was not available to Asín, he had based his work on several similar accounts of Muhammad's ladder then circulating among the literary or pious Muslims of Al-Andalus.\n\nThe importance of Ibn Hazm of Córdoba (994-1064) to the Muslim culture of Spain was earlier recognized by Asín. He had outlined Ibn Hazm's influence on medieval Islam, and had published a study with translation which addressed his ethical thought, followed by a volume concerning Ibn Hazm's views on religious history. During his career, Ibn Hazm became a remarkable figure, not least for the wide scope of his abilities, e.g., producing significant writings as a theologian, as a jurist, and as a poet.\n\nFrom 1927 to 1932, Asín published a 5-volume study, \"Abenházam de Córdoba y su historia crítica de las ideas religiosas\" [Ibn Hazm of Cordoba and his \"Critical History of Religious Ideas\"]. Asín's first volume presents a biography, including his life as a jurist/politician and his trail through the world of intellect; Asín here gives a critique of the writings of the medieval Spanish Muslim, focusing on Ibn Hazm as a theologian and as an early historian of religions. The remaining four volumes comprise an incomplete yet lengthy translation of Ibn Hazm's \"Fisal\", a very long work on the history of religious ideas, its Arabic title being \"Kitab al-Fisal fi al-milal wa-al-ahwa' wa-al-nihal\" [Book of Separation. Concerning Religions, Heresies, and Sects].\n\nIbn Hazm's \"Fisal\" has six parts: 1. non-Muslim religions (in Asín's volumes II-III), 2. Muslim sects (Asín's III-IV), 3. Muslim faith and theology (IV), 4. several constitutional questions regarding Islamic government (V), 5. Muslim heresies (V), 6. theology in 29 questions (V). In part 1 of the \"Fisal\", Ibn Hazm gives a polemical description of Christian scriptures and trinitarian doctrine, its putative errors and contradictions, showing familiarity with the texts. He also comments on Judaism, Zarathustra, Brahmans, sophists, atheists, and polytheists. According to Asín, many subsequent anti-Christian polemics by Muslims more or less followed part I of Ibn Hazm's \"Fisal\". Asín, in his \"Disertación preliminar\" to the \"Fisal\", compares the late emergence of comparative religious history in Christian Europe with its relative early start in Islam, noting the geographical proximity of Islam to a variety of differing religions. For example, an early Islamic work that discusses Buddhism appeared in the 9th century. Yet Asín more than once refers to Ibn Hazm as the first historian of religions.\n\nAsín Palacio's biography shows Ibn Hazm as once vizier to the declining Umayyad caliphs before retiring to his study. During the course of his career Ibn Hazm had become a Muslim jurist of the \"Zahiri\" (or \"literalist\") school of law. His legal treatise on fiqh, \"Ibtal\", is referenced by Asín and regards the Zahiri rejection of the heuristic use of analogy, learned opinion, social equity, juristic authority, and 'spirit' of the law, as unacceptable legal method. Late in his \"Fisal\", as a jurist Ibn Hazm addresses possible rebellion against an unjust Imam; the distinction is made between not obeying an unjust order and taking action to overthrow an unjust ruler. Ibn Hazm enters another controversy, opining that women may be given inspiration by God, referring to the \"mujer de Abraham\" (i.e., Sarah) and to the \"madre de Jesús\" María (like Mahoma visited by the \"ángel Gabriel\"). After publication of Asín's 5-volume study, additional writings of Ibn Hazm were discovered in the library of the Fatih Mosque in Istanbul, including legal \"responsa\", to which Asin devoted an article.\n\nAnother work by Asín, which became well-known to scholars of Islam, addresses the life and the sufi philosophy of Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi (1165–1240) of the Iberian city of Murcia. Asín Palacios had already written a number of studies and translations of Ibn 'Arabi, the revered (and controversial) mystic, but his major work was \"El Islam cristianizado. Estudio del sufismo a través de las obras de Abenarabi de Murcia\" (Madrid 1931). Following an introduction that proposes that Sufism emerged from the influence of Christian monasticism on Islam, the book presents three parts: first, a short life of Ibn 'Arabi [31-118]; second, commentaries that approach the complexity of his voluminous writings, his mystical teachings, his place in sufism, and his subsequent influence [119-274]; third, selections translated from seven of Ibn 'Arabi's works, including the Meccan \"Fotuhat\" [275-518].\n\nAsín's brief biography describes Ibn 'Arabi's youthful 'conversion' to an inward path and first teachers, his adolescent meeting with Averroës, three of his visionary encounters with the 'maestro de verde' [green master] Jádir, and his travels visiting various sufis in al-Maghreb (e.g., Fes, and Túnez). In 1201 Ibn 'Arabi traveled further east across North Africa in pursuit of his spiritual journey, to Meca, Bagdad, Mosul, Cairo, Conia, Medina, Jerusalén, Alepo, and Damasco, where he died and where his tomb now draws pilgrims.\n\nIbn 'Arabi was prolific teacher, leaving us a vast corpus of written works. Asín functioned as a western pioneer in Sufi studies, particularly with respect to the difficult and demanding Ibn 'Arabi, the \"Shaykh al-Akbar\". Not surprisingly Asín assumes the viewpoint of a spiritually involved Christian academic; he sees in the works of Ibn 'Arabi many similarities with his own religion's mystics and doctrines. Consequently, Asín brings his specific, spiritually-informed consciousness to his discussion of the principles and practices taught by Ibn 'Arabi. According to Prof. Alexander Knysh, Asín was one of the earlier western scholars of Ibn 'Arabi, a motivated European clergyman who was:\n\n\"concerned with detecting the underlying affinities between Christian and Islamic theology with a view to advancing an Islamo-Christian dialogue. Such Christian scholars treated Ibn 'Arabi, if not exactly as a crypto-Christian, then at least as a freethinker open to other religious confessions, especially Christianity. However, a scrutiny of Ibn 'Arabi's attitude toward other confessions, reveals little direct indebtedness to, or sympathy for, Christian doctrines.\"\n\nAsín Palacios begins his second part by discussing the Sufi spiritual journey, its methods and discipline, and its various supporting societies. Here, Asín describes the distinct approaches found or developed by Ibn 'Arabi. For example, Asín mentions the purgative preparation required by Ibn 'Arabi regarding the \"four deaths\", i.e., \"white\", death to hunger; \"red\", dying to passion; \"black\", to endure suffering; \"green\", to enter poverty. While some see adjacent virtues clearly when young, and others take first a hard path of trials and of sorrows... eventually to meet a challenging paradox and become humbled in the wilderness; yet each soul may mercifully receive a spiritual transformation, to become ultimately possessed by divine love in a felicitous vision of unity. Ibn 'Arabi has described several varieties of sacred experience, including one in which, having known \"an awareness of unity with the Divine\", a soul may return to the former daily life, yet nonetheless remaining aware also of the fruit of mystical events, conscious both of the \"I and the not I\", the commonplace and the transcendent. Here Asín apparently \"avoided any analysis of Ibn 'Arabi's metaphysics.\"\n\nIn his introduction, Asín observes that while Christian Spain later became deeply influenced by Muslim mysticism, previously the oriental Church had equally influenced early Islam. Islam then arrived in the far west, the Maghreb al-Aksa and Andalusia, where Ibn 'Arabi would be born. From the perspective of religious studies, it might be said that Asín Palacios here presents us with a multidimensional, polyphonic text for comparative religion. In his other works on Sufi practice, Asín mentions precursors of Ibn 'Arabi in al-Andalus (i.e., the school of \"Ibn Masarra\"), as well as those who drew on his teachings afterwards (for example, the tariqah of the \"Sadilies\" [or \"xadilíes\"]). Asín refers to the many parallels between al-Ghazali and Ibn 'Arabi, both well-known and still studied teachers.\n\nAmong the many articles of Asín Palacios are studies concerning the following subjects:\n\n\n\nAlthough Asín carefully followed the leads he found, nonetheless he continually seemed to remain grounded to his core area of research: the mutual influence of the distinctive civilizations of Islam and of Christianity during the centuries of Muslim rule in Spain, and thereafter, and the multilateral implications. Here is the transliteration of Asín's name to reflect its Arabic pronunciation: Asīn Balāthīus.\n\nIn the 1930s, Asín began yet another study of Al-Ghazali (1058–1111), which is entitled, \"La espiritualidad de Algazal y su sentido cristiano.\" Asín expressly declared that the work was limited to a Christian interpretation of the celebrated Muslim and his work. His investigation focuses on themes of spiritual practice from the forty volume \"magnum opus\" of al-Ghazali, the \"Ihya 'Ulum ad-Din\" [\"Revival of the Religious Sciences\"].\n\nBritish scholar A. J. Arberry in 1942 called Asín's multivolume study \"by far the most important monograph on Ghazali so far written,\" but adversely noted the importation of foreign religious sentiments into Asín's work on the Muslim theologian. Yet Asín, noting the multiple interpenetration of the two rival faiths, felt justified in his course.\n\nAfter addressing Al-Ghazali the person, including a short biography, Asín analyses the teachings of his \"Ihya\" in four parts: \n\nIn Asín's concluding volume IV, he translates selections from works by Al-Ghazali (21 titles other than the \"Ihya\") and provides a brief analysis of each.\n\nIn 1933 Asín published in the first issue of the journal \"Al-Andalus\" an article about San Juan de la Cruz (1542–1591) and a doctrine he shared with spiritual Islam. This work can be seen to be equally about the saint's suggested forerunner, a Muslim mystic from Ronda, Ibn Abbad al-Rundi (1332–1389); and also about Ibn Abbad's own sources in the Sadili school (tariqah).\n\nThe shared doctrine concerns the soul on the path toward union with the Divine. God, being unreachably transcendent, the soul's only approach is to renounce everything but God. Thereby the soul enters a desolation in which he (or she) lives only for God, yet the desolation may become too severe, causing the soul to despair, so that the merciful Deity grants him (or her) inspiration, followed by a phase of elation; afterwards the soul returns to the way through desolation in order to move closer to God. The doctrine shared teaches that the soul passing through these alternating states of \"night\" (contraction, due to despair) and \"day\" (inspired expansion) may relinquish the \"charismata\" of God's inspiring favors, i.e., the \"day\", so as to pass more quickly beyond the difficult rhythm of \"night\" and \"day\". Thereafter the soul finds repose, wherein to enter the transforming union. Asín analyses the technical vocabulary used by the sadilis and by San Juan de la Cruz in order to further establish the connection.\n\nWhile not disputing these similarities as discussed by Asín, a subsequent scholar, José Nieto, remained critical of any implied linkage between the earlier teachings of the Sadili sufis and San Juan de la Cruz. To the contrary, the suggestion is that this 'shared mystical doctrine' functions at such a level of generality that it will arise spontaneously.\n\nIn a posthumously published article, Asín discusses Santa Teresa de Ávila (1515–1582). The similes and analogies she employed to communicate the experiences of her spiritual life are discovered by Asín to parallel those previously employed by mystics of Islam. In this instance the image used is of seven dwelling places or castles, one inside the other. Asín mentions the \"Tanwir\" of the sadili Ibn 'Ata Allah; the \"Tayrid\" of Ahmad al-Gazali (brother of Algazel); and, the anonymous \"Nawadir\" compiled by Ahmad al-Qalyubi, with its seven concentric castles. Asín draws out other mutualities in the matrix of symbols, for example, the Divinity being in the central dwelling.\n\nLuce López-Baralt further explores this association of images, tracing the parallel to a 9th-century Islamic mystic of Baghdad, Abu-l-Hasan al-Nuri (died 907), whose \"Maqamat al-qulub\" [\"Stations of the Heart\"] describes seven castles, one inside the other, through which the soul travels toward God. After quoting a passage in which Sta. Teresa describes her spontaneous acquaintance with the castle image, López-Baralt infers that Sta. Teresa's acquisition of the Islamic parallel was indirect, probably from a popular allusion that lay dormant within her for years, resurfacing later to help her communicate her mystical experiences. Following other similar studies, Catherine Swietlicki took a new but related direction, discussing Saint Teresa's Jewish heritage, and her mysticism as filtered through the mutual presence of three faiths. The Catholic writings of Santa Teresa de Ávila, widely recognized and revered, may accordingly be understood to reflect as well a generality of shared values among the Judaic, Christian, and Islamic faiths during those blessed periods of \"convivencia\" in medieval Spain.\n\nThe works of Asín Palacios are widely admired, notwithstanding criticism that his view point was of a Christian priest while involved in the neutral academic field of Islamic studies. In his own country, the labors of the Spanish Arabists, to which he contributed greatly, has over the generations worked to favorably alter the view shared by many Spaniards concerning the Muslim period of their history. His spiritual insights into Islamic mysticism illuminated formerly obscure figures and hidden connections. Perhaps, too, along with Louis Massignon and others, it can be said that the Professor Rev. Miguel Asín Palacios was instrumental in the open recognition by the Catholic Church of Islam as a legacy of Abraham, articulated in the \"Nostra aetate\" document of Vatican II (1962–1965).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Instituto Miguel Asín Palacios\" continues to publish the journal \"Al-Qantara. Revista de Estudios Árabes\", in conjunction with the \"Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas\" (CSIC). Volume one of \"Al-Qantara\" [The Arch] was issued in 1980 at Madrid. This journal is a continuation of the journal \"Al-Andalus\" (1933–1978) which began under the direction of Professor Asín.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32726135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32726135", "title": "Secundative language", "text": "Secundative language\n\nA secundative language is a language in which the recipients of ditransitive verbs (which takes a subject and two objects: a theme and a recipient) are treated like the patients (targets) of monotransitive verbs (verbs that take only one object), and the themes get distinct marking. Secundative languages contrast with \"indirective languages\", where the recipient is treated in a special way.\n\nWhile English is mostly not a secundative language, there are some examples. The sentence \"John gave Mary the ball\" uses this construction, where the ball is the theme and Mary is the recipient.\n\nThis language type was called dechticaetiative in an article by Edward L. Blansitt, Jr. (from Greek \"dekhomai\" \"take, receive\" and an obscure second element, unlikely \"kaitoi\" \"and indeed\"), but that term did not catch on. They have also been called anti-ergative languages and primary object languages.\n\nDitransitive verbs have two arguments other than the subject: a theme that undergoes the action and a recipient that receives the theme (see thematic relation). In a secundative language, the recipient of a ditransitive verb is treated in the same way as the single object of a monotransitive verb, and this syntactic category is called primary object, which is equivalent to the indirect object in English. The theme of a ditransitive verb is treated separately and called secondary object, which is equivalent to the direct object.\n\nEnglish is not a true secundative language, as neither the theme nor recipient is primary, or either can be primary depending on context.\n\nA true secundative construction is found in West Greenlandic, the direct object of a monotransitive verb appears in the absolutive case:\n\nIn a ditransitive sentence, the recipient appears in absolutive case and the theme is marked with the instrumental case:\n\nSimilarly, in Lahu, both the patient of a monotransitive verb and the recipient of a ditransitive verb are marked with the postposition \"thàʔ\":\n\nIn secundative languages with passive constructions, passivation promotes the primary object to subject. For example, in Swahili:\n\nthe recipient \"Fatuma\" is promoted to subject and not the theme \"zawadi\" 'gift'.\n\nMany languages show mixed indirective/secundative behavior. English, which is primarily indirective, arguably contains secundative constructions, traditionally referred to as dative shift. For example, the passive of the sentence\n\nis\n\nin which the recipient rather than the theme is promoted to subject. This is complicated by the fact that some dialects of English may promote either the recipient (\"Mary\") or the theme (\"the ball\") argument to subject status, and for these dialects '\n\n(meaning that the ball was given to Mary) is also well-formed. In addition, the argument structure of verbs like \"provide\" is essentially secundative: in\n\nthe recipient argument is treated like a monotransitive direct object.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20799473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20799473", "title": "The Newcastle Programme", "text": "The Newcastle Programme\n\nThe Newcastle Programme was a statement of policies passed by the representatives of the English and Welsh Liberal Associations meeting at the annual conference of the National Liberal Federation (NLF) in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1891. The centrepiece of the Newcastle Programme was the primacy of Irish Home Rule, but associated with it were a raft of other reforms, in particular: land reform; reform of the Lords; shorter parliaments; district and parish councils; registration reform and abolition of plural voting; local veto on drink sales; employers' liability for workers' accidents and Scottish and Welsh disestablishment.\n\nThe Newcastle Programme was therefore important for two reasons; first, it gave the Liberal party a Radical agenda on which to fight the next general election and second, the detailed 'shopping list' of policies it adopted was innovatory in British politics, setting a precedent for modern political parties. Today ordinary members of all major political parties participate in policy development and the parties present the electorate with a programme or manifesto for government, agreed or endorsed in some way by their members.\n\nThe Liberal Party's leading pioneer of organised campaigning had been Joseph Chamberlain. In 1885, he put forward the Radical Programme, unauthorised by the party leadership, as an election manifesto for using the constructive power of the state but Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone subverted Chamberlain's efforts, co-opting the NLF for mainstream Liberalism. By adopting Home Rule for Ireland as his banner, Gladstone trumped the Radical Programme, driving Chamberlain out of the party to form the Liberal Unionists. In the great schism of 1886 over Home Rule, the NLF deserted Chamberlain to remain loyal to Gladstone.\n\nBetween 1886 and 1891, Home Rule dominated Liberal policy debates but two events damaged their Irish allies. In 1887, \"The Times\" published letters, implicating Charles Stewart Parnell, the Irish Home Rule party leader, in the Phoenix Park murders of a government minister and a civil servant, although a high-profile government inquiry later discovered the letters to be forgeries. In 1890, the divorce of Katharine O'Shea, which identified Parnell as Mrs O'Shea's lover, split the Irish party and scandalised nonconformist Liberals. The split in the Irish Home Rule party in 1890 weakened the likelihood of a successful Home Rule Bill. At the 1891 meeting of the NLF in Newcastle upon Tyne Gladstone reaffirmed the primacy of Home Rule, but associated it with reforms on the mainland by adopting various proposals of the NLF Council, in particular: land reform; reform of the Lords; shorter parliaments; district and parish councils; registration reform and abolition of plural voting; local veto on drink sales; employers' liability for workers' accidents; Scottish and Welsh disestablishment. The Newcastle programme was to be the solution to these dilemmas, a manifesto for British government. \n\nEach year the National Liberal Federation met for debate in what may be seen as the forerunner of today's political party conferences. The NLF developed a process by which it passed an omnibus resolution incorporating all the policies that had been agreed in debate. In the autumn of 1891, the Federation met in Newcastle upon Tyne. In addition to Home Rule, the policies, which were crowded onto the omnibus, may be divided into three main areas: rural, religious and electoral reform. On 2 October 1891, Gladstone spoke to the NLF and for the first time, a Liberal Party leader had lent support to a programme proposed by the party's grass roots.\n\nHowever, one historian has argued that the Radicals inside the Liberal Party lacked the leadership to ensure their programme was truly implemented. Michael Bentley suggests that while Gladstone and the Liberal leadership was obliged to listen to the opinion of such a significant section of the party, they were able to slide along without making firm commitments and to pick and choose from the 'rag-bag' of policies that made up the Newcastle Programme, prioritising those they wanted and forgetting those they disliked.\n\nOne of Gladstone's biographers also supports this assessment. Roy Jenkins asserts that Gladstone's only real interest now lay in Irish Home Rule, but he allowed John Morley and William Vernon Harcourt to cobble together the Newcastle Programme which he describes as 'a capacious ragbag... weak on theme'. According to Jenkins, Gladstone had neither the time nor energy to oppose the NLF programme and decided to swallow it whole just to ensure the party remained wedded to Home Rule as its principal policy.\n\nGladstone's endorsement of the Newcastle Programme had one important outcome. A few weeks later, on 25 November, Lord Hartington, the leader of the Liberal Unionist Party, announced that there was no longer any hope of re-union with the Gladstonian Liberals.\n\nThe Liberal Party won the 1892 election, but its majority relied on Irish Nationalist support, and the results were far from the sort of endorsement from the electorate that Gladstone hoped. The new government was unable to enact much of the Newcastle Programme, even those parts that Gladstone approved, because of implacable opposition from the Conservative-dominated House of Lords.\n\nAccording to one historian of the Liberal Party, the Conservative leader Lord Salisbury justified their rejection of the Liberal measures including, crucially, Home Rule, on the basis that the Liberal victory in 1892 had rested on the votes of 150 electors in eight constituencies collected by offering many different policy bribes. Of the Newcastle Programme, the government's principal achievements were employers' liability, parish councils and William Vernon Harcourt's 1894 budget, which introduced graduated death duties.\n\nGladstone resigned as prime minister in 1894 and was replaced with Lord Rosebery who poured scorn on the Newcastle Programme as the 'flyblown phylacteries of obsolete policies'.
