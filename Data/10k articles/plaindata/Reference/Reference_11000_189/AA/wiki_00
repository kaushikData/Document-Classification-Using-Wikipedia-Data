{"id": "51898759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51898759", "title": "ABC Chinese–English Dictionary", "text": "ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\n\nThe ABC Chinese–English Dictionary or ABC Dictionary (1996), compiled under the chief editorship of John DeFrancis, is the first Chinese dictionary to collate entries in single-sort alphabetical order of pinyin romanization, and a landmark in the history of Chinese lexicography. It was also the first publication in the University of Hawai'i Press's \"ABC\" (Alphabetically Based Computerized) series of Chinese dictionaries. They republished the \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\" in a pocket edition (1999) and desktop reference edition (2000), as well as the expanded \"ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary\" (2003) and dual \"ABC Chinese–English/English-Chinese Dictionary\" (2010). Furthermore, the \"ABC Dictionary\" databases have been developed into computer applications such as Wenlin Software for learning Chinese (1997).\n\nJohn DeFrancis (1911–2009) was an influential American sinologist, author of Chinese language textbooks, lexicographer of Chinese dictionaries, and Professor Emeritus of Chinese Studies at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa. After he retired from teaching in 1976, DeFrancis was a prolific author of influential works such as \"\" (1984) and \"Visible Speech: The Diverse Oneness of Writing Systems\" (1989).\n\nVictor H. Mair, a sinologist and professor of Chinese at the University of Pennsylvania, first proposed the idea of a computerized pinyin Chinese–English dictionary in his 1986 lexicographical review article \"The Need for an Alphabetically Arranged General Usage Dictionary of Mandarin Chinese.\" He defined \"alphabetically arranged dictionary\" to mean a dictionary in which all words (\"cí\" 詞) are \"interfiled strictly according to pronunciation. This may be referred to as a \"single sort/tier/layer alphabetical\" order or series.\" He emphatically does not mean a usual Chinese dictionary collated according to the initial single graphs (\"zì\" 字) that are only the beginning syllables of whole words. \"With the latter type of arrangement, more than one sort is required to locate a given term. The head character must first be found and then a separate sort is required for the next character, and so on.\" (1986: 2). Mair's article had two purposes, to call the attention of his colleagues to the critical need for an alphabetically arranged Chinese dictionary and to enlist their help in making it a reality, and to suggest that \"all\" new sinological reference tools should at least include alphabetically ordered indices. \"Someone who already knows the pronunciation of a given expression but not its meaning should not be cruelly burdened by having to fuss with radicals, corners, strokes, and what not. Let him go directly to the object of his search instead of having to make endless, insufferable detours in an impenetrable forest of graphs.\" (1986: 20).\n\nIn DeFrancis' Acknowledgements, he says \"This dictionary owes its genesis to the initiative of Victor H. Mair\", who after unsuccessful attempts to obtain financial support for the compilation of an alphabetically based Chinese–English dictionary, in 1990 organized an international group of scholars who volunteered to contribute towards compiling it. However, \"agonizingly slow progress\" made it apparent that a fulltime editor was necessary, and in May 1992 John DeFrancis offered to undertake the project centered at the University of Hawai'i (1996: ix).\n\nAlong with Prof. DeFrancis overseeing the general planning and supervision of the project as well as its detailed operations, a volunteer team of some 50 contributors – including academics, Chinese language teachers, students, lexicographers, and computer consultants – were involved in the myriad tasks of processing dictionary entries, such as defining, inputting, checking, and proofreading. The University of Hawai'i Press published the \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\" in September 1996. UHP republished the original paperback \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\", which had a total 916 pages and was 23 cm. high, into the \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary: Pocket Edition\" (1999, 16 cm.) and hardback \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary: Desk Reference Edition\" (2000, 23 cm.).\n\nIn Shanghai, DeFrancis' dictionary was published under the title \"Han-Ying Cidian: ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\" (Hanyu Dacidian Chubanshe, 1997). For reasons of political correctness, the Shanghai edition amended the entry for Lin Biao (Sawer 2001: 225). It altered the original American edition's \"veteran Communist military leader and Mao Zedong's designated successor until mysterious death\" to \"veteran Communist military leader; ringleader of counterrevolutionary group (during Cultural Revolution)\".\n\nVictor H. Mair became general editor of the ABC Chinese Dictionary Series in 1996, and the University of Hawai'i Press has issued ten publications (as of October 2016), including two developments from the \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\" (1996) with 71,486 head entries. John DeFrancis and others edited the hardback \"ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary\" (2003, 1464 pp., 25 cm.), which contains over 196,501 head entries, making it the most comprehensive one-volume dictionary of Chinese. DeFrancis (posthumously) and Zhang Yanyin, professor of Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics at the University of Canberra, edited the bidirectional paperback \"ABC Chinese–English/English-Chinese Dictionary\" (2010, 1240 pp., 19 cm.). It contains 67,633 entries: 29,670 in the English-Chinese section, 37,963 in the Chinese–English section, which is an abridgment of the \"ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary\" and includes improvements such as more usage example sentences.\n\nComputers (namely, the \"C\" in \"ABC Dictionary\") were purposefully involved in almost every stage of dictionary compilation and publication in order to facilitate further advances in electronic lexicography and software development. In 1997, the Wenlin Institute published \"Wenlin Software for Learning Chinese\" with about 14,000 head entries (version 1.0) and entered into a licensing agreement with the University of Hawaii to utilize the \"ABC Dictionary\" database in Wenlin software. The first edition \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\" (1996) was incorporated into Wenlin 2.0 with over 74,000 entries (1998); the second \"ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary\" (2003) went into Wenlin 3.0 with over 196,000 entries (2002); and the third edition \"ABC English-Chinese/Chinese–English Dictionary\" (2010) was incorporated into Wenlin 4.0 (2011), which includes 300,000 Chinese–English entries, 73,000 Chinese character entries, and 62,000 English-Chinese entries.\n\nPrior to the alphabetically arranged \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\", virtually every Chinese dictionary was based upon character head entries, arranged either by character shape or pronunciation, that subsume words and phrases written with that head character as the first syllable. While pronunciation determines the placement of words within the unconventional \"ABC Dictionary\", Chinese characters still determine the position of words within a standard dictionary. Comparing a Chinese character-based dictionary with the pinyin-based \"ABC Dictionary\" illustrates the difference. \"The Chinese–English Dictionary\" (Wu 1979: 431) locates the head character entry \"lín\" 林 \"① forest; woods; grove ② circles …\" as one of 14 characters pronounced \"lín\", and alphabetically lists 17 words with \"lín\" as the first syllable, for instance, \"línchǎnpǐn\" 林产品 \"forest products\", \"línhǎi\" 林海 \"immense forest\", and \"línyè\" 林業 \"forestry\". The \"ABC Dictionary\" includes \"lín\" 林 \"① forest; woods; grove ② forestry…\" as one of 6 characters pronounced \"lín\", followed by alphabetically listed \"lin\"-initial headwords from \"línbā\" 淋巴 \"lymph\" to \"línfēng\" 臨風 \"facing against the wind\", but then \"ling\"-initial words begin to appear with \"líng\" 〇 \"zero\", and only after another three pages will one find \"lìngzūn\" 令尊 \"(courteous) your father\" followed by \"línhǎi\" \"immense forest\" (McGinnis 1997: 568). DeFrancis' \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\" is aptly described as having \"defied the tyranny of Chinese characters\" (Clark 2001: 387).\n\nThe \"ABC Dictionary\" includes 5,425 different Chinese characters and a total 71,486 lexical entries. The dictionary's most notable feature is being entirely arranged by pinyin in the alphabetical order of complete compound words. For example, \"kuàngquán\" 矿泉 \"mineral spring\" immediately precedes \"kuángquǎnbìng\" 狂犬病 \"rabies\", which in turn immediately precedes \"kuàngquánshuǐ\" 矿泉水 \"mineral water\", even though the first and last words begin with the same character and the middle word with another (Sawer 2001: 224).\n\nThe present dictionary has several titles: \n\nThe \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\" comprises three main sections: an 18-page front matter, the 833-page body matter of alphabetically arranged entries, and 64-page back matter with nine appendices.\n\nThe front matter includes a Table of contents; Dedication to \"China's Staunchest Advocates of Writing Reform\"; Editor's Call to Action; Acknowledgments; Introduction with I. Distinctive Features of the Dictionary and II. Selection and Definition of Entries; and User's Guide with I. Arrangement of Entries, II. Orthography, III. Explanatory Notes and Examples, IV. Works Consulted, and V. Abbreviations (1996: i–xix).\n\nThe dictionary proper gives alphabetically arranged lexical entries and English translation equivalents, from \"a* 啊 ' [i.e., particle] \"used as phrase suffix\" ① (\"in enumeration\") … ② (\"in direct address and exclamation\") … ③ (\"indicating obviousness/impatience\" … ④ (\"for confirmation\")\" to \"zúzūn 族尊 ' clan seniors\" (1996: 1 and 833, usage examples omitted).\n\nThe \"ABC Dictionary\" has nine Appendices: I. Basic Rules for Hanyu Pinyin Orthography [promulgated by the State Language Commission in 1988]; II. Historical Chronology [from the Shang Dynasty c. 1700–1045 BC to the Republic of China \"1912–1949\" and People's Republic of China 1949–]; III. Analytic Summary of Transcription Systems [for Pinyin, Wade-Giles, Gwoyeu Romatzyh, Yale Romanization, and Zhuyin Fuhao]; IV. Wade-Giles/Pinyin Comparative Table; V. PY/WG/GR/YR/ZF Comparative Table; VI. Radical Index of Traditional Characters, Notes on Kangxi Radicals, Kangxi Radical Chart, Kangxi Radical Index; VII. Stroke Order List of Recurrent Partials; VIII. Stroke Order Index of Characters with Obscure Radicals; IX. Radical Index of Simplified Characters, with Notes on Selected CASS Radicals [viz. the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences system of 189 radicals used in dictionaries like the \"Xinhua Zidian\"], High Frequency CASS Radicals, Simplified/Traditional Radical Conversion Table, CASS Radical Chart, CASS Radical Index [for users who want to look up a Chinese logograph's pronunciation, listing the 5,425 characters appearing in the dictionary] (1996: 835–897).\n\nDeFrancis' \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\" claims six lexicographical distinctions.\n\nThe main source for \"ABC Dictionary\" entries is the 1989 edition of \"Hanyu Pinyin Cihui\" 汉語拼音詞汇 \"Hanyu Pinyin Romanized Lexicon\", a semi-official wordlist of 60,400 entries (without definitions) compiled by members of the PRC State Language Commission. Focusing upon the needs of Western students of Chinese, DeFrancis and the editors eliminated some terms and added others. Their dictionary includes many neologisms such as \"dàgēdà\" 大哥大 \"cellular phone\" or \"dǎo(r)yé\" 倒爷 \"profiteer; speculator\", as well as the modern Chinese practice of incorporating the Latin alphabet in coining Sino-alphabetic words like \"BP-jī\" BP机 \"pager; beeper\".\n\nIn contrast to most Chinese–English dictionaries, DeFrancis' emphasizes multisyllabic \"cí\" \"words\" rather than monosyllabic \"zì\" \"characters\". It only includes monosyllabic character entries that are likely to be encountered as free forms or unbound morphemes (according to the \"Xiandai Hanyu Pinlü Cidian\" 现代汉语频率词典 \"Frequency Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese\").\n\nChinese word frequency is an important aspect of the \"ABC Dictionary\", and it lists homophones according to their decreasing occurrence. Frequency orders are based largely on \"Xiandai Hanyu Pinlü Cidian\" for monosyllabic entries and \"Zhongwen Shumianyu Pinlü Cidian\" 中文书面语频率词典 \"Dictionary of the Chinese Written Language\" for polysyllabic words (1996: xiii). For entries with identical spelling, including tones, arrangement is by order of frequency, indicated by a superscript number before the transcription, a device adapted from Western lexicographic practice to distinguish homonyms. For example, \"dàomù 盜墓 ' rob graves\" and \"dàomù 道木 ' railway sleeper [tie]\". For entries that are homographic if tones are disregarded, the item of highest usage frequency is indicated by an asterisk following the transcription (see \"a\"* 啊 above), for instance, \"lìguǐ 厉鬼 ' ferocious ghost\" and \"lìguì* 立柜 ' clothes-closet; wardrobe; hanging cupboard\". While frequency information is useful for students learning vocabulary, the \"ABC Dictionary\" chiefly provides it in order to help determine the default items in computer usage. \"Our unique combination of letters, tone marks, and raised numbers provides a simple and distinctive one-to-one correspondence between transcription and character(s) that is intended to facilitate computerized handling of the entries.\" (1996: xiv).\n\nThe \"ABC Dictionary\" format for entries is (1996: xiii):\n\nTake the \"dao\" in Daoism for an example dictionary entry.\ndào 道 ① road ② channel ③ way ④ doctrine ⑤ Daoism ⑥ line ♦ ' \"for rivers/topics/etc.\" ♦ ' ① say; speak; talk chángyán dào as the saying goes Tā shuō ~: \"...\" He said: \"...\" ② think; suppose (1996: 113) \nThis concise entry uses a superscript on \"dào\" to denote 道 as the second most commonly occurring unbound character pronounced \"dào\", gives six English translation equivalents, distinguishes syntactic uses as a measure word and a verb, and gives two characterless usage examples \"chángyán dào\" 常言道 and \"Tā shuōdào\" 他說道.\n\nReviews of DeFrancis' \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\" were published by major academic journals in linguistics (e.g., \"The Modern Language Journal\"), Asian studies (\"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society\"), and sinology (\"China Review International\"). Most reviewers criticized certain aspects, such as the difficulty of looking up a traditional Chinese character, but also highly evaluated the innovative dictionary.\n\nHere are three representative examples of praise: \"the most extraordinary Chinese–English dictionary I have ever had such pleasure to look Chinese words up in and to read their English definitions\" (Bauer 1997: 307); \"The thorough scholarship and fresh outlook make it a valuable contribution to Chinese lexicography, while the high production standards and comprehensive coverage of the colloquial language should make it a favourite of all serious students of Modem Chinese\" (Jensen 1998: 144); \"This excellent one-volume Chinese–English dictionary is a crowning achievement for John DeFrancis, one of the doyens of Chinese language teaching in the United States\" (Sawer 2001: 224).\n\nA common area of complaint involves the \"ABC Dictionary\"'s treatment of traditional and simplified Chinese characters. Dictionary entries give simplified characters for headwords, and only give the traditional form upon the first appearance of each character, and in the appendices. For instance, critics say, \"looking up characters in traditional form is a bit more trouble than it might be, you must use a special index\" (Chung 1998: 660); and the dictionary is \"clearly not designed to be used by anyone who does serious work with nonsimplified characters\" (Jensen 1998: 144).\n\nOne reviewer panned the \"ABC Dictionary\"'s supplementary materials. For instance, saying the front matter's \"uncommonly profuse\" dedication and Editor's Call to Action reveal \"no doubt that axes are being ground\" about writing reform; the Distinctive Features of the Dictionary \"reads like an abstract for a research grant application\"; and describing most of the appendices as \"a hodgepodge of pub quiz trivia\" (Jensen 1998: 143).\n\nSeveral evaluations of the \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\" mention cases in which using the alphabetically-arranged headword entries is more efficient than using a conventionally arranged dictionary with character head entries that list words written with that character as the first. Robert S. Bauer, a linguist of Cantonese at Hong Kong Polytechnic University says the dictionary works best when users hear a word pronounced but do not know how to write it in characters, they can very quickly look it up in pinyin order and find the correct characters and meanings. However, to look up an unknown character's pronunciation and meaning, then one needs to use a radical-indexed dictionary. Bauer says \"I have generally succeeded in finding almost all the words and expressions I have tried to look up; this I regard as quite remarkable since I cannot say the same about other dictionaries I have been consulting over my more than 25 years of working on Chinese.\" (1997: 308). Sean Jensen says alphabetical collation is \"truly iconoclastic\" in the tradition-rich world of Chinese lexicography and describes experimenting with using the dictionary.\nI am used to the \"old style\" dictionaries based on radicals, and I was disposed to approach the \"ABC Dictionary\" with some skepticism. But having used it for two months I have so(sic) say that it is nothing short of wonderful! It is a pleasure to be able to use a Chinese dictionary in the same way that one uses a French or German dictionary. The typography is exceptionally clear, and the sheer quantity of words per page, arranged alphabetically, has the effect of bringing the melodies of spoken Chinese alive. (1998: 144) \nMichael Sawer, professor of Chinese at the University of Canberra, says using the \"ABC Dictionary\" does not make it easy to quickly find all the words beginning with the same Chinese character; but it does enable readers to easily find all those pronounced the same (disregarding tonal differences), as well as which among homophonous words is used most frequently (2001: 224).\n\nTaking a contrary view, Karen Steffen Chung, professor of Chinese at National Taiwan University, found using DeFrancis' dictionary less satisfying than traditional dictionaries, where all compounds beginning with the same character are listed together under that character head entry. Giving the circular example of a hypothetical dictionary user wanting to find all the compounds beginning with \"shí\" 實 \"to realize\", which is certainly easier with a customary Chinese dictionary than with the \"ABC\", Chung says that the alphabetic arrangement is unfortunately \"its biggest drawback\", and while \"this may reflect an ideal of treating Chinese primarily as a spoken rather than written language, it also goes against native habit and intuition.\" (1998: 660).\n\nScott McGinnis, professor of Chinese at the University of Maryland, explains that users of the \"ABC Dictionary\" who are already familiar with written Chinese and dictionaries organized by character headings must \"forget\" what they know about the Mandarin syllabic inventory and focus strictly on the spelling. For some dictionary users, purely pinyin-dependent sequencing such as \"cuānzi\" 镩子 \"ice pick\" to \"cūbào\" 粗暴 \"rude; rough; crude\" and \"nǎngshí\" 曩时 \"(written) in olden days; of yore\" to \"nánguā\" 南瓜 \"pumpkin\" \"may be at least initially confusing\" (1997: 568).\n\nJan W. Walls, professor of Chinese language and culture at Simon Fraser University, describes some minor oversights in the dictionary such as the \"dīshì 的士 taxi\" entry, which might imply the borrowing came directly from English, when it actually is a loanword from Cantonese \"dik si\" 的士 transcribing \"taxi\". But this is a minor point, \"merely \"meizhong-buzu\" 美中不足 (defined in \"ABC\" as \"blemish in sth. otherwise perfect\") that should not detract from the great value of this important work … which is quite likely to become a standard reference work for English-speaking students of Mandarin, and to remain so for quite some time.\" (1998: 113–114).\n\nThe expanded 2003 \"ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary\" had fewer academic reviews than the 1996 \"ABC Chinese–English Dictionary\".\n\nMichael Sawer, who also reviewed the original \"ABC Dictionary\", calls this comprehensive dictionary an \"outstanding contribution to the field, in many ways better than other comparable dictionaries\" (2004: 313). He makes comparisons between the \"ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary\" (called \"\"ABC\") and two bilingual dictionaries aimed more at native speakers of Chinese who are learning English: the \"Han-Ying Da Cidian\" (Wu 1993, \"CED\" Chinese–English Dictionary) and \"Xiandai Hanyu Cidian: Han-Ying Shuangyu\" (CASSIL 2002, \"CCD\"\" Contemporary Chinese Dictionary).\n\nThe 2003 \"ABC\", like the 1996 first edition, is arranged in strict single-sort alphabetical order, while both the \"CED\" and \"CCD\" are in double-sort alphabetic order—that is, the first syllables of each word are arranged in alphabetic order, and then within each tone category in order of different characters. Take for instance, dictionary users wanting to look up \"yìshi\" 意识 \"consciousness; mentality\". A user who knows the pronunciation begins with \"yì\" can search (in ascending number of strokes) through some eighty characters pronounced \"yì\" before finding 意, and then 意识; or a user who knows that \"yìshi\" is written 意识 can find 意 in the radical index, under the \"heart radical\" 心, then the 9 remaining strokes in 音, and find the page number for the 意 head entry (Sawer 2004: 310). A great advantage of \"ABC\" is that you can immediately look up a word you have heard but whose exact tone, meaning, and characters are unknown to you. For \"yishi\" in all tonal combinations, this dictionary gives 46 different words, with 意识 easily found. What an \"ABC\" user cannot straightforwardly see (which of course they can in the other two dictionaries) is all the words listed beginning with \"yì\" 意.\n\n\"ABC\" gives grammatical information with around 30 tags, including both parts of speech (\"V.\" for verb) and other tags (\"ID.\" for idiom). \"CED\" provides just 11 grammatical tags, while \"CCD\" only marks numerals and classifiers. The comprehensive grammatical tags in \"ABC\" are \"a most valuable feature\", especially for learners of Chinese, and many words have more than one grammatical function (e.g., \" xuéxí\" 学习 [學習] ' study; learn; emulate ◆ ' learning\"). Another useful \"ABC\" grammatical tag is B.F. for \"bound form\" (as opposed to free form words, mentioned above), but this distinction is not usually indicated in PRC dictionaries such as \"CED\" and \"CCD\" (Sawer 2004: 311).\n\nProper nouns receive a particularly ample treatment in \"ABC\" (especially compared with \"CED\" and \"CCD\"). These include people's names (e.g., some 15 beginning with the surname Lǐ 李, ranging from the famous poet Li Bai to the former PRC President Li Xiannian), names of automobiles (like \"Xiàlì\" 夏利 \"Charade\"), and many toponyms (\"Xiàwēiyí\" 夏威夷 \"Hawaii\", spelled with the ʻokina) (Sawer 2004: 312).\n\nYanfang Tang, professor of Chinese at the College of William and Mary, says the \"ABC Chinese–English Comprehensive Dictionary\" \"stands above its peers as one of the most comprehensive, informative, and useful tools in the study of and dealing with the Chinese language\" (2005: 145). This dictionary is a valuable asset for several types of users. Native speakers will particularly benefit from the \"authentic and accurate English translations\" of Chinese words and phrases, which are an improvement over sometimes \"stiff and awkward\" translations in previous Chinese–English dictionaries, which were edited predominantly by Anglophone native speakers of Chinese. Chinese–English translators, students of Chinese as a foreign language, and compilers of Chinese language textbooks will find this dictionary indispensable for providing comprehensive linguistic information. Nonnative speakers of Chinese will find the dictionary handy to use, and those who are accustomed to alphabets will find locating a Chinese word in this alphabetically arranged dictionary \"almost an act of second nature\". Advanced learners of Chinese who have a firm command of pinyin will also benefit, especially in cases when they know how to pronounce a word but do not remember how to write it, and will be able to quickly find the character (2005: 145).\n\nTang suggests an improvement for future \"ABC Dictionary\" editions. Users who want to look up an unfamiliar character may find the layout of Stroke-Order Index and Radical Index to be \"awkward, inconvenient, and time-consuming\" because after looking the character up, the index gives the pinyin pronunciation instead of the page (2005: 146).\n\n\n"}

It was based on the original British publication, \"The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris\", with which it merged to form \"The Astronomical Almanac\", published from the year 1981 to the present.\n\nAuthorized by Congress in 1849, the American Nautical Almanac Office was founded and attached to the Department of the Navy with Charles Henry Davis as the first superintendent. The \"American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac\" was first published in 1852, containing data for the year 1855. Its data was originally calculated by human \"computers\", such as Chauncey Wright and Joseph Winlock. Between 1855 and 1881 it had two parts, the first for the meridian of Greenwich contained data on the Sun, Moon, lunar distances, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, which was published separately as \"The American Nautical Almanac\". The second part contained data for the meridian of Washington on the Sun, Moon, planets, principal stars, eclipses, occultations, and other phenomena. Beginning in 1882, data for Mercury, Uranus, and Neptune was added to the first part, with eclipses, occultations, and other phenomena forming a separate third part. In 1916, \"The American Nautical Almanac\" ceased to be a reprint of the first part of the \"American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac\", becoming a separately prepared volume for the navigator. In 1937, the \"American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac\" was divided into seven parts, with data for the meridian of Washington substantially reduced, then eliminated beginning in 1951. Data for Pluto was added in 1950.\n\nBeginning in 1960, all parts except for a few introductory pages were jointly calculated and typeset by the American Nautical Almanac Office and Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office but published separately within \"The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac\" and \"The Astronomical Ephemeris\", a new name for the old British title \"The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris\". Beginning in 1981, the title \"The American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac\" and the British title \"The Astronomical Ephemeris\" were completely merged under the single title \"The Astronomical Almanac\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "575230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=575230", "title": "Blackbirding", "text": "Blackbirding\n\nBlackbirding involves the coercion of people through trickery and kidnapping to work as labourers. Generally, persons of European ancestry, or others being paid by them, coerced persons of indigenous ancestry as labourers throughout the Southeast Pacific region through this system. Blackbirders sought laborers for several major industries or plantations.\n\nFrom the 1860s, blackbirding ships in the Pacific sought workers to mine the guano deposits on the Chincha Islands in Peru. In the 1870s the blackbirding trade focused on supplying labourers to Southeast Asian plantations, particularly those for sugar-cane in Queensland and Fiji. The first documented practice of a major blackbirding industry for sugar-cane labourers occurred between 1842 and 1904. Indigenous persons of nearby Pacific islands or northern Queensland were recruited or coerced by blackbirding colonial Europeans. In the early days of the pearling industry in Western Australia at Nickol Bay and Broome, local Aborigines were blackbirded from the surrounding areas.\n\nBlackbirding has continued to the present day in developing countries. One example is the kidnapping and coercion at gunpoint of indigenous people in Central America to work as plantation labourers in the region. They are exposed to heavy pesticide loads and do hard labour for very little pay.\n\nThe term may have been formed directly as a contraction of \"blackbird catching\"; \"blackbird\" was a slang term for the local indigenous people.\n\nFor several months between 1862–63, crew on Peruvian ships (and a few Chilean ships under the Peruvian flag) combed the smaller islands of Polynesia, from Easter Island in the eastern Pacific to the Ellice Islands (now Tuvalu) and the southern atolls of the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati), seeking workers to fill an extreme labour shortage in Peru.\n\nIn 1862 J. C. Byrne, an Irish speculator, persuaded countrymen to financially back a scheme to bring \"colonists\" from the New Hebrides to Peru as indentured agricultural workers. The first ship, \"Adelante\", was fitted and on 15 June 1862 set out across the Pacific. Calling in at Tongareva (Penrhyn) in the northern Cook Islands, Byrne found the one island in the Pacific where the population was willing to leave because of a severe coconut famine. He took 253 recruits; by September, they were working in Peru as plantation field laborers and domestic household servants.\n\nAlmost immediately other speculators and ship owners fitted out ageing ships that traveled to Polynesia to transport \"willing colonists\". From September 1862 to April 1863, no less than 30 ships set out. As profit was the main motive, many ship captains resorted to dishonest tactics and kidnapping to fill their ships.\n\nIn June 1863 about 350 people were living on 'Ata atoll in Tonga, in a village called Kolomaile. Its remains were visible a century later. Captain Thomas James McGrath of the Tasmanian whaler \"Grecian\", having decided that the new slave trade was more profitable than whaling, went to the atoll and invited the islanders on board for trading. However, once almost half of the population was on board, he ordered the ship's doors and rooms locked, and the ship sailed away. 144 persons would never return. The \"Grecian\" also tried to take slaves from the Lau group, but was unsuccessful. McGrath captured only 30 people from Niuafouou; this was the second island in Tonga to be affected. (Uiha was the third island he approached, but there the islanders reversed roles and ambushed the ship \"Margarita\".)\n\nThe \"Grecian\" never reached Peru. Probably near Pukapuka (Cook Islands), McGrath met another slaver, the \"General Prim\", which had left Callao in March. Its captain was willing to take over the 174 Tongans to quickly return to port, where it arrived on 19 July. Meanwhile, the Peruvian government, under pressure from foreign powers and shocked that its labour plan had turned into a slave trade, had on 28 April 1863 cancelled all licenses. The islanders on board \"General Prim\", and other ships were not allowed to land. They were transferred to other ships chartered by the Peruvian government to return them to their homeland.\n\nBy the time the \"Adelante\" (on which the Tongans were put) finally left on 2 October 1863, many of the Tongans had already died or were dying from contagious diseases. Captain Escurra of the \"Adelante\" (formerly a successful slaver), pocketed his fee of $30/head, but dumped the Tongans on uninhabited Cocos Island. He later claimed that the 426 kanakas were affected with smallpox and a danger to his crew. When the whaler \"Active\" visited the island on 21 October, its crew found some 200 Tongans still alive. A month later the Peruvian warship \"Tumbes\" went to rescue the remaining 38 survivors and took them to Paita, where they were apparently absorbed into the local population.\n\nThe Rev. A. W. Murray, the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu, described the practices of blackbirders in the Ellice Islands. He said they promised islanders that they would be taught about God while working in coconut oil production, but the slavers' intended destination was the Chincha Islands in Peru. Rev. Murray reported that in 1863, about 180 people were taken from Funafuti and about 200 were taken from Nukulaelae, leaving fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.\n\nBully Hayes, an American ship-captain who achieved notoriety for his activities in the Pacific from the 1850s to the 1870s, is described as arriving in Papeete, Tahiti in December 1868 on his ship \"Rona\" with 150 men from Niue. Hayes offered them for sale as contract or indentured labourers.\n\nThe expansion of plantations in Fiji and in Samoa, as well as sugar plantations in Australia, also created market destinations for blackbirders. Ships also called at the islands of Melanesia and Micronesia, taking off their workers for other places. In 1871 the first Anglican Bishop of Melanesia, John Patteson, was killed on Nukapu island (one of the Solomon Islands) by indigenous people five days after blackbirders had killed one man and abducted five others there.\n\nSo many ships entered the blackbirding trade (with adverse effects on islanders) that the British Navy sent ships from Australia Station into the Pacific to suppress the trade. (By 1808 both Great Britain and the United States had prohibited the African slave trade.) However, the ships of the Australian Squadron (\"HMS Basilisk\", \"HMS Beagle\", \"HMS Conflict\", \"HMS Renard\", \"HMS Sandfly\" and \"HMS Rosario\") did not succeed in suppressing the blackbirding trade.\n\nFrom the 1860s, the demand for labour in Queensland, Australia, resulted in blackbirding in the region. Queensland was a self-governing British colony in northeastern Australia until 1901, when it became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia. Over a period of 40 years, from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, traders \"recruited\" Kanaka labourers for the sugar cane fields of Queensland, from the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu), Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and the Loyalty Islands of New Caledonia as well as Niue. The Queensland government tried to regulate the trade: it required every ship engaged in recruiting labourers from the Pacific islands to carry a person approved by the government to ensure that labourers were willingly recruited and not kidnapped. Although, such government observers were often corrupted by bonuses paid for labourers 'recruited,' or blinded by alcohol, and did little or nothing to prevent sea-captains from tricking islanders on-board or otherwise engaging in kidnapping with violence. Joe Melvin, an investigative journalist who, undercover, in 1892 joined the crew of Queensland blackbirding ship \"Helena\", found no instances of intimidation or misrepresentation and concluded that the Islanders recruited did so \"willingly and cannily\".\n\nThe generally coercive recruitment was similar to the press-gangs once employed by the Royal Navy in England. Some 55,000 to 62,500 Kanakas were brought to Australia.\n\nThese people were referred to as Kanakas (the French equivalent \"Canaques\" is still used to refer to the ethnic Melanesians in New Caledonia) and came from the Western Pacific islands: from Melanesia, mainly the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides, with a small number from the Polynesian and Micronesian islands such as Tonga (mainly 'Ata), Kiribati, Tuvalu, and Loyalty Islands. Many of the workers were effectively slaves, but they were officially called \"indentured labourers\" or the like. Some Australian Aboriginal people, especially from Cape York Peninsula, were also kidnapped and transported south to work on the farms.\n\nThe methods of blackbirding were varied. Some labourers were willing to be taken to Australia to work, while others were tricked or forced. In some cases blackbirding ships (which made huge profits) would entice entire villages by luring them on board for trade or a religious service, and then setting sail. Many died during the voyage due to unsanitary conditions, and in the fields due to the hard manual labour.\n\nThe question of how many Islanders were kidnapped or \"blackbirded\" is unknown and remains controversial. Official documents and accounts from the period often conflict with the oral tradition passed down by the descendants of workers. Stories of blatantly violent kidnapping tended to relate to the first 10–15 years of the trade.\n\nThe majority of the 10,000 Pacific Islanders remaining in Australia in 1901 were compulsorily repatriated from 1906–08 under the \"Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901\". Those who were married to an Australian were exempt from compulsory repatriation. Today, the descendants of those who remained are officially referred to as South Sea Islanders. A 1992 census of South Sea Islanders reported around 10,000 descendants living in Queensland. Fewer than 3,500 were reported in the 2001 Australian census.\n\nThe blackbirding era began in Fiji in 1865 when the first New Hebridean and Solomon Island labourers were transported there to work on cotton plantations. The American Civil War had cut off the supply of cotton to the international market when the Union blockaded southern ports. Cotton cultivation was potentially an extremely profitable business. Thousands of European planters flocked to Fiji to establish plantations but found the natives unwilling to adapt to their plans. They sought labour from the Melanesian islands. On 5 July 1865 Ben Pease received the first licence to provide 40 labourers from the New Hebrides to Fiji.\n\nThe British and Queensland governments tried to regulate this recruiting and transport of labour. Melanesian labourers were to be recruited for a term of three years, paid three pounds per year, issued with basic clothing and given access to the company store for supplies. Most Melanesians were recruited by deceit, usually being enticed aboard ships with gifts, and then locked up. The living and working conditions for them in Fiji were worse than those suffered by the later Indian indentured labourers. In 1875, the chief medical officer in Fiji, Sir William MacGregor, listed a mortality rate of 540 out of every 1000 labourers. After the expiry of the three-year contract, the government required captains to transport the labourers back to their villages, but most ship captains dropped them off at the first island they sighted off the Fiji waters. The British sent warships to enforce the law (Pacific Islanders' Protection Act of 1872) but only a small proportion of the culprits were prosecuted.\n\nA notorious incident of the blackbirding trade was the 1871 voyage of the brig \"Carl\", organised by Dr James Patrick Murray, to recruit labourers to work in the plantations of Fiji. Murray had his men reverse their collars and carry black books, so to appear to be church missionaries. When islanders were enticed to a religious service, Murray and his men would produce guns and force the islanders onto boats. During the voyage Murray shot about 60 islanders. He was never brought to trial for his actions, as he was given immunity in return for giving evidence against his crew members. The captain of the \"Carl\", Joseph Armstrong, was later sentenced to death.\n\nBeginning in 1879, British planters arranged for the transport of Indian indentured labourers in Fiji. The number of Melanesian labourers declined, but they were still being recruited and employed in such places as sugar mills and ports, until the start of the First World War. In addition, as recounted by writer Jack London, the British and Queensland ships often used black crews, sometimes recruited among the islanders. Most of the Melanesians recruited were males. After the recruitment ended, those who chose to stay in Fiji took Fijian wives and settled in areas around Suva. Their multi-cultural descendants identify as a distinct community but, to outsiders, their language and culture cannot be distinguished from native Fijians.\n\nDescendants of Solomon Islanders have filed land claims to assert their right to traditional settlements in Fiji: a group living at Tamavua-i-Wai in Fiji received a High Court verdict in their favour on 1 February 2007. The court refused a claim by the Seventh-day Adventist Church to force the islanders to vacate the land on which they had been living for seventy years.\n\nIslanders fought back and sometimes were able to resist those engaged in blackbirding. Historic events in Melanesia are being assessed in the context of blackbirding, and with the addition of new material from indigenous oral histories and interpreting to acknowledge indigenous agency. The practice of blackbirding attracted significant public attention in Great Britain after native people killed Anglican missionary John Coleridge Patteson, Bishop of Melanesia, in September 1871 on Nukapu in what is now Temotu Province, Solomon Islands. His death from the beginning was interpreted as resistance by local people to kidnapping and forced labor. Patteson is considered a martyr by the Anglican Church. A few days before his death, one of the local men had been killed by blackbirders and five others were abducted.\n\nHowever, a 2010 article argues for a larger role of women in the event and a different precipitating event. When Patteson tried to persuade islanders to release their children to him to be educated in a distant Christian mission school, Niuvai, wife of the paramount chief, and other women did not want to lose their children to him. Niuvai persuaded the men to kill the bishop. An alternative theory is that Patteson had disrupted the local hierarchy, and especially threatened the patriarchal order.\n\nAt the time, Patteson's death caused outrage in England and contributed to the government's cracking down to try to control the abusive aspects of blackbirding. Great Britain annexed Fiji as a way to suppress such slavery.\n\nAmerican author Jack London recounted in his memoir, \"The Cruise of the Snark\" (1907), an incident at Langa Langa Lagoon Malaita, Solomon Islands, when the local islanders attacked a \"recruiting\" ship:\n\n... still bore the tomahawk marks where the Malaitans at Langa Langa several months before broke in for the trove of rifles and ammunition locked therein, after bloodily slaughtering Jansen's predecessor, Captain Mackenzie. The burning of the vessel was somehow prevented by the black crew, but this was so unprecedented that the owner feared some complicity between them and the attacking party. However, it could not be proved, and we sailed with the majority of this same crew. The present skipper smilingly warned us that the same tribe still required two more heads from the Minota, to square up for deaths on the Ysabel plantation. (p 387)\nIn another passage from the same book, he wrote:\n\nThree fruitless days were spent at Su'u. The Minota got no recruits from the bush and the bushmen got no heads from the Minota. (p 270)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32004104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32004104", "title": "Breakdowns (comics)", "text": "Breakdowns (comics)\n\nBreakdowns is a collected volume of underground comic strips by American cartoonist Art Spiegelman. The book is made up of strips dating to before Spiegelman started planning his graphic novel \"Maus\", but includes the strip \"Maus\" which presaged the graphic novel, and \"Prisoner on the Hell Planet\" which is reproduced in \"Maus\". The original edition of 1977 is subtitled \"From Maus to Now\"; the expanded 2008 edition is subtitled \"Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&*!\".\n\nThe original 1977 edition was made up of short, experimental strips, some of which were autobiographical, made between 1972 and 1977. At that stage in his career, Spiegelman was more interested in the formal elements of the comics medium than in its content or storytelling aspects. He experimented with and explored the relation of panels to each other on the page, pictorial manipulation, and how far one could take a story formally before it became incoherent. He parodied and paid homage to his cartoon heroes, notably Chester Gould's \"Dick Tracy\", \"Rex Morgan, M.D.\", and Winsor McCay's \"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend\".\n\nThe cover depicts Spiegelman drinking a bottle of India ink over repeated variants of the same image. The title is written in shaky block letters, implying both visual and psychological breakdowns.\n\nThe expanded 2008 edition made use of a swirl or squiggle motif. The seemingly tossed-off squiggle is used in a variety of contexts. It is first introduced as the expression of surprise of the character on the cover slipping on a copy of the first edition of \"Breakdowns\" (rather than a clichéd banana peel). At other times it is used to represent the artist himself, or the squiggles he makes as a youth learning to draw.\n\nSpiegelman depicts himself in the vest that has become synonymous with his image since \"Maus\", in contrast to his appearance in the comics from the original \"Breakdowns\".\n\n\"Breakdowns\" was originally published in an edition that sold less than 3000 copies in 1977 by Belier Press as \"Breakdowns: From Maus to Now\", collecting strips that had appeared between 1972 and 1977 in various underground publications, including \"Arcade\", which Spiegelman had co-edited. Unusually for American comics at the time, it was published in hardcover.\n\nIt was republished by in an expanded edition Pantheon Books in 2008 and retitled \"Breakdowns: Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&*!\", with a new introductory comic and long afterward from which nearly doubles the length of the original book. When Spiegelman had been working on \"In the Shadow of No Towers\", a book with many of the formal concerns of \"Breakdowns\", his editor at Pantheon Books, Dan Frank, approached him to reprint \"Breakdowns\".\n\nSpiegelman visually relates the story of a boy who bullied him and spat on his mother in his youth, echoing with irony the well-known Charles Atlas advertisements such as \"The Insult that Made a Man out of Mac\" that ran in comic books. He fills the dialog balloons with text from Viktor Shklovsky's essay \"Art as Technique\".\n\nThe volume failed to capture a wide audience. Spiegelman says this indifference was the impetus to take on \"Maus\".\n\n\n"}

Later it moved to Singapore, Colombo (Ceylon), Kilindini (Kenya), then returned to Colombo.\n\nThe FECB was located in an office block in the Naval dockyard, with an armed guard at the door (which negated any attempt at secrecy). The intercept site was on Stonecutters Island, four miles across the harbour, and manned by a dozen RAF and RN ratings (plus later four Army signallers). The codebreaking or Y section had Japanese, Chinese and Russian interpreters, under RN Paymaster Arthur (Harry) Shaw, with Dick Thatcher and Neil Barnham. The FECB was headed by the Chief of Intelligence Staff (COIS) Captain John Waller, later by Captain F. J. Wylie.\n\nShaw had been dealing direct with GC&CS and the C-in-C Far East in Shanghai, but found that Waller expected that everything should go through him, and paid little regard to keeping sources secret. So by 1936 the two most senior naval officers were barely on speaking terms. Colonel Valentine Burkhart found when he arrived in 1936 that the bureau was involved in “turf wars”, although they eventually accepted that they had no control over the use of intelligence reports.\n\nInitially the Y section was to focus on the three main Japanese Navy codes and cyphers; the Japanese Naval General Cypher, the Flag Officer code and the \"tasogare\" or basic naval reporting code used to report the sailings of individual ships. In 1938 a section was set up to attack Japanese commercial systems and so to track supply convoys. From 1936 many messages were sent back to London, to be deciphered by John Tiltman, who broke the first version of JN-25 in 1939.\n\nIn August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of war with Germany, the FECB moved to Singapore on HMS \"Birmingham\" for fear of Japanese attack. A skeleton staff of a codebreaker (Alf Bennett) and four intercept operators were left at Hong Kong, and they were captured by the Japanese on Christmas Day 1941.\n\nFECB went to Seletar Naval Base, and the intercept station to Kranji. An RAF \"Y\" interception unit, 52 Wireless Unit, arrived in Singapore in early November 1941. As Bletchley Park was concentrating on German Enigma cyphers, many of the Japanese naval section in Hut 7 moved to FECB, Singapore. By May 1940 there were forty people working solely on JN-25, who could read simple messages. The new codebook JN-25B was introduced on 1 December 1940, but was broken immediately as the additives were not changed.\n\nThere was interchange with Station CAST at Corregidor, which was better placed to intercept IJN messages, as FECB could only receive the Combined Fleet in home waters at night. FECB also collaborated with the US Army Station 6 intercept site at Fort McKinley near Manila. FECB was sent one of the American Purple machines from Bletchley Park in a warship. Supposed to be sent only by warship or military transport, it was trans-shipped at Durban to the freighter \"Sussex\". The ship’s Master said he landed it at the Naval Store Singapore at the end of December 1941, but the Naval Stores Officer denied any knowledge of it; hopefully it was destroyed or dumped in the sea. But the Hollerith tabulating machine (minus a key part, which had to borrowed from the Indian State Railways in Bombay) arrived safely in Colombo.\n\nFECB also cooperated with Kamer 14 (Room 14), the Dutch unit at the Bandung Technical College in Java. Initially some of the FECB people went there after the fall of Singapore. Lieutenant-Commander Leo Brouwer RNN, a Japanese linguist at Kamer 14 was evacuated to Colombo, then Kilindini, and later Hut 7.\n\nWith the Japanese advance down the Malay Peninsula, the Army and RAF codebreakers went to the Wireless Experimental Centre in Delhi, India.\n\nThe RN codebreakers went to Colombo, Ceylon in January 1942, on the troopship HMS Devonshire (with 12 codebreakers' cars as deck cargo). Pembroke College, an Indian boys school, was requisitioned as a combined codebreaking and wireless interception centre. The FECB worked for Admiral Sir James Somerville, commander-in-chief of the Royal Navy's Eastern Fleet. \n\nInitially the Bureau wanted to move to Australia, but were reportedly told by the Director of Signals Communication, Lieutenant Commander J. B. Newman that facilities were not available (though many have since been baffled why they were told that).\n\nIn April 1942 most of the RN codebreakers at Colombo moved to Kilindini near Mombasa in Kenya, because of a Japanese task force attack on Colombo. Two codebreakers and the civilian wireless operators were left in Colombo. An Indian boys school at Allidina about a mile outside Mombasa and overlooking the Indian Ocean was requisitioned, hence the name \"HMS Allidina\".\n\nRadio reception was even worse than at Colombo, with only the strongest Japanese signals received. In addition, FRUMEL – the US-Australian-British unit based in Melbourne that replaced CAST – was reluctant to exchange material. The American commander Rudolph Fabian was a difficult man to work with, was prejudiced against the British and had a personality clash with Eric Nave (although Nave was Australian, he was a Royal Navy officer). There were also complaints about Fabian and Frumel from MacArthur's headquarters, although MacArthur was not particularly concerned.\n\nBut in September 1942 Kilindini was able to break the Japanese Merchant Shipping Code (JN-40), because a message was sent twice with extra data. It was a transposition cypher, not a super-enciphered code like JN-25. They also broke JN-152 a simple transposition and substitution cypher for navigation warnings and the previously impenetrable JN-167, another merchant shipping cypher. These successes enabled Allied forces e.g. submarines to attack Japanese supply ships, and resulted in the Japanese merchant marine suffering 90 per cent losses by August 1945.\n\nFECB then moved back to Colombo; the move began in August 1943, with the advance party arriving in Ceylon on 1 September. Eight Wren Typex operators were killed in February 1944, when their ship the \"Khedive Ismail\" en route from Kenya to Ceylon was sunk by a Japanese submarine.\n\nThe location chosen was the Anderson Golf Course six miles from Colombo HQ, hence the name \"HMS Anderson\". Bruce Keith had wanted an up-country site for better reception, but the Chief of Intelligence staff for HQ Eastern Fleet insisted that the codebreakers should be within easy reach of headquarters. While reception was better than at Kilindini, it was affected by a nearby 33 Kv power line and the Racecourse Aerodrome.\n\nPaymaster Arthur (Harry) Shaw was a Royal Navy codebreaker at the FECB on Hong Kong and then Singapore. He founded the FECB, and headed the diplomatic section. His rank was Paymaster Captain, later Lieutenant Commander.

Representatives from the de facto Micheletti government and deposed President Manuel Zelaya reached the agreement after several weeks of diplomatic dialogue in late 2009.\n\nThe Guaymuras dialogue began after the failure of the San José accord to achieve a diplomatic solution to the 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis. The dialogue involved representatives from both Roberto Michelleti and Manuel Zelaya, and was facilitated initially by Oscar Arias.\n\nOn 30 October 2009, the Organization of American States announced that representatives from both Micheletti and Zelaya had reached an agreement that would place the decision to restore Zelaya to the presidency in the hands of the National Congress. The content and image of the signed accord was released to the public.\n\nPreamble\n\nWe, Honduran citizens, men and women convinced of the necessity to strengthen the state of law, to aid our constitution and the laws of our Republic, deepen democracy and assure a climate of peace and tranquility for our people, have carried out a frank and intense process of political dialogue to seek a negotiated and peaceful exit to the crisis in which our country has been submerged in recent months.\n\nAs fruit of this dialogue in which has predominated the wisdom, tolerance, and patriotic spirit of all the participants, we have drafted a political accord that will permit the reestablishment of civic harmony and assure a proper climate for democratic governability in our country. This accord, we are sure, will define the road to peace, reconciliation, and democracy, urgent demands of Honduran society.\n\nThe agreement on this accord demonstrates yet again, that Honduran men and women are capable of successfully carrying out dialogue and thanks to that and by means of it, reach the high goals that society demands and the country requires.\n\nIn virtue of the forgoing, we have agreed on the following accords:\n\nTo achieve reconciliation and strengthen democracy, we will form a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation made up of representatives of the various political parties and social organizations, recognized for their capabilities, honesty, aptness, and willingness to dialogue, who will occupy the distinct secretariates and subsecretariates, as well as other dependencies of State, in conformity with article 246 and following of the constitution of the Republic of Honduras.\n\nIn light of the fact that before the 28 of June, the Executive Power had not submitted a General Budget of Income and Expenses for consideration to the National Congress, in conformity with that established in article 205, number 32 of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, this government of unity and national reconciliation will respect and function on the basis of the general budget, recently approved by the National Congress for fiscal year 2009.\n\nTo achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, we reiterate our respect for the Constitution and the laws of our country, abstaining from making calls for the convening of a National Constituent Assembly, in direct or indirect manner and renouncing also promoting or aiding any popular poll with the goal of reforming the Constitution in order to permit presidential re-election, modify the form of government or contravene any of the irreformable articles of our Magna Carta.\n\nIn particular, we will not make public declarations nor exercise any type of influence inconsistent with articles 5; 373 and 373 [sic: 374?] of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, and we reject energetically every manifestation contrary to the spirit of said articles and of the special law that regulates the referendum and the plebiscite.\n\nTo achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, we reiterate that, in conformity with the articles 44 and 51 of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, the vote is universal, obligatory, egalitarion, direct, free and secret, and it corresponds to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, with full autonomy and independence, to supervise and execute everything related to the electoral acts and processes.\n\nAt the same time, we make a call to the Honduran people to peacefully participate in the next general elections and to avoid all kinds of demonstrations that would oppose the elections or their results, or promote insurrection, antijuridical conduct, civil disobedience or other acts that could produce violent confrontations or transgressions of the law.\n\nWith the goal of demonstrating the transparency and legitimacy of the electoral process, we ask urgently that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal that it authorize and accredit the presence of international missions from now until the declaration of the results of the general elections, as well as the transfer of powers that will take place, in conformity with Article 237 of the Constitution of the Republic, the 27 of January 2010.\n\nTo reach reconciliation and fortify democracy, we affirm our will to comply in all its measures with article 272 of the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras, according to which the Armed Forces remain at the disposition of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal from one month before the general elections, for the purpose of guaranteeing the free exercise of suffrage, the custody, transparency, and guarding of the electoral materials and all the other aspects of security of the process. We reaffirm the professional, apolitical, obedient and non-deliberative character of the Honduran Armed Forces. In the same way, we agree that the national police should be strictly subject to that prescribed in its special legislation.\n\nTo achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, in the spirit of the themes of the proposed San Jose Accord, both negotiating commissions have decided, respectfully, that the National Congress, as an institutional expression of popular sovereignty, in the use of its powers, in consultation with the points that the Supreme Court of Justice should consider pertinent and in conformity with the law, should resolve in that proceeding in respect to \"return the incumbency of Executive Power to its state previous to the 28 of June until the conclusion of the present governmental period, the 27 of January of 2010\". The decision that the National Congress adopts should lay the foundations to achieve social peace, political tranquility and governability that society demands and the country needs\".\n\nTo achieve reconciliation and fortify democracy, we are disposed to the creation of a Commission of Verification of the promises assumed in this Accord, and of those that shall derive from it, coordinated by the Organization of American States (OAS). Said commission will be made up of two members of the international community and two members of the national community, these last will be sought one by each of the parties.\n\nThe Verification Commission will be charged with giving witness of the strict completion of all of the points of this Accord, and will receive for this the full cooperation of Honduran public institutions.\nIncompletion of any of the commitments contained in this Accord, proven and declared by the Verification Commission, will produce the activation of measures that the Commission will establish against the transgressor or transgressors.\n\nWith the goal of clarifying the deeds that occurred before and after the 28 of June 2009, there will also be created a Truth Commission that will identify the acts that led to the present situation, and provide to the Honduran people elements to avoid that those deeds will be repeated in the future.\nThis Commission of Dialogue recommends that the next Government, in the framework of a national consensus, constitutes the said Truth Commission in the first half of the year 2010.\n\nOn committing ourselves to faithfully comply with the promises assumed in the present Accord, we respectfully ask the immediate revocation of those measures and sanctions adopted at a bilateral or multilateral level, that in any manner would affect the reinsertion and full participation of the Republic of Honduras in the international community and its access to all forms of cooperation.\n\nWe make a call to the international community that it should reactivate as soon as possible the projects of cooperation in effect with the Republic of Honduras and continue with the negotiation of future ones. In particular, we ask urgently that, on the request of competent authorities the international cooperation be made effective that might be necessary and opportune for the Verification Commission and the future Truth Commission to assure the faithful completion and follow-through of the commitments acquired in this Accord.\n\nAny difference in interpretation or application of the present Accord will be submitted to the Verification Commission, which will determine, in keeping with that disposed in the Constitution of the Republic of Honduras and in the legislation in effect and through an authentic interpretation of the present Accord, the solution that corresponds.\n\nTaking into account that the present Accord is a product of the understanding and fraternity among Honduran men and women, we ask vehemently that the international community respect the sovereignty of the Republic of Honduras, and fully observe the time-honored principle in the Charter of the United Nations of non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\n\nGiven the immediate entrance into effect of this accord from the date of its signing, and with the goal of clarifying the timetable for completion and follow-through of the commitments acquired to reach national reconciliation, we agree on the following calendar of completion:\n\n1. Signing and entry into effect of the accord.\n2. Formal delivery of the accords to Congress for the effects of point 5, of \"Executive Power\".\n\n1. Appointment of the Verification Commission\n\n1. Appointment and installation of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation\n\n1. Celebrate the transfer of government\n\n1. Formation of the Truth Commission\n\nIn the name of reconciliation and the patriotic spirit that has convened us at the table of dialogue, we commit to complete in good faith the present Accord and that which derives from it.\n\nThe world is witness to that demonstration of unity and peace, to which we commit our civic conscience, and patriotic devotation. Together, we shall know to demonstrate our valor and determination to fortify the State of Law and construct a tolerant, pluralistic, and democratic society.\n\nWe sign the present Accord in the city of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, the 30th of October 2009.\n\nWe take advantage of the occasion to thank the accompaniment of the good offices of the international community, in particular the OAS, and its Secretary General, Jose Miguel Insulza, the Missions of Chancellors of the Hemisphere; the President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias Sanchez; the ultimate government of the United States, its president Barack Obama; and its Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor internal effects, the Accord has full effectiveness from its signing.\n\nFor effects of protocol and ceremony, there will be carried out a public act of signing on the 2nd of November 2009.\n\nMicheletti asked Zelaya to provide him with a list of candidates that Micheletti could select from and include in a unity government. Zelaya chose not to give a list of candidates to Micheletti—arguing that he should be at the head of any unity government—while several of the other parties did submit names for consideration. Zelaya also stated that the Congress was unacceptably delaying the agreed-upon vote on his restoration.\n\nZelaya had hoped to be back in office by November 5, the deadline for the two sides to establish a power-sharing government. \"By Thursday, the government of national unity should be installed,\" he said in a meeting broadcast by Radio Globo. \"By that day, point No. 5 has to be resolved,\" he added, referring to the clause of the agreement that covers his return to office. In fact, the accord did not establish a firm deadline by which Congress has to make a final decision on Zelaya's reinstatement, Organization of American States Political Affairs Secretary Victor Rico noted following Zelaya's comments. \"There is no timeframe for Zelaya to return to office,\" he said. \"Only Congress can make that determination.\"\n\nWhen Micheletti announced he had formed what he called the unity government without input from Zelaya, Zelaya declared the agreement \"dead\" early on November 6. Diplomats from the United States have attempted to revive the pact since then through public statements and private meetings with the two parties. Zelaya insisted that he would not accept any deal to restore him to office if it means he must recognize the elections as a prerequisite to returning to power.\n\n\n"}

For the next twenty months, Iran and the P5+1 countries engaged in negotiations, and in April 2015 agreed on an Iran nuclear deal framework for the final agreement. In July 2015, Iran and the P5+1 confirmed agreement on the plan along with the \"Roadmap Agreement\" made between Iran and the IAEA.\n\nUnder the agreement, Iran agreed to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium, cut its stockpile of low-enriched uranium by 98%, and reduce by about two-thirds the number of its gas centrifuges for 13 years. For the next 15 years, Iran will only enrich uranium up to 3.67%. Iran also agreed not to build any new heavy-water facilities for the same period of time. Uranium-enrichment activities will be limited to a single facility using first-generation centrifuges for 10 years. Other facilities will be converted to avoid proliferation risks. To monitor and verify Iran's compliance with the agreement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will have regular access to all Iranian nuclear facilities. The agreement provides that in return for verifiably abiding by its commitments, Iran will receive relief from U.S., European Union, and United Nations Security Council nuclear-related economic sanctions.\n\nOn 13 October 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States would not make the certification provided for under U.S. domestic law, but stopped short of terminating the deal. On 30 April 2018, the United States and Israel stated that Iran did not disclose a past covert nuclear weapons program to the IAEA, which was required in the 2015 deal.\n\nIAEA inspectors spend 3,000 calendar days per year in Iran, installing tamper-proof seals and collecting surveillance camera photos, measurement data and documents for further analysis. IAEA Director Yukiya Amano stated (in March 2018) that the organization has verified that Iran is implementing its nuclear-related commitments.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the agreement. Following the U.S.'s withdrawal, the EU enacted an updated blocking statute on 7 August 2018 to nullify US sanctions on countries trading with Iran.\n\nA nuclear weapon uses a fissile material to cause a nuclear chain reaction. The most commonly used materials have been uranium 235 (U-235) and plutonium 239 (Pu-239). Both uranium 233 (U-233) and reactor-grade plutonium have also been used. The amount of uranium or plutonium needed depends on the sophistication of the design, with a simple design requiring approximately 15 kg of uranium or 6 kg of plutonium and a sophisticated design requiring as little as 9 kg of uranium or 2 kg of plutonium. Plutonium is almost nonexistent in nature, and natural uranium is about 99.3% uranium 238 (U-238) and 0.7% U-235. Therefore, to make a weapon, either uranium must be enriched, or plutonium must be produced. Uranium enrichment is also frequently necessary for nuclear power. For this reason, uranium enrichment is a dual-use technology, a technology which \"can be used both for civilian and for military purposes\". Key strategies to prevent proliferation of nuclear arms include limiting the number of operating uranium enrichment plants and controlling the export of nuclear technology and fissile material.\n\nIranian development of nuclear technology began in the 1970s, when the U.S. Atoms for Peace program began providing assistance to Iran, which was then led by the Shah. Iran signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1968 as a non-nuclear weapons state and ratified the NPT in 1970.\n\nIn 1979 the Iranian Revolution took place, and Iran's nuclear program, which had developed some baseline capacity, fell to disarray as \"much of Iran's nuclear talent fled the country in the wake of the Revolution.\" Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was initially opposed to nuclear technology; and Iran engaged in a costly war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988.\n\nStarting in the later 1980s, Iran restarted its nuclear program, with assistance from Pakistan (which entered into a bilateral agreement with Iran in 1992), China (which did the same in 1990), and Russia (which did the same in 1992 and 1995), and from the A.Q. Khan network. Iran \"began pursuing an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle capability by developing a uranium mining infrastructure and experimenting with uranium conversion and enrichment\". According to the nonpartisan Nuclear Threat Initiative, \"U.S. intelligence agencies have long suspected Iran of using its civilian nuclear program as a cover for clandestine weapons development.\" Iran, in contrast, \"has always insisted that its nuclear work is peaceful\".\n\nIn August 2002, the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran, an Iranian dissident group, publicly revealed the existence of two undeclared nuclear facilities, the Arak heavy-water production facility and the Natanz enrichment facility. In February 2003, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami acknowledged the existence of the facilities and asserted that Iran had undertaken \"small-scale enrichment experiments\" to produce low-enriched uranium for nuclear power plants. In late February, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors visited Natanz. In May 2003, Iran allowed IAEA inspectors to visit the Kalaye Electric Company, but refused to allow them to take samples, and an IAEA report the following month concluded that Iran had failed to meet its obligations under the previous agreement.\n\nIn June 2003, Iran—faced with the prospect of being referred to the UN Security Council—entered into diplomatic negotiations with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (the EU 3). The United States refused to be involved in these negotiations. In October 2003, the Tehran Declaration was reached between Iran and the EU 3; under this declaration Iran agreed to cooperate fully with the IAEA, sign the Additional Protocol, and temporarily suspend all uranium enrichment. In September and October 2003, the IAEA conducted several facility inspections. This was followed by the Paris Agreement in November 2004, in which Iran agreed to temporarily suspend enrichment and conversion activities, \"including the manufacture, installation, testing, and operation of centrifuges, and committed to working with the EU-3 to find a mutually beneficial long-term diplomatic solution\".\n\nIn August 2005, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a hard-liner, was elected president of Iran. He accused Iranian negotiators who had negotiated the Paris Accords of treason. Over the next two months, the EU 3 agreement fell apart as talks over the EU 3's proposed Long Term Agreement broke down; the Iranian government \"felt that the proposal was heavy on demands, light on incentives, did not incorporate Iran's proposals, and violated the Paris Agreement\". Iran notified the IAEA that it would resume uranium conversion at Esfahan.\n\nIn February 2006, Iran ended its voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol and resumed enrichment at Natanz, prompting the IAEA Board of Governors to refer Iran to the UN Security Council. After the vote, Iran announced it would resume enrichment of uranium. In April 2006, Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had nuclear technology, but stated that it was purely for power generation and not for producing weapons. In June 2006, the EU 3 joined China, Russia, and the United States, to form the P5+1. The following month, July 2006, the UN Security Council passed its first resolution demanding Iran stop uranium enrichment and processing. Altogether, from 2006 to 2010, the UN Security Council subsequently adopted six resolutions concerning Iran's nuclear program: 1696 (July 2006), 1737 (December 2006), 1747 (March 2007), 1803 (March 2008), 1835 (September 2008), and 1929 (June 2010). The legal authority for the IAEA Board of Governors referral and the Security Council resolutions was derived from the IAEA Statute and the United Nations Charter. The resolutions demanded that Iran cease enrichment activities and imposed sanctions on Iran, including bans on the transfer of nuclear and missile technology to the country and freezes on the assets of certain Iranian individuals and entities, in order to pressure the country. However, in Resolution 1803 and elsewhere the Security Council also acknowledged Iran's rights under Article IV of the NPT, which provides for \"the inalienable right ... to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes\".\n\nIn July 2006, Iran opened the Arak heavy water production plant, which led to one of the Security Council resolutions. In September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama, revealed the existence of an underground enrichment facility in Fordow, near Qom saying, \"Iran's decision to build yet another nuclear facility without notifying the IAEA represents a direct challenge to the basic compact at the center of the non-proliferation regime.\" Israel threatened to take military action against Iran.\n\nIn a February 2007 interview with the \"Financial Times\", IAEA director general Mohamed ElBaradei said that military action against Iran \"would be catastrophic, counterproductive\" and called for negotiations between the international community and Iran over the Iranian nuclear program. ElBaradei specifically proposed a \"double, simultaneous suspension, a time out\" as \"a confidence-building measure\", under which the international sanctions would be suspended and Iran would suspend enrichment. ElBaradei also said, \"if I look at it from a weapons perspective there are much more important issues to me than the suspension of [enrichment],\" naming his top priorities as preventing Iran from \"go[ing] to industrial capacity until the issues are settled\"; building confidence, with \"full inspection\" involving Iranian adoption of the Additional Protocol; and \"at all costs\" preventing Iran from \"moving out of the [treaty-based non-proliferation] system\".\n\nA November 2007 U.S. National Intelligence Estimate assessed that Iran \"halted its nuclear weapons program\" in 2003; that estimate and subsequent U.S. Intelligence Community statements also assessed that the Iranian government at the time had was \"keeping open the 'option' to develop nuclear weapons\" in the future. A July 2015 Congressional Research Service report said, \"statements from the U.S. intelligence community indicate that Iran has the technological and industrial capacity to produce nuclear weapons at some point, but the U.S. government assesses that Tehran has not mastered all of the necessary technologies for building a nuclear weapon.\"\nIn March 2013, the United States began a series of secret bilateral talks with Iranian officials in Oman, led by William Joseph Burns and Jake Sullivan on the American side and Ali Asghar Khaji on the Iranian side. In June 2013, Hassan Rouhani was elected president of Iran. Rouhani has been described as \"more moderate, pragmatic and willing to negotiate than Ahmadinejad\". However, in a 2006 nuclear negotiation with European powers, Rouhani said that Iran had used the negotiations to dupe the Europeans, saying that during the negotiations, Iran managed to master the conversion of uranium yellowcake at Isfahan. The conversion of yellowcake is an important step in the nuclear fuel process. In August 2013, three days after his inauguration, Rouhani called for a resumption of serious negotiations with the P5+1 on the Iranian nuclear program. In September 2013, Obama and Rouhani had a telephone conversation, the first high-level contact between U.S. and Iranian leaders since 1979, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had a meeting with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, signaling that the two countries had an opening to cooperation. Former officials alleged that, in order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency. As a result of the Politico report, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered an investigation to determine the veracity of the allegations.\n\nAfter several rounds of negotiations, on 24 November 2013, the Joint Plan of Action, an interim agreement on the Iranian nuclear program, was signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It consisted of a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for decreased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries work towards a long-term agreement. The IAEA began \"more intrusive and frequent inspections\" under this interim agreement. The agreement was formally activated on 20 January 2014. On that day, the IAEA issued a report stating that Iran was adhering to the terms of the interim agreement, including stopping enrichment of uranium to 20 percent, beginning the dilution process (to reduce half of the stockpile of 20 percent enriched uranium to 3.5 percent), and halting work on the Arak heavy-water reactor.\n\nA major focus on the negotiations was limitations on Iran's key nuclear facilities: the Arak IR-40 heavy water reactor and production plant (which was under construction, but never became operational, as Iran agreed as part of the November 2013 Joint Plan of Action (interim agreement) not to commission or fuel the reactor); the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant; the Gachin uranium mine; the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant; the Isfahan uranium-conversion plant; the Natanz uranium enrichment plant; and the Parchin military research and development complex.\n\nThe agreement between the P5+1+EU and Iran on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is the culmination of 20 months of \"arduous\" negotiations.\n\nThe agreement followed the Joint Plan of Action (JPA), an interim agreement between the P5+1 powers and Iran that was agreed to on 24 November 2013 at Geneva. The Geneva agreement was an interim deal, in which Iran agreed to roll back parts of its nuclear program in exchange for relief from some sanctions. This went into effect on 20 January 2014. The parties agreed to extend their talks with a first extension deadline on 24 November 2014 and a second extension deadline set to 1 July 2015.\n\nAn Iran nuclear deal framework was reached on 2 April 2015. Under this framework Iran agreed tentatively to accept restrictions on its nuclear program, all of which would last for at least a decade and some longer, and to submit to an increased intensity of international inspections under a framework deal. These details were to be negotiated by the end of June 2015. The negotiations toward a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action were extended several times until the final agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was finally reached on 14 July 2015. The JCPOA is based on the framework agreement from three months earlier.\n\nSubsequently the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 continued. In April 2015, a framework deal was reached at Lausanne. Intense marathon negotiations then continued, with the last session in Vienna at the Palais Coburg lasting for seventeen days. At several points, negotiations appeared to be at risk of breaking down, but negotiators managed to come to agreement. As the negotiators neared a deal, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry directly asked Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to confirm that he was \"authorized to actually make a deal, not just by the [Iranian] president, but by the supreme leader?\" Zarif gave assurances that he was.\n\nUltimately, on 14 July 2015, all parties agreed to a landmark comprehensive nuclear agreement. At the time of the announcement, shortly before 11:00 GMT, the agreement was released to the public.\n\nThe final agreement's complexity shows the impact of a public letter written by a bipartisan group of 19 U.S. diplomats, experts, and others in June 2015, written when negotiations were still going on. That letter outlined concerns about the several provisions in the then-unfinished agreement and called for a number of improvements to strengthen the prospective agreement and win their support for it. After the final agreement was reached, one of the signatories, Robert J. Einhorn, a former U.S. Department of State official now at the Brookings Institution, said of the agreement: \"Analysts will be pleasantly surprised. The more things are agreed to, the less opportunity there is for implementation difficulties later on.\"\n\nThe final agreement is based upon (and buttresses) \"the rules-based nonproliferation regime created by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and including especially the IAEA safeguards system\".\n\nThe JCPOA is part of resolution 2231 voted by every member of the UN Security Council, with following timetable:\n\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) runs to 109 pages, including five annexes. Major provisions of the final accord include the following:\n\n\nAs a result of the above, the \"breakout time\"—the time in which it would be possible for Iran to make enough material for a single nuclear weapon—will increase from two to three months to one year, according to U.S. officials and U.S. intelligence. An August 2015 report published by a group of experts at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs concurs in these estimates, writing that under the JCPOA, \"over the next decade would be extended to roughly a year, from the current estimated breakout time of 2 to 3 months\". The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation also accepts these estimates. By contrast, Alan J. Kuperman, coordinator of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Project at the University of Texas at Austin, disputed the one-year assessment, arguing that under the agreement, Iran's breakout time \"would be only about three months, not much longer than it is today\".\n\nThe longer breakout time would be in place for at least ten years; after that point, the breakout time would gradually decrease. By the fifteenth year, U.S. officials state that the breakout time would return to the pre-JCPOA status quo of a few months. The Belfer Center report states: \"Some contributors to this report believe that breakout time by year 15 could be comparable to what it is today—a few months—while others believe it could be reduced to a few weeks.\"\n\nReuters reported that exemptions were granted to Iran prior to 16 January 2016. The reported purpose of the exemptions was so that sanctions relief and other benefits could start by that date, instead of Iran being in violation. The exemptions included: (a) Iran able to exceed the 300 Kg of 3.5% LEU limit in the agreement; (b) Iran able to exceed the zero Kg of 20% LEU limit in the agreement; (c) Iran to keep operating 19 \"hot cells\" that exceed the size limit in the agreement; (d) Iran to maintain control of 50 tonnes of heavy water that exceed the 130 tonne limit in the agreement by storing the excess at an Iran-controlled facility in Oman. In December 2016, the IAEA published decisions of the Joint Commission that spell out these clarifications of the JCPOA.\n\nThe following provisions regarding sanctions are written into the JCPOA:\n\nAnkit Panda of \"The Diplomat\" states that this will make impossible any scenario where Iran is non-compliant with the JCPOA yet escapes re-imposition of sanctions. Mark Dubowitz of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (which opposes the agreement) argues, however, that because the JCPOA provides that Iran could treat reinstatement of sanctions (in part or entirely) as grounds for leaving the agreement, the United States would be reluctant to impose a \"snapback\" for smaller violations: \"The only thing you'll take to the Security Council are massive Iranian violations, because you're certainly not going to risk the Iranians walking away from the deal and engaging in nuclear escalation over smaller violations.\"\n\nAfter the 15 years, the treaty will come to its term; then the extraordinary restrictions will no longer be applicable.\n\nAt that time, in 2030, it is understood that people involved in the 1979 revolution will no more be politically active.\n\nSome critics of the treaty consider as plausible that at its expiration Iran could make a bomb.\n\nIn the same time, with this treaty Iran also ratified the Additional Protocol of the NPT and so, be subject to inspection and oversight by the IAEA after this delay.\n\nAccording to several commentators, JCPOA is the first of its kind in the annals of non-proliferation and is in many aspects unique. The 159-page JCPOA document and its five appendices, is the most spacious text of a multinational treaty since World War II, according to BBC Persian.\n\nThis is the first time that the United Nations Security Council has recognized the nuclear enrichment program of a developing country and backs an agreement signed by several countries within the framework of a resolution (United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231). For the first time in the history of the United Nations, a country—Iran—was able to abolish 6 UN resolutions against it—1696, 1737, 1747, 1803, 1835, 1929—without even one day of implementing them. Sanctions against Iran was also lifted for the first time.\n\nThroughout the history of international law, this is the first and only time that a country subject to Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter has managed to end its case and stop being subject to this chapter through diplomacy. All other cases have ended through either regime change, war or full implementation of the Security Council's decisions by the country.\n\nGary Sick states that during the history of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), no country other than Iran has ever voluntarily agreed to put such extraordinary restrictions on its nuclear activities.\n\nDuring the final negotiations, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry stayed in Vienna for 17 days, making him the top American official devoting time to a single international negotiation in more than four decades. Mohammad Javad Zarif broke the record of an Iranian Foreign Minister being far from home with 18-days stay in Vienna, and set the record of 106 days of negotiations in 687 days, a number higher than any other chief nuclear negotiator in 12 years. The negotiations became the longest continuous negotiations with the presence of all foreign ministers of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nThe negotiations included 'rare events' in Iran–United States relations not only since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, but also in the history of the bilateral relations. The U.S. Secretary of State and Iranian Foreign Minister met on 18 different dates—sometimes multiple occasions a day—and in 11 different cities, unprecedented since the beginning of the relations. On 27 April 2015, John Kerry visited the official residence of the Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations to meet his counterpart. The encounter was the first of its kind since the Iran hostage crisis. On the sidelines of the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly, U.S. President Barack Obama shook hands with the Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, marking the first such event in history. The event was also noted in form of diplomatic ranks, as a head of state shook hands with a minister. Obama is reported to have said in the meeting: \"Too much effort has been put into the JCPOA and we all should be diligent to implement it.\"\n\nThere was a significant worldwide response following the announcement of the agreement; more than 90 countries endorsed the agreement, as did many international organizations.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the unveiling of the agreement, \"a general consensus quickly emerged\" among nuclear experts and watchdogs that the agreement \"is as close to a best-case situation as reality would allow\". In August 2015, 75 arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts signed a statement endorsing the deal as \"a net-plus for international nuclear nonproliferation efforts\" that exceeds the historical standards for arms control agreements. The \"Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" invited top international security experts to comment on the final agreement.\n\nThe American TV series \"Madam Secretary\" built a whole season around the negotiations. Five years before the deal, in \"24\"s season 8, the negotiations between the United States leaders and \"President Hassan\" of \"Islamic republic of Kamistan\" to abandon his nuclear technology programme was shown, which drew comparison to the US-Iran dispute. However the deal was contrarily to \"Homeland\"s season 3 plot that \"fueled nuclear paranoia\" against Iran.\n\nAfter the deal, a joke began circulating in Iran that the name of city of Arak would change to \"Barack\" in honor of Obama, and that in return, the United States would change the name of Manhattan borough to \"Mash Hassan\" () which is a very casual way of referring to Rouhani.\n\nJavad Zarif's efforts in the negotiations drew comparisons to mythological Arash the Archer, and two former Prime Ministers: Mohammad Mosaddegh, who led the withdrawal of foreigners and nationalization of the Iranian oil industry and was overthrown by American–British coup d'état, because both fought foreigners for Iran's rights; and Amir Kabir, because both faced domestic hostility through their way to gain more interest for the nation.\n\nPublic polling on the issue has yielded varied and sometimes contradictory results, depending on the question wording, whether the poll explains the provisions of the agreement, and whether an \"undecided\" option is offered. Polls have consistently shown polarization by party affiliation, with majorities of self-identified Democrats supporting the agreement and majorities of self-identified Republicans opposing it.\n\n\n\n\nAs provided for in the JCPOA, the agreement was formally endorsed by the UN Security Council, incorporating it into international law. There was initially disagreement on if the deal is legally binding on the United States.\n\nOn 15 July 2015, the American ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, circulated a fourteen-page draft to Council members. On 20 July 2015, the Security Council unanimously approved the fourteen-page resolution—United Nations Security Council resolution 2231—in a 15–0 vote. The resolution delays its official implementation for 90 days, to allow for U.S. Congressional consideration under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. The resolution lays out the steps for terminating sanctions imposed by seven past Security Council resolutions, but retains an arms embargo and ballistic missile technology ban. The resolution also did not affect the sanctions imposed separately by the United States and the European Union. The resolution also codifies the \"snapback\" mechanism of the agreement, under which all Security Council sanctions will be automatically reimposed if Iran breaches the deal.\n\nSpeaking immediately after the vote, Power told the Security Council that sanctions relief would start only when Iran \"verifiably\" met its obligations. Power also called upon Iran \"to immediately release all unjustly detained Americans\", specifically naming Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and Jason Rezaian, were imprisoned by Iran was detained at the time, and Robert A. Levinson, who has been missing in the country. Hekmati, Abedini, and Rezaian were subsequently released in a January 2016 prisoner exchange, which Secretary of State Kerry said had been accelerated by the nuclear agreement.\n\nOn the same day that the Security Council approved a resolution, the European Union formally approved the JCPOA via a vote of the EU Foreign Affairs Council (the group of EU foreign ministers) meeting in Brussels. This sets into motion the lifting of certain EU sanctions, including those prohibiting the purchase of Iranian oil. The EU continues its sanctions relating to human rights and its sanctions prohibiting the export of ballistic missile technology. The approval by the EU was seen as a signal to the U.S. Congress.\n\nUnder U.S. law, the JCPOA is a non-binding political commitment. According to the U.S. State Department, it specifically is not an executive agreement or a treaty. There are widespread incorrect reports that it is an executive agreement. In contrast to treaties, which require two-thirds of the Senate to consent to ratification, political commitments require no congressional approval, and are not legally binding as a matter of domestic law (although in some cases they may be binding on the U.S. as a matter of international law).\n\nOn 22 May 2015, President Obama signed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 into law; this legislation passed by the Senate in a 98-1 vote and the House in a 400-25 vote, and was approved by President Obama on 22 May 2015. Under the Act, once a nuclear agreement was negotiated with Iran, Congress had sixty days in which it could pass a resolution of approval, a resolution of disapproval, or do nothing. The Act also included additional time beyond the sixty days for the president to veto a resolution and for Congress to take a vote on whether to override or sustain the veto. Republicans could only defeat the deal if they mustered the two-thirds of both houses of Congress needed to override an expected veto by Obama of any resolution of disapproval.\n\nOn 19 July 2015, the State Department officially transmitted to Congress the JCPOA, its annexes, and related materials. These documents included the Unclassified Verification Assessment Report on the JCPOA and the Intelligence Community's Classified Annex to the Verification Assessment Report. The sixty-day review period began the next day, 20 July, and ended 17 September. Senator Ted Cruz introduced a resolution seeking a delay in the review period, arguing that the sixty-day congressional review under the Act should not begin until the Senate obtains a copy of all bilateral Iran-IAEA documents. This resolution did not pass. Ultimately, a resolution of disapproval was brought to the Senate floor, but failed. A resolution of approval was brought to the House floor, but it, too, failed. As a result, the agreement went into effect following congressional review period.\n\nThe international community had long sought a landmark diplomatic agreement with Iran on its nuclear program, and such an agreement was also a long-sought foreign-policy goal of the Obama administration.\n\nIn comments made in the East Room of the White House on 15 July 2015, President Obama urged Congress to support the agreement, saying \"If we don't choose wisely, I believe future generations will judge us harshly, for letting this moment slip away.\" Obama stated that the inspections regime in the agreement was among the most vigorous ever negotiated, and criticized opponents of the deal for failing to offer a viable alternative to it. Obama stated: \"If 99 percent of the world's community and the majority of nuclear experts look at this thing and they say 'this will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb,' and you are arguing either that it does not ... then you should have some alternative to present. And I haven't heard that.\" The same day, Obama made a case for the deal on the agreement in an interview with \"New York Times\" columnist Thomas Friedman. Obama stated:\n\nAlso on 15 July, Vice President Joe Biden met with Senate Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill, where he made a presentation on the agreement.\n\nOn 18 July, Obama devoted his weekly radio address to the agreement, stating, \"this deal will make America and the world safer and more secure\" and rebutting \"a lot of overheated and often dishonest arguments about it\". Obama stated \"as commander-in-chief, I make no apology for keeping this country safe and secure through the hard work of diplomacy over the easy rush to war.\" On 23 July, President Obama met in the White House Cabinet Room with about a dozen undecided House Democrats to speak about the agreement and seek their support.\n\nThe debate over the agreement was marked by acrimony between the White House and with Republicans inside and outside of Congress. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said that under the agreement \"the Obama administration will become the leading financier of terrorism against America in the world.\" Former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, called the president \"naive\" and repeatedly invoked the Holocaust, saying that the president's policy would \"take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven\". This comparison was denounced by the Anti-Defamation League, the National Jewish Democratic Council, and various Israeli government officials. At a 27 June news conference, Obama specifically criticized Huckabee, Cruz, and Cotton, saying that such remarks were \"just part of a general pattern we've seen that would be considered ridiculous if it weren't so sad\", especially from \"leaders in the Republican Party\". Obama stated that \"fling[ing] out ad hominem attacks like that ... doesn't help inform the American people\" and stated: \"This is a deal that has been endorsed by people like Brent Scowcroft and Sam Nunn ... historic Democratic and Republican leaders on arms control and on keeping America safe. And so when you get rhetoric like this, maybe it gets attention and maybe this is just an effort to push Mr. Trump out of the headlines, but it's not the kind of leadership that is needed for America right now.\"\n\nOn 5 August, Obama gave a speech before an audience of around 200 at American University, marking a new phase in the administration's campaign for the agreement. Obama stated: \"Let's not mince words: The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war—maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon. How can we in good conscience justify war before we've tested a diplomatic agreement that achieves our objectives?\" In his speech, Obama also invoked a speech made by John F. Kennedy at American University in 1963 in favor of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Obama also said that the opponents of the agreement were the same people who created the \"drumbeat of war\" that led to the Iraq War and criticized \"knee-jerk partisanship that has become all too familiar, rhetoric that renders every decision made to be a disaster, a surrender\".\n\nNew York Senator Chuck Schumer, a senior Democrat, made a different assessment of prospects for war by distinguishing between nuclear and non-nuclear aspects of the agreement. In each case he asked whether we are better off with the agreement or without it and his conclusion was: \"... when it comes to the nuclear aspects of the agreement within ten years, we might be slightly better off with it. However, when it comes to the nuclear aspects after ten years and the non-nuclear aspects, we would be better off without it.\" Then Schumer assessed the Iranian government, saying, \"Who's to say this dictatorship will not prevail for another ten, twenty, or thirty years? To me, the very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great.\" And, finally, Schumer concluded: \"I will vote to disapprove the agreement, not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to challenge the path of diplomacy. It is because I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power.\"\n\nIn the same speech, Obama stated: \"Just because Iranian hard-liners chant 'Death to America' does not mean that that's what all Iranians believe. In fact, it's those hard-liners who are most comfortable with the status quo. It's those hard-liners chanting 'Death to America' who have been most opposed to the deal. They're making common cause with the Republican caucus.\" This statement was criticized by congressional Republican leaders. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called it \"crass political rhetoric\" that was a strategy to \"Demonize your opponents, gin up the base, get the Democrats all angry, and rally around the president.\" McConnell said \"This is an enormous national security debate that the president will leave behind, under the Constitution, a year and a half from now, and the rest of us will be dealing with the consequences of it. So I wish he would tone down the rhetoric and let's talk about the facts\" and promised that Republicans would discuss the agreement respectfully in September. Republican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of Foreign Relations Committee, asserted that the president was \"trying to shut down debate by saying that those who have legitimate questions, legitimate questions—are somehow unpatriotic, are somehow compared to hardliners in Iran\". The president subsequently stood by his statement, with White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest calling it a \"statement of fact\" and the president saying in an interview, \"Remember, what I said was that it's the hard-liners in Iran who are most opposed to this deal. And I said, in that sense, they're making common cause with those who are opposed to this deal here. I didn't say that they were equivalent.\" In the same interview, Obama said: \"A sizable proportion of the Republicans were opposed before the ink was even dry on the deal.\"\n\nIn comments made at the Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colorado in July 2015, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that the JCPOA will improve the U.S. ability to monitor Iran, saying \"[The agreement] puts us in a far better place in terms of insight and access\" than no agreement. While Clapper remains \"concerned about compliance and deceit\", but \"pointed out that during the negotiation period [Iran] complied with rules\" negotiated under the interim agreement (the Joint Plan of Action).\n\nAn intense public debate in the United States took place during the congressional review period. \"Some of the wealthiest and most powerful donors in American politics, those for and against the accord\", became involved in the public debate, although \"mega-donors\" opposing the agreement have contributed substantially more money than those supporting it. From 2010 to early August 2015, the foundations of Sheldon Adelson, Paul Singer, and Haim Saban contributed a total of $13 million (at least $7.5 million, at least $2.6 million, and at least $2.9 million, respectively) to advocacy groups opposing an agreement with Iran. On the other side, three groups lobbying in support of the agreement have received at least $803,000 from the Ploughshares Fund, at least $425,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and at least $68,500 from George Soros and his foundation. Other philanthropists and donors supporting an agreement include S. Daniel Abraham, Tim Gill, Norman Lear, Margery Tabankin, and Arnold Hiatt.\n\nMany Iranian Americans, even those who fled repression in Iran and oppose its government, welcomed the JCPOA as a step forward. The National Iranian American Council (NIAC), Iranian American Bar Association, and other Iranian American organizations welcomed the JCPOA. The NIAC released a statement saying: \"Our negotiators have done their job to win a strong nuclear deal that prevents an Iranian nuclear weapon, all the while avoiding a catastrophic war. Now is the time for Congress to do theirs. Make no mistake: if Congress rejects this good deal with Iran, there will be no better deal forthcoming and Congress will be left owning an unnecessary war.\" NIAC created a new group, NIAC Action, to run advertisements supporting the agreement. NIAC also organized an open letter from 73 Middle East and foreign affairs scholars stating, \"reactivating diplomatic channels between the United States and Iran is a necessary first step\" to reduce conflict in the region, and that while \"the nuclear deal will not automatically or immediately bring stability to the region ... Ultimately, a Middle East where diplomacy is the norm rather than the exception will enhance U.S. national security and interests,\" Signatories to the letter include John Esposito, Ehsan Yarshater, Noam Chomsky, Peter Beinart, John Mearsheimer, and Stephen Walt.\n\nU.S. pro-Israel groups divided on the JCPOA. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee opposes the agreement, and formed a new 501(c)(4) group, Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran, to run a television advertising campaign against the JCPOA. In August 2015, it was reported that AIPAC and Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran plan to spend between $20 million and $40 million on its campaign. From mid-July to 4 August 2015, AIPAC's Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran spent more than $11 million running network television political advertisements opposing the agreement in 23 states, spending more than $1 million in the large states of California, Florida, New York, and Texas. In the first week of August, AIPAC said that it had 400 meetings with congressional offices as part of its campaign to defeat the agreement.\n\nIn contrast to AIPAC, another pro-Israel organization, J Street, supports the agreement, and plans a $5 million advertising effort of its own to encourage Congress to support the agreement. During the first week of August, J Street launched a $2 million, three-week ad campaign in support of the agreement, with television ads running in Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon, and Pennsylvania. From mid-July through early August, J Street reported having 125 meetings with congressional offices. J Street has also paid to fly prominent Israelis who support the agreement (including Amram Mitzna, a retired Israeli general, member of the Knesset, and mayor of Haifa) to the United States to help persuade members of Congress to support the agreement.\n\nThe group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) opposes the agreement and committed to spending more than $20 million on a national \"TV, radio, print and digital campaign\" against the agreement. After UANI announced its opposition, the group's president and co-founder, nonproliferation expert Gary Samore, announced that he had concluded \"that the accord was in the United States' interest\" and supported the agreement. Samore thus stepped down as president and was replaced by ex-Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. By 20 August, UANI had released its third national television ad against the agreement.\nVarious other groups that have also run ad campaigns for or against the agreement. John R. Bolton's Foundation for American Security and Freedom has run advertisements against the agreement, as has \"Veterans Against the Deal\", a group which does not disclose its donors. Various pro-agreement ads were run by MoveOn.org (which ran an ad with the title \"Let Diplomacy Work\" theme), Americans United for Change (which warned \"They're back—the Iraq war hawks are fighting the Iran deal, want more war\" over photos of Bolton, Dick Cheney, and Donald Rumsfeld), and Global Zero (which ran a humorous ad featuring actors Jack Black, Morgan Freeman, and Natasha Lyonne).\n\nThe New York-based Iran Project, a nonprofit led by former high-level U.S. diplomats and funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, along with the United Nations Association of the United States, supports the agreement. The Rockefeller fund has also supported the San Francisco-based Ploughshares Fund, which has spent several years marshaling support for an agreement.\n\nOn 17 July 2015, a bipartisan open letter endorsing the Iran agreement was signed by more than 100 former U.S. ambassadors and high-ranking State Department officials. The ex-ambassadors wrote: \"If properly implemented, this comprehensive and rigorously negotiated agreement can be an effective instrument in arresting Iran's nuclear program and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons in the volatile and vitally important region of the Middle East. In our judgment the [plan] deserves Congressional support and the opportunity to show it can work. We firmly believe that the most effective way to protect U.S. national security, and that of our allies and friends is to ensure that tough-minded diplomacy has a chance to succeed before considering other more costly and risky alternatives.\" Among the signatories to the letter were Daniel C. Kurtzer, James R. Jones, Frank E. Loy, Princeton N. Lyman, Jack F. Matlock Jr., Donald F. McHenry, Thomas E. McNamara, and Thomas R. Pickering.\n\nA separate public letter to Congress in support of the agreement from five former U.S. ambassadors to Israel from administrations of both parties, and three former Under Secretaries of State was released on 26 July 2015. This letter was signed by R. Nicholas Burns, James B. Cunningham, William C. Harrop, Daniel Kurtzer, Thomas R. Pickering, Edward S. Walker Jr., and Frank G. Wisner. The former officials wrote: \"We are persuaded that this agreement will put in place a set of constraints and monitoring measures that will arrest Iran's nuclear program for at least fifteen years and assure that this agreement will leave Iran no legitimate avenue to produce a nuclear weapon during the next ten to fifteen years. This landmark agreement removes the threat that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose to the region and to Israel specifically.\"\n\nAnother public letter to Congress urging approval of the agreement was signed by a bipartisan group of more than sixty \"national-security leaders\", including politicians, retired military officers, and diplomats. This letter, dated 20 July 2015, stated: \"We congratulate President Obama and all the negotiators for a landmark agreement unprecedented in its importance for preventing the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran. ... We have followed carefully the negotiations as they have progressed and conclude that the JCPOA represents the achievement of greater security for us and our partners in the region.\" Among the Republicans who signed this letter are former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills, and former Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum. Among the Democrats who signed the letter are former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; former Senate Majority Leaders George J. Mitchell and Tom Daschle, former Senator Carl Levin, and former Defense Secretary William Perry. Also signing were former National Security Advisors Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft; Under Secretaries of State R. Nicholas Burns and Thomas R. Pickering; U.S. Ambassadors Ryan Crocker and Stuart Eizenstat; Admiral Eric T. Olson; Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy; and Assistant Secretary for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn.\n\nOn 8 August 2015, 29 prominent U.S. scientists, mostly physicists, published an open letter endorsing the agreement. The letter, addressed to President Obama, says: \"We congratulate you and your team on negotiating a technically sound, stringent and innovative deal that will provide the necessary assurance in the coming decade and more than Iran is not developing nuclear weapons, and provides a basis for further initiatives to raise the barriers to nuclear proliferation in the Middle East and around the globe.\" The letter also states that the agreement \"will advance the cause of peace and security in the Middle East and can serve as a guidepost for future nonproliferation agreements\". The 29 signatories included \"some of the world's most knowledgeable experts in the fields of nuclear weapons and arms control\", many of whom have held Q clearances and have been longtime advisers to Congress, the White House, and federal agencies. The five primary authors were Richard L. Garwin (a nuclear physicist who played a key role in the development of the first hydrogen bomb and who was described by \"The New York Times\" as \"among the last living physicists who helped usher in the nuclear age\"); Robert J. Goldston (Director of the Princeton Program on Science and Global Security and former director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory); R. Scott Kemp (an MIT professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering and a former science advisor for nonproliferation and arms control at the State Department); Rush D. Holt (a physicist and former U.S. Representative who is now the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science); and Frank N. von Hippel (Princeton Professor of Public Policy and former assistant director for national security in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy). Six Nobel Prize in Physics laureates co-signed the letter: Philip W. Anderson of Princeton University; Leon N. Cooper of Brown University; Sheldon L. Glashow of Boston University; David Gross of the University of California, Santa Barbara; Burton Richter of Stanford University; and Frank Wilczek of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Among the other scientists to sign are Siegfried S. Hecker (a Stanford physicist and the former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory); Freeman Dyson (of Princeton), and Sidney Drell (of Stanford).\n\nOn 11 August 2015, an open letter endorsing the agreement signed by 36 retired military generals and admirals, titled \"The Iran Deal Benefits U.S. National Security: An Open Letter from Retired Generals and Admirals\", was released. The letter, signed by retired officers from all five branches of the U.S. armed services, said that the agreement was \"the most effective means currently available to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons\", and said, \"If at some point it becomes necessary to consider military action against Iran, gathering sufficient international support for such an effort would only be possible if we have first given the diplomatic path a chance. We must exhaust diplomatic options before moving to military ones.\" The signers included General James E. \"Hoss\" Cartwright of the Marine Corps, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; General Joseph P. Hoar of the Marine Corps, the former commander of the U.S. Central Command; and Generals Merrill McPeak and Lloyd W. Newton of the Air Force. Other signers include Lieutenant Generals Robert G. Gard Jr. and Claudia J. Kennedy; Vice Admiral Lee F. Gunn; Rear Admirals Garland Wright and Joseph Sestak; and Major General Paul D. Eaton.\n\nThe above letter was answered on 25 August 2015, by a letter signed by more than 200 retired generals and admirals opposing the deal. The letter asserted: \"The agreement does not 'cut off every pathway' for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. To the contrary, it provides Iran with a legitimate pathway for doing exactly that simply by abiding by the deal. ... The JCPOA would threaten the national security and vital interests of the United States and, therefore, should be disapproved by the Congress.\" This letter was organized by Leon A. \"Bud\" Edney; other signers included Admiral James A. Lyons; Lieutenant General William G. Boykin, former Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence; and Lieutenant General Thomas McInerney, former vice commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe.\n\nRetired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni said that he had refused requests from both sides to sign their letters, saying to \"Time\" magazine: \"I'm convinced that 90% of the guys who signed the letter one way or the other don't have any clue about whether it's a good or bad deal. They sign it because somebody's asked them to sign it.\" As to the JCPOA Zinni said: \"The agreement's fine, if you think it can work. But if this is a Neville Chamberlain then you're in a world of shit.\"\n\nOn 13 August, retired Senators Carl Levin of Michigan, a Democrat, and John Warner of Virginia, a Republican, co-wrote an op-ed in support of the agreement—titled \"Why hawks should also back the Iran deal\"—published in \"Politico\". Levin and Warner, both past chairmen of the Senate Armed Services Committee, argued, \"If we reject the agreement, we risk isolating ourselves and damaging our ability to assemble the strongest possible coalition to stop Iran\" in the event that military action was needed in the future. Levin and Warner wrote, \"The deal on the table is a strong agreement on many counts, and it leaves in place the robust deterrence and credibility of a military option. We urge our former colleagues not to take any action which would undermine the deterrent value of a coalition that participates in and could support the use of a military option. The failure of the United States to join the agreement would have that effect.\" On 14 August, retired senators Richard Lugar of Indiana, a Republican, and J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, a Democrat, also wrote in support of the agreement. In a column for Reuters, Lugar and Johnston argued, \"Rejection of the agreement would severely undermine the U.S. role as a leader and reliable partner around the globe. If Washington walks away from this hard-fought multilateral agreement, its dependability would likely be doubted for decades.\" They also wrote: \"Tehran would be the winner of this U.S. rejection because it would achieve its major objective: the lifting of most sanctions without being required to accept constraints on its nuclear program. Iran could also claim to be a victim of American perfidy and try to convince other nations to break with U.S. leadership and with the entire international sanctions regime.\"\n\nOn 17 August 2015, a group of 75 arms control and nuclear nonproliferation experts issued a joint statement endorsing the agreement. The statement says, \"the JCPOA is a strong, long-term, and verifiable agreement that will be a net-plus for international nuclear nonproliferation efforts\" and that the JCPOA's \"rigorous limits and transparency measures will make it very likely that any future effort by Iran to pursue nuclear weapons, even a clandestine program, would be detected promptly, providing the opportunity to intervene decisively to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon\". The letter was organized through the nonpartisan Arms Control Association. Among the 75 signatories are the Valerie Plame and Joseph C. Wilson; former IAEA director-general Hans Blix; Morton H. Halperin; and experts from the Brookings Institution, Stimson Center, and other think tanks. On 3 September, an open letter to President Obama signed by 56 people was issued criticizing the JCPOA as \"unverifiable\". The letter said: \"Guided by our experience with U.S. and foreign nuclear weapons programs—as well as with the history and practice of arms control, nonproliferation, and intelligence matters, we judge the current JCPOA to be a very bad deal indeed.\" Signers included Boykin; Bolton; ex-CIA director James Woolsey, former national security advisor Robert McFarlane; Paula A. DeSutter, former Assistant Secretary of State for Verification, Compliance, and Implementation; various former ACDA officials; and former Sandia National Laboratories president/director C. Paul Robinson.\n\nForeign diplomats are also involved in the congressional debate. The Israeli ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer appeared on cable television shows to attack the agreement, while ambassadors from European nations, including Sir Peter Westmacott, the British ambassador to the United States, \"came on to say the precise opposite\". Dermer also lobbied members of Congress on Capitol Hill against the agreement, while diplomats from France, Britain, and Germany made the rounds on Capitol Hill to advocate for the agreement. On 4 August, P5+1 diplomats held \"a rare meeting of world powers' envoys on Capitol Hill\" with about 30 Senate Democrats to urge support for the agreement, saying, \"If Congress rejects this good deal, and the U.S. is forced to walk away, Iran will be left with an unconstrained nuclear program with far weaker monitoring arrangements, the current international consensus on sanctions would unravel, and international unity and pressure on Iran would be seriously undermined.\"\n\nOn \"Meet the Press\" on 6 September 2015, former Secretary of State Colin Powell expressed support for the nuclear agreement with Iran, saying that it was \"a pretty good deal\". Powell said that various provisions accepted by Iran—such as the reduction in centrifuges and the uranium stockpile and the agreement to shut down its plutonium reactor—were \"remarkable changes\" that stopped the Iranian pathway to a nuclear weapons program. Powell also defended the verification provisions of the agreement, saying: \"I think a very vigorous verification regime has been put into place.\"\n\nFormer Ambassador Dennis Ross, a longtime American negotiator in the Middle East, wrote that he was not yet convinced by either proponents or opponents of the agreement. Ross wrote that the United States should be focused on \"deterring the Iranians from cheating\" (e.g., by producing highly enriched uranium) after year fifteen of the agreement. Ross wrote, \"President Obama emphasizes that the agreement is based on verification not trust. But our catching Iran cheating is less important than the price they know they will pay if we catch them. Deterrence needs to apply not just for the life of the deal.\" As part of a deterrence strategy, Ross proposed transferring to Israel the U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) \"bunker buster\" bomb at some point before year fifteen of the agreement. In a 25 August op-ed in \"The Washington Post\", Ross and David H. Petraeus again argued for transferring the MOP to Israel.\n\nThe Jewish American community was divided on the agreement. On 19 August 2015, leaders of the Reform Jewish movement, the largest Jewish denomination in the United States, issued a lengthy public statement expressed a neutral position on the agreement. The statement, signed by the leaders of the Union for Reform Judaism, Central Conference of American Rabbis, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism and Association of Reform Zionists of America, reflected what Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the URJ, called \"deep divisions within the movement\". On 20 August 2015, a group of 26 prominent current and foreign American Jewish communal leaders published a full-page ad in \"The New York Times\" with a statement backing the agreement; signers included three former chairs of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations as well as former AIPAC executive director Tom Dine. Separately, a group of 340 rabbis organized by Ameinu issued a public letter to Congress on 17 August 2015, in support of the agreement, saying: \"We, along with many other Jewish leaders, fully support this historic nuclear accord.\" The signers were mostly Reform rabbis, but included at least 50 rabbis from the Conservative movement and at least one Orthodox rabbi. Prominent rabbis who signed this letter included Sharon Brous, Burton Visotzky, Nina Beth Cardin, Lawrence Kushner, Sharon Kleinbaum, and Amy Eilberg. In a separate letter released 27 August, eleven Democratic Jewish former members of Congress urged support for the agreement; the letter noted the signatories' pro-Israel credentials and said that the agreement \"halts the immediate threat of a nuclear-armed Iran\", while a rejection of the deal would \"put Iran back on the path to develop a nuclear weapon within two to three months\". Signatories included former Senator Carl Levin and former Representatives Barney Frank, Mel Levine, Steve Rothman, and Robert Wexler.\n\nConversely, a group of 900 rabbis signed an open letter written by Kalman Topp and Yonah Bookstein in late August, calling upon Congress to reject the agreement. The Orthodox Union and American Jewish Committee also announced opposition to the agreement.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has expressed support for the agreement. In a 14 July 2015 letter to Congress, Bishop Oscar Cantú, chairman of the Committee on International Justice and Peace of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, stated that the JCPOA was \"a momentous agreement\" which \"signals progress in global nuclear non-proliferation\". Cantú wrote that Catholic bishops in the United States \"will continue to urge Congress to endorse the result of these intense negotiations because the alternative leads toward armed conflict, an outcome of profound concern to the Church\".\n\nOn 25 August 2015, a group of 53 Christian faith leaders from a variety of denominations sent a message to Congress urging them to support the agreement. The Christian leaders wrote: \"This is a moment to remember the wisdom of Jesus who proclaimed from the Sermon on the Mount, 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God' (). ... There is no question we are all better off with this deal than without it.\" The letter was coordinated by a Quaker group, the Friends Committee on National Legislation. Signatories to the letter included Jim Wallis of Sojourners; John C. Dorhauer, general minister and president of the United Church of Christ; Shane Claiborne; Adam Estle of Evangelicals for Middle East Understanding; Archbishop Vicken Aykazian of the Armenian Orthodox Church; A. Roy Medley, the head of American Baptist Churches USA; the Reverend Paula Clayton Dempsey of the Alliance of Baptists, senior pastor Joel C. Hunter of Northland, A Church Distributed; and Sister Simone Campbell, a leader of the Catholic \"Nuns on the Bus\" campaigns.\n\nA hearing on the JCPOA before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took place on 23 July 2015. Secretary of State Kerry, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, and Energy Secretary Moniz testified. Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the committee chairman, said in his opening statement that when the talks began the goal was to dismantle the Iranian nuclear program, whereas the achieved agreement codified \"the industrialization of their nuclear program\". Corker, addressing Secretary of State Kerry, said, \"I believe you've been fleeced\" and \"... what you've really done here is you have turned Iran from being a pariah to now Congress, Congress being a pariah.\" Corker asserted that a new threshold in U.S. foreign policy was crossed and the agreement would \"enable a state sponsor of terror to obtain sophisticated, industrial nuclear development program that has, as we know, only one real practical need\". The committee's ranking Democratic member, Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, said he had many questions and his hope was that the answers will cause a debate \"in Congress and the American people\". Democrats, led by Senator Barbara Boxer of California, expressed support for the agreement, with Boxer saying that criticisms by Republicans were \"ridiculous\", \"unfair\", and \"wrong\". Corker and Cardin sent a letter to Obama saying the bilateral IAEA-Iran document should be available for Congress to review.\n\nAt the hearing Kerry, Lew, and Moniz \"were unequivocal in their statements that the accord was the best that could be achieved and that without it, the international sanctions regime would collapse\". Kerry warned that if the United States would be \"on our own\" if it were to walk away from a multi-lateral agreement alongside the five global powers. Kerry stated that the belief that \"some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Iran's complete capitulation\" could be achieved was \"a fantasy, plain and simple\". \"The Washington Post\" reported, \"Moniz emerged as the calm center of the proceedings, beginning his interjections with recitations of what he described as 'facts,' and mildly observing that Republican characterizations were 'incorrect.'\" Kerry, Lew, and Moniz faced \"uniform animus of Republicans\" at the hearing, with Republican senators giving \"long and often scathing speeches denouncing what they described as a fatally flawed agreement and accusing the administration of dangerous naivete\" and showing \"little interest in responses\" from the three cabinet secretaries. \"The Washington Post\" reported on twelve issues related to the agreement over which the two sides disagreed at the hearing.\n\nOn 28 July, Kerry, Moniz, and Lew testified before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Committee chairman Ed Royce, Republican of California, said in his opening statement, \"we are being asked to consider an agreement that gives Iran permanent sanctions relief for temporary nuclear restrictions.\" \"Royce also said the inspection regime 'came up short' from 'anywhere, anytime' access to Iran's nuclear facilities and criticized the removal of restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile program and conventional arms.\" The committee's ranking member, Representative Eliot Engel, Democrat of New York, said he has \"serious questions and concerns\" about the agreement. Kerry, Lew, and Moniz spent four hours testifying before the committee. At the hearing, Kerry stated that if Congress killed the deal, \"You'll not only be giving Iran a free pass to double the pace of its uranium enrichment, to build a heavy-water reactor, to install new and more efficient centrifuges, but they will do it all without the unprecedented inspection and transparency measures that we have secured. Everything that we have tried to prevent will now happen.\"\nOn 29 July, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Kerry, Moniz, and Lew appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee in a three-hour hearing. Carter and Dempsey had been invited to testify by Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the committee; Kerry, Moniz, and Lew attended the hearing at the invitation of the Pentagon. In his opening statement, McCain said that if this agreement failed and U.S. armed forces were called to take action against Iran, they \"could be at greater risk because of this agreement\". He also asserted that the agreement may lead American allies and partners to fateful decisions and result in \"growing regional security competition, new arms races, nuclear proliferation, and possibly conflict\". The committee's ranking Democratic member, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, said Congress had an obligation \"to independently validate that the agreement will meet our common goal of stopping Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon\" and stated, \"the agreement, no matter your position on it, is historic and, if implemented scrupulously, could serve as a strategic inflection point in the world's relations with Iran, for international non-proliferation efforts, and for the political and security dynamics in the Middle East.\"\n\nCarter said the agreement prevented Iran from \"getting a nuclear weapon in a comprehensive and verifiable way\". He assured the committee that the deal would not limit the U.S. ability to respond with military force if needed. In response to a question from McCain, Carter said he had \"no reason to foresee\" that the agreement would cause Iran's threatening behavior to change more broadly, stating \"That is why it's important that Iran not have a nuclear weapon.\" Dempsey offered what he described as a \"pragmatic\" view. He neither praised nor criticized the deal, but did testify that the agreement reduced the chances of a near-term military conflict between the United States and Iran. Dempsey said that the agreement works to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons, but does not address other concerns about Iran's malign activities in the region, ranging from \"ballistic missile technology to weapons trafficking, to ... malicious activity in cyberspace\". Dempsey testified, \"Ultimately, time and Iranian behavior will determine if the nuclear agreement is effective and sustainable\" and stated that he would continue to provide military options to the president. Senator Joni Ernst expressed disagreement with President Obama who stated that the choice was the Iran nuclear deal or war. When General Martin Dempsey testified that the United States had \"a range of options\" and he presented them to the president, Ernst said: \"it's imperative everybody on the panel understand that there are other options available.\"\n\nUnder the JCPOA, Iran must submit a full report on its nuclear history before it can receive any sanctions relief. The IAEA has confidential technical arrangements with many countries as a matter of standard operating procedure. \"Republican lawmakers refer to these agreements as 'secret side deals' and claim that the JCPOA hinges on a set of agreements no one in the administration has actually seen.\" Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a Republican opponent of the agreement, said that Kerry had \"acted like Pontius Pilate\" and \"washed his hands, kicked it to the IAEA, knowing Congress would not get this information unless someone went out to find it.\" On 30 July, Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas introduced a resolution seeking a delay in the review period, arguing, \"The 60-calendar day period for review of such agreement in the Senate cannot be considered to have begun until the Majority Leader certifies that all of the materials required to be transmitted under the definition of the term 'agreement' under such Act, including any side agreements with Iran and United States Government-issued guidance materials in relation to Iran, have been transmitted to the Majority Leader.\" On 5 August, Yukiya Amano, director general of the IAEA, spoke with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a closed briefing about two IAEA documents: an agreement on inspection protocols with Iran and an agreement with Iran regarding Iranian disclosure of its previous nuclear activity (known as Possible Military Dimensions). Following this briefing with Amano, Republican Senator Bob Corker, the committee chairman, told reporters: \"The majority of members here left with far more questions than they had before the meeting took place\" and \"We can not get him to even confirm that we will have physical access inside of Parchin.\" The committee's ranking Democratic member, Senator Benjamin Cardin told reporters: \"I thought today was helpful, but it was not a substitute for seeing the document.\"\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby responded, \"There's no secret deals between Iran and the IAEA that the P5+1 has not been briefed on in detail\" and stated \"These kinds of technical arrangements with the IAEA are a matter of standard practice, that they're not released publicly or to other states, but our experts are familiar and comfortable with the contents, which we would be happy to discuss with Congress in a classified setting.\" The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation writes that: \"The arrangement specifies procedural information regarding how the IAEA will conduct its investigation into Iran's past nuclear history, including mentioning the names of informants who will be interviewed. Releasing this information would place those informants, and the information they hold, at risk.\" Mark Hibbs of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Thomas Shea, a former IAEA safeguards official and former head of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Programs at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, wrote that the charges of a \"secret side deal\" made by opponents of the agreement were a \"manufactured controversy\". Hibbs and Shea noted: \"The IAEA has safeguards agreement with 180 countries. All have similar information protection provisions. Without these, governments would not open their nuclear programs for multilateral oversight. So IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano was acting by the book on August 5 when he told members of Congress that he couldn't share with them the details of [the] verification protocol the IAEA had negotiated with Iran as part of a bilateral 'roadmap.'\" David Albright, founder and president of the Institute for Science and International Security and a former IAEA nuclear inspector, stated that the demands for greater transparency regarding the agreement between Iran and IAEA \"aren't unreasonable\" and, \"Iran is a big screamer for more confidentiality. Nonetheless, if the IAEA wanted to make it more open, it could.\" Albright also proposed that the United States \"should clearly and publicly confirm, and Congress should support with legislation, that if Iran does not address the IAEA's concerns about the past military dimensions of its nuclear programs, U.S. sanctions will not be lifted\".\n\nRepublican leaders vowed to attempt to kill the agreement as soon as it was released, even before classified sections were made available to Congress, and \"Republican lawmakers raced to send out news releases criticizing it.\" According to \"The Washington Post\", \"most congressional Republicans remained deeply skeptical, some openly scornful, of the prospect of relieving economic sanctions while leaving any Iranian uranium-enrichment capability intact.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said the deal \"appears to fall well short of the goal we all thought was trying to be achieved, which was that Iran would not be a nuclear state\". A \"New York Times\" news analysis stated that Republican opposition to the agreement \"seems born of genuine distaste for the deal's details, inherent distrust of President Obama, intense loyalty to Israel and an expansive view of the role that sanctions have played beyond preventing Iran's nuclear abilities\". \"The Washington Post\" identified twelve issues related to the agreement on which the two sides disagreed, including the efficacy of inspections at undeclared sites; the effectiveness of the snapback sanctions; the significance of limits on enrichment; the significance of IAEA side agreements; the effectiveness of inspections of military sites; the consequences of walking away from an agreement; and the effects of lifting sanctions.\n\nOne area of disagreement between supporters and opponents of the JCPOA is the consequences of walking away from an agreement, and whether renegotiation of the agreement is a realistic option. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, an opponent of the agreement, called for the U.S. government to keep sanctions in place, strengthen them, and \"pursue the hard-trodden path of diplomacy once more, difficult as it may be\". Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said that he believed that it was \"hyperbole\" to say that the agreement was the only alternative to war. President Obama, by contrast, argued that renegotiation of the deal is unrealistic, stating in his American University speech, \"the notion that there is a better deal to be had. ... relies on vague promises of toughness\" and stated, \"Those making this argument are either ignorant of Iranian society, or they are not being straight with the American people. ... Neither the Iranian government, or the Iranian opposition, or the Iranian people would agree to what they would view as a total surrender of their sovereignty.\" Obama also argued, \"those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy. Instead of strengthening our position, as some have suggested, Congress' rejection would almost certainly result in multi-lateral sanctions unraveling,\" because \"our closest allies in Europe or in Asia, much less China or Russia, certainly are not going to enforce existing sanctions for another five, 10, 15 years according to the dictates of the U.S. Congress because their willingness to support sanctions in the first place was based on Iran ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons. It was not based on the belief that Iran cannot have peaceful nuclear power.\" Secretary of State Kerry has echoed these remarks, saying in July 2015 that the idea of a \"'better deal,' some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Iran's complete capitulation . ... is a fantasy, plain and simple, and our intelligence community will tell you that\". Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, a supporter of the agreement wrote: \"Some say that, should the Senate reject this agreement, we would be in position to negotiate a \"better\" one. But I've spoken to representatives of the five nations that helped broker the deal, and they agree that this simply wouldn't be the case.\"\n\nOn 28 July 2015, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, the longest-serving Jewish member now in Congress, announced in a lengthy statement that he would support the JCPOA, saying, \"the agreement is the best way\" to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and that a rejection of the agreement would lead the international sanctions regime to \"quickly fall apart\", as \"sanctions likely would not be continued even by our closest allies, and the United States would be isolated trying to enforce our unilateral sanctions as to Iran's banking and oil sectors.\"\n\nA key figure in the congressional review process is Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, a Democrat who is the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Cardin took a phone call from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu opposing the agreement and participated in a private 90-minute session with Energy Secretary Moniz supporting the agreement. On 21 July, Cardin said that if the agreement is implemented, the United States should increase military aid to Israel and friendly Gulf states.\n\nOn 4 August 2015, three key and closely watched Senate Democrats—Tim Kaine of Virginia (a Foreign Relations Committee member), Barbara Boxer of California (also a Foreign Relations Committee member), and Bill Nelson of Florida—announced their support for the agreement. In a floor speech that day, Kaine said that the agreement is \"far preferable to any other alternative, including war\" and, \"America has honored its best traditions and shown that patient diplomacy can achieve what isolation and hostility cannot.\" In a similar floor speech the same day, Nelson said that: \"I am convinced [that the agreement] will stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon for at least the next 10 to 15 years. No other available alternative accomplishes this vital objective\" and \"If the U.S. walks away from this multinational agreement, I believe we would find ourselves alone in the world with little credibility.\" Conversely, another closely watched senator, Chuck Schumer of New York, who is expected to make a bid to become Senate Democratic leader, announced his opposition to the agreement on 6 August, writing, \"there is a strong case that we are better off without an agreement than with one\"\n\nAccording to an Associated Press report, the classified assessment of the United States Intelligence Community on the agreement concludes that because Iran will be required by the agreement to provide international inspectors with \"unprecedented volume of information about nearly every aspect of its existing nuclear program\", Iran's ability to conceal a covert weapons program will be diminished. In a 13 August letter to colleagues, ten current and former Democratic members of the House Select Committee on Intelligence (including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff) referred to this assessment as a reason to support the agreement, writing, \"We are confident that this monitoring and the highly intrusive inspections provided for in the agreement—along with our own intelligence capabilities—make it nearly impossible for Iran to develop a covert enrichment effort without detection.\" The ten members also wrote \"You need not take our word for it\" and referred members to the classified assessment itself, which is located in an office in the Capitol basement and is available for members of Congress to read.\n\nA resolution of disapproval was initially expected to pass both the House and Senate, meaning, \"the real challenge for the White House is whether they can marshal enough Democrats to sustain the veto.\" Two-thirds of both houses (the House of Representatives and the Senate) are required to override a veto, meaning that one-third of either house (146 votes in the House, or 34 in the Senate) could sustain (uphold) President Obama's veto of a resolution of disapproval.\n\nBy early September 2015, 34 Senators had publicly confirmed support for the deal, a crucial threshold because it ensured that the Senate could sustain (i.e., uphold) any veto of a resolution of disapproval. Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland announced support on 2 September, a day after Chris Coons of Delaware and Bob Casey, Jr. of Pennsylvania also announced support, reaching 34 votes and assuring that an eventual disapproval resolution passed in the Senate could not override an Obama veto. By the following day, 38 Democratic senators supported the deal, 3 were opposed, and 5 were still undecided.\n\nBy 8 September, all senators had made a commitment on the agreement, with 42 in support (40 Democrats and two independents) and 58 opposed (54 Republicans and four Democrats). It is possible for senators in support of the agreement to kill the disapproval resolution outright in the Senate by effectively filibustering it, making it unnecessary for Obama to veto a disapproval resolution at all. However, this is only possible if at least 41 vote to do so, and several senators in support of the agreement, including Coons, \"have suggested they'd prefer an up-or-down vote on the deal instead of blocking it altogether\".\n\nThe apparent success of a strategy to marshal congressional support for the deal, linked to a carefully orchestrated rollout of endorsements (although Democratic Senate Whip Dick Durbin and other officials disputed the suggestion of coordination) was attributed to lessons learned by the White House and congressional Democrats during struggles in previous summers with Republicans, in particular, over Obama's health care legislation. An August 2015 meeting at which top diplomats from the UK, Russia, China, Germany, and France told 10 undecided Democratic senators they had no intention of returning to the negotiating table was reported to be particularly crucial. Senator Coons said: \"They were clear and strong that we will not join you in re-imposing sanctions.\"\n\nOn 20 August 2015, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that House Democrats had the votes to uphold a veto of a resolution of disapproval. To sustain a veto, Pelosi would need to hold only 146 of the 188 House Democrats; by 20 August, about 60 House Democrats have publicly declared their support for the final agreement, and about 12 had publicly declared their opposition. In May 2015, before the final agreement was announced, 151 House Democrats signed in support for the broad outlines in the April framework agreement; none of those signatories have announced opposition to the final agreement.\n\nIt was originally expected that the House would vote on a formal resolution of disapproval introduced by Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. As the Senate moved toward a vote on a resolution of disapproval, House leadership (under Republican control) planned to vote on a similar resolution of disapproval. However, conservative Republicans \"revolted in protest\" as \"the chamber's right flank wanted tougher action from its leader\" and the House Republican leadership (under Speaker John Boehner) planned to vote instead chose to bring a resolution of approval to the floor \"as a way to effectively force Democrats who had voiced support for the president to formally register such endorsement\". On 11 September 2015, the resolution failed, as expected, on a 162-269 vote; 244 Republicans and 25 Democrats voted no, while 162 Democrats and no Republicans voted yes. On the same day, House Republicans held two additional votes, one on a resolution claiming that the Obama administration had failed to meet the requirements of a congressional review period on the deal and another resolution which would prevent the United States from lifting any sanctions. The former resolution passed on a party-line vote, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed; the latter resolution passed on nearly a party-line vote, with all Republicans and two Democrats in favor and every other Democrat opposed. The House action against the resolution was a \"symbolic vote that will have no consequence for the implementation of the deal\", and the two anti-agreement measures passed by the House were seen as \"unlikely to even reach Obama's desk\".\n\nOn 10 September, the day before the vote, House speaker Boehner threatened to \"use every tool at our disposal to stop, slow and delay this agreement from being fully implemented\" and said that a lawsuit by House Republicans against the president (claiming that the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act was not followed) was \"an option that is very possible\". Four months later, however, House Republicans abandoned their plans for a lawsuit against the administration over the JCPOA.\n\nConservative legal activist Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit against President Obama and members of Congress in July 2015 in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, asserting that the agreement should be considered a treaty requiring Senate ratification. Klayman's suit was dismissed for lack of standing in September 2015.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Khamenei issued a letter of guidelines to President Rouhani, ordering him on how to proceed with the deal. On 21 June 2015, the Iranian Parliament (Majlis) decided to form a committee to study the JCPOA and to wait at least 80 days before voting on it. Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Atomic Energy Organization of Iran chief Ali Akbar Salehi, defended the deal in Parliament on the same day. Although the Iranian constitution gives Parliament the right to cancel the deal, it was reported that this outcome is unlikely. \"The New York Times\" reported, \"the legislators have effectively opted to withhold their judgment until they know whether the American Congress approves of the deal.\"\n\nIn televised remarks made on 23 July 2015, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani rejected domestic criticism of the JCPOA from Iranian hardliners, \"such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its allies\", which \"have criticized the accord as an invasive affront to the country's sovereignty and a capitulation to foreign adversaries, particularly the United States\". In remarks described by \"The New York Times \"as \"blunt\" and uncharacteristically frank, Rouhani claimed a popular mandate to make an agreement based on his election in 2013 and warned that the alternative was \"an economic Stone Age\" brought on by sanctions which (as the \"Times\" described) have \"shriveled oil exports and denied the country access to the global banking system\". On 26 July, a two-page, top-secret directive sent to Iranian newspaper editors from Iran's Supreme National Security Council surfaced online. In the document, newspapers are instructed to avoid criticism of the agreement and to avoid giving the impression of \"a rift\" at the highest levels of government. The BBC reported that the document appears to be aimed at constraining criticism of the JCPOA by Iranian hardliners.\n\nOn 3 September, Iranian supreme leader Khamenei said that the Majlis should make the final decision on the agreement. On the same day, Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament, said that he support the agreement and that: \"The agreement needs to be discussed and needs to be approved by the Iranian parliament. There will be heated discussions and debates.\"\n\nAbbas Milani and Michael McFaul wrote: \"those [in Iran] supporting the deal include moderates inside the government, many opposition leaders, a majority of Iranian citizens, and many in the Iranian American diaspora—a disparate group that has rarely agreed on anything until now.\" Within the government, Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who negotiated the agreement, \"are now the most vocal in defending it against Iranian hawks\". Also vocally supporting the agreement are former presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami and moderates within parliament. The agreement is also supported by most prominent opposition leaders, including Mir-Hossein Mousavi, a 2009 presidential candidate who is under house arrest for his role as a leader of the Green Movement.\n\nConversely, \"the most militantly authoritarian, conservative, and anti-Western leaders and groups within Iran oppose the deal.\" The anti-agreement coalition in Iran includes former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, former head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Fereydoon Abbasi, ex-nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili; and various conservative clerics and Revolutionary Guard commanders. This group has \"issued blistering attacks on the incompetence of Iran's negotiating team, claiming that negotiators caved on many key issues and were outmaneuvered by more clever and sinister American diplomats\".\n\nIranian defense minister Hossein Dehqan said on 2 September that Iran would not allow the IAEA to visit every site or facility that it wishes.\n\nThe Majlis special commission for examining the JCPOA, has invited Ali Shamkhani, as well as members of former nuclear negotiation team including Ali Bagheri and Fereydoon Abbasi to comment on the deal. During the session, Saeed Jalili, ex-chief negotiator has slammed the deal, stating \"approximately 100 absolute rights\" of Iran were conceded to the opposing side. He believes the deal is \"unacceptable\" because Iran makes an \"exceptional [nuclear case], replacing 'permission' with 'right' under the NPT, and accepting unconventional measures\". He also believes that the deal has crossed the red lines drawn by the Supreme leader of Iran. His testimony was criticized by commission members Masoud Pezeshkian and Abbas Ali Mansouri Arani. In another session, current negotiatiors Abbas Araqchi and Majid Takht-Ravanchi defended the deal, led by Javad Zarif.\n\nIn the Iranian media, the leading reformist newspapers, \"Etemad\" and \"Shargh\", \"continue to write approvingly of the negotiations and their outcome\". Conversely, the leading conservative paper \"Ettelaat\" has criticized the agreement. The most \"bombastic and hard-line criticism of the deal\" has come from \"Kayhan\", which is edited by Hossein Shariatmadari and closely associated with Khamenei, the supreme leader.\n\nThe agreement is supported by many Iranian dissidents, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate, human rights activist, and Iranian exile Shirin Ebadi, who \"labeled as 'extremists' those who opposed the agreement in Iran and America\". Likewise, dissident journalist and former political prisoner Akbar Ganji expressed hope, \"step-by-step nuclear accords, the lifting of economic sanctions and the improvement of the relations between Iran and Western powers will gradually remove the warlike and securitized environment from Iran.\" Citing Iran's human rights situation and the \"lack of religious and political freedom in the country\", some dissidents opposed the agreement, including Ahmad Batebi, Nazanin Afshin-Jam, and Roozbeh Farahanipour, who signed an open letter arguing, \"more pressure should be applied to the regime, not less.\"\n\nOn 13 October, \"The New York Times\" and many other major U.S. news sources reported that the Iranian Parliament had approved the JPCOA by a vote of 161 votes in favor, 59 against and 13 abstentions. Major Iranian news sources including Fars News Agency and Press TV, referred to as a semi-official government source by U.S. media, reported that what was actually approved was a document consisting of the text of the JPCOA, supplemented by text unilaterally added by Iran and not agreed by the P5+1.\n\nOn 18 October 2015, EU High Representative Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif jointly announced \"Adoption Day\" for the JCPOA, noting actions taken and planned by the EU, Iran, the IAEA, and the United States, and stating, \"All sides remain strongly committed to ensuring that implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action can start as soon as possible.\"\n\nAfter the IAEA confirmed that Iran met the relevant requirements under the JCPOA, all nuclear sanctions were lifted by the UN, the EU and the United States on 16 January 2016.\n\nWashington imposed new sanctions on 11 companies and individuals for supplying Iran's ballistic missile program on the first day of the implementation. According to Kerry, $1.7 billion in debt with interest is to be paid to Tehran. However, some Iranian financial institutions including Ansar Bank, Bank Saderat, Bank Saderat PLC, and Mehr Bank remain on the SDN List and a number of U.S. sanctions with respect to Iran including existing terrorism, human rights and ballistic missiles-related sanctions will remain in place.\n\nSome argue that deterrence is the key to ensuring not just that Iran is in compliance with the agreement but also to preventing them from developing nuclear weapons. Former Assistant Secretary for Nonproliferation Robert Einhorn, a supporter of the agreement, wrote it would be better to have permanent or longer-term restrictions on Iran's enrichment program, but preventing a nuclear-armed Iran is possible, \"provided the United States and key partners maintain a strong and credible deterrent against a future Iranian decision to go for the bomb\". According to Michael Eisenstadt, Director of the Military and Security Studies Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, \"deterring Iran from developing or acquiring nuclear weapons will remain the core imperative driving U.S. policy in the coming years\".\n\nFour days after the JCPOA was adopted, Khamenei delivered a speech, highlighting his fatwa and rejecting the claim that the nuclear talks rather than Iran's religious abstinence prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He said:\n\nIn a letter addressed to Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, President Barack Obama raised the issue about U.S. ability to deter Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons:\n\nAmbassador Dennis Ross, former top Mideast official, and General David Petraeus, former CIA director, wrote in a \"Washington Post\" op-ed, \"Bolstering deterrence is essential in addressing key vulnerabilities\" of the agreement. Petraeus and Ross asserted that if Iran decide to race toward a nuclear weapon \"there is a need not to speak of our options but of our readiness to use force\", since the threat of force is far more likely to deter the Iranians. They said the president could resolve their concerns by stating that he would use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, including producing highly enriched uranium, even after the deal ends in 15 years. It is \"critically important for the president to state this clearly, particularly given his perceived hesitancy to use force\", they said.\n\nIn the same letter, Obama detailed the possible non-military unilateral and multilateral responses to be employed should Iran violate the agreement, however, the president made it clear: \"Ultimately, it is essential that we retain the flexibility to decide what responsive measures we and our allies deem appropriate for any non-compliance.\" Flexibility meant that Obama rejected specifying \"the penalties for smaller violations of the accord\" in advance.\n\nThe open letter, which was signed by more than 100 former U.S. ambassadors and high-ranking State Department officials endorsing the agreement, begins with the words: \"The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran stands as a landmark agreement in deterring the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\" In contrast, Michael Mandelbaum, the Christian A. Herter Professor at the Johns Hopkins University, School of Advanced International Studies, wrote that nuclear nonproliferation in the Middle East ultimately depended \"not on the details of the Vienna agreement but on the familiar Cold-War policy of deterrence\". Mandelbaum added that if President Obama will leave office without Iran building the bomb, \"the responsibility for conducting a policy of effective deterrence will fall on his successor.\" Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz expressed his view on deterring Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons as follows: \"Nothing currently on the table will deter Iran. Sanctions are paper protests to an oil-rich nation. Diplomacy has already failed because Russia and China are playing both sides.\"\n\nWith the prospective lifting of some sanctions, the agreement was expected to have a significant impact on both the economy of Iran and global markets. The energy sector is particularly important, with Iran having nearly 10 percent of global oil reserves and 18 percent of natural gas reserves. Millions of barrels of Iranian oil might come onto global markets, lowering the price of crude oil. However, the impact would not be immediate, because Iran would not be able to implement measures that are needed to lift sanctions until the end of 2015. Technology and investment from global integrated oil companies were expected to increase capacity from Iran's oil fields and refineries, which have been in \"disarray\" in recent years, plagued by mismanagement and underinvestment. Senior executives from oil giants Royal Dutch Shell, Total S.A, and Eni met with the Iranian oil minister in Vienna in June, the month before the JCPOA was announced, and sought business opportunities in Iran.\n\nThe economic impact of a partial lifting of sanctions extends beyond the energy sector; \"The New York Times\" reported that \"consumer-oriented companies, in particular, could find opportunity in this country with 81 million consumers,\" many of whom are young and prefer Western products. Iran is \"considered a strong emerging market play\" by investment and trading firms.\n\nFrench auto manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroën was one of the first Western companies to re-establish commercial ties following the deal.\n\nIn February 2016, after the end of a four year restriction, Iranian banks—except Mehr, Ansar and Saderat banks— reconnected to the SWIFT. However, many Iranian observers including critics of Rouhani's administration, economists and private sector representatives claimed the news was false. According to \"Financial Times\"s report, Iran's banks are indeed being reconnected to SWIFT but there have been \"too few\" transactions because european and US banks are \"worried about the risks\" of dealing with them and \"scarred by a string of multibillion-dollar fines\".\n\nThree months after implementation, Iran was unable to tap about $100 billion held abroad. One 15 April 2016, Central Bank of Iran Governor Valiollah Seif said in an interview with Bloomberg Television that Iran has gotten \"almost nothing\" from the accord. He also met Secretary of Treasury Jack Lew on the sidelines of his Washington's trip to discuss the concerns. Josh Earnest, the White House Press Secretary, said that \"the agreement that's included in the JCPOA does not include giving Iran access to the US financial system or to allow the execution of so-called U-turn transactions.\"\n\nOn 20 April 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States decided on \"Bank Markazi v. Peterson\" and ruled that almost $2 billion of Iranian frozen assets must be given to families of people killed in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. The court accused Iran of being responsible for the incident. Iranian foreign minister Zarif called the ruling \"highway robbery\", lashing the court for its previous ruling of holding Iran responsible for 9/11, adding that the Supreme Court is \"the Supreme Court of the United States, not the Supreme Court of the world. We're not under its jurisdiction, nor is our money.\"\n\nOn 27 November 2016, Schlumberger, the largest oil service company in the world, announced that it had signed a preliminary deal to study an Iranian oil field. According to Schlumberger's spokesperson, this was a memorandum of understanding with the state-run National Iranian Oil Company \"for the non-disclosure of data required for a technical evaluation of a field development prospect\".\n\nIn July 2015, Richard Stone wrote in the journal \"Science\" in July 2015 that if the agreement is fully implemented, \"Iran can expect a rapid expansion of scientific cooperation with Western powers. As its nuclear facilities are repurposed, scientists from Iran and abroad will team up in areas such as nuclear fusion, astrophysics, and radioisotopes for cancer therapy.\"\n\nIn August 2015, the British embassy in Tehran reopened almost four years after it was closed after protesters attacked the embassy in 2011. At a reopening ceremony, Hammond said that since Rouhani's election as president, British-Iranian relations had gone from a \"low point\" to steady \"step-by-step\" improvement. Hammond said: \"Last month's historic nuclear agreement was another milestone, and showed the power of diplomacy, conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect, to solve shared challenges. Re-opening the embassy is the logical next step to build confidence and trust between two great nations.\" The BBC's diplomatic correspondent, Jonathan Marcus, reported that the nuclear agreement \"had clearly been decisive in prompting the UK embassy to be reopened\", stating that British-Iranian \"ties have slowly been warming but it is clearly the successful conclusion of the nuclear accord with Iran that has paved the way for the embassy reopening\".\n\nIn May 2018, \"The Observer\" revealed that the White House had hired an Israeli intelligence firm in May 2017 to search for unsavory information on Obama administration officials Ben Rhodes and Colin Kahl. Former UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said that these efforts by Trump and Netanyahu appear to have been intended \"not so much to discredit the [Iran] deal but to undermine those around it.\"\n\nAfter the adoption of the JCPOA, the United States imposed several new non-nuclear sanctions against Iran, some of which were condemned by Iran as possible violations of the deal. According to Seyed Mohammad Marandi, professor at the University of Tehran, the general consensus in Iran while the negotiations were taking place was that the United States would move towards increasing sanctions on non-nuclear areas. He said that these post-JCPOA sanctions could \"severely damage the chances for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action bearing fruit\".\n\nOn 8 and 9 March 2016, the IRGC conducted ballistic missile tests as part of its military drills, with one of the Qadr H missiles carrying the inscription, \"Israel should be wiped off the Earth.\" Israel called on Western powers to punish Iran for the tests, which U.S. officials said do not violate the nuclear deal, but may violate United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted that the tests were not in violation of the UNSC resolution. On 17 March, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Iranian and British companies for involvement in the Iranian ballistic missile program.\n\nOn 21 May 2016, Zarif, the foreign minister of Iran, persisted that \"U.S. must take practical steps\" in the meeting with his New Zealander counterpart Murray McCully.\nHours before the official announcement of the activation of JCPOA on 16 January 2016, Iran released four imprisoned Iranian Americans—\"Washington Post\" reporter Jason Rezaian, who had been convicted of espionage, former Marine Corps infantryman Amir Hekmati, who had been convicted of co-operating with hostile governments, Christian pastor Saeed Abedini, who was convicted on national security charges, and former Iranian infantryman Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, who was convicted of violating alcohol prohibitions and awaiting trial on espionage charges—in exchange for the United States' release of seven Iranian Americans—Bahram Mechanic, Khosrow Afghahi and Tooraj Faridi, charged with sanctions violations, Nader Modanlo, convicted of helping launch Iranian satellite Sina-1, Arash Ghahreman, convicted of money laundering and sanctions violations for exporting navigation equipment to Iran, Nima Golestaneh, convicted of hacking, and Ali Saboonchi, convicted of sanctions violations—and the dismissal of outstanding charges against 14 Iranians outside the United States. A fifth American, student and researcher Matthew Trevithick, left Iran in a separate arrangement.\n\nAs part of the exchange, the U.S. government dropped charges and Interpol red notices against \"14 Iranians for whom it was assessed that extradition requests were unlikely to be successful.\" Senior U.S. officials defended the agreement as a good deal for the U.S., but some Justice Department officials and FBI and DHS agents were critical because this disrupted the National Counterproliferation Initiative efforts \"to lure top Iranian targets into traveling internationally in order to arrest them\".\n\nShahi Hamid of \"The Atlantic\" wrote that the agreement \"had a narrow—if understandable—focus on the minutia of Iran's nuclear program\", and \"[t]he Obama administration repeatedly underscored that the negotiations weren't about Iran's other activities in the region: They were about the nuclear program.\" The U.S. government and observers noted from the time that the framework was entered into in April 2015 \"that the United States and Iran still find themselves on opposite sides of most of the conflicts that have pitched the Arab world into chaos\" and that the agreement was \"unlikely\" to cause Iran to become a firm partner of the West.\n\nThe narrow nuclear non-proliferation focus of the deal was criticized by the agreement's opponents (such as Lawrence J. Hass of the American Foreign Policy Council), who argued that the agreement was faulty because it did not address anti-Semitism and threats against Israel, hostility and rhetoric against America and the West in general, illegal missile testing, supplying of arms to terrorist groups, and efforts to destabilize ongoing conflicts in Syria and Yemen.\n\nIn October 2015 \"The Wall Street Journal\" noted that Iran had recently carried out ballistic missile tests, announced the conviction of \"Washington Post\" journalist Jason Rezaian, launched military operations to maintain Bashar al-Assad's administration in Syria, and continued shipping arms and money to Houthi rebels in Yemen, the latter two actions fueling fears of a broader regional war.\n\nIsrael and Saudi Arabia expressed concern about Iran's ability to use diplomatic cover and unfrozen money from the deal to strengthen its regional position and that of its allies. Critics in Washington accused the Obama administration of having been duped by Iran and Russia into accepting a deal that was antithetical to American interests.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration was also accused of whitewashing Iran's failure to cooperate fully with the IAEA investigation into the possible military dimensions of its past nuclear work.\n\nIn November 2015, \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"[a]nyone who hoped that Iran's nuclear agreement with the United States and other powers portended a new era of openness with the West has been jolted with a series of increasingly rude awakenings over the past few weeks.\" The \"Times\" reported, variously, that the Iranian government had invited a Lebanese-American to visit the country, and then arrested him for spying; the Ayatollah made a public statement that the slogan \"Death to America\" was \"eternal\"; a wave of anti-American billboards went up in the capital; a backlash by political hard-liners began and the Revolutionary Guard intelligence apparatus \"started rounding up journalists, activists and cultural figures\"; state media circulated conspiracy theories about the United States, including that the CIA had downed a Russian civilian passenger jet in Egypt; Iranian and Lebanese citizens in Iran holding dual American citizenship were targeted for arrest on charges of \"spying\"; clothing manufacturers were prohibited from selling items featuring the American or British flags; and a state-sponsored demonstration was held outside the former U.S. embassy in Tehran on the anniversary of the takeover and hostage crisis in 1979.\n\n\"Business Insider\" reported that a variety of factors made it more likely that Iran's stance would harden once the agreement was in place, with one Iran expert saying that Iran's \"nice, smiling face\" would now disappear as the country pursued more adversarial stances, and policy analysts saying that by negotiating the deal with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, Obama had \"made an investment in the stability of the [IRGC] regime\".\n\nThe \"National Review\" wrote that the U.S. administration's unwillingness to acknowledge any Iranian noncompliance had left the Iranians in control, and that the deal was undermining international security by emboldening Iran to act as a regional hegemon, at the expense of U.S. influence and credibility.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page editor Paul Gigot argued in February 2016 that Iran's prohibited missile tests, capture of U.S. naval personnel, and other provocations were a sign that rapprochement hoped for by Iran's Western negotiating partners was not going to happen, saying the government had no interest in accommodating U.S. interests, seeking instead to humiliate the United States and spread propaganda.\nJames S. Robbins, an American political commentator and a senior fellow on the American Foreign Policy Council, criticized the nuclear deal as \"impotent\" because it does not limit Iran's ballistic missile program, and UNSC Resolution 2231, which was adopted along with the deal, weakened the limits Iran's ballistic missile program that had been imposed by previous UNSC resolutions.\n\nOn 4 March 2016, Olli Heinonen, former Deputy Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote \"the International Atomic Energy Agency's most recent report on Iran's nuclear activities provides insufficient details on important verification and monitoring issues,\" and said that the report's lack of detailed data prevented the international community from verifying whether Iran was complying with the deal.\n\nOn 20 March 2017, the Trump administration formally certified that Iran was in compliance with JCPOA, but added that the country will be subject to non-nuclear, terrorism related, sanctions. The Trump administration refused to recertify Iran's compliance in October 2017, however, citing multiple violations.\n\nOn 9 November 2016 Deutsche Welle, citing an alleged source from the IAEA, reported that \"Iran has violated the terms of its nuclear deal.\"\n\nOn 1 December 2016, the U.S. Senate voted to renew the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) for another decade. The Obama Administration and outside experts said the extension would have no practical effect and risked antagonizing Iran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, President Rouhani, and Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the extension of sanctions would be a breach of the nuclear deal. Some Iranian officials said that Iran might ramp up uranium enrichment in response. In January 2017, representatives from Iran, P5+1 and EU gathered in Vienna's Palais Coburg hotel to address Iran's complaint about the US congressional bill.\n\nThe Trump administration said that Trump personally lobbied dozens of European officials against doing business with Iran during the May 2017 Brussels summit; this likely violated the terms of the JCPOA, which expressly states that the U.S. may not pursue \"any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran\". The Trump administration certified in July 2017 that Iran had upheld its end of the agreement. In October 2017, however, the Trump administration refused to recertify Iran's compliance with the deal, saying that \"Iran has violated the agreement multiple times.\" \n\nThe IAEA, EU, Russia and China have all affirmed that Iran is respecting the limitations on its nuclear program. The IAEA, the foremost authority on the matter, has repeatedly deemed Iran in compliance with the nuclear deal. The U.S. State Department has also certified that Iran is holding up its end of the bargain, and a host of experts affirmed these findings. IAEA Director General Amano said that \"Iran is subject to the world's most robust nuclear verification regime.\"\nAccording to David Makovsky, a Middle East scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Iran was not in compliance, because under the terms of the deal, Iran was supposed to reveal all of its research into nuclear weapons, and that based on evidence presented by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on April 30, 2018, \"it seems clear that they did not.\"\n\nAli Khamenei banned allowing international inspectors into military sites. Trump and his administration said that Iranian military facilities could be used for nuclear-related activities barred under the agreement. Iran rejected Trump's request to allow inspection of Iran's military sites. However, Amano insisted that IAEA inspectors were entitled to inspect military sites under the agreement, although the IAEA has avoided requesting access to any military sites since the deal went into effect.\n\nIn a letter sent to then U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, the U.S. State Department said that the JCPOA \"is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document\".\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, different definitions for 'treaty' are used in international law and in domestic U.S. law. Under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties \"The term \"treaty\" has a broader meaning under international law than under domestic law. Under international law, \"treaty\" refers to any binding international agreement. Vienna Convention, art. 1(a). Under domestic law, \"treaty\" signifies only those binding international agreements that have received the advice and consent of the Senate.\"\n\nOn 13 October 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he would not make the certification required under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, accusing Iran of violating the \"spirit\" of the deal and calling on the U.S. Congress and international partners to \"address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons\".\n\nDeclaring that he would not decide to certify the deal, President Trump left it to Congress whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran and \"blow up\" the deal. However, Trump's aides sought to enact rules indicating how the United States could \"reimpose sanctions\" and the president listed three items which could provide such a \"trigger\" for leaving the deal: Iran's intercontinental ballistic missile, Iranian rejection of \"an extension of the deal's existing constraint on its nuclear activities\", and \"evidence that Iran could manufacture a bomb in less than 12 months\". Trump described the deal as \"one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into\".\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani stated that getting out from the Iran nuclear deal would \"carry a high cost\" for the United States. Also he said that no president was allowed to \"single-handedly revoke\" the deal signed by the UN.\n\nAfter Trump said that he \"cannot and will not\" recertify the nuclear deal with Iran, Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel supported the deal in a joint statement. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Mogherini said that the agreement was working well and that no one country could break the deal concluded by Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union. She suggested a \"collective process\" for keeping the deal. Russia's foreign minister confirmed that Iran was abiding by the nuclear deal.\n\nOn May 8, 2018, the United States officially withdrew from the agreement after President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum ordering the reinstatement of harsher sanctions. In his May 8 speech, Trump called the Iran deal \"horrible\" and said the United States would \"work with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution\" to prevent Iran from developing nuclear arms. The IAEA has continued to assess that Iran has been in compliance with JCPOA and that it had \"no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009\" Other parties to the deal stated that they will work to preserve the deal even after the US withdrawal.\n\nThe Iranian currency dropped significantly right after Trump announced the US withdrawal. The leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stated: \"I said from the first day: don't trust America\". The American flag was set on fire in Iran's Parliament. The next evening, May 9, according to IDF sources, Iranian Revolutionary Guard Quds Forces based in Syria launched rockets at Israeli military targets. Reporters for CNN said that, \"if confirmed,\" it appears to be \"the first time Iranian forces have fired rockets directly at Israeli forces.\"\n\nFollowing the U.S. withdrawal from JCPOA, Iran supreme leader Ali Khamenei presented 7 conditions for Europe to meet its commitments. Among these conditions, he said European powers must set up steps to preserve business relations with Iranian banks and purchase Iranian oil despite U.S. pressure. He also said there was no need to hold new discussions about Iran's ballistic missile program and regional activities.\n\n\n\n"}

On advice of counsel, Quaker Oats set up and transferred the land to the Great Klondike Big Inch Land Company to make the company the registered owner and manager of the deeds.\n\nStarting on January 1955, 93 newspapers across the United States ran advertisements that read \"Get a real deed to one square inch of land in the Yukon gold rush country\" and, \"You'll actually own one square inch of Yukon land\". The promotion was tied to the \"Sergeant Preston of the Yukon\" radio show which Quaker Oats was sponsoring at the time.\n\nThe promotion instructed people to mail a form along with a box top from either Quaker Puffed Wheat, Quaker Puffed Rice or Muffets Shredded Wheat to the Quaker Oats company. In turn, a 5 by 8 inch deed to one square inch of land in the Klondike was sent back. In February 1955, Quaker Oats was blocked from trading the deed for a box top by the Ohio Securities Division until it received a state license for the \"sale\" of foreign land. To get around the injunction, the company stopped the trade-in offer and instead put one of the deeds in each box of cereal produced.\n\nSince none of the deeds were actually registered, the documents were never legally binding and owners of these deeds were never actual owners of any land. The deed excluded mineral rights on the property.\n\nDue to $37.20 in back taxes, the land was repossessed by the Canadian government in 1965, and the Great Klondike Big Inch Land Company dissolved in 1966. The land is now part of the Dawson City Golf Course.\n\nTo this day, Yukon officials receive letters and phone calls about the deeds. The land office of the Yukon currently contains an 18-inch thick file folder of correspondence regarding the promotion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "621451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=621451", "title": "Lady Lever Art Gallery", "text": "Lady Lever Art Gallery\n\nThe Lady Lever Art Gallery is a museum founded and built by the industrialist and philanthropist William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme and opened in 1922. The Lady Lever Art Gallery is set in the garden village of Port Sunlight, on the Wirral and one of the National Museums Liverpool.\n\nThe museum is a significant surviving example of late Victorian and Edwardian taste. It houses major collections of fine and decorative art that are an expression of Lord Leverhulme’s personal taste and collecting interests. The collection is strong in British 19th-century painting and sculpture, spilling over to include late 18th-century and early 20th works. There are important collections of English furniture, Wedgwood, especially jasperware, and Chinese ceramics, and smaller groups of other types of objects, such as Ancient Greek vases and Roman sculpture. The majority of objects were part of the original donation, but the collection has continued to expand at a modest rate. The museum displays mostly mixed paintings, sculpture and furniture together, and there are five \"Period Rooms\" recreating typical period interiors from large houses.\n\nLever began collecting art in the late 19th century, largely to use in advertising for the popular Sunlight Soap brand (manufactured a few minutes' walk from the gallery) that helped to create his fortune. As he grew richer his collections began to expand, his confidence grew as well and he developed a taste for collecting. He mostly collected British art, but he was also fascinated by Chinese art, Roman sculpture and Greek vases, which he had chosen to collect to show styles that had influenced British artists in the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries.\n\nIn 2015 part of the museum was closed for building works, with little of the ceramics collections on display, but most of the other collections. A touring exhibition visited museums in Japan and elsewhere. The redeveloped South End galleries were restored to their original architecture style as part of a £2.8 million restoration project in 2016. The work included opening up original doorways to increase the circulation of visitors, improving the lighting and restoring some of the original vaulted ceilings.\n\nThe Gallery has good representation of several trends in Victorian painting, including the Pre-Raphaelites, both during the period of the Brotherhood and in their subsequent careers. Concern with social conditions, classical revivalism and later historical painting are all represented. There are important works by Millais, Ford Madox Brown, William Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Lord Leighton, and many others. The museum has what appears to be the largest display in any museum of paintings by William Etty. Earlier works include those by Turner, Constable, Gainsborough and Reynolds.\n\nMuch of the Wedgwood collection was from the collection of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth, bought in 1905. This in turn was partly formed from the collection of Charles Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood's grandson. It is probably the best collection of jasperware in the world.\n\nThe collection includes:\n\nCommissioned in 1913 from architects William and Segar Owen, the \"Lady Lever Art Gallery\" was built in the Beaux-Arts style. The building was opened in 1922 by Princess Beatrice, the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "400821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=400821", "title": "List of states with nuclear weapons", "text": "List of states with nuclear weapons\n\nThere are eight sovereign states that have successfully detonated nuclear weapons. Five are considered to be nuclear-weapon states (NWS) under the terms of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). In order of acquisition of nuclear weapons these are: the United States, Russia (the successor state to the Soviet Union), the United Kingdom, France, and China.\n\nSince the NPT entered into force in 1970, three states that were not parties to the Treaty have conducted nuclear tests, namely India, Pakistan, and North Korea. North Korea had been a party to the NPT but withdrew in 2003.\n\nIsrael is also generally understood to have nuclear weapons, but does not acknowledge it, maintaining a policy of deliberate ambiguity, and is not known definitively to have conducted a nuclear test. Israel is estimated to possess somewhere between 75 and 400 nuclear warheads. One possible motivation for \"nuclear ambiguity\" is deterrence with minimum political cost.\n\nStates that formerly possessed nuclear weapons are South Africa (developed nuclear weapons but then disassembled its arsenal before joining the NPT) and the former Soviet republics Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Nuclear Notebook, the total number of nuclear weapons worldwide is estimated at 9,220 in 2017.\n\nThe following is a list of states that have admitted the possession of nuclear weapons or are presumed to possess them, the approximate number of warheads under their control, and the year they tested their first weapon and their force configuration. This list is informally known in global politics as the \"Nuclear Club\". With the exception of Russia and the United States (which have subjected their nuclear forces to independent verification under various treaties) these figures are estimates, in some cases quite unreliable estimates. In particular, under the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty thousands of Russian and U.S. nuclear warheads are inactive in stockpiles awaiting processing. The fissile material contained in the warheads can then be recycled for use in nuclear reactors.\n\nFrom a high of 68,000 active weapons in 1985, there are some 4,000 active nuclear warheads and 10,100 total nuclear warheads in the world. Many of the decommissioned weapons were simply stored or partially dismantled, not destroyed.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that since the dawn of the Atomic Age, the delivery methods of most states with nuclear weapons has evolved with some achieving a nuclear triad, while others have consolidated away from land and air deterrents to submarine-based forces.\n\nThese five states are known to have detonated a nuclear explosive before 1 January 1967 and are thus nuclear weapons states under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. They also happen to be the UN Security Council's permanent members with veto power on UNSC resolutions.\n\nThe United States developed the first nuclear weapons during World War II in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada as part of the Manhattan Project, out of the fear that Nazi Germany would develop them first. It tested the first nuclear weapon on July 16, 1945 (\"Trinity\") at 5:30 am, and remains the only country to have used nuclear weapons in war, devastating the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was the first nation to develop the hydrogen bomb, testing an experimental prototype in 1952 (\"Ivy Mike\") and a deployable weapon in 1954 (\"Castle Bravo\"). Throughout the Cold War it continued to modernize and enlarge its nuclear arsenal, but from 1992 on has been involved primarily in a program of Stockpile stewardship. The U.S. nuclear arsenal contained 31,175 warheads at its Cold War height (in 1966). During the Cold War, the United States built approximately 70,000 nuclear warheads, more than all other nuclear-weapon states combined.\n\nThe Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon (\"RDS-1\") in 1949. This crash project was developed partially with information obtained via espionage during and after World War II. The Soviet Union was the second nation to have developed and tested a nuclear weapon. The direct motivation for Soviet weapons development was to achieve a balance of power during the Cold War. It tested its first megaton-range hydrogen bomb (\"RDS-37\") in 1955. The Soviet Union also tested the most powerful explosive ever detonated by humans, (\"Tsar Bomba\"), with a theoretical yield of 100 megatons, intentionally reduced to 50 when detonated. After its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet weapons entered officially into the possession of the Russian Federation. The Soviet nuclear arsenal contained some 45,000 warheads at its peak (in 1986); the Soviet Union built about 55,000 nuclear warheads since 1949.\n\nThe United Kingdom tested its first nuclear weapon (\"Hurricane\") in 1952. The UK had provided considerable impetus and initial research for the early conception of the atomic bomb, aided by Austrian, German and Polish physicists working at British universities who had either fled or decided not to return to Nazi Germany or Nazi controlled territories. The UK collaborated closely with the United States and Canada during the Manhattan Project, but had to develop its own method for manufacturing and detonating a bomb as U.S. secrecy grew after 1945. The United Kingdom was the third country in the world, after the United States and Soviet Union, to develop and test a nuclear weapon. Its programme was motivated to have an independent deterrent against the Soviet Union, while also maintaining its status as a great power. It tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1957 (Operation Grapple), making it the third country to do so after the United States and Soviet Union. The UK maintained a fleet of V bomber strategic bombers and ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) equipped with nuclear weapons during the Cold War. It currently maintains a fleet of four 'Vanguard' class ballistic missile submarines equipped with Trident II missiles. In 2016, the UK House of Commons voted to renew the British nuclear weapons system with the \"Dreadnought\"-class submarine, without setting a date for the commencement of service of a replacement to the current system.\n\nFrance tested its first nuclear weapon in 1960 (\"Gerboise Bleue\"), based mostly on its own research. It was motivated by the Suez Crisis diplomatic tension \"vis-à-vis\" both the Soviet Union and the Free World allies United States and United Kingdom. It was also relevant to retain great power status, alongside the United Kingdom, during the post-colonial Cold War (see: Force de frappe). France tested its first hydrogen bomb in 1968 (\"Opération Canopus\"). After the Cold War, France has disarmed 175 warheads with the reduction and modernization of its arsenal that has now evolved to a dual system based on submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and medium-range air-to-surface missiles (Rafale fighter-bombers). However new nuclear weapons are in development and reformed nuclear squadrons were trained during Enduring Freedom operations in Afghanistan. France signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992. In January 2006, President Jacques Chirac stated a terrorist act or the use of weapons of mass destruction against France would result in a nuclear counterattack. In February 2015, President Francois Hollande stressed the need for a nuclear deterrent in \"a dangerous world\". He also detailed the French deterrent as \"less than 300\" nuclear warheads, three sets of 16 submarine-launched ballistic missiles and 54 medium-range air-to-surface missiles\" and urged other states to show similar transparency.\n\nChina tested its first nuclear weapon device (\"596\") in 1964 at the Lop Nur test site. The weapon was developed as a deterrent against both the United States and the Soviet Union. Two years later, China had a fission bomb capable of being put onto a nuclear missile. It tested its first hydrogen bomb (\"Test No. 6\") in 1967, a mere 32 months after testing its first nuclear weapon (the shortest fission-to-fusion development known in history). The country is currently thought to have had a stockpile of around 240 warheads, though because of the limited information available, estimates range from 100 to 400. China is the only NPT nuclear-weapon state to give an unqualified negative security assurance with its \"no first use\" policy.<ref name=\"S/1995/265\"></ref> China signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1992. On February 25, 2015 U.S. Vice Admiral Joseph Mulloy stated to the House Armed Services Committee's seapower subcommittee that the U.S. does not believe the PLAN currently deploys SLBMs on their submarine fleet.\n\nIndia is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. India tested what it called a \"peaceful nuclear explosive\" in 1974 (which became known as \"Smiling Buddha\"). The test was the first test developed after the creation of the NPT, and created new questions about how civilian nuclear technology could be diverted secretly to weapons purposes (dual-use technology). India's secret development caused great concern and anger particularly from nations, such as Canada, that had supplied its nuclear reactors for peaceful and power generating needs. \n\nIndian officials rejected the NPT in the 1960s on the grounds that it created a world of nuclear \"haves\" and \"have-nots\", arguing that it unnecessarily restricted \"peaceful activity\" (including \"peaceful nuclear explosives\"), and that India would not accede to international control of their nuclear facilities unless all other countries engaged in unilateral disarmament of their own nuclear weapons. The Indian position has also asserted that the NPT is in many ways a neo-colonial regime designed to deny security to post-colonial powers. Even after its 1974 test, India maintained that its nuclear capability was primarily \"peaceful\", but between 1988 and 1990 it apparently weaponized two dozen nuclear weapons for delivery by air. In 1998 India tested weaponized nuclear warheads (\"Operation Shakti\"), including a thermonuclear device.\n\nIn July 2005, U.S. President George W. Bush and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced plans to conclude an Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement. This came to fruition through a series of steps that included India's announced plan to separate its civil and military nuclear programs in March 2006, the passage of the India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement by the U.S. Congress in December 2006, the conclusion of a U.S.–India nuclear cooperation agreement in July 2007, approval by the IAEA of an India-specific safeguards agreement, agreement by the Nuclear Suppliers Group to a waiver of export restrictions for India, approval by the U.S. Congress and culminating in the signature of U.S.–India agreement for civil nuclear cooperation in October 2008. The U.S. State Department said it made it \"very clear that we will not recognize India as a nuclear-weapon state\". The United States is bound by the Hyde Act with India and may cease all cooperation with India if India detonates a nuclear explosive device. The US had further said it is not its intention to assist India in the design, construction or operation of sensitive nuclear technologies through the transfer of dual-use items. In establishing an exemption for India, the Nuclear Suppliers Group reserved the right to consult on any future issues which might trouble it. As of December 2017, India was estimated to have a stockpile of around 130 warheads.\n\nPakistan also is not a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Pakistan covertly developed nuclear weapons over decades, beginning in the late 1970s. Pakistan first delved into nuclear power after the establishment of its first nuclear power plant near Karachi with equipment and materials supplied mainly by western nations in the early 1970s. Pakistani President Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto promised in 1971 that if India could build nuclear weapons then Pakistan would too, according to him: \"We will develop Nuclear stockpiles, even if we have to eat grass.\"\n\nIt is believed that Pakistan has possessed nuclear weapons since the mid-1980s. The United States continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess such weapons until 1990, when sanctions were imposed under the Pressler Amendment, requiring a cutoff of U.S. economic and military assistance to Pakistan. In 1998, Pakistan conducted its first six nuclear tests at the Ras Koh Hills in response to the five tests conducted by India a few weeks before.\n\nIn 2004, the Pakistani metallurgist Abdul Qadeer Khan, a key figure in Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, confessed to heading an international black market ring involved in selling nuclear weapons technology. In particular, Khan had been selling gas centrifuge technology to North Korea, Iran, and Libya. Khan denied complicity by the Pakistani government or Army, but this has been called into question by journalists and IAEA officials, and was later contradicted by statements from Khan himself.\n\nAs of early 2013, Pakistan was estimated to have had a stockpile of around 140 warheads, and in November 2014 it was projected that by 2020 Pakistan would have enough fissile material for 200 warheads.\n\nNorth Korea was a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but announced a withdrawal on January 10, 2003, after the United States accused it of having a secret uranium enrichment program and cut off energy assistance under the 1994 Agreed Framework. In February 2005, North Korea claimed to possess functional nuclear weapons, though their lack of a test at the time led many experts to doubt the claim. However, in October 2006, North Korea stated that, in response to growing intimidation by the United States, it would conduct a nuclear test to confirm its nuclear status. North Korea reported a successful nuclear test on October 9, 2006 (see 2006 North Korean nuclear test). Most U.S. intelligence officials believed that the test was probably only partially successful with a yield of less than a kiloton. North Korea conducted a second, higher yield test on 25 May 2009 (see 2009 North Korean nuclear test) and a third test with still higher yield on 12 February 2013 (see 2013 North Korean nuclear test). North Korea claimed to have conducted its first hydrogen-bomb test on 5 January 2016, though measurements of seismic disturbances indicate that the detonation was not consistent with a hydrogen bomb. However, on 3 September 2017, North Korea detonated a device which caused a magnitude 6.1 tremor, consistent with a low-powered thermonuclear detonation; NORSAR estimates the yield at 250 kilotons of TNT.\n\nIsrael is widely believed to have been the sixth country in the world to develop nuclear weapons, but has not acknowledged its nuclear forces. It had \"rudimentary, but deliverable,\" nuclear weapons available as early as 1966. Israel is not a party to the NPT. Israel engages in strategic ambiguity, saying it would not be the first country to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons into the region, but refusing to otherwise confirm or deny a nuclear weapons program or arsenal. This policy of \"nuclear opacity\" has been interpreted as an attempt to get the benefits of deterrence with a minimum political cost.\n\nAccording to the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Federation of American Scientists, Israel likely possesses around 75–200 nuclear weapons. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that Israel has approximately 80 intact nuclear weapons, of which 50 are for delivery by Jericho II medium-range ballistic missiles and 30 are gravity bombs for delivery by aircraft. SIPRI also reports that there was renewed speculation in 2012 that Israel may also have developed nuclear-capable submarine-launched cruise missiles.\n\n\nUnder NATO nuclear weapons sharing, the United States has provided nuclear weapons for Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey to deploy and store. This involves pilots and other staff of the \"non-nuclear\" NATO states practicing, handling, and delivering the U.S. nuclear bombs, and adapting non-U.S. warplanes to deliver U.S. nuclear bombs. However, since all U.S. nuclear weapons are protected with Permissive Action Links, the host states cannot easily arm the bombs without authorization codes from the U.S. Department of Defense. Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga acknowledged the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons in Italy. U.S. nuclear weapons were also deployed in Canada as well as Greece from 1963 to 1984. However, Canada withdrew three of the four nuclear-capable weapons systems by 1972. The single system retained, the AIR-2 Genie, had a yield of 1.5 kilotons, was designed to strike enemy aircraft as opposed to ground targets, and might not have qualified as a weapon of mass destruction given its limited yield.\n\nMembers of the Non-Aligned Movement have called on all countries to \"refrain from nuclear sharing for military purposes under any kind of security arrangements.\" The Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) has criticized the arrangement for allegedly violating Articles I and II of the NPT, arguing that \"these Articles do not permit the NWS to delegate the control of their nuclear weapons directly or indirectly to others.\" NATO has argued that the weapons' sharing is compliant with the NPT because \"the U.S. nuclear weapons based in Europe are in the sole possession and under constant and complete custody and control of the United States.\"\n\nNuclear weapons have been present in many nations, often as staging grounds under control of other powers. However, in only one instance has a nation given up nuclear weapons after being in full control of them. The fall of the Soviet Union left several former Soviet republics in physical possession of nuclear weapons, though not operational control which was dependent on Russian-controlled electronic Permissive Action Links and the Russian command and control system.\n\nSouth Africa produced six nuclear weapons in the 1980s, but dismantled them in the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1979, there was a detection of a putative covert nuclear test in the Indian Ocean, called the Vela incident. It has long been speculated that it was a test by Israel, in collaboration with and support of South Africa, though this has never been confirmed. South Africa could not have constructed such a nuclear bomb until November 1979, two months after the \"double flash\" incident.\nSouth Africa signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1991.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3649527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3649527", "title": "Los Olvidados", "text": "Los Olvidados\n\nLos Olvidados (, Spanish for \"The Forgotten Ones\"), known in the U.S. as The Young and the Damned, is a 1950 Mexican film directed by Luis Buñuel.\n\nÓscar Dancigers, the producer, asked Buñuel to direct this film after the success of the 1949 film \"El Gran Calavera\". Buñuel already had a script ready titled \"¡Mi huerfanito jefe!\" about a boy who sells lottery tickets. However, Dancigers had in mind a more realistic and serious depiction of children in poverty in Mexico City.\n\nAfter conducting some research, Jesús Camacho and Buñuel came up with a script that Dancigers was pleased with. The film can be seen in the tradition of social realism, although it also contains elements of surrealism present in much of Buñuel's work.\n\n\"Los Olvidados\" was widely criticized upon its initial release, but earned the Best Director award at the 1951 Cannes Film Festival. It is now considered a masterpiece of Latin American cinema.\n\n\nThe film is about a group of destitute children and their misfortunes in a Mexico City slum. El Jaibo escapes juvenile jail and reunites with the street gang that he leads. They attempts to rob a blind street musician and, failing at first, later track him down, beat him, and destroy his instruments.\n\nWith the help of Pedro, El Jaibo tracks down Julián, the youngster who supposedly sent him to jail. El Jaibo puts his unharmed arm in a sling, hides a rock in it and confronts Julián, who denies that he reported him to the police and refuses to fight El Jaibo because it wouldn't be a fair fight. As Julián starts to walk away, El Jaibo hits him in the back of the head with the rock. He then beats Julián heavily with a stick and takes his money. El Jaibo warns Pedro not to report the crime and shares Julián's money with Pedro to make him an accomplice.\n\nPedro's mother resents her son's behavior, and shows that she doesn't love or care for him. Pedro is saddened by this, vows to start behaving better and finds work as apprentice to a blacksmith. One day, El Jaibo comes to talk with him about their secret and, unbeknownst to Pedro, steals a customer's knife from the blacksmith's table. Pedro is accused of the crime and sent to a juvenile rehabilitation program, the \"farm school,\" where he gets into a fight and kills two chickens. The principal tests Pedro by handing Pedro a 50 pesos bill to run errands with. Pedro accepts and leaves with the intention to complete the errands. As soon as he leaves, he encounters El Jaibo, who steals the money. Upset that his attempt to be good was foiled again, Pedro tracks down El Jaibo and fights him. The fight ends in a stalemate, but Pedro announces to the crowd that it was El Jaibo who killed Julián. El Jaibo flees, but the blind man has heard the accusation and tells the police.\n\nPedro tracks El Jaibo down once again to murder him. El Jaibo kills Pedro. While fleeing, El Jaibo encounters the police and, as he tries to run away, the police shoot and kill him. Meche and her grandfather find Pedro's body in their shed. Not wanting to get involved, they dump his body down a garbage-covered cliff. On their way, they pass Pedro's mother, who, though once unconcerned with her disobedient child, is now searching for him.\n\nIn 2002, it was announced that an alternate ending for \"Los Olvidados\" (labeled \"the happy ending\") was discovered at the Film Warehouse of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and it would be restored digitally in order to show it to the public. On July 8, 2005, it was re-screened with the alternate ending in a few selected venues and included in subsequent DVD releases.\nAt the International Cinematographic Festival in Saltillo, Coahuila, Mexico, on February 3, 2011, the last surviving member of the cast, Alfonso Mejía (Pedro), introduced the alternative ending to the film.\n\nAccording to Mejía, Buñuel was \"pressured by the censorship in Mexico, and urged to film an alternative ending, a conventional ending, to maintain the image of a progressive Mexico, where no one was poor or illiterate\" (you can view the interview ).\n\nThe alternative ending begins with El Jaibo and Pedro fighting in an abandoned warehouse. Pedro pushes El Jaibo from the roof, where he falls to his death. Pedro frisks the body for the money El Jaibo stole from him (in contrast to the original ending, where Pedro is murdered by El Jaibo). Pedro returns to the farm school with the money that the principal entrusted to him.\n\nThematically, \"Los Olvidados\" is similar to Buñuel's earlier Spanish film, \"Las Hurdes\". Both films deal with the never-ending cycle of poverty and despair. \"Los Olvidados\" is especially interesting because although “Buñuel employed … elements of Italian neorealism,” a concurrent movement across the Atlantic Ocean marked by “outdoor locations, nonprofessional actors, low budget productions, and a focus on the working classes,” \"Los Olvidados\" is not a neorealist film (Fernandez, 42). “Neorealist reality is incomplete, conventional, and above all rational,” Buñuel wrote in a 1953 essay titled \"Poetry and Cinema.\" “The poetry, the mystery, all that completes and enlarges tangible reality is utterly lacking.” (Sklar, 324) \"Los Olvidados\" contains such surrealistic shots as when “a boy throws an egg at the camera lens, where it shatters and drips” or a scene in which a boy has a dream in slow-motion (Sklar, 324). The surrealist dream sequence was actually shot in reverse and switched in post-production. Buñuel does not romanticize the characters, and even the abused blind man is revealed to have cruel habits of preying on children and selling fake elixirs.\n\n\"Los Olvidados\" was largely disparaged by the Mexican press upon its release. Juan Carlos Ibáñez and Manuel Palacio write, \"The film was so harsh and innovative, so critical and daring in its statements that during its first screenings, spectators openly aired their indignation towards the features of Mexican identity presented by Buñuel.\" The work was also criticized as overly bleak.\n\nMany critics have since proclaimed \"Los Olvidados\" a masterpiece. It currently holds a 94% score on the website Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews. It was inscribed on UNESCO's \"Memory of the World\" Register in 2003 in recognition of its historical significance.\n\nThe work placed 110th in the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" critics' poll of the greatest films ever made.\n\n\"Los Olvidados\" has been cited as an influence on films such as \"Amores perros\" (2000), \"Pixote\" (1980), and \"City of God\" (2002).\n\n\n"}

Widely regarded as one of the most accomplished forgers in history, Hofmann is especially noted for his creation of documents related to the history of the Latter Day Saint movement. When his schemes began to unravel, he constructed bombs to murder two people in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nMark Hofmann was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. He was raised in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) by two devoutly religious parents. Hofmann was a below-average high school student, but he had many hobbies including magic, electronics, chemistry, and stamp and coin collecting. He and his friends were said to have made bombs for fun on the outskirts of Murray, Utah. According to Hofmann, while still a teenage coin collector, he forged a rare mint mark on a dime and was told by an organization of coin collectors that it was genuine.\n\nLike many young men in the LDS Church, Hofmann volunteered to spend two years as an LDS missionary, and in 1973 the church sent him to the England Southwest Mission, where he was based in Bristol. Hofmann told his parents that he had baptized several converts; he did not tell them that he had also perused Fawn M. Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith, \"No Man Knows My History\". While in England, Hofmann also enjoyed investigating bookshops and buying early Mormon material as well as books critiquing Mormonism. Hofmann later told prosecutors that he had lost his faith in the LDS Church when he was about fourteen. He'd learned that his maternal grandparents had continued to secretly practice polygamy for more than a decade after the church publicly ended the practice (it was not fully renounced until 1904). A former girlfriend believed he performed his mission only because of social pressure and the desire not to disappoint his parents.\n\nAfter Hofmann returned from his mission, he enrolled as a pre-med major at Utah State University. In 1979, he married Doralee Olds, and the couple eventually had four children. Dorie Olds Hofmann filed for divorce in 1987 and became co-founder of a holistic healing company.\n\nIn 1980, Hofmann claimed that he had found a 17th-century King James Bible with a folded paper gummed inside. The document seemed to be the transcript that Joseph Smith's scribe Martin Harris had presented to Charles Anthon, a Columbia classics professor, in 1828. According to the Mormon scripture Joseph Smith–History, the transcript and its unusual reformed Egyptian characters were copied by Smith from the golden plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon.\n\nHofmann constructed his version to fit Anthon's description of the document, and its discovery made Hofmann's reputation. Dean Jessee, an editor of Joseph Smith's papers and the best-known expert on handwriting and old documents in the Historical Department of the LDS Church, concluded that the document was a Smith holograph. The LDS Church announced the discovery of the Anthon Transcript in April and purchased it from Hofmann for more than $20,000. Appraised by the LDS Church for $25,000, it was purchased on October 13 in exchange for several artifacts the church owned in duplicate, including a $5 gold Mormon coin, Deseret banknotes, and a first edition of the Book of Mormon. Assuming the document to be genuine, prominent Mormon academic Hugh Nibley predicted that the discovery promised \"as good a test as we'll ever get of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon\" because he thought the paper might be translated. Zoology professor Barry Fell soon after claimed to have decoded the text.\n\nHofmann promptly dropped out of school and went into business as a dealer in rare books. He soon fabricated other historically significant documents and became noted among LDS Church history buffs for his \"discoveries\" of previously unknown materials pertaining to the Latter Day Saint movement. These deceived not only members of the First Presidency — notably Gordon B. Hinckley, then the \"de facto\" president of the church due to the poor health of more senior leaders — but also document experts and distinguished historians. According to Richard and Joan Ostling, Hofmann was by this time a \"closet apostate\" motivated not only by greed but also by \"the desire to embarrass the church by undermining church history.\"\n\nDuring the early 1980s, a significant number of new Mormon documents came into the marketplace. Sometimes the church received these as donations, and others it purchased. According to the Ostlings, \"The church publicized some of the acquisitions; it orchestrated public relations for some that were known to be sensitive; others it acquired secretly and suppressed.\"\n\nIn 1981, Hofmann arrived at the headquarters of the LDS Church with a document which supposedly provided evidence that Smith had designated his son Joseph Smith III, rather than Brigham Young, as his successor. In a forged cover letter, purportedly written by Thomas Bullock and dated January 27, 1865, Bullock chastises Young for having all copies of the blessing destroyed. Bullock writes that although he believes Young to be the legitimate leader of the LDS Church, he would keep his copy of the blessing. Such a letter, if true, would portray Young and, by extension, the LDS Church, in an unfavorable light. In February 1981, Hofmann tried to sell the letter to the chief archivist of the LDS Church. Hofmann expected the church to \"buy the blessing on the spot and \"bury\" it.\" When the archivist balked at the price, Hofmann offered it to the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church; now known as the Community of Christ), which had always claimed that the line of succession had been bestowed on Smith's descendants but had never had written proof. A scramble to acquire the document occurred, and Hofmann, posing as a faithful Mormon, presented it to his church in exchange for items worth more than $20,000. Nevertheless, Hofmann also ensured that the document would be made public. The next day, a \"New York Times\" headline read, \"Mormon Document Raises Doubts on Succession of Church's Leaders,\" and the LDS Church was forced to confirm the discovery and publicly present the document to the RLDS Church.\n\nDuring the race by the Utah and Missouri churches to acquire the blessing document, Hofmann discovered \"a lever to exercise enormous power over his church,\" a power to \"menace and manipulate its leaders with nothing more sinister than a sheet of paper.\" Salt Lake County District Attorney's investigator Michael George believed that, after Hofmann had successfully forged the blessing, his ultimate goal was to create the lost 116 pages of the Book of Mormon, which he could have filled with inconsistencies and errors, sell them \"to the church to be hidden away\" and then — as he had done often with embarrassing documents — \"make sure its contents were made public.\"\n\nPerhaps the most notorious of Hofmann's Mormon forgeries, the Salamander letter, appeared in 1984. Supposedly written by Harris to W. W. Phelps, the letter presented a version of the recovery of the gold plates that contrasted markedly with the church-sanctioned version of events. Not only did the forgery intimate that Smith had been practicing \"money digging\" through magical practices, but it also replaced the angel that Smith said had appeared to him with a white salamander.\n\nAfter the letter had been purchased for the church and become public knowledge, LDS Church apostle Dallin H. Oaks asserted to Mormon educators that the words \"white salamander\" could be reconciled with Smith's Angel Moroni because, in the 1820s, the word \"salamander\" might also refer to a mythical being thought to be able to live in fire, and a \"being that is able to live in fire is a good approximation of the description Joseph Smith gave of the Angel Moroni.\"\n\nIn 1984, Jerald and Sandra Tanner, critics of the LDS Church, became the first to declare the letter a forgery despite the fact that it, as well as others of Hofmann's \"discoveries,\" would have strengthened the Tanners' arguments against the veracity of official Mormon history. Document expert Kenneth W. Rendell later said that while there was \"the absence of any indication of forgery in the letter itself, there was also no evidence that it was genuine.\"\n\nNo one is certain how many forged documents Hofmann created during the early 1980s, but they included a letter from Joseph Smith's mother, Lucy Mack Smith, describing the origin of the Book of Mormon; letters from Martin Harris and David Whitmer, two of the Three Witnesses, each giving a personal account of their visions; a contract between Smith and Egbert Bratt Grandin for the printing of the first edition of the Book of Mormon; and two pages of the original Book of Mormon manuscript taken in dictation from Smith to Oliver Cowdery.\n\nIn 1983, Hofmann bypassed the LDS Church's historical department and sold to Gordon B. Hinckley, a member of the First Presidency of the church, an 1825 Joseph Smith holograph purporting to confirm that Smith had been treasure hunting and practicing black magic five years after his First Vision. Hofmann had the signature authenticated by Charles Hamilton, the contemporary \"dean of American autograph dealers,\" sold the letter to the church for $15,000, and gave his word that no one else had a copy. Then Hofmann leaked its existence to the press, after which the church was virtually forced to release the letter to scholars for study, despite previously denying it had it in its possession.\n\nTo make this sudden flood of important Mormon documents seem plausible, Hofmann explained that he relied on a network of tipsters, had methodically tracked down modern descendants of early Mormons, and had mined collections of 19th-century letters that had been saved by collectors for their postmarks rather than for their contents.\n\nIn addition to documents from Mormon history, Hofmann also forged and sold signatures of many famous non-Mormons, including George Washington, John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Daniel Boone, John Brown, Andrew Jackson, Mark Twain, Nathan Hale, John Hancock, Francis Scott Key, Abraham Lincoln, John Milton, Paul Revere, Myles Standish, and Button Gwinnett, whose signature was the rarest, and therefore the most valuable, of any signer of the Declaration of Independence. Hofmann also forged a previously unknown poem in the hand of Emily Dickinson. But Hofmann's grandest scheme was to forge what was perhaps the most famous missing document in American colonial history, the \"Oath of a Freeman\". The one-page \"Oath\" had been printed in 1639, the first document to be printed in Britain's American colonies; but only about fifty copies had been made, and none of these was extant. A genuine example was probably worth over one million dollars in 1985, and Hofmann's agents began to negotiate a sale to the Library of Congress.\n\nDespite the considerable amounts of money Hofmann had made from document sales, he was deeply in debt, in part because of his increasingly lavish lifestyle and his purchases of genuine first-edition books. In an effort to clear his debts, he attempted to broker a sale of the \"McLellin collection\"—a supposedly extensive group of documents written by William E. McLellin, an early Mormon apostle who eventually broke with the LDS Church. Hofmann hinted that the McLellin collection would provide revelations unfavorable to the LDS Church. But Hofmann had no idea where the McLellin collection was, nor did he have the time to forge a suitably large group of documents. Those to whom Hofmann had promised documents or repayments of debts began to hound him, and the sale of the \"Oath of a Freeman\" was delayed by questions about its authenticity.\n\nIn an effort to buy more time, Hofmann began constructing bombs. On October 15, 1985, he first killed document collector Steven Christensen, the son of a locally prominent clothier, Mac Christensen. Later the same day, a second bomb killed Kathy Sheets, the wife of Christensen's former employer. As Hofmann had intended, police initially suspected that the bombings were related to the impending collapse of an investment business of which Sheets's husband, J. Gary Sheets, was the principal and Christensen his protégé. The following day, Hofmann himself was severely injured when a bomb exploded in his car. Although police quickly focused on Hofmann as the suspect in the bombings, some of Hofmann's business associates went into hiding, fearing they might also become victims.\n\nDuring the bombing investigation, police discovered evidence of the forgeries in Hofmann's basement. They also found the engraving plant where he had had the forged plate for the \"Oath of a Freeman\" made. (Hofmann had made two significant errors in his \"Oath,\" creating a version impossible to have been set in type.)\n\nDocument examiner George Throckmorton analyzed several Hofmann documents that had previously been deemed authentic and determined they were forgeries. Three letters purportedly written from an Illinois prison by Joseph Smith used different ink, paper, and writing instruments. (Because the letters had been authenticated by different experts, the inconsistencies had earlier escaped detection.) Throckmorton also discovered that some documents, supposedly written by different people, had similar writing styles and that they had been written with homemade iron gall ink that looked cracked like alligator skin under a microscope, although authentic period ink did not. Investigators also found that a poem used to authenticate the handwriting in the Salamander Letter had been forged by Hofmann and inserted in a \"Book of Common Prayer\" once owned by Martin Harris.\n\nHofmann was arrested in January 1986 and charged on four indictments totaling 27 counts, including first-degree murder, delivering a bomb, constructing or possessing a bomb, theft by deception, and communication fraud. A fifth indictment, containing an additional five counts of theft by deception, was added later in January. He initially maintained his innocence. However, at a preliminary hearing, prosecutors produced voluminous evidence of his forgeries and debts, as well as evidence linking him to the bombs.\n\nHofmann not only faced the prospect of the death penalty in Utah, but was indicted on federal charges of possession of an unregistered machine gun. New York prosecutors also sought an indictment for the fraudulent sale of the \"Oath of a Freeman.\" In January 1987, Hofmann pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, one count of theft by deception for forging the Salamander Letter, and one count of fraud for the bogus sale of the McLellin collection. Hofmann agreed to confess his forgeries in open court, in return for which prosecutors in Utah and New York dropped additional charges against him. He was sentenced to five years to life in prison.\n\nIn 1988, before the Utah Board of Pardons, Hofmann said that he thought planting the bomb that killed Kathy Sheets was \"almost a game … at the time I made the bomb, my thoughts were that it didn't matter if it was Mrs. Sheets, a child, a dog … whoever\" was killed. Within the hour the parole board, struck by Hofmann's \"callous disregard for human life,\" decided that he would indeed serve his \"natural life in prison.\"\n\nAfter Hofmann was imprisoned, he was excommunicated by the LDS Church and his wife filed for divorce. Hofmann attempted suicide in his cell by taking an overdose of antidepressants. He was revived but not before spending twelve hours lying on his right arm, blocking its circulation, and causing muscle atrophy. His forging hand was thereby permanently disabled.\n\nHofmann, Utah Department of Corrections offender number 41235, was originally incarcerated at Utah State Prison in Draper. However, in 2016, he was transferred to Central Utah Correctional Facility in Gunnison.\n\nAs a master forger, Hofmann deceived a number of renowned document experts during his short career. Some of his forgeries were accepted by scholars for years, and an unknown number of them may still be in circulation. But it is Hofmann's forgeries of Mormon documents that have had the greatest historical significance. In August 1987, the sensationalist aspects of the Hofmann case led apostle Dallin H. Oaks to believe that church members had witnessed \"some of the most intense LDS Church-bashing since the turn of the [20th] century.\" A student of Mormonism, Jan Shipps, agreed that press reports \"contained an astonishing amount of innuendo associating Hofmann's plagiarism with Mormon beginnings. Myriad reports alleged secrecy and cover-up on the part of LDS general authorities, and not a few writers referred to the way in which a culture that rests on a found scripture is particularly vulnerable to the offerings of con-artists.\"\n\nAccording to the Ostlings, the Hofmann forgeries could only have been perpetrated \"in connection with the curious mixture of paranoia and obsessiveness with which Mormons approach church history.\" After Hofmann's exposure, the LDS Church tried to correct the record, but the \"public relations damage as well as the forgery losses meant the church was also a Hofmann victim.\" Robert Lindsey has also suggested that Hofmann \"stimulated a burst of historical inquiry regarding Joseph Smith's youthful enthusiasm for magic [that] did not wither after his conviction\".\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Sultan Abdulmejid I. He was succeeded by his half-brother Mehmed VI. His nine-year reign was marked by the cession of the Empire's North African territories and the Dodecanese Islands, including Rhodes, in the Italo-Turkish War, the traumatic loss of almost all of the Empire's European territories west of Constantinople in the First Balkan War, and the entry of the Empire into World War I, which would ultimately lead to the end of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHe was born at the Topkapı Palace, Constantinople. Like many other potential heirs to the throne, he was confined for 30 years in the Harems of the palace. For nine of those years he was in solitary confinement. During this time he studied poetry of the old Persian style and was an acclaimed poet. On his ninth birthday he was ceremoniously circumcised in the special Circumcision Room (Sünnet Odasi) of Topkapı Palace.\n\nHis reign began on 27 April 1909, but he was largely a figurehead with no real political power, as a consequence of the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 (which restored the Ottoman Constitution and Parliament) and especially the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état, which brought the dictatorial triumvirate of the Three Pashas to power.\n\nUnder his rule, the Ottoman Empire lost all its remaining territory in North Africa (Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Fezzan) to Italy in the Italo-Turkish War and nearly all its European territories (except for a small strip of land west of Constantinople) in the First Balkan War. The sudden loss of these enormous swathes of land, which had been Ottoman territory for centuries and were ceded to its opponents within a span of only two years, was deeply shocking to the Ottoman Turks and resulted in massive popular backlash against the government, culminating in the 1913 Ottoman coup d'etat.\n\nMehmed V's most significant political act was to formally declare jihad against the Entente Powers (Allies of World War I) on 14 November 1914, following the Ottoman government's decision to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers. He was actually said to look with disfavor on the pro-German policy of Enver Pasha.\n\nThis was the last genuine proclamation of jihad in history by a Caliph, as the Caliphate lasted until 1924. The proclamation had no noticeable effect on the war, despite the fact that many Muslims lived in Ottoman territories. Some Arabs eventually joined the British forces against the Ottomans with the Arab Revolt in 1916.\n\nMehmed V hosted Kaiser Wilhelm II, his World War I ally, in Constantinople on 15 October 1917. He was made Generalfeldmarschall of the Kingdom of Prussia on 27 January 1916, and of the German Empire on 1 February 1916.\n\nMehmed V died at Yıldız Palace on 3 July 1918 at the age of 73, only four months before the end of World War I. Thus, he did not live to see the downfall of the Ottoman Empire. He spent most of his life at the Dolmabahçe Palace and Yıldız Palace in Istanbul. His grave is in the Eyüp district.\n\nMehmed V was Grand Master of the following Ottoman Orders:\n\n\n\nSultan Mehmed Reşad had five consorts:\n\nHe had three sons:\n"}

O'Rourke and Doug Kenney and art-directed by David Kaestle. Much of the writing was by P. J. O'Rourke and Doug Kenney. The \"literary magazine\" was written by Sean Kelly; the sports page was by Christopher Cerf; and the Principal's Letter and the \"In Memorium\" piece were both by Ed Subitzky.\n\nThe book, as it was originally published, appeared to be a genuine 1964 yearbook from \"C.

O'Rourke attended DHS for a couple of years in the early 1960s. The swim team photo caption contains the names of a number of O'Rourke's friends from Devilbiss.

The current number one song is \"thank u, next\" by Ariana Grande. \n\nRIM has begun publishing charts since mid-1996, at the time where singles market were almost non-existent in Malaysia. The chart is, therefore, more focused on charting albums based on weekly sales. On October 1996, RIM started incorporating electronic point-of-sale (EPOS) into its chart, compiling data from more than 50 retail stores such as Salem Power Station, Music Valley and CD Rama. However, the charts were discontinued in 2006 owing to dwindling album sales in relation to public disinterest to buy album as a whole and difficulties to tabulate the charts due to insufficient information from the retailers on the physical sales.\n\nIn 2016, digital music consumption in Malaysia accounted for RM 72.7 mil revenue (39.2%) to the Malaysian music industry in 2016, of which RM31.1mil is contributed from audio streaming alone. From this statistics, RIM stated that the digital music chart \"has now clearly grown to the point where an official chart is needed\". The first number-one song on this revived chart (week ending February 9, 2017) was \"Shape of You\" by Ed Sheeran, while the first number-one local song (during the same week period) was Wanita Terakhir by Fattah Amin.\n\nCurrently, the main RIM Chart lists the Top 20 most streamed songs in Malaysia, with a separate chart for the Top 10 most streamed domestic songs.

Adults are found off the coast at depths of ; juveniles may be found in coastal waters such as fjords. The adults are slow-moving, gregarious fish, of some commercial importance. They can reach , though most only are about half that length. They are viviparous. Individuals live up to 75 years and enter reproduction rather late. While the young fish are of brownish color, the adults are bright red.\n\nThe rose fish appeared on a 15-pfennig stamp of West Germany in 1964.\n\nOne of the main fishing areas of the rose fish is the Irminger Sea between Iceland and southeastern Greenland.\nWhile annual catches during the 1980s and 90s were less than 20 kilotons, this has increased dramatically since 1999, to between 40 and 60 kilotons. In 2000, almost 80 kilotons were caught. Since then, annual catch has declined back to between 40 and 60 kilotons. The meat of this fish is almost always sold filleted, often frozen.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, populations have been considered severely overfished. According to Greenpeace, some populations are no longer reproducing sufficiently, and their chances of recovery are slim. In 2010, Greenpeace International added the rose fish to its seafood red list. It is also on WWF's list of fish species to avoid, unless the fishery is certified by MSC.

Some of the chronicles were compiled later, such as \"Записки к Сибирской истории служащие\" (Notes, Dedicated to the History of Siberia) and \"Новая Сибирская летопись\" (New Siberian Chronicle) by I.Cherepanov, \"Летопись г.

The traditional scheme of development of the Siberian chronicle-writing was proposed by Sergei Bakhrushin. He thought that Yermak's companions compiled the so-called \"Написание, како приидоша в Сибирь...\" (Notes on How We Came to Siberia) in 1621, which didn't survive to this day. Based on these notes, they compiled the so-called \"Синодик Тобольского собора\" in 1622, or Synodikon of the Tobolsk Cathedral (синодик, from the Greek word \"synodikón\", which means a list of the dead submitted to church for remembrance in prayer). A chronicler Savva Yesipov compiled his own chronicle in 1636 based on the \"Notes...\" and \"Synodikon\". In mid-17th century, they compiled the Stroganov Chronicle based on the \"Notes...\" and archives of the Stroganovs, which has no immediate connection with the Yesipov Chronicle. In the late 16th - second half of the 17th century, they compiled the Kungur Chronicle based on verbal narrations of Yermak's companions and folklore of the late 16th century. The Remezov Chronicle was compiled in the late 17th century.

Teotig was assisted in his enterprise by his British-educated wife, Arshaguhi Teotig (1875-1921)—herself a writer and educator—until her untimely death.\n\nTeotig himself was deported during the Armenian Genocide and managed to survive. After returning to Constantinople in 1922, he fled to Europe on the eve of its occupation by the army of Mustafa Kemal. He then lived a wandering life for the next six years, living in Corfu, Nicosia, and Paris, with the last of his yearbooks being printed in Venice, Vienna, and Paris. He died in May 1928 in Paris, when the 18th volume of his yearbooks (his \"paper children\", as he called them) was in press. His son Vahakn Teotig died in the United States sometime in the 1960s.\n"}

The manuscript is the first of originally two volumes; the second volume has been lost. A third volume consists of a register to vols. 1 and 2, kept in the Halle University Library (signature Halle, UuLB: Zi 33).\n\nIt is an important witness of the transitional period from medieval to classical (early modern) conventions of heraldry (e.g. the papal arms are shown with the keys of Peter crossing behind the shield, a fashion which only gradually became adopted by the popes themselves during the 16th century, while the crossing keys above the shield were first used a few decades earlier, c. 1420s).\n\nOn 261 folia it presents various coats of arms, as was the custom at the time in order of descending rank, beginning with a number of purely fictitious or symbolic coats of arms, that of God, of Jesus Christ, of Death, of the \"first arms\" of kings \"Abysay, Sabytay, Banabias\", of \"King Alphonsus of Castilia\", \"the holy King Job\", the \"holy knight Eustachius\", followed by the (real) royal arms of Sweden, Austria and Thuringia, and the attributed arms of the Nine Worthies.\n\nAfter this, the armorial presents the actual coats of arms in use at the time, beginning with the papal arms of Innocent VIII, the imperial arms of Habsburg Austria and the Imperial Eagle of the Holy Roman Emperor, the royal arms of France (already attributed to Godfrey above), England and Greece. More royal and ducal arms are given, partly real and partly fictitious, including those of the Dauphin, Wessex(?), Italy (kingdom of Naples), Ireland, Outremer (the Jerusalem Cross), and of \"Calistria, queen of the Amazons\", Brittany, \"the great Khan\", Arabia, Nineveh, Granada,\nBavaria, Hessen, Bavaria-Straubing and the Duke of Teck, Lorenzo de' Medici, the \"Sultan of Jerusalem\", some \"eastern empires\" such as Persia, India, Prester John, \"Constantine\" (Byzantium, showing the arms of the Latin Empire), Cathay (China), Scotland, Aragon, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Poland, Antiochia, Ethiopia, Salerno, Castilia, Troy, Nebuchadnezzar, Nero. \n\nAfter this preface, the book begins a more realistic listing of the heraldry of its time, beginning on fol. 20v, organized as follows:\nThe arms of the territories and noble families of the kingdom of Spain, of the high nobility of the Holy Roman Empire, Burgundy, Savoy, Milan and Naples (ff. 20-29); the higher nobility of the Holy Roman Empire in the duchies of Kleve, Geldern, Liegnitz, Werdenberg, Württemberg, the Habsburg territories, and the arms of various counts (foll. 29-85). \nThis is followed by the arms of lower nobility and certain notable bourgeois families (foll. 86-255) and the arms of imperial cities (foll. 257-262).\n\n"}

January 19, 1984 Mt. Kisco, NY) was an American art conservator who led the conservation department of the Frick Collection from 1935 to 1977.\n\nBorn to Midwestern American citizens living in Germany, William Suhr began his career as an apprentice to a stone mason, \"specializing\" in stone Madonnas.\nAfter three years there, he began studying at the Prussian Academy of Arts, where he met and befriended art historian Max Deri, who introduced him to the art of conservation and restoration. Since there were no formal restoration schools at the time, he was essentially self-taught. Working independently in Berlin, he built up his reputation through collaborations with art dealing firm Thomas Agnew & Sons. \n\nSuhr's success in Berlin caught the attention of Wilhelm Valentiner, formerly of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum, who became director of the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1924. In 1927, Suhr accepted Valentiner's invitation to join him in Detroit, where he continued his conservation practice. He worked there until 1935, at which time Frederick Mortimer Clapp offered him a job as permanent conservator at the Frick Collection in New York City. In this role, he was able to take commissions from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, including an extensive restoration of Robert Campin's Mérode Altarpiece, now housed at The Cloisters. \n\nAccording to his Frick Collection colleague Edgar Munhall, Suhr's clients included Jules Bache, Alfred Barnes, Mildred Barnes Bliss, Walter Chrysler, Kenneth Clark, Stephen Clark, Chester Dale, Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen, Edsel Ford, Helen Clay Frick, William Randolph Hearst, Edward James, Samuel Henry Kress, Paul Mellon, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and Georges Wildenstein. Though he dealt primarily with artwork by Old Masters, he also helped conserve works by contemporary artists Salvador Dalí and Lyonel Feininger. Throughout his forty years at the Frick Collection, he kept meticulous records of the conservation procedures he performed, including more than 95 cleaning reports complete with treatment plans, thorough descriptions, and before-and-after photographs. \n\nSuhr retired from the Frick Collection in 1977. He passed away in 1984, survived by his wife Henriette. His papers are held at the Getty Research Institute. His letters are held at the Archives of American Art. \n"}
