Most of the periodical publications in mainly Catholic countries can be regarded as \"Catholic\" literature up to a few decades before 1800: the editorial line is implicitly Catholic in most instances.\n\nThe development of the press in the 19th century was in general terms a major factor in secularization according to Owen Chadwick. On the other hand, mass printing also meant that the \"Pope of 1889 was far more influential that the Pope of 1839 because the later Pope was surrounded by the press and the earlier Pope was not\" wrote Chadwick.\n\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" of 1913 offered an analysis in terms of several factors. Periodical literature includes the political newspaper, the weekly, and literary and specialized magazines and journals appearing less frequently: in some countries such as Spain the implicit Catholicism persisted in the press for many years. The American-style, news-led paper would sell on its news content, rather than editorial line, and therefore Catholic newspapers could compete as dailies. European papers and weeklies relied more on the \"feuilleton\" and generally had more op-ed content. This meant they showed \"greater animosity to the Church\".\n\nThe pioneer Catholic publication in England, \"Andrews' Orthodox Journal\", was first issued in 1812 by Eusebius Andrews, a Catholic printer and bookseller of London. It had just a few years of chequered existence, as there was not a sufficiently large reading public to make it self-supporting.\n\nThe real beginnings of Catholic periodical literature were made more than twenty years later, by which time the growth of the Catholic body in its new emancipation, the progress of Catholic education, and the interest excited by the Tractarian movement had combined to supply a wider circle of readers. Nicholas Wiseman and Daniel O'Connell founded a quarterly, the \"Dublin Review\" (1836). The fame of the \"Edinburgh Review\" suggested a territorial title, and Dublin was chosen as a Catholic centre; but from the first it was edited and published in London. The review was intended to provide a record of current thought for educated Catholics and at the same time to be an exponent of Catholic views to non-Catholic inquirers. Beginning before the first stirrings of the Oxford Movement, it presents a record of the intellectual life of the century and produced articles which had an immense influence upon the religious thought of the times. It was in August 1839 that an article by Wiseman on the Anglican Claim caught the attention of John Henry Newman. Impressed by the application of the words of St. Augustine, \"securus judicat orbis terrarum\", which interpreted and summed up the course of ecclesiastical history, he saw the theory of the Via media \"absolutely pulverized\" (Apologia, 116-7). I\n\nGradually the Tractarian converts appeared in the lists of contributors: Ward, Frederick Oakeley, Marshall, John Brande Morris, Christie, Henry Formby, Capes, Thomas William Allies, Anderson, Manning, and a glance through the volumes of the \"Dublin' will reveal names prominent in the great religious, scientific, and literary movements of the century. During the sixties and the early seventies it was under the direction of Dr. W. G. Ward. After his retirement it was edited by John Cuthbert Hedley, afterwards Bishop of Newport, and then acquired by Cardinal Manning, who appointed Canon Moyes editor. It was the property and under the direction of Wilfrid Ward, son of its previous editor.\n\nThe first issue of the annual \"Catholic Directory\" appeared in 1837. Owing to the Oxford Movement, the forties were a time of marked literary activity. In 1840 two new enterprises were inaugurated. Mr. Dolman, a Catholic publisher in London who had issued a number of important books including the writings of John Lingard and Husenbeth, produced in \"Dolman's Magazine\" a high class literary monthly, and on 16 May 1840, Frederick Lucas became the pioneer of the Catholic newspaper press in England by publishing the first number of \"The Tablet\", a weekly newspaper and review. Lucas regarded his work as founder and editor of a Catholic paper as a sacred mission. His uncompromising views led to difficulties with his financial supporters, but he emerged triumphant.\n\nFor a while after the crisis of 1848 Lucas, then active in Irish politics, removed \"The Tablet\" office to Dublin, but it was brought back to London by the new proprietors, into whose hands it passed when failing health compelled Lucas to give up the editorship. For many years after his death, in 1855, \"The Tablet\" was a mere humdrum record of news. Among the distinguished editors was Cardinal Vaughan who conducted the \"Tablet\" during the stormy discussions on papal infallibility and the First Vatican Council. When he became Bishop of Salford, he placed the editorship in the hands of Elliot Ranken, who was succeeded by John George Snead-Cox. \"The Tablet\", under the terms of the trust created by Cardinal Vaughan, had its profits go to the support of St. Joseph's Missionary College, of which he was the founder.\n\nTwo other notable periodicals were founded in the forties. \"The Tablet\" was a sixpenny paper, reduced to five pence, on the abolition of the newspaper stamp duty. Its price put it beyond the reach of tens of thousands of Catholic workers. To supply them with a penny magazine Mr. Bradley in 1846 founded \"The Lamp\". It gave much of its space to Catholic fiction, descriptive articles, and the like, and ventured on an occasional illustration, a portrait or a picture of a new church; but it also supplied news and reported in full Wiseman's lectures and other notable Catholic utterances. For years it struggled with lack of capital, and for a while Bradley edited his paper from his room in the debtors' prison at York. His name deserves honourable record as the pioneer of the popular Catholic Press. The other paper, \"The Rambler\", of which the first issue appeared on 1 January 1848, was intended to be a review of literature, art, and science. In 1859, Lord Acton, who had then just returned from the Continent, succeeded Newman in the editorship. The price, sixpence, limited its public and in 1862 it became a quarterly under the title of \"The Home and Foreign Review\". In its last years this review was a source of trouble and disedification, and its sale, which dwindled yearly, was largely among Anglicans and other non-Catholics.\n\nIn the mid years of the nineteenth century the abolition of the various taxes on newspapers and the cheapening of the processes of production led to the coming of the penny newspapers. The first Catholic penny paper with permanent success was \"The London Universe\". Its origin was connected with the earlier activity of Lucas, who successfully advocated the introduction of the Conferences of St. Vincent de Paul into England. It was a group of members of the London Conferences who produced \"The Universe\". Speaking to their president George Blount, one evening in 1860 Cardinal Wiseman after alluding to the attacks in the Press against the Holy See said: \"Cannot the Society of St. Vincent de Paul do something to answer those frightful calumnies, by publishing truths, as M. Louis Veuillot is doing in Paris in 'L'Univers'? We want a penny paper, and now that the tax has been removed it should be possible.\" It was decided that, though the society, as such, could not found a newspaper, a committee of its members should undertake the task. It included George Blount, Stuart Knill (afterwards the first Catholic Lord Mayor of London), Viscount Fielding (Lord Denbigh), Viscount Campden (the convert Sir Charles George Noel, 2nd Earl of Gainsborough), Sidney Lescher, Archibald Dunn, Arthur William à Beckett, and George J. Wigley, the London correspondent of the Paris \"Univers\". Wigley secured a foreign news service for the projected paper from Louis Veuillot's Paris office, and at his suggestion the name of \"The Universe\" was chosen. Denis Lane undertook the printing, Mr. Dunn the editorship, and on 8 December 1860, the first Catholic penny paper in England was started.\n\nAt first it was strictly non-political. The editor and staff gave their services gratuitously, but even with this help expenses were greater than receipts. To attract a larger circulation political articles were inserted, which led to the resignation of the greater part of the staff. Mr. Lane then took over the paper and conducted it for many years as a Catholic paper, giving a general support to the Liberals and the Irish national cause. He had always a priest as \"theological editor\"; amongst those who thus assisted him were Father W. Eyre, S.J., Father Lockhart, and Cardinal Manning. The movement for the rescue of destitute Catholic children originated in \"The Universe\" office. It amalgamated with another paper, \"The Catholic Weekly\", founded to give a record of Catholic news without any party politics, thus reverting to its original programme.\n\n\"The Lamp\" was reorganized about the same time and had for some years a prosperous existence as a popular magazine. Fathers Rawes and Caswall, Lady Georgiana Fullerton, Augusta Theodosia Drane, Cecilia Caddell were among its contributors. In 1864 Miss Taylor founded \"The Month\", at first an illustrated magazine giving much of its space to fiction and the lighter forms of literature. When she founded her first community of nuns (Poor Servants of the Mother of God), her magazine passed to the Jesuits, under the editorship of the Father Henry J. Coleridge. It had many notable contributors, and in its pages Newman's \"Dream of Gerontius\" first appeared.\n\nNumerically, the main strength of English Catholicism has always been in the North, and after the foundation of \"The Universe\" several efforts were made to produce a Catholic penny paper in Lancashire. Three successive enterprises had a brief career. A fourth, a paper known as \"The Northern Press\" was barely existing, when, in 1867, it was taken over by Father James Nugent of Liverpool. He renamed it \"The Catholic Times\" and gradually made it the most widely circulated Catholic paper in England. Printed for many years by the boys of the refuge he had founded in Liverpool, when it became a profit-earning paper it helped support this work of charity. Offices were opened in Manchester and London. A special London edition was produced, and in 1878 a Christmas supplement issued under the title of \"The Catholic Fireside\" was so successful that it was continued as a monthly penny magazine; in 1893 it was made a weekly publication. \"The Catholic Times\" appealed largely to the Catholics of Irish descent in Great Britain, and championed the Irish Nationalist cause. P. L. Beazley directed it for many years.\n\nIn the sixties other papers were founded, for a while fairly prosperous, though they never won the established position of \"The Catholic Times\" and \"The Tablet\". \"The Weekly Register\" was a threepenny paper, of much the same character as \"The Tablet\", but favouring the Liberals and Nationalists. Later, under the editorship of Charles Kent and then of Wilfrid Meynell, it had a marked literary quality. \"The Weekly Register\" ceased to exist and with it \"The Westminster Gazette\", whose name is now that of a London evening paper. The \"Westminster\" was owned and edited by Pursell, afterwards biographer of Manning. During the months of newspaper controversy that preceded the definition of papal infallibility the \"Westminster\" was \"non-opportunist\", and Cardinal Vaughan, while he avoided all controversy on the subject in \"The Tablet\", contributed, week after week, letters to the \"Westminster\", combating its editorial views. It never had much circulation, and Vaughan was able a few years later to end its competition by buying and stopping it. Father Lockhart edited for some years \"Catholic Opinion\", a penny paper giving extracts from the Catholic press at home and abroad. After his death it was amalgamated with \"The Catholic Times\".\n\nCharles Diamond, for some time a member of the Irish Parliamentary party, started in 1884 \"The Irish Tribune\" in Newcastle upon Tyne. Shortly after, he purchased two other Catholic papers, the Glasgow \"Observer\" and the Preston \"Catholic News\", which were in difficulties for want of capital. He then formed the idea of working several papers from a common centre, much of the matter being common to all, but each appearing under a local title and having several columns of special matter of local interest. He issued the \"Catholic Herald\" from London, as the centre of the organization, and thirty-two other local weekly papers in various towns of England, Wales, and Scotland. He also produced on the same system ten different parish magazines and \"The Catholic Home Journal\", with which the old \"Lamp\" was amalgamated.\n\nThere were a considerable number of minor Catholic monthlies, mostly founded in recent years to advocate and promote special objects. The \"Annals of the Propagation of the Faith\" and \"illustrated Catholic Missions\" specialize on the news of the mission field. \"Catholic Book Notes\", a monthly issued by the Catholic Truth Society and edited by James Britten, was a record of current literature and reviews. \"The Second Spring\", edited by Father Philip Fletcher, was a record of the work of the Ransom League for the conversion of England. \"The Crucible\" was a monthly review of social work for Catholic women.\n\nDevotional magazines were issued by various religious orders, the most widely circulated of which was the \"Messenger of the Sacred Heart\", edited by the Jesuits. There were also several college magazines. In general circulations were quite low.\n\nThe Polish Catholic press reflected the political conditions of the empires that had annexed the territory of Poland. In Galicia, part of Austria-Hungary, it was considerably freer; in Imperial Russia and in the German Empire there was severe censorship of all Polish language periodicals. Greater development took place from 1831 to 1864 in the period of national insurrections against the occupying powers.\n\nOne of the oldest Polish publications in the Austrian Partition was the \"Czas\" (Time) daily, the organ of the Conservative party. Its publication began in 1848. In 1866 there appeared the \"Przegląd polski\" (Polish Review), which had from its beginning the collaboration of Count Stanisław Tarnowski and Stanisław Egbert Koźmian. The \"Czas\" and the \"Przegląd polski\" always maintained a strictly Catholic character. In 1867 Juliusz Starkla and Tadeusz Romanowicz established at Lemberg (Lwów) the \"Dziennik Literacki\" (Literary Journal), which had a short life; Jan Dobrzański founded the \"Gazeta Narodowa\" (National Gazette), to which was united in 1869 the \"Dziennik Polski\" (Polish Journal). In 1871 Rev. Edward Podolski established the \"Przegląd lwowski\" (Lemberg Review), which strenuously defended Catholic interests. In the same city there appeared the \"Gazeta Lwowska\" (Lemberg Gazette), the organ of the imperial viceroy in Galicia.\n\nIn 1884 the Polish Jesuits began at Kraków (Cracow) the publication of the \"Przegląd powszechny\" (Universal Review), covering scientific and literary points of view. In the same city from 1881 to 1886 there was published the \"Przegląd literacki i artystyczny\" (Literary and Artistic Review). In 1894 in the whole of Austria-Hungary there were 126 Polish periodicals and daily papers, of which 65 appeared at Lemberg (Lwów, in Polish) and 29 at Kraków. At Lemberg the daily papers were the \"Dziennik polski\", the \"Gazeta lwowska\", the \"Gazeta narodowa\", the \"Kurjer Lwowski\", and the \"Przegląd\". There were two Catholic weeklies, the \"Gazeta katolicka\" and the \"Tygodnik katolicki\".\n\nThe \"Gazeta kościelna\" (Ecclesiastical Gazette), representative of the Catholic press, was a small semi-weekly, poor in doctrine and immersed in politics. From the scientific standpoint the most important periodical was the \"Kwaltarnik hystoryczny\" (Tri-monthly historical periodical), which began publication in 1886. Also important were the \"Pamiętniki literackie\" (Literary Memoirs), the \"Ateneum polskie\", the \"Kosmos\" (the organ of the society of naturalists of Lemberg), and the \"Nasz kraj\".\n\nAt Kraków, besides the \"Czas\", there were the \"Nowa Reforma\" and the \"Głos narodu\" (Voice of the People), an organ of the clergy and of the militant Catholic party. The Socialists published there the \"Naprzód\" (Forward), the official organ of their party, and the monthly periodical \"Krytyka\". In following years there has been established the \"Świat Słowiański\" (Slavic World), the organ of the Slav club of Kraków, containing valuable information relating to the various Slavic countries. The Academy of Sciences of Kraków published a \"Bulletin international\", monthly; and the \"Rozprawy\" (Dissertations) of mathematics, physics, and biology. Daily papers and periodicals were published also in the other Galician cities of Tarnów, Rzeszów, Sambor, Stanisławów, Jarosław, and Przemyśl.\n\nOne of the oldest Polish daily papers in Prussia was the \"Dziennik poznański\" (Posen Journal), established in 1859. From 1845 to 1865 there appeared the \"Przegląd poznański\", an ardent defender of Catholicism, edited by Rev. Jan Koźmian; in 1860 Rev. Jan Prusinowski published the \"Tygodnik katolicki\" (illustrated weekly). In 1865 Ludwik Rzepecki began the publication of the scientific periodical \"Oświata\" (Culture), which, however, had only a short life, and was followed by the \"Przegląd Wielkopolski\" (Review of Greater Poland), edited by Emil Kierski. In 1870 Edmond Callier founded the \"Tygodnik Wielkopolski\", to which leading Polish writers contributed. The \"Kurjer Poznański\", established by Teodor Żychliński in 1872, also acquired great importance. In 1894 there were published in Prussia and in the Grand Duchy of Posen the following daily papers: the \"Dziennik poznański\", the \"Goniec wielkopolski\", the \"Kurjer poznański\", the nationalist \"Orędownik\" (Advocate), and the \"Wielkopolanin\". The \"Przegląd poznański\" resumed its publications under the direction of Władysław Rabski, while other daily papers were published at Danzig (Gdańsk), Thorn (Toruń), Pelplin, and Allenstein (Olsztyn).\n\nIn 1841 the publication of the \"Biblioteka Warszawska\", a monthly periodical dedicated especially to literature, began in Russian Poland. There were published in Warsaw the \"Dzień\" (Day); the \"Dziennik powszechny\" (Universal Journal); the \"Głos Warszawski\" (Voice of Warsaw); \"Głos poranny\" (Voice of Morning); the \"Kurjer polski\"; \"Kurjer Warszawski\"; \"Nowa Gazeta\"; \"Przegląd poranny\"; \"Wiadomości Codzienne\" (Daily News); \"Słowo\" (Word), a nationalist paper that had great influence; and the \"Warszawska Gazeta\". Other dailies were published at Lublin, Kiev (\"Dziennik kijowski\"), at Vilna (\"Kurjer litewski\" and \"Goniec Wilenski\") at Łódź and at St. Petersburg. Among the periodicals, besides the \"Biblioteka Warszawska\", were the \"Biesiada literacka\" (Literary Banquet), splendidly illustrated; the \"Kultura\", hostile to religiocity; the \"Przegląd filozoficzny\" (Philosophical Review), a quarterly publication; the \"Przegląd historyczny\" (Historical Review), scientific, twice monthly; the \"Świat\" (World), an illustrated weekly; and the \"Tygodnik illustrowany\". The Catholic press was represented by the \"Przegląd katolicki\", of Warsaw, a publication dedicated to politics. This paper was the one most read by the clergy. Count Roger Łubieński (\"hrabia\") established the \"Wiara\" (Faith), a weekly devoted to ecclesiastical news; and these two publications were later united into one. A scientifically important periodical, the \"Kwartalnik teologiczny\", lasted only a few years. By the early twentieth century, of the daily papers or periodicals for the clergy, or having a strictly Catholic programme, those most read were: the \"Polak katolik\"; the \"Myśl katolicka\", of Częstochowa; and the \"Atheneum kapłańskie\", of the seminary of Włocławek, a monthly scientific publication.\n\nIn 1864 Polish exiles established the \"Ojczyna\" (Native Land) at Leipzig, the \"Przyszłość\" (The Future) at Paris, and the \"Przeglad powszechny\" at Dresden. At Chicago, U.S.A., the chief centre of Polish emigration, were published the \"Dziennik chicagoski\", the \"Dzien swiety\" (Holy Day), the \"Gazeta katolicka\", the \"Gazeta polska\", the \"Nowe Zycie\" (New Life), the \"Sztandar\", \"Tygodnik naukowo-powiesciowy\", \"Wiara i ojczyna\", \"Zgoda\", and \"Ziarno\", a musical publication. Other papers were published at Milwaukee, Buffalo, N.Y., New York City, Detroit, Philadelphia, Winona, Cleveland, Ohio, Toledo, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Stevens Point, Manitowoc, Mahanoy City, and Wilkes-Barre. Brazil also had a Polish publication.\n\n"}

Its current priority is the completion of audio-visual profiles for the c. 17,000 species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n\nThe project is an initiative of Wildscreen, a UK-registered educational charity, based in Bristol. The technical platform was created by Hewlett Packard, as part of the HP Labs' Digital Media Systems research programme.\n\nARKive has the backing of leading conservation organisations, including BirdLife International, Conservation International, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), The United Nations' World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), as well as leading academic and research institutions, such as the Natural History Museum; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; and the Smithsonian Institution. It is a member of the Institutional Council of the Encyclopedia of Life.\n\nTwo ARKive layers for Google Earth, featuring endangered species and species in the Gulf of Mexico have been produced by Google Earth Outreach. The first of these was launched in April 2008 by Wildscreen's Patron, Sir David Attenborough.\n\nThe project formally was launched on 20 May 2003 by its patron, the UK-based natural history presenter, Sir David Attenborough, a long-standing colleague and friend of its chief instigator, the late Christopher Parsons, a former Head of the BBC Natural History Unit. Parsons never lived to see the fruition of the project, succumbing to cancer in November 2002 at the age of 70.\n\nParsons identified a need to provide a centralised safe haven for wildlife films and photographs after discovering that many such records are held in scattered, non-indexed, collections, often with little or no public access, and sometimes in conditions that could lead to loss or damage. He believed the records could be a powerful force in building environmental awareness by bringing scientific names to life. He also saw their preservation as an important educational resource and conservation tool, not least because extinction rates and habitat destruction could mean that images and sounds might be the only legacy of some species’ existence.\n\nHis vision of a permanent, accessible, refuge for audio-visual wildlife material won almost immediate support from many of the world’s major broadcasters, including the BBC, Granada, international state broadcasting corporations and \"National Geographic\" magazine; leading film and photographic libraries, international conservation organisations and academic institutes such as Cornell University.\n\nThe initial feasibility study for creating ARKive was carried out in the late 1980s by conservationist John Burton, but at the time the costs of the technology needed were too far too high, and so it was over a decade later, after the technology had caught up with Christopher Parson's vision (and the costs dropped), that the project was able to get off the ground.\n\nAfter capital development funds of £2m were secured from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 1997 and New Opportunities Fund in 2000, work on building ARKive began as part of the UK's Millennium celebrations, using advanced computerised storage and retrieval technology devised for the project by Hewlett-Packard., with an initial capacity of up to 74 terabytes of data, using redundant hardware and multiple copies of media stored at multiple sites. Media is digitised to the highest available quality without compression and encoded to open standards.\n\nA prototype site was online as early as April 1999. There were several design iterations before the formal launch.\n\nBy the launch date, the project team had researched, catalogued, copied, described and authenticated image, sound and fact files of 1,000 animals, plants and fungi, many of them critically endangered. More multi-media profiles are added every month, starting with British flora and fauna and with species included on the Red List – that is, species that are believed to be closest to extinction, according to research by the World Conservation Union. By January 2006, the database had grown to 2,000 species, 15,000 still images and more than 50 hours of video. By 2010, over 5,500 donors had contributed 70,000 film clips and photos of more than 12,000 species.\n\nThe site was Sunday Times website of the year for 2005. It was a 2010 Webby Award honoree for its outstanding calibre of work, in the 'Education' category, and a 2010 Association of Educational Publishers 'Distinguished Achievement Award' winner, in the category for websites for 9-12 year olds.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5607383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5607383", "title": "Acquainted with the Night (book)", "text": "Acquainted with the Night (book)\n\nAcquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark (or \"Acquainted with the Night: A Celebration of the Dark Hours\") is a non-fiction book by Christopher Dewdney about various aspects of night. It was first published in 2004 by HarperCollins. It uses the same title as the Robert Frost poem \"Acquainted with the Night\". The book consists of 14 chapters, with one chapter dedicated to each hour of the night, from 6 pm to 5 am. Mini-essays populate each chapter which each follow a theme, like nocturnal creatures, dreams, astronomy, and mythology. Other subjects and topics touched upon include science, art, culture, natural history, superstitions, and psychology. The book was a finalist for the 2004 Governor General's Awards and for the 2005 Charles Taylor Prize. It tied with \"Dark Matter: Reading The Bones\" for the World Fantasy Award in Anthologies.\n\nAt the time of \"Acquainted with the Night\"'s writing, author and poet Christopher Dewdney was 52 years old and living in Toronto with his wife, Barbara Gowdy. He had previously written 14 books, the last being the 2002 book of poetry, \"The Natural History\". His previous non-fiction books were \"Last Flesh: Life in the Transhuman Era\" (1998) on the impacts of technological advances on humanism, \"The Secular Grail: Paradigms of Perception\" (1993) regarding the human psyche, and \"The Immaculate Perception\" (1986) on his views of consciousness, language and dreams. Dewdney's past books were described as being \"more admired than read\". On the topic of 'the night', he had a lifelong fascination with nightlife and eventually decided to write a book about it. He quickly became overwhelmed by the amount of information relating to the subject. For research, he consulted a variety of genres and formats, including books, journals, magazines, music, and movies, and collected information within the broad topics of art, science, social sciences and history. The perspective Dewdney took was that of \"explaining night to beings from another planet that had two opposed suns and no night at all\".\n\nThe content is divided into 14 chapters. The first chapter serves as an introduction and considers the mythological and geological origin of night. The next 12 chapters are each titled after an hour starting with chapter 2's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13's 5 am. Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night, including sunsets, the green flash, the stages of twilight, as well as Olbers' paradox, and a definition of the size and speed of night. The 7 pm chapter deals with nature at night, how animals see and hear differently at night with a focus on bats, nighthawks, and nocturnal insects. The 8 pm chapter analyzes children's literature and bedtime stories. The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night, including the evolution of nightclubs, street lights, and the impacts of light pollution. The 10 pm chapter discusses night festivals around the world and throughout history. The 11 pm chapter explains the circadian rhythm and the physiology of sleep and dreams.\n\nThe 12 am chapter traces the history behind dream interpretation from Gilgamesh to Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Calvin Hall. Here, Dewdney considers nightmares and takes sudden unexplained death syndrome, whose sufferers are almost always Asian males, between 20 and 49 years old, as an extreme example of nightmares that cause the dreamer to die from a \"ventricular fibrillation...brought about by extreme terror\". The 1 am chapter compares literary and mythological personifications of, or beings associated with, the night. The 2 am chapter tells the stories of the legends behind the moon and the constellations. The 3 am chapter is all about insomnia. The 4 am chapter provides a geographical aspect, touring the places with long nights, like Las Vegas, caves, the poles, and deep within the oceans. The 5 am chapter discusses artistic representations of night, especially in music, on film and through paintings. The final chapter is a conclusion in which Dewdney reflects on memorable sunrises he has experienced and contrasts sunrises with sunsets.\n\nThe title shares its name with the Robert Frost poem Acquainted with the Night, which is quoted on the first page. The book's structure uses twelve chapters, equating to twelve hours of night, from 6 pm to 5 am. Two additional chapters, \"First Night\" and \"Night's Last Stand\", bookend the twelve chapters as an introduction and conclusion. This hour-by-hour structure was used to move the narrative along logically while jumping between diverse topics. The topics range from such disparate subjects as culture, superstitions, natural history, physiology, and psychology so that reviewers variously called the book \"a compendium\", \"a browser's book\" and full of \"encyclopedic mini-essays\". Autobiographical passages are also included. One reviewer noted the format uses personal observations that lead to discussions of broad subjects with \"side trips into relevant supporting materials\".\n\nThe reviewer for the \"Quill & Quire\" cited the book as an example of a subgenre which an article in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" dubbed \"mundane studies\" referring to the ubiquity of the subject, like Mark Kurlansky's \"\" and Witold Rybczynski's \"One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw\". Dewdney's writing in \"Acquainted with the Night\" combines a poet's point of view with an interest for the sciences. The tone was described as \"boyish enthusiasm\" and \"highly condensed yet personable voice\". Gisèle Baxter, in the journal \"Canadian Literature\", wrote that the its tone was set at the beginning of the book by \"an anecdote of a small boy creeping into the moonlit, partly wooded backyard of his family home\".\n\n\"Acquainted with the Night: Excursions through the World After Dark\" was published as a hardback in Canada by HarperCollins in May 2004. In the United States, Bloomsbury published the hardback version in July 2004 as \"Acquainted with the Night: A Celebration of the Dark Hours\". The trade paperback version was published by HarperCollins in March 2005. An excerpt was published in the Canadian literary magazine \"Geist\". The book was nominated for the 2005 Charles Taylor Prize, awarded to the best Canadian work of literary non-fiction, and Dewdney was a finalist in the English-language non-fiction category of the Governor General's Awards. The \"Library Journal\" noted the book would be \"most useful for larger public libraries\".\n\nRegarding Dewdney's writing, the reviewer for \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote that Dewdney writes carefully and \"confidently\". Another reviewer called the book \"engaging and recreational\". Gisèle Baxter, in \"Canadian Literature\", found his use of language \"provok[es] consideration through its elegant turns of phrase and image\" and Laura Wright, in \"Discover\" called the imagery \"arresting\". In \"The Globe and Mail\", poet and novelist Margaret Atwood wrote, \"The prose moves from the strictly informative to the lyrical to the charming to the amusing to the odd to the strangely moving without batting an eye.\" Another reviewer noted Dewdney \"combined a deft lyric touch with a deep interest in science\". The reviewer for \"Canadian Geographic\" wrote that \"the strength of the book is in its artful mix of science and poetry\". Literary critic Sven Birkerts found Dewdney to be \"an engaging enough narrator and solid, enthusiastic stylist\". The book's structure received mixed reviews, some reviewers found Dewdney was able to effectively transition between various topics while other reviewers did not. Birkerts wrote the book has \"a fun-facts-fished-from-the-data-ocean...[and] end-of-term crammer\" sense to it.

{"id": "236334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236334", "title": "Amicus curiae", "text": "Amicus curiae\n\nAn amicus curiae (literally, \"friend of the court\"; plural, amici curiae) is someone who is not a party to a case and may or may not have been solicited by a party and who assists a court by offering information, expertise, or insight that has a bearing on the issues in the case; and is typically presented in the form of a brief. The decision on whether to consider an amicus brief lies within the discretion of the court. The phrase \"amicus curiae\" is legal Latin. \n\nThe \"amicus curiae\" figure originates in Roman law. Starting in the 9th century, it was incorporated into English law, and it was later extended to most common law systems. Later, it was introduced in international law, in particular concerning human rights. From there, it was integrated in some civil law systems (it has recently been integrated into Argentina's law system and Honduras's 2010 civil procedures code). Today, it is used by the European Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.\n\nThe role of an \"amicus\" is often confused with that of an intervener. The role of an \"amicus\" is, as stated by Salmon LJ (as Lord Salmon then was) in \"Allen v Sir Alfred McAlpine & Sons Ltd\" [1968] 2 QB 229 at p. 266 F-G:\n\nThe situation most often noted in the press is when an advocacy group files a brief in a case before an appellate court in which it is not a litigant. Appellate cases are normally limited to the factual record and arguments coming from the lower court case under appeal; attorneys focus on the facts and arguments most favorable to their clients. Where a case may have broader implications, \"amicus curiae\" briefs are a way to articulate those concerns, so that the possibly broad legal or public policy ramifications of the court's anticipated decisions will not depend solely on the positions and arguments advanced by the parties directly involved in the case.\n\nIn prominent cases, \"amici curiae\" are generally organizations with sizable legal budgets. In the United States, for example, non-profit legal advocacy organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Landmark Legal Foundation, the Pacific Legal Foundation, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Center for Law and Justice or NORML, frequently submit such briefs to advocate for or against a particular legal change or interpretation. If a decision could affect an entire industry, companies other than the litigants may wish to have their concerns heard. In the United States, federal courts often hear cases involving the constitutionality of state laws. Hence states may file briefs as \"amici curiae\" when their laws or interests are likely to be affected, as in the Supreme Court case \"McDonald v. Chicago,\" when thirty-two states under the aegis of Texas (and California independently) filed such briefs.\n\n\"Amici curiae\" who do not file briefs often present an academic perspective on the case. For example, if the law gives deference to a history of legislation of a certain topic, a historian may choose to evaluate the claim from specialized expertise. An economist, statistician, or sociologist may choose to do the same. Newspaper editorials, blogs, and other opinion pieces arguably have the capability to influence Supreme Court decisions as \"de facto amici curiae\". They are not, however, technically considered \"amicus curiae,\" as they do not submit materials to the Court, do not need to ask for leave, and have no guarantee that they will be read.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has special rules for \"amicus curiae\" briefs sought to be filed in cases pending before it. Supreme Court Rule 37 states, in part, such a brief should cover \"relevant matter\" not dealt with by the parties which \"may be of considerable help\". The cover of an \"amicus\" brief must identify which party the brief is supporting, or if the brief supports only affirmance or reversal. The Court also requires that, \"inter alia\", all non-governmental amici identify those providing a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of the brief. Briefs must be prepared in booklet format, and 40 copies must be served with the Court.\n\nIn the United States Supreme Court, unless the \"amicus\" brief is being filed by the federal government (or one of its officers or agents) or a U.S. state, permission of the court (by means of motion for leave) or mutual consent of the parties is generally required. Allowing an \"amicus curiae\" to present oral argument is considered \"extraordinary\". The court can also appoint its own \"amicus curiae\" if neither party supports the decision of the lower court, which it has done at least 43 times.\n\nThe role of \"amicus curiae\" briefs in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system is controversial. The controversy arises due to the governmental nature of WTO disputes. As only WTO members have access to the system, any non-members such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are excluded and have no right to be heard. Thus the only way for them to contribute to a WTO decision is through \"amicus curiae\" briefs. To date there is a divergence in approaches in the WTO as to the admissibility of such briefs.\n\nThe first WTO case to comprehensively examine the admissibility of \"amicus curiae\" briefs was US – Shrimp. The case concerned a ban by the US on imports of all shrimp and shrimp products not caught with turtle excluder devices. The panel at first instance rejected the two \"amicus curiae\" briefs that were submitted by environmental groups, on the basis they were not expressly solicited by the panel under Article 13 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding of the WTO. This was overturned by the Appellate Body who held a panel had authority to accept, consider or reject briefs under Articles 12 and 13 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding regardless of whether they were expressly solicited.\n\nThe issue was re-examined in US – Lead and Bismuth II which concerned the imposition of duties by the US on certain imported hot rolled lead and bismuth carbon steel from the UK. The Panel at first instance affirmed the position in the US – Shrimp case and accepted two \"amicus curiae\" briefs that were submitted. On appeal, the Appellate Body relied on Article 17.9 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding and Rule 16(1) of the Working Procedures for Appellate Review to create rules to accept \"amicus curiae\" briefs. This was deemed as the source of legal authority to accept such briefs by an Appellate Body.\n\nThe next significant case to deal with \"amicus curiae\" briefs was EC – Asbestos, where the French government banned domestically produced and imported asbestos products. Of the five \"amicus curiae\" briefs received by the Panel, only two that were submitted by the European Community, were accepted. The panel did not provide any explanation as to why they were accepted or rejected. On appeal, the Appellate Body relied on Rule 16(1) of the \"Working Procedures for Appellate Review\" to create additional procedures to deal with the \"amicus curiae\" briefs. Of the 11 briefs submitted, the Appellate Body accepted none on the basis they failed to comply with these additional procedures.\n\n\n"}

The current version of the deed of gift is the third revision of the original deed. The original deed was written in 1852 and forwarded to the New York Yacht Club on July 8, 1857.\n\nThe surviving members of the syndicate which owned the yacht \"America\", the first winner of what would become the America's Cup (née “Royal Yacht Squadron Cup” or the “RYS Cup for One Hundred Sovereigns”), donated the America's Cup through a deed of gift to the New York Yacht Club on July 8, 1857. The cup would be held in trust as a “challenge trophy\" to promote friendly competition among nations, with the deed of gift being the primary instrument governing the rules to make a valid challenge for the America’s Cup and the rules of conduct of the races.\n\nAfter the 1881 Cup match, the New York Yacht Club officially returned the Cup to George L. Schuyler, the sole surviving member of the syndicate that owned \"America\" to rewrite the deed to discourage inland-based yacht clubs from challenging the Cup. This revised Deed incorporated, among other things, the following rules: the challenger’s yacht club's annual regatta must take place on the sea or on an arm of the sea, and the challenging boat must sail to the site of the contest on her own bottom, as the yacht \"America\" did when first winning the cup in England.\n\nIn 1887, the challenging yacht’s hull was much longer than originally stated by the challenger, a potential advantage. The difference alarmed the N.Y.Y.C., but they rectified the situation by handicapping the challenger. Although the N.Y.Y.C. successfully defended the Cup that year, the problem spurred them to rewrite the Deed. Once again the club officially returned the Cup to Schuyler. The third Deed is much longer and couched in legal terminology. The third Deed tightened the rules for challenging; for example, it stated explicitly that the challenger must not exceed the dimensions provided to the holder of the Cup. The new version of the rules created an uproar among many British yachtsmen, who claimed that the new rules made it impossible to challenge. No one challenged until six years later, when British railroad tycoon James Lloyd Ashbury set forth his first of two challenges.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the N.Y.Y.C. amended the Deed by changing the requirement regarding waterline length: the minimum waterline length was reduced from to to allow the use of the 12-metre class. In addition, the rule that the challenging boat had to sail on her own bottom to the site of the match was eliminated, permitting boats to be shipped to the venue without requiring them to be able to sail across oceans (or contain living accommodations).\n\nIn 1985 a second amendment was made to allow for matches to take place during the summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe Deed of Gift is a registered Trust document in the New York Supreme Court in Manhattan (New York County), New York City, New York, which is a court of first instance, unlike supreme courts of other jurisdictions. An interpretation of the document, when contested, can be taken before that Court for clarification on whether the Deed of Gift's terms and conditions (as written by George L. Schuyler) are being met.\n\nThe wording of the deed is comparatively straightforward but written in the legal language, style and terminology of the time it was written. In later years this has given rise to disputes relating to the meaning of particular phrases and words and clarified or further confused by taking a view on what the donor actually intended when the deed was written.\n\nThere have been two instances of litigation regarding interpretation appealed to the New York Court of Appeals, that state's highest court. The first concerned the challenge for the 1988 America's Cup, where the question was first, whether the Mercury Bay Boating Club was a valid challenger and if the San Diego Yacht Club had to accept their challenge; and second, whether the Defender's boat (a catamaran) complied with the terms of the Deed of Gift. The answer was yes to both questions.\n\nThe second concerned Société Nautique de Genève, the defender of the 2010 America's Cup, where the question was whether a valid challenge could be accepted by the defender from a 'shell' yacht club that was formed for the specific purpose of challenging and had not previously held a properly constituted annual regatta on an ocean water course or an arm of the sea. The court's answer was no. There were subsequently a number of additional issues raised regarding the type of boat to be used, the venue and other points which were put to the court by the court adjudicated valid challenger Golden Gate Yacht Club. All were upheld by the court with the exception of two issues which were open and still awaiting court decisions even after the completion of the 2010 America's Cup races but both sides agreed to drop all outstanding legal actions soon after.\n"}

{"id": "610868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=610868", "title": "DjVu", "text": "DjVu\n\nDjVu ( , like French \"déjà vu\") is a computer file format designed primarily to store scanned documents, especially those containing a combination of text, line drawings, indexed color images, and photographs. It uses technologies such as image layer separation of text and background/images, progressive loading, arithmetic coding, and lossy compression for bitonal (monochrome) images. This allows high-quality, readable images to be stored in a minimum of space, so that they can be made available on the web.\n\nDjVu has been promoted as providing smaller files than PDF for most scanned documents. The DjVu developers report that color magazine pages compress to 40–70 kB, black-and-white technical papers compress to 15–40 kB, and ancient manuscripts compress to around 100 kB; a satisfactory JPEG image typically requires 500 kB. Like PDF, DjVu can contain an OCR text layer, making it easy to perform copy and paste and text search operations.\n\nFree creators, manipulators, converters, browser plug-ins, and desktop viewers are available. DjVu is supported by a number of multi-format document viewers and e-book reader software on Linux (Okular, Evince) and Windows (SumatraPDF).\n\nThe DjVu technology was originally developed by Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Patrick Haffner, and Paul G. Howard at AT&T Labs from 1996 to 2001.\n\nDue to its declared higher compression ratio (and thus smaller file size) and the ease of converting large volumes of text into DjVu format, and because it is an open file format, it has been considered superior to PDF. Independent technologist Brewster Kahle in a 2004 talk on IT Conversations discussed the benefits of allowing easier access to DjVu files.\n\nThe DjVu library distributed as part of the open-source package \"DjVuLibre\" has become the reference implementation for the DjVu format. DjVuLibre has been maintained and updated by the original developers of DjVu since 2002.\n\nThe DjVu file format specification has gone through a number of revisions, the most recent being from 2005.\n\nThe primary usage of the DjVu format has been the electronic distribution of documents with a quality comparable to that of printed documents. As that niche is also the primary usage for PDF, it was inevitable that the two formats would become competitors. It should however be observed that the two formats approach the problem of delivering high resolution documents in very different ways: PDF primarily encodes graphics and text as vectorised data, whereas DjVu primarily encodes them as pixmap images. This means PDF places the burden of rendering the document on the reader, whereas DjVu places that burden on the creator.\n\nDuring a number of years, significantly overlapping with the period when DjVu was being developed, there were no PDF viewers for free operating systems — a particular stumbling block was the rendering of vectorised fonts, which are essential for combining small file size with high resolution in PDF. Since displaying DjVu was a simpler problem for which free software was available, there were suggestions that the free software movement should employ DjVu instead of PDF for distributing documentation; rendering for creating DjVu is in principle not much different from rendering for a device-specific printer driver, and DjVu can as a last resort be generated from scans of paper media. However when FreeType 2.0 in 2000 began provide rendering of all major vectorised font formats, that specific advantage of DjVu began to erode.\n\nIn the 2000s, with the growth of the world wide web and before widespread adoption of broadband, DjVu was often adopted by digital libraries as their format of choice, thanks to its integration with software like Greenstone and the Internet Archive, browser plugins which allowed advanced online browsing, smaller file size for comparable quality of book scans and other image-heavy documents and support for embedding and searching full text from OCR.\nSome features such as the thumbnail previews were later integrated in the Internet Archive's BookReader and DjVu browsing was deprecated in its favour as around 2015 some major browsers stopped supporting Java applets and DjVu plugins with them.\n\nThe DjVu file format is based on the Interchange File Format and is composed of hierarchically organized chunks. The IFF structure is preceded by a 4-byte codice_1 magic number. Following is a single codice_2 chunk with a secondary identifier of either codice_3 or codice_4 for a single-page or a multi-page document, respectively.\n\nDjVu divides a single image into many different images, then compresses them separately. To create a DjVu file, the initial image is first separated into three images: a background image, a foreground image, and a mask image. The background and foreground images are typically lower-resolution color images (e.g., 100 dpi); the mask image is a high-resolution bilevel image (e.g., 300 dpi) and is typically where the text is stored. The background and foreground images are then compressed using a wavelet-based compression algorithm named IW44. The mask image is compressed using a method called JB2 (similar to JBIG2). The JB2 encoding method identifies nearly identical shapes on the page, such as multiple occurrences of a particular character in a given font, style, and size. It compresses the bitmap of each unique shape separately, and then encodes the locations where each shape appears on the page. Thus, instead of compressing a letter \"e\" in a given font multiple times, it compresses the letter \"e\" once (as a compressed bit image) and then records every place on the page it occurs.\n\nOptionally, these shapes may be mapped to UTF-8 codes (either by hand or potentially by a text recognition system) and stored in the DjVu file. If this mapping exists, it is possible to select and copy text.\n\nSince JBIG2 was based on JB2, both compression methods have the same problems when performing lossy compression. Numbers may be substituted with similarly looking numbers (such as replacing 6 with 8) if the text was scanned at a low resolution prior to lossy compression.\n\nDjVu is an open file format with patents. The file format specification is published, as well as source code for the reference library. The original authors distribute an open-source implementation named \"DjVuLibre\" under the GNU General Public License. The rights to the commercial development of the encoding software have been transferred to different companies over the years, including AT&T Corporation, LizardTech, \"Celartem\" and \"Cuminas\".\n\nCelartem acquired LizardTech and Extensis.\n\nDespite its advantages, DjVu is not widely supported by scanning and viewing software. While viewers can be downloaded, opening DjVu files is not implemented in most operating systems by default.\n\nIn 2002, the DjVu file format was chosen by the Internet Archive as a format in which its \"Million Book Project\" provides scanned public-domain books online (along with TIFF and PDF).\n\nWikimedia Commons, a media repository used by Wikipedia among others, conditionally permits PDF and DjVu media files.\n\nThird party tools using APIs and SDKs can create and manipulate DjVu files.\n\nA JavaScript based library can read DjVu files online.\n\n\n"}

Ferguson (1970, 1976), who posited a number of phonological and morphosyntactic features that were found widely across Ethiopia, which then included Eritrea, including the Ethio-Semitic, Cushitic and Omotic languages but not the Nilo-Saharan languages. \n\nOthers scholars have since pointed out smaller areas of shared features within the larger area (Appleyard 1989, Breeze 1988, Sasse 1986, Tosco 1994, Wedekind 1989).\n\nOne of area's most notable features seems to be the use of the verb \"say\" as an inflected dummy element for an uninflected lexical base (Appleyard 2001, Cohen \"et al.\" 2002). Hayward also pointed out patterns of lexicalisation as evidence of a shared linguistic unity across the area (1999, 2000), and Treis noted further examples (2010).\n\nThough Tosco earlier accepted that the area's status had \"long been well established\" (1994:415), he later challenged Ferguson's work as flawed (2000). He concludes that the Ethiopian language area is not valid and suggests that Ferguson's work reflects the politics of his time, when there was a strong emphasis on Ethiopian unity, as reflected in Donald N. Levine's book \"Greater Ethiopia: The Evolution of a Multiethnic Society.\"\n\nBaye Yiman has shown evidence of pragmatic similarities among languages of the Ethiopian language area (1997).\n\nGüldemann has proposed that the use of a generic auxiliary is an area feature that includes Ethiopia but also other languages to its west and northwest. Similarly, Cohen, Simeone-Senelle, and Vanhove have examined the grammaticalised use of \"say\" and \"do\" as an area feature of what the scholars call \"East Africa\".\n\nWu Tong has examined prenominal relative clauses as an areal feature in the Ethiopian language area. \n\nTolemariam Fufa Teso has done a broad comparative study of verbal derivation across the area.\n\nThe existence of the area is still debated.\n\n\n"}

Through time the Library has changed locations within Salt Lake City as follows:\n\nThe current library building, just west of Temple Square was opened on October 23, 1985, and cost $8.2 million.\n\nIn 1938 the Genealogical Society of Utah began to microfilm records which contained genealogical data from around the world, and today this microfilm makes up much of the library's collection. Today the Genealogical Society of Utah is more commonly known as FamilySearch, and is currently working on digitizing many of its microfilm collections to be shared online.\n\nIts main purpose is to fulfill one of the LDS Church fundamental tenets: that deceased family members, especially ancestors, can be baptized by proxy, as well as receive other saving ordinances. These ordinances are performed in temples. As its collection has grown, however, more individuals throughout the world are using the collection to research their ancestry and chart their genealogy.\n\nThe library is in Salt Lake City, Utah, where the headquarters of the LDS Church are located. It is the largest genealogical library in the world and is open to the general public at no charge. The library holds genealogical records for over 110 countries, territories, and possessions. Its collections include over 1.6 million rolls of microfilmed records onsite and access the total collection of more than 2.4 million rolls of microfilmed genealogical records; 727,000 microfiche; 356,000 books, serials, and other formats; 4,500 periodicals; 3,725 electronic resources including subscriptions to the major genealogical websites.\n\nThe library offers research assistance to help patrons trace their own family history. Professional genealogists and volunteers offer assistance in about 30 languages, which includes reading and translating genealogically relevant documents. The library also offers free one-on-one consultations on difficult research problems. Additionally, there are classes on genealogical research topics free to the public and classes available online. Free family history research advice and information are offered online at the FamilySearch Research Wiki.\n\nThe library is in the process of digitizing much of its microfilm collection. An online index to some of the records is also being created. Volunteers to the project are now being actively solicited at FamilySearchIndexing.org. The searchable database containing the digital images and index will be available through the church's FamilySearch website. \n\nBranches of the library are called Family History Centers (FHC). While there are over 4,400 family history centers operating in more than 134 countries there are only about 17 major regional branch library class facilities. The others are ward, branch and stake facilities with at least one or more genealogical computers. For details, see Family History Center (LDS Church). Most of the microfilms in the main library's collection can be loaned to a family history center for a nominal charge. These centers are staffed by volunteers, and, like the main library, are free of charge and open to the public (LDS Church members and nonmembers alike).\n\nOn April 15, 1999, 70-year-old Sergei Babarin entered the Library's lobby and began shooting. A security guard and one female patron were killed while several others were injured. One hour and 45 minutes after the shooting began, Salt Lake police shot and fatally wounded Babarin in an exchange of gunfire.

{"id": "2322898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2322898", "title": "Getaddrinfo", "text": "Getaddrinfo\n\nThe functions getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() convert domain names, hostnames, and IP addresses between human-readable text representations and structured binary formats for the operating system's networking API. Both functions are contained in the POSIX standard application programming interface (API).\n\ngetaddrinfo and getnameinfo are inverse functions of each other. They are network protocol agnostic, and support both IPv4 and IPv6. It is the recommended interface for name resolution in building protocol independent applications and for transitioning legacy IPv4 code to the IPv6 Internet.\n\nInternally, the functions perform resolutions using the Domain Name System (DNS) by calling other, lower level functions, such as gethostbyname().\n\nOn February 16 2016 a security bug was announced in the glibc implementation of getaddrinfo(), using a buffer overflow technique, that may allow execution of arbitrary code by the attacker.\n\nThe C data structure used to represent addresses and hostnames within the networking API is the following:\nIn some older systems the type of \"ai_addrlen\" is \"size_t\" instead of \"socklen_t\". Most socket functions, such as \"accept()\" and \"getpeername()\", require the parameter to have type \"socklen_t * \" and programmers often pass the address to the \"ai_addrlen\" element of the \"addrinfo\" structure. If the types are incompatible, e.g., on a 64-bit Solaris 9 system where \"size_t\" is 8 bytes and \"socklen_t\" is 4 bytes, then run-time errors may result.\n\nThe structure contains structures \"ai_family\" and \"sockaddr\" with its own \"sa_family\" field. These are set to the same value when the structure is created with function \"getaddrinfo\" in some implementations.\n\ngetaddrinfo() converts human-readable text strings representing hostnames or IP addresses into a dynamically allocated linked list of struct addrinfo structures.\nThe function prototypes for these functions are specified as follows:\n\nAlthough implementations vary among platforms, the function first attempts to obtain a port number usually by branching on \"service\". If the string value is a number, it converts it to an integer and calls \"htons()\". If it is a service name, such as \"www\", the service is lookup with \"getservbyname()\", using the protocol derived from \"hints->ai_socktype\" as the second parameter to that function. Then, if \"hostname\" is given (not NULL), a call to \"gethostbyname()\" resolves it, or otherwise the address \"0.0.0.0\" is used, if \"hints->ai_flags\" is set to \"AI_PASSIVE\", and \"127.0.0.1\" otherwise. It allocated a new \"addrinfo\" structure filled with the appropriate \"sockaddr_in\" in one of these conditions and also adds the port retrieved at the beginning to it. Finally, the \"**res\" parameter is dereferenced to make it point to a newly allocated \"addrinfo\" structure. In some implementations, such as the Unix version for Mac OS, the \"hints->ai_protocol \" overrides the \"hints->ai_socktype\" value while in others it is the opposite, so both need to be defined with equivalent values for the code to be work across multiple platforms.\n\n\"getnameinfo()\" converts the internal binary representation of an IP address in the form of a \"struct sockaddr\" pointer into text strings consisting of the hostname or, if the address cannot be resolved into a name, a textual IP address representation, as well as the service port name or number. The function prototype is specified as follows:\nThis function frees the memory allocated by the \"getaddrinfo()\" function. As the result of the latter is a linked list of addrinfo structures, \" freeaddrinfo()\" loops through the list and frees each one in turn.\n\n\nThe following example uses \"getaddrinfo()\" to resolve the domain name \"www.example.com\" into its list of addresses and then calls \"getnameinfo()\" on each result to return the canonical name for the address. In general, this produces the original hostname, unless the particular address has multiple names, in which case the \"canonical\" name is returned. In this example, the domain name is printed three times, once for each of the three results obtained.\n\n\n"}

Maintained systematically since the 2nd half the 15th century, metrica consisted, initially and primarily, of the copies of the documents issued by the Grand Duke, Lithuanian Council of Lords, and Seimas.\n\nThe Metrica also included some important externally originated documents (like translations of the issues (\"yarlyks\") of the Crimea Khans, copies of the Muscovy diplomatic documents etc.), the office-keeping documental materials (like registers of acts, inventories of the Metrica itself etc.) The selection of the classes of the documents included in the Metrica had increased since the 2nd half 15th – 16th century and even more so in the 17–18th centuries, extending to include the copies of transcripts of diplomatic correspondence, charters of privileges, wills, verdicts, judicial decrees, even certain kinds of private correspondence, e.g., received by the official persons. Sometimes, the external and thematically not quite related collections of the documents had also been referred to as the part of the Metrica, the word \"Metrica\" here to be understood as the State Archive. The documents of the Metrica were to be preserved interminably.\n\nEffectively, the Metrica had become the core of the Archive of the Grand Duke, later the core of the Main State Archive of the GDL, serving the notifying (judicial-registrative), judicial, referential functions. It had been the source of the authoritative official documents (copies of copies). The Metrica developed parallel to and on the model of the Crown Metrica of Poland.\n\nToday, over 600 (estimated) books of the Lithuanian Metrica still exist.\n\nThe word \"metrica\" generates from for archive, from for office book.\n\nThe first historical names of the collection were \"metrics\", \"books of metrica\", \"metrica\". Since the end of the 16th – beginning of the 17th century, the full official name was \"Metrica of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania\". This would be the most appropriate \"scientific name\". The dub \"Lithuanian Metrica\" had been occasionally used in the local office books (by analogy with the Crown Metrica of Poland), since the mid-17th century the dub had consolidated its position in the documents of the Warsaw Archives, later in the Archives of Moscow and St. Petersburg, then in the 19–20th centuries Russian, Polish, Belarusian, Lithuanian historiographies. The name \"Lithuanian Metrica\" is till now traditionally used in the Western publications of the Metrica.\nThe name \"Lithuanian Metrica\" is also used in reference to some contemporary archival collections, including some of the materials of the Chancellery of the GDL (together with other unrelated materials), chiefly in Russia custody.\n\nThe \"prevailing\" language of the documents of the 15th and the most of the 16th century Metrica had been the Ruthenian language. Alternatively, the prevailing use of the Ruthenian language in the Metrica is extended up to the mid-17th century. The documents, concerned with the Western Europe, had been issued in Latin, occasionally in German. The documents, concerned with the Roman Catholic Church, had been issued in Latin. See also naming of the Ruthenian language.\n\nSince the late 16th – early 17th century, the number of the documents composed in Polish and in Latin, had been steadily increasing, until the complete elimination of the Ruthenian from the office use in the GDL, and further official ban on the Ruthenian for the official use (1696). The language of the 17–18th century Metrica is mostly Polish and partly Latin.\n\nState archives were begun in the 13th-century Kingdom of Lithuania. Diplomacy was greatly increased under the rule of Gediminas. During the various wars, floods, and city fires that followed, many official documents were lost. Some were impossible to trace, if these documents had not been duplicated or otherwise copied. A growing need to reproduce these documents later, and the mounting number of edicts, wills, court verdicts etc., determined the evolution of the Lithuanian Metrica. \n\nThe Lithuanian Metrica was stored in the Trakai Island Castle under the supervision of the Treasurer, until 1511. Afterwards the documents were transferred to Vilnius, and kept in what was referred to as the Lower Castle. The responsibility for safeguarding the Metrica there, was supervised by the State Chancellor. By 1569, when the regions of Podlasie, Volhynia, Podolia and the Kiev were separated from Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and incorporated into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, the books which concerned these regions, were removed from the Lithuanian Metrica, and merged into the Crown Metrica. Due to the deterioration of the books, the State Grand Chancellor, Lew Sapieha, ordered the volumes of the Metrica to be recopied in 1594. The recopying process continued until 1607. The newly recopied books were inventoried, rechecked, and transferred to a separate building in Vilnius, with the older books remaining in the Castle of Vilnius. \n\nGreat parts of the Metrica were lost during the wars with Muscovy, and others were taken way by Swedish armies in 1656–1657. Only after the Treaty of Oliva (1660), did the Swedes return many books from the Metrica, but some of them were lost at sea, in the Baltic, during transport back to Lithuania. \n\nThe Metrica from Vilnius was taken to Warsaw in 1765. The books were bound, cataloged and integrated into the system that was in use, in Warsaw. According to an edict issued in 1793, the Lithuanian Metrica was to be transferred from Warsaw to Vilnius again. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), the Lithuanian Metrica was transferred from Warsow to Russia as a war trophy and was kept in Saint Petersburg. Russia gave several of the Lithuanian Metrica books to Prussia in 1799. Afterwards Prussia transferred these books to the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807. The remaining Lithuanian Metrica books in St. Petersburg were inventoried and taken to Moscow. The majority of the historical Lithuanian Metrica's books have been kept in Russia, and today only a small fraction of them are in Lithuania. \n\nThe remaining part of the Lithuanian Metrica is kept in Poland, at the Central Archives of Historical Records in Warsaw.\n\nThe Metrica is one of the most authoritative and revered sources on the history of the GDL. Some of the documents of the Metrica and parts of them had begun to be published in the end 18th century. Larger collections of the materials had begun to be published since 1830s («Digest of Prince Obolyenskiy», altern. «Ambassador’s Book of the Metrica...», in 3 volumes, includes detailed register of the books of the Metrica by Anastasyevich (1817)). Other notable publishers of the Metrica materials had been Lyeontovich, Prohaska, Bershadskiy and others. Other notable publications of the period:\n\nIn 1980s–1990s there had begun a new wave of the publishing of the Metrica materials, this time as an international, Belarusian–Lithuanian–Polish–Russian effort.\n\nThe Metrica had served as a basis for the works of the notable researchers of the GDL history, e.g., Lyubavskiy, Dovnar-Zapol’skiy, Maksimeyka, Lappo, Pichyeta, Malinovskiy, Lawmyanski and others.\n\nThe scientific research of the Metrica itself had begun with the work of Ptaszycki (1887). Other notable researchers of the Metrica: Byeryezhkov, Grimstead, Sułkowska-Kurasiowa.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "626724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=626724", "title": "Lord Darcy (character)", "text": "Lord Darcy (character)\n\nLord Darcy is a detective in an alternate history, created by Randall Garrett. The first stories were asserted to take place in the same year as they were published, but in a world with an alternate history that is different from our own and that is governed by the rules of magic rather than the rules of physics. Despite the magical trappings, the Lord Darcy stories play fair as whodunnits; magic is never used to \"cheat\" a solution, and indeed, the mundane explanation is often obscured by the leap to assume a magical cause.\n\nLord Darcy is the Chief Forensic Investigator or Chief Criminal Investigator for the Duke of Normandy (Prince Richard, the brother of the king), and sometime Special Investigator for the High Court of Chivalry. An Englishman, he lives in Rouen, but spends very little time there. We are told that he speaks Anglo-French with an English accent, and that he speaks several languages and dialects fluently.\n\nHis full name is never given; he is always referred to by his title as the Lord of Arcy (i.e., Lord d'Arcy or Lord Darcy), even by his friends. He dresses in the style of an English aristocrat. He thinks of himself as English and yet Arcy seems to be a French place name. How he comes to be addressed as a \"Lord\" is never explained, though he seems deferential when dealing with other Peers such as Dukes, Counts, and a Marquis. In \"Too Many Magicians\" Darcy is said to be a cousin of the Marquis of London.\n\nThere are two conflicting reports of Lord Darcy's age. In \"The Muddle of the Woad\" he's described as a few years older than the King, who's ten years older than the Duke of Normandy, who was 19 years old in \"The Eyes Have It\", which is set in 1963. This places Lord Darcy's date of birth around 1931. However, he's described in \"The Spell of War\" as an 18-year-old lieutenant in the autumn of the War of '39, which would make him about ten years older.\n\nHis assistant is Master Sean O'Lochlainn, a sorcerer who undertakes magical forensic work. Master Sean is highly proud of Irish magic and its superiority to those of other countries (especially to Polish magic).\n\n\"Too Many Magicians\" is the only Lord Darcy novel written by Randall Garrett: it first appeared in \"Analog\" magazine from August to November 1966 and was issued in book form by Doubleday in 1967. This was followed by two short story collections: \"Murder and Magic\" (1979), and \"Lord Darcy Investigates\" (1981), containing stories that had appeared in \"Analog\", \"Fantastic\" and other magazines. Garrett's extended illness and death prevented him from writing more Lord Darcy tales as he had intended.\n\nTwo more Lord Darcy novels, \"Ten Little Wizards\" (1988), and \"A Study in Sorcery\" (1989), were written by Garrett's friend Michael Kurland after Garrett's death. The two titles were manifestly modeled on those of famous detective novels by, respectively, Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle. This is similar to the way that \"Too Many Magicians\" was modeled on a famous novel by Rex Stout (whose Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have counterparts in the novel's universe in the Marquis de London and his Special Investigator, Lord Bontriomphe). In the eleventh chapter of \"Ten Little Wizards\", Kurland sets Lord Darcy's rank in the peerage as a Baron.\n\n\n\n\nAlso: Michael Kurland's 1969 novel \"The Unicorn Girl\" features protagonists who jump into a series of alternate timelines — and one of the timelines they land in is Lord Darcy's. However, while several minor characters from the Lord Darcy series appear in \"The Unicorn Girl\", neither Lord Darcy nor Master Sean are featured.\n\n\nIn 1999, Randall Garrett won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History Special Achievement Award for the Lord Darcy series.\n\nMagic is a scientific discipline, codified in the fourteenth century by Saint Hilary Robert, much involved with higher mathematics and possessed of theoretical and experimental underpinnings as sophisticated as those of our physics and chemistry. Licensed Sorcerers, possessed of the Talent and properly trained, achieve a wide range of effects. Healing by the laying on of hands is effective and a commonplace treatment for disease and injury; thanks to the efficacy of the Healers, it is common for people to live to the age of 100 and not rare for people to live to 125.\n\nBlack magic is not a categorically different type of magic, but a matter of symbolism and intent—at least in the Anglo-French sphere, as the Kingdom of Italy requests extradition of a woman for black magic when her actual offense was no more than unlicensed magic. However, the effect of symbolism and intent can be substantial; one character, a Witch-Smeller, is capable of detecting its effects on the black magician and his victims.\n\nAlthough magic is a central part of all the stories, none of the murders Lord Darcy investigates are directly caused by magic. All the homicides are committed by mundane means.\n\nFrance and the British Isles are combined into a single state as the Anglo-French Empire, whilst Russia, Italy, and Germany continue as loose collections of small states. Society is stratified—most important government positions are held by nobles, who dispense justice and still maintain private soldiers. The Church is powerful and a central component of everyone's life (there had never been a Reformation, or it took a very different form, as some of the worst abuses of the late-Medieval/Renaissance Catholic Church seem to have been eliminated or minimized). However, serfdom is as dead as in our own world, and the rights of the common people appear to be as well protected as in our world's Western democracies, if in different ways.\n\nAnglo-French regard themselves as fortunate in comparison to the subjects of the Polish King, who are reported to be living under a terrible tyranny. The characters expressing this are all living in the Anglo-French countries, but include a Polish refugee, whom the Italian government accused of black magic, and who is compelled to spy for Poland by a threat to her uncle.\n\nLittle is mentioned of education, although Oxford continues. Lord Darcy is mentioned as being a graduate of the fictional Magog College (1954). A fictional St. Thomas' Academy is also mentioned.\n\nTechnology and physical sciences have suffered somewhat with the emphasis on magic. Physics has not been codified as a science; the one example of an investigator into the discipline is an eccentric on a par with the members of our own Flat Earth Society. Most mechanical devices are approximately those of our Victorian era. Characters travel by horse-drawn carriage and steam train and employ revolving pistols and bolt action rifles; buildings are illuminated with gas lights. An electric torch, with magical parts, is \"a fantastic device, a secret of His Majesty's Government.\" Messages can be sent by an electrical device called the \"teleson\", but the principles by which it operates are not well understood, and the technology to lay teleson lines underwater, or over water, has not yet been developed, so it is impossible to communicate across the Channel. Food is sometimes preserved in iceboxes; a magical \"food preservator\" has been invented, although preservators are expensive and rare because the stasis spell they employ is expensive to maintain, requiring the services of a specialist Journeyman or Master-grade magician. Sorcery is commonly employed in murder investigations, in much the same fashion as forensic science in our own world. Medical technology is not as advanced as in our world, because Healers are so effective, indeed the use of drugs with a genuine but non-magical benefit (\"may cover a wound with moldy bread... or give a patient with heart trouble a tea brewed of foxglove\") is regarded as little more than superstition.\n\nThe Anglo-French Empire was established by the Plantagenets, which dynasty has continued to rule (and which continues to use the Palace of Westminster as a royal residence, with Parliament far weaker than in our timeline). Richard I returned to England after being wounded at the siege of Chaluz, but recovered and ruled well, whilst John Lackland never held the throne and died in exile. Richard then went on to a decisive victory in the Anglo-French War which in our history King John lost. He dethroned the Capetian Dynasty and made himself and his successors Kings of France as well as of England, both kingdoms ruled from London, while Paris was left into the 20th century a provincial town, brooding over its lost glory. The Duchy of Normandy remained attached to the English crown and was never separated from it. Richard died in 1219 and was succeeded by his nephew Arthur whose reign was remembered as a Golden Age and sometimes confused in the popular imagination with that of King Arthur. Seven-hundred-fifty years later the present king is \"John IV, by the Grace of God, King and Emperor of England, France, Scotland, Ireland [all the Anglo-French Empire], New England [North America], and New France [South America]; Defender of the Faith, et cetera\".\n\nTo judge by the Irishman who has a central role in the stories, the Irish in this timeline do not feel particularly oppressed under the Anglo-French throne and have no inclination to become independent. Irish history here seems to have been spared traumatic periods of foreign colonisation and dispossession—and since everybody is Catholic, this Ireland has no problems of rival religious-ethnic communities. Moreover, the Irish are considered especially skilled in Magic - a source of upwards social mobility and prestige. \n\nThe king is also Holy Roman Emperor, exercising loose sovereignty over the many small German and Italian states. However, his actual exercise of sovereignty is limited by the ability of German states to call upon the Poles for help; the chronologically first Lord Darcy story (though not the first written) takes place during a military confrontation between Anglo-French and Polish forces on the soil of Bavaria.\n\nIn Italy the King-Emperor is more of a Constitutional monarch, with an Italian Parliament seemingly holding much more power than the one in London (in a story set in Italy, a local policeman emphasizes that his oath of office is to the Parliament rather than the King). There is no mention, however, of whether the parliament is appointed or elected, and by whom. Italy being united implies that the Catholic Church was, like in our history, deprived at some time of its Temporal power over the city of Rome and its environs, but there is no mention and when and how this happened. \n\nPoland is a major power and the chief rival of the Anglo-French, and the two exist in a situation of Cold War; some of the stories are spy thrillers, where Lord Darcy is pitted against Polish agents and takes on some of the attributes of James Bond (with some magic ingredients added, such as a spell used to make him fall madly in love with a beautiful female Polish agent).\n\nHungary is part of the Polish Empire (the University of Buda-Pest is mentioned as one of Poland's major institutes of learning), and the empire seems to extend southwards into the Balkans. It is stated that Kiev is part of the Polish Empire, and most of the Ukrainian steppe. The Russias are no more than a set of fractious statelets, which might unify in the face of Polish aggression but as yet have failed to do so (it had been close to that situation in some periods of our own history—see Polish-Muscovite War (1605–1618)).\n\nThe main strategy of the Anglo-French is to bottle up the Poles and deny them access to the world's oceans. There is mention of a war in the 1940s (roughly equivalent to World War II, but of a much more limited extent) in which the Polish Navy was decisively beaten. Since then, an alliance with the Scandinavians at the exit from the Baltic and with the Roumelians (Byzantines) at the exit from the Black Sea denies passage to Polish warships—though they try to circumvent this blockade and build an ocean-going navy with the help of some African states.\n\nAs noted, the Byzantine Empire continues to exist and is, at least at times, an Anglo-French ally, but is a minor power corresponding to our Greece, its main importance being the control of the strategic Dardanelles. The Osmanlis rule a realm beyond it, apparently never having spread beyond Anatolia. The Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon never united into a single Spanish realm and were never of much account, and Southern Spain is still predominantly Muslim (one story features a suave Muslim from Granada residing in London).\n\nSince the Point of Departure which set this alternate history off is the survival of Richard the Lion Heart until 1219 and his success in eliminating the Capetians and making himself King of France, presumably in this history The Fourth Crusade of 1204 which fatally crippled the Byzantine Empire never took place. And with John Lackland never taking the throne, he never had a chance to behave tyrannically as a king, and therefore there was no rebellion culminating in the Magna Carta—which may (very partially) explain the lack of any democratic institutions in this 20th century. (By which Garrett may have meant to imply that the villains of history sometimes have their uses.)\n\nMexico (Mechicoe in Anglo-French) is still ruled by Aztecs, headed by the Christianised descendants of Montezuma, having been taken into the empire's high nobility and possessing considerable autonomy. North America (the whole of which is called \"New England\") is in the process of being settled by Europeans, but the process is far less advanced than in our history, with Native American tribes in the 1960s still able to offer significant resistance to whites encroaching on their land. However, there is also mention of thriving tobacco plantations, which seems to indicate that the equivalent of the US South is more thickly settled than the North. Mention is made of the first European ships reaching the shores of new England in 1569.\n\nLittle is mentioned of \"New France\" (South America) beyond a single mention of its jungles being a punitive posting to unruly soldiers, from which it is clear that native inhabitants are far from completely subdued there, either.\n\nThere are only few references to Africa. Lord Darcy's father, who was an army \"coronel\" (i.e. colonel), is mentioned as having fought in a war at Sudan (which might be not exactly the same as our timeline's state of this name). In West Africa, black states are mentioned as maintaining their independence, keeping a balance between the Anglo-French and the Poles, and possessing enough technology to equip modern warships. The impression given is that Africa was not as heavily touched by colonialism as in our timeline. (Presumably, because the Anglo-French have a whole continent at their disposal on the other side of the Atlantic, and they do their best to bar Polish access.)\n\nAs in many of Garrett's other writings, he takes every opportunity to insert subtle, or otherwise, allusions to other fiction — in these stories there are many echoes of other classic, or otherwise, detectives. For example, in \"Too Many Magicians\" there is a cameo appearance by the Marquis de London, who looks and talks like Nero Wolfe, an identification reinforced by his sidekick Lord Bontriomphe (whose name is a literal French translation of \"Goodwin\") and his cook Frederique Bruleur (corresponding to Wolfe's cook Fritz Brenner). The title, furthermore, echoes Wolfe novels \"Too Many Cooks\" (1938), \"Too Many Women\" (1947) and \"Too Many Clients\" (1960). That novel also contains a number of punning references to \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\". More subtly, the murder victim, a famous Master Sorcerer named Sir James Zwinge, is named for Randall James Zwinge, better known as the stage magician James Randi; and the head of the magician's guild is Sir Lyon Gandolphus Gray, whose name is partially a reference to Gandalf from J. R. R. Tolkien and partially that of fantasy author Lyon Sprague de Camp, and whose appearance as described partakes of both men's appearance. In the short story \"The Bitter End\", a bumbling Sergeant-at-Arms is named Cougair Chasseur, a clear reference to Inspector Clouseau of the Pink Panther movies. And in several stories there is a secret agent, Sir James le Lein (\"le lien\" is French for \"bond\"; a clear James Bond reference).\n\nThe story \"A Case Of Identity\" also contains two subtle references to contract bridge, including a magic spell for establishing identity called the Jacoby transfer which requires blood from \"at least two hearts.\" This is an allusion to a bridge convention known as transfer bidding, which attempts to make the stronger, concealed hand the declarer, and always results in a contract of at least Two Hearts. Also in the story, the murder victim is described as having been struck with a long club, because \"according to the Kaplan–Sheinwold test, a short club cannot have been used.\" In the Kaplan–Sheinwold bidding system, making an opening bid of \"one club\" when holding two or fewer club cards-a \"short club\"-is not permitted.\n\nThe story \"The Sixteen Keys\" contains a reference to the \"von Horst–Shea\" process, whereby a person can maintain a lifelong youthful appearance, at the expense of a much shorter life, and a sudden dissolution at the end of it. This is done by a magical \"balancing\" of the body's processes, so that no one part of the body wears out before any other. This is a clear reference to the name of, and events in, Oliver Wendell Holmes' poem, \"The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay\".\n\nIn two stories, Darcy encounters a magical reference to E. E. \"Doc\" Smith's Lensman series: King's Messengers, couriers who identify themselves with a be-gemmed badge that glows red for its owner, and only its owner. The spell on the badge is said to be invented by magician Sir Edward Elmer in the Thirties, and to have remained secret ever since. \"E.E.\" was short for Edward Elmer, and the badges are a reference to a device which preceded the Lens which gave the Lensmen their name.\n\nDarcy himself resembles Sherlock Holmes in a number of ways. However, unlike Watson, whose primary purpose was to allow Holmes to explain his deductions, Sean O'Lochlainn is more of a counterpart than a foil. The relationship between the two is very similar to that of the suave, analytical Napoleon Solo (Darcy) and technical expert Illya Kuryakin (O'Lochlainn).\n\nSometime Garrett collaborator Michael Kurland (who would himself write later Lord Darcy works, with the permission of Garrett's estate) appears as Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Coeur-Terre in \"Too Many Magicians\"; and in \"A Case of Identity\" the Marquise of Rouen, worried about her missing husband, is described as drinking herself into a stupor on \"the best brandy, the St. Courlande-Michele.\" Similarly several books feature a magical theorist named Sir Thomas Leseaux, a play on another of Garrett's friends, the author and stage magician T. A. Waters.\n\nThe strong relation between Lord Darcy and Master Sean O'Lochlainn in some ways recalls that between Dorothy L. Sayers's Lord Peter Wimsey and his servant Mervyn Bunter. In both cases there is a successful detection team composed of a nobleman and a commoner, with a built-in social hierarchy tempered by a strong and long-lasting personal friendship; in both cases, the commoner partner is an extremely capable and competent person, highly appreciated by his socially-superior noble partner; and in both cases, the partnership started as a wartime relationship between an officer and an NCO, and carried over into civilian life. Garrett's debt to Sayers and Lord Peter Wimsey perhaps strayed over the line in \"A Matter Of Gravity\" in which the method of murder was essentially a direct copy of the method in Sayers' \"Busman's Honeymoon.\"\n\nThe story \"The Napoli Express\", a mystery taking place on board a socially-prestigious train travelling from London to Naples, is clearly related to the considerable subgenre of works whose plots take place on board the Orient Express.\n\nElizabeth Bear, whose novel \"New Amsterdam\" is set in a (quite different) alternate timeline where magic works, acknowledged her debt to the Darcy stories by giving her protagonist, a forensic sorceress, the name Abigail Irene Garrett.\n\nIn David Weber's Honorverse novel \"Mission of Honor\", a character is reading \"a novel about the psychically gifted detective Garrett Randall by the highly popular Darcy Lord.\"\n\nThough having a completely different historical origin, Lord Darcy's 20th century has many similarities with that of John Brunner's \"Times Without Number\". In both there is a Catholic Empire based in London and ruling the British Islands, France and the entire Western Hemisphere (with Christianized Native Americans accepted into its aristocracy). And in both works the Empire depicted is monarchial and conservative, without any trace of democracy, but still relatively benevolent; locked in a decades-long cold war with an Eastern European rival; technologically backward compared to our world, but still possessing a key field of knowledge (magic, time travel) unknown to our 20th century.\n\n"}

{"id": "24708120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24708120", "title": "Old Tibetan Chronicle", "text": "Old Tibetan Chronicle\n\nThe Old Tibetan Chronicle is a collection of narrative accounts and songs relating to Tibet's Yarlung dynasty and the Tibetan Empire. The three manuscripts that comprise the only extant copies of the Chronicle are among the Dunhuang Manuscripts found in the early 20th century in the so-called \"hidden library\" at the Mogao Grottoes near Dunhuang, which is believed to have been sealed in the 11th century CE. The \"Chronicle\", together with the Old Tibetan Annals comprise Tibet's earliest extant history.\n\nAn enormous number of early manuscripts in a variety of languages were collected by Aurel Stein and Paul Pelliot at the famous sealed-up Library Cave (no. 17) of the Mogao Grottoes at Dunhuang and sent back to London and Paris respectively. The \"Dunhuang manuscripts\" in the Tibetan language include the Old Tibetan Chronicle, which was probably compiled in the early 9th century, and the Old Tibetan Annals, which have been described as \"the first and single most important documents available on early Tibetan history.\"\n\nThe \"Old Tibetan Chronicle\" is extant in two manuscripts in the Pelliot Collection at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, and some manuscript fragments. The main scroll comprises Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287. The Tibetan text is written on the blank verso sides of panels pasted together from Chinese scrolls. In the first critical edition of Pelliot tibétain 1286 and Pelliot tibétain 1287, Jacques Bacot and Charles Toussaint considered them to be represent separate texts and referred to Pelliot tibétain 1286 as \"Principautés anciennes et généalogie des rois,\" but following the suggestion of Geza Uray, both are now considered to be two parts a single original manuscript and can be referred to together as the Old Tibetan Chronicle. In addition, two folios from a single original manuscript, Pelliot tibétain 1144 and IOL Tib J 1375, overlap with narratives found in the Chronicle, though differing in certain details.\n\nThe \"Old Tibetan Chronicle\" is a composite text of various lists, narratives and bardic songs arranged to form a single account of the reigns of the Tibetan emperors. As the list of the Tibetan emperors found in the narrative ends with U Dumten ('U'i dum brtan), later known as Langdarma, the \"Chronicle\" must have been compiled during or soon after the reign of this emperor, that is, in the 840s. Geza Uray has argued that this composition was made in Dunhuang itself rather than Central Tibet.\n\nThe Chronicle begins with a series of lists - of marriage alliances, principalities, emperors and ministers. The list of emperors is prefaced by an account of the descent of the first emperor Nyatri Tsenpo (gNya'-khri bTsan-po) from heaven, and ends with an account of the death of Drigum Tsenpo, the first mortal in the line. After this the Chronicle narrates the overthrow of the prince Zingpoje - this narrative is also represented in the fragmentary Version II of the Chronicle. The narrative then continues with an account of the following Tibetan emperors before coming to the reign of Songtsen Gampo (r. c.605–649). This section actually concentrates on the activities of the minister Khyungpo Pungse. The Chronicle then continues with a narrative of the following emperors, before coming to Trisong Detsen (r. 756-c.800), in which his victory over the rival Tibetan king Lig Myi-rhya is celebrated. The Chronicle then returns to the reign of an earlier emperor Tridu Songtsen (676-704), and his victory over a claim to rule Tibetan by the Gar clan.\n\nThe Chronicle does not offer a comprehensive account of the history of Tibet. This is partly because of the nature of its composition from earlier narratives and songs. It has also been argued by Lajos Ligeti and Geza Uray that the material in the Chronicle represents the interests of specific Tibetan clans, namely the Dba' and Myang clans (Ligeti adds the Mnon and Tshe-spong clans as well). In this it is comparable to another early Tibetan historical text, the Testament of Ba, which represents the interests of the Dba' clan. Contradicting later Tibetan Buddhist histories, neither the \"Annals\" nor the \"Chronicle\" make any mention of Buddhism in the reign of Songtsen Gampo. However, the \"Chronicle\" does say that, during the reign of king Trisong Detsen (Khri srong lde brtsan- ruled from 755 to 797 or 804 CE), \"The incomparable religion of the Buddha had been received and there were viharas (monasteries) in the centre as well as the borderlands of the country.\"\n\nIt has been clear since the Chronicle was first published that there are problems with its chronology. The victory over Lig Myi-rhya is narrated in the section on Trisong Detsen, yet in the victory song and the following narrative the emperor named is Songtsen Gampo, who ruled over a century earlier. Furthermore, the Chronicle ends in the reign of Tridu Songtsen (676-704), which should come between Songtsen Gampo and Trisong Detsen. There are two main theories regarding this anachronism. Ariane Macdonald and Yoshiro Imaeda have argued that the problems with chronology arose because the Chronicle was composed from a variety of different sources. Geza Uray on the other hand has argued that the scroll of Pelliot tibétain 1287 was cut up and rearranged some time after it was originally written, and the chronological problem results from this. He suggests that this later cutting and pasting may have been done specifically in order to associate the conquest of Lig Myi-rhya with the emperor Trisong Detsen, pointing out that the Bonpo historical tradition also makes that association.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1108858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1108858", "title": "Reporting mark", "text": "Reporting mark\n\nA reporting mark is an alphabetic code of one to four letters used to identify owners or lessees of rolling stock and other equipment used on certain railroad networks.\n\nIn North America the mark, which consists of an alphabetic code of one to four letters, is stenciled on each piece of equipment, along with a one- to six-digit number. This information is used to uniquely identify every such rail car or locomotive, thus allowing it to be tracked by the railroad they are traveling over, which shares the information with other railroads and customers.\n\nThe Association of American Railroads (AAR) assigns marks to all carriers, under authority granted by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, Transport Canada, and Mexican Government.\n\nUnder current practice, the first letter must match the initial letter of the railroad name. As it also acts as a Standard Carrier Alpha Code, the reporting mark cannot conflict with codes in use by other nonrail carriers.\n\nMarks ending with the letter \"X\" are assigned to companies or individuals who own railcars, but are not operating railroads; for example, the TTX Company (formerly Trailer Train Company) is named for its original reporting mark of TTX. In another example, the reporting mark for state-funded Amtrak services in California is CDTX (whereas the usual Amtrak mark is AMTK) because the state transportation agency (Caltrans) owns the equipment used in these services. This may also apply to commuter rail, for example Metrolink in Southern California uses the reporting mark SCAX because the equipment is owned by the Southern California Regional Rail Authority—which owns the Metrolink system—even though it is operated by Amtrak. This is why the reporting mark for CSX Transportation, which is an operating railroad, is CSXT instead of CSX. Private (non-common carrier) freight car owners in Mexico were issued, up until around 1990, reporting marks ending in two X's, possibly to signify that their cars followed different regulations (such as bans on friction bearing trucks) than their American counterparts and so their viability for interchange service was impaired. This often resulted in five-letter reporting marks, an option not otherwise allowed by the AAR.\nCompanies owning trailers used in trailer-on-flatcar service are assigned marks ending with the letter \"Z\", and the National Motor Freight Traffic Association, which maintains the list of Standard Carrier Alpha Codes, assigns marks ending in U to owners of intermodal containers. The standard ISO 6346 covers identifiers for intermodal containers.\n\nWhen the owner of a reporting mark is taken over by another company, the old mark becomes the property of the new company. For example, when the Union Pacific Railroad (mark UP) acquired the Chicago and North Western Railway (mark CNW) in the 1990s, it retained the CNW mark rather than immediately repaint all acquired equipment. Some companies own several marks that are used to identify different classes of cars, such as boxcars or gondolas. If the acquiring company discontinues the name or mark of the acquired company, the discontinued mark is referred to as a \"fallen flag\" railway. Occasionally, long-disused marks are suddenly revived by the companies which now own them. For example, in recent years, the Union Pacific Railroad has begun to use the mark CMO on newly built covered hoppers, gondolas and five-bay coal hoppers. CMO originally belonged to a predecessor of the CNW, which passed it on to them, from which the UP inherited it. Similarly, during the breakup of Conrail, the long-retired marks of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and New York Central Railroad (NYC) were temporarily brought back and applied to much of Conrail's fleet to signify which cars and locomotives were to go to CSX (all cars labeled NYC) and which to Norfolk Southern (all cars labeled PRR). Some of these cars still retain their temporary NYC marks.\n\nBecause of its size, this list has been split into subpages based on the first letter of the reporting mark. Railinc, a subsidiary of the AAR, maintains the active reporting marks for the North American rail industry. Railinc offers a free online look-up of reporting marks and other industry reference files through the Railinc's Freight Rail 411 website. \nA railway vehicle must be registered in a national vehicle register (NVR) using a 12-digit number derived from the old UIC system of vehicle numbering. The number contains the register country in the third and fourth digit. The keeper of a vehicle is indicated with a company abbreviation of maximum five letters, called Vehicle Keeper Marking (VKM) which must be registered with OTIF and ERA and is unique throughout Europe and parts of Asia and Northern Africa. The VKM must not contain special signs or digits.\n\nThe VKM is preceded by the code for the country (according to the alphabetical coding system described in Appendix 4 to the 1949 convention and Article 45(4) of the 1968 convention on road traffic), where the vehicle is registered and a hyphen. Some examples:\n\nWhen a vehicle is sold it will not normally be transferred to another register. The Czech railways bought large numbers of coaches from ÖBB. The number remained the same but the VKM changed from A-ÖBB to A-ČD.\n\nThe UIC introduced a uniform numbering system for their members based on a 12-digit number, largely known as \"UIC number\". The third and fourth digit of the number indicated the owner, or more precisely the keeper of the vehicle. Thus each UIC member got a two-digit owner code. With the introduction of national vehicle registers this code became a country code. Some vehicles had to be renumbered as a consequence. The Swiss company BLS Lötschbergbahn had the owner code 63. When their vehicles were registered, they got numbers with the country code 85 for Switzerland and the VKM BLS. Example for an \"Einheitswagen\" delivered in 1957:\n\nIn the United Kingdom, prior to nationalisation, wagons owned by the major railways were marked with codes of two to four letters, these codes normally being the initials of the railway concerned; for example, wagons of the Great Western Railway were marked \"G W\"; those of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway were marked \"L M S\", etc. The codes were agreed between the railways and registered with the Railway Clearing House.\n\n\n"}

Also, the marriage had to be celebrated by a clergyman of one of the religious denominations then in Ireland.\n\nSome clergymen were willing, for a fee, to marry couples in secret, in \"irregular\" or \"clandestine\" marriages. This might have been necessary for a number of reasons, for example, objections of parents, problems with religious affiliation, or financial difficulty.

{"id": "4362362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4362362", "title": "Siku Quanshu", "text": "Siku Quanshu\n\nThe Siku Quanshu, variously translated as the \"Complete Library in Four Sections\", \"Imperial Collection of Four\", \"Emperor's Four Treasuries\", \"Complete Library in Four Branches of Literature\", or \"Complete Library of the Four Treasuries\", is the largest collection of books in Chinese history. The complete encyclopedia contains an annotated catalogue of 10,680 titles along with a compendiums of 3,593 titles. The \"Siku Quanshu\" ended up surpassing the Ming dynasty's 1403 \"Yongle Encyclopedia\" in size, which was China's largest encyclopedia prior to the creation of the Siku Quanshu.\n\nLate in the 18th Century, Qing dynasty set about a momentous task, the creation of the \"Siku Quanshu\". The Qianlong Emperor ordered the creation of the \"Siku Quanshu\" in 1772. Local and Provincial officers were in charge of locating and collecting important books. The Qianlong Emperor encouraged owners of rare or valuable books to send them to the capital, however few actually did due to concerns about the Literary Inquisition. Towards the end of 1772, seeing that only a limited number of people actually handed in books, the Qianlong Emperor issued imperial decrees stressing that books would be returned to their owners once the compilation was finished and that owners of the books would not be persecuted if their books contained anti-Manchu sentiment. Less than three months after the issue of this decree, four to five thousand books were handed in.\n\nBy March 1773, an editorial board (composed of hundreds of editors, collators, and copyists) was created in Beijing to gather and review books brought to them. This board included over 361 scholars, with Ji Yun and Lu Xixiong (陸錫熊) as chief editors. There was around 3,826 scribes who copied every word by hand. These copyists were not paid in coinage but in government positions after they had transcribed a set amount of the encyclopedia. It took over a decade until the encyclopedia was completed and all seven copies were distributed.\n\nThe Qianlong Emperor commissioned seven copies of the \"Siku Quanshu\" to be made. The first four copies were for the Emperor and were kept in the north. The Qianlong Emperor constructed special libraries for them. They were located in the Forbidden City, Old Summer Palace, Shenyang, and Chengde. The remaining three copies were sent to the south. They were deposited into libraries within the cities of Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou. All seven libraries also received copies of the 1725 imperial encyclopedia \"Gujin tushu jicheng\".\n\nThe copy kept in the Old Summer Palace was destroyed during the Second Opium War in 1860. During the fight against the English and the French, the Old Summer Palace copy was burned. The two copies kept in Zhenjang and Yangzhou were completely destroyed while the copy kept in Hangzhou was only about 70 to 80 percent destroyed, during the Taiping Rebellion. The four remaining copies suffered some damage during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Today, those copies can be located in the National Library of China in Beijing, the National Palace Museum in Taipei, the Gansu Library in Lanzhou, and the Zhejiang Library in Hangzhou.\n\nThe Qianlong Emperor did not make good on his promises to return the books. Any books that did not make it into the \"Siku Quanshu\" risked becoming part of the \"Siku Jinshu (Chinese: 四库禁书).\" The \"Siku Jinshu\" is a catalogue of over 2,855 books that were rejected and banned during the completion of the \"Siku Quanshu\". An additional four to five hundred other books were edited and censored. A majority of the books that were banned were written towards the end of the Ming Dynasty and contained anti-Manchu sentiment. The \"Siku Jinshu\" was the Qianlong Emperor's attempt to rid the Qing Dynasty of any Ming Loyalists by executing scholars and burned any books that gave direct or implied political attacks against the Manchu.\n\nEach copy of the \"Siku Quanshu\" was bound into 36,381 volumes (册), with more than 79,000 chapters (卷). In total, each copy is around 2.3 million pages, and has approximately 800 million Chinese characters.\n\nThe scholars working on the \"Siku Quanshu\" wrote a descriptive note for each book which detailed the author's name along with their place and year of birth. Next, after they determined what parts of the author's work would go into the compilation, they would analyzed the main points of the author's argument. This short annotation, which reflected their own opinion, would be put in the beginning of the \"Siku Quanshu\" and formed the Complete Catalogue. The Complete Catalogue was divided into four sections or \"kù\" (; translated to \"warehouse; storehouse; treasury; repository\"), in reference to the imperial library divisions. The name, Siku Quanshu, is a reference to these four sections. These four sections are:\n\nThe books are then divided into 44 sub-categories, or \"lèi\" (). The \"Siku Quanshu\" collection includes most major Chinese texts, from the ancient Zhou Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, covering all domains of academia. It also lacks any Western or Japanese texts. Included within these 44 sub-categories are: the \"Analects of Confucius\", \"Mencius\", \"Great Learning\", \"Doctrine of the Mean\", \"I Ching\", \"Rites of Zhou\", \"Classic of Rites\", \"Classic of Poetry\", \"Spring and Autumn Annals\", \"Shuowen Jiezi\", \"Records of the Grand Historian\", \"Zizhi Tongjian\", \"The Art of War\", \"Guoyu\", \"Stratagems of the Warring States\", \"Compendium of Materia Medica\", and other classics.\n\nTwo of Zhao Yiguang's works are housed in the Wang Qishu, they were the \"Jiuhuan Shitu\" (九圜史圖) and the \"Liuhe Mantu\" (六匌曼圖). They were part of the Siku Quanshu Cunmu Congshu (四庫全書存目叢書).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13969948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13969948", "title": "The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics", "text": "The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics\n\nThe New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics (2018), 3rd ed., is an twenty-volume reference work on economics published by Palgrave Macmillan. It contains around 3,000 entries, including many classic essays from the original Inglis Palgrave Dictionary, and a significant increase in new entries from the previous editions by the most prominent economists in the field, among them 36 winners of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Articles are classified according to \"Journal of Economic Literature\" (\"JEL\") classification codes.\n\n\"The New Palgrave\" is also available in a hyperlinked online version. Online content is added to the 2018 edition, and a 4th edition under the editorship of J. Barkley Rosser Jr., Esteban Pérez Caldentey, and Matías Vernengo will be published in the future. The first edition was titled \"The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics\" (1987), was idealized and edited by John Eatwell, Murray Milgate, and Peter Newman, as a way of recovering the legacy of Inglis Palgrave famous dictionary. It was published in four volumes, while the second edition was under the direction of Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume and was published in eight volumes. Both are discussed in a section below.\n\nAccess to full-text articles for all editions and post-2018 updates is available online by subscription, whether of an organization, a person, or a person through an organization.\n\nThe New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics (1987) is the title of the first \"New Palgrave\" edition. It is a four-volume reference edited by John Eatwell, Murray Milgate, and Peter Newman. It has 4,000 pages of entries, including 1,300 subject entries (with 4,000 cross-references), and 655 biographies. There were 927 contributors, including 13 Nobel Laureates in Economics at the time of first publication. It includes about 50 articles from \"Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy\" (1925–1927). It was roughly twice the length of its predecessor and differed further in excluding most subjects not on economics or closely related to its practice. It was developed as a modern version of the old Inglis Palgrave dictionary, with entries written by prominent economists for a highly specialized public.\n\nReviewing the 1987 edition for the \"New York Times\", Robert M. Solow concluded that \"this is a dictionary only in a very special sense. There are excellent survey articles, in various sizes, on various subjects. But the best of them are written by professionals for professionals.\" According to Solow, graduate students in economics would find the dictionary useful, but most of the articles would be inaccessible to non-economists, even undergraduate students of the liberal arts. For economists, however, the dictionary provided many excellent overviews of contemporary research. In response, editor confirmed that the articles were written for an audience of professional economists, and so neither for the general reading public nor for specialist economists.\n\nAccording to Milgate, \"New Palgrave\" downplayed mathematics, in comparison to leading economic journals. Only 24% of the columns \"contained\" \"any mathematics\" (and so required expensive hand-typesetting), while only 25% of the most recent issue of the \"American Economic Review\" (\"AER\") in fact \"lacked\" mathematics, according to Milgate, who averred that the \"AER\" mathematical usage was typical of leading contemporary journals: The \"New Palgrave\"s usage of mathematics was the reciprocal of the contemporary profession's. \"It must be concluded that the \"New Palgrave\" actually under-represented the mathematical element in modern economics; and under-represented it to a significant degree\", wrote .\n\nCommenting on contemporary economics, Solow described technical economics as its essential \"infrastructure\": \n\nMore advanced mathematics was implicit in some of the articles, many of which were well written and reasonably accessible. Solow recommended the \"broad and deep\" article on game theory by Robert J. Aumann for well-equipped graduate students, along with John Harsanyi's article on bargaining theory. The articles on financial economics were \"written by the best people—Stephen Ross, Robert Merton, and others—and they show it\"; however, they were too difficult for the average investor. Complimenting the article on international trade, Solow added a \"caveat lector\": \"But God forbid that\" a reader without knowledge of economics should try to understand protectionism, by consulting the \"New Palgrave\".\n\nIn his review, George Stigler commended the dictionary's non-technical and conceptually rich article on social choice, which was written by Kenneth Arrow, among \"numerous\" excellent articles. However, Stigler criticized the inclusion of \"dozens\" of articles in mathematical economics, which failed to provide intuitive introductions to the problem, how it was solved, and what the solution is: \"These articles were written, not for a tolerably competent economist, but exclusively for fellow specialists.\"\n\nWhitaker wrote, \"Readers to whom economics is nothing if not a science based on empirical inquiry may be dismayed by the lack of attention to empirical studies and factual matters\".\n\nStigler criticized the \"New Palgrave\" for largely ignoring empirical economics—economic data, summary statistics, and econometric investigations. According to Stigler, the empirical investigation of consumption and production functions has profoundly influenced microeconomic theory, while the empirical investigation of price levels has profoundly influenced monetary economics: The \"New Palgrave\"'s neglect of empirical economics also weakened its treatment of economic theory and the history of economic thought. Furthermore, the editors failed to explain their neglect of empirical economics, while they gave large space to treatments of \"technical economics\", especially mathematical economics, and faddish topics, wrote Stigler.\n\n\"The article on 'Profit and profit theory' does not contain a single number for what profits are or ever have been, in the United States or any other country, or any reference to any source that might provide such a number\", wrote Herbert Stein, who complained \"There are articles about elasticities of this or that but no estimate of the elasticity of anything.\"\n\nReviewing the critics of the over-emphasis on theoretical and \"doctrinal\" economics, editor Milgate admitted that the \"New Palgrave\" was flawed by its neglect of empirical economics.\n\nRobert M. Solow criticized the 1987 edition for slighting mainstream economics by giving excessive space to the \"dissenting fringes within academic economics\", namely Marxist economics as well as \"Austrian persuasion\", Post-Keynesians, and neo-Ricardian.\n\nThe 1987 dictionary's discussion of heterodox approaches was also criticized by George Stigler, who complained that these articles were written by sympathetic editors in a partisan manner: \n\nThe selection of sympathetic writers ... is in fact a general practice in \"Palgrave II\". Israel Kirzner's essay on the Austrian economists does not hint at the existence of error, misrepresentation of critics, or tasteless attacks upon the German Historical School, and Klaus Henning did little better with Böhm-Bawerk. An ersatz Austrian\nis apparently more loyal than the genuine article.\n[Italics added]\nStigler complained about the extensive and biased articles on Marxist economics, including \"neo-Ricardian\" economists (who follow Piero Sraffa): \"A nonprofessional reader would never guess from these volumes that economists working in the Marxian-Sraffian tradition represent a small minority of modern economists, and that their writings have virtually no impact upon the professional work of most economists in major English-language universities.\" Stigler provided a table of articles that were biased by Marxist orthodoxy and criticized some authors by name, especially a \"violently pro-Marxist\" entry by C. B. Macpherson.\n\nThe General Editors were Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume. It added considerably on the previous edition, and maintained the general conception of the dictionary as written for advanced specialists. The list of Nobel laureates increased to 25, and the number of volumes also doubled. Perhaps as a result of already being an established institution there were a considerably smaller number of reviews. Declan Trott argued that the Dictionary is not properly a dictionary or an encyclopedia and that the quality and depth of the entries are very uneven, comparing it with Wikipedia as a source for information on economics.\n\nR. H. Inglis Palgrave's \"Dictionary of Political Economy\" (1894–1899), 3 v., was the forerunner of \"The New Palgrave\". The initial contractual agreement between Palgrave and the publisher Macmillan & Co. is dated 1888. Serial installments in 1891–92 had disappointing sales. An appendix was added to Volume III in 1908, so completing publication of the set. The \"Dictionary\" was wide-ranging and sometimes idiosyncratic. It included for example a comprehensive treatment of laws on property and commercial transactions. Professional reaction has been described as generally favorable and unsurprising, \"given that almost all economists of any repute had already endorsed the enterprise by agreeing to contribute.\" Nearly thirty years after the first volume appeared, \"Palgrave's Dictionary of Political Economy\" (1923–1926), edited by Henry Higgs, appeared with Palgrave's name added to the title but few changes in structure or contents.\n\n\n"}

The book was published by Knopf, the firm that published almost all of Child's work from the beginning to the end of her career. The video series was produced with and marketed by the WGBH Educational Foundation in Boston but was shot at Child's home in Santa Barbara, California.\n\n\"The Way To Cook\" differs from \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" in numerous ways. While \"Mastering\" was a collaboration that co-authors Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle had gotten underway before Child's involvement, \"The Way To Cook\" was a solo work written entirely by Child during the late 1980s. Another difference was that \"The Way To Cook\" did not focus entirely on French cuisine, on which her reputation had been built, but added a substantial number of recipes for traditional American dishes, especially those of New England, where Child's mother had come from and where Child had spent much of her life. In this, the book reflected the diversification of the cooking repertoire on Child's television show, \"Julia Child & Company,\" that had taken place since its premiere in 1978.\n\nThe book also formally described an approach to teaching that Child and others had been using since the very beginning, providing a more explicit focus on \"master recipes\"—that is, recipes that illustrate broad principles in cooking—with other recipes provided as variations on those same themes. The book also made greater use of improved cookware designs and of new technology such as the food processor, of which Child was a major proponent. The 1983 revision of \"Mastering\" was inspired in large part by the introduction of the food processor into the market.\n\nThe book immediately proved to be extremely popular, with four printings in the first month after its introduction; it remains in print nearly two decades later, in both hardcover and softcover editions. In December 2009, the videos, originally available only as a set of six videotapes, were re-released as a set of two DVDs.\n"}

In 1907, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney established the \"Whitney Studio Gallery\" at 8 West 8th Street adjacent to her own MacDougal Alley studio. This, and the later \"Whitney Studio Club\" at 147 West 4th Street, were intended to provide young artists with places to meet and exhibit their works.\n\nIn 1918, American artist and friend Robert Winthrop Chanler was commissioned to redesign the interior of the 8th street property, adding an allegorical bas-relief ceiling, a 20-foot-high plaster and bronze fireplace, elaborate stained glass windows and decorative screens.\n\nIn 1929, when the Metropolitan Museum of Art rejected Whitney's offer of the gift of nearly 500 new artworks that she had collected, Whitney established the Whitney Museum of American Art.

{"id": "5165163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5165163", "title": "Yugoslav National Movement", "text": "Yugoslav National Movement\n\nThe Yugoslav National Movement (), also known as the United Militant Labour Organization (\"Združena borbena organizacija rada\" / \"Здружена борбена организација рада\", or Zbor / \"Збор\"), was a Yugoslav authoritarian movement led by politician Dimitrije Ljotić. Founded in 1935, it received considerable German financial and political assistance during the interwar period and participated in the 1935 and 1938 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, in which it never received more than 1 percent of the popular vote.\n\nFollowing the Axis invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Germans selected several Zbor members to join the Serbian puppet government of Milan Nedić. The Serbian Volunteer Corps (SDK) was established as Zbor's party army. Ljotić had no control over the SDK, which was commanded by Colonel Kosta Mušicki. In late 1944, Ljotić and his followers retreated to Slovenia with the Germans and other collaborationist formations. In March, Ljotić and Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović agreed on a last-ditch alliance against the Yugoslav Partisans. Ljotić's followers were placed under the command of Chetnik commander Miodrag Damjanović. Ljotić was killed in an automobile accident in late April 1945. His followers later fled to Italy alongside the Chetniks. The Western Allies extradited many back to Yugoslavia following the war, where they were summarily executed and buried in mass graves. Those who were not extradited immigrated to western countries and established émigré organizations intended to promote Zbor's political agenda.\n\nDimitrije Ljotić was a right-wing politician in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia during the interwar period. On 16 February 1931, he was appointed to the position of Yugoslav Minister of Justice by King Alexander as a result of his unwavering loyalty to the Karađorđević dynasty. In June of that year, Ljotić suggested to Alexander that the Yugoslav political system be structured on the Italian fascist model. He presented him with a draft constitution that proposed \"an organic constitutional hereditary monarchy, undemocratic and non-parliamentary, based on the mobilization of popular forces, gathered around economic, professional, cultural and charity organizations, that would be politically accountable to the king.\" The king rejected Ljotić's constitution as being too authoritarian. On 17 August, Ljotić resigned from his post after the government decided to create a single government-backed political party in Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 1934, Alexander was assassinated in Marseille. That year, Ljotić made contact with three pro-fascist movements and the publishers of their respective newspapers—\"Otadžbina\" (Fatherland), published in Belgrade; the monthly \"Zbor\" (Rally), published in Herzegovina; and the weekly \"Buđenje\" (Awakening), published in Petrovgrad (modern Zrenjanin). Ljotić contributed to all three publications and became most influential with the \"Otadžbina\" movement. He subsequently founded the Yugoslav National Movement (), which was also known as the United Active Labour Organization (\"Združena borbena organizacija rada\", or Zbor). Zbor was created by the merger of three fascist movements—Yugoslav Action, the \"Fighters\" from Ljubljana, and \"Buđenje\" from Petrovgrad. It was officially established in Belgrade on 6 January 1935, the sixth anniversary of King Alexander's dictatorship proclamation. Its members elected Ljotić its president, Juraj Korenić its vice-president, Fran Kandare as second vice-president and Velibor Jonić as its secretary-general. Ljotić was chosen because of his previous stint as Minister of Justice and because of his connections with the royal court.\n\nZbor's official stated goal was the imposition of a planned economy and \"the racial and biological defense of the national life-force and the family\". \"Otadžbina\" became its official newspaper. The party was declared illegal upon establishment, since virtually all political parties in Yugoslavia had been banned since the declaration of King Alexander's dictatorship in 1929. On 2 September 1935, Jonić and attorney Milan Aćimović petitioned the Yugoslav Ministry of the Interior to legalize Zbor. On 8 November, the Ministry of the Interior conceded and recognized Zbor as an official political party. German officials in Yugoslavia quickly took notice of the movement, with the German envoy to Yugoslavia, Viktor von Heeren, providing it with financial assistance and infiltrating it with German agents. A German observer noted: \"The movement Zbor represents a kind of national socialist party. Its principles are the struggle against Freemasons, against Jews, against Communists and against western capitalism.\" German industrial firms provided Zbor with further financial aid, as did German intelligence services. Most of the support that Zbor received in Serbia came from members of the urban middle class, as well as right-wing students and members of the armed forces. The majority of Zbor's members were ethnic Serbs, with some Croats and Slovenes joining the party in small numbers. Its membership fluctuated often, primarily due to disagreements over Ljotić's authoritarianism and lack of popularity and political power in Serbia. Ljotić was an unpopular figure in Serbia due to his pro-German sympathies and religious fanaticism. The limited amount of support received by Zbor itself stemmed from the fact that radical right-wing sentiment was not strong amongst the Serbian population. The reason for this was that far right-wing politics were associated with Germany. Being extremely anti-German, the majority of ethnic Serbs rejected fascist and Nazi ideas outright. Zbor never had more than 10,000 active members at any given time, with most of its support coming from Smederevo and from the ethnic German (\"Volksdeutsche\") minority in Vojvodina that had been exposed to Nazi propaganda since 1933.\n\nDuring Milan Stojadinović's premiership, many members of Zbor left the party and joined Stojadinović's Yugoslav Radical Union (, JRZ). Nevertheless, the movement continued to advocate the abandonment of individualism and parliamentary democracy. Ljotić called for Yugoslavia to unite around a single ruler and return to its religious and cultural traditions, embracing the teachings of Christianity, traditional values and corporatism. He advocated a centrally organized state, stating that the unification of South Slavs was a historical and political inevitability and that Serbs, Croats and Slovenes shared \"blood kinship and feeling of common fate.\" At the same time, the Yugoslavia that Ljotić envisioned was one that was to be dominated by Serbia. Zbor openly promoted antisemitism, being the only party in Yugoslavia to openly do so, as well as xenophobia.\n\nDespite its opposition to parliamentary democracy, Zbor participated in the 1935 Yugoslav parliamentary elections. It offered 8,100 candidates throughout Yugoslavia. On 5 May the Yugoslav government first announced the results of the elections, which showed that 72.6 percent of the eligible electorate had cast a total of 2,778,172 ballots. The party of Bogoljub Jevtić had received 1,738,390 (62.6%) votes and 320 seats in parliament and the Opposition Bloc led by Vladko Maček had received 983,248 (35.4%) votes and 48 seats. Zbor finished last in the polls, with 23,814 (0.8%) votes, and had acquired no seats in parliament. Of all the votes it had received, 13,635 came from the Danube Banovina, in which Ljotić's home district of Smederevo was located. The election results initially published by authorities caused an upheaval amongst the public, forcing the government to publish the results of a recount on 22 May. The recount showed that 100,000 additional ballots that had not been recorded on 5 May had been cast and that Jevtić's party had received 1,746,982 (60.6%) votes and 303 seats, the Opposition Bloc had received 1,076,345 (37.4%) and 67 seats, and that Zbor had received 24,008 (0.8%) votes and again no seats.\n\nIn 1937, Ljotić began attacking Stojadinović through Zbor publications and accused him of complicity in King Alexander's assassination three years earlier. Stojadinović's government responded by exposing Ljotić as having been funded by the Germans and provided with financial resources by them to spread Nazi propaganda and promote German economic interests in Serbia. The incriminating material linking Ljotić with the Germans was given to Yugoslav authorities by German Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring, a supporter of Stojadinović. Stojadinović used these revelations to his benefit in the following year's parliamentary elections, presenting his opponents, including Ljotić, as \"disloyal agitators\". Ljotić responded by attacking Stojadinović through issues of \"Otadžbina\", many of which were subsequently banned. The Stojadinović government went on to prohibit all Zbor rallies and newspapers, confiscated Zbor propaganda material, and arrested Zbor leaders. In September 1938, Ljotić was arrested after the Yugoslav gendarmerie opened fire on a crowd of Zbor supporters, killing at least one person. A frequent churchgoer, he was charged with religious mania and briefly sent to an insane asylum before being released. On 10 October, Stojadinović dissolved the Parliament of Yugoslavia, proclaimed new elections and arranged further arrests of Zbor members. Ljotić responded by publicly stating that Zbor supporters were being arrested in order to prevent them from participating in the forthcoming elections. The parliamentary elections of December 1938 offered three candidates—Stojadinović, Maček, and Ljotić. During voting itself, members of opposition parties, including Zbor, were arrested and subjected to police intimidation and voting registers were allegedly falsified in Stojadinović's favour. Zbor finished last in the elections, receiving 30,734 (1.01%) votes, and again winning no seats in parliament. 17,573 of the votes in favour of Zbor were cast in the Danube Banovina, while the number of votes in the Dalmatian Littoral Banovina increased from 974 in May 1935 to 2,427 in December 1938.\n\nIn August 1939, Ljotić's cousin, Milan Nedić, was appointed Yugoslav Minister of Defense. Later that year, almost all Zbor publications, including \"Otadžbina\", \"Buđenje\", \"Zbor\", \"Naš put\" (Our Path) and \"Vihor\" (Whirlwind), were prohibited. Ljotić exploited the connections he had with Nedić to ensure that the banned Zbor-published journal \"Bilten\" (Bulletin) was distributed to members of the Royal Yugoslav Army. The journal was published illegally in a military printing house and distributed throughout the country by military couriers. Ljotić was the journal's main contributor and editor-in-chief. Fifty-eight issues of \"Bilten\" were published from March 1939 until October 1940, in which Ljotić advocated a pro-Axis Yugoslav foreign policy and criticized Belgrade's tolerance of Jews. As many as 20,000 copies each were printed of later issues of the journal. Ljotić was particularly pleased with being able to exert his ideological influence over young military academy trainees as well as older officers.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Ljotić supported Yugoslavia's policy of neutrality in the conflict while promoting the position that Yugoslav diplomacy should focus on relations with Berlin. He vehemently opposed the August 1939 Cvetković–Maček Agreement and repeatedly wrote letters to Prince Paul urging him to annul it. In these letters, he advocated an immediate re-organization of the government according to Zbor ideology, the abolishment of Croatian autonomy, the division of the Royal Yugoslav Army into contingents of ethnic Serbs and some Croat and Slovene volunteers, who would be armed, and contingents of most Croats and Slovenes in the armed forces, who would serve as labour units and would be unarmed. Effectively, the purpose of all these points was to reduce non-Serbs in Yugoslavia to the status of second-class citizens. By this point, Zbor was infiltrated by the German Gestapo, the Abwehr (German military intelligence), and the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS). In 1940, the Royal Yugoslav Army purged its pro-German elements and Ljotić lost much of the influence he held over the armed forces.\n\nLjotić's followers responded to the Cvetković–Maček Agreement with violence, clashing with the youth wing of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ). These incidents attracted as many as 5,000 new members to Zbor and led to the formation of a Zbor student wing known as the \"White Eagles\" (). In July 1940, Ljotić expressed his bitter opposition to the diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union by Belgrade, which was meant to strengthen Yugoslavia internally in the case of war.\n\nOn 23 October 1940, \"White Eagles\" members massed outside the campus of the University of Belgrade. University president Petar Micić was a Zbor sympathizer. The Belgrade police, who were alleged to have had foreknowledge of the riots, withdrew from the area before violence erupted. The \"White Eagles\" members then threatened faculty and students with pistols and knives, stabbed some of them, hailed Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini as their heroes and shouted \"down with the Jews!\" Members of \"Slovenski Jug\" (Slavic South), a Serbian nationalist movement, also participated in the riots, which were orchestrated by Ljotić in the hope that violence would provoke martial law and thus bring about a more centralized system of control in the university. The Serbian public responded to the riots with outrage. On 24 October, the Yugoslav government revoked Zbor's legal status. On 2 November, the Ministry of Interior sent a list of Zbor members to all municipal administrators in Serbia. The government cracked down on Zbor by detaining several hundred members, forcing Ljotić into hiding. One of the only public figures in Serbia to speak in favour of Ljotić during this period was Serbian Orthodox Bishop Nikolaj Velimirović, who praised his \"faith in God\" and \"good character\". Although a government investigation found that Zbor was guilty of high treason for accepting German funds, the authorities were careful not to arrest Ljotić in order to not provoke the Germans. Ljotić was placed under government surveillance but authorities quickly lost track of him. He hid with friends in Belgrade and remained in contact with Nedić and Velimirović. On 6 November, Nedić resigned from his post to protest the government crackdown on Zbor. Additional issues of \"Bilten\" continued to be printed despite his resignation. These supported a pro-Axis Yugoslav foreign policy, criticized the government's tolerance of Jews and Freemasons and attacked pro-British members of the government for their opposition to Yugoslavia signing the Tripartite Pact. Ljotić remained in hiding until April 1941.\n\nOn 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated. Several dozen Royal Yugoslav Army officers affiliated with Zbor were captured by the Wehrmacht during the invasion, but were quickly released. The Germans sent Ljotić a written notice assuring his freedom of movement in German-occupied Serbia. Not long after German forces entered Belgrade, Ljotić's followers were given the task of selecting an estimated 1,200 Jews from the city's non-Jewish population.\n\nUpon occupying Serbia, the Germans prohibited the activity of all political parties except Zbor. Although they originally intended to make Ljotić the head of a Serbian puppet government, both Ljotić and the Germans realized that his unpopularity would make any government led by him a failure. The Germans soon invited Ljotić to join the initial Serbian puppet government, the Commissioner Administration of Milan Aćimović. Ljotić was offered the position of economic commissioner but never took office, partly because he disliked the idea of playing a secondary role in the administration and partly because of his unpopularity. He resorted to indirectly exerting his influence over the Serbian puppet government through two of his closest associates, Zbor members Stevan Ivanić and Miloslav Vasiljević, whom the Germans had selected as commissioners. The Germans trusted Ljotić more than any other ethnic Serb in occupied Yugoslavia. In need of a reliable collaborationist force to combat the Communist uprising that had erupted in the aftermath of the German occupation of Serbia, they gave him permission to form the Serbian Volunteer Detachments in September 1941.\n\nIn October, Zbor organized the Grand Anti-Masonic Exhibition in Belgrade with German financial support. The exhibition sought to expose an alleged Judeo-Masonic and Communist conspiracy for world domination through several displays featuring antisemitic propaganda. In December, the Serbian Volunteer Detachments were renamed the Serbian Volunteer Corps (, SDK) and placed under the command of \"General der Artillerie\" (lieutenant general) Paul Bader. Although it was not formally part of the Wehrmacht, the SDK received arms, ammunition, food and clothing from the Germans. Its units were not allowed to move from their assigned territory without German authorization. Ljotić himself had no control over the SDK, which was directly commanded by Colonel Kosta Mušicki. Like the Serbian State Guard, it was under the direct command of the Higher SS and Police Leader August Meyszner and the Commanding General in Serbia. During operations its units were put under the tactical command of German divisions. It was the only group of armed Serbs that the Germans ever trusted during the war, its units often being praised for valour in action by German commanders. The SDK often helped the Gestapo track down and round up Jewish civilians who had managed to evade capture by the Germans and was involved in sending Jewish prisoners to the Banjica concentration camp.\n\nOn 15 July 1942, Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović sent a telegram to the Yugoslav government-in-exile asking them to publicly denounce Ljotić, Nedić and the openly collaborationist Chetnik leader Kosta Pećanac as traitors. The Yugoslav government-in-exile responded by doing so publicly over BBC Radio. On 4 October 1944, Ljotić, along with Nedić and about 300 Serbian government officials, escaped from Belgrade with German officials. Ljotić and the SDK arrived in Osijek by the end of October, where German official Hermann Neubacher agreed to arrange their safe passage towards the Slovenian coast. In early 1945, Chetnik leader Pavle Đurišić decided to move to the Ljubljana Gap independent of Mihailović, and arranged for Ljotić's forces already in Slovenia to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement. Between March and April, Ljotić and Mihailović exchanged messages concerning a last-ditch alliance against the Partisans. Although the agreement was reached too late to be of any practical use, the forces of Ljotić and Mihailović came together under the command of Chetnik General Miodrag Damjanović on 27 March.\n\nLjotić did not live to see the end of the war. He was killed in a car accident in Slovenia on 23 April 1945. In early May, Damjanović led most of the troops under his command into northwestern Italy, where they surrendered to the British and were placed in detention camps. Many were extradited to Yugoslavia, where an estimated 1,500–3,100 were executed by the Partisans and buried in mass graves in the Kočevski Rog plateau. Others immigrated to western countries, where they established émigré organizations intended to promote Zbor's political agenda. Many of Ljotić's followers settled in Munich, where they ran their own publishing house and printed a newspaper called \"Iskra\" (Spark). In 1974, Ljotić's brother was shot and killed by agents of the Yugoslav State Security Service (\"Uprava državne bezbednosti\", UDBA). The antagonism between pro-Ljotić groups and those affiliated with the Chetniks continued in exile.\n\n"}
