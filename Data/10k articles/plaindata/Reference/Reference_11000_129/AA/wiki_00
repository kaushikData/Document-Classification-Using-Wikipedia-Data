{"id": "667642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=667642", "title": "Billy Bunter", "text": "Billy Bunter\n\nWilliam George \"Billy\" Bunter is a fictional schoolboy created by Charles Hamilton using the pen name Frank Richards. He features in stories set at Greyfriars School, originally published in the boys' weekly story paper \"The Magnet\" from 1908 to 1940. Subsequently, Bunter has appeared in novels, on television, in stage plays, and in comic strips.\n\nHe is in the Lower Fourth form of Greyfriars School, known as the Remove, whose members are 14–15 years of age. Originally a minor character, his role was expanded over the years with his antics being heavily used in the stories to provide comic relief and to drive forward the plots.\n\nBunter's defining characteristic is his greediness and dramatically overweight appearance. His character is, in many respects, a highly obnoxious anti-hero. As well as his gluttony, he is also obtuse, lazy, racist, inquisitive, deceitful, slothful, self-important and conceited. These defects, however, are not recognised by Bunter. In his own mind, he is an exemplary character: handsome, talented and aristocratic; and he dismisses most of those around him as \"beasts\". Even so, the negative sides of Bunter are offset by several genuine redeeming features; such as his tendency, from time to time, to display courage in aid of others; his ability to be generous, on the rare occasions when he has food or cash; and above all his very real love and concern for his mother. All these, combined with Bunter's cheery optimism, his comically transparent untruthfulness and inept attempts to conceal his antics from his schoolmasters and schoolfellows, combine to make a character that succeeds in being highly entertaining but which rarely attracts the reader's lasting sympathy.\n\nCharles Hamilton invented the character for an unpublished story in the late 1890s. He claimed Bunter was derived from three persons: a corpulent editor, a short-sighted relative, and another relative who was perpetually trying to raise a loan.\n\nThe identity of the fat editor is unclear: various sources suggest either Lewis Ross Higgins, editor of a number of comic papers and who is described as resembling the author G. K. Chesterton; or Percy Griffith, the original editor of \"The Magnet\". The short sighted relative was Hamilton's younger sister Una, who had suffered poor sight since childhood, and who had been wont to \"peer at him somewhat like an Owl\"; while the other relative was his older brother Alex, who was described as \"generally anxious to borrow a pound or two\" on the strength of the anticipated arrival of a cheque that never materialised.\n\nBilly Bunter appeared in 1,670 of the 1,683 issues of \"The Magnet\" published during the 32-year period from 1908 to 1940. He was introduced in Magnet No. 1 \"The Making of Harry Wharton\" (1908) as a minor character, but developed into one of the principal characters of the stories as author Charles Hamilton realised his comic potential.\n\nGeorge Orwell described him as \"...a real creation. His tight trousers against which boots and canes are constantly thudding, his astuteness in search of food, his postal order which never turns up, have made him famous wherever the Union Jack waves.\" \n\nIn addition to stories set at Greyfriars School, his adventures also included many travel series, with trips to China, India, Egypt, Sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil, Hollywood and the South Seas.\n\nIn his first appearance, Billy Bunter was introduced thus:\n\nBunter's big round spectacles and rolling gait earned him the nickname the \"Owl of the Remove\".\n\nIn the early stories, both Bunter and classmate Johnny Bull were described as \"stout\" in appearance; and it was Magnet illustrator C. H. Chapman who first put Bunter into checked-pattern trousers to distinguish the two characters. With the passage of time, the illustrations would show Bunter's circumference as ever more pronounced, while Johnny Bull would become indistinguishable from the other schoolboys.\n\nA list of the members of the Remove (Lower Fourth) form was published in Magnet #1659 \"Billy Bunter's Bargain\" (1939), and provided the boys' ages, heights, and weights. Billy Bunter's age is given as 15 years 1 month; his height as 4 ft 9ins; and his weight as 14 stone 12 1/2 lb.\n\nOn many levels, Bunter's character is deeply unattractive. He is the living embodiment of several of the seven deadly sins: pride, envy, avarice, sloth and, most especially, greed and gluttony. Added to these, Bunter is also inquisitive, deceitful and obtuse. However these traits are softened by Bunter's cheery optimism, his comically transparent untruthfulness and his reliable ineptitude when attempting to conceal his antics from his schoolfellows and schoolmasters.\n\nFrom the very first Magnet story, Bunter suffers an ongoing shortage of cash and is forever attempting to borrow money from his schoolfellows, explaining that he is expecting a postal order from one of his \"titled relations\". Over the course of stories spanning several decades, Bunter's celebrated postal order almost never materialises; and the subject becomes a long-running cause of hilarity in the Greyfriars Remove. Even so, Bunter is a skilful and persistent borrower and succeeds in extracting countless loans from his schoolfellows. Wealthier schoolboys such as Lord Mauleverer frequently part with a few shillings to be rid of Bunter; but even the notoriously tight-fisted American junior Fisher T Fish was persuaded to loan Bunter cash on at least one occasion.\n\nBunter's morals are peculiarly his own. He has every intention of repaying the cash he borrows, but allows such debts to linger for months and even years. He is obsessed with food – the sweeter and stickier, the better – and is utterly unscrupulous in helping himself to his schoolfellows' sweets, cakes and hampers, for which he earns countless kickings. But despite his complete lack of morals in such matters, Bunter is otherwise as honest as any other Greyfriars schoolboy. He would never dream of deliberately stealing money or valuables.\n\nIn the early stories, Bunter was associated with his stammering stock phrase: \"I'm s-sincerely sorry\". As his character developed, the stammering would disappear; and the stock phrase would be replaced by the greeting \"\"I say, you fellows!”\", the reproachful \"“Oh really, Wharton!”\" (or whichever character he is addressing), the anguished exclamation \"“Yaroooh!”\" and the distinctive giggle \"“He, he, he!”\" \n\nAlthough Bunter has a keen sense of his own self-importance, this is rarely shared by anyone else at Greyfriars. A notable exception occurs in a 1932 story, when an election for a new Remove Form Captain takes place. The support of the form divides equally between two candidates, leaving Bunter with the casting vote. His support is keenly solicited by supporters of both camps, and Bunter becomes the centre of attention – a position he exploits to the full. In a conversation with his study mate Peter Todd, Bunter's view of the two candidates offers an insight into his priorities in life:\n\nIn the classroom, Bunter's academic abilities are scarce to the point of non-existent. He is the despair of his Form master, Mr Quelch. In this he is not helped by his extreme laziness and unwillingness to indulge in any academic work whatsoever.\n\nBunter's personal habits are lazy and slovenly. He is always the last to rise from his bed in the morning and always chooses to remain in bed for a few extra minutes in preference to washing himself. His handkerchief is permanently filthy and his waistcoat usually displays prominent clues that reveal the ingredients of his breakfast that day.\n\nA running theme at the beginning of each holiday season is Bunter's persistent attempts to avoid spending vacations with his family and instead gatecrash the holiday arrangements of one or more of his schoolfellows; and his schoolfellows' (generally unsuccessful) attempts to avoid Bunter's company.\n\nHe has two gifts: for cooking, and an uncanny ability to imitate voices (described as ventriloquism in the stories). This talent was developed in the early Magnet stories, commencing with Magnet No. 32 \"The Greyfriars Ventriloquist\" (1908). In a series of stories in which Bunter unsuccessfully attempts, in turn, a physical exercise regime, hypnotism, and mind reading, a visiting ventriloquism show inspires Bunter to believe that he is a born ventriloquist. \"More like a born idiot\" comments Bob Cherry – but Bunter perseveres and eventually masters the art. It is a talent unappreciated by his schoolfellows, since he generally uses it to make mischief, or, opportunistically, to get himself out of trouble.\n\nAmong Bunter's few virtues is an occasional tendency to display courage for the sake of others. To his credit, he is invariably in a state of extreme terror himself on such occasions. This characteristic was first seen in Magnet No. 364 \"Surprising the School\" (1915) when he saved his schoolmaster's niece, Cora Quelch, from an angry bull and was afterwards repeated on a number of other occasions. Unfortunately, Bunter's love of the limelight frequently leads him to spoil matters by boasting and exaggerating afterwards. Oddly enough, he also displays generosity, on the rare occasions when he is in possession of food or cash.\n\nBilly Bunter's main redeeming feature is the very genuine love and concern he has for his mother. This is seen in several stories, usually involving his mother suffering an illness, allowing a better side of Bunter's character to be seen. (Magnets #1016, #1206 and #1532).\n\nFor the first fifteen years of the Magnet stories, Bunter was one of the crowd. From the mid-1920s, just as Hamilton increasingly developed Bunter's comic potential, so he began to use Bunter's antics as a means to initiate and drive forward the plots.\n\nConspiratorial conversations would be overheard by Bunter, whether from the other side of a keyhole or from under the seat in a rail compartment while avoiding the ticket inspector. Bunter would frequently be under a table, or behind an armchair – often hiding from some outraged fellow whose food he had purloined – there to overhear some secret or piece of gossip. Such knowledge would swiftly be shared through Bunter's habit of gossiping. Letters would be purloined by Bunter and not reach the intended recipient. Bunter's ventriloquism skills would be used as a means of creating conflict between other characters. Whilst he was usually not the main protagonist in most of the stories, Bunter's influence as a comical interlude and as a plot driver was felt at every turn.\n\nIn The Secret Seven series of 1934, the entire plotline is initiated by Bunter's stupidity, which causes a road accident that results in a number of leading characters being hospitalised.\n\nDuring \"The Magnet\" era, Billy Bunter is not yet the permanent principal character he would become in the post-war era. The style of the stories is to allow each principal character to take a leading role in turn. Stronger characters such as Remove Captain Harry Wharton, the hard and rebellious Herbert Vernon-Smith and Fifth form duffer Horace Coker are frequently given leading roles in their own series; and even lesser characters such as American junior Fisher T Fish and aspiring actor William Wibley would occasionally be brought to the fore in their own series.\n\nIn this way, Bunter took his turn with the rest, in a number of stories that placed him as the lead protagonist. Some of the more notable examples include:\n\n\nIn 1929, the editors of \"The Magnet\" persuaded Charles Hamilton to drop the character of Billy Bunter altogether for several editions and attempt a storyline in the style of an action thriller. The result was the \"Ravenspur Grange\" series (Magnets #1122 to #1125) which prompted a strong outcry from the \"Magnet\" readership, dismayed at Bunter's disappearance. Billy Bunter would never be absent from the stories again.\n\nBunter himself often uses language that contemporary readers would characterise as racist. However, this attribute applies to Bunter himself rather than the stories in general in which both the protagonists and the narrative of the Greyfriars stories are unusually firm in rejecting racism.\n\nIn an age when the word \"nigger\" was not yet regarded in the same pejorative sense that applies today, the Greyfriars stories consistently emphasised the offensive nature of the term from as early as 1922 and the narratives even included unfashionable anti-British sentiments in stories set against the background of imperial India.\n\nBilly Bunter has two siblings: a younger sister, Elizabeth Gertrude (Bessie), who attends the nearby Cliff House School, and a younger brother, Samuel Tuckless (Sammy), who is in the Second Form at Greyfriars School. Bessie first appears in the Magnet No. 582 \"The Artful Dodger\" (1919), before appearing as a regular character in \"The School Friend\" later that year. Bessie appears in a total of 116 \"Magnet\" stories. Sammy Bunter first appears in Magnet #144 \"Billy Bunter's Minor\" (1910) and appears in a further 291 \" Magnet\" stories.\n\nThere is little love lost between the three, as is shown in this passage from one of the earlier stories:\n\nTheir father is Mr William Samuel Bunter, a portly, largely unsuccessful, stockbroker with a severe manner; although it is noted that \"like many middle aged gentlemen, Mr. Bunter was better tempered after breakfast.\" He is perpetually complaining about income tax and school fees and has little interest in his children. Written correspondence between Billy and his father consists of continual requests from Billy to supplement his pocket money; and continual refusals from his father to accede. By contrast, Billy Bunter is particularly close to his mother, Mrs Amelia Bunter, a kindly lady who appears only briefly in seven stories.\n\nBilly's cousin Walter Gilbert (Wally) Bunter was introduced in Magnet No. 333 \"The Dark Horse\" (1914) and appears in a further 32 \"Magnet\" stories. He is Billy's exact double, excepting only for his spectacles, but is his opposite in every other respect.\n\nOther members of the Bunter family to appear briefly over the years include Billy Bunter's uncles James, George and Claude, his aunts Prudence and Claribel, his great-aunt Eliza Judith and (in a one-off story) Sir Foulkes Bunter and his son.\n\nBunter boasts of living at Bunter Court, a stately home with liveried servants and a fleet of chauffeured Rolls-Royce cars. On closer inspection, however, this turns out to be the more modest Bunter Villa in Surrey, with a maid, a cook and a single Ford car.\nMany stories which had originally seen publication in \"The Magnet\" were reprinted in the Schoolboys Own Libraries before World War II and again by Armada and Paul Hamlyn in the 1970s. Most of the 1,683 issues of \"The Magnet\" were reprinted in hardback form by publisher W. Howard Baker, under his Howard Baker and Greyfriars Book Club imprints, between 1969 and 1990.\n\nFollowing the closure of \"The Magnet\" in 1940, Hamilton had little work; but he became known as the author of the Greyfriars stories following a newspaper interview he gave to the London \"Evening Standard\".\n\nAlthough he had written many thousands of stories published between 1900 and 1940 by the Amalgamated Press, he had written them under dozens of pen names: so he himself was quite unknown prior to the appearance of the newspaper article. Nor was it even widely known, until then, that all of the stories written under those pen names were, in the main, all the work of one man.\n\nHamilton was not able to continue the Greyfriars saga immediately, as the Amalgamated Press claimed ownership to all the characters except Billy Bunter who actually appeared in a Sparshott story in 1946. However, by 1947 they had relented, and Hamilton was then able to obtain a contract from publishers Charles Skilton for a series of hardback novels. The first of these, \"Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School\", was published in September 1947. It began a series that continued for the rest of Hamilton's life. In the 1950s the initial novels were reprinted by Cassells, who took over publication of the series, which continued until 1967, the final novels being published posthumously.\n\nBilly Bunter has been adapted for radio as an audio play several times, the last occasion being a 90 minute adaptation of the novel \"Billy Bunter's Christmas Party\" broadcast on BBC Radio 4, as part of the series \"Saturday Night Theatre\", in December 1986.\n\nIn the 1990s, a series of short stories adapted from the novels of Charles Hamilton were performed by \"The Goodies\" (Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie, Tim Brooke-Taylor) for BBC radio, as six 15 minute dramas\n\nA radio documentary about the character aired on the 40th anniversary of the closure of \"The Magnet\"\n\nBilly Bunter was played by Gerald Campion in the BBC television series \"Billy Bunter of Greyfriars School\". The series also featured Anthony Valentine as Harry Wharton, Michael Crawford as Frank Nugent, Jeremy Bulloch as Bob Cherry, Melvyn Hayes as Harold Skinner, John Woodnutt Raf De La Torre, Kynaston Reeves and Jack Melford as Mr Quelch, Roger Delgado as Monsieur Charpentier and Kenneth Cope as school bully Gerald Loder.\n\nA total of 52 half-hour episodes was broadcast over seven series, between 1952 and 1961, including three television specials. The television show was totally centred on Bunter, with the other characters playing only a peripheral role.\n\nAll the television scripts were written by Charles Hamilton. The programme's memorable theme music was the \"Portsmouth\" section of Ralph Vaughan Williams's \"Sea Songs\". The episodes were transmitted \"live\" in black and white format, and a dozen still exist in the BBC's archive as telerecordings (see also Wiping). The survivors are the complete third series (six episodes), one of the \"specials\", one episode from the fifth series, and four episodes from the sixth series.\n\nBilly Bunter appeared in several Christmas stage shows with different casts:\n\nAfter \"The Magnet\" closed in 1940, Bunter appeared in children's comics, as a strip cartoon character: initially, from 15 June 1940, he appeared in \"Knockout\" (which, like \"The Magnet,\" was published by The Amalgamated Press). Although \"Knockout\" had begun only in 1939, it already had a circulation several times that of \"The Magnet\". C H Chapman, the last illustrator for \"The Magnet\", drew the first nine \"Knockout\" strips in 1939, after which several artists were tried, before Frank Minnitt established himself with a beaming and bouncy Bunter, which at first followed Chapman's style, then later branched into a style of his own, concentrating on slapstick humour. Soon the Famous Five vanished from the strip, replaced by Jones minor, who had all the good qualities Bunter lacked, but who was prone to being led astray by Bunter. The form-master, Mr Quelch, stayed (at least in name), but he lost his dignity and aloofness.\n\nMinnitt continued producing the strip until his death in 1958. Reg Parlett then took over until \"Knockout\" ceased publication in 1961, when the strip transferred to \"Valiant\" comic, and then to \"TV Comic\", where it ran until 1984. Bunter also appeared in many \"Knockout\" annuals, even on some covers.\n\nC. H. Chapman drew a strip for \"The Comet\" comic in 1956, which featured the classical old Bunter of \"The Magnet\" and the Famous Five, consisting of twelve weeks of 2-page strips (24 pages in all). Altogether, Bunter's appearances in \"Comet\" lasted from March 1950 until June 1958, with picture stories from February 1952.\n\nFrom 1955, Billy Bunter comic strips were published in the Netherlands, in the Dutch-language comic \"Sjors\", with the character renamed \"Billie Turf\". Bunter thus became one of the house characters of that comic and its successors, and so continued appearing in anthology-style collections in Dutch until the end of the 20th century. \"Billie Turf\" comic strip albums were published from 1963 onwards, and have continued into the 21st century. Three Billie Turf movies were made between 1978 and 1983, mostly spelling the name of the main character as \"Billy Turf\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6838727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6838727", "title": "Comparison of rugby league and rugby union", "text": "Comparison of rugby league and rugby union\n\nA comparison of rugby league and rugby union is possible because of the games' similarities and shared origins.\n\nInitially, following the 1895 split in rugby football, rugby league and rugby union differed in administration only. Soon, however, the rules of rugby league were modified, resulting in two distinctly different forms of rugby. After 100 years, in 1995 rugby union joined rugby league and most other forms of football as an openly professional sport.\n\nThe inherent similarities between rugby league and rugby union have at times led to the possibility of a merger of the two variants and experimental hybrid games have been played that use a mix of the two sports' rules.\n\nRugby union was originally referred to as rugby football. During the early development of rugby football different schools used different rules, on many occasions agreeing upon them shortly before commencement of the game. In 1871, English clubs met to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). Rugby football spread to Australia and New Zealand, with games being played in the early to mid nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1892, charges of professionalism were laid against Yorkshire clubs after they compensated players for missing work. A proposal to pay players up to six shillings when they missed work because of match commitments was voted down by the RFU. On 27 August 1895, prominent Lancashire clubs declared that they would support their Yorkshire colleagues in their proposal to form a professional organization and the Northern Rugby Football Union, usually called the Northern Union (NU), was formed. The rugby union authorities issued sanctions against clubs, players and officials involved in the offshoot group, including amateurs who played with or against Northern Union sides. After the schism the separate codes were named \"rugby union\" for the RFU code and \"rugby league\" for the NU code.\n\nIn 1906, All Black George William Smith joined with Albert Henry Baskerville to form a team of professional rugby players. George Smith cabled a friend in Sydney and three professional matches were arranged between a New South Wales rugby team before continuing onto the UK. This game was played under the rugby union laws and it was not until the team, nicknamed the All Golds, arrived in Leeds that they learnt the new Northern Union laws. Meanwhile, in Sydney a meeting was organised to look at forming a professional rugby competition in Australia. The meeting resolved that a \"New South Wales Rugby Football League\" (NSWRFL) should be formed, to play the Northern Union rules. The first season of the NSWRFL competition was played in 1908, and has continued to be played every year since.\n\nDuring rugby league's 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, the Northern Rugby Football Union tried to arrange a match in Paris, but opposition from the Rugby Football Union-aligned French Rugby Federation made it impossible. In France rugby league split from rugby union in the 1930s. In 1948 the French instigated the formation of the International Rugby League Board as the world governing body for rugby league. France, New Zealand, Britain and Australia (who joined a few months later) were the founding countries. The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) had formed prior to the schism in 1886 and remained the international governing body for rugby union, although it originally only consisted of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. Australia, New Zealand and South Africa joined the IRFB in 1948, France in 1978 and Argentina, Canada, Italy and Japan in 1991.\n\nOn 26 August 1995 the IRFB, now known as the International Rugby Board, declared rugby union an \"open\" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game. According to \"The New York Times\" at the time, \"Thirteen-man rugby league has shown itself to be a faster, more open game of better athletes than the other code. Rugby union is trying to negotiate its own escape from amateurism, with some officials admitting that the game is too slow, the laws too convoluted to attract a larger TV following\".\n\nAlthough both rugby codes are forms of football, in many places, it could cause confusion as \"football\" is understood to mean Association football, Gridiron football, Gaelic football or Australian rules football depending on the country (or indeed region of the country). In much of the rugby union-playing world, the sport of rugby league is infrequently played and rugby union is commonly known simply as \"rugby\"; in countries where both codes are played, there is a need to distinguish between the codes of rugby.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, rugby union or rugby league fans rarely refer to their sport as \"football\" as in most cases this would refer to association football. Across the United Kingdom, rugby union is usually referred to simply as 'rugby' but in the North of England, the word 'rugby' could refer to either sport, but usually means \"rugby league\". The nickname \"rugger\", which developed in England's elite schools, almost always refers to rugby union.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, rugby league is usually known as \"league\" or \"football\" with the latter term potentially confusing as Australian rules football and Association football could also be called football. Rugby union is often simply referred to as \"rugby\" without the ambiguity that this term carries in the UK.\n\nIn France, rugby union is called \"rugby à quinze\" (rugby with 15) or simply \"rugby\" whilst rugby league is known as \"rugby à treize\" (rugby with 13) or \"jeu à treize\" (game with 13) or \"treize\" (13).\n\nSince the 1895 schism, changes have taken place to the laws of both rugby union and rugby league football so that now they are distinct sports. The laws of rugby league football have been gradually changed with the aim of creating a faster, more spectator-friendly sport. Player numbers were reduced to thirteen a side, creating more space for attacking play, and rucks and mauls were replaced with a play-the-ball restart. Changes to the laws of rugby union have been less extreme, although there have been adjustments in scoring as the game became more try-oriented rather than focusing on goals. In 2009 major law changes were implemented with the aim of making union simpler and more open. Rugby league historian Tony Collins has written that since turning professional in the mid 1990s, rugby union has increasingly borrowed techniques and tactics from rugby league.\n\nRugby union has more laws than rugby league and it has been described as being a more complex game. Rugby league in turn has been described as a simpler game that is easier for spectators to understand. Mat Rogers, an Australian dual-code rugby international player, has said \"Rugby [union] is very complicated and rugby league is much more simple in comparison\". England's Chris Ashton, also a dual international, has said that union has \"more of a tactical side, more that can happen in a game\". Ireland's Tom Court has said \"Rugby Union is a complex game with certain closed skills like scrummaging and line-out lifting and rugby league requires a higher level of fitness to compete at the highest level\".\n\nThe two forms of rugby share the same basic rules of the game and use a similar-shaped ovoid ball. The aim is to score more points through tries, conversions, penalty goals and drop goals than the opposition within the 80 minutes of play.\n\nGoals are scored when the ball is kicked between the two posts and over the cross-bar, either during open play or as the result of a penalty. A try is scored when the ball is touched down on or beyond the defending team's goal-line. The try-scoring side is given the chance to score two additional points by kicking a conversion similar to a penalty goal attempt from a point along a line which is perpendicular to the place where the try had been scored.\n\nThe ball can be taken forward in three ways — by kicking, by a player running with it, or as the result of a set-piece. The ball can be passed from hand to hand between teammates in a backward or sideways direction; it may not be passed forwards although it can be kicked forwards. Dropping the ball in a forwards direction results in a scrum, a set-piece that restarts the game, except on the sixth tackle in league where the game restarts with a handover to the opposition.\n\nOnly the player holding the ball may be tackled. A rugby tackle is an attempt to bring the ball carrier to the ground or to stop his forward progress. Play restarts with the ball being transferred to another player.\n\nThe playing positions are divided into \"backs\" — generally faster and more mobile who score most of the points, and the larger, stronger \"forwards\" who are involved in the more physical aspects of rugby and generally do more tackling.\n\nA big difference in gameplay between the two games is that rugby league has shed from its laws several opportunities for possession to be contested that rugby union has retained: contesting the ball after the tackle, on the ground in rucks and through mauls. When the ball goes into touch, possession in rugby union is contested through a line-out, while in rugby league a scrum restarts play. The lesser focus on contesting possession means there are fewer stoppages of play in rugby league, with the ball typically in play for 50 out of the 80 minutes compared to around 35 for professional rugby union. As the ball is in play more and there are fewer players (13 compared to 15) to cover the field it has been implied that rugby league is the more physically demanding sport.\n\nIn union the attacking team can hold onto and use the ball for as long as they are able, while the opposition's aim is to take possession of the ball from them. In league each team can be tackled six times before handing over possession; moreover, the action stops after each successful tackle (i.e., the ball is not contested after a tackle). After being tackled five times, the attacking team will usually kick the ball either in an attacking kick or for territory. As the ball can only be contested during a one on one tackle in league there is less scope for a turnover to occur than in rugby union. A study commissioned by the IRB found that between the years 2002 and 2004 possession was retained by the attacking team in 13 out of 14 tackles in rugby union. Collins has argued that the six tackle rule in rugby league offers a more even distribution of possession despite fewer opportunities to contest it. In both games the attacking team loses possession if they drop or pass the ball forward, which results in a scrum being awarded to the defending team.\n\nIn union possession can also be contested at line-outs (played after the ball has gone into touch) and scrums. In the same study it was found that the team with the ball at a scrum regained possession 90 percent of the time, while the team with the ball at a lineout regained possession 80 percent of the time. League does not have a lineout, but does utilise a scrum to restart play. It is uncommon for modern rugby league scrums to be contested, with the side awarded the scrum almost always gaining possession. Possession can also be contested following kicks to restart play from the halfway, 22 metre in both games (and from the goal line in league). Generally league restarts are likely to go for distance unless possession is needed quickly (usually if a team is behind with very little time left to play). Union restarts are more likely to be short to allow players to contest possession in the air.\n\nPossession may change the same ways in both games:\n\nPossession may change in rugby league in a number of unique ways:\n\nPossession may change in rugby union in a number of unique ways\n\nIn both games tackling is permitted to either bring down the player in possession of the ball or prevent him from making forward progress. Tackling or interfering with a player who is not in possession of the ball is not permitted. Tripping with the leg is not allowed in either code. However, in rugby league, if a tackling player has both hands on the ball carrier, he is allowed to use his legs to bring him to ground.\n\nIn rugby league, a tackle is deemed to be complete when the elbow of the arm holding the ball touches the ground, or the player is held in an upright tackle. The ball cannot be further advanced and a play-the-ball or handover must take place. In rugby union, a tackle is deemed to be complete when the player in possession is held on the ground; that player must play the ball (either releasing it, passing it, or if over the try line grounding the ball) immediately. In rugby league a play the ball takes place after each tackle. In rugby union, play does not stop when a player is forced to the ground in a tackle, as the tackled player must immediately play the ball, and the tackler must roll away, which will generally mean a ruck will form.\n\nThe laws of rugby league specifically outlaw the so-called \"voluntary tackle\": players are not allowed to go to ground unless they are effectively tackled by an opponent, though in practice this rule is rarely applied. There was no equivalent law in rugby union, in the past going to ground with the ball and protecting it was practised, but in the modern game deliberately falling on the ground to gain an advantage is outlawed by Law 14: \"The game is to be played by players who are on their feet. A player must not make the ball unplayable by falling down.\" A player who falls to ground with the ball or on it must immediately release or pass the ball, or get up with it.\n\nUnion and league have the same ways of scoring, but there are significant differences in the points awarded, and a few minor differences in the laws governing the scoring of tries.\n\nThe try is the main way of scoring in both codes; there are some subtle differences between the two codes, but the most obvious difference is that a try is worth 5 points in rugby union and 4 points in rugby league. In both games, a conversion following a try is worth 2 points. A player tackled just short of the try-line in rugby union can legitimately reach across it and place the ball down for a try. This is not allowed in rugby league unless the momentum of the player continues to take him over the line in one continuous movement. If the tackle is complete, such a move would constitute a \"double movement\" and the try would be disallowed.\n\nA drop goal is worth 3 points in union and 1 in league. A penalty goal is worth 3 points in union and 2 points in league.\n\nUse of a penalty box (or \"sin bin\") was introduced by rugby league in 1980. Rugby union had been experimenting with the same concept since 1979, although it was not formally sanctioned until 2001.\n\nVideo referee technology was first used for rugby league in 1996 and for rugby union in 2001.\n\nIn rugby league the ball may be thrown or knocked out of play deliberately, while in union those are penalty offences. Kicking the ball out of play is legal in both codes.\n\nWhen taking free or penalty kicks with a \"tap and go\" option, rugby league permits a stylised kick with the ball being tapped against the foot or lower leg while union requires the ball to leave the hands of the kicker. This difference in emphasis on a relatively trivial phase of play can be seen as indicative of the core differences between the games. In league, the kick is stylised as its purpose is to restart the game and to move to the run and tackle main play as quickly as possible. In union, where \"every\" phase of play has some element of competition, the trivial need to release the ball at any kick can result in a fumble that may give the opposition a chance to either contest possession or, if \"knocked-on\", will cause them to be awarded a scrum.\n\nA rugby league pitch is between 112 and 122 metres long by 68 m wide. The distance between try-lines is always 100 metres. There are lines going across the field which mark every ten metres. An in-goal area extends six to eleven metres beyond each goal line. At the goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: drop goal, penalty and conversion.\n\nA rugby union pitch is a maximum of 144 metres long by 70 m wide. The length from try line to try line is always 100 metres: the only varying distances on a rugby union field are the width of the playing field, and the distance from try line to the dead-ball line. Lines are painted at the dead-ball line, try line, 22-metre line, 10-metre line (broken line) and halfway. Lines are also located 5 metres away from the try line and touch line and 15 metres away from the touch line. At the goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: drop goal, penalty and conversion.\n\nDespite the two different pitch sizes since the removal restrictions on professionalism by the RFU in 1995, it has been possible for clubs to share facilities, including pitches. A notable example is Leeds Rhinos and Yorkshire Carnegie, both part of the Leeds Rugby group, who share Headingley Stadium.\n\nA maximum of 15 players can play rugby union at any one time whereas rugby league permits 13 players. In both games, the positions are divided into \"backs\" and \"forwards\".\n\nMany of the positions have similar names but in practice are very different. The position known as 'flanker' is not in rugby league; however the second row in rugby league are loose like the flankers in rugby union while the lock / loose forward in rugby league is similar to the number 8 in rugby union. In the backs, rugby league centres are split into left and right centre rather than inside and outside centres.\n\nThe reduction in the importance of the scrum and the removal of the line-out from rugby league, has meant it is a faster free flowing game. Very different skill sets and body types needed for the different positions has become more obvious as union players specialise more. For instance, props and hookers in rugby union tend to be among the physically strongest and heaviest players with high levels of scrummaging and mauling skills, but traditionally with limited speed and ball-handling skills. In rugby league, props are physically big, straight running forwards whose job it is to set the platform and get the go forward while still possessing agility and good ball handling skills. Locks in union tend to be very tall and high jumpers, as this helps at line-outs; while as this is not a necessity for league; the two second rowers and the loose forward / lock are mobile with speed across the park who can off-load on attack and contain and enforce on defence. They are similar to the loose forward trio of flankers and number eight in rugby union. Depending on their speed and ball playing skills, lock forwards in rugby league can generally play as both a forward and as an extra five-eight.\n\nScrum-half is a specialized position in rugby union and similar to the hooker in league: the number 9 initiates most moves by his or her team and must be an excellent passer of the ball in rugby union as with league. In rugby league any player can act from dummy half, however, in the professional modern game it is a specialised job for the hooker to instigate and direct the forward platform. He must also be able to probe with a running and varied kicking game from dummy half while still possessing strong and effective tackling.\n\nThe similarity between the two games has meant that players can switch between the two codes. League initially recruited big name players from union, like Herbert \"Dally\" Messenger in 1907, and the RFU responded by banning any player that played rugby league for life. A push into converting union players to rugby league, such as All Blacks John Gallagher, Frano Botica, Matthew Ridge and Va'aiga Tuigamala, occurred during the late 1980s and into the 1990s. When rugby union became professional league players were allowed to play for rugby union teams, leading to a reversal in cross-code switching. Gallagher, Botica and Tuigamala returned to union, while leading league players such as Jason Robinson, Wendell Sailor, Mat Rogers, Lote Tuqiri, Henry Paul and Iestyn Harris, took up rugby union contracts. Sailor, Rogers, Tuqiri, Paul and Harris subsequently switched back to rugby league. Players who achieve play international rugby in both codes are known as dual-code internationals.\n\nIn 1909, when the new \"Northern Union\" code was still in its infancy, a match between the Kangaroos and the Wallabies was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the rugby league side winning, 29–26. With the wartime Emergency League suspended, Leeds Rugby League reverted to rugby union during World War I to play a one-off challenge game against the Royal Navy Depot from Plymouth in 1917. This was precursor to the following Christmas when two Challenge games were organised between the two sides but this time with one of each code. The Navy won the union game, 9–3, on Christmas Eve but proved equally adept at league recording a 24–3 win on 28 December. During World War II, the RFU relaxed its restrictions on rugby league players playing rugby union. In 1943, a Northern Command army rugby league side defeated a Northern Command union side, 18–11, at Headingley under rugby union laws. The following year a Combined Services rugby league side beat a Combined Services union side, 15–10, at Bradford again at rugby union. These were the only league v union matches played until 1996.\n\nWith both sports becoming professional matches between union and league teams have been played. In May 1996, Bath Rugby and Wigan RLFC, who were then England's top union and league sides respectively, made history by playing against each other at both codes of rugby. Wigan won, 82–6, in the first match, played under league rules, and lost the second, 44–19, under union rules. Since then other games have been played between union and league teams using the laws of one of the codes, or in some cases using a different set of laws for each half.\n\nSince the two match series in 1996, there has only been one similar endeavour to bring together union and league. In January 2003, St Helens rugby league took on Sale rugby union in a single game played at Knowsley Road, intended to have one half under league rules and the other under union rules. Unlike Bath, who were to all intents and purposes still the amateur side they had been, Sale had the benefit of almost a decade of professionalism to improve both strength and fitness that was necessary for them to adapt to the constant tackling required in rugby league. Sale prevailed against St Helens in front of a fierce St Helens home crowd at Knowsley Road, winning the match 41–39.\n\nTraditionally, the two rugbys have been seen as divided along class lines, with union associated more with the middle class, and league with the working class. One of the main reasons for the split was union's enforcement of the amateur principle, meaning that working class players could not afford to take time off work to play the sport.\n\nIn England, rugby union is widely regarded as an \"establishment\" sport, played mostly by members of the upper and middle classes. For example, many students at public schools play rugby union. In contrast, rugby league has traditionally been seen as a working class pursuit.\n\nIn Wales, rugby union is associated with small village teams which consisted of coal miners and other industrial workers playing on their days off.\n\nIn Australia, the two codes were also strongly divided down class lines. Support for both codes is concentrated in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The same perceived class barrier as exists between the two games in England also occurs in these states, fostered by rugby union's prominence and support at private schools.\n\nIn New Zealand, rugby league is still considered to be a lower class game by many, or a game for \"westies\" referring to lower class western suburbs of Auckland and more recently the poorer southern Auckland where the game is popular. It is also popular on the West Coast of New Zealand. \n\nIn France, rugby union is widely played and has a strong tradition in the Basque, Occitan, and Catalan areas along the border regions between Spain and France. It rivals the popularity of association football. Rugby league has historically been played in much the same region. \n\nIn the UK, the \"two codes\" of rugby are very different in scale and turnover. The turnover of the RFL was reported as £19m in 2014. For comparison, the turnover of the Rugby Football Union in 2014 was £150m. The number of rugby union players in England is 1.99 million (predominantly school and children's teams following a RFU drive to increase participation) but which includes 131,000 senior male players. The number of players participating in any capacity in Rugby League in England (including wheelchair users) is about 100,000.\n\nAustralia in 2013, rugby league had 1,430,367 participants in the sport (including school clinics), and 167,533 registered players. The Australian Rugby League Commission reported a gross revenue of $185,668,873 and a gross profit of $4,675,845 in the 2012 financial year. Rugby Union in 2012 had 323,115 participants, including 50,000 registered juniors. The ARU in 2012 had gross revenues of $96.6M, but had a net deficit of $8.3M. A significant portion of Rugby Union's revenue is derived from the national team touring overseas and visiting tours, while Rugby League's is largely generated by its strong domestic league.\n\nThe number of rugby union players in New Zealand is estimated to be 129,000, with 35,721 playing rugby league.\n\nRugby union generally has a broader reach around the world, largely due to the unrestricted spread of the game across commonwealth countries, promulgated by British armed forces, during a time when the armed forces inexplicably banned rugby league in the early 20th century. For example, it is a popular sport in a number of countries such as South Africa and Argentina.\n\nThe oldest international rugby union competition is the Six Nations Championship, starting in 1883 with games played between England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. France joined in 1910 and Italy in 2000. In 1996 the Southern Hemisphere teams of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand started their own annual international competition known as the Tri Nations; it adopted its current name of The Rugby Championship when Argentina joined in 2012.\n\nRugby union was previously a medal sport at four Olympic games, in Paris (1900 and 1924), London (1908) and Antwerp (1920), and returned to the Olympics in 2016 in the sevens form. Rugby union sevens is a core event at both the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games.\n\nThe major annual international competition in rugby league is the Four Nations, first played in 1999. It originally involved Britain, Australia and New Zealand before expanding to include a fourth invited nation in 2009. Rugby league introduced its World Cup in 1954 and it has been held intermittently since, in various formats. Rugby union's first World Cup was held in 1987 and both are contested every four years.\n\n"}

{"id": "1510283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1510283", "title": "Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)", "text": "Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)\n\nVirgil Riley Runnels Jr. (October 11, 1945 – June 11, 2015), better known as \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes, was an American professional wrestler, booker, and trainer who most notably worked for the National Wrestling Alliance, Jim Crockett Promotions, and the World Wrestling Federation, later known as the WWE. Following his retirement from wrestling, he made occasional on-air appearances on WWE television and pay-per-views and worked as a backstage booker and producer in WWE's NXT developmental territory. Billed as \"the son of a plumber\", Rhodes did not have a typical wrestler's physique; his character was that of the \"Common Man\", known for the personality exhibited in his interviews. WWE chairman Vince McMahon remarked that no wrestler \"personified the essence of charisma quite like Dusty Rhodes\".\n\nRhodes was a three-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, and during his time in Jim Crockett Promotions, later known as WCW, he was a United States Heavyweight Champion, and multi-time World Television, World Tag Team and World Six-Man Tag Team Champion. He also won many regional championships, and is one of six men inducted into each of the WWE, WCW, Professional Wrestling, and \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" Halls of Fame. His sons, Dustin and Cody, both pursued careers in professional wrestling and performed for WWE.\n\nAfter graduating from Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth, Rhodes played baseball and football for West Texas State (now known as West Texas A&M University). Turning professional, Rhodes tried out for the American Football League's Boston Patriots but was cut. He then played for the Hartford Charter Oaks in the Continental Football League until the team folded.\n\nIn 1967, Rhodes saw an advertisement in the newspaper for Tony Santos’ professional wrestling promotion Big Time Wrestling, based in Boston. Rhodes drove to Boston, and despite not having any wrestling experience, bluffed his way into working for the company by using his real life friendships with Bobby Duncum and the Funk brothers. Billed as Dusty Runnels, one of his first matches was for the BTW World Heavyweight title against champion Frank Scarpa in the Boston Arena. Having little money, Rhodes slept in his car and spent Thanksgiving with Rufus R. Jones in a Boston soup kitchen.\n\nRhodes moved on to Fritz Von Erich's Texas territory World Class Championship Wrestling in 1968, at that time also called Big Time Wrestling. It was in Texas where Rhodes first adopted the ring name \"Dusty Rhodes\". Upon meeting Rhodes, Gary Hart suggested that he change his ring name to \"Lonesome Rhodes\", a character Andy Griffith portrayed in the film \"A Face in the Crowd\". Rhodes reportedly replied: \"Well...I don’t plan on being 'Lonesome'. I think I’ll stick with Dusty.\" Hart took an immediate liking to Rhodes and convinced Von Erich of the young wrestler's potential. Rhodes became a rule-breaking heel with Hart as his manager, teaming with Don Jardine, better known as The Spoiler.\n\nLater in 1968, Rhodes left Texas and entered the Kansas City territory, tagging with fellow Texan Dick Murdoch to form the tag team The Texas Outlaws. The team traveled both nationally and internationally, appearing in Big Time Wrestling (Texas), NWA Western States Sports (Texas), NWA Detroit, National Wrestling Federation (NWF), Championship Wrestling from Florida, World Championship Wrestling (Australia), Tri-State Wrestling, the American Wrestling Association (AWA), and International Wrestling Enterprise (Japan).\n\n Rhodes did not have a typical wrestlers' physique, but he was well known for his personality, charisma and interviews. In 1974, Rhodes's character became a hero after tag team partner Pak Song and manager Gary Hart turned on him during a match in Florida against Eddie and Mike Graham. This led him to break out as a solo wrestler, primarily in Florida, referring to himself as the \"American Dream\", a working class hero, and aligning himself with Eddie Graham.\n\nIn 1977, Rhodes wrestled for Vince McMahon, Sr.'s World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) on and off for lengthy periods of time until 1981. During that time, Rhodes main-evented twice in Madison Square Garden, both times challenging for the WWWF Heavyweight Championship against reigning champion Superstar Billy Graham. Rhodes won the first match on September 26 via countout, and lost the second, a Texas Death match, on October 24. Graham won after a mid-ring collision, falling on Rhodes for the three count.\n\nHe eventually began working as a booker and wrestler with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in the Mid-Atlantic, which eventually purchased World Championship Wrestling (WCW), formerly Georgia Championship Wrestling. Rhodes also teamed with Magnum T.A. as \"America's Team\", who opposed the Four Horsemen and The Russian Team in 1985. They were one of the more dominant tag teams in the promotion until 1986, when Magnum's career was ended in a car accident. Subsequently, he teamed with Nikita Koloff as The Super Powers. Rhodes was also a two time World Six-Man Tag Team Champion with The Road Warriors.\n\nRhodes had feuds with Abdullah the Butcher, Pak Song, Terry Funk, Kevin Sullivan, Blackjack Mulligan, Nikita Koloff, Harley Race, Superstar Billy Graham, \"Crippler\" Ray Stevens and, most notably, The Four Horsemen (especially Ric Flair and Tully Blanchard). Rhodes, Flair and Race fought each other many times over the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Rhodes won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship three times; twice by defeating Race and once by defeating Flair. In October 1985, during his feud with Flair, Rhodes gave an interview that became known as his \"Hard Times\" promo, arguably his most popular promo: \n\nThe promo—which references out-of-work steel workers, factory runners and other blue-collar individuals—apparently resonated with wrestling fans so much that people came to him in arenas in tears to thank him for \"honoring their plight\". In 2015, an ESPN article referred to \"Hard Times\" as Rhodes' best interview, writing, \"In just over three minutes, Rhodes fully encapsulated every ounce of his charm by endearing himself to blue-collar mid-America\".\n\nDuring his stint as booker, JCP were engulfed in aggressive competition with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). When the WWF introduced Mike Jones as Ted DiBiase's bodyguard, Bobby Heenan suggested to name the character \"Virgil\" as an inside joke on Dusty's real name. Also in the late 1980s, Rhodes became synonymous with what would become known as the \"Dusty finish\", a trick ending where a wrestler would win a match while the referee was knocked out, and the decision would be overturned.\n\nRhodes is often considered to be one of the most innovative and creative bookers in the history of professional wrestling. As previously mentioned, his work in the development of \"supercards\" and gimmick matches did much to enhance the quality of entertainment and move the industry forward, as evident by other major promotions following with their own major cards and gimmicks. At the same time, however, he and JCP had an \"old school\" philosophy that did not bode well with the changes that were brought with fast moving media such as cable TV, etc. The long-standing storylines and the frequent use of the aforementioned \"Dusty finish\", techniques that had worked well during the NWA's territorial days, had now started to leave many fans dissatisfied with the promotion's booking.\n\nRhodes was fired after Starrcade '88, because of a taboo on-screen bloodletting (laid down by the Turner Broadcasting System following their purchase of the company) during a November 26 altercation with The Road Warriors. Furious with the interference, Rhodes booked a storyline where Road Warrior Animal pulled a spike out of his shoulder pad and jammed it in Rhodes' eye, causing a severe laceration. Rhodes was then fired from WCW. Following this, Rhodes returned to Florida to compete in Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), where he captured the PWF Heavyweight Championship and also returned to the AWA for a few appearances.\n\nIn mid-1989, Rhodes came to the WWF as the yellow polka-dotted \"Common Man\" Dusty Rhodes, a gimmick some felt was intended to humiliate him due to his synonymy with the rival JCP/WCW. Rhodes was introduced to WWF audiences through a series of vignettes where he would gregariously and enthusiastically perform working class roles (including that of a plumber, butcher's apprentice, gas station attendant, and pizza delivery man), eventually being recognized by others at the end of the skit (\"Hey! Aren't you...?\"). He was managed by Sapphire, who was intended to represent the \"common woman\". During his early time in the WWF, Rhodes was embroiled in a heated storyline with \"Macho King\" Randy Savage and his manager/partner Sensational Queen Sherri, who in turn found a rival in Sapphire. After a confrontation between the two couples, Savage's ex-manager Miss Elizabeth allied herself with Rhodes and Sapphire and was instrumental in helping them win the WWF's first mixed tag-team match during WrestleMania VI. Sapphire, however, left Rhodes during SummerSlam for The Million Dollar Man's money. Afterwards, Rhodes dropped the polka dots and feuded with Dibiase and Virgil, which also resulted in the national debut of his son Dustin at the 1991 Royal Rumble. Both departed the WWF shortly after, marking the end of Rhodes' career as a full-time in-ring competitor.\n\nRhodes returned to WCW in 1991 as a member of WCW's booking committee, making his first appearance only 11 days after his last WWF appearance at the Royal Rumble. Booking disagreements between Rhodes and Ric Flair led to the latter's return to the WWF and the Big Gold Belt controversy. Rhodes also served as the on-screen manager of Ron Simmons from 1991 to 1992 and was in Simmons' corner on August 2, 1992 when he defeated Big Van Vader to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. He later joined the broadcast team, usually working with Tony Schiavone on \"Saturday Night\". He was paired with Schiavone and Bobby Heenan on pay-per-views.\n\nRhodes was originally on the side of WCW when its battle with the New World Order (nWo) began in 1996. At Souled Out 1998, Larry Zbyszko asked Rhodes, who was working the PPV broadcast, to accompany him to the ring for his match against Scott Hall. Zbyszko won the match by disqualification due to interference by Louie Spicolli. Rhodes entered the ring, delivering his trademark elbow smashes to Spicolli as Zbyszko stood and grabbed Hall. Rhodes went to elbow Hall, but seemingly inadvertently hit Zbyszko instead turning heel in the process. Hall then pointed to Rhodes as he revealed an nWo shirt. The three began to drop repeated elbows on Zbyszko before Rhodes announced \"That's tradition, WCW! Bite this!\". Announcer Tony Schiavone left the broadcast booth in shock, but later returned ripping Rhodes for his actions for most of the rest of the night. As a member of the nWo, Rhodes served as the manager of Hall and Nash. This lasted until the November 30, 1998 episode of Monday Nitro, when Rhodes, who was guest refereeing a match between Barry Windham and Dean Malenko after being appointed by Eric Bischoff, defected back to WCW by disqualifying Windham and awarding the match to Malenko. Bischoff then fired Rhodes.\n\nHe left WCW in 2000 and went to Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) where he put over former ECW World Champion, \"King of Old School\" Steve Corino. Rhodes returned once more to WCW, re-igniting his feud with Ric Flair.\n\nAfter both WCW and ECW were bought by WWE (WWF), Rhodes went to compete in his own promotion, Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling with ex-WCW and ECW superstars in the Georgia, Florida and Tennessee.\n\nDuring this time he feuded with Terry Funk and Steve Corino in other territories.\n\nIn 2002, Rhodes competed in Pro Pain Pro Wreslting based in Philadelphia feuding with Kevin Sullivan. This would lead to a Texas Bullrope match on November 23 in which Rhodes defeated Sullivan.\n\nRhodes began appearing with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in 2003, returning to the ring to feud against the villainous Sports Entertainment Xtreme faction. on the January 15 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes, Road Warriors and Jeff Jarrett lost to Vince Russo and Triple X. on the January 22 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes called out Nikita Koloff to reform the Superpowers, but Nikita turns on him. On the February 26 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and Vader defeated Don and Ron Harris by disqualification. On the March 19 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes, Jeff Jarrett and D-Lo Brown defeated Erik Watts, Brian Lawler and David Flair in a six-man tag team match a week later Rhodes defeated David Flair in a Bunkhouse match. On the April 9 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes defeated Brian Lawler in a Ladder match. On the August 13 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and America's Most Wanted defeated Glenn Gilbertti and Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger the following week Rhodes lost a bullrope to Glen Gilbertti after Christopher Daniels interfered. On the October 1 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and Jarrett defeated A.J. Styles and Russo. The following week Rhodes got a shot at the NWA title against Styles but lost when he passed out during the figure-4. On the October 15 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and America's Most Wanted defeated Legend, Sonny Siaki and Ekmo Fatu. On the November 26 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes and Jarrett wrestled to a no contest in a Lumberjack Fan Strap match. After taking a few months off Rhodes returned on May 19, 2004 where he and James Storm defeated Dallas and Kid Kash in a “Bunkhouse Brawl” this led to the duo getting a shot at the NWA World Tag Team Championship on June 2 but they failed to win the titles. On the June 4 episode of Impact, Rhodes gave an interview with Mike Tenay but got punked out by NWA champ Jeff Jarrett. On the July 14 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes, Larry Zbyszko and 3Live Kru defeated Jarrett, Ken Shamrock, Hernandez, Chad Collyer and Onyx. On the August 25 NWATNA PPV, Russo suspended Rhodes from TNA and banned him from the Asylum a few days later on the August 27 episode of Impact, Rhodes showed up in the front row, and got attacked by Scott D’Amore and ejected again. On the September 1 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes under a mask billed as Midnight Rider teamed with Konnan and B.G. James to defeat Team Canada (Eric Young and Bobby Roode and Johnny Devine). On the September 8 NWATNA PPV, Rhodes defeated Scott D'Amore with Russo as the special guest referee. On the October 29 episode of Impact, Rhodes started his campaign to replace Vince Russo as the Director of Authority. Later, he became the Director of Authority at their November 7, 2004 pay-per-view, Victory Road. At the same time, Rhodes acted as head booker and writer. On the April 8, 2005 episode of Impact, Rhodes made the on-air decision to make all matches at Lockdown PPV in Six Sides of Steel. Then on the April 29 episode of Impact, Rhodes announced that MMA fighter Tito Ortiz will referee the World title match at Hard Justice (2005). In May 2005, TNA President Dixie Carter asked Rhodes to move onto a creative team, which included Jeremy Borash, Bill Banks, and Scott D'Amore. Rhodes resigned as booker, waiting out the rest of his contract with TNA, which expired soon after.\n\nRhodes made his first indy circuit appearance on April 12, 2003 for Ring of Honor (ROH), when he participated in the \"I Quit Bunkhouse Riot\" as a member of Homicide's team. On December 12, Rhodes defeated Jerry Lawler at an International Wrestling Cartel show that also featured Mick Foley as the special guest referee. Rhodes returned to ROH on March 13, 2004, where he competed alongside The Carnage Crew in a Scramble Cage match against Special K, which the Carnage Crew won.\n\nOn July 24, Rhodes returned to Full Impact Pro (FIP) and defeated Gangrel. In October, he appeared for Northeast Wrestling in a victory over Kamala. Later in the month, he appeared for IWA Mid-South in a tag team match with Ian Rotten in a victory over Chris Candido and Steve Stone. Rhodes made three appearances for the Japanese promotion HUSTLE in 2004, the first being on January 4 in a six-man tag team match with Steve Corino and Tom Howard against Mil Mascaras, Dos Caras, and Sicodelico Jr., which Rhodes' team lost. The second was on March 7, where he teamed with his son Dustin against Shinjiro Otani and Satoshi Kojima, which he also lost. The third was on May 8, where he defeated Corino.\n\nStarting in December 2004, Rhodes made regular appearances for Carolina Championship Wrestling (CCW), where his first match for the promotion saw him team up with The Rock 'n' Roll Express to take on Dennis Condrey, Bobby Eaton, and Stan Lane, all three of the best-known members of the Midnight Express. He also briefly resurrected his feud with Tully Blanchard in CCW, earning two consecutive victories over him, the second being in a Bunkhouse Brawl. On April 9, 2005, Rhodes challenged Jeff Jarrett (who was still contracted to TNA, but due to TNA's then-affiliation with the NWA, he was allowed to appear for other affiliated promotions) for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In a match that featured Jimmy Valiant as the special guest referee, Jarrett retained the title after Terry Funk made a surprise appearance and interfered. This led to Rhodes challenging Funk to a Falls-Count-Anywhere Bunkhouse match, which Rhodes won. This would be Rhodes' final appearance with CCW until August, where he would team with his son Dustin against Phi Delta Slam.\n\nOn July 15, 2005, Rhodes participated in Ballpark Brawl IV in a victory over Kid Kash. Rhodes participated in the first WrestleReunion, competing in an eight-man tag team match with D'Lo Brown, The Blue Meanie, and Tom Prichard against Steve Corino, Andrew Martin, Evil Clown, and the Masked Superstar. Rhodes faced Tully Blanchard at a \"Starrcade\" Tribute Show on November 19, where he was managed by Magnum T.A. and where Blanchard was managed by James J. Dillon. Rhodes ended up losing the match.\n\nOn December 3, 2005, Rhodes returned to Carolina Championship Wrestling for one night only to face Terry Funk in an \"I Quit\" match, which Rhodes won. Rhodes made his final major appearances on the independent circuit before returning full-time to WWE in mid-2006, defeating Jerry Lawler by disqualification at a Southern Championship Wrestling (SCW) show and also earning a victory over Steve Corino in a Texas Bullrope match for Big Time Wrestling.\n\nIn September 2005, Rhodes signed a WWE Legends deal and was brought onto the Creative Team as a creative consultant. He made an appearance on the October 3, 2005 \"WWE Raw Homecoming\" in which he, along with other legends, beat down Rob Conway, to whom Rhodes delivered a signature \"Bionic Elbow\".\n\nRhodes made an appearance on the June 19, 2006 episode of \"Raw\", appearing in a backstage segment with Vince McMahon where he promoted his new DVD, \"The American Dream – The Dusty Rhodes Story\". A few weeks before Survivor Series, Rhodes returned to WWE to be a part of Team WWE Legends, led by Flair. The team, which consisted of Sgt. Slaughter, Ron Simmons, and Arn Anderson (acting as manager) competed against The Spirit Squad at Survivor Series.\n\nRhodes was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on March 31, 2007 by his two sons, Dustin and Cody. During his acceptance speech, Rhodes asked Ric Flair and Arn Anderson to hold up the \"sign\" and induct him and Harley Race into the Four Horsemen. He has also inducted several other people into the Hall of Fame, including his mentor Eddie Graham in 2008, The Funk Brothers (Terry and Dory Funk Jr.) in 2009, The Road Warriors in 2011, and longtime rivals The Four Horsemen in 2012.\n\nA few weeks before WWE's 2007 broadcast of The Great American Bash, Rhodes returned to WWE television to feud with Randy Orton. At The Great American Bash, Orton defeated Rhodes in a Texas Bullrope match after hitting Rhodes with a cowbell. The following night on \"Raw\", after Orton defeated Rhodes' son Cody, Orton delivered a kick to Rhodes' head while he was trying to tend to his son. On December 10, 2007, on the \"Raw\" 15th Anniversary special episode, Rhodes was at ringside to see Cody and Hardcore Holly defeat Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Championship. On August 31, 2009, during the time Cody was part of The Legacy with Randy Orton and Ted DiBiase, Rhodes was the special guest host of \"Raw\" and booked a match between Cody and Orton for Orton's WWE Championship with John Cena as the special guest referee. It quickly turned out to be a ruse with Dusty's intention to allow Legacy to attack Cena, as well as D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) once they came to make the save. Despite the four standing tall together, Orton quickly gave an RKO to Rhodes, and though initially angered, Cody fell in line behind Orton.\n\nOn July 9, 2010, Rhodes wrestled the final match of his career at an FCW live event, where he teamed up with Cody and Goldust to defeat the team of Caylen Croft, Curt Hawkins, & Trent Barreta in a 6-man tag team match.\n\nRhodes was the head writer and creative director for the weekly \"NXT Wrestling\" television broadcast. On September 12, 2013, he was removed as NXT Commissioner. Rhodes made his return to \"Raw\" on September 16, 2013 after accepting a \"business proposition\" from Stephanie McMahon in an attempt for WWE to rehire both his sons Cody and Dustin. After learning that McMahon would only rehire one son of his choosing, Rhodes turned down the offer and was subsequently knocked out by Big Show on the orders of McMahon. Rhodes also appeared at Battleground in the corner of Cody and Goldust as they took on The Shield (Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns with Dean Ambrose at ringside) in a tag team match. The stipulation of the match would be that if the Rhodes Family won, Cody and Goldust got their jobs with the company back, but if they lose Dusty would be fired as an NXT trainer and none of them could appear on WWE programming ever again. The Rhodes brothers won the match, thus reinstating them to the roster and allowing Dusty to retain his position in NXT. During the match, Dusty got into an altercation with Ambrose and performed the \"Bionic Elbow\" on him.\n\nRhodes appeared on the February 16, 2015 episode of \"Raw\", in an effort to reunite Goldust and Stardust, who were engaged in a conflict. Rhodes appeared at Fastlane on February 22, in a backstage segment with Goldust. Rhodes' final appearance on WWE programming would be on March 28, when he appeared on the Hall of Fame: Live From the Red Carpet show.\n\nRunnels was married to Sandra from 1965 to 1975. In 1978 he married Michelle Rubio; the couple were married for 37 years until his death in 2015. He had four children: Dustin, Kristin, Teil and Cody Runnels. He had five grandchildren; Dakota, the daughter of Dustin and his ex-wife, Terri Boatright, Dalton and Dylan, children of Kristin and her husband Don Ditto, and Kellan and Maris, children of Teil and her husband Kevin Gergel. He also had a brother, Larry, and a sister, Connie.\n\nIn his later years, Rhodes developed kidney failure.\n\nOn June 10, 2015, paramedics responded to Rhodes' home in Orlando, Florida, after getting a call reporting that he had fallen. They drove him to a nearby hospital, where he died the next day. Rhodes was cremated after his death, and his ashes were spread in November 2015 by his son Dustin on a ranch that Rhodes loved to visit.\n\nAt the 2015 Money in the Bank pay-per-view event, a ten-bell salute was given in honor of Rhodes, with the entire WWE roster and the McMahon family on the entrance ramp. The next night on \"Raw\", they honored him with a video tribute and a special after Raw on the WWE Network. At the \"NXT\" tapings following his death, he was honored with another ten-bell salute.\n\nIn August 2015, WWE's NXT introduced the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic, a tag team tournament in honor of Rhodes. The tournament has been held annually since, with three editions having taken place as of April 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

The motivation for the creation of EPP was to create a robust and flexible protocol that could provide communication between domain name registries and domain name registrars. These transactions are required whenever a domain name is registered or renewed, thereby also preventing domain hijacking. Prior to its introduction, registries had no uniform approach, and many different proprietary interfaces existed. While its use for domain names was the initial driver, the protocol is designed to be usable for any kind of ordering and fulfilment system.\n\nEPP is based on XML - a structured, text-based format. The underlying network transport is not fixed, although the only currently specified method is over TCP. The protocol has been designed with the flexibility to allow it to use other transports such as BEEP, SMTP, or SOAP.\n\nThe first protocol drafts were published as IETF individual submission Internet-Draft documents by Scott Hollenbeck of Verisign in November 2000:\n\nThe individual submission documents were adopted by the IETF \"Provisioning Registry\" (\"provreg\") working group, which was created after a BoF session was held at IETF-49 in December 2000. Proposed Standard documents (RFCs 3730 - 3734) were published by the RFC Editor in March 2004. Draft Standard documents (RFCs 4930 - 4934) were published in May 2007. In August 2009 IETF granted EPP the status of full standard, STD 69.\n\nThe protocol has been adopted by a number of domain name registries, such as: .ac, .aero, .ag, .ai, .asia, .ar, .at, .au, .be, .biz, .br, .bz, .ca, .cat, .cc, .ch, .cl, .cn, .co, .cr, .cz, .com, .coop, .cx, .cz, .dk, .ee, .es (over HTTPS), .eu, .fi, .fm, .fr, .gr (over HTTPS), .gs, .hn, .ht, .im, .in, .info, .io, .it (over HTTPS), .jobs, .ke, .ki, .kz, .la, .lc, .li, .lt, .lu, .lv, .md, .me, .mk, .mn, .mobi, .ms, .mu, .mx, .na, .name, .net, .nf, .ng, .nl, .no, .nu, .nz (EPP codes referred to as UDAIs), .org, .pe, .pk, .pl (over HTTPS), .pro, .ps, .pt, .ru, .ro, .sc, .se, .sh, .si, .su, .tel, .tl, .tm, .travel, .tv, .tw, .ua, .uk, .us, .vc, .ve and .za as well as ENUM registries such as those operating the +31, +41, +43, +44 and +48 country codes.\n\nEPP authInfo \"codes\" or \"keys\" are also required in the transfer of generic top-level domain names between registrars (.com, .net, .org, .biz, .info).\n\n.com and .net domain names only began requiring the EPP key from fourth quarter 2006.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21852492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21852492", "title": "Frederick A. de Armas", "text": "Frederick A. de Armas\n\nFrederick A. de Armas is a literary scholar, critic and novelist who is currently Andrew W. Mellon Distinguished Service Professor in Humanities at the University of Chicago.\n\nFrederick A. de Armas was born in Havana, Cuba on February 9, 1945. He attended elementary school at La Salle and when his parents moved to France, he went to boarding school at Le Rosey in Switzerland. After his family lost their possessions as a result of the Cuban Revolution, he moved to the United States. De Armas holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1969), and has taught at Louisiana State University (1969–1988), Pennsylvania State University (where he was Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of Spanish and Comparative Literature) (1988–2000) and has been a visiting professor at Duke University (1994). Since 2000 he has been at the University of Chicago where he is Andrew W. Mellon Distinguished Service Professor in the Departments of Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature. He has served as Chair of Romance Languages and Literatures (2006–2009; 2010–2012). In addition he has been Vice President and President of the Cervantes Society of America (2003–2009); and President of AISO Asociacion Internacional Siglo de Oro (2015-2017).\n\nDe Armas' publications focus on early modern Spanish literature and culture, often from a comparative perspective. His interests include the politics of astrology, magic and the Hermetic tradition, ekphrasis, verbal and visual culture, etc. His early books evince an interest in the relationship between mythology and literature, between the classics and Spanish Golden Age works. They include: \"The Invisible Mistress: Aspects of Feminism and Fantasy in the Golden Age\" (1976), which contains some of the earliest discussions of proto-feminism in early modern Spain, and \"The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calderón\" (1986), which is one of the first studies that approach Calderón from a historicist perspective and is also deeply influenced by the writings of the Warburg Institute. For example, he interprets the figure of Circe in one of Calderon's plays as critiquing the policies of Philip IV's minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares. On the other hand, Astraea is in many cases a figure that serves to praise the regime. His interest in Golden Age Theater has led him to publish several book collections: \"The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of \"La vida es sueño\"\" (1993), \"Heavenly Bodies: The Realms of \"La estrella de Sevilla\"\" (1996) and \"A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia\" (1998).\n\nOne of his main interests throughout his career has been the relationship between the verbal and the visual in early modern Spanish literature and Italian art. In recent years, this subject has become central to his research, as evinced by the book, \"Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics\" (Cambridge, 1998). This study focuses on Cervantes’ most famous tragedy, \"La Numancia\", showing how it is engaged in a conversation with classical authors of Greece and Rome, especially through the interpretations of antiquity presented by the artist Raphael. This book was followed by the collections \"Writing for the Eyes in the Spanish Golden Age\" (2004) and \"Ekphrasis in the Age of Cervantes\" (2005). In the introduction to this last collection he establishes a typology of ekphrasis, including definitions for allusive, collectionist, descriptive, dramatic, interpolated, narrative, shaping, and veiled ekphrasis, as well as meta-ekphrasis and ur-ekphrasis. He applies these terms in his book: \"Quixotic Frescoes. Cervantes and Italian Art\" (Toronto, 2006).\n\nAfter his book on Cervantes and Italian art, he co-edited two collections on Spanish Golden Age theater. The first one, on tragedy, is entitled \"Hacia la tragedia: Lecturas para un nuevo milenio\" (Madrid, 2008); and the second one, on a specific writer is called \"Calderón: del manuscrito a la escena\" (2011). At the same time, he continues to work on Cervantes, having published an edited volume, \"Ovid in the Age of Cervantes\" (2010). His latest book, \"Don Quixote among the Saracens: Clashes of Civilizations and Literary Genres\" (2011) has received the American Publishers' Association PROSE Award in Literature, Honorable Mention (2011). The book has a double focus. The first has to do with a clash of civilizations and asks: Why is Don Quixote at peace among the Saracens? The second has to do with Don Quixote as an \"imperial\" vehicle for the assimilation or destruction of literary genres.\n\nStarting around 2008 De Armas became increasingly interested in the cultural and literary productions of the maternal side of his family, publishing essays on Ana Galdós, Domingo A. Galdós and Benito Pérez Galdós. He has also started to publish fiction while continuing to work on the literature and culture of early modern Spain. His novel, \"El abra del Yumuri\", takes place in Cuba during the last three months of 1958, just before the fall of Fulgencio Batista and the triumph of the Cuban Revolution. It focuses on the lives of five women, most of them from the upper bourgeoisie, and how they deal with political and social upheaval, as well as the dangers of a serial killer that preys on women of means. For some critics, the novel combines two very different trends: that of the social novel inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós, and that of magic realism embodied by Alejo Carpentier. \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13815", "title": "Heracles", "text": "Heracles\n\nHeracles ( ; , \"Hēraklês\", Glory/Pride of \"Hēra\", \"Hera\"), born Alcaeus (, \"Alkaios\") () or Alcides (, \"Alkeidēs\") () was a divine hero in Greek mythology, the son of Zeus and Alcmene, foster son of Amphitryon. He was a great-grandson and half-brother (as they are both sired by the god Zeus) of Perseus. He was the greatest of the Greek heroes, a paragon of masculinity, the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be Heracleidae (), and a champion of the Olympian order against chthonic monsters. In Rome and the modern West, he is known as Hercules, with whom the later Roman emperors, in particular Commodus and Maximian, often identified themselves. The Romans adopted the Greek version of his life and works essentially unchanged, but added anecdotal detail of their own, some of it linking the hero with the geography of the Central Mediterranean. Details of his cult were adapted to Rome as well.\n\nMany popular stories were told of his life, the most famous being The Twelve Labours of Heracles; Alexandrian poets of the Hellenistic age drew his mythology into a high poetic and tragic atmosphere. His figure, which initially drew on Near Eastern motifs such as the lion-fight, was widely known.\n\nHeracles was the greatest of Hellenic chthonic heroes, but unlike other Greek heroes, no tomb was identified as his. Heracles was both hero and god, as Pindar says \"heroes theos\"; at the same festival sacrifice was made to him, first as a hero, with a chthonic libation, and then as a god, upon an altar: thus he embodies the closest Greek approach to a \"demi-god\". The core of the story of Heracles has been identified by Walter Burkert as originating in Neolithic hunter culture and traditions of shamanistic crossings into the netherworld.\n\nHeracles' role as a culture hero, whose death could be a subject of mythic telling (see below), was accepted into the Olympian Pantheon during Classical times. This created an awkwardness in the encounter with Odysseus in the episode of \"Odyssey\" XI, called the Nekuia, where Odysseus encounters Heracles in Hades:\n\nAncient critics were aware of the problem of the aside that interrupts the vivid and complete description, in which Heracles recognizes Odysseus and hails him, and modern critics find very good reasons for denying that the verses beginning, in Fagles' translation \"His ghost I mean...\" were part of the original composition: \"once people knew of Heracles' admission to Olympus, they would not tolerate his presence in the underworld\", remarks Friedrich Solmsen, noting that the interpolated verses represent a compromise between conflicting representations of Heracles.\n\nIn Christian circles a Euhemerist reading of the widespread Heracles cult was attributed to a historical figure who had been offered cult status after his death. Thus Eusebius, \"Preparation of the Gospel\" (10.12), reported that Clement could offer historical dates for Hercules as a king in Argos: \"from the reign of Hercules in Argos to the deification of Hercules himself and of Asclepius there are comprised thirty-eight years, according to Apollodorus the chronicler: and from that point to the deification of Castor and Pollux fifty-three years: and somewhere about this time was the capture of Troy.\"\n\nReaders with a literalist bent, following Clement's reasoning, have asserted from this remark that, since Heracles ruled over Tiryns in Argos at the same time that Eurystheus ruled over Mycenae, and since at about this time Linus was Heracles' teacher, one can conclude, based on Jerome's date—in his universal history, his \"Chronicon\"—given to Linus' notoriety in teaching Heracles in 1264 BCE, that Heracles' death and deification occurred 38 years later, in approximately 1226 BCE.\n\nThe ancient Greeks celebrated the festival of the \"Heracleia\", which commemorated the death of Heracles, on the second day of the month of Metageitnion (which would fall in late July or early August). What is believed to be an Egyptian Temple of Heracles in the Bahariya Oasis dates to 21 BCE. A reassessment of Ptolemy's descriptions of the island of Malta attempted to link the site at Ras ir-Raħeb with a temple to Heracles, but the arguments are not conclusive. Several ancient cities were named Heraclea in his honor.\n\nAlthough the Athenians were among the first to worship Heracles as a god, there were Greek cities that refused to recognize the hero's divine status. There are also several polis that merely provided two separate sanctuaries for Heracles, one recognizing him as a god, the other only as a hero. This ambiguity helped create the Heracles cult especially when historians (e.g. Herodotus) and artists encouraged worship such as the painters during the time of the Peisistratos, who often presented Heracles entering Olympus in their works. \n\nSome sources explained that the cult of Heracles persisted because of the hero's ascent to heaven and his suffering, which became the basis for festivals, ritual, rites, and the organization of mysteries. There is the observation, for example, that sufferings (\"pathea\") gave rise to the rituals of grief and mourning, which came before the joy in the mysteries in the sequence of cult rituals. Also, like the case of Apollo, the cult of Hercules has been sustained through the years by absorbing local cult figures such as those who share the same nature. He was also constantly invoked as a patron for men, especially the young ones. For example, he was considered the ideal in warfare so he presided over gymnasiums and the \"ephebes\" or those men undergoing military training.\n\nThere were ancient towns and cities that also adopted Heracles as a patron deity, contributing to the spread of his cult. There was the case of the royal house of Macedonia, which claimed lineal descent from the hero primarily for purposes of divine protection and legitimator of actions.\n\nThe earliest evidence that show the worship of Heracles in popular cult was in 6th century BC (121–122 and 160–165) via an ancient inscription from Phaleron. \n\nExtraordinary strength, courage, ingenuity, and sexual prowess with both males and females were among the characteristics commonly attributed to him. Heracles used his wits on several occasions when his strength did not suffice, such as when laboring for the king Augeas of Elis, wrestling the giant Antaeus, or tricking Atlas into taking the sky back onto his shoulders. Together with Hermes he was the patron and protector of gymnasia and palaestrae. His iconographic attributes are the lion skin and the club. These qualities did not prevent him from being regarded as a playful figure who used games to relax from his labors and played a great deal with children. By conquering dangerous archaic forces he is said to have \"made the world safe for mankind\" and to be its benefactor. Heracles was an extremely passionate and emotional individual, capable of doing both great deeds for his friends (such as wrestling with Thanatos on behalf of Prince Admetus, who had regaled Heracles with his hospitality, or restoring his friend Tyndareus to the throne of Sparta after he was overthrown) and being a terrible enemy who would wreak horrible vengeance on those who crossed him, as Augeas, Neleus and Laomedon all found out to their cost. There was also a coldness to his character, which was demonstrated by Sophocles' depiction of the hero in \"The Trachiniae\". Heracles threatened his marriage with his desire to bring two women under the same roof, one of them was his wife Deianeira. \n\nIn the works of Euripides involving Heracles, an insight was presented regarding his character and this was through his madness. The idea was that his actions were partly driven by forces outside rational human control and that by highlighting the divine causation of his madness, it becomes a device that problematizes Heracles' character and status within the civilized context. This aspect is also highlighted in \"Hercules Furens\" where Seneca linked the hero's madness to an illusion and a consequence of Herakles' refusal to live a simple life offered by Amphitryon. It was indicated that he preferred the extravagant violence of the heroic life and that its ghosts eventually manifested in his madness and that the hallucinatory visions defined Herakles' character. \n\nA major factor in the well-known tragedies surrounding Heracles is the hatred that the goddess Hera, wife of Zeus, had for him. A full account of Heracles must render it clear why Heracles was so tormented by Hera, when there were many illegitimate offspring sired by Zeus. Heracles was the son of the affair Zeus had with the mortal woman Alcmene. Zeus made love to her after disguising himself as her husband, Amphitryon, home early from war (Amphitryon did return later the same night, and Alcmene became pregnant with his son at the same time, a case of heteropaternal superfecundation, where a woman carries twins sired by different fathers). Thus, Heracles' very existence proved at least one of Zeus' many illicit affairs, and Hera often conspired against Zeus' mortal offspring as revenge for her husband's infidelities. His twin mortal brother, son of Amphitryon, was Iphicles, father of Heracles' charioteer Iolaus.\n\nOn the night the twins Heracles and Iphicles were to be born, Hera, knowing of her husband Zeus' adultery, persuaded Zeus to swear an oath that the child born that night to a member of the House of Perseus would become High King. Hera did this knowing that while Heracles was to be born a descendant of Perseus, so too was Eurystheus. Once the oath was sworn, Hera hurried to Alcmene's dwelling and slowed the birth of the twins Heracles and Iphicles by forcing Ilithyia, goddess of childbirth, to sit crosslegged with her clothing tied in knots, thereby causing the twins to be trapped in the womb. Meanwhile, Hera caused Eurystheus to be born prematurely, making him High King in place of Heracles. She would have permanently delayed Heracles' birth had she not been fooled by Galanthis, Alcmene's servant, who lied to Ilithyia, saying that Alcmene had already delivered the baby. Upon hearing this, she jumped in surprise, loosing the knots and inadvertently allowing Alcmene to give birth to Heracles and Iphicles.\n\nFear of Hera's revenge led Alcmene to expose the infant Heracles, but he was taken up and brought to Hera by his half-sister Athena, who played an important role as protectress of heroes. Hera did not recognize Heracles and nursed him out of pity. Heracles suckled so strongly that he caused Hera pain, and she pushed him away. Her milk sprayed across the heavens and there formed the Milky Way. But with divine milk, Heracles had acquired supernatural powers. Athena brought the infant back to his mother, and he was subsequently raised by his parents.\n\nThe child was originally given the name Alcides by his parents; it was only later that he became known as Heracles. He was renamed Heracles in an unsuccessful attempt to mollify Hera. He and his twin were just eight months old when Hera sent two giant snakes into the children's chamber. Iphicles cried from fear, but his brother grabbed a snake in each hand and strangled them. He was found by his nurse playing with them on his cot as if they were toys. Astonished, Amphitryon sent for the seer Tiresias, who prophesied an unusual future for the boy, saying he would vanquish numerous monsters.\n\nAfter killing his music tutor Linus with a lyre, he was sent to tend cattle on a mountain by his foster father Amphitryon. Here, according to an allegorical parable, \"The Choice of Heracles\", invented by the sophist Prodicus (c. 400 BCE) and reported in Xenophon's \"Memorabilia\" 2.1.21–34, he was visited by two allegorical figures—Vice and Virtue—who offered him a choice between a pleasant and easy life or a severe but glorious life: he chose the latter. This was part of a pattern of \"ethicizing\" Heracles over the 5th century BCE.\n\nLater in Thebes, Heracles married King Creon's daughter, Megara. In a fit of madness, induced by Hera, Heracles killed his children by Megara. After his madness had been cured with hellebore by Antikyreus, the founder of Antikyra, he realized what he had done and fled to the Oracle of Delphi. Unbeknownst to him, the Oracle was guided by Hera. He was directed to serve King Eurystheus for ten years and perform any task Eurystheus required of him. Eurystheus decided to give Heracles ten labours, but after completing them, Heracles was cheated by Eurystheus when he added two more, resulting in the Twelve Labors of Heracles.\n\nDriven mad by Hera, Heracles slew his own children. To expiate the crime, Heracles was required to carry out ten labours set by his archenemy, Eurystheus, who had become king in Heracles' place. If he succeeded, he would be purified of his sin and, as myth says, he would become a god, and be granted immortality. \n\nDespite the difficulty, Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus in the end did not accept the success the hero had with two of the labours. The cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was going to accept pay for the labour. Neither did he accept the killing of the Lernaean Hydra as Heracles' brother, Iolaus, had helped him burn the stumps of the multiplying heads. \n\nEurystheus set two more tasks, fetching the Golden Apples of Hesperides and capturing Cerberus). In the end, with ease, the hero successfully performed each added task, bringing the total number of labours up to the magic number twelve.\n\nNot all versions and writers give the labours in the same order. The \"Bibliotheca\" (2.5.1–2.5.12) gives the following order:\n\n1. Slay the Nemean Lion.\n\n2. Slay the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra.\n\n3. Capture the Golden Hind of Artemis.\n\n4. Capture the Erymanthian Boar.\n\n5. Clean the Augean stables in a single day.\n\n6. Slay the Stymphalian Birds.\n\n7. Capture the Cretan Bull.\n\n8. Steal the Mares of Diomedes.\n\n9. Obtain the girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons.\n\n10. Obtain the cattle of the monster Geryon.\n\n11. Steal the apples of the Hesperides (he had the help of Atlas to pick them after Hercules had slain Ladon).\n\n12. Capture and bring back Cerberus.\n\nAfter completing these tasks, Heracles joined the Argonauts in a search for the Golden Fleece. He also fell in love with Princess Iole of Oechalia. King Eurytus of Oechalia promised his daughter, Iole, to whoever could beat his sons in an archery contest. Heracles won but Eurytus abandoned his promise. Heracles' advances were spurned by the king and his sons, except for one: Iole's brother Iphitus. Heracles killed the king and his sons—excluding Iphitus—and abducted Iole. Iphitus became Heracles' best friend. However, once again, Hera drove Heracles mad and he threw Iphitus over the city wall to his death. Once again, Heracles purified himself through three years of servitude—this time to Queen Omphale of Lydia.\n\nOmphale was a queen or princess of Lydia. As penalty for a murder, imposed by Xenoclea, the Delphic Oracle, Heracles was to serve as her slave for a year. He was forced to do women's work and to wear women's clothes, while she wore the skin of the Nemean Lion and carried his olive-wood club. After some time, Omphale freed Heracles and married him. Some sources mention a son born to them who is variously named. It was at that time that the cercopes, mischievous wood spirits, stole Heracles' weapons. He punished them by tying them to a stick with their faces pointing downward.\n\nWhile walking through the wilderness, Heracles was set upon by the Dryopes. In Apollonius of Rhodes' \"Argonautica\" it is recalled that Heracles had mercilessly slain their king, Theiodamas, over one of the latter's bulls, and made war upon the Dryopes \"because they gave no heed to justice in their lives\". After the death of their king, the Dryopes gave in and offered him Prince Hylas. He took the youth on as his weapons bearer and beloved. Years later, Heracles and Hylas joined the crew of the \"Argo\". As Argonauts, they only participated in part of the journey. In Mysia, Hylas was kidnapped by the nymphs of a local spring. Heracles, heartbroken, searched for a long time but Hylas had fallen in love with the nymphs and never showed up again. In other versions, he simply drowned. Either way, the \"Argo\" set sail without them.\n\nHesiod's \"Theogony\" and Aeschylus' \"Prometheus Unbound\" both tell that Heracles shot and killed the eagle that tortured Prometheus (which was his punishment by Zeus for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mortals). Heracles freed the Titan from his chains and his torments. Prometheus then made predictions regarding further deeds of Heracles.\n\nOn his way back to Mycenae from Iberia, having obtained the Cattle of Geryon as his tenth labour, Heracles came to Liguria in North-Western Italy where he engaged in battle with two giants, Albion and Bergion or Dercynus, sons of Poseidon. The opponents were strong; Hercules was in a difficult position so he prayed to his father Zeus for help. Under the aegis of Zeus, Heracles won the battle. It was this kneeling position of Heracles when he prayed to his father Zeus that gave the name Engonasin (\"Εγγόνασιν\", derived from \"εν γόνασιν\"), meaning \"on his knees\" or \"the Kneeler\",\nto the constellation known as Heracles' constellation. The story, among others, is described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus.\n\nBefore Homer's Trojan War, Heracles had made an expedition to Troy and sacked it. Previously, Poseidon had sent a sea monster to attack Troy. The story is related in several digressions in the \"Iliad\" (7.451–453, 20.145–148, 21.442–457) and is found in pseudo-Apollodorus' Bibliotheke (2.5.9). This expedition became the theme of the Eastern pediment of the Temple of Aphaea. Laomedon planned on sacrificing his daughter Hesione to Poseidon in the hope of appeasing him. Heracles happened to arrive (along with Telamon and Oicles) and agreed to kill the monster if Laomedon would give him the horses received from Zeus as compensation for Zeus' kidnapping Ganymede. Laomedon agreed. Heracles killed the monster, but Laomedon went back on his word. Accordingly, in a later expedition, Heracles and his followers attacked Troy and sacked it. Then they slew all Laomedon's sons present there save Podarces, who was renamed Priam, who saved his own life by giving Heracles a golden veil Hesione had made. Telamon took Hesione as a war prize and they had a son, Teucer.\n\n\n\nThis is described in Sophocles's \"Trachiniae\" and in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\" Book IX. Having wrestled and defeated Achelous, god of the Acheloos river, Heracles takes Deianira as his wife. Travelling to Tiryns, a centaur, Nessus, offers to help Deianira across a fast flowing river while Heracles swims it. However, Nessus is true to the archetype of the mischievous centaur and tries to steal Deianira away while Heracles is still in the water. Angry, Heracles shoots him with his arrows dipped in the poisonous blood of the Lernaean Hydra. Thinking of revenge, Nessus gives Deianira his blood-soaked tunic before he dies, telling her it will \"excite the love of her husband\".\n\nSeveral years later, rumor tells Deianira that she has a rival for the love of Heracles. Deianira, remembering Nessus' words, gives Heracles the bloodstained shirt. Lichas, the herald, delivers the shirt to Heracles. However, it is still covered in the Hydra's blood from Heracles' arrows, and this poisons him, tearing his skin and exposing his bones. Before he dies, Heracles throws Lichas into the sea, thinking he was the one who poisoned him (according to several versions, Lichas turns to stone, becoming a rock standing in the sea, named for him). Heracles then uproots several trees and builds a funeral pyre on Mount Oeta, which Poeas, father of Philoctetes, lights. As his body burns, only his immortal side is left. Through Zeus' apotheosis, Heracles rises to Olympus as he dies.\n\nNo one but Heracles' friend Philoctetes (Poeas in some versions) would light his funeral pyre (in an alternate version, it is Iolaus who lights the pyre). For this action, Philoctetes or Poeas received Heracles' bow and arrows, which were later needed by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the Trojan War.\n\nPhiloctetes confronted Paris and shot a poisoned arrow at him. The Hydra poison subsequently led to the death of Paris. The Trojan War, however, continued until the Trojan Horse was used to defeat Troy.\n\nAccording to Herodotus, Heracles lived 900 years before Herodotus' own time (c. 1300 BCE).\n\nDuring the course of his life, Heracles married four times.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn episode of his female affairs that stands out was his stay at the palace of Thespius, king of Thespiae, who wished him to kill the Lion of Cithaeron. As a reward, the king offered him the chance to perform sexual intercourse with all fifty of his daughters in one night. Heracles complied and they all became pregnant and all bore sons. This is sometimes referred to as his Thirteenth Labour. Many of the kings of ancient Greece traced their lines to one or another of these, notably the kings of Sparta and Macedon.\n\nYet another episode of his female affairs that stands out was when he carried away the oxen of Geryon, he also visited the country of the Scythians. Once there, while asleep, his horses suddenly disappeared. When he woke and wandered about in search of them, he came into the country of Hylaea. He then found the dracaena of Scythia (sometimes identified as Echidna) in a cave. When he asked whether she knew anything about his horses, she answered, that they were in her own possession, but that she would not give them up, unless he would consent to stay with her for a time. Heracles accepted the request, and became by her the father of Agathyrsus, Gelonus, and Scythes. The last of them became king of the Scythians, according to his father's arrangement, because he was the only one among the three brothers that was able to manage the bow which Heracles had left behind and to use his father's girdle. In some versions, the Scythian echidna's children by him are known as the Dracontidae and were the ancestors of a House of Cadmus.\n\nAs a symbol of masculinity and warriorship, Heracles also had a number of male lovers. Plutarch, in his \"Eroticos,\" maintains that Heracles' male lovers were beyond counting. Of these, the one most closely linked to Heracles is the Theban Iolaus. According to a myth thought to be of ancient origins, Iolaus was Heracles' charioteer and squire. Heracles in the end helped Iolaus find a wife. Plutarch reports that down to his own time, male couples would go to Iolaus's tomb in Thebes to swear an oath of loyalty to the hero and to each other.\n\nOne of Heracles' male lovers, and one represented in ancient as well as modern art, is Hylas. Though it is of more recent vintage (dated to the 3rd century) than that with Iolaus, it had themes of mentoring in the ways of a warrior and help finding a wife in the end. There is nothing in Apollonius's account that suggests that Hylas was a sexual lover as opposed to a companion and servant.\n\nAnother reputed male lover of Heracles is Elacatas, who was honored in Sparta with a sanctuary and yearly games, Elacatea. The myth of their love is an ancient one.\n\nAbdera's eponymous hero, Abderus, was another of Heracles' lovers. He was said to have been entrusted with—and slain by—the carnivorous mares of Thracian Diomedes. Heracles founded the city of Abdera in Thrace in his memory, where he was honored with athletic games.\n\nAnother myth is that of Iphitus.\n\nAnother story is the one of his love for Nireus, who was \"the most beautiful man who came beneath Ilion\" (\"Iliad\", 673). But Ptolemy adds that certain authors made Nireus out to be a son of Heracles.\n\nPausanias makes mention of Sostratus, a youth of Dyme, Achaea, as a lover of Heracles. Sostratus was said to have died young and to have been buried by Heracles outside the city. The tomb was still there in historical times, and the inhabitants of Dyme honored Sostratus as a hero. The youth seems to have also been referred to as Polystratus.\n\nThere is also a series of lovers who are either later inventions or purely literary conceits. Among these are Admetus, who assisted in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, Adonis, Corythus, and Nestor who was said to have been loved for his wisdom. His role as lover was perhaps to explain why he was the only son of Neleus to be spared by the hero.\n\nA scholiast on \"Argonautica\" lists the following male lovers of Heracles: \"Hylas, Philoctetes, Diomus, Perithoas, and Phrix, after whom a city in Libya was named\". Diomus is also mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium as the eponym of the deme Diomeia of the Attic phyle Aegeis: Heracles is said to have fallen in love with Diomus when he was received as guest by Diomus' father Collytus. Perithoas and Phrix are otherwise unknown, and so is the version that suggests a sexual relationship between Heracles and Philoctetes.\n\nAll of Heracles' marriages and almost all of his heterosexual affairs resulted in births of a number of sons and at least four daughters.\nOne of the most prominent is Hyllus, the son of Heracles and Deianeira or Melite. The term \"Heracleidae\", although it could refer to all of Heracles' children and further descendants, is most commonly used to indicate the descendants of Hyllus, in the context of their lasting struggle for return to Peloponnesus, out of where Hyllus and his brothers—the children of Heracles by Deianeira—were thought to have been expelled by Eurystheus.\n\nThe children of Heracles by Megara are collectively well known because of their ill fate, but there is some disagreement among sources as to their number and individual names. Apollodorus lists three, Therimachus, Creontiades and Deicoon; to these Hyginus adds Ophitus and, probably by mistake, Archelaus, who is otherwise known to have belonged to the Heracleidae, but to have lived several generations later. A scholiast on Pindar' s odes provides a list of seven completely different names: Anicetus, Chersibius, Mecistophonus, Menebrontes, Patrocles, Polydorus, Toxocleitus.\n\nOther well-known children of Heracles include Telephus, king of Mysia (by Auge), and Tlepolemus, one of the Greek commanders in the Trojan War (by Astyoche).\n\nAccording to Herodotus, a line of 22 Kings of Lydia descended from Hercules and Omphale. The line was called Tylonids after his Lydian name.\n\nThe divine sons of Heracles and Hebe are Alexiares and Anicetus.\n\nIn Rome, Heracles was honored as \"Hercules\", and had a number of distinctively Roman myths and practices associated with him under that name.\n\nHerodotus connected Heracles to the Egyptian god Shu. Also he was associated with Khonsu, another Egyptian god who was in some ways similar to Shu. As Khonsu, Heracles was worshipped at the now sunken city of Heracleion, where a large temple was constructed.\n\nMost often the Egyptians identified Heracles with Heryshaf, transcribed in Greek as \"Arsaphes\" or \"Harsaphes\" (Ἁρσαφής). He was an ancient ram-god whose cult was centered in Herakleopolis Magna.\n\nVia the Greco-Buddhist culture, Heraclean symbolism was transmitted to the Far East. An example remains to this day in the Nio guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples.\n\nHerodotus also connected Heracles to Phoenician god Melqart.\n\nSallust mentions in his work on the Jugurthine War that the Africans believe Heracles to have died in Spain where, his multicultural army being left without a leader, the Medes, Persians, and Armenians who were once under his command split off and populated the Mediterranean coast of Africa.\n\nTemples dedicated to Heracles abounded all along the Mediterranean coastal countries. For example, the temple of \"Heracles Monoikos\" (i.e. the lone dweller), built far from any nearby town upon a promontory in what is now the Côte d'Azur, gave its name to the area's more recent name, Monaco.\n\nThe gateway to the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean, where the southernmost tip of Spain and the northernmost of Morocco face each other is, classically speaking, referred to as the Pillars of Hercules/Heracles, owing to the story that he set up two massive spires of stone to stabilise the area and ensure the safety of ships sailing between the two landmasses.\n\nIn various languages, variants of Hercules' name are used as a male given name, such as Hercule in French, Hércules in Spanish, Iraklis () in Modern Greek and Irakli () in Georgian.\n\nThere are many teams around the world that have this name or have Heracles as their symbol. The most popular in Greece is G.S. Iraklis Thessaloniki.\n\n\"Heracleum\" is a genus of flowering plants in the carrot family Apiaceae. Some of the species in this genus are quite large. In particular, the giant hogweed (\"Heracleum mantegazzianum\") is exceptionally large, growing up to 5 m tall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "72187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72187", "title": "J. M. W. Turner", "text": "J. M. W. Turner\n\nJoseph Mallord William Turner (23 April 177519 December 1851), known as J. M. W. Turner and contemporarily as William Turner, was an English Romantic painter, printmaker and watercolourist. He is known for his expressive colourisations, imaginative landscapes and turbulent, often violent marine paintings.\n\nTurner was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, London, to a modest lower middle-class family. He lived in London all his life, retaining his Cockney accent and assiduously avoiding the trappings of success and fame. A child prodigy, Turner studied at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1789, enrolling when he was 14, and exhibited his first work there at 21. During this period, he also served as an architectural draftsman. He earned a steady income from commissions and sales, which due to his troubled, contrary nature, were often begrudgingly accepted. He opened his own gallery in 1804 and became professor of perspective at the Academy in 1807, where he lectured until 1828, although he was viewed as profoundly inarticulate. He traveled to Europe from 1802, typically returning with voluminous sketchbooks.\n\nIntensely private, eccentric and reclusive, Turner was a controversial figure throughout his career. He did not marry, but fathered two daughters, Eveline (1801–1874) and Georgiana (1811–1843), by his housekeeper Sarah Danby. He became more pessimistic and morose as he got older, especially after the death of his father, after which his outlook deteriorated, and his gallery fell into disrepair and neglect, and his art intensified. He lived in near poverty circumstances and in poor health from 1845, and died in London in 1851 aged seventy-six. Turner is buried in Saint Paul's Cathedral, London.\n\nHe left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 paper works. He had been championed by the leading English art critic John Ruskin from 1840, and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.\n\nJoseph Mallord William Turner was born on 23 April 1775 and baptised on 14 May. He was born in Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, in London, England. His father, William Turner (1745–21 September 1829), was a barber and wig maker. His mother, Mary Marshall, came from a family of butchers. A younger sister, Mary Ann, was born in September 1778 but died in August 1783.\n\nTurner's mother showed signs of mental disturbance from 1785 and was admitted to St Luke's Hospital for Lunatics in Old Street in 1799 and was moved in 1800 to Bethlem Hospital where she died in 1804. Turner was sent to his maternal uncle, Joseph Mallord William Marshall, in Brentford, then a small town on the banks of the River Thames west of London. The earliest known artistic exercise by Turner is from this period—a series of simple colourings of engraved plates from Henry Boswell's \"Picturesque View of the Antiquities of England and Wales\".\nAround 1786, Turner was sent to Margate on the north-east Kent coast. There he produced a series of drawings of the town and surrounding area that foreshadowed his later work. By this time, Turner's drawings were being exhibited in his father's shop window and sold for a few shillings. His father boasted to the artist Thomas Stothard that: \"My son, sir, is going to be a painter\". In 1789, Turner again stayed with his uncle who had retired to Sunningwell in Berkshire (now part of Oxfordshire). A whole sketchbook of work from this time in Berkshire survives as well as a watercolour of Oxford. The use of pencil sketches on location, as the foundation for later finished paintings, formed the basis of Turner's essential working style for his whole career.\n\nMany early sketches by Turner were architectural studies or exercises in perspective, and it is known that, as a young man, he worked for several architects including Thomas Hardwick, James Wyatt and Joseph Bonomi the Elder. By the end of 1789, he had also begun to study under the topographical draughtsman Thomas Malton, specialised in London views. Turner learned from him the basic tricks of the trade, copying and colouring outline prints of British castles and abbeys. He would later call Malton \"My real master\". Topography was a thriving industry by which a young artist could pay for his studies.\n\nTurner entered the Royal Academy of Art in 1789, aged 14, and was accepted into the academy a year later by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Turner showed an early interest in architecture, but was advised by Thomas Hardwick to focus on painting. His first watercolour, \"A View of the Archbishop's Palace, Lambeth\" was accepted for the Royal Academy summer exhibition of 1790 when Turner was 15.\n\nAs an academy probationer, Turner was taught drawing from plaster casts of antique sculptures. From July 1790 to October 1793, his name appears in the registry of the academy over a hundred times. In June 1792, he was admitted to the life class to learn to draw the human body from nude models. Turner exhibited watercolours each year at the academy while painting in the winter and travelling in the summer widely throughout Britain, particularly to Wales, where he produced a wide range of sketches for working up into studies and watercolours. These particularly focused on architectural work, which used his skills as a draughtsman. In 1793, he showed the watercolour titled \"The Rising Squall – Hot Wells from St Vincent's Rock Bristol\" (now lost), which foreshadowed his later climatic effects. Cunningham in his obituary of Turner wrote that it was: \"recognised by the wiser few as a noble attempt at lifting landscape art out of the tame insipidities...[and] evinced for the first time that mastery of effect for which he is now justly celebrated\".\nIn 1796, Turner exhibited \"Fishermen at Sea\", his first oil painting for the academy, of a nocturnal moonlit scene of the Needles off the Isle of Wight, an image of boats in peril. Wilton said that the image: \"Is a summary of all that had been said about the sea by the artists of the 18th century\". and shows strong influence by artists such as Claude Joseph Vernet, Philip James de Loutherbourg, Peter Monamy and Francis Swaine, who was admired for his moonlight marine paintings. This particular painting cannot be said to show any influence of Willem van de Velde the Younger, as not a single nocturnal scene is known by that painter. Some later work, however, was created to rival or complement the manner of the Dutch artist. The image was praised by contemporary critics and founded Turner's reputation, as both an oil painter and a painter of maritime scenes.\n\nTurner travelled widely in Europe, starting with France and Switzerland in 1802 and studying in the Louvre in Paris in the same year. He made many visits to Venice. Important support for his work came from Walter Ramsden Fawkes of Farnley Hall, near Otley in Yorkshire, who became a close friend of the artist. Turner first visited Otley in 1797, aged 22, when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area. He was so attracted to Otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career. The stormy backdrop of \"\" is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over the Chevin in Otley while he was staying at Farnley Hall.\n\nTurner was a frequent guest of George O'Brien Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, at Petworth House in West Sussex and painted scenes that Egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the Sussex countryside, including a view of the Chichester Canal. Petworth House still displays a number of paintings.\n\nAs Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant. His father's death in 1829 had a profound effect on him, and thereafter he was subject to bouts of depression. He never married but had a relationship with an older widow, Sarah Danby. He is believed to have been the father of her two daughters born in 1801 and 1811.\n\nTurner formed a relationship with Sophia Caroline Booth after her second husband died, and he lived for about 18 years as \"Mr Booth\" in her house in Chelsea.\n\nTurner was a habitual user of snuff; in 1838, Louis Philippe I, King of the French presented a gold snuff box to him. Of two other snuffboxes, an agate and silver example bears Turner's name, and another, made of wood, was collected along with his spectacles, magnifying glass and card case by an associate housekeeper.\n\nTurner died of cholera at the home of Sophia Caroline Booth, in Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, on 19 December 1851. He is buried in St Paul's Cathedral, where he lies near to Sir Joshua Reynolds. Apparently his last words were \"The Sun is God\", though this may be apocryphal.\n\nTurner's friend, the architect Philip Hardwick (1792–1870), son of his tutor, Thomas Hardwick, was in charge of making the funeral arrangements and wrote to those who knew Turner to tell them at the time of his death that, \"I must inform you, we have lost him.\" Other executors were his cousin and chief mourner at the funeral, Henry Harpur IV (benefactor of Westminster – now Chelsea & Westminster – Hospital), Revd. Henry Scott Trimmer, George Jones RA and Charles Turner ARA.\n\nTurner's talent was recognised early in his life. Financial independence allowed Turner to innovate freely; his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint. According to David Piper's \"The Illustrated History of Art\", his later pictures were called \"fantastic puzzles\". Turner was recognised as an artistic genius: the influential English art critic John Ruskin described him as the artist who could most \"stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of Nature\". Turner's work drew criticism from contemporaries, in particular from Sir George Beaumont, a landscape painter and fellow member of the Royal Academy, who described his paintings as 'blots'.\n\nTurner's imagination was sparked by shipwrecks, fires (including the burning of Parliament in 1834, an event which Turner witnessed first-hand, and transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches), and natural phenomena such as sunlight, storm, rain, and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea, as seen in \"Dawn after the Wreck\" (1840) and \"The Slave Ship\" (1840).\n\nTurner's major venture into printmaking was the \"Liber Studiorum\" (Book of Studies), seventy prints that he worked on from 1806 to 1819. The \"Liber Studiorum\" was an expression of his intentions for landscape art. The idea was loosely based on Claude Lorrain's \"Liber Veritatis\" (Book of Truth), where Lorrain had recorded his completed paintings; a series of print copies of these drawings, by then at Devonshire House, had been a huge publishing success. Turner's plates were meant to be widely disseminated, and categorised the genre into six types: Marine, Mountainous, Pastoral, Historical, Architectural, and Elevated or Epic Pastoral. His printmaking was a major part of his output, and a museum is devoted to it, the Turner Museum in Sarasota, Florida, founded in 1974 by Douglass Montrose-Graem to house his collection of Turner prints.\n\nTurner's early works, such as \"\" (1795), stayed true to the traditions of English landscape. However, in \"\" (1812), an emphasis on the destructive power of nature had already come into play. His distinctive style of painting, in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints, created lightness, fluency, and ephemeral atmospheric effects.\n\nIn Turner's later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour. A prime example of his mature style can be seen in \"Rain, Steam and Speed – The Great Western Railway\", where the objects are barely recognisable. The intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed Turner's work in the vanguard of English painting but exerted an influence on art in France; the Impressionists, particularly Claude Monet, carefully studied his techniques.\n\nHigh levels of volcanic ash (from the eruption of Mt. Tambora) in the atmosphere during 1816, the \"Year Without a Summer\", led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, and were an inspiration for some of Turner's work.\n\nJohn Ruskin said that an early patron, Thomas Monro, Principal Physician of Bedlam, and a collector and amateur artist, was a significant influence on Turner's style:\nHis true master was Dr Monro; to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend Girtin, the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed; the greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to over-estimate.\n\nTogether with a number of young artists, Turner was able, in the London house of Dr. Monro, to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing. But the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of the watercolours of John Robert Cozens, some of which were present in Monro's house, went far further than the neat renderings of topography. The solemn grandeur of his Alpine views were an early revelation to the young artist and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium, conveying mood instead of information.\n\nTurner experimented with a wide variety of pigment. He used pigments like carmine, despite knowing that they were not long-lasting, and against the advice of contemporary experts to use more durable pigments. As a result, many of his colours have now faded. John Ruskin complained at how quickly his work decayed; Turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied. By 1930, there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading.\n\nTurner left a small fortune which he hoped would be used to support what he called \"decayed artists\". He planned an almshouse at Twickenham with a gallery for some of his works. His will was contested and in 1856, after a court battle, his first cousins, including Thomas Price Turner, received part of his fortune. Another portion went to the Royal Academy of Arts, which occasionally awards students the Turner Medal. His finished paintings were bequeathed to the British nation, and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them. This did not happen due to disagreement over the final site. Twenty-two years after his death, the British Parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside London, and so began the process of scattering the pictures which Turner had wanted to be kept together.\n\nIn 1910, the main part of the Turner Bequest, which includes unfinished paintings and drawings, was rehoused in the Duveen Turner Wing at the National Gallery of British Art (now Tate Britain). In 1987, a new wing at the Tate, the Clore Gallery, was opened to house the Turner bequest, though some of the most important paintings remain in the National Gallery in contravention of Turner's condition that they be kept and shown together. Increasingly paintings are lent abroad, ignoring Turner's provision that they remain constantly and permanently in Turner's Gallery.\n\nSt. Mary's Church, Battersea added a commemorative stained glass window for Turner, between 1976 and 1982. St Paul's Cathedral, Royal Academy of Arts and Victoria & Albert Museum all hold statues representing him. A portrait by Cornelius Varley with his patent graphic telescope (Sheffield Museums & Galleries) was compared with his death mask (National Portrait Gallery, London) by Kelly Freeman at Dundee University 2009–10 to ascertain whether it really depicts Turner. The city of Westminster unveiled a memorial plaque at the site of his birthplace at 21 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden 2 June 1999.\n\nSelby Whittingham founded The Turner Society at London and Manchester in 1975. After the society endorsed the Tate Gallery's Clore Gallery wing (on the lines of the Duveen wing of 1910), as the solution to the controversy of what should be done with the Turner Bequest, Selby Whittingham resigned and founded the Independent Turner Society. The Tate created the prestigious annual Turner Prize art award in 1984, named in Turner's honour, and 20 years later the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours founded the Winsor & Newton Turner Watercolour Award. A major exhibition, \"Turner's Britain\", with material (including \"The Fighting Temeraire\") on loan from around the globe, was held at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery from 7 November 2003 to 8 February 2004. In 2005, Turner's \"The Fighting Temeraire\" was voted Britain's \"greatest painting\" in a public poll organised by the BBC.\n\nLeo McKern played Turner in \"The Sun is God\", a 1974 Thames Television production directed by Michael Darlow. The programme was shown on 17 December 1974, during the Turner Bicentenary Exhibition in London.\n\nIn January 2011 \"The Painter\", a biographical play on his life by Rebecca Lenkiewicz, premiered at the Arcola Theatre in London.\n\nBritish filmmaker Mike Leigh wrote and directed \"Mr. Turner\", a biopic of Turner's later years, released in 2014. The film starred Timothy Spall as Turner, Dorothy Atkinson, Marion Bailey and Paul Jesson, and premiered in competition for the \"Palme d'Or\" at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, with Spall taking the award for Best Actor.\n\nTurner was an extremely prolific artist who left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 paper works. The Tate Gallery in London produces the most comprehensive and up to date catalogue of Turner works held in both public and private collections worldwide.\n\na. Although Turner was known by his middle name, William, he is now generally referred to by his initials, in order to avoid confusion with another artist named William Turner.\n\nb. Turner claimed to have been born on 23 April 1775, which is both Saint George's Day and the supposed birthday of William Shakespeare, but this claim has never been verified. The first verifiable date is that Turner was baptised on 14 May, and some authors doubt the 23 April date, on the grounds that high infant mortality rates would have meant that parents would usually baptise their children shortly after birth.\n\nc. Mary Marshall died in 1804, after having been committed in 1799 to St Luke's Hospital and then to the Bethlem Royal Hospital, a mental asylum. Her illness possibly due in part to the early death of Turner's younger sister. Hamilton suggests that this \"fit of illness\" may have been an early sign of her madness.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13193636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13193636", "title": "Lithuanian Chronicles", "text": "Lithuanian Chronicles\n\nThe Lithuanian Chronicles (), or Belarusian-Lithuanian Chronicles (; ) are three redactions of chronicles compiled in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. All redactions were written in the Ruthenian language and served the needs of Lithuanian patriotism. The first edition, compiled in the 1420s, glorified Vytautas the Great and supported his side in power struggles. The second redaction, prepared in the first half of the 16th century, started the myth of Lithuanian Roman origin: it gave a fanciful genealogy of Palemon, a noble from the Roman Empire who founded the Grand Duchy. This noble origin of Lithuanians was important in cultural rivalry with the Kingdom of Poland. The third redaction, known as the Bychowiec Chronicle, elaborated even further on the legend, but also provided some useful information about the second half of the 15th century. The three redactions, the first known historical accounts produced within the Grand Duchy, gave rise to the historiography of Lithuania. All medieval historians used these accounts, that survived in over 30 known manuscripts, as basis for their publications and some of the myths created in the chronicles persisted even to the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe first or the short redaction (also known as \"Chronicle of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania\" or \"Letopisec Litovskii\") was compiled sometime in the 1420s in Smolensk, when Vytautas the Great hoped to be crowned as King of Lithuania. This redaction included the earliest known historical account produced in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: \"Dis ist Witoldes sache wedir Jagalan und Skargalan\", a complaint and memorial written by Vytautas in 1390 during the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392). It detailed his power struggles against cousins Jogaila and Skirgaila in 1379–1390 and supported his claims to his patrimony in Trakai and title of Grand Duke of Lithuania. Two translations of this document survive: Latin \"Origo regis Jagyelo et Witholdi ducum Lithuanie\" from the 15th century and Russian \"Litovskomu rodu pochinok\" from the 14th century. Later this document was expanded to include events up to 1396. It formed the backbone of the first chronicle.\n\nThe first redaction survived only from later manuscripts and compilations. The earliest known compilation was prepared in Smolensk around 1446 by bishop Gerasim and his clerk Timofei. The compilation also included a praise to Vytautas, written by Gerasim, a story about Podolia, written in 1431–1435 to support the Lithuanian claims against Poland in the Lithuanian Civil War, a description of power struggles between Švitrigaila and Sigismund Kęstutaitis, a short summary of Moscow's chronicles (854–1428), and latest events in Smolensk (1431–1445). The compilation also did not survive in its original state. It is known from several manuscripts:\n\nThe second, more extensive, redaction (also known as \"Chronicle of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Samogitia\") was compiled in the second half of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century (the final version probably came into existence around the 1520s at the court of Albertas Goštautas). The redaction traced back the foundations of the Lithuanian state to the 1st century, when legendary Palemon escaped from Roman Empire and settled at the mouth of Dubysa. He founded the Palemonids dynasty and became the first ruler of Lithuania. This legendary part was then followed by the revised first redaction, detailing the lineage of the Gediminids. Mindaugas, the first King of Lithuania crowned in 1253, and other earlier historically attested dukes were skipped entirely. The elaborate story that Lithuanians were of noble Roman origins had no historical basis and was discarded by modern historians as nothing more than a myth.\n\nWhile many modern historians discount the text as useless, it can still provide useful bits and pieces of Lithuanian history as it incorporates many garbled fragments of earlier, now lost, documents and chronicles. Also, the mythical Palemon is a good evidence of political tensions and cultural ideology of the Lithuanian nobles in the 16th century. This myth served Lithuanian interests in conflicts with Poland and Russia. Poland, then in personal union with Lithuania, claimed that it brought civilization to this barbaric pagan land. By creating fanciful genealogies, linking Lithuanians with noble Romans, the Lithuanian nobility could counter these claims and demand political independence.\n\nThis redaction rarely included dates and contained several independent stories that were cherished by 19th century nationalists: legends how Gediminas founded Vilnius because of his dreams of Iron Wolf, how Kęstutis took pagan priestess Birutė for his wife, how Vytautas lavishly treated his guests at the Conference of Lutsk in 1429, etc. Among them were some factual stories, including Algirdas' three sieges of Moscow. This format differed significantly from other Slavic chronicles that tended to list inter-related events year-by-year. The second redaction also considerably trimmed and fragmented parts about Ruthenia and Grand Duchy of Moscow; thus the text became primarily about Lithuania. The chronicle was popular and often copied. It shaped the political mentality of the Lithuanian nobility, formed the basis for the Lithuanian historiography until the dawn of the 20th century, and inspired many literary works.\n\nSeveral manuscripts are known:\n\nThe third and most extensive redaction is known as the Bychowiec Chronicle. It is based on the second redaction. It is believed that this redaction was prepared around the same time as the second redaction with support from Albertas Goštautas. The only known version was discovered in a manor owned by Aleksander Bychowiec and was published in full by Teodor Narbutt in 1846. This chronicle was updated to include events up to 1574. Initially there were doubts if the chronicle is authentic and some suggested that Narbutt falsified it. The doubts were inspired by its sudden discovery and its peculiar similarity with the chronicles of Maciej Stryjkowski; also Narbutt is known to have falsified several other documents. However, new evidence came to light that portions of the chronicle were published in 1830. Historians now suggest that similarity with Stryjkowski's works resulted from using the same document, maybe even the original third redaction, as the source. Further, in 2011, Lithuanian historians discovered a fragment (about one-fifth of the original) of the third redaction at the and published it in 2018.\n\nThe patriotic themes were even more prevalent than in the second redaction. It continued to elaborate on the Palemon legend: to improve chronology Palemon was moved to the 5th century Rome, devastated by Attila the Hun, and Mindaugas and other historical dukes were incorporated into the legend. It also concentrated more on the Catholic Church than earlier revisions, which paid closer attention to Eastern Orthodoxy. It is an important source for the late 15th century events, especially years of Alexander Jagiellon.\n\nThe popularity of the \"Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all of Ruthenia\", published by Maciej Stryjkowski in 1582, pushed the old handwritten Lithuanian chronicles into obscurity. They were rediscovered with the advent of professional historiography in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when historians began to critically analyze primary sources to verify various claims. That necessitated the publication of primary sources. The first Lithuanian Chronicle, the Supraśl Manuscript, was published in 1823 by . In 1846, Teodor Narbutt published the Bychowiec Chronicle. Other historians published other manuscripts that they had found. In 1860s, the Archaeographic Commission became interested in collecting and publishing all known manuscripts of the Lithuanian Chronicles. Twelve manuscripts were published in 1907 as volume 17 of the \"Complete Collection of Russian Chronicles\" as West Russian Chronicles (), which became the standard reference. The collection, newly compiled and edited by Mikałaj Ułaščyk, was published as volumes 32 (1975) and 35 (1980) of the \"Complete Collection\". However, despite the discovery of several other manuscripts since 1907, the new volumes did not include them. \n"}

There are many loanwords from different languages, reflecting cultural interaction throughout history. Notable loanwords were borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Turkish, Hungarian, Russian, and German.\n\nIt is estimated that there are 900–1,200 Greek, 88–188 German, and an uncertain high number of Turkish loanwords in modern Serbian.\n\nAncient Greek words in Proto-Slavic are identified through phonetic features, some related to Greek phonetic history, others possibly Scythian-Sarmatian or Gothic mediations. Ancient Greek, non-mediated words are \"korablja\" (ark), \"koliba\" (cottage, hut), and supposedly \"trem\" (porch); Scythian mediations are \"luk\" (onion), \"haluga\" (fence), \"koš\" (basket), \"talog\" (dregs), \"kurva\" (whore); supposedly Gothic mediations are \"crkva\" (church) and \"daska\" (plank). There exists loanwords in Proto-Slavic from non-Indo-European languages. Among Turanian (Ural-Altaic) lexemes, estimated to have been adopted between the 3rd and 7th century, surviving into modern Serbian are \"čaša\" (cup), \"knjiga\" (book), \"kovčeg\" (chest), \"krčag\" (pitcher), \"sablja\" (sabre). Adoptions from Avaric in the 6th–7th centuries are the titles \"ban\" and \"župan\", and \"klobuk\" (a type of hat). South Slavic was also influenced by Bulgar since their arrival in the eastern Balkans in the 7th century, e.g. \"beleg\" (landmark), \"beočug\" (shackle), \"bubreg\" (kidney), \"pašenog\" (co-brother-in-law), \"tojaga\" (bludgeon).\n\nThe South Slavic languages were greatly influenced by Greek beginning in the Early Middle Ages, through translation of Byzantine works, leaving religious, philosophical and psychological terms. Late medieval speech had very few loanwords, rather replacing Greek words with calques for linguistical purity. German linguist Vasmer (1944) recorded 1,000 Greek words in Serbian, most of which were addressed in the Old Serbian form. Today, it is estimated that 900–1,200 Grecisms (\"grecizmi\") exist in Serbian, more than 400 being in the church-religious section. In the economical section, apart from Greek, many words in Old Serbian were Romance. In mining, the majority of words were Germanic, arriving with Saxons.\n\nThe Ottoman conquest began a linguistical contact between Turkish and South Slavic; Turkish influence grew stronger after the 15th century. Besides Turkish loanwords, also many Arabic (such as \"alat\", \"tool\", \"sat\", \"time, clock\") and Persian (\"čarape\", \"socks\", \"šećer\", \"sugar\") words entered via Turkish, called \"Orientalisms\" (\"orijentalizmi\"). Also, many Greek words entered via Turkish. Words for hitherto unknown sciences, businesses, industries, technologies and professions were brought by the Ottoman Empire. Christian villagers brought urban vocabulary from their travels to Islamic culture cities. Many Turkish loanwords are no longer considered loanwords.\n\nEnglish influence is seen in recent times, with the common suffixes \"-er\" and \"-ing\". Examples are \"kasting\", \"ketering\", \"konsalting\", \"listing\", \"džoging\", \"šoping\", etc. Foreign loanwords are becoming more frequent in sports terminology.\n\nThe differences between Serbian and Croatian is mainly reflected in loanwords. Bosnian has the most Turkish loanwords of all Serbo-Croatian variants.\n\nSerbo-Croatian vocabulary is of mixed origin, with words borrowed from Greek, Latin, Italian, Turkish, Hungarian, and more recently Russian, Czech and German. Most loanwords have entered Serbian without resistance, while on the other hand in Croatian, linguistic purism was adopted as a policy during Austria-Hungary (against presumed Germanization) and later in Yugoslavia (against presumed Serbian domination). In Croatia, the term \"Serbisms\" is used for characteristically Serbian words, unwanted during World War II and the Yugoslav wars, many of which have been replaced by neologisms.\n\n\n"}

The stories are frequently referred to as the Martin Beck stories. All of the novels have been adapted to films between 1967 and 1994, six of which featured Gösta Ekman as Martin Beck. Between 1997 and 2018 there have also been 38 films (some only broadcast on television) based on the characters, with Peter Haber as Martin Beck.\n\nSjöwall and Wahlöö, during the 1960s and 1970s, conceived and wrote a series of ten novels (police procedurals) about the exploits of detectives from the special homicide commission of the Swedish national police in which the character of Martin Beck was the protagonist. Both authors also wrote novels separately. For the Martin Beck series, they plotted and researched each book together and then wrote alternate chapters. The books cover ten years and are renowned for extensive character and setting development throughout the series. This is in part due to careful planning by Sjöwall and Wahlöö.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll ten novels have been adapted to film, although some have appeared with different titles and four have been filmed outside Sweden. The first actor to play Martin Beck was Keve Hjelm in 1967. Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt portrayed Beck in 1976. In 1993 and 1994, Gösta Ekman played the character in six films. To the American audiences, the most notable actor to play Martin Beck is Walter Matthau from the 1973 film called \"The Laughing Policeman\", although his character was called \"Jake Martin.\" Martin Beck has also been played by Jan Decleir, Derek Jacobi and Romualds Ancāns. Two of the novels have been adapted for films twice, \"Roseanna\" and \"Murder at the Savoy\". In the later films which are only based on the characters, Martin Beck is played by Peter Haber.\n\n\n\nThe BBC has adapted the series for radio and began broadcasting the adaptions in October 2012 under the umbrella title of \"The Martin Beck Killings\". Beck is played by Steven Mackintosh and Kollberg by Neil Pearson. Other actors include Ralph Ineson as Larsson, Russell Boulter as Rönn, and Adrian Scarborough as Melander.\n\n\nSjöwall and Wahlöö's technique of mixing traditional crime fiction with a focus on the social issues in the Swedish welfare state received a great deal of attention. The concept has been updated in the 1990s with Henning Mankell's detective character Kurt Wallander and in the 2000s with Stieg Larsson's \"Millennium\" trilogy featuring Lisbeth Salander. The basic concept has, by extension, given rise to the entire Scandinavian noir scene.

The mob beat them with sticks and hacked them to death. The dead were identified as Sheikh Jiauddin, Sheikh Mannan, Sudhir Ghosh and Nirmal Ghosh, supporters of the Kanu Sanyal faction of the CPI(ML).\n\nThe district judge of Birbhum, Dipak Saha Ray, awarded life terms to 46 CPI(M) cadres for their involvement in the Muluk murder case on 31 March 2009. The convicted CPI(M) cadres included Akhtar Sheikh, the then CPI(M} upapradhan of Muluk gram panchayat, Roushan Ali, the then CPI(M) panchayat samiti member, Mistri Murmu, the then CPI(M} gram panchayat member and Safiul Rahaman, the then CPI(M) branch committee secretary.

{"id": "70667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70667", "title": "National Archives and Records Administration", "text": "National Archives and Records Administration\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is an independent agency of the United States government charged with preserving and documenting government and historical records and with increasing public access to those documents, which comprise the National Archives. NARA is officially responsible for maintaining and publishing the legally authentic and authoritative copies of acts of Congress, presidential directives, and federal regulations. The NARA also transmits votes of the Electoral College to Congress.\n\nThe Archivist of the United States is the chief official overseeing the operation of the National Archives and Records Administration. The Archivist not only maintains the official documentation of the passage of amendments to the U.S. Constitution by state legislatures, but has the authority to declare when the constitutional threshold for passage has been reached, and therefore when an act has become an amendment.\n\nThe Office of the Federal Register publishes the \"Federal Register\", \"Code of Federal Regulations\", and \"United States Statutes at Large\", among others. It also administers the Electoral College.\n\nThe National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC)—the agency's grant-making arm—awards funds to state and local governments, public and private archives, colleges and universities, and other nonprofit organizations to preserve and publish historical records. Since 1964, the NHPRC has awarded some 4,500 grants.\n\nThe Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) is a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) resource for the public and the government. Congress has charged NARA with reviewing FOIA policies, procedures and compliance of Federal agencies and to recommend changes to FOIA. NARA's mission also includes resolving FOIA disputes between Federal agencies and requesters.\n\nOriginally, each branch and agency of the U.S. government was responsible for maintaining its own documents, which often resulted in the loss and destruction of records. Congress established the National Archives Establishment in 1934 to centralize federal record keeping, with the Archivist of the United States as chief administrator. The National Archives was incorporated with GSA in 1949; in 1985 it became an independent agency as NARA (National Archives and Records Administration).\n\nThe first Archivist, R.D.W. Connor, began serving in 1934, when the National Archives was established by Congress. As a result of a first Hoover Commission recommendation, in 1949 the National Archives was placed within the newly formed General Services Administration (GSA). The Archivist served as a subordinate official to the GSA Administrator until the National Archives and Records Administration became an independent agency on April 1, 1985.\n\nIn March 2006, it was revealed by the Archivist of the United States in a public hearing that a memorandum of understanding between NARA and various government agencies existed to \"reclassify\", i.e., withdraw from public access, certain documents in the name of national security, and to do so in a manner such that researchers would not be likely to discover the process (the U.S. reclassification program). An audit indicated that more than one third withdrawn since 1999 did not contain sensitive information. The program was originally scheduled to end in 2007.\n\nIn 2010, Executive Order 13526 created the National Declassification Center to coordinate declassification practices across agencies, provide secure document services to other agencies, and review records in NARA custody for declassification.\n\nIn 2011, a retired employee pleaded guilty to stealing original sound recordings from the archives.\nArchival Recovery Teams investigate the theft of records.\n\nNARA's holdings are classed into \"record groups\" reflecting the governmental department or agency from which they originated. Records include paper documents, microfilm, still pictures, motion pictures, and electronic media.\n\nArchival descriptions of the permanent holdings of the federal government in the custody of NARA are stored in the National Archives Catalog. The archival descriptions include information on traditional paper holdings, electronic records, and artifacts. As of December 2012, the catalog consisted of about 10 billion logical data records describing 527,000 artifacts and encompassing 81% of NARA's records. There are also 922,000 digital copies of already digitized materials.\n\nMost records at NARA are in the public domain, as works of the federal government are excluded from copyright protection. However, records from other sources may still be protected by copyright or donor agreements. Executive Order 13526 directs originating agencies to declassify documents if possible before shipment to NARA for long-term storage, but NARA also stores some classified documents until they can be declassified. Its Information Security Oversight Office monitors and sets policy for the U.S. government's security classification system.\n\nMany of NARA's most requested records are frequently used for genealogy research. This includes census records from 1790 to 1940, ships' passenger lists, and naturalization records.\n\nThe most well known facility of the National Archives and Records Administration is the National Archives Building (informally known as \"Archives I\"), located north of the National Mall on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C.. A sister facility, known as the National Archives at College Park (or \"Archives II\") was opened 1994 near the University of Maryland. The Washington National Records Center (WNRC), also located in the Washington, D.C., metro area, is a large warehouse type facility which stores federal records that are still under the control of the creating agency. Federal government agencies pay a yearly fee for storage at the facility. In accordance with federal records schedules, documents at WNRC are transferred to the legal custody of the National Archives after a certain point (this usually involves a relocation of the records to College Park). Temporary records at WNRC are either retained for a fee or destroyed after retention times has elapsed. WNRC also offers research services and maintains a small research room.\n\nAcross the United States, the National Archives maintains both research facilities and additional federal records centers. In many cases, the research rooms of regional archives are located at the same site of the federal records center (FRCs) which are not accessible to the public. \n\nIn an effort to make its holdings more widely available and more easily accessible, the National Archives began entering into public–private partnerships in 2006. A joint venture with Google will digitize and offer NARA video online. When announcing the agreement, Archivist Allen Weinstein said that this pilot program is\n… an important step for the National Archives to achieve its goal of becoming an archive without walls. Our new strategic plan emphasizes the importance of providing access to records anytime, anywhere. This is one of many initiatives that we are launching to make our goal a reality. For the first time, the public will be able to view this collection of rare and unusual films on the Internet.\"\n\nOn January 10, 2007, the National Archives and Fold3.com (formerly Footnote) launched a pilot project to digitize historic documents from the National Archives holdings. Allen Weinstein explained that this partnership would \"allow much greater access to approximately 4.5 million pages of important documents that are currently available only in their original format or on microfilm\" and \"would also enhance NARA's efforts to preserve its original records.\"\n\nIn July 2007, the National Archives announced it would make copies of its collection of Universal Newsreels from 1929 to 1967 available for purchase through CreateSpace, an Amazon.com subsidiary. During the announcement, Weinstein noted that the agreement would \"... reap major benefits for the public-at-large and for the National Archives.\" Adding, \"While the public can come to our College Park, MD research room to view films and even copy them at no charge, this new program will make our holdings much more accessible to millions of people who cannot travel to the Washington, DC area.\" The agreement also calls for CreateSpace partnership to provide the National Archives with digital reference and preservation copies of the films as part of NARA's preservation program.\n\nIn May 2008, the National Archives announced a five-year agreement to digitize selected records including the complete U.S. Federal Census Collection, 1790–1930, passenger lists from 1820–1960 and World War I and World War II draft registration cards. The partnership agreement allows for exclusive use of the digitized records by Ancestry.com for a 5-year embargo period at which point the digital records will be turned over to the National Archives.\n\nThe National Archives currently utilizes social media and Web 2.0 technologies in an attempt to communicate better with the public.\n\nOn June 18, 2009, the National Archives announced the launching of a YouTube channel \"to showcase popular archived films, inform the public about upcoming events around the country, and bring National Archives exhibits to the people.\" Also in 2009, the National Archives launched a Flickr photostream to share portions of its photographic holdings with the general public.\nA new teaching with documents website premiered in 2010 and was developed by the education team. The website features 3,000 documents, images, and recordings from the holdings of the Archives. The site also features lesson plans and tools for creating new classroom activities and lessons.\n\nIn 2011, the National Archives initiated a WikiProject on the English Wikipedia to expand collaboration in making its holdings widely available through Wikimedia.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5898442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5898442", "title": "Natural History Museum at Tring", "text": "Natural History Museum at Tring\n\nThe Natural History Museum at Tring was the private museum of Lionel Walter, 2nd Baron Rothschild; today it is under the control of the Natural History Museum, London. It houses one of the finest collections of stuffed mammals, birds, reptiles and insects in the United Kingdom. It was first known as the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum; however, in April 2007 the NHM changed its name. The museum is located on Akeman Street, in Tring, Hertfordshire.\n\nThe Natural History Museum at Tring was once the private museum of Lionel Walter, 2nd Baron Rothschild, and is located in the grounds of the former Rothschild family home of Tring Park. The building was constructed in 1889 to house his collection of mounted specimens and first opened to the public in 1892. The Rothschild family gave the Museum and its contents to the nation in 1937. Lionel Walter bred hybrids between zebras and horses (zebroids) and a hybrid foal is on display. He was frequently seen riding a zebra-drawn carriage. The museum's Zebra Cafe alludes to Lord Rothschild's love of zebras and has photographs of his trained zebras harnessed to open carriages.\n\nThe extensive collection, housed in several rooms, includes extinct animals and birds such as the quagga, thylacine, great auk and reconstructions of the moa and dodo. Oddities include hybrids and examples of abnormal coloration. The dogs display was relocated to the Rothschild Zoological Museum from the Natural History Museum, South Kensington, London after World War II. This shows how domestic dogs have changed shape due to selective breeding and includes the tiny Russian and Mexican lapdogs as well as famous racing greyhounds. The Museum has six galleries, each one of which houses a different set of animals. The first gallery contains birds, large carnivorans and primates, the second is used to show temporary exhibits, the third crocodilians, crustaceans, fishes, insects, large mammals and marine invertebrates, the fourth accommodates kangaroos and odd-toed ungulates, the fifth holds bovids, hippopotamuses, pigs and marine mammals, and finally the sixth gallery contains amphibians, bats, various British mammals, domestic dogs, ratites, lizards, snakes, turtles and small mammals. The Museum also contains a Discovery Room, designed for young children and the Rothschild Room which is a room set out to recreate the surroundings that the Rothschild family would have worked in. It became part of the Natural History Museum in 1937. In April 2007 its name was changed to the Natural History Museum at Tring. \n\nThe site is also home to the ornithological research collections (Bird Group, Department of Zoology) and the ornithological library (Department of Library and Information Services) of The Natural History Museum, but these are not open to the public. There are small special themed exhibitions throughout the year showcasing specimens not normally on display, as well as activities for youngsters.\n\nOn 24 June 2009 a theft occurred from the museum involving removal of 299 brightly coloured stuffed birds, mostly male trogons and quetzals from Central and South America, as well as birds of paradise from the island of New Guinea some of which had been collected by Alfred Russel Wallace.. The police announced on 12 November 2010 that a 22-year-old US citizen had been arrested, in the Tring area, in connection with the theft and the majority of bird skins had been recovered. Edwin Rist, a student at The Royal Academy of Music, pleaded guilty to the theft on 24 November 2010. In April 2011 Rist was given a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and a supervision order. He was also required to repay £125,150, the estimated proceeds from selling the skins through such outlets as eBay. The police also advised that 191 intact bird skins had so far been recovered, of which only 101 had labels recording the birds' key scientific data.\n\nIn the early hours of 27 August 2011 a thief broke in through the museum's front doors and removed the horns from two rhinoceros exhibits, one Indian rhino the other a white rhino, using, it was believed a large hammer. However, in the light of recent thefts from other museums, three months before the break-in, curators had replaced the real rhino horns, valued at £240,000, with replica ones made from resin which had no commercial value. On 17 January 2012 Darren Bennett from Leicester was charged with the theft of two replica rhinoceros horns.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2539819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2539819", "title": "Public records", "text": "Public records\n\nPublic records are documents or pieces of information that are not considered confidential and generally pertain to the conduct of government.\n\nFor example, in California, when a couple fills out a marriage license application, they have the option of checking the box as to whether the marriage is \"confidential\" (Record will be closed, and not opened to public once recorded) or \"public\" (record will become public record once recorded). Essentially, if the marriage record is public, a copy of the record can be ordered from the county in which the marriage occurred.\n\nSince the earliest organised societies, with taxation, disputes, and so on, records of some sort have been needed. In ancient Babylon records were kept in cuneiform writing on clay tablets. In the Inca empire of South America, which did not have writing, records were kept via an elaborate form of knots in cords, quipu, whose meaning has been lost.\n\nIn Western Europe in the Late Middle Ages public records included census records as well as records of birth, death, and marriage; an example is the 1086 \"Domesday Book\" of William the Conqueror. The details of royal marriage agreements, which were effectively international treaties, were also recorded. The United Kingdom Public Record Office Act, which formalised record-keeping by setting up the Public Record Office, was passed in 1838.\n\n\nAlthough public records are records of public business, they are not necessarily available without restriction, although Freedom of Information legislation (FOI) that has been gradually introduced in many jurisdictions since the 1960s has made access easier. Each government has policies and regulations that govern the availability of information contained in public records. A common restriction is that data about a person is not normally available to others; for example, the California Public Records Act (PRA) states that \"except for certain explicit exceptions, personal information maintained about an individual may not be disclosed without the person's consent\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Cabinet papers were subject to the thirty-year rule: until the introduction of FOI legislation, Cabinet papers were not available for thirty years; some information could be withheld for longer. the rule still applies to some information, such as minutes of Cabinet meetings.\n\nSome companies provide access, for a fee, to many public records available on the Internet. Many of them specialize in particular types of information, while some offer access to different types of record, typically to professionals in various fields. Some companies sell software with a promise of unlimited access to public records, but may provide nothing more than basic information on how to access already available and generally free public websites.\n\nEach year news media, civic groups, libraries, nonprofits, schools and others interested groups sponsor \"Sunshine Week.\" Sunshine Week occurs in mid-March, coinciding with James Madison's birthday and National Freedom of Information Day on the 16th. The purpose of the week is to highlight the idea that \"government functions best when it operates in the open.\"\n\nIn many states, state legislatures are often exempt from public-records laws that apply to state executive officials and local officials. In 2016, the Associated Press made a request for the emails and daily schedules of state legislative leaders (speakers of state Houses and presidents of state Senates) in all 50 states; a majority denied the request.\n\nOf particular significance was the evolution of the common-law right \"to access court records to inspect and to copy\". The expectation inherent in the common law right to access court records is that any person may come to the office of the clerk of the court during business hours and request to inspect court records, with almost instantaneous access. Such right is a central safeguard of the integrity of the courts. Any decision to conceal court records requires a sealing order. The right to access court records is also central to liberty: There is no conceivable way to exercise the Habeas Corpus right, deemed by the late Justice Brennan as \"the cornerstone\" of the United States Constitution, absent access to court records as public records.\n\nIn the United States the common law right to \"access court records to inspect and to copy\" was reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Nixon v Warner Communications, Inc\" (1978), where the court found various parts of the right to access court records as inherent to the First, Fourth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. In the United States access to court records is governed by Civil Rights in the Amendments to the United States Constitution, not by the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nAs court records become increasingly more accessible online, concerns about the undermining of private information has become a significant issue. In the past, obtaining court records required people to physically go to a courthouse and request documents, making privacy concerns essentially obsolete. However, with the relative ease at which people can now access these records, highly sensitive information (i.e. victim names, social security numbers, etc.) are at risk of being publicly exploited.\n\nAccess to U.S. national public records is guided by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Requests for access to records pursuant to FOIA may be refused by federal agencies if information requested is subject to exemption, or some information may be redacted (deleted).\n\nIn addition to the national FOIA, all states have some form of FOI legislation. For example, Colorado has the Colorado Open Records Act (CORA); in New Jersey the law is known as the Open Public Records Act (OPRA).\n\nThere are many degrees of accessibility to public records between states, with some making it fairly easy to request and receive documents, and others with many exemptions and restricted categories of documents. One state that is fairly responsive to public records requests is New York, which utilizes the Committee on Open Government to assist citizens with their requests. A state that was fairly restrictive in how they respond to public records requests is Pennsylvania, where the law formerly presumed that all documents are exempt from disclosure, unless they can be proven otherwise. This was changed by a 2008 bill that went into effect in 2009.. The California Public Records Act (\"California Government Code\" §§6250-6276.48) covers the arrest and booking records of inmates in the State of California jails and prisons, which are not covered by First Amendment rights (freedom of speech and of the press). Public access to arrest and booking records is seen as a critical safeguard of liberty.\n\nWith the advent of the Internet and the information age, access to public records in the United States to anyone who wishes to view them has dramatically increased. Third parties such as the information broker industry make regular use of public records to compile readily accessible profiles on millions of people, and may make a profit from the service of recompiling and mining the data.\n\nPublic record data is used for multiple purposes, such as ensuring that child support payments are made as determined by the courts, assisting credit bureaus in keeping accurate data and helping to pay pension benefits to retirees.\n\nIndividual criminal histories are generally considered to be public records in the United States and are often accessed via criminal history background checks, but \"access and use of FBI-maintained criminal history record information has been traditionally limited and controlled in large measure to protect the privacy of the individuals to whom the records pertain.\" The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes \"fair information-practice requirements by consumer reporting agencies that report public record information, such as criminal history records, for employment purposes,\" and some state consumer-protection laws impose more restrictive regulations.\n\nAccording to the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press, in the United States, arrest records \"are generally open to the public unless they concern an active or ongoing investigation. A few states restrict the information that can be obtained from an arrest record, especially when it concerns individuals who were never charged, were acquitted or had their records expunged. Again, the determination will often result in a balancing test comparing the public's interest in disclosure against the individual privacy interest.\" By contrast, protective custody and juvenile delinquency records are exempted from most state open-records laws, such that access is \"limited to the juvenile, his or her parents or guardians, or other parties directly involved in a legal matter.\"\n\nIn early 2018, the National Archives put up a webpage, \"Unauthorized Disposition of Federal Records,\" to publish all instances of investigations into possible unauthorized destruction of records.\n\n\n\n"}

The court found that the evidence on which a jury is entitled to convict upon a criminal charge is evidence on which reasonable men could properly convict.
