Williams attended the 1944 Summer Music Institute. She was the first African-American student to be enrolled at Black Mountain College and the first black student to openly integrate a Southern white college.\n\nAlma Stone Williams was highly educated. She attended Spelman College at the age of 15, majoring in English and music, and graduating valedictorian. Afterwards, she received her M.A. degree in English from Atlanta University. Williams began her teaching career at Penn School on St. Helena Island in South Carolina. After which, Educator Horace Mann Bond hired Williams to teach at Fort Valley State College and; furthermore, he nominated her to attend Black Mountain in the summer of 1944.\n\nIn 1944, Williams became the first black student at Black Mountain College, ten years before the United States Supreme Court's decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka\" declaring state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. In a 2008 profile in the Ashville, North Carolina Urban News; Alma Williams commented on her pioneering desegregation:\n<poem>\n“Pioneering did not frighten me. I was accustomed to studying and living with white teachers at Spelman and to reaching for high standards in all areas.”\n</poem>\n\nAfterwards, in 1945, she received a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship Fellowship to attend the Juilliard School in New York City. Furthermore, she received a 2nd Masters degree, this time in musicology, from the University of Maryland, where she wrote her master’s thesis on Brahms.\n\nAt Fort Valley State College, where she returned to teach, Williams married a professor, Russell Williams, Sr. After his early death she taught at Savannah State University, South Carolina State University, and private music lessons to support their five children. Alma Stone Williams retired with two decades experience as a highly respected professor of English and Humanities at Savannah State.\n\nIn retirement, Williams was co-founder of SONATA (Sponsors of New and Talented Artists), an organization that provides funds for children of Savannah to study music with former members of the Savannah Symphony Orchestra and other music professionals.\n\nShe is featured in “Fully Awake,” a documentary about Black Mountain College. Additionally, there are two other films in process about Williams. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "160673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160673", "title": "BogoMips", "text": "BogoMips\n\nBogoMips (from \"bogus\" and MIPS) is an unscientific measurement of CPU speed made by the Linux kernel when it boots to calibrate an internal busy-loop. An often-quoted definition of the term is \"the number of million times per second a processor can do absolutely nothing\".\n\nBogoMips is a value that can be used to verify whether the processor in question is in the proper range of similar processors, i.e. BogoMips represents a processor's clock frequency as well as the potentially present CPU cache. It is not usable for performance comparisons among different CPUs.\n\nIn 1993, Lars Wirzenius posted an email message explaining the reasons for its introduction in the Linux kernel on comp.os.linux:\n\nAs a very approximate guide, the BogoMips can be pre-calculated by the following table. The given rating is typical for that CPU with the then current and applicable Linux version. The index is the ratio of \"BogoMips per clock speed\" for any CPU to the same for an Intel 386DX CPU, for comparison purposes.\n\nSource\n\nFor a complete list, refer to the BogoMips mini-Howto.\n\nWith the 2.2.14 Linux kernel, a caching setting of the CPU state was moved from behind to before the BogoMips calculation. Although the BogoMips algorithm itself wasn't changed, from that kernel onward the BogoMips rating for then current Pentium CPUs was twice that of the rating before the change. The changed BogoMips outcome had no effect on real processor performance.\n\nLinux command for visualization bogomips : $ cat /proc/cpuinfo\n\nWith kernel 2.6.x, BogoMIPS are implemented in the codice_1 kernel source file. It computes the Linux kernel timing parameter codice_2 (see jiffy) value. The explanation from source code:\ncodice_2 is used to implement codice_4 (delay in microseconds) and codice_5 (delay in nanoseconds) functions. These functions are needed by some drivers to wait for hardware. Note that a busy waiting technique is used, so the kernel is effectively blocked when executing codice_5/codice_4 functions. For i386 architecture codice_8 is implemented in codice_9 as:\n\nequivalent to the following assembler code\n\nwhich can be rewritten to C-pseudocode\nFull and complete information and details about BogoMips, and hundreds of reference entries can be found in the (outdated) BogoMips mini-Howto.\n\nIn 2012, ARM contributed a new codice_4 implementation allowing the system timer built into many ARMv7 CPUs to be used instead of a busy-wait loop. This implementation was released in Version 3.6 of the Linux kernel. Timer-based delays are more robust on systems that use frequency scaling to dynamically adjust the processor's speed at runtime, as codice_11 values may not necessarily scale linearly. Also, since the timer frequency is known in advance, no calibration is needed at boot time.\n\nOne side effect of this change is that the BogoMIPS value will reflect the timer frequency, not the CPU's core frequency. Typically the timer frequency is much lower than the processor's maximum frequency, and some users may be surprised to see an unusually low BogoMIPS value when comparing against systems that use traditional busy-wait loops.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the eight White Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal., and one of the most complex monuments of Russian medieval architecture. It was originally constructed during the reign of Vladimir II Monomakh during the late 11th century.\n\nThe Cathedral of the Nativity is surrounded by a ring of earthen walls in an oxbow of Kamenka River. It is notable for being the first city cathedral not built for the exclusive use of the knyaz or his relatives. The cathedral contains the remains of a son of Yuri Dolgoruki, knyazes of the Shuisky family and others.\n\nThe cathedral was originally built during the reign of Vladimir II Monomakh in 1102. In 1222, on the orders of Yuri II of Vladimir the dilapidated building was taken down and replaced by a new one built of white stone. Thus it remained until 1528, when the white stone walls above the arcade are replaced by brick. In the 17th century, the previously three-domed cathedral was given five domes and the interior was partially repainted. Thus the cathedral survives to this day with numerous changes throughout its history, both in the exterior, and the interior, where the wall frescoes are of 13th-, 15th- and 17th-century origin. The cathedral has also endured fire several times.\n\n\n"}

The foreword is written by Michael Broadbent. A smaller reduced version, \"Champagne & Sparkling Wine Guide\", is published in the soft cover format.\n\nWhen first published in 1998, the book became the only wine book to warrant a leader in a UK national newspaper (\"The Guardian\", October 14, 1998), for the first time revealing a 17th-century document proving that the English used a second fermentation to convert still wines into sparkling at least six years before Dom Pérignon arrived at the Abbey of Hautvillers, and nearly 40 years before the French claim that sparkling Champagne was invented. Although \"Le Figaro\" accused Stevenson of “trying to burn Dom Pérignon”, the French were prompt to award it The Best Wine Book of 1998 at the Salon International du Livre Gourmand in Périgueux.\n\nRanked among its \"Top Ten Best Wine Books\" by \"The Independent\" it has been characterised as \"still the best guide to fizz”, \"authoritative, opinionated and comprehensive\", and a vital purchase for any Champagne lover.\n\nThe book opens with \"A Little History\", accounting numerous occurrences throughout time of accidental sparkling wine, and the first documented evidence of a deliberately produced sparkling wine, as recorded by Christopher Merret. In Merret’s eight-page paper \"Some observations concerning the ordering of wines\", which he presented to the newly formed Royal Society on December 17, 1662, he states “our wine-coopers of recent times use vast quantities of sugar and molasses to all sorts of wines to make them drink brisk and sparkling”. Stevenson explains why the French did not have the technology to produce any sparkling wine in 1662, and how it was almost inevitable that the English did. He explains the paradox of \"sparkling champaign\", which is mentioned by George Etheredge in The Man of Mode in 1676, yet did not exist in France until the late 1690s. The documentary evidence presented is a significant aspect of \"Christie’s World Encyclopedia of Champagne & Sparkling Wine\", though only a part of it.\n\nAn overview of the six different methods of sparkling wine production is provided in \"How Sparkling Wines Are Made\", exploring the most important of these in the sections \"A Step-by-Step Guide to \"Méthode Champenoise\" and \"The Elusive Quality Factor\". Argumenting that intrinsic quality exists beyond the personal preference of taste, Stevenson analyses what precisely contributes to the intrinsic quality of a sparkling wine, starting with establishing the vineyard, from site selection to the varieties of grape, and how they should be grown, harvested, and pressed, looking at ripeness levels and acidity, through every aspect of the production process.\n\nStevenson offers an argument why chaptalisation might actually contribute to Champagne’s perceived \"lean\" structure. He discusses ideal fermentation temperatures to give a \"fast and furious first fermentation\" and a long \"low-temperature second fermentation\", the pros and cons of malolactic fermentation, what the \"assemblage\" is, how to obtain good mousse retention, the importance of small bubbles, what affects their size, the effects of autolysis, ageing on lees, adding a \"dosage\" and post-disgorgement ageing. Stevenson also tests out nine Riedel glasses on 100 different Champagnes and sparkling wines, offering his conclusions alongside Riedel’s official design purpose.\n\nThe main section of this book consists of a country-by-country, region-by-region assessment of sparkling wines, with every producer rated on a 100-point scale, and all their wines given a star wine rating (three star maximum). Champagne receives the largest coverage, occupying 98 pages, but 10 other French regions (Alsace, Loire, Burgundy, Bordeaux, Limoux, others) receive 45 pages, while 141 pages covers the rest of the world (Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Austria, Southeast Europe, other European, South Africa, The United States, California, Others USA, Canada, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia). These pages hold technical data and the historical development of sparkling wines locally, as well as Stevenson’s own critiques of the producers, the lowest rating of which is 35, demonstrating his policy to utilise all 100 points of the scale.\n\n\n"}

Remarkable for its comprehensiveness and size, Morohashi's dictionary contains over 50,000 character entries and 530,000 compound words. Haruo Shirane (2003:15) says: \"This is the definitive dictionary of the Chinese characters and one of the great dictionaries of the world.\"\n\nTetsuji Morohashi was originally motivated to create a dictionary in 1917 when he went to China to study Chinese. Trying to look up words in the largest available Chinese dictionaries was frustrating; the \"Kangxi Zidian\" defines characters but not phrases, the \"Peiwen Yunfu\" lists phrases without definitions, and the \"Zhonghua Da Zidian\" had just been published. Morohashi's autobiography explains (Wilkinson 2000:74) that \"he had to spend between a quarter and a third of his study time trying to find the meanings of words and phrases. This tedium he felt could be avoided if there were a dictionary that provided both citations and definitions.\" When Morohashi returned to Japan in 1919, he had 20 notebooks filled with Chinese vocabulary. \n\nIn 1925, , president of the Taishukan publishing house, requested Morohashi to edit a comprehensive kanji dictionary of an unprecedented scale. In order to print this giant reference work, fonts for many rare characters had to be created, since none existed. The first volume was published in 1943, but the fire-bombing of Tokyo destroyed the printing plates and special fonts in 1945. After the war, Morohashi and his fellow editors reconstructed the dictionary from proofs. Due to a shortage of skilled craftsmen, Suzuki persuaded , inventor of phototypesetting, to recreate the necessary fonts. The first volume was published in 1955 and the final index volume in 1960. Morohashi was awarded the Order of the Chrysanthemum in 1957 and the Order of Culture in 1967 for his contributions to sinology and lexicography. Taishukan published a vocabulary index in 1990 and a supplemental volume in 2000.\n\nThe original (1955–1960) \"Dai Kan-Wa Jiten\" has 13 volumes totaling 13,757 pages, and includes 49,964 head entries for characters, with over 370,000 words and phrases. This unabridged dictionary, often called the \"Morohashi\" in English, focuses upon Classical Chinese and Literary Chinese vocabulary. It provides encyclopedic information about poetry, book titles, historical figures, place names, Buddhist terms, and even modern expressions. The \"Dai Kan-Wa Jiten\" is intended for reading Chinese and does not cover Japanese words created since the Meiji era.\n\nThis is the format for main character entries:\n\nOne archaism of the first edition is giving Japanese pronunciations of characters in historical kana usage rather than modern, retaining for instance now-obsolete \"wi\" and \"we\".\n\nEach individual volume has a radical-and-stroke sorting index arranged by Chinese radical or signific (following the 214 Kangxi radicals), and subdivided by the total number of remaining strokes in the character. For \"Dai Kan-Wa Jiten\" users unfamiliar with this traditional system of dictionary collation, the final index volume is an essential tool.\n\nVolume 13 contains four indices to the dictionary, which cite volume and page numbers for each character.\n\nVolume 13 also contains a listing 1,062 Chinese characters that the dictionary uses in definitions but does not include as main entries, plus the official 1,850 Japanese tōyō kanji for general use, and 517 simplified Chinese characters.\n\nSince the death of Tetsuji Morohashi in 1982 at the age of 99, Taishukan has published two \"Dai Kan-Wa Jiten\" augmentations that amount to Volumes 14 and 15.\n\nThe handy 1990 allows searching for words in Morohashi by their pronunciation in modern kana spelling, instead of the historical system used in Volumes 1-13. This index comprehensively lists every compound word listed in the main dictionary, including terms, phrases, four-character idioms, etc. Vocabulary is arranged in the standard ordering of \"kana\", and is cited by volume and page numbers.\n\nThe 2000 adds some 800 main character entries, approximately 33,000 new vocabulary terms, novel readings of characters, variant characters, etc. This last volume includes four types of character indexes. Like the \"Vocabulary Index\", this supplement uses standard modern \"kana\" but also provides the historical equivalents.\n\nDespite the competition from the CD-ROM version of the Hanyu Da Cidian, Taishukan has not released an electronic \"Dai Kan-Wa Jiten\" edition. This owes not only to the dictionary's huge scale but also to the fact many of its 50,000 characters could not be encoded until recently.\n\nThe (1962–1968) \"Zhongwen Da Cidian\", sometimes called the \"Chinese Morohashi\", is very similar in structure to \"Dai Kan-Wa Jiten\" and was one of the most comprehensive Chinese dictionaries available until 1993.\n\nIn 1982, Taishukan published an abridged \"family edition\" of the \"Dai Kan-Wa Jiten\". Their four-volume enters 20,769 characters and some 120,000 words. It adds early oracle bone script and bronzeware script examples, and proposes hypothetical Old Chinese etymologies and word families.\n\nKida Jun'ichirō wrote a Japanese book (1986) about the \"Dai Kan-Wa Jiten\", and edited another (1994) about lexicographers that discusses Morohashi's contributions (chap. 4) and Ishii's creation of characters (chap. 11).\n\n\n\n"}

Other age-focused fears are ephebiphobia and gerontophobia. Recognised outcomes of pedophobia include paternalism, adultism, and by extension, ageism.\n\nThe word \"pedophobia\" comes from the Greek roots παιδ- \"paid-\" \"child\" and φόβος \"-phóbos\" \"fear.\"\n\nThe fear of children has been diagnosed and treated by psychiatrists, with studies examining the effects of multiple forms of treatment. Sociologists have situated \"contemporary fears about children and childhood\", e.g. paedophobia, as \"contributing to the ongoing social construction of childhood\", suggesting that \"generational power relations, in which children's lives are bounded by adult surveillance\" affect many aspects of society. More than one study has identified the fear of children as a factor affecting biological conception in humans.\n\nPaedophobia is the \"raison d'etre\" for several international social justice movements addressing young people, including children's rights and youth participation. Major international organisations addressing paedophobia, either outright or by implication, include Save the Children and Children's Defense Fund. However, some organisations, particularly those associated with the youth rights movement, claim that these movements perpetuate paedophobia.\n\nThe complexity of this notion is exacerbated by observations by experts such as Letty Cottin Pogrebin, a founding editor of \"Ms. magazine\", who is said to have diagnosed America as having an \"epidemic of paedophobia\", saying that, \"though most of us make exceptions for our own offspring, we do not seem particularly warm-hearted towards other peoples' children.\"\n\nOne author suggests that the cause of the fear of children in academia specifically extends from adults' distinct awareness of the capacity of children as she wrote, \"Children embarrass us because they point ever too cleverly and clearly to our denial of personal, material, and maternal history.\" A separate report suggests that the source of current trends in the fear of children have a specific source, namely,\n\nAs mentioned above, social service, human rights, and social justice organizations have been tackling the fear of children for dozens of years. The United Nations has created the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is implicitly designed to address pedophobia by fostering intergenerational equity between children and adults.\n\nAs evidenced above, paedophobia is distinctly addressed by academic, especially evidenced since the creation of the field of Youth studies. The influence of the fear of children in American popular culture is examined by critical media analysts who have identified the effects of paedophobia in both Disney and horror films.\n\nA wide range of other authors and scholars, including Henry Giroux, Mike Males and Barbara Kingsolver, have suggested that the popular modern fear of children stems from corporatisation of mass media and its complicity with a range of political and economic interests. Males perhaps goes the furthest, and wrote an entire book exploring the subject.\n\nWhile there are many families in the world, not all couples or even humans desire to have families or children. The United States Bureau of the Census conducted a study in 1971, which they say the data still seems to be the same today concerning birth rates and parent-to-child ratios. They believe it is too early to say that (increased rates of childless families) foretell a future increase of childless homes in general or just later birth. The number of married couples voluntarily choosing to be childless are only increasing. As social trends are hard to predict and therefore fertility expectations, attitudes, behaviors and such are uneasy to consistently gather data for, leaving voluntarily childlessness hard to track. There is a forum on the popular website, Reddit, where self-described childfree individuals from around the world discuss the childfree lifestyle. \n\nAccording to Agnieszka Bień et al.,the amount of women choosing to remain childless is increasing for many reasons. This choice to remain childless is due to different and emerging socio-cultural factors including: a different outlook on a professional career and life, shifting focus to self-fulfillment and individualism, and changing patterns of norms of family types. In more recent years, society has become more open-minded and accepting to the choosing to not have children. Overpopulation and climate change are some other factors that influence a woman's decision to remain voluntarily childless. Not only is society accepting this idea and choice more, the choice of being childless to some degree is even becoming desired.\n\n\n"}

According to a traditional saying, Alsace has three great treasures: Strasbourg Cathedral, the Isenheim Altarpiece in Colmar and the Humanist Library in Sélestat.\nActually, there are in fact two Renaissance humanist libraries involved, the library of the Humanist School and the private library of the famous scholar, Beatus Rhenanus (1485–1547).\n\nIn 1441, the municipal authorities of Sélestat appointed Ludwig Dringenberg, born in Westphalia, to be the leader of the local Latin school. The appointment proved to be a stroke of luck. Dringenberg turned out to be a gifted and committed educator, who had an open attitude toward intellectual trends of the time. Under his leadership emerged the first school on the Upper Rhine where Humanist thinking was fostered. His successors, Kraft Hofman (1477–1501), Hieronymus Gebwiler (1501–1509) and Hans Sapidus (1510–1525), knew how to increase the reputation of the school still further. Thus, the school was the training place of an entire generation of Alsatian Humanists. The school also had a library which steadily grew in extent through endowments and gifts (from Jakob Wimpfeling of Sélestat, among others).\n\nBeatus Rhenanus bequeathed his entire private library to his home city of Sélestat. This library contained about 670 bound leather volumes at the time of this death in 1547, which Rhenanus had collected during his studies and his work in Strasbourg, Basel, Paris and Sélestat. Even at that time, the library was of inestimable value, since books were only published in small numbers of copies and they were extremely expensive. The library of Beatus Rhenanus is the only larger Humanist library preserved virtually intact. Other large libraries, such as those of Erasmus von Rotterdam or Johannes Reuchlin, were scattered after the deaths of their owners.\n\nThe Library of Beatus Rhenanus was inscribed in the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2011.\n\nThe Alsatian Humanists closely associated with the expansion of the library include:\n\nSince 1889, both libraries have been housed under a single roof in a former covered market near the Gothic church of Saint George. The library is publicly accessible as a museum and the books can be consulted by scholars and researchers. The collection boasts as many as 550 incunabula, 460 ancient and modern manuscripts, 2,200 16th century prints, 1,600 17th century prints and 2,600 18th century prints, including the Sélestat Lectionary. The rooms also display a collection of 15th and 16th century Upper-Rhenish religious paintings and sculpture.\n\n"}
{"id": "889020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=889020", "title": "Incorporation (linguistics)", "text": "Incorporation (linguistics)\n\nIncorporation is a phenomenon by which a grammatical category, such as a verb, forms a compound with its direct object (object incorporation) or adverbial modifier, while retaining its original syntactic function. The inclusion of a noun qualifies the verb, narrowing its scope rather than making reference to a specific entity.\n\nIncorporation is central to many polysynthetic languages such as those found in North America, Siberia and northern Australia. However, polysynthesis does not necessarily imply incorporation (Mithun 2009); neither does the presence of incorporation in a language imply that that language is polysynthetic.\n\nAlthough incoroporation does not occur regularly, English uses it sometimes:\"breastfeed\", and direct object incorporation, as in \"babysit\". Etymologically, such verbs in English are usually back-formations: the verbs \"breastfeed\" and \"babysit\" are formed from the adjective \"breast-fed\" and the noun \"babysitter\" respectively. Incorporation and plain compounding may be fuzzy categories: consider \"backstabbing\", \"name-calling\", \"axe murder\".\n\nThe following example from Oneida (Iroquoian) illustrates noun incorporation.\n\nIn this example, the verbal root \"hninu\" appears with its usual verbal morphology: a factive marker (FACT), which very roughly translates as past tense, although this is not quite accurate; an agreement marker (1.SG), which tells us that the verb agrees with 1st person singular (the speaker); and an aspect marker, punctual (PUNC), which tells us that this is a completed event. The direct object \"ne kanaktaʼ\" follows the verb. The function of the particle \"ne\" is unclear. Note that the word for bed consists of a root \"nakt\" plus a prefix and a suffix. The notion of the root is important here, but the properties of the prefix and suffix do not matter for this discussion.\n\nThe following sentence means the same as above, but noun incorporation has taken place.\n\nIn this example, the root for bed \"nakt\" has \"incorporated\" into the verbal construction and appears before the verbal root. Two other incidental changes are noticed here. First, the agreement marker in the first example is \"k\" and in the second example is \"ke\". These are two phonologically-conditioned allomorphs. In other words, the choice between using \"k\" and \"ke\" is based on the other sounds in the word (and has nothing to do with noun incorporation). Also, there is an epenthetic vowel \"a\" between the nominal and verbal roots. This vowel is inserted to break up an illegal consonant cluster (and also has nothing to do with noun incorporation).\n\nThe next example, from Panare, illustrates the cross-linguistically common phenomenon that the incorporated form of a noun may be significantly different from its unincorporated form. The first sentence contains the incorporated form \"u<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" of \"head\", and the second its unincorporated form \"ipu\":\n\nChukchi, a Paleosiberian language spoken in North Eastern Siberia, provides a wealth of examples of noun incorporation. The phrase \"təpelarkən qoraŋə\" means \"I'm leaving the reindeer\" and has two words (the verb in the first person singular, and the noun). The same idea can be expressed with the single word \"təqorapelarkən\", in which the noun root \"qora-\" \"reindeer\" is incorporated into the verb word.\n\nMohawk, an Iroquoian language, makes heavy use of incorporation, as in: \"watia'tawi'tsherí:io\" \"it is a good shirt\", where the noun root \"atia'tawi\" \"upper body garment\" is present inside the verb.\n\nCheyenne, an Algonquian language of the plains, also uses noun incorporation on a regular basis. Consider \"nátahpe'emaheona\", meaning \"I have a big house\", which contains the noun morpheme \"maheo\" \"house\".\n\nChinese makes extensive use of \"verb-object compounds\", which are compounds composed of two constituents having the syntactic relation of verb and its direct object. For example, the verb \"shuì-jiào\" 睡觉 'sleep (VO)' is composed of the verb \"shuì\" 睡 'sleep (V)' and the bound morpheme object \"jiào\" 觉 'sleep (N)'. Aspect markers (e.g. \"le\" 了 PERFECTIVE), classifier phrases (e.g. 三個鐘頭 \"sān ge zhōngtóu\" THREE + CL + hours), and other elements may separate the two constituents of these compounds, though different verb-object compounds vary in degree of separability.\n\nIn many cases, a phrase with an incorporated noun carries a different meaning with respect to the equivalent phrase where the noun is not incorporated into the verb. The difference seems to hang around the generality and definiteness of the statement. The incorporated phrase is usually generic and indefinite, while the non-incorporated one is more specific.\n\nIn Yucatec Maya, for example, the phrase \"I chopped a tree\", when the word for \"tree\" is incorporated, changes its meaning to \"I chopped wood\". In Lahu (a Tibeto-Burman language), the definite phrase \"I drink the liquor\" becomes the more general \"I drink liquor\" when \"liquor\" is incorporated. The Japanese phrase 目を覚ます \"me o samasu\" means \"to wake up\" or literally \"to wake (one's) eyes\". But when the direct object is incorporated into the nominal form of the verb, the resulting noun 目覚まし \"mezamashi\" literally means \"waking up\", as in 目覚まし時計　\"mezamashidokei\" meaning \"alarm clock.\"\n\nThis tendency is not a rule. There are languages where noun incorporation does not produce a meaning change (though it may cause a change in syntax — as explained below).\n\nNoun incorporation usually deletes one of the arguments of the verb, and in some languages this is shown explicitly. That is, if the verb is transitive, the verb word with an incorporated direct object becomes formally intransitive and marked as such. In other languages this change does not take place, or at least it is not shown by explicit morphology.\n\nIn Lakhota, a Siouan language of the plains, for example, the phrase \"the man is chopping wood\" can be expressed either as a transitive \"wičháša kiŋ čháŋ kiŋ kaksáhe\" (\"man the wood the chopping\") or as an intransitive \"wičháša kiŋ čhaŋkáksahe\" (\"man the wood-chopping\") in which the independent nominal \"čháŋ\", \"wood,\" becomes a root incorporated into the verb: \"wood-chopping.\"\n\nThe noun may not be deleted after all. In the Oneida language (an Iroquoian language spoken in Southern Ontario and Wisconsin), one finds classifier noun incorporation, in which a generic noun acting as a direct object can be incorporated into a verb, but a more specific direct object is left in place. In a rough translation, one would say for example \"I animal-bought this pig\", where \"animal\" is the generic incorporated noun. Note that this \"classifier\" is not an actual classifier (i.e. a class agreement morpheme) but a common noun.\n\nAs proposed by Mithun (1984), one of the major origins of incorporation is coalescence between noun and verb. Another proposed origin is the denominal derivation of a nominal compound containing a noun root and a verb root (Jacques 2012).\n\nIn 1985, Mithun also introduced a four type system to define the functionality and progression of noun incorporation in a language. The first and simplest type, known as lexical compounding, involves a verb incorporating a nominal argument. The resulting compound usually describes a noteworthy or recurring activity. The second type uses the same process to manipulate case roles, incorporating the argument into the verb to allow for a new argument to take its place. Type III uses noun incorporation to background old or established information. A speaker might explicitly mention an entity once, for example, and thereafter refer to it using an incorporated verbal compound. The fourth and final type proposed by Mithun involves the development of a set of classificatory compounds, in which verbs are paired with generic nouns to describe properties of an entity, rather than the entity itself. This type was previously mentioned as a feature of the Oneida language.\n\nAccording to Mithun, languages exhibiting any of these types always display all of the lower types as well. This seems to imply a pattern of progression, as Mithun describes in her 1984 paper on the evolution of noun incorporation.\n\nIncorporation can in its turn change into other constructions, such as denominal derivation, applicative, directional affixes (Mattisen 2006, Mithun 2009)\n\n\nExamples and text were taken from\n\n"}

Determined to help, the duo rush off to the Museum's entrance, and once they come inside, they are greeted by a painter named Picoo who traps them inside a piece of artwork. Klonoa and Huepow must fight their way through five worlds within the Museum itself before finding the source of all their troubles and restoring the moon to the sky.\n\nSetting the standard for all the future \"Klonoa\" handheld titles, \"Moonlight Museum\" displays several standard features for an action sidescroller. The player controls Klonoa as he runs, jumps, and fights his way across several worlds, solving small puzzles in the process. Klonoa defeats enemies by picking them up using a special weapon called the \"wind bullet\", a ring-shaped object inlaid with a small blue jewel that can fire a small burst of wind straight forward and draw in an enemy, allowing for Klonoa to pick them up over his head. Once he has them, Klonoa can either throw them straight forward, taking out any enemies they happen to hit, or use them to perform a double jump, giving him access to places he otherwise could not reach. Also, by holding the jump button, Klonoa can hover in midair for a short duration by flapping his large ears, which also slightly increases his jump distance.\n\nBy completing all five worlds and beating the game, Klonoa can access special bonus stages called \"EX Stages\".\n\nThe game itself is divided into five worlds, each of which is split into six stages called \"visions\". At the end of each stage, Klonoa must find a door which is unlocked by finding all 3 stars within the vision itself. There are also 30 crystals (or \"dream stones\") in each vision, collect all these to finish part of the picture shown at the end of the vision (one picture per world). In addition, Klonoa can also find hearts that can replenish his health, as well as 1-up items that look like Klonoa's hat. There are no boss battles in this game.\n\n\"Moonlight Museum\" was announced a month before its release in April 1999 as a side-story to the original \"Klonoa: Door to Phantomile\" for the PlayStation. The game was in development simultaneously with \"\" for the PlayStation 2, with the production of both games headed by Hideo Yoshizawa. While the \"Klonoa 2\" team focused more on \"action\", \"Moonlight Museum\"s crew was instructed to focus on the \"puzzle\" aspect, a trend that would continue for subsequent handheld games in the series.\n\n\"Kaze no Klonoa: Moonlight Museum\" entered the Japanese sales charts as the 10th best-selling game during its debut week. In a review of an import version in 2000, IGN called the title \"a WonderSwan platformer that's cute, cuddly... and painfully average\" finding the level design to be \"decent (if not a little dull)\" and visuals that didn't push the limits of the handheld. The website remarked that the title could be played equally well on the WonderSwan's horizontal or vertical display modes, and the audio was \"decidedly above-average\" despite limited background music.\n\n"}

Conceived by Harry Doddema and Dan Carlson in September 2003 and officially launched on December 5 of that year, it uses the wiki model and is hosted by Wikia, Inc. on the MediaWiki software. Memory Alpha contains over 40,000 articles in its English edition alone , making it one of the largest wiki projects. The site is also available in several other languages, including Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, and Swedish.\n\nMemory Alpha aims to create a comprehensive database for all fans, but was not conceived as a wiki. Two concerns spurred its creation: many \"Star Trek\" references of the time were incomplete, and the most promising would shut down regularly, like the site TrekPulse, which closed inexplicably in late 2005 to be reborn the next year as TrekCore. Doddema and Carlson christened their project Memory Alpha, after the Federation's largest information archive, from the original series episode \"The Lights of Zetar\".\n\nThe two decided on a wiki format, which allowed for more collaboration than other formats available. As Carlson said in the Charlotte Observer, \"The idea I latched onto with the wiki concept is you can spread the work around. Everyone can pitch in and go in on their own special interest.\" After experimenting with TikiWiki software, they switched to the MediaWiki platform, finding it less cumbersome. The platform of choice for Wikimedia Foundation projects proved to be, in their opinion, more stable and efficient, and they brought a testsite online on November 11, 2003. Memory Alpha officially launched on December 5 that year.\n\nThe site gained momentum in the following months, aided by a mention on the \"Star Trek\" fan site \"TrekNation\" on December 23. Memory Alpha reached 1,000 articles by January 12, 2004, but on March 23, the site's database was accidentally erased during an upgrade of the MediaWiki software. Although this caused six weeks of work to be lost, the project expanded to include Dutch and German versions on April 10 and May 14 respectively. It remained stable until the following year, when the fees associated with hosting the site became more than the founders could afford.\n\nIn February 2005, Memory Alpha switched hosting servers and joined Wikia, a free for-profit wiki-hosting company started by Wikimedia Foundation board members Jimmy Wales and Angela Beesley. The site remained stable on Wikia, opening a Swedish site on May 5 and a French one on November 5. It also received several distinctions that year, such as the \"Ex Astris Excellentia\" award from Ex Astris Scientia, a \"Star Trek\" reference site, in September 2005, and it was featured as the Sci-Fi Channel's Site of the Week for October 10, 2005. \"\" and \"\" writer/producer Mike Sussman joined the community that year as well.\n\nTechnical issues led the MediaWiki software to believe Memory Alpha was started on November 23, 2004, and despite the inaccuracy, this date was adopted \"ex post facto\" as Memory Alpha's \"birthday\".\n\nThe latter part of 2005 and early 2006 saw several new features added to the site. Among these was a peer review process, implemented on September 21, 2005 in response to questions about the process by which articles become featured. On November 20 of that year, Memory Alpha began a \"Babel\" program, inspired by and modeled after that of the Wikimedia Commons, to help users who speak the same language. Other recent innovations include an area for user projects, sometimes referred to as on other wikis, and coverage of fan films.\n\nThe site has remained popular since its inception, although its growth has slowed in recent times. For instance, it was the largest project on Wikia until October 2005, when its article count was surpassed by Wookieepedia and Uncyclopedia. Today, it has approximately 1300 registered users (80 of whom are active) and upwards of 17 million page views since its move to Wikia. , it receives on average, slightly more visitors and page views per day than the official \"Star Trek\" website according to Alexa.\n\nMemory Alpha has influenced the design of other wikicities dedicated to information about television franchises, including and the . It is a resource used by mainstream journalists for information on \"Star Trek\" related issues. Influential edublogger Will Richardson hailed the site in his 2006 book \"Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms\" as \"one of the most impressive [wikis] out there\".\n\nOn June 12, 2007, Memory Alpha reached a milestone of 25,000 articles with the creation of the article .\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" named Memory Alpha one of the 25 Essential Fansites in 2007. In comparing it to other \"Star Trek\" sites, the reviewer wrote, \"Memory Alpha wins out for its handsome, intuitive presentation and its overwhelming mass\".\n\nIt was revealed in April 2016 that actor and writer for \"Star Trek Beyond\", Simon Pegg, used Memory Alpha as a canon resource in writing of the film, even asking the community's leaders to name and give etymology for a device in the film.\n\nSeveral aspects of Memory Alpha set it apart from other reference works, such as its method of citing sources. All information must be cited from a valid source (see Canon section below), but rather than a \"Works Cited\" or \"References\" list, Memory Alpha prefers stand-alone inline citations, which are placed in parentheses after the sentence or section in question. For television episodes, this consists of an abbreviation for the series from which the information came (e.g. DS9 for \"\"), followed by the name of the episode in double quotation marks. So, to cite information from the \"\" (TNG) pilot \"Encounter at Farpoint\", one would add: (TNG: \"Encounter at Farpoint\"). The same rule applies for films, without the series prefix and with italics in place of quotation marks. The same method of notation is also used in the printed \"Star Trek Encyclopedia\", which is unrelated to the Memory Alpha wiki.\n\nArticles on Memory Alpha are written from two points of view: \"in-universe\", which are written as if the reader is a part of the \"Star Trek\" universe, and \"production\", which speak from a real-world perspective. For \"in-universe\" articles, behind-the-scenes information is not included in the main body of the article; rather, it is placed in a separate background section or included indented and italicized to separate it from the in-universe perspective. The latter method is used in cases where either the information is particularly important (such as conflicting information from two canonical sources) or there is not enough background to justify a separate section. In most cases, the background method is preferred and italics are used sparingly.\n\nLike many wikis, Memory Alpha has a section for \"featured articles\", those believed to represent the best the community has to offer. The criteria for this distinction are that an article must be well written, comprehensive (which includes citing sources), accurate and undisputed – criteria any article could hypothetically fulfill. This has caused some conflict over the criteria involved (see Current issues section). To be featured, an article must be nominated by a user and unanimously supported by at least five other users; any objections must be fixable and may be invalidated if deemed irrational or unreasonable. Each week, one of the site's featured articles becomes the \"Article of the Week\" to be displayed on the project home page.\n\nSeveral methods of communication are available beyond conventional talk pages. The \"community portal\" section of the website is named after Ten Forward, a locale frequented by characters on \"The Next Generation\". Issues discussed there range from disputes between users to new ideas on how to improve the site to upcoming projects. A separate area, the reference desk, exists for discussions and questions related to what is considered part of the canon, discrepancies between sources, and other such topics. However, \"meta-Trek\" topics (a term used for \"Star Trek\"-related topics that do not pertain in any way to Memory Alpha) are not discussed on the wiki; a separate IRC chatroom exists for these discussions.\n\nThe question of canonicity is a complex one and has plagued fans since \"Star Trek\" began in 1966. The general policy of Paramount Pictures is that anything outside live-action television episodes and movies is apocryphal, or non-canonical. However, grey areas in this policy, especially in relation to the canonical status of \"\" (TAS), further complicate the matter and have led to many debates among fans. In light of this, Memory Alpha crafted its own unique definition of canon in relation to what may be used as a \"valid resource\". \"The Animated Series\" is included as valid, or canonical, for a number of reasons, such as the fact that \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry and most of the cast of were involved with it and the existence of several references to TAS events in later series.\n\nInformation taken from the \"Star Trek Encyclopedia\" and \"Star Trek Chronology\" is mostly accepted on Memory Alpha as well, to the extent that it does not break from established on-screen facts. Content from these sources is an acknowledged grey area of Memory Alpha's canon policy and is disregarded if deemed speculative or contradictory. Thus, in some ways they hold the same weight as novels and other publications do for Star Wars canon: a \"second tier\" of canonicity, which is subservient to primary (on-screen) sources.\n\nOther sources such as books and computer games are not included as canonical, but are covered by Memory Alpha in a way which sets it apart from other \"Trek\" resources: books, comics, and other products are included as articles about the products (i.e. from a \"production point of view\"), but \"in-universe\" information unique or new to them is covered on the product page. For example, in the \"\" line of books, a new host of characters is introduced to the Trek universe, and their vessel is known as the USS \"Excalibur\". The characters, ships and information from \"New Frontier\" books do not receive pages of their own, but they are covered on the pages about the books. In this way, Memory Alpha remains all-inclusive while attempting to distinguish the canon from apocryphal material.\n\nNon-canonical characters and topics are instead covered at , and fan-films and other fan-created material at ; both are hosted by Wikia. The Star Trek Online Wiki, hosted by curse.com, covers the Star Trek Online MMORPG.\n\nSeveral issues face the Memory Alpha community, one of which is the question of which articles should be given \"featured\" status. Under Memory Alpha's current policies, both major and minor topics are eligible; however, the question has been raised of whether the criteria for featuring should be more subjective, i.e., if a topic is not significant enough, it should not be featured regardless of how comprehensive its article is. There is no consensus in the Memory Alpha community about the topic, although there has been no change in featuring policy.\n\nThe question of what content Memory Alpha should cover has plagued the project since its creation. On the project's home page, it describes itself as \"a collaborative project to create the most definitive, accurate, and accessible encyclopedia and reference for everything related to \"Star Trek\"\", but fans often have different interpretations of what \"everything\" means. Sometimes, one or more users may add content about a subject – such as a website, fan club or parody – that does not fit existing pages, necessitating a community decision about whether to keep the content and, if so, what to do with it. Such incidents led to the creation of an article on \"Star Trek\" parodies after several questions were raised about where to put information related to, but not a part of, the \"Star Trek\" franchise. An example of the reverse case is \"The Sunspots\", a musical group consisting of Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, LeVar Burton and Michael Dorn. Although the actors involved were all prominent parts of \"\", several articles on the group have been deleted because the community deemed the topic not directly related to the franchise. , information about The Sunspots can be found on the different actors' pages rather than a single, separate article.\n\nPerhaps the most heated issue on Memory Alpha in recent years is the controversy surrounding their canon policy. Aside from issues of length and excessive use of legalese, this policy has been put into question by several of the site's regular users because of its rule that articles and information which were not seen on-screen but were derived from official production sources are not considered canonical on Memory Alpha. The site's archivists are divided as to exactly whether such information should be allowed as canonical; some want only to allow what was seen on-screen while others wish to include that which was originally intended to be used on-screen but never made it, such as information from deleted scenes, early script drafts, etc. The latter archivists believe that such information can be included so long as it does not contradict what was seen on-screen and so long as it states where the source of the information comes from. , this debate has died down significantly, with most having accepted the terms of the new policy.\n\nDespite early concern about how to incorporate information from the 2009 movie \"Star Trek\", which is considered a semi-reboot of the original series, Memory Alpha members found a solution to the issue. All information from this film is recorded as separate articles, which are titled according to their subject with the term \"alternate reality\" included in the title. This is from the term used in the movie itself to describe the new continuity. For example, the article \"Nyota Uhura\" discusses the character as portrayed by Nichelle Nichols, while the article \"Nyota Uhura (alternate reality)\" discusses the character as played by Zoe Saldana.\n\nThe contents of Memory Alpha are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial (CC BY-NC) license.

{"id": "21304605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21304605", "title": "Nativism (politics)", "text": "Nativism (politics)\n\nNativism is the political policy of promoting the interests of native inhabitants against those of immigrants, including by supporting immigration-restriction measures.\n\nIn scholarly studies \"nativism\" is a standard technical term. Those who hold this political view, however, do not typically accept the label. Dindar (2009) wrote, \"nativists... do not consider themselves as nativists. For them it is a negative term and they rather consider themselves as 'Patriots'\".\n\nAccording to Fetzer (2000), opposition to immigration commonly arises in many countries because of issues of national, cultural, and religious identity. The phenomenon has been studied especially in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as in continental Europe. Thus nativism has become a general term for \"opposition to immigration\" based on fears that the immigrants will distort or spoil existing cultural values. In situations where immigrants greatly outnumber the original inhabitants, nativistic movements can allow cultural survival. The claim that immigrants can \"swamp\" a local population is related to birth rate relative to nationals. Contemporary opponents of immigration blame it for such problems as unemployment, crime (especially through gangs), harm to the environment, housing shortage, and overwhelming social services such as hospitals, police.\n\nImmigration restrictionist sentiment is typically justified with one or more of the following arguments and claims about immigrants:\n\nMany Australians opposed the influx of Chinese immigrants at time of the nineteenth-century gold rushes. When the separate Australian colonies formed the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the new nation adopted \"White Australia\" as one of its founding principles. Under the White Australia policy, entry of Chinese and other Asians remained controversial until well after World War II, although the country remained home to many long-established Chinese families dating from before the adoption of White Australia. By contrast, most Pacific Islanders were deported soon after the policy was adopted, while the remainder were forced out of the canefields where they had worked for decades.\n\nHostility of native-born white Australians toward British and Irish immigrants in the late 19th century was manifested in a new party, the Australian Natives' Association.\n\nSince early 2000, opposition has mounted to asylum seekers arriving in boats from Indonesia.\n\nThe Brazilian elite desired the racial whitening of the country, similarly to Argentina and Uruguay. The country encouraged European immigration, but non-white immigration always faced considerable backlash. On July 28, 1921, representatives Andrade Bezerra and Cincinato Braga proposed a law whose Article 1 provided: \"The immigration of individuals from the black race to Brazil is prohibited.\" On October 22, 1923, representative Fidélis Reis produced another bill on the entry of immigrants, whose fifth article was as follows: \"The entry of settlers from the black race into Brazil is prohibited. For Asian [immigrants] there will be allowed each year a number equal to 5% of those residing in the country.(...)\".\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, there were negative feelings toward the communities of German, Italian, Japanese, and Jewish immigrants, who conserved their language and culture instead of adopting Portuguese and Brazilian habit (so that nowadays Brazil has the biggest communities in the Americas of speakers of German and Venetian), were seen as particularly tendentious to form ghettos, had high rates of endogamy (in Brazil, it is regarded as usual for people of different backgrounds to miscegenate), among other concerns.\n\nIt affected more harshly the Japanese, because they were Asian, and thus seen as an obstacle of the whitening of Brazil. Oliveira Viana, a Brazilian jurist, historian and sociologist described the Japanese immigrants as follows: \"They (Japanese) are like sulfur: insoluble\". The Brazilian magazine \"O Malho\" in its edition of December 5, 1908 issued a charge of Japanese immigrants with the following legend: \"The government of São Paulo is stubborn. After the failure of the first Japanese immigration, it contracted 3,000 yellow people. It insists on giving Brazil a race diametrically opposite to ours\". In 1941, the Brazilian Minister of Justice, Francisco Campos, defended the ban on admission of 400 Japanese immigrants in São Paulo and wrote: \"their despicable standard of living is a brutal competition with the country's worker; their selfishness, their bad faith, their refractory character, make them a huge ethnic and cultural cyst located in the richest regions of Brazil\".\n\nSome years before World War II, the government of President Getúlio Vargas initiated a process of forced assimilation of people of immigrant origin in Brazil. The Constitution of 1934 had a legal provision about the subject: \"The concentration of immigrants anywhere in the country is prohibited; the law should govern the selection, location and assimilation of the alien\". The assimilationist project affected mainly German, Italian, Japanese and Jewish immigrants and their descendants.\n\nDuring World War II they were seen as more loyal to their countries of origin than to Brazil. In fact, there were violent revolts in the Japanese community of the states of São Paulo and Paraná when Emperor Hirohito declared that Japan surrendered and he was not a deity, which was thought as a conspiracy trying to hurt Japanese honor and strength. Nevertheless, it followed hostility from the government. The Japanese Brazilian community was strongly marked by restrictive measures when Brazil declared war against Japan in August 1942. Japanese Brazilians could not travel the country without safe conduct issued by the police; over 200 Japanese schools were closed and radio equipment was seized to prevent transmissions on short wave from Japan. The goods of Japanese companies were confiscated and several companies of Japanese origin had interventions, including the newly founded Banco América do Sul. Japanese Brazilians were prohibited from driving motor vehicles (even if they were taxi drivers), buses or trucks on their property. The drivers employed by Japanese had to have permission from the police. Thousands of Japanese immigrants were arrested or expelled from Brazil on suspicion of espionage. There were many anonymous denunciations because of \"activities against national security\" arising from disagreements between neighbours, recovery of debts and even fights between children. Japanese Brazilians were arrested for \"suspicious activity\" when they were in artistic meetings or picnics. On July 10, 1943, approximately 10,000 Japanese and German immigrants who lived in Santos had 24 hours to close their homes and businesses and move away from the Brazilian coast. The police acted without any notice. About 90% of people displaced were Japanese. To reside in Baixada Santista, the Japanese had to have a safe conduct. In 1942, the Japanese community who introduced the cultivation of pepper in Tomé-Açu, in Pará, was virtually turned into a \"concentration camp\" (expression of the time) from which no Japanese could leave. This time, the Brazilian ambassador in Washington, D.C., Carlos Martins Pereira e Sousa, encouraged the government of Brazil to transfer all the Japanese Brazilians to \"internment camps\" without the need for legal support, in the same manner as was done with the Japanese residents in the United States. No single suspicion of activities of Japanese against \"national security\" was confirmed.\n\nNowadays, nativism in Brazil affects primarily migrants from elsewhere in the Third World, such as the new wave of Levantine Arabs (this time, mostly Muslim from Palestine instead of overwhelmingly Christian from Syria and Lebanon), South and East Asians (primarily Mainland Chinese), Spanish-speakers and Amerindians from neighboring South American countries and, especially, West Africans and Haitians. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake and considerable illegal immigration to northern Brazil and São Paulo, a subsequent debate in the population was concerned with the reasons why Brazil has such lax laws and enforcement concerning illegal immigration.\n\nAccording to the 1988's Brazilian Constitution, it is an unbailable crime to address someone in an offensive racist way, and it is illegal to discriminate someone on the basis of his or her race, skin color, national or regional origin or nationality (for more, see anti-discrimination laws in Brazil), thus nativism and opposition to multiculturalism would be too much of a polemic and delicate topic to be openly discussed as a basic ideology of even the most right-leaning modern political parties.\n\nNativism was common in Canada (though the term originated in the U.S.). It took several forms. Hostility to the Chinese and other Asians was intense, and involved provincial laws that hindered immigration of Chinese and Japanese and blocked their economic mobility. In 1942 Japanese Canadians were forced into detention camps in response to Japanese aggression in World War II.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, well into the 20th, the Orange Order in Canada attacked and tried to politically defeat the Irish Catholics. The Ku Klux Klan spread in the mid-1920s from the U.S. to parts of Canada, especially Saskatchewan, where it helped topple the Liberal government. The Klan creed was, historian Martin Robin argues, in the mainstream of Protestant Canadian sentiment, for it was based on \"Protestantism, separation of Church and State, pure patriotism, restrictive and selective immigration, one national public school, one flag and one language—English.\"\n\nIn World War I, Canadian naturalized citizens of German or Austrian origins were stripped of their right to vote, and tens of thousands of Ukrainians (who were born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire) were rounded up and put in internment camps.\n\nHostility of native-born Canadians to competition from English immigrants in the early 20th century was expressed in signs that read, \"No English Need Apply!\" The resentment came because the immigrants identified more with England than with Canada.\n\nIn the British Empire, traditions of anti-Catholicism in Britain led to fears that Catholics were a threat to the national (British) values. In Canada, the Orange Order (of Irish Protestants) campaigned vigorously against the Catholics throughout the 19th century, often with violent confrontations. Both sides were immigrants from Ireland and neither side claimed loyalty to Canada. The Orange Order was much less influential in the U.S., especially after a major riot in New York City in 1871.\n\nNativism in Hong Kong is often used as a synonymy with localism, which strives for the autonomy of Hong Kong and resist China's authorities influence in the city. In addition to their strong anti-communist and pro-democracy tendency, It often holds a strong anti-mainland sentiments, especially the influx of the mainland tourists and immigrants, seeing them as a threat to Hong Kong identity and culture.\n\nFor the Poles in the mining districts of western Germany before 1914, it was nationalism (on both the German and the Polish sides), which kept Polish workers, who had established an associational structure approaching institutional completeness (churches, voluntary associations, press, even unions), separate from the host German society. Lucassen found that religiosity and nationalism were more fundamental in generating nativism and inter-group hostility than the labor antagonism.\n\nOnce Italian workers in France had understood the benefit of unionism and French unions were willing to overcome their fear of Italians as strikebreakers, integration was open for most Italian immigrants. The French state, which was always more of an immigration state than Prussia, Germany or Great Britain, fostered and supported family-based immigration and thus helped Italians on their immigration trajectory with minimal nativism.\n\nMany observers see the post-1950s wave of immigration in Europe was fundamentally different from the pre-1914 patterns. They debate the role of cultural differences, ghettos, race, Muslim fundamentalism, poor education and poverty play in creating nativism among the hosts and a caste-type underclass, more similar to white-black tensions in the US. Algerian migration to France has generated nativism, characterized by the prominence of Jean-Marie Le Pen and his National Front.\n\nThe Pakistani province of Sindh has seen nativist movements, promoting control for the Sindhi people over their homeland. After the 1947 Partition of India, large numbers of Muhajir people migrating from India entered the province, becoming a majority in the provincial capital city of Karachi, which formerly had an ethnically Sindhi majority. Sindhis have also voiced opposition to the promotion of Urdu, as opposed to their native tongue, Sindhi.\n\nThese nativist movements are expressed through Sindhi nationalism and the Sindhudesh separatist movement. Nativist and nationalist sentiments increased greatly after the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nNativism flourished in Taiwan in the 1970s as a reaction against the influx of mainland Chinese to the island after the Kuomintang's defeat in 1949. Nativists felt that the political influence of mainland Chinese was disproportionately large. The term is especially found in the field of literature, where nativist literature was more traditionally minded than the modernist literature written largely by mainland Chinese.\n\nLondon was notorious for its xenophobia in the 16th century, and conditions worsened in the 1580s. Many immigrants became disillusioned by routine threats of violence and molestation, attempts at expulsion of foreigners, and the great difficulty in acquiring English citizenship. Dutch cities proved more hospitable, and many left London permanently.\n\nRegarding the Irish in 20th-century Great Britain, Lucassen argues that the deep religious divide between the Protestants and Catholics was at the core of the ongoing estrangement of the Irish in British society.\n\nNativism was a political factor in the 1790s and in the 1830s-1850s. There was little nativism in the colonial era, but for a while Benjamin Franklin was hostile to German Americans in colonial Pennsylvania; He called them \"Palatine Boors.\" However, he reversed himself and became a supporter.\n\nNativism became a major issue in the late 1790s, when the Federalist Party expressed its strong opposition to the French Revolution by trying to strictly limit immigration, and stretching the time to 14 years for citizenship. At the time of the Quasi-War with France in 1798, the Federalists and Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, including the Alien Act, the Naturalization Act and the Sedition Act. The movement was led by Alexander Hamilton, despite his own status as an immigrant from a small Island. Phillip Magness argues that “Hamilton’s political career might legitimately be characterized as a sustained drift into nationalistic xenophobia.” Thomas Jefferson and James Madison fought by drafting the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions. The two laws against aliens were motivated by fears of a growing Irish radical presence in Philadelphia, where they supported Jefferson. However, they were not actually enforced. President John Adams annoyed his fellow Federalists by making peace with France, and splitting his party in 1800. Jefferson was elected president, and reversed most of the hostile legislation.\n\nThe term \"nativism\" was first used by 1844: \"Thousands were Naturalized expressly to oppose Nativism, and voted the Polk ticket mainly to that end.\"\n\nNativism gained its name from the \"Native American\" parties of the 1840s and 1850s. In this context \"Native\" does not mean indigenous Americans or American Indians but rather those descended from the inhabitants of the original Thirteen Colonies. It impacted politics in the mid-19th century because of the large inflows of immigrants after 1845 from cultures that were different from the existing American culture. Nativists objected primarily to Irish Roman Catholics because of their loyalty to the Pope and also because of their supposed rejection of republicanism as an American ideal.\n\nNativist movements included the Know Nothing or American Party of the 1850s, the Immigration Restriction League of the 1890s, the anti-Asian movements in the West, resulting in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the \"Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907\" by which Japan's government stopped emigration to the United States. Labor unions were strong supporters of Chinese exclusion and limits on immigration, because of fears that they would lower wages and make it harder for workers to organize unions.\n\nHistorian Eric Kaufmann has suggested that American nativism has been explained primarily in psychological and economic terms due to the neglect of a crucial cultural and ethnic dimension. Furthermore, Kauffman claims that American nativism cannot be understood without reference to an American ethnic group which took shape prior to the large-scale immigration of the mid-eighteenth century.\nNativist outbursts occurred in the Northeast from the 1830s to the 1850s, primarily in response to a surge of Irish Catholic immigration. In 1836, Samuel Morse ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York City on a Nativist ticket, receiving 1,496 votes. In New York City, an Order of United Americans was founded as a nativist fraternity, following the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of the preceding spring and summer, in December, 1844.\n\nThe Nativists went public in 1854 when they formed the 'American Party', which was especially hostile to the immigration of Irish Catholics and campaigned for laws to require longer wait time between immigration and naturalization. (The laws never passed.) It was at this time that the term \"nativist\" first appears, opponents denounced them as \"bigoted nativists.\" Former President Millard Fillmore ran on the American Party ticket for the Presidency in 1856. The American Party also included many ex-Whigs who ignored nativism, and included (in the South) a few Catholics whose families had long lived in America. Conversely, much of the opposition to Catholics came from Protestant Irish immigrants and German Lutheran immigrants who were not native at all and can hardly be called \"nativists.\"\n\nThis form of nationalism is often identified with xenophobia and anti-Catholic sentiment (anti-Papism). In Charlestown, Massachusetts, a nativist mob attacked and burned down a Catholic convent in 1834 (no one was injured). In the 1840s, small scale riots between Catholics and nativists took place in several American cities. In Philadelphia in 1844, for example, a series of nativist assaults on Catholic churches and community centers resulted in the loss of lives and the professionalization of the police force. In Louisville, Kentucky, election-day rioters killed at least 22 people in attacks on German and Irish Catholics on Aug. 6, 1855, in what became known as \"Bloody Monday.\"\n\nThe new Republican Party kept its nativist element quiet during the 1860s, since immigrants were urgently needed for the Union Army. Immigrants from England, Scotland and Scandinavia favored the Republicans during the Third Party System, 1854-1896, while others were usually Democratic. Hostility toward Asians was very strong from the 1860s to the 1940s. Nativism experienced a revival in the 1890s, led by Protestant Irish immigrants hostile to Catholic immigration, especially the American Protective Association.\n\nFrom the 1840s to 1920 German Americans were distrusted because of their separatist social structure, their German-language schools, their attachment to their native tongue over English, and their neutrality during World War I.\n\nThe Bennett Law caused a political uproar in Wisconsin in 1890, as the state government passed a law that threatened to close down hundreds of German-language elementary schools. Catholic and Lutheran Germans rallied to defeat Governor William D. Hoard. Hoard attacked German American culture and religion:\nHoard, a Republican, was defeated by the Democrats. A similar campaign in Illinois regarding the \"Edwards Law\" led to a Republican defeat there in 1890.\n\nIn 1917–1918, a wave of nativist sentiment led to the suppression of German cultural activities in the United States, Canada and Australia. There was little violence, but many places and streets had their names changed (The city of \"Berlin\" in Ontario was renamed \"Kitchener\" after a British hero), churches switched to English for their services, and German Americans were forced to buy war bonds to show their patriotism. In Australia thousands of Germans were put into internment camps.\n\nIn the 1870s in the western states Irish Americans targeted violence against Chinese workers, driving them out of smaller towns. Denis Kearney, an immigrant from Ireland, led a mass movement in San Francisco in the 1870s that incited attacks on the Chinese there and threatened public officials and railroad owners. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first of many nativist acts of Congress which attempted to limit the flow of immigrants into the U.S.. The Chinese responded to it by filing false claims of American birth, enabling thousands of them to immigrate to California. The exclusion of the Chinese caused the western railroads to begin importing Mexican railroad workers in greater numbers (\"traqueros\").\n\nIn the 1890s–1920s era nativists and labor unions campaigned for immigration restriction. A favorite plan was the literacy test to exclude workers who could not read or write their own foreign language. Congress passed literacy tests, but presidents—responding to business needs for workers—vetoed them. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge argued need for literacy tests and its implication on the new immigrants:\n\nResponding to these demands, opponents of the literacy test called for the establishment of an immigration commission to focus on immigration as a whole. The United States Immigration Commission, also known as the Dillingham Commission, was created and tasked with studying immigration and its effect on the United States. The findings of the commission further influenced immigration policy and upheld the concerns of the nativist movement.\n\nFollowing World War I, nativists in the twenties focused their attention on Catholics, Jews, and south-eastern Europeans and realigned their beliefs behind racial and religious nativism. The racial concern of the anti-immigration movement was linked closely to the eugenics movement that was sweeping the United States in the twenties. Led by Madison Grant's book, \"The Passing of the Great Race\" nativists grew more concerned with the racial purity of the United States. In his book, Grant argued that the American racial stock was being diluted by the influx of new immigrants from the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and the ghettos. \"The Passing of the Great Race\" reached wide popularity among Americans and influenced immigration policy in the twenties.\nIn the 1920s a wide national consensus sharply restricted the overall inflow of immigrants, especially those from southern and eastern Europe. The second Ku Klux Klan, which flourished in the U.S. in the 1920s, used strong nativist rhetoric, but the Catholics led a counterattack.\n\nAfter intense lobbying from the nativist movement the United States Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921. This bill was the first to place numerical quotas on immigration. It capped the inflow of immigrations to 357,803 for those arriving outside of the western hemisphere. However, this bill was only temporary as Congress began debating a more permanent bill.\n\nThe Emergency Quota Act was followed with the Immigration Act of 1924, a more permanent resolution. This law reduced the number of immigrants able to arrive from 357,803, the number established in the Emergency Quota Act, to 164,687. Though this bill did not fully restrict immigration, it considerably curbed the flow of immigration into the United States, especially from Southern and Eastern Europe. During the late twenties an average of 270,000 immigrants were allowed to arrive mainly because of the exemption of Canada and Latin American countries.\n\nFear of low-skilled immigrants flooding the labor market was an issue in the 1920s (focused on immigrants from Italy and Poland), and in the first decade of the 21st century (focused on immigrants from Mexico and Central America).\n\nAn immigration reductionism movement formed in the 1970s and continues to the present day. Prominent members often press for massive, sometimes total, reductions in immigration levels.\n\nAmerican nativist sentiment experienced a resurgence in the late 20th century, this time directed at undocumented workers, largely Mexican resulting in the passage of new penalties against illegal immigration in 1996.\n\nMost immigration reductionists see Illegal immigration, principally from across the United States–Mexico border, as the more pressing concern. Authors such as Samuel Huntington have also seen recent Hispanic immigration as creating a national identity crisis and presenting insurmountable problems for US social institutions.\n\nNoting the large-scale Mexican immigration in the Southwest, the Cold-war diplomat George F. Kennan in 2002 saw \"unmistakable evidences of a growing differentiation between the cultures, respectively, of large southern and southwestern regions of this country, on the one hand\", and those of \"some northern regions\". In the former, he warned:\n\nMayers argues that Kennan represented the \"tradition of militant nativism\" that resembled or even exceeded the Know Nothings of the 1850s. Mayers adds that Kennan also believed American women had too much power.\n\nBy late 2014, the \"Tea Party movement\" had turned its focus away from economic issues, spending, and Obamacare, and towards President Barack Obama's immigration policies, which it saw as threatening to transform American society. It planned to defeat leading Republicans who supported immigration programs, such as Senator John McCain. A typical slogan appeared in the \"Tea Party Tribune\": “Amnesty for Millions, Tyranny for All.” The \"New York Times\" reported:\n\nIn his 2016 bid for presidency, Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump has been accused of introducing nativist themes for his controversial stances on temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the United States and erecting a substantial wall between the US-Mexico border to halt illegal immigration. Journalist John Cassidy wrote in \"The New Yorker\" Trump is transforming the GOP into a populist, nativist party:\n\nDonald Brand, a professor of political science, argues:\n\nAmerican nativists have promoted English and deprecated the use of German and Spanish. English Only proponents in the late 20th century proposed an English Language Amendment (ELA), a Constitutional Amendment making English the official language of the United States, but it received limited political support.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1523842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1523842", "title": "Proclamation", "text": "Proclamation\n\nA proclamation (Lat. \"proclamare\", to make public by announcement) is an official declaration issued by a person of authority to make certain announcements known. Proclamations are currently used within the governing framework of some nations and are usually issued in the name of the head of state. \n\nIn English law, a proclamation is a formal announcement (\"royal proclamation\"), made under the great seal, of some matter which the King in Council or Queen in Council desires to make known to his or her subjects: \"e.g.\", the declaration of war, or state of emergency, the statement of neutrality, the summoning or dissolution of Parliament, or the bringing into operation of the provisions of some statute the enforcement of which the legislature has left to the discretion of the king or queen in the announcement. Proclamations are also used for declaring bank holidays and the issuance of coinage.\n\nRoyal proclamations of this character, made in furtherance of the executive power of the Crown, are binding on the subject, \"where they do not either contradict the old laws or tend to establish new ones, but only confine the execution of such laws as are already in being in such matter as the sovereign shall judge necessary\" (Blackstone's Commentaries, ed. Stephen, ii. 528; Stephen's Commentaries, 14th ed. 1903, ii. 506, 507; Dicey, Law of the Constitution, 6th ed., 51). Royal proclamations, which, although not made in pursuance of the executive powers of the Crown, either call upon the subject to fulfil some duty which they are by law bound to perform, or to abstain from any acts or conduct already prohibited by law, are lawful and right, and disobedience to them (while not of itself a misdemeanour) is an aggravation of the offence (see charge of Chief Justice Cockburn to the grand jury in R. v. Eyre (1867) and Case of Proclamations 1610, 12 Co. Rep. 74.\n\nThe Crown has from time to time legislated by proclamation; and the Statute of Proclamations 1539 provided that proclamations made by the king with the assent of the council should have the force of statute law if they were not prejudicial to \"any person's inheritance, offices, liberties, goods, chattels or life.\" But this enactment was repealed by an act of 1547; and it is certain that a proclamation purporting to be made in the exercise of legislative power by which the sovereign imposes a duty to which the subject is not by law liable, or prohibits under penalties what is not an offence at law, or adds fresh penalties to any offence, is of no effect unless itself issued in virtue of statutory authority (see also Order in Council).\n\nThe Crown has power to legislate by proclamation for a newly conquered country (Jenkyns, \"British Rule and Jurisdiction beyond the Seas\"); and this power was freely exercised in North America following the Seven Years' War by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and in the Transvaal Colony during the Second Boer War 1899–1902. In the British colonies, ordinances are frequently brought into force by proclamation; certain imperial acts do not take effect in a colony until they are proclaimed (e.g. the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870); and proclamations are constantly issued in furtherance of executive acts. In many British protectorates the high commissioner or administrator was empowered to legislate by proclamation.\n\nIn the old system of real property law in England, fines, levied with \"proclamations\", \"i.e.\", with successive public announcements of the transaction in open court, barred the rights of strangers, as well as parties, in case they had not made claim to the property conveyed within five years thereafter (acts 1483–1484 and 1488–1489). These proclamations were originally made sixteen times, four times in the term in which the fine was levied, and four times in each of the three succeeding terms. Afterwards the number of proclamations was reduced to one in each of the four terms. The proclamations were endorsed on the back of the record. The system was abolished by the Fines and Recoveries Act 1833.\n\nOn certain rare occasions, the heralds of the College of Arms and the Lyon Court (or somebody else assigned to) still publicly read out certain proclamations such as the proclamation regarding the dissolution of parliament or proclamations regarding the monarch's coronation, where they are read at the steps of the Royal Exchange in London and at the Mercat Cross in Edinburgh.\n\nPresidential proclamations are policy announcements issued by the President of the United States of America.\n\n\n"}

If the customer is paying by cheque, the remittance advice often accompanies the cheque. The advice may consist of a literal letter (e.g., \"Gentlemen: Your shipment of the 10th inst was received in good order; accompanying is our remittance of $52.47 per invoice No 83046\") or of a voucher attached to the side or top of the cheque.\n\nRemittance advices are not mandatory, however they are seen as a courtesy because they help the accounts-receivable department to match invoices with payments. The remittance advice should therefore specify the invoice numbers for which payment is tendered. \n\nIn countries where cheques are still used, most companies' invoices are designed so that customers return a portion of the invoice, called a remittance advice, with their payment. In countries where wire transfer is the predominant payment method, invoices are commonly accompanied by standardised bank transfer order forms (like \"s\" (Netherlands) and \"en\" (German)) which include a field into which the invoice or client number can be encoded, usually in a computer-readable way. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at, or mails it to, his bank, which will then transfer the money.\n\nThe employee who opens the incoming mail should initially compare the amount of cash received with the amount shown on the remittance advice. If the customer does not return a remittance advice, an employee prepares one. Like the cash register tape, the remittance advice serves as a record of cash initially received.\n\nModern systems will often scan a paper remittance advice into a computer system where data entry will be performed. Modern remittance advises can include dozens, or hundreds of invoice numbers, and other information.\n\nRemittance advises (RAs) can be very complicated, especially in specialized fields like medical insurance payments.\n\n"}

He dabbled in voice (a baritone), and following the cultural tendencies of the high-bourgeois of the nineteenth century to furnish private libraries with music to be played in their private salons, he acquired and commissioned various musical pieces (above all songs) to animate the ordinary evenings in his palaces (that of via Ripa del Sale in Pistoia, and the villas of Candeglia in Spicchio and in Gello).\n\nHe also collected numerous librettos, single arias and complete works for voice and pianoforte, drawn from the performances of the Teatro dei Risvegliati, to which he was a member. His musical possessions were greatly amplified when he integrated his immense patrimony of his family, who became one of the most extravagant patrons of Pistoia from 1635 and on. The remarkable collection, kept organized (three accurate inventories composed by Giovan Carlo exist), remained the property of the descendents of the Rospigliosi family until the 1970s when the priest from Pistoia, Umberto Pineschi, convinced Clemente Rospigliosi to donate the most antique pages to the Archive of the Chapter. The same Clemente, in 1982, decided to donate the rest of the collection to the Town of Pistoia, where it is preserved still today in the Forteguerriana Library.\n\nIn all, the collection consists of 4668 units: 4116 are at the Forteguerriana, 552 are at the Archive of the Chapter. The oldest objects, manuscripts, come about because of the patronage of the Rospilgliosi Family, with a great deal of music by the composers that were active in Pistoia, Pisa and Florence in the 1700s (for example Giovan Gualberto Brunetti, Charles-Antoine Campion, Giuseppe Gherardeschi, Christian Joseph Lidarti) as well as at the national level (such as Giovanni Battista Sammartini, Niccolò Jommelli and Giuseppe Farinelli). Most of these are conserved today in the Archive of the Chapter because of their sacred nature.\nThe Forteguerriana Library, however, hosts the manuscript of \"Ercole in Tebe\" by Jacopo Melani in 1661 of theatrical origin. The core of the collection is based on the acquisitions in the 1800s by Giovan Carlo, and is made up of: some arias composed for him by the local songwriter Raffaello Bertini (of which the Forteguerriana Library conserves the handwritten copies), numerous opera librettos (of almost all of the authors found in Pistoia from 1868 to 1902, from Rossini to Mabellini, from Mercadante to Massenet, from Pacini to Gounod, from Meyerbeer to Bellini, from Donizetti to Bizet, from Auber to Verdi, to whom he shares a strong spirit for the Risorgimento), printed editions of arias for voice (suitable for his own range of baritone, but also for other voice types) inspired by miscellaneous and contemporary collections and often with piano accompaniment (librettos and songs are at the Forteguerriana), publications regarding musical topics (today at the Archive of the Chapter), such as publications by the theorists of the 1800s and 1900s (Abramo Basevi, Riccardo Gandolfi) as well as letters and other writings by composers (for example letters by Bellini in an edition dated 1882, and the artistic memories of Pacini printed from 1865 to 1872).\n\n"}

City directories are an important resource for historical research, allowing individual addresses and occupations to be linked to specific streets and suburbs.\n\nJohn Sands (1818-1873) was an engraver, printer and stationer. Born in England he moved to Sydney in 1837. Sands formed several business partnerships, in 1851 with his brother-in-law Thomas Kenny, and in 1860 with Dugald McDougall with the business being known as Sands, Kenny & Co. Directory titles changed as the publisher changed partners, and at different points the Sands Directories were also published as the 'Sands and Kenny' or 'Sands and McDougall Directories'.\n\nThe first Melbourne Directory was published by Sands and Kenny in 1857. By 1858 the second edition of the directory was distributed to public libraries in the major seaports of Great Britain, Ireland, the United States of America, and Canada. From 1862 to 1974 the Melbourne directories were published as the Sands and McDougall Melbourne Directory.\n\nThe 1860 Melbourne directory was 400 pages long and contained over 10,000 entries.\n\nThe \"Sands Sydney, Suburban and Country Commercial Directory\", first published in 1858, included a variety of information including street addresses and businesses, farms and country towns, stock numbers (e.g. horses, cattle and sheep on each station) as well as information about public watering places including dams, tanks and wells. With the primary function of post office directory it provides lists of householders, businesses, public institutions and officials.\n\nThe Sydney editions of the directory, covering the state of New South Wales, were published each year from 1858–59 to 1932–33. There were four years when the directory did not appear during this time, they were 1872, 1874, 1878 and 1881. The directory is arranged by municipalities in which properties were located, listing the primary householder street by street. As a consequence, the household and business information in the directories is used for research into Sydney history, with particular application for genealogical research.\n\nBy 1909 the Sydney directory contained over 1700 pages. The full title of the 1913 edition of the directory of Sydney is \"Sands Sydney, Suburban and Country Directory for 1913 comprising, amongst other information, street, alphabetical, trade and professional, country towns, country alphabetical, pastoral, educational, governmental, parliamentary, law and miscellaneous lists\".\n\nSands and McDougall arrived in Adelaide in 1883. They took over the directory previously published by Josiah Boothby, publishing their first South Australian directory in January 1884. The Sands & McDougall's Directory of South Australia was published from 1884 to 1974.\n\n\n"}

Actually this huge volume which grew up to 1800-1900 pages has always provided more, including surveys on the city economy, extracts from the legislative acts, lists of the post offices through the entire Russia, if not to mention thousands of commercial advertisings.\n\nA point of special interest was the historic and statistical city digest in V. I. Pokrovsky's feature article, published in the Ves Peterburg in 1901 and 1903). \n\nFrom 1910-ths the editors of the directory aimed at the gradual expansion of the territorial coverage of their edition. Starting with the closest suburbs, by 1917 they included the information and maps related to the largest cities of the Petrograd gubernia. After the soviets resumed the publication of the city directory, they continued this expansion, covering more and more cities of the Leningrad oblast, up to Luga and Gdov.\n\nUntil 1917, while the city was the capital of the Russian empire, 'Ves Petrograd' provided its readers with the comprehensive information upon the ministries and the councils, the royal establishments and the State Duma. The movement of the capital of the Soviet Russia from Petrograd to Moscow in 1918 coinsided with the 4-year suspension of the directory (1918-1921).\n\nSince 1922 when the city authorities of Petrograd resumed the publication of the directory, it continued the institutional section of the directory, now revealing the new structure of the municipal (soviets), party committees, professional unions and other social organizations.\n\nIn different periods the relevant information was either included in the first, 'governmental' section, or was concentrated in trhe separate section of the directory. It's noteworthy to mention, that since the very first editions of the Soviet period, 'Ves Leningrad' has been publishing the list of cathedrals and churches, which were taken under the state protection, as the cultural monuments. From 1920-ies the directories contain a lot information on people education, which help historians to trace its development from the likbez schools for illiterate to many hundreds of schools and tens of universities opened by the end of the First Five-year plan (1927-1932) and later.\n\nThe entries of this section are usually repeated in two subsections, alphabetic by name and by the branch of industry. Alongside with thousands of separate commercial advertisings, it provides economic historians with the valuable source of raw data. Beyond that, the directory published the special surveys on the city economy, including the turnover of the international trade, where Leningrad played the main role, as the largest port in the USSR.\n\nThose who imagine the Leningrad as the core of the strict government-run economy shall be surprised to see tens, if not hundreds of small collectively owned guilds (artel ) and cooperatives which continued to function in Leningrad many years after the NEP (the 'new economic policy') was suspended in favour of the 5-year planning.\n\nThe personal lists of practitioners in medicine and advocacy are the characteristic feature of the epoch before second world war. One should not be surprised to find hundreds of private lawyers, dentists and even obstetricians in Petrograd and Leningrad, for the soviet economy has never been totally government-run.\n\nThis is a very important section for the directory of the city like Leningrad, counting 2-3 million residents. The special section of the directory not only lists all the streets in alphabetic order, but also informs, what house numbers are on the odd and even sides between the crossing streets. If necessary, special maps are provided for the longest streets and prospects. Alongside with the house numbers the directory informs about the jurisdiction of the relevant city blocks, the closest post offices etc.\n\nAmateur researchers often fall into error, mussing up the ownership of the real estates with the personal residential addresses, however the professional historians extract deeper information, differing between the owners and the managers. However, 70% and more of the pre-revolutionary residents of Petrograd, mainly industrial workers remained outside the directory, since they were economically forced to hire separate rooms, and even the corners of rooms, offered to them by the wholesale profiteers in hiring dwellings. Also, even in the middle class families only the heads of households were listed in the directory, while their spouses and minors were omitted.\n\nAnyway, the curious scrollers may be excided to find online not only the addresses, but also the home telephone numbers of Matilda Kshesinskaya (#414), Aleksandr Kerensky (#11-960) on the pages of 'Ves Peterburg', as well as of Grigory Zinoviev (#127-61) on the pages of 'Ves Leningrad'.\n\nIn 1970s Leningrad became the top-ranking city of the world by the length of city tram lines and the total number of tram routes. From the directory of 1908, after the first lines of tram were opened (September, 1907), the directory provided the detailed information on each of these routes, including the streets, the tram stops, the fares, and what is not less important, the specific combination of colored identification lights which were set for each tram route.\n\nThe last directory of 'Ves Leningrad' was published in 1935. In the subsequent years the edition was replaced with abridged version (1939 and 1940) where all personal data (residency / domicile, phone numbers) was excluded.\n\nSuvorin also published city directories for Moscow under the title \"Vsia Moskva\" (All Moscow) for the years 1875 to 1936 and for the whole country under the titles \"Vsia Rossiia\" (All Russia) continued under than name \"Ves SSSR\" (All USSR) from 1924 to 1931.\n\nSince 1993 the private publishing House Presskom launched the annual telephone directory project under the title 'Ves Petersburg', however it is radically and conceptually different from its historical predecessor, and does not list residents at all.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a son of William George Thiselton-Dyer, physician and Catherine Jane, née Firminger, botanist. He was educated at King's College School where he was first mathematical scholar, and later proceeded to the medical department of King's College London, where he remained until 1863 when he proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford. Initially studying mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford, he graduated in natural science in 1867. He became Professor of Natural History at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester and then Professor of Botany at the Royal College of Science for Ireland in Dublin. In 1872, he became professor at the Royal Horticultural Society in London, being recommended by Joseph Dalton Hooker.\n\nThen in 1875, Thiselton-Dyer was appointed Assistant Director at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, under Hooker, where he was to stay for thirty years. Thiselton-Dyer spent considerable time working for the benefit of the British colonies. He introduced rubber plantations to Sri Lanka and Malaya, and introduced cacao from Trinidad to plantations in Sri Lanka. In 1877, he was given charge of an international research laboratory, established at Kew with private funding, which became known as one of the best laboratories in Europe. Thiselton-Dyer also designed a new rock garden, after a bequest to Kew in 1881 of a large collection of Alpine plants.\n\nThiselton-Dyer was elected FRS in 1880. His proposers included Charles Darwin and George Bentham, but not Joseph Dalton Hooker, whose daughter Dyer had already married. From 1885 to 1905, after the retirement of Hooker, he was director of the Royal Botanic Gardens.\n\nThiselton-Dyer was a fellow of the University of London from 1887 to 1890, Royal Commissioner to the Paris International Exhibition (1900) and to the St. Louis Exposition (1904), botanical adviser to the Secretary of State for the Colonies (1902–1906), and became a member of the court of the University of Bristol in 1909. His principal works are an English edition of Sachs \"Text-Book of Botany\" (1875), editions of the \"Flora Capensis\" and of the \"Flora of Tropical Africa\", and \"Index Kewensis\" (1905). \nWith his former school-friend Henry Trimen he published \"The Flora of Middlesex\" (1869).\n\nHe married the botanical illustrator Harriet Anne Hooker, daughter of Joseph Dalton Hooker, in 1877; they had one son and one daughter. She lived at Kew from birth until old age, surviving her husband and dying in 1946 aged 91, in her house near Bere Alston. Thiselton-Dyer was appointed in 1899, and awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1892. He died at The Ferns (now Crickley Court), Witcombe, a village near Gloucester, and is buried in the churchyard of St Peter's, Bentham.\n\n\n"}
