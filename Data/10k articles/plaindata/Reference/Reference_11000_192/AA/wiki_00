He was the founder of both the Nordic Museum (\"Nordiska museet\") and the Skansen open-air museum in Stockholm.\n\nHazelius was born in Stockholm, Sweden as the son of Johan August Hazelius (1797-1871), an Army officer (with terminal rank of major general), politician and publicist. He entered Uppsala University in 1854, and received his Ph.D. degree in 1860, after which he worked as a teacher, as well as participating in several school-book and language reform projects.\n\nIn 1869 Artur Hazelius was the secretary of the Swedish section at the Scandinavian orthographic congress in Stockholm (\"det nordiska rättstavningsmötet\"), and published its proceedings in 1871. The radical reforms in Swedish spelling proposed there sparked opposition from the Swedish Academy. This gave Johan Erik Rydqvist (1800–1877) the energy to publish \"Svenska Akademiens Ordlista\" (SAOL), the very conservative 1st edition of the Academy's one volume spelling dictionary in 1874. However, many of the proposals from the congress were introduced in the 6th edition of the same dictionary in 1889 (e-ä, qv-kv) and the rest (dt, fv, hv) in a spelling reform for Swedish schools, introduced in 1906 by the minister of education Fridtjuv Berg (1851–1916). Berg acknowledged that Hazelius had laid the foundation for all following spelling reforms.\n\nDuring travels in the country, Hazelius noticed how Swedish folk culture, including architecture and other aspects of the material culture, was eroding under the influence of industrialization, migration and other processes of modernity, and in 1872 he decided to establish a museum for Swedish ethnography, originally (1873) called the Scandinavian ethnographic collection (\"Skandinavisk-etnografiska samlingen\"), from 1880 the Nordic Museum (\"Nordiska Museum\", now \"Nordiska museet\"). In 1891 he established the open-air museum Skansen, which became the model for other open-air museums in Northern Europe. He got the idea after a visit to the world's first open-air museum, Norsk Folkemuseum established near Oslo in 1881.\n\nFor the Nordic museum, Hazelius bought or managed to get donations of objects – furniture, clothes, toys etc. – from all over Sweden and the other Nordic countries; he was mainly interested in peasant culture but his successors increasingly started to collect objects reflecting bourgeois and urban lifestyles as well. For Skansen he collected entire buildings and farms.\n\nAlthough the project did not initially get the government funding he had hoped, Hazelius received widespread support and donations, and by 1898 the Society for the promotion of the Nordic Museum (\"Samfundet för Nordiska Museets främjande\") had 4,525 members. The Riksdag, allocated some money for the museums in 1891 and doubled the amount in 1900, the year before his death. \nHazelius was married to Sofia Elisabeth Grafström (1839-1874), daughter of Anders Abraham Grafström, a historian, priest and member of the Swedish Academy. \nDuring the last few years of his life, Hazelius lived at Hazeliushuset, one of the old buildings on Skansen. He died on the 27 of May 1901, and on 4 February 1902, he was interred in a grave at Skansen.\n\nHis only son Gunnar Hazelius (1874-1905) succeeded him as curator of the Nordic Museum. Gunnar Hazelius's daughter Gunnel Hazelius-Berg (1905-1997) was later costume and textile historian at the Nordic Museum. Her husband, Professor Gösta Berg (1903-1993) served as director of the Nordic Museum and Skansen from 1956-1963 and managing director of the Skansen Foundation from 1964.\n\n"}

The process is similar to that used in beer judging competitions, such as those organised by the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) in America, though the participants are consumers so it may be termed a score-rated recommendation system. The rating system may be a simple 5 marks, and may be organized by a beer store or pub chain such as Wetherspoons in the UK; or it may be more involved, such as the systems used by beer rating websites such as BeerAdvocate and RateBeer. In one study it is claimed that beer ratings can be generally considered to be informative and unbiased source of information. \n\nBeerAdvocate is an online beer rating site which also rates bars and beer stores. It was founded in 1996, by brothers Todd and Jason Alström, and is based in Boston, Massachusetts, and Denver, Colorado, USA.\n\nAs of November 2013, BeerAdvocate's database contained about 3,783,570 ratings of about 100,976 beers.\n\nRateBeer was founded in May 2000 by Bill Buchanan as a forum for beer drinkers to exchange information and share opinions of beer. In June 2000, the Canadian beer writer Josh Oakes joined RateBeer and eventually became editor-in-chief. In June 2001, the web-site consultant Joe Tucker joined, eventually assuming full ownership of RateBeer.\n\nIn August 2006, RateBeer's annual press-release of the highest rated beers on the site caused concern when various world media reported that supplies of Westvleteren 12 were sold out due to being listed as the \"Best beer in the world\" on the site.\n\nRateBeer has over 4.5 million ratings (as of early 2013) of more than 470,000 beers, from over 26,000 breweries.\n\nIn June 2017, it was revealed that Anheuser-Busch InBev had acquired a minority stake in RateBeer via the incubator ZX Ventures. This purchase led to concerns that the company had a conflict of interest, citing that the site could present bias towards Anheuser-Busch InBev brands, that there was a lack of transparency over the role of the company's investment, and that it could potentially gain access to customer data. Several breweries attempted to demand that their listings be removed from the website. Executive director Joe Tucker stated that \"Nothing about this investment changes who we are and what we provide. We will just be able to give our community of beer drinkers an even better experience\".\n\nThe Oxford Bottled Beer Database was founded in 1992 by Sparks Computer Solutions Ltd, and contains reviews and ratings from site users. The site has ratings from all over the world, though mainly concentrates on Europe.\n\n"}

Housed inside the office building of Indy Pride, Inc., the collection currently has over 8,000 titles, a vast archive of local and national LGBT publications, including \"The Mirror Magazine\", \"The Works Magazine\" and the \"Heartland Newspaper\" collections. The library is also the proud recipient of the popular Bob and Margaret Green drag scene video collection. Other notable items in the archive is a collection of more than 200 T-shirts from legions of GBLT festivals and parades across the United States, valuable artwork by local artists, LGBT paraphernalia, mementos, and rare GLBT collectibles.\n\nThe brainchild of Michael Bohr, a lifelong resident of Indianapolis and graduate of Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School, 1966 and Xavier University, 1970, started the archive in 1993 with the donation of his personal collection, which contained 1,600 books and other memorabilia of gay life in Indianapolis. During the 1980s and 1990s, Acquired Immune Dificiency Syndrome (AIDS) took the lives of many friends of Bohr's, and, thus, served as a catalyst in the creation of the library. Additionally, Bohr's awareness of other GLBT libraries, particularly the Gerber/Hart Library in Chicago served as inspiration in establishing a library in his hometown of Indianapolis.\n\nFrom the beginning, Bohr’s inclination was to collect and preserve the history of gay life in Indianapolis. Thus, by erecting the \"Chris Gonzalez Library and Archives\", it became the place that espouses and commemorates the lives of same gender loving people and a repository of GLBT titles and memorabilia for generations to come. Gay and lesbian publications like \"The Mirror\", \"The Works\" and \"The Screamer\", which is believed to be the city's earliest gay publication serve as examples. \"The Screamer\" was published on mimeographed paper in 1966 and its writers worked undercover by using pseudonyms.\n\n\"The Chris Gonzalez Library and Archives\" became a reality in March 1995, in collaboration with \"Diversity, Inc.\", a now defunct LGBT community center in Indianapolis. While Diversity's focus was on the future, serving as a public identified central clearinghouse for people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender, the library's role was to keep a shining light on the past. Between 1997 and 2007, the library went through several changes and a few different sponsors. Indeed, with no other alternatives, the collection was placed in storage for approximately a year. However, Bohr continued seeking additional collections and some were simply donated by people in the community.\n\nIn April 2008, Indy Pride, Inc. forged a relationship with \"The Chris Gonzalez Library and Archives\" and became its sole benefactor. Indy Pride, Inc. is a community-based, non-profit organization that seeks to \"celebrate and educate others about the rich historical and cultural legacy of gay, bisexual and transgender peoples.\"\n\n\"The Chris Gonzalez Library and Archives\" was named for Christopher T. Gonzalez, a local supporter and activist of gay and lesbian youth in Indiana. He is credited with establishing the Indiana Youth Group, an award-winning, non-profit organization that caters to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth. He succumbed to AIDS in April, 1994.\n\n\n"}

The moniker is a modern designation as it had no colophon to identify it in antiquity.\n\nIt is known from a single fragmentary Seleucid era copy, now held in the British Museum with reference BM 48498 (81-11-3, 1209) where only the left-hand side (6.5 x 3 cm) of a medium sized tablet remains. The surface is heavily worn, especially on the reverse, and the bottom is also broken off, consequently leaving a gap in the middle of the narrative. The text is subdivided into sections of uneven length apparently devoted to different reigns and ends halfway down the reverse.\n\nProviding a brief résumé of commodity prices from sometime prior to the reign of Ḫammu-rapī (\"ana tar-ṣi Am-mu-ra-pí\", c. 1728–1686 BC, short chronology) until a period possibly as late as Nabû-šuma-iškun (c. 748 BC), it seems to have been compiled as a prologue to the pricing quoted in the Babylonian astronomical diaries, which seem to have begun immediately after this period, as it shares their phraseology. Other kings whose names are discernible include Kurigalzu I or II, the \"twenty-first year\" of Marduk-apla-iddina I or II (neither king reigned that long, unless Marduk-apla-iddina II's eight-year interregnum is included), Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur I or II and one whose name begins Marduk-, of whom there is a surfeit of potential candidates following Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur I but none following Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur II. Historian A. K. Grayson favors identification with the earlier two of the homonymous monarchs.\n\nThe main products mentioned, barley (\"-im\"), dates (), sesame () and wool () were in widespread use as commodities for exchange from the earliest of times. Their sequence follows that of the astronomic diaries, which also include mustard/cuscuta and cress/cardamom whose economic significance developed in the first millennium.\n\n"}
{"id": "22563859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22563859", "title": "Chronique romane", "text": "Chronique romane\n\nThe Chronique romane (\"romance chronicle\") or Chronicle of Montpellier () is an Old Occitan and Middle French chronicle of the city of Montpellier. The \"Chronique\" was probably made for the use of town officials, who would have wanted a record of local history for help in administration and in forging civic pride. The recording of town officials, such as council members, was also important, and in two manuscripts the \"Chronique\" is found along with the \"Charte de 1204\", a compilation of local customary law. Its annalistic format was typical of civic chronicles of the same period.\n\nThe \"Chronique\" survived in five manuscripts at one point. The annals of \"Montpellier H119\", now among the \"fonds anciens\" (ancient sources) in the Bibliothèque de la faculté de médecine at Montpellier, cover the entire period 816–1364. The lost manuscript called \"Joubert\", formerly of the Bibliothèque Royale at Paris, contained only the annals for 1088–1264. The \"Thalamus des archives du roi\" is now also lost, leaving \"Le grand Thalamus de Montpellier\" and \"Le petit Thalamus de Montpellier\", which is kept in the municipal archives of Montpellier and covers the years 814–1604. All the manuscripts derive from a single source for they years they have in common. In general \"Le petit Thalamus\" has the most complete entries, though both it and \"Montpellier H119\" were composed \"negligently and hastily, with frequent orthographic and historical errors\" and differ in the dating of many events.\n\nOrthographic evidence indicates that the manuscript \"Montpellier H119\" is older than \"Le petit Thalamus\". For example, the former spelling \"Montpeslier\" (from Latin \"Montepestalario\") is preferred in the former where \"Montpellier\" occurs in the latter. The final year in \"H119\" is 1364, whereas \"Le petit Thalamus\" continues 340 years to 1604. Earlier copies of the chronicle also contained annual lists of town councillors in the same manuscript, but in the late \"Petit Thalamus\" these lists are found in the margin beside their years of the chronicle. The penultimate entry of the \"H119\" chronicle is for 1295, probably the date of its initial completion, since all entries up to that point are written in a thirteenth-century Gothic script. The possessor of the manuscript in 1364 probably added the final, more cursive, entry himself. \"Le petit Thalamus\" contains many years from between 1295 and 1364, but not 1364 itself.\n\nIn the sixteenth century one President Philippy, a local official, made a critical edition of the text of the \"Thalamus des archives du roi\", but this went unpublished. On the eve of the French Revolution, a Father Pacotte of Saint-Germain-des-Prés also tried to edit the chronicle, but it too went unpublished. The Archaeological Society of Montpellier published the first edition of the chronicle, based on \"Le petit Thalamus\", in 1836. In 2006 a critical edition with English translation based on \"Montpellier H119\" was published by Jeffrey S. Widmayer.\n\nThe editors of \"Le petit Thalamus\" speculated that the original chronicle, from which all the manuscript versions derive, was begun around 1088, during the reign of William V of Montpellier, and continued by a succession of scribes. The selection of this date is probably due to its being the starting point of the chronicle in the \"Joubert\" manuscript, which is the oldest one. However, in evoking the memory of Raymond IV of Toulouse (1093–1105), the original scribe erroneously puts him in power at the time of the death of Charlemagne (814), an unlikely mistake for a contemporary of Raymond's to make. There is no reason the composition could not have begun later.\n\nThe earliest date of the chronicle is 814, the year of Charlemagne's death, incorrectly thought by the scribe to be 809 years after the birth of Christ. The years between 814 and 1134 are only infrequently recorded, and they year 1104 is out of order, but from 1141 the chronicle records multiple entries per year and includes more detail. This may indicate the beginning of the composition. The original scribe may have relied on \"vague historical memory\" and the collective memory of a city that lived for centuries under the rule of one family, the Guilhems, to record events prior to his own day.\n\nThe authors of the chronicle took an especial interest in miracles and the foundation of religious organisations, but it was unusual for clerics of the time to write in the vernacular, unless they were writing for patrons illiterate in Latin.\n\n"}

{"id": "6518257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6518257", "title": "Corpus Juris Canonici", "text": "Corpus Juris Canonici\n\nThe Corpus Juris Canonici (lit. 'Body of Canon Law') is a collection of significant sources of the canon law of the Catholic Church that was applicable to the Latin Church. It was replaced by the 1917 Code of Canon Law which went into effect in 1918. The 1917 Code was later replaced by the 1983 Code of Canon Law, the codification of canon law currently in effect for the Latin Church. In 1990, Oriental canon law was codified in the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, which is currently in effect for the Eastern Catholic Churches.\n\nThe \"Corpus juris canonici\" was used in canonical courts of the Catholic Church such as those in each diocese and in the courts of appeal at the Roman Curia such as the \"Roman Rota\".\n\nThe term \"corpus juris canonici\" was used to denote the system of canonical law beginning in the thirteenth century.\n\nThe term \"corpus\" (Latin for 'body') here denotes a collection of documents; \"corpus juris\", a collection of laws, especially if they are placed in systematic order. It may signify also an official and complete collection of a legislation made by the legislative power, comprising all the laws which are in force in a country or society. The term, although it never received legal sanction in either Roman or canon law, being merely academic phraseology, is used in the above sense when the \"Corpus juris civilis\" of the Christian Roman Emperors is meant.\nThe expression \"corpus juris\" may also mean, not the collection of laws itself, but the legislation of a society considered as a whole. Hence Benedict XIV could rightly say that the collection of his Bulls formed part of the corpus juris. One best explains the signification of the term \"corpus juris canonici\" by showing the successive meanings which were usually assigned to it in the past and at the present day.\nUnder the name of \"corpus canonum\" ('body of canons') were designated the collection of Dionysius Exiguus and the \"Collectio Anselmo dedicata\" (see below). The \"Decretum\" of Gratian is already called \"Corpus juris canonici\" by a glossator of the 12th century, and Innocent IV calls by this name the \"Decretales\" or Decretals of Gregory IX.\nSince the second half of the 13th century, \"Corpus juris canonici\" in contradistinction to the Roman \"Corpus juris civilis\" of Justinian I, generally denoted the following collections: the \"Decretals\" of Gregory IX; those of Boniface VIII (Sixth Book of the Decretals); those of Clement V (Clementinæ) i. e. the collections which at that time, with the \"Decretum\" of Gratian, were taught and explained at the universities.\nAt the present day, under the above title are commonly understood these three collections with the addition of the \"Decretum\" of Gratian, the \"Extravagantes\" (laws 'circulating outside' the standard sources) of John XXII, and the \"Extravagantes Communes\".\n\nThus understood, the term dates back to the 16th century and was officially sanctioned by Gregory XIII. The earliest editions of these texts printed under the now usual title of \"Corpus juris canonici\", date from the end of the 16th century (Frankfort, 8vo, 1586; Paris, fol., 1587).\nIn the strict sense of the word the Church does not possess a \"corpus juris clausum\" ('closed body of law'), i. e. a collection of laws to which new ones cannot be added. The Council of Basle (Sess. XXIII, ch. vi) and the decree of the Congregation \"\"Super statu regularium\" (25 January 1848) do not speak of a \"corpus clausum\"; the first refers to \"reservationibus in corpore juris expresse clausis\": reservations of ecclesiastical benefices contained in the \"Corpus juris\", especially in the \"Liber sextus\" of Boniface VIII, to the exclusion of those held in the \"Extravagantes\" described below, and at that time not comprised in the \"Corpus juris canonici\"; the second speaks of \"cuilibet privilegio, licet in corpore juris clauso et confirmato\"\", i. e. of privileges not only granted by the Holy See but also inserted in the official collections of canon law.\n\nIt was about 1150 that Gratian, professor of theology at the University of Bologna and sometimes believed to have been a Camaldolese monk, composed the work entitled by himself \"Concordia discordantium canonum\", but called by others \"Nova collectio\", \"Decreta\", \"Corpus juris canonici\", also \"Decretum Gratiani\", the latter being now the commonly accepted name. He did this to obviate the difficulties which beset the study of practical, external theology (\"theologia practica externa\"), i. e. the study of canon law. In spite of its great reputation and wide diffusion, the \"Decretum\" has never been recognized by the Church as an official collection.\n\nThe general laws of a later date than the \"Decree\" of Gratian have been called \"Extravagantes\", i. e. laws not contained in Gratian's \"Decretum\" (\"Vagantes extra Decretum\"). These were soon brought together in new collections, five of which (Quinque compilationes antiquæ) possessed a special authority. Two of them, namely the third and the fifth, are the most ancient official compilations of the Roman Church (see Papal Decretals). Among other compilations at the end of the twelfth and the beginning of the 13th century the following deserve special attention: \"Appendix concilii Lateranensis III\"; the collections known as \"Bambergensis\" (Bamberg), \"Lipsiensis\" (Leipzig), \"Casselana\" (Cassel) \"Halensis\" (Halle), and \"Lucensis\" (Lucca), so named from the libraries it which the manuscripts of these collections were found; the collection of the Italian Benedictine Rainerus Pomposianus, that of the English canonist Gilbert (Collectio Gilberti), that of his countryman Alanus, professor at Bologna (Collectio Alani) and that of the Spaniard Bernard of Compostella. But soon the new era of official collections began to dawn.\n\nIn 1230 Gregory IX ordered St. Raymund of Pennafort to make a new collection, which is called the \"Decretals of Gregory IX\" (\"Decretales Gregorii IX\"). To this collection he gave force of law by the Bull \"Rex pacificus\", 5 September 1234. This collection is also known to canonists as the \"Liber extra\", i. e. extra Decretum Gratiani. Boniface VIII published a similar code on 3 March 1298, called the \"Sixth Book of the Decretals\" (Liber Sextus), including the \"Regulæ Juris\". John XXII added to it the last official collection of Canon law, the \"Liber Septimus Decretalium\", better known under the title of \"Constitutiones Clementis V\", or simply \"Clementinæ\" (Quoniam nulla, 25 October 1317). Later on the canonists added to the manuscripts of the \"Decretals\" the most important constitutions of succeeding popes. These were soon known and quoted as \"Extravagantes\", i. e. twenty constitutions of John XXII himself, and those of other popes to 1484. In the Paris edition of the canonical collections (1499–1505) Jean Chappuis drew them up in the form since then universally accepted, and kept for the first the name \"Extravagantes Joannis XXII\", and called the others, \"Extravagantes communes\", i. e. commonly met with in the manuscripts of the \"Decretals\" (see Papal Decretals).\n\nThe \"Corpus Juris Canonici\" was now complete, but it contained collections of widely different juridical value. Considered as collections, the \"Decree\" of Gratian, the \"Extravagantes Joannis XXII\" and the \"Extravagantes communes\" never had a legal value, but the documents which they contain often do possess very great authority. Moreover, custom has even given to several apocryphal canons of the \"Decree\" of Gratian the force of law. The other collections are official, and consist of legislative decisions still binding, unless abrogated by subsequent legislation.\nThe collections of Gregory IX (Libri quinque Decretalium) and of Boniface VIII (Liber Sextus) are moreover exclusive. The former, indeed, abrogated all the laws contained in the aforesaid compilations subsequent to the \"Decree\" of Gratian. Several authors however maintained, but wrongly, that it abrogated also all the ancient laws which had not been incorporated in Gratian. The second abrogated all the laws passed at a later date than the \"Decretals\" of Gregory IX and not included in itself. Each of these three collections is considered as one collection (collectio una), i. e. one of which all the decisions have the same value, even if they appear to contain antinomies. It is to be noted, however, that, in cases of contradiction, the decisions of the collections of later date invalidate those found in a collection of an earlier date.\n\nThe \"Decretals\" of Gregory IX, those of Boniface VIII and the \"Clementinæ' are divided uniformly into five books (\"liber\"), the books into titles (\"titulus\"), the titles into chapters (\"caput\"), and treat successively of jurisdiction (\"judex\"), procedure (judicium), the clergy (\"clerus\"), marriage (\"connubium\"), and delinquencies (\"crimen\"). The rubrics, i. e. the summaries of the various titles, have the force of law, if they contain a complete meaning; on the other hand, the summaries of the chapters have not this juridical value.\n\nIt is customary to quote these collections by indicating the number of the chapter, the title of the collection, the heading of the title, the number of the book and the title. The \"Decretals\" of Gregory IX are indicated by the letter \"X\", i. e. extra Decretum Gratiani; the \"Sixth Book\" or \"Decretals\" of Boniface VIII by \"in VIº\" i. e. \"in Sexto\"; the \"Clementines\" by \"in Clem.\", i. e. \"in Clementinis\". For instance: \"c. 2, X, De pactis, I, 35\", refers to the second chapter of the \"Decretals\" of Gregory IX, first book, title 35; \"c. 2, in VIº, De hæreticis, V, 2\", refers to the second chapter of the \"Decretals\" of Boniface VIII, fifth book, title. 2; \"c. 2, in Clem., De testibus, II, 8\", refers to the second chapter of the \"Clementines\", second book, title 8. If there is only one chapter in a title, or if the last chapter is quoted, these passages are indicated by \"c. unic.\", and \"c. ult.\", i. e. \"caput. unicum\" and \"caput ultimum\". Sometimes also the indication of the number of the chapters is replaced by the first words of the chapter, as for instance: c. Odoardus. In such cases the number of the chapter may be found in the index-tables printed in all the editions.\nThe \"Extravagantes Communes\" are divided and quoted in the same manner as the \"Decretals\", and the collection is indicated by the abbreviation: \"Extrav. Commun.\" For instance: \"c. 1 (or unicum, or Ambitiosæ), Extrav. Commun., De rebus Ecclesiæ non alienandis, III, 4\", refers to the first chapter (the only chapter) in book III, title 4 of the \"Extravagantes Communes\". This collection omits the usual \"Liber IV\" which treats of marriage. The \"Extravagantes of John XXII\" are divided only into titles and chapters. They are indicated by the abbreviation, \"Extrav. Joan. XXII\". For instance: \"c. 2, Extrav. Joan. XXII, De verborum significatione XIV\" refers to the second chapter of the fourteenth title of this collection.\n\nVery soon after the invention of printing editions of the \"Corpus Juris\", with or without the gloss (comments of canonists) were published. We already mentioned the importance of the Paris edition (1499–1505) for the two collections of \"Extravagantes\"; it includes the gloss. The last edition with the gloss is that of Lyons (1671).\n\nThough the Council of Trent (1545–63) did not order a revision of the text of the canonical collections, St. Pius V appointed in 1566 a commission to prepare a new edition of the \"Corpus Juris Canonici\". This commission devoted itself especially to the correction of the text of the \"Decree\" of Gratian and of its gloss. Gregory XIII decreed that no change was to be made in the revised text. This edition of the \"Corpus\" appeared at Rome in 1582, \"in œdibus populi Romani\", and serves as exemplar for all subsequent editions. The best-known, previous to the 19th century, are those of the brothers Pithou (Paris, 1687), Freiesleben (Prague, 1728) and the Protestant canonist Böhmer (Halle-Magdeburg, 1747). The text of the latter edition differs from that of the Roman edition of 1582, and does not therefore possess practical utility.

This founding document of the Mexican nation was drafted in the National Palace in Mexico City on September 28, 1821, by Juan José Espinosa de los Monteros, secretary of the Provisional Governmental Board.\n\nThree copies of the act were executed. One was destroyed in a fire in 1909. The other two copies are in the Museo Historico de Acapulco Fuerte de San Diego in Acapulco and in the General Archive of the Nation in Mexico City.\n\nThe document is wide and high.\n\nOn September 27, 1821, eleven years and eleven days after the Grito de Dolores, the Army of the Three Guarantees headed by Agustín de Iturbide entered Mexico City, concluding the Mexican War of Independence. On September 28, Iturbide installed the Provisional Governing Board, comprising 38 people. The board was chaired by Antonio Pérez Martínez y Robles, and Juan José Espinosa de los Monteros was secretary. The board immediately elected the five members of the Regency of the Empire.\n\nOn October 13 of the same year, Ramón Gutiérrez del Mazo, the first political chief of Mexico City, distributed a proclamation with the Declaration of Independence so all the people could read it, especially the courts, governors and military authorities, for them to publish it nationwide.\n\nOn the afternoon of September 28, members of the Board met at the National Palace to draft the Declaration of Independence of the newly independent nation. The resulting two documents were drafted in its final form by Juan José Espinosa de los Monteros, Secretary of the Board. The acts were signed by 33 of the 38 members of the Board and Iturbide as President of the Regency of the Empire. Juan O'Donojú, last Superior Political Chief of New Spain, Francisco Severo Maldonado, José Domingo Rus, José Mariano de Almanza and Miguel Sánchez Enciso did not sign the documents, but in the acts was written: \"Place of signature Juan O'Donoju\" and later his signature was added in the printed copies. The signatures of other four members were not added. Juan Jose Espinoza de los Monteros signed twice in each act, once as a member of the Board and the second as secretary, so that the acts contain 35 signatures and the designated to O'Donojú. A copy of the act was for the government and one for the board, the last one was later sent to the Chamber of Deputies. None of the former insurgents—such as Guadalupe Victoria, Vicente Guerrero or Nicolás Bravo—signed the Declaration of Independence; the reason is unknown but probably because they wanted a Republic not an Empire.\n\nThe following is the list of the people who signed the Declaration of Independence, the names are written like in the acts. Juan O'Donoju did not sign but his name was written in the acts. Of the 38 members of the Provisional Governmental Board only 34 signed the document (including the aforementioned firm O'Donoju). The signatures of Francisco Severo Maldonado, José Domingo Rus, José Mariano de Almanza and Miguel Sánchez Enciso did not appear to have suffered a possible impairment due to illness.\n\n\nThree originals of the document were created and signed.\n\nOne copy was given to the Provisional Governmental Board, which was later put on display in the Chamber of Deputies until 1909, when fire destroyed the location.\n\nThe Ruiz de Velasco family were the original owners for 128 years of the Acta de Independencia del Imperio Mexicano de 1821. This document was passed down through generations from Nicolás Bravo. On August 22, 1987, Pedro Ruiz de Velasco de la Madrid gave the document as a gift to Mexico. José Francisco Ruiz Massieu, Governor of Guerrero, accepted this gift and secured this historical document in the Museo Historico de Acapulco Fuerte de San Diego in Acapulco in the State of Guerrero.\n\nA third copy was given to the Regency of the Empire, which remained at the National Palace and was stolen in 1830. Foreign Minister Lucas Alamán made this reference about the stolen:\n\nAlamán wanted to get the record during his tenure as foreign minister but failed even when he offered a lot of money for it.\n\nDecades later, the act was acquired by Emperor Maximilian I, although it is unknown how and where he got it. The act contains in the back the figure of the ex libris of Maximilian's library. After Maxilian's execution, Agustin Fischer, confessor of the emperor, took the document out of the country.\n\nSome time later, the act appeared in Spain in the library of antiquarian Gabriel Sánchez. It is also unknown how he got it, but is a fact that the act has in the back the stamp of the Spanish antiquarian library. Sánchez sold the document to the Mexican historian Joaquín García Icazbalceta, who preserved it and passed it down to his son Luis García Pimentel.\n\nFlorencio Gavito Bustillo lived in France and there he was contacted by Luis García Pimentel, who offered to sell him the Declaration of Independence. After buying the act for 10 thousand pesos he returned to Mexico with the intention of delivering the act to the Mexican government himself, but he died of leukemia in 1958. Gavito expressed in his will the wish that the act should be delivered to the president.\n\nThe Mexican government sent the document for opinions of authenticity. The opinions were ready on November 14, 1961.\n\nThe ceremony to deliver the act was held on November 21 of the same year. Florencio Gavito Jauregui, son of Gavito Bustillo gave the act to the president Adolfo López Mateos. In the ceremony were also Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, Secretary of the Interior and Jaime Torres Bodet, Secretary of Education.\n\nThe act was put on display for a while in Chapultepec Castle and then it was withdrawn and sent to the General Archive of the Nation.\n\nIn 2008, the restoration works on the act began and it was exhibited for a month at the Palace of Lecumberri. In 2010 it was put on display at the National Palace as part of the celebration of the bicentennial of the beginning of Mexico's independence. The National Institute of Anthropology and History was concerned about the exposure of the act and recommended not to expose it to more time because it does not have a special system for that.\n\nThe act is protected between two flyleaves made with acid-free materials in the vault of the General Archive of the Nation under climate monitoring. Experts of the National Autonomous University of Mexico are working on a system of preservation and exhibition of historical documents in order to permanently exhibit the act in the near future.\n\n\n\n"}

Edited by William Smith, the dictionary spans three volumes and 3,700 pages. It is a classic work of 19th-century lexicography. The work is a companion to Smith's \"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities\" and \"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography\".\n\nThe work lists thirty-five authors in addition to the editor, who is also an author for some definitions and articles. The authors were classical scholars, primarily from Oxford, Cambridge, Rugby School, and the University of Bonn, but some were from other institutions. Many of the mythological entries were the work of the German expatriate Leonhard Schmitz, who helped to popularise German classical scholarship in Britain.\n\nWith respect to biographies, Smith intended to be comprehensive. In the preface, he writes:The biographical articles in this work include the names of all persons of any importance which occur in the Greek and Roman writers, from the earliest times down to the extinction of the Western Empire in the year 476 of our era, and to the extinction of the Eastern Empire by the capture of Constantinople by the turks in the year 1453.Samuel Sharpe thought Edward Bunbury had plagiarised his work, as he wrote of in his diary entry on 3 September 1850: I certainly felt mortified on reading the articles on the Ptolemies in Dr. Smith's \"Dictionary of Classical Biography.\" They were all written by E. H. Bunbury with the help of my \"History of Egypt,\" and with-out any acknowledgment, though he even borrowed the volume from my brother Dan for the purpose.Many of the \"Dictionary\"'s definitions and articles have been referred to in more recent works, and Robert Graves has been accused of \"lifting his impressive-looking source references straight, and unchecked\" from it when writing \"The Greek Myths\".\n\nThe work is now in the public domain, and is available in several places on the Internet. While still largely accurate (only rarely have ancient texts been emended so severely as to warrant a biographical change), much is missing, especially more recent discoveries (such as Aristotle's \"Constitution of the Athenians\", or the decipherment of Linear B) and epigraphic material. Perhaps more seriously, the context in which ancient evidence is viewed has often changed in the intervening century and a half.\n\n\n\nAlso the Internet Archive has a derivative work:\n"}
{"id": "169491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169491", "title": "Don Camillo", "text": "Don Camillo\n\nDon Camillo is a character created by the Italian writer and journalist Giovannino Guareschi, whose name, and some of his character, is based on an actual Roman Catholic priest, World War II partisan and detainee at the concentration camps of Dachau and Mauthausen, named Don Camillo Valota (1912–1998). Guareschi was also inspired by Don Alessandro Parenti, a priest of Trepalle, near the Swiss border. The fictional Don Camillo is one of two main protagonists of Guareschi's short stories, the other being the communist mayor of the town, Peppone. The stories are set in what Guareschi refers to as the \"small world\" of rural Italy after World War II.\n\nMost of the Don Camillo stories came out in the weekly magazine \"Candido\", founded by Guareschi with Giovanni Mosca. These \"Little World\" (Italian: \"Mondo piccolo\") stories amounted to 347 in total and were put together and published in eight books, only the first three of which were published when Guareschi was still alive.\n\nIn the post-war years (after 1945), Don Camillo Tarocci (his full name, which he rarely uses) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the Po valley in northern Italy. Don Camillo is a big man, tall and strong with hard fists. For the films, the town chosen to represent that of the books was Brescello (which currently has a museum dedicated to Don Camillo and Peppone) after the production of movies based on Guareschi's tales, but in the first story Don Camillo is introduced as the parish priest of Ponteratto.\nDon Camillo is constantly at odds with the communist mayor, Giuseppe Bottazzi, better known as Peppone (meaning, roughly, \"Big Joe\") and is also on very close terms with the crucifix in his town church. Through the crucifix he hears the voice of Christ. The Christ in the crucifix often has far greater understanding than Don Camillo of the troubles of the people, and has to constantly but gently reprimand the priest for his impatience.\n\nWhat Peppone and Camillo have in common is an interest in the well-being of the town. They also appear to have both been partisan fighters during World War II; one episode mentions Camillo having braved German patrols in order to reach Peppone and his fellow Communists in the mountains and administer Mass to them under field conditions. While Peppone makes public speeches about how \"the reactionaries\" ought to be shot, and Don Camillo preaches fire and brimstone against \"godless Communists\", they actually grudgingly admire each other. Therefore, they sometimes end up working together in peculiar circumstances, though keeping up their squabbling. Thus, although he publicly opposes the Church as a Party duty, Peppone takes his gang to the church and baptises his children there, which makes him part of Don Camillo's flock; also, Peppone and other Communists are seen as sharing in veneration of the Virgin Mary and local Saints. Don Camillo also never condemns Peppone himself, but the ideology of communism which is in direct opposition to the church.\n\nAs depicted in the stories, the Communists are the only political party with a mass grassroots organization in the town. The Italian Christian Democratic Party, the main force in Italian politics at the time, does not have a local political organization (at least, none is ever mentioned); rather, it is the Catholic Church which unofficially but very obviously plays that role. Don Camillo thus plays an explicitly political as well as religious role. For example, when the Communists organize a local campaign to sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal, it is Don Camillo who organizes a counter-campaign, and townspeople take for granted that such a political campaign is part of his work as priest.\n\nMany stories are satirical and take on the real world political divide between the Italian Roman Catholic Church and the Italian Communist Party, not to mention other worldly politics. Others are tragedies about schism, politically motivated murder, and personal vendettas in a small town where everyone knows everyone else, but not everyone necessarily likes everyone else very much.\n\nPolitical forces other than the Communists and the Catholics have only a marginal presence. In one episode the local Communists are incensed at the announcement that the small Italian Liberal Party has scheduled an elections rally in their town, and mobilize in force to break it up — only to discover virtually no local Liberals have turned up; the Liberal speaker, a middle-aged professor, speaks to a predominantly Communist audience and wins its grudging respect by his courage and determination.\n\nIn one story, Don Camillo visits the Soviet Union, pretending to be a comrade. In another, the arrival of pop culture and motorcycles propels Don Camillo into fighting \"decadence\", a struggle in which he finds he has his hands full, especially when the Christ mainly smiles benevolently on the young rascals. In this later collection, Peppone is the proprietor of several profitable dealerships, riding the \"Boom\" years of the 1960s in Italy. He is no longer quite the committed Communist he once was, but he still does not get on with Don Camillo — at least not in public. Don Camillo has his own problems — the Second Vatican Council has brought changes in the Church, and a new assistant priest, who comes to be called Don Chichì, has been foisted upon him to see that Don Camillo moves with the times. Don Camillo, of course, has other ideas.\n\nDespite their bickering, the goodness and generosity of each character can be seen during hard times. They always understand and respect each other when one is in danger, when a flood devastates the town, when death takes a loved one, and in many other situations in which the two \"political enemies\" show their mutual respect for one another and fight side by side for the same ideals (even if they are each conditioned by their individual public roles in society).\n\nGuareschi created a second series of novels about a similar character, Don Candido, Archbishop of Trebilie (or Trebiglie, literally \"three marble balls\" or \"three billiard balls\"). The name of this fictional town is a play on words of Trepalle (literally \"three balls\"), a real town (near Livigno) whose priest was an acquaintance of Guareschi's.\n\nThe following Italian language books have been published:\n\nThe following Italian language books have been published posthumously:\n\nThe following US English translations have been published:\n\nThe following UK English translations have been published:\n\nThe following five were compiled into a larger book published in 1980: \"The World of Don Camillo\", to coincide with the television adaptation:\n\n\n\"The World of Don Camillo\" does not contain all the stories contained in the individual books. The Italian, US English and UK English publications often have a different number of stories within them.\n\nA series of black-and-white films were made between 1952 and 1965. These were French-Italian coproductions and were simultaneously released in both languages. Don Camillo was played by French actor Fernandel, Peppone by the Italian actor Gino Cervi, quite a Guareschi-lookalike, both tall and bulky with big mustaches. The author of the original stories was involved in the scripts and helped select the main actors. To this day, the films are screened in Europe. The titles were:\n\n\nMario Camerini began filming the French-Italian film \"Don Camillo e i giovani d'oggi\" but had to stop filming due to Fernandel's falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death. The film was then completed in 1972 with Gastone Moschin playing the role of Don Camillo and Lionel Stander as Peppone. A Don Camillo (\"The World of Don Camillo\"; Italian: \"Don Camillo\") film was remade in 1983, an Italian production with Terence Hill directing and also starring as Don Camillo. Colin Blakely performed Peppone in one of his last film roles.\n\nA BBC Radio English-language radio dramatization of \"The Little World of Don Camillo\" was broadcast in 2001 starring Alun Armstrong as Don Camillo, John Moffatt as the Bishop, Shaun Prendergast as Peppone and Joss Ackland as God, and rebroadcast in July 2010 on BBC Radio 7.\n\nFour further BBC Radio series of \"The Little World of Don Camillo\" were made, with the final series broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006. Ian Hogg replaced Armstrong as Don Camillo, while Prendergast, Ackland and Moffatt all continued to reprise their roles as Peppone, God and the Bishop respectively. BBC Radio 7 broadcast the second and third series throughout August and September 2010 with the fourth series beginning on 6 October.\n\nIn 1980, the BBC produced the television series \"The Little World of Don Camillo\", based on the stories, starring Italian-German actor Mario Adorf as Don Camillo and Englishman Brian Blessed as Peppone. The narrator and Voice of the Christ was Cyril Cusack.\n\nIn Colombia the stories were adapted into a TV comedy called \"Don Camilo\". The Italian Communist era was changed to a Colombian period called \"La Violencia\" when the Liberal and Conservative parties were fighting to maintain power in Colombia. The comedy was produced from 1987 to 1988 by the now defunct Coestrellas company and produced and directed by Daniel Samper Pizano and Bernando Romero Pereiro. The series starred Carlos Benjumea as Don Camillo (Don Camilo in Colombian Spanish), Hector Rivas as Peppone (Pepón in Colombian Spanish), Luis Fernando Múnera as The Christ Voice, and the actors Diego León Hoyos and Manuel Pachón as Peppone flunkies. The series was broadcast on Mondays at 10:00 pm by Cadena 2 (Señal Institucional now) and rebroadcast by Señal Colombia in 2011 and Canal Uno in 2014.\n\n\"The Little World of Don Camillo\" was adapted by the Thai writer and politician Kukrit Pramoj into his own 1954 novel, \"Phai Daeng\" (Red Bamboo).\n\n\n"}

The house provides a window into a wide variety of 18th-century home construction methods. It is now maintained by Connecticut Landmarks, and is open seasonally between May and October. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\nThe Hatheway House is located in the village center of Suffield, on the west side of South Main Street, south of its junction with Bridge Street.

Each section is covered by gambrel roof and is sheated in wooden clapboards. The center block, built in 1762, has a large central chimney, and its interior is finished with high-quality Georgian woodwork. The southern ell is an older structure with simple finishes, and may date as far back as 1732. The northern addition was added in 1795.

The standard, now referred to as ITU-R BS.468-4, defines a weighting filter curve, together with a quasi-peak rectifier having special characteristics as defined by specified tone-burst tests. It is currently maintained by the International Telecommunications Union who took it over from the CCIR.\n\nIt is used especially in the UK, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa. It is less well known in the USA where A-weighting has always been used.\n\nM-weighting is a closely related filter, an offset version of the same curve, without the quasi-peak detector. See Present usage of 468-weighting.\n\nWhile most audio engineers are familiar with the A-weighting curve, which was based on the 40 phon equal-loudness contour derived initially by Fletcher and Munson (1933) the later CCIR-468 weighting curve, now supported as an ITU standard is less well known outside of the UK and Europe. Originally incorporated into an ANSI standard for sound level meters, A-weighting was intended for measurement of the audibility of sounds by themselves. It was never specifically intended for the measurement of the more random (near-white or pink) noise in electronic equipment, though has been used for this purpose by most microphone manufacturers since the 1970s. The human ear responds quite differently to clicks and bursts of random noise, and it is this difference that gave rise to the 468-weighting, which together with quasi-peak measurement (rather than the rms measurement used with A-weighting) became widely used by broadcasters throughout Britain, Europe, and former British Commonwealth countries, where engineers were heavily influenced by BBC test methods. Telephone companies worldwide have also used methods similar to 468 weighting with quasi-peak measurement to describe objectionable interference induced in one telephone circuit by switching transients in another.\n\nDevelopments in the 1960s, in particular the spread of FM broadcasting and the development of the compact audio cassette with Dolby-B Noise Reduction, alerted engineers to the need for a weighting curve that gave subjectively meaningful results on the typical random noise that limited the performance of broadcast circuits, equipment and radio circuits. A-weighting was not giving consistent results, especially on FM radio transmissions and Compact Cassette recording where preemphasis of high frequencies was resulting in increased noise readings that did not correlate with subjective effect. Early efforts to produce a better weighting curve led to a DIN standard that was adopted for European Hi-Fi equipment measurement for a while.\n\nExperiments in the BBC led to BBC Research Department Report EL-17, \"The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits\", in which experiments on numerous test subjects were reported, using a variety of noises ranging from clicks to tone-bursts to pink noise. Subjects were asked to compare these with a 1 kHz tone, and final scores were then compared with measured noise levels using various combinations of weighting filter and quasi-peak detector then in existence (such as those defined in a now discontinued German DIN standard). This led to the CCIR-468 standard which defined a new weighting curve and quasi-peak rectifier.\n\nThe origin of the current ITU-R 468 weighting curve can be traced to 1956. The 1968 BBC EL-17 report discusses several weighting curves, including one identified as \"D.P.B.\" which was chosen as superior to the alternatives: A.S.A, C.C.I.F and O.I.R.T. The report's graph of the DPB curve is identical to that of the ITU-R 486 curve, except that the latter extends to slightly lower and higher frequencies. The BBC report states that this curve was given in a \"contribution by the D.B.P. (The Telephone Administration of the Federal German Republic) in the Red Book Vol. 1 1957 covering the first plenary assembly of the CCITT (Geneva 1956)\". D.B.P. is Deutsche Bundespost, the German post office which provides telephone service in Germany as the GPO does in the UK. The BBC report states \"this characteristic is based on subjective tests described by Belger.\" and cites a 1953 paper by E. Belger. \n\nDolby Laboratories took up the new CCIR-468 weighting for use in measuring noise on their noise reduction systems, both in cinema (Dolby A) and on cassette decks (Dolby B), where other methods of measurement were failing to show up the advantage of such noise reduction. Some Hi-Fi column writers took up 468 weighting enthusiastically, observing that it reflected the roughly 10dB improvement in noise observed subjectively on cassette recordings when using Dolby B while other methods could indicate an actual worsening in some circumstances, because they did not sufficiently attenuate noise above 10 kHz.\n\nCCIR Recommendation 468-1 was published soon after this report, and appears to have been based on the BBC work. Later versions up to CCIR468-4 differed only in minor changes to permitted tolerances. This standard was then incorporated into many other national and international standards (IEC, BSI, JIS, ITU) and adopted widely as the standard method for measuring noise, in broadcasting, professional audio, and 'Hi-Fi' specifications throughout the 1970s. When the CCIR ceased to exist, the standard was officially taken over by the ITU-R (International Telecommunication Union). Current work on this standard occurs primarily in the maintenance of IEC 60268, the international standard for sound systems.\n\nThe CCIR curve differs greatly from A-weighting in the 5 to 8 kHz region where it peaks to +12.2 dB at 6.3 kHz, the region in which we appear to be extremely sensitive to noise. While it has been said (incorrectly) that the difference is due to a requirement for assessing noise intrusiveness in the presence of programme material, rather than just loudness, the BBC report makes clear the fact that this was not the basis of the experiments. The real reason for the difference probably relates to the way in which our ears analyse sounds in terms of spectral content along the cochlea. This behaves like a set of closely spaced filters with a roughly constant Q factor, that is, bandwidths proportional to their centre frequencies. High frequency hair cells would therefore be sensitive to a greater proportion of the total energy in noise than low frequency hair cells. Though hair-cell responses are not exactly constant Q, and matters are further complicated by the way in which the brain integrates adjacent hair-cell outputs, the resultant effect appears roughly as a tilt centred on 1 kHz imposed on the A-weighting.\n\nDependent on spectral content, 468-weighted measurements of noise are generally about 11 dB higher than A-weighted, and this is probably a factor in the recent trend away from 468-weighting in equipment specifications as cassette tape use declines. \n\nIt is important to realise that the 468 specification covers both weighted and 'unweighted' (using a 22 Hz to 22 kHz 18 dB/octave bandpass filter) measurement and that both use a very special quasi-peak rectifier with carefully devised dynamics (A-weighting uses RMS detection for no particular reason). Rather than having a simple 'integration time' this detector requires implementation with two cascaded 'peak followers' each with different attack time-constants carefully chosen to control the response to both single and repeating tone-bursts of various durations. This ensures that measurements on impulsive noise take proper account of our reduced hearing sensitivity to short bursts. This quasi-peak measurement is also called psophometric weighting.\n\nThis was once more important because outside broadcasts were carried over 'music circuits' that used telephone lines, with clicks from Strowger and other electromechanical telephone exchanges. It now finds fresh relevance in the measurement of noise on computer 'Audio Cards' which commonly suffer clicks as drives start and stop.\n\n468-weighting is also used in weighted distortion measurement at 1 kHz. Weighting the distortion residue after removal of the fundamental emphasises high-order harmonics, but only up to 10 kHz or so where the ears response falls off. This results in a single measurement (sometimes called distortion residue measurement) which has been claimed to correspond well with subjective effect even for power amplifiers where crossover distortion is known to be far more audible than normal THD (Total harmonic distortion) measurements would suggest.\n\n468-weighting is still demanded by the BBC and many other broadcasters, with increasing awareness of its existence and the fact that it is more valid on random noise where pure tones do not exist.\n\nOften both A-weighted and 468-weighted figures are quoted for noise, especially in microphone specifications.\n\nWhile not intended for this application, the 468 curve has also been used (offset to place the 0 dB point at 2 kHz rather than 1 kHz) as \"M weighting\" in standards such as ISO 21727 intended to gauge loudness or annoyance of cinema soundtracks. This application of the weighting curve does not include the quasi-peak detector specified in the ITU standard.\n\nNote: this is not the full definitive standard.\nThe weighting curve is specified by both a circuit diagram of a weighting network and a table of amplitude responses.\n\nAbove is the ITU-R 468 Weighting Filter Circuit Diagram. The source and sink impedances are both 600 ohms (resistive), as shown in the diagram. The values are taken directly from the ITU-R 468 specification. Note that since this circuit is purely passive, it cannot create the additional 12dB gain required; any results must be corrected by a factor of 8.1333, or +18.2dB.\n\nTable of amplitude responses:\n\nThe values of the amplitude response table slightly differ from those resulting from the circuit diagram, e.g. because of the finite resolution of the numerical values. In the standard it is said that the 33.06 nF capacitor may be adjusted or an active filter may be used.\n\nModeling at hand the circuit above and some calculus give this formula to get the amplitude response in dB for any given frequency value :\nwhere\n5 kHz single bursts:\n\n5 ms, 5 kHz bursts at repetition rate:\n\nUses 22 Hz HPF and 22 kHz LPF 18dB/decade or greater\n\n\n"}

Several studies indicate that lobby transparency leads to a decrease of corruption.\nRegisters exist for political committees of several countries. Their effectiveness is rated differently, strongly depending on their exact regulations. Many non-mandatory registers do not include powerful lobbyists.\n\nRegister opponents mainly argued in a survey that there would be no need for regulations, since it would be self-regulating and that they would fear a barrier of free exchange of views.\nDifferent from the US, West European countries had only weak lobby regulations for a long time.\nAuthors of a study interpreted that the early West-European politic was not focusing the concept of lobby transparency to gain public confidence into political processes, but rather on promoting economic development by enabling undisturbed communication between politics and economy. This setting of priorities is currently changing due to scandals and public pressure.\n\nMany non-governmental organizations (NGOs) see means of controlling and sanction to handle missing or wrong entries as a central prerequisite for a working register. In many cases there are complains that this has not been put into practice.\n\nMaking an entry only mandatory if a certain threshold of money or time is spent on lobbying should prevent an inappropriately high bureaucratic burden for small actors (for example) in the US. Similar mechanisms are popular among supporters of a register.\n\nImplementation as a database is favored over a list format since it allows not only searches but also enables data analysis and graphical representations.\n\nMost registers contain at least the following data:\nA survey among lobbyists conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) revealed, that a majority of them would support a mandatory register and publication of the data above (excluding financial information).\nSome registers, for example the Canadian, require much more data.\n\nA mandatory, publicly accessible and processable lobby register with enforced financial disclosure and theoretical high punishments exists on federal level, as well as in every state besides Pennsylvania.\nA register was introduced in the US in 1946 with the \"Lobbying Act\". Loopholes in the regulation lead to the fact that only 4 000 of 13 000 lobbyists were registered, before the rules of disclosure were substituted by the stricter Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995. In 2007 this was extended by the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act with more precise definitions and more powerful means of sanction. The data published by this register is relatively informative. But it has been criticized that complaints lead to no action.\nCanada was putting a \"Lobbyist Registration Act\" into operation in 1989. This was extended regularly to comply with higher demands about data given, to extend the applying field of scope and to enable more powerful means of sanction. Maximum punishments are two years in prison and 200,000 Canadian $ .\nThe strong regulations about lobby transparency demand lobbyists to report about their activity on a monthly basis. This includes the information, with which members of parliament or their staff they interacted and about which topics they spoke. The conduct has a law status, is equipped with sanctional power and is controlled by an independent office.\n\nComplaints are pursued publicly, violations have been prosecuted legally in practice.\nIn the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Ontario similar regulations were introduced.\n\nThe Transparency Register is a voluntary lobbyist register operated jointly by the European Parliament and the EU Commission since June 2011. Its coverage extends beyond lobbyists to law firms, NGOs, and think tanks, and it includes information on staff numbers, the legislative proposals they have attempted to influence, and the amount of EU funding they have received. It should be appealing that only registered lobbyists are granted passes that ease access to the parliament. As maximum means of sanction a commented deletion of the entry out of the registry and a withdrawal of the access pass is possible.\nThe transparency gained by this register is seen as minor, since entries are voluntary, were drawn back arbitrarily by lobbyist in the past and incorrect information (which the co-signed code of conduct does not officially allow) is not sanctioned in practice. The register is however in an evaluation phase and there is the prospect of further improvement.\nThe European Parliament is still working to transform it into a mandatory register, while the EU Commission is reluctant. First the reason given for this was that there would be no juristic basis. After a legal study disproved this, the EU Commission agreed that it was juristically possible, but stated that the current voluntary approach was sufficient. The need for a mandatory EU transparency register has also been highlighted by the anti-corruption organisation, Transparency International which has argued for the need to create a robust and credible mandatory register which would serve to increase the public trust in the EU institutions. \nIt has been planned by the EU Parliament in 2011 to publish a legislative footprint in the appendices of legislative reports. This should list all lobbyists that were in contact with the members of parliament or influenced them during the creation of the law text.\nThere is a voluntary register in the United Kingdom since 2011, but some NGOs criticize it as ineffective.\nThere is no mandatory lobby register in Germany.\n\nSince 1972 associations can voluntarily be included in a list reciting their contact data, head and representatives, general interests of the association and the number of their members.\nThe list is limited to associations and there is no data about self-employed lobbyists, lawyers, think tanks and NGOs. There is no financial information and the registration is voluntary. A regulation making a registry in the list mandatory for trade associations to be heard in the Parliament was put out of force later. Many NGOs do not see this list as a means to further promote lobby transparency in Germany.\nSeveral initiatives of members of parliament in the opposition (social, left wing and green party) were denied by government (consisting of the conservatives and liberals 2009-2013).\n\nIn June 2016 the proposal of the opposition was turned down in the Bundestag. In the debate preceding the voting Hans-Peter Uhl, CSU, judiciary of the conservative coalition, warned about the \"discrimination and stigmatization\" of interest groups. Presenting and discussing individual interests should not be criminalized.\n\nThe German states Brandenburg and Rhineland-Palatinate have de facto voluntary lists for associations that are comparable to the list on federal level.\nIn Austria a mandatory lobby register with duty of disclosure including financial information and means of sanction was put into force.\nThe register is still in the early phase, some deadlines to register end 2014, many lawyers wait for clarification by a court´s decision and did not register.\n\nFurther registers have been set up in Australia (in the year 2011), Denmark, France (2010), Ireland, Israel (2008), Lithuania (2001), Macedonia (2008), Netherlands (2012), Poland (2005), Slovenia (2010), Taiwan, Hungary (2006-2011). In some cases long-term-experiences do not yet exist, in some cases the need for improvement is already seen today.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1738734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1738734", "title": "Mare (folklore)", "text": "Mare (folklore)\n\nA Mare (, ; in Old High German and Old Norse) is a malicious entity in Germanic and Slavic folklore that rides on people's chests while they sleep, bringing on bad dreams (or \"nightmares\").\n\nThe word \"mare\" comes (through Middle English \"mare\") from Old English \"mære\", \"mare\", or \"mere\", all feminine nouns. These in turn come from Proto-Germanic \"*marōn\". \"*Marōn\" is the source of , from which are derived ; ; ; ; \"/mara\", Dutch: (), and German: ()\"\". The \"-mar\" in French \"cauchemar\" (\"nightmare\") is borrowed from the Germanic through Old French \"mare\".\n\nThe word may ultimately be traced back to the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root \"*mer-\", \"to rub away\" or \"to harm\". Hungarian folklorist Éva Pócs endorses an alternative etymology, tracing the core term back to the Greek (Indo-European *\"moros\"), meaning \"death\".\n\nIn Norwegian and Danish, the words for \"nightmare\" are \"mareritt\" and \"mareridt\" respectively, which can be directly translated as \"mare-ride\". The Icelandic word \"martröð\" has the same meaning (-\"tröð\" from the verb \"troða\", \"trample\", \"stamp on\", related to \"tread\"), whereas the Swedish \"mardröm\" translates as \"mare-dream\".\n\nThe mare was also believed to \"ride\" horses, which left them exhausted and covered in sweat by the morning. She could also entangle the hair of the sleeping man or beast, resulting in \"marelocks\", called \"marflätor\" (\"mare-braids\") or \"martovor\" (\"mare-tangles\") in Swedish or \"marefletter\" and \"marefloker\" in Norwegian. The belief probably originated as an explanation to the Polish plait phenomenon, a hair disease.\n\nEven trees were thought to be ridden by the mare, resulting in branches being entangled. The undersized, twisted pine-trees growing on coastal rocks and on wet grounds are known in Sweden as \"martallar\" (\"mare-pines\") or in German as \"Alptraum-Kiefer\" (\"nightmare pine\").\n\nAccording to Paul Devereux, mares included witches who took on the form of animals when their spirits went out and about while they were in trance (see the Icelandic example of Geirrid, below). These included animals such as frogs, cats, horses, hares, dogs, oxen, birds and often bees and wasps.\n\nThe mare is attested as early as in the Norse \"Ynglinga saga\" from the 13th century. Here, King Vanlandi Sveigðisson of Uppsala lost his life to a nightmare (\"mara\") conjured by the Finnish sorceress Huld or Hulda, hired by the king's abandoned wife Drífa. The king had broken his promise to return within three years, and after ten years had elapsed the wife engaged the sorceress to either lure the king back to her, or failing that, to assassinate him. Vanlandi had scarcely gone to sleep when he complained that the nightmare \"rode him;\" when the men held the king's head it \"trod on his legs\" on the point of breaking, and when the retinue then \"seized his feet\" the creature fatally \"pressed down on his head.\" \n\nAccording to the \"Vatnsdæla saga\", Thorkel Silver () has a dream about riding a red horse that barely touched ground, which he interpreted as a positive omen, but his wife disagreed, explaining that a mare signified a man's fetch (\"fylgja\"), and that the red color boded bloodiness. This association of the nightmare with fetch is thought to be of late origin, an interpolation in the text dating to circa 1300, with the text exhibiting a \"confounding of the words \"marr\" and \"mara\".\"\n\nAnother possible example is the account in the \"Eyrbyggja saga\" of the sorceress Geirrid accused of assuming the shape of a \"night-rider\" or \"ride-by-night\" (\"marlíðendr\" or \"kveldriða\") and causing serious trampling bruises on Gunnlaug Thorbjornsson. The \"marlíðendr\" mentioned here has been equated to the \"mara\" by commentators.\n\nAs in English, the name appears in the word for \"nightmare\" in the Nordic languages (e.g. the Swedish word \"mardröm\" literally meaning mara-dream, the Norwegian word \"mareritt\" and the Danish \"Mareridt\", both meaning Mare-ride or the Icelandic word \"martröð\" meaning mara-dreaming repeatedly).\n\nIn Germany they were known as \"mara\", \"mahr\", \"mare\".\n\nGerman Folklorist Franz Felix Adalbert Kuhn records a Westphalian charm or prayer used to ward off mares, from Wilhelmsburg near Paderborn:\n\nSuch charms are preceded by the example of the \"Münchener Nachtsegen\" of the fourteenth century (See Elf under §Medieval and early modern German texts). Its texts demonstrates that certainly by the Late Middle Ages, the distinction between the \"mare\", the alp, and the \"trute\" (drude) was being blurred, the mare being described as the alp's mother.\n\nIn Polish folklore, \"zmora\" or \"mara\" are the souls of living people that leave the body during the night, and are seen as wisps of straw or hair or as moths. Accordingly, Polish \"mara\", Czech \"můra\" denote both a kind of elf or spirit as well as a \"sphinx moth\" or \"night butterfly\". Other Slavic languages with cognates that have the double meaning of moth are: Kashubian \"mòra\", and Slovak \"mora\".\n\nIn the north-western Russian and South-Russian traditions, the mara means a female character, similar to kikimora. Mara is usually invisible, but can take the form of a woman with long flowing hair, which she combs, sitting on a yarn. According to other sources, the mara is black, shaggy (olonets, tul.), And also a terrible and disheveled creature (Kaluga).\n\nIn Croatian, \"mora\" refers to a \"nightmare\". \"Mora\" or \"Mara\" is one of the spirits from ancient Slav mythology. Mara was a dark spirit that takes a form of a beautiful woman and then visits men in their dreams, torturing them with desire, and dragging life out of them. In Serbia, a mare is called \"mora\", or \"noćnik/noćnica\" (\"night creature\", masculine and feminine respectively). In Romania they were known as \"Moroi\".\n\nIt is a common belief that \"mora\" enters the room through the keyhole, sits on the chest of the sleepers and tries to strangle them (hence \"moriti\", \"to torture\", \"to bother\", \"to strangle\", \"umoriti\", \"to tire\", \"to kill\", \"umor\", \"tiredness\" and \"umoran\", \"tired\"). To repel \"moras\", children are advised to look at the window or to turn the pillow and make a sign of cross on it (\"prekrstiti jastuk\"); in the early 19th century, Vuk Karadžić mentions that people would repel \"moras\" by leaving a broom upside down behind the door, or putting their belt on top of their sheets, or saying an elaborate prayer poem before they go to sleep.\n\nIn Hungarian, the creature is known as \"éjjeljáró\" or \"night-goer.\" In Estonia, the mare-like spirit is called \"Painaja\" (presser) or \"Külmking\" (cold-shoe). In Thailand, this phenomenon is well documented and called ผีอำ (pee ahm), pee meaning \"ghost\". Buddhist residents wear amulets (พระเครื่อง) blessed by monks to ward off spirits such as these. In Turkey, the mare is known as (ominous-presser).\n\n\nFiction:\n\n"}

First published in 1910, it has become an important reference work for philately, with information not available in the English-language Scott catalog.\n\nThe catalog started out as a price list for the dealer Hugo Michel of Apolda. By 1920 it was split into two volumes, for \"Europe\" and \"overseas\", and eventually grew to a present-day size of about a dozen volumes covering the entire world, with additional specialized volumes bringing the total to some forty catalogs.\n\nIt extensively covers specialized Germany collecting including the complex WW2 era stamps of Germany, occupied territories, and provisional stamps.\n\nUnlike Scott, Michel does not issue a complete set of catalogs every year, instead updating only several of the volumes. Michel is also more detailed, with quantities issued, sheet formats, and so forth. Also of significance to some collectors is its coverage of countries and periods omitted by Scott for editorial or political reasons. For instance, US embargoes against Cuba, Iraq, and North Korea are reflected by Scott's failure to show market values for those countries' stamp issues (as late as 2002, Scott did not supply any information at all about North Korean stamps), and Michel is one of few sources for that information.\n\nMichel also documents stamps issued apparently with little or no intent of being used to pay postage and stamps issued by regions or areas with dubious political status. Scott excludes many issues that were unlikely to be actually used to pay postage.\n\nThere are 15 main catalogues, all issued in German; about 400,000 are printed annually. Their information is also accessible on the Michel internet pages.\nThe standard Germany catalogue (Michel-Deutschland-Katalog) covers all German stamps issues . A more detailed specialized catalogue is available. For young collectors a simplified \"Junior Catalogue\" is available. All these catalogues are published on an annual basis.\n\nCalled \"Europa-Katalog (EK)\" these catalogues appear annually and are divided as follows:\n\nCalled \"Übersee-Katalog (ÜK)\" these catalogues appear about every three years. As of 2014 there are 10 issues, some in two volumes. In contrast to the European catalogues the number of stamps printed is not indicated. Not all issues are represented by images. \n\nAside from Germany, a number of other countries are covered in specialized catalogues that indicate more details such as variations and first day cancellation.

{"id": "243749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=243749", "title": "Multiracial", "text": "Multiracial\n\nMultiracial is defined as made up of or relating to people of many races. Many terms exist for people of various multiracial backgrounds. Some of the terms are considered insulting and offensive. Preferred terms include \"mixed race\" (or simply \"mixed\"), \"multiracial\", \"biracial\", \"multiethnic\", \"polyethnic\", \"half\", \"half-and-half\", \"Métis\", \"Creole\", \"mestizo\", \"mulatto\", \"Melungeon\", \"Criollo\", \"quadroon\", \"zambo\", \"Eurasian\", \"hapa\", \"hāfu\", \"garifuna\" and \"pardo\".\n\nIndividuals of multiracial backgrounds make up a significant portion of the population in many parts of the world. In North America, studies have found that the multiracial population is continuing to grow. In many countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, people with multiracial backgrounds make up the majority of the population. Other countries where multiracial people make up a sizable portion of the population are the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, South Africa, Botswana, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius and Fiji.\n\nWhile defining race is controversial,\n\"race\" remains a commonly used term for categorization. Insofar as race is defined differently in different cultures, perceptions of multiraciality will naturally be subjective.\n\nAccording to U.S. sociologist Troy Duster and ethicist Pilar Ossorio:\n\nIn the United States:\n\nIn the English-speaking world, many terms for people of various multiracial backgrounds exist, some of which are pejorative or are no longer used. \"Mulato\", \"zambo\" and \"mestizo\" are used in Spanish, \"mulato\", \"caboclo\", \"cafuzo\", \"ainoko\" (from Japanese) and \"mestiço\" in Portuguese and \"mulâtre\" and \"métis\" in French for people of multiracial descent. These terms are also in certain contexts used in the English-speaking world. In Canada, the Métis are a recognized ethnic group of mixed European and First Nation descent, who have status in the law similar to that of First Nations.\n\nTerms such as \"mulatto\" for people of partially African descent and \"mestizo\" for people of partially Native American descent are still used by English-speaking people of the western hemisphere, but mostly when referring to the past or to the demography of Latin America and its diasporic population. \"Half-breed\" is a historic term that referred to people of partial Native American ancestry; it is now considered pejorative and discouraged from use. Mestee, once widely used, is now used mostly for members of historically mixed-race groups, such as Louisiana Creoles, Melungeons, Redbones, Brass Ankles and Mayles. In South Africa, and much of English-speaking southern Africa, the term \"Coloured\" was used to describe a mixed-race person and also Asians not of African descent. While the term is socially accepted, it is becoming an outdated due to its association with the apartheid era.\n\nIn Latin America, where mixtures became tri-racial after the introduction of African slavery, a panoply of terms developed during the colonial period, including terms such as \"zambo\" for persons of Amerindian and African descent. Charts and diagrams intended to explain the classifications were common. The well-known \"Casta\" paintings in Mexico and, to some extent, Peru, were illustrations of the different classifications.\n\nAt one time, Latin American census categories have used such classifications, but in Brazilian censuses since the Imperial times, for example, most persons of multiracial heritage, except the Asian Brazilians of some European descent (or any other to the extent it is not clearly perceptible) and vice versa, tend to be thrown into the single category of \"pardo\", although race lines in Brazil do not denote ancestry but phenotype, and as such a westernized Amerindian of copper-colored skin is also a \"pardo\", a \"caboclo\" in this case, despite being not multiracial, but a European-looking person with one or more African or Indigenous American ancestor is not a \"pardo\" but a \"branco\", or a white Brazilian. The same applies to \"negros\" or Afro-Brazilians and European or Amerindian ancestors. Most Brazilians of all racial groups (except Asian-Brazilians and natives) are to some extent mixed-race according to genetic research.\n\nIn English, the terms \"miscegenation\" and \"amalgamation\" were used for unions between whites, blacks, and other ethnic groups. These terms are now often considered offensive and are becoming obsolete. The terms \"mixed-race\", \"biracial\" or \"multiracial\" are becoming generally accepted. In other languages, translations of miscegenation did not become politically incorrect.\n\nIn the United States, the 2000 census was the first in the history of the country to offer respondents the option of identifying themselves as belonging to more than one race. This multiracial option was considered a necessary adaptation to the demographic and cultural changes that the United States has been experiencing.\n\nMultiracial Americans officially numbered 6.1 million in 2006, or 2.0% of the population. There is considerable evidence that an accurate number would be much higher. Prior to the mid-20th century, many people hid their multiracial heritage. The development of binary thinking about race meant that African Americans, a high proportion of whom have also had European ancestry, were classified as black. Some are now reclaiming additional ancestries. Many Americans today are multi-racial without knowing it. According to the Census Bureau, as of 2002, over 75% of all African Americans had multiracial ancestries.\n\nIn 2010, the number of Americans who checked both \"black\" and \"white\" on their census forms was 134 percent higher than it had been a decade earlier.\n\nAccording to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations in the 2000 Census, the multiracial population that is part white is as follows:\n\nThe stigma of a mixed race heritage, associated with racial discrimination among numerous racial groups, has decreased significantly in the United States. People of mixed-race heritage can identify themselves now in the U.S. Census by any combination of races, whereas before Americans were required to select from only one category. For example, in 2010, they were offered choices of one or more racial categories from the following list:\n\n\n\n\nMany mixed raced Americans use the term \"biracial\". The U.S. has a growing multiracial identity movement, reflective of a desire by people to claim their full identities. Interracial marriage, most notably between whites and blacks, was historically deemed immoral and illegal in most states in the 18th, 19th and first half of the 20th century, due to its long association of blacks with the slave caste. California and the western US had similar laws to prohibit European-Asian marriages, which was associated with discrimination against Chinese and Japanese on the West Coast. Many states eventually repealed such laws and a 1967 decision by the US Supreme Court (\"Loving v. Virginia\") overturned all remaining anti-miscegenation laws in the US.\n\nThe United States is one of the most racially diverse countries in the world. The American people are mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various immigrant nationalities culturally distinct in their former countries. Assimilation and integration took place, unevenly at different periods of history, depending on the American region. The \"Americanization\" of foreign ethnic groups and the inter-racial diversity of millions of Americans has been a fundamental part of its history, especially on frontiers where different groups of people came together.\n\nThe former President of the United States, Barack Obama, is a multiracial American, as he is the son of a European American mother and a Luo father from Kenya. He acknowledges both parents. His official White House biography describes him as African American. In Hawai'i, the U.S. state in which he was born, he would be called \"hapa\", which is the Hawaiian word for \"mixed ethnic heritage\".\n\nMultiracial Canadians in 2006 officially totaled 1.5% of the population, up from 1.2% in 2001, although, this number may actually be far higher. The official mixed-race population grew by 25% since the previous census. Of these, the most frequent combinations were \"multiple visible minorities\" (for example, people of mixed black and south Asian heritage form the majority, specifically in Toronto), followed closely by \"white-black\", \"white-Chinese\", \"white-Arab\", and many other smaller mixes.\n\nDuring the time of slavery in the United States, a very large but unknown number of African American slaves escaped to Canada, where slavery was made illegal in 1834, via the Underground Railroad. Many of these people married in with Native Canadian and European-Canadian populations, although their precise numbers and the numbers of their descendants, are not known.\n\nAnother 1.2% of Canadians officially are Métis (descendants of a historical population who were partially Aboriginal—also called \"Indian\" or \"Native\"—and European, particularly English, Scottish, Irish and French ethnic groups). Although listed as a single \"race\" in Canada, the Métis are therefore multi-racial. In particular the Métis population may be far higher than the official numbers state, due to earlier racism causing people to historically hide their mixed heritage. This however is changing, although many Canadians may now be unaware of their mixed race heritage, especially those of Métis descent.\n\nMestizo is the common word used to describe multiracial people in Latin America, especially people with Native American and Spanish or other European ancestry. Mestizos make up a large portion of Latin Americans, comprising a majority in many countries.\n\nIn Latin America, racial mixture was officially acknowledged from colonial times. There was official nomenclature for every conceivable mixture present in the various countries. Initially, this classification was used as a type of caste system, where rights and privileges were accorded depending on one's official racial classification. Official caste distinctions were abolished in many countries of the Spanish-speaking Americas as they became independent of Spain. Several terms have remained in common usage.\n\nRace and racial mixture have played a significant role in the politics of many Latin American countries. In most countries, for example Mexico, Dominican Republic, and Panama, a majority of the population can be described as biracial or multiracial (depending on the country). In Mexico, over 80% of the population is mestizo in some degree or another.\n\nThe Mexican philosopher and educator José Vasconcelos authored an essay on the subject, \"La Raza Cósmica\", celebrating racial mixture. Venezuelan ex-president Hugo Chávez, himself of Spanish, indigenous and African ancestry, made positive references to the mixed race ancestry of most Latin Americans from time to time.\n\nColonialism throughout the West Indies has created diverse populations on many islands, including people of multiracial identities. Of note is the mixture of West African communities, most brought to the region as slaves and East Indian settlers most of whom came as indentured labor after the abolition of slavery. Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Suriname claim the highest populations of such mixtures, known locally as \"douglas\". In addition to mixed African and Indian heritage, inhabitants of Trinidad and Tobago can also have any combination of Amerindian, Latino, European, Chinese, Arab and Jewish heritage.\n\nAccording to the 2000 official census, 38.5% of Brazilians identified themselves as pardo skin color. That option is normally marked by people that consider themselves multiracial (\"mestiço\"). The Mixed Race Day or Mestizo Day (Dia do Mestiço), on 27 June, is official event in States of Amazonas, Roraima e Paraíba and a holyday in two cities. The term \"pardo\" is formally used in the official census but is not used by the population. In Brazilian society, most people who are multiracial call themselves \"moreno\": light-\"moreno\" or dark-\"moreno\". These terms are not considered offensive and focus more on skin color than on ethnicity (it is considered more like other human characteristics such as being short or tall).\n\nThe most common multiracial groups are between European and African (\"mulatto\") and Amerindian and European (\"caboclo\" or \"mameluco\"). But there are also African and Amerindian (\"cafuzo\") and East Asian (mostly Japanese) and European/other (\"ainoko\" or more recently, \"hafu\"). All groups are more or less found throughout the whole country. Brazilian multiracials with the following three origins, Amerindian, European and African, make up the majority. It is said today that 89% or even more of the \"Pardo\" population in Brazil has at least one Amerindian ancestor (most of \"brancos\" or White Brazilian population have some Amerindian or African ancestry too despite nearly half of the country's population self-labeling as \"Caucasian\" in the censuses. In Brazil, it is very common for Mulattoes to claim that they don't have any Amerindian ancestry, though studies have found that if a Brazilian multiracial can trace their ancestry to nearly 8 to 9 generations back, they will have at least one Amerindian ancestor from their maternal side of the family.\n\nSince multiracial relations in Brazilian society have occurred for many generations, some people find it difficult to trace their own ethnic ancestry. Today a majority of mixed-race Brazilians do not really know their ethnic ancestry. Due to their unique features that makes them Brazilian-looking like skin color, lips and nose shape or hair texture, they are only aware that their ancestors were probably Portuguese, African or Amerindian. Also there was a very large number of other Europeans (counted in the millions) who contributed to the Brazilian racial make up, Japanese (the largest Japanese population outside Japan), Italian (the largest Italian population outside Italy) Lebanese (the largest population of Lebanese outside Lebanon), Germans, Poles and Russians. There is also a high percentage of Brazilians of Jewish descent, perhaps hundreds of thousands, mostly found in the northeast of the country who cannot be sure of their ancestry as they descend from the so-called \"Crypto-Jews\" (Jews who practiced Judaism in secret while outwardly pretending to be Catholics, also called Marranos or New-Christians, often considered Portuguese); according to some sources, 1 out of every 3 families to arrive there from Portugal during the colonization was of Jewish origin.\n\nThere is a high level of integration between all groups. However, there exists a great social and economic difference between European descendants (found more among the upper and middle classes) and African, Amerindian and multiracial descendants (found more among the lower classes), what is called Brazilian apartheid.\n\nIn 1991 an analysis of the census showed that 50% of black Caribbean men born in the UK have white partners, and the 2011 BBC documentary \"Mixed Britannia\" noted that 1 in 10 British children are growing up in interracial households. \nIn 2000, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that \"Britain has the highest rate of interracial relationships in the world\" and certainly the UK has the highest rate in the European Union. The 2001 census showed the population of England to be 1.4% mixed-race, compared with 2.7% in Canada and 1.4% in the U.S. estimates of 1.4% in 2002, although this U.S. figure did not include mixed-race people who had a black parent. Both the US and UK have fewer people identifying as mixed race, however, than Canada. By 2020 the mixed-race population is expected to become Britain's largest ethnic minority group with the highest growth rate.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, many multi-racial people have Caribbean, African or Asian heritage. For example, supermodel Naomi Campbell, who has African, Jamaican, and Asian roots. Some, like 2008 Formula One World Champion, Lewis Hamilton, are referred to or describe themselves as 'mixed'.\n\nThe 2001 UK Census included a section entitled 'Mixed' to which 1.4% (1.6% by 2005 estimates) of people responded, which was split further into \"White and Black Caribbean, White and Asian, White and Black African\" and \"Other Mixed\". Despite this, 2005 birth records for the country state at least 3.5% of newborn babies as mixed race.\n\nIn North Africa, a large number of multiracial communities can also be found. Among these are the Haratin oasis-dwellers of Saharan southern Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania. They are believed to be a mixture of Black Africans and Berbers, and constitute a socially and ethnically distinct group.\n\nArab and Ottoman slave traders sold slaves in cumulatively large numbers over the centuries throughout the Persian Gulf, Anatolia, Central Asia and the Arab world and communities descended from these slaves can be found throughout these regions.\n\nAlmost the entire population of Madagascar is an about equal admixture of South East Asian (Indonesian) primarily from Borneo and Bantu-speaking settlers primarily from Mozambique. Years of intermarriages created the Malagasy people, who primarily speak Malagasy, an Austronesian language with Bantu influences.\n\nIn South Africa, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 prohibited marriage between Whites (people of European descent) and non-Whites (being classified as African, Asian and Coloured). It was repealed in 1985.\n\nMultiracial South Africans are commonly referred to as coloureds. According to the 2016 South African Census , they are the second largest minority (8.8%) after white South Africans (8.1%).\n\nToday, many Central Asian populations are an amalgamation of various peoples such as Mongols, Turkics, and Iranians. The Mongol invasion of Central Asia in 13th century resulted in the massacre of the population of Iranians and other Indo-European peoples as well as a large degree of intermarriage and assimilation. Genetic studies shows that Central Asian Turkic people and Hazara are a mixture of Northeast Asians and Indo-European people. Caucasian ancestry is prevalent in almost all central Asian Turkic people. Kazakhs, Hazara, Karakalpaks, Crimean Tatars have more European mtdna than European y-dna. Kyrgyz have mostly European y-dna with substantial European mtdna. Other Turkic people like Uyghurs and Uzbeks have mostly European y-dna but also a significantly higher percentage of European mtdna. Turkmen have predominantly European y-dna and mtdna.\n\nDuring the 1662 Siege of Fort Zeelandia in which Chinese Ming loyalist forces commanded by Koxinga besieged and defeated the Dutch East India Company and conquered Taiwan, the Chinese took Dutch women and children prisoner. The Dutch missionary Antonius Hambroek, two of his daughters, and his wife were among the Dutch prisoners of war with Koxinga. Koxinga sent Hambroek to Fort Zeelandia demanding he persuade them to surrender or else Hambroek would be killed when he returned. Hambroek returned to the Fort, where two of his other daughters were. He urged the Fort not to surrender, and returned to Koxinga's camp. He was then executed by decapitation, and in addition to this, a rumor was spreading among the Chinese that the Dutch were encouraging the native Taiwan aboriginals to kill Chinese, so Koxinga ordered the mass execution Dutch male prisoners in retaliation, in addition to a few women and children also being killed. The surviving Dutch women and children were then turned into slaves. Koxinga took Hambroek's teenage daughter as a concubine, and Dutch women were sold to Chinese soldiers to become their wives, the daily journal of the Dutch fort recorded that \"the best were preserved for the use of the commanders, and then sold to the common soldiers. Happy was she that fell to the lot of an unmarried man, being thereby freed from vexations by the Chinese women, who are very jealous of their husbands.\" In 1684 some of these Dutch wives were still captives of the Chinese.\n\nSome Dutch physical looks like auburn and red hair among people in regions of south Taiwan are a consequence of this episode of Dutch women becoming concubines to the Chinese commanders. The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reported to be living, in Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted with an arrangement to release the prisoners which was proposed by a son of Koxinga's but it came to nothing. The Chinese officers used the Dutch women they received as concubines. The Dutch women were used for sexual pleasure by Koxinga's commanders. This event of Dutch women being distributed to the Chinese soldiers and commanders was recorded in the daily journal of the fort.\n\nA teenage daughter of the Dutch missionary Anthonius Hambroek became a concubine to Koxinga, she was described by the Dutch commander Caeuw as \"a very sweet and pleasing maiden\".\n\nDutch language accounts record this incident of Chinese taking Dutch women as concubines and the date of Hambroek's daughter.\n\nAnglo-Indians are a Eurasian mix which originated in India during the Colonial period beginning with the French, Dutch, Portuguese and other Europeans who came along with them, continuing during the British Raj in India. The estimated population of Anglo-Indians is 600,000 worldwide with the majority living in India and the UK.\n\nArticle 366(2) of the Indian Constitution defines Anglo-Indian as: (2) an Anglo-Indian means a person whose father or any of whose other male progenitors in the male line is or was of European descent but who is domiciled within the territory of India and is or was born within such territory of parents habitually resident therein and not established there for temporary purposes only;\n\nGoans are an assimilation of Indo-Aryan, Eurasian and Luso-Asians ancestries, with many being descendants of the Portuguese, who had a considerable influence on Goa for over 450 years. Many Goans have a considerable amount of Portuguese in them, and tracing back family trees often proves that their family began with Portuguese people who lived many hundreds of years ago. Many Goans today identify their nationality as Portuguese-Goan as they have much Portuguese ancestry and Portuguese surnames.\n\nAs with India, Burma was ruled by the British, from 1826 until 1948. Many European groups vied for control of the country before the British arrived. Intermarriage and mixed-relationships between these settlers and merchants with the local Burmese population, and subsequently between British colonists and the Burmese created a local Eurasian population, known as the Anglo-Burmese. This group dominated colonial society and through the early years of independence. Most Anglo-Burmese now reside primarily in Australia, New Zealand and the UK since Burma received her independence in 1948 with an estimated 52,000 left behind in Burma.\n\nDue to its strategic location in the Indian Ocean, the island of Sri Lanka has been a confluence for settlers from various parts of the world, which has resulted in the formation of several mixed-race ethnicities in the Island. The most notable mixed-race group are the Sri Lankan Moors, who trace their ancestry from Arab traders who settled on the island and intermarried with local women. Today, The Sri Lankan Moors live primarily in urban communities, preserving their Arab-Islamic cultural heritage while adopting many Southern Asian customs.\n\nThe Burghers are a Eurasian ethnic group, consisting for the most part of male-line descendants of European colonists from the 16th to 20th centuries (mostly Portuguese, Dutch, German and British) and local women, with some minorities of Swedish, Norwegian, French and Irish.\n\nThe Sri Lanka Kaffirs are an ethnic group partially descended from 16th-century Portuguese traders and the African slaves who were brought by them. The Kaffirs spoke a distinctive creole based on Portuguese, the Sri Lanka Kaffir language, now extinct. Their cultural heritage includes the dance styles Kaffringna and Manja, as well as the Portuguese Sinhalese, Creole, Afro-Sinhalese varieties.\n\nAccording to government statistics, the population of Singapore as of September 2007 was 4.68 million, of whom multiracial people, including Chindians and Eurasians, formed 2.4%.\n\nIn Singapore and Malaysia, the majority of inter-ethnic marriages are between Chinese and Indians. The offspring of such marriages are informally known as \"Chindian\", though the Malaysian government only classifies them by their father's ethnicity. As the majority of these intermarriages usually involve an Indian groom and Chinese bride, the majority of Chindians in Malaysia are usually classified as \"Indian\" by the Malaysian government. As for the Malays, who are predominantly Muslim, legal restrictions in Malaysia make it uncommon for them to intermarry with either the Indians, who are predominantly Hindu, or the Chinese, who are predominantly Buddhist and Taoist. It is, however, common for Muslims and Arabs in Singapore and Malaysia to take local Malay wives, due to a common Islamic faith.\n\nThe Chitty people, in Singapore and the Malacca state of Malaysia, are Tamils with considerable Malay descent. This was due to the first Tamil settlers taking local wives, since they did not bring along any of their own women with them.\n\nIn the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, there have been many incidents of intermarriage between Chinese and native tribes such as the Murut and Dusun in Sabah, and the Iban and Bisaya in Sarawak. This phenomenon has resulted in a potpourri of cultures in both states where many people claiming to be of native descent have some Chinese blood in them, and many Chinese have native blood in them. The offspring of these mixed marriages are called \"Sino-(name of tribe)\", e.g. Sino-Dusun. Normally, if the father is Chinese, the offspring will adopt Chinese culture and if the father is native then native culture will be adopted, but this is not always the case. These Sino-natives are usually fluent in Malay and English. A smaller number are able to speak Chinese dialects and Mandarin, especially those who have received education in vernacular Chinese schools.\n\nThe Philippines was a Spanish colony for almost four centuries or 333 years, and by the United States for 46 years. This is the cause of many mixed race Filipinos of Spanish Filipino and Philippine-American descent.\n\nAfter the defeat of Spain during the Spanish–American War in 1898, the Philippines and other remaining Spanish colonies were ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Paris. The Philippines was under U.S. sovereignty until 1946, though occupied by Japan during World War II. In 1946, in the Treaty of Manila, the U.S. Recognized the Republic of the Philippines as an independent nation. Even after 1946, the U.S. maintained a heavy military presence in the Philippines, with as many as 21 U.S. military bases and 100,000 U.S. military personnel stationed there. The bases closed in 1992, leaving behind thousands of Amerasian children. Pearl S. Buck International foundation estimates there are 52,000 Amerasians scattered throughout the Philippines with 5,000 in the Clark area of Angeles City. although an academic research paper presented in the U.S. (in 2012) by an Angeles, Pampanga, Philippines Amerasian college research study unit suggests that the number could be a lot more.\n\nIn the United States, intermarriage among Filipinos with other races is common. They have the largest number of interracial marriages among Asian immigrant groups, as documented in California. It is also noted that 21.8% of Philippine-Americans are of mixed lineage.\n\nUnder terms of the Geneva Accords of 1954, departing French troops took thousands of Vietnamese wives and children with them after the First Indochina War. Some 100,000 Eurasians stayed in Vietnam, though after independence from French rule.\n\nThe local Māori were joined from the 1840s onward by large numbers of Europeans colonists, and successive waves of other immigrants. Racial mixing is common, including with later Pacific and Asian immigrants, so that the vast majority of New Zealand's half million Māori now also have some other ancestry, and many who identify as Pākehā may also have Māori forebears.\n\nAt the 2013 census, 11.2 percent of people reported belonging to more than one ethnic group. Younger people were more likely to be multiracial; 22.8 percent of children under 15 reported multiple ethnicities, compared to only 2.6 percent of people 65 and over. Examples of mixed-race New Zealanders include opera singer Kiri Te Kanawa, actress Rena Owen, sportsman Kees Meeuws and former Governor General Paul Reeves.\n\nFiji has long been a multi-ethnic country, with a vast majority of people having multi-racial heritages even if they do not self-identify in that manner. The indigenous Fijians are of mixed Melanesian and Polynesian ancestry, resulting from years of migration of islanders from various places mixing with each other. Fiji Islanders from the Lau group have intermarried with Tongans and other Polynesians over the years. The overwhelming majority of the rest of the indigenous Fijians, though, can be genetically traced to having mixed Polynesian/Melanesian ancestry.\n\nThe Indo-Fijian population is also a hodge-podge of South Asian immigrants (called Girmits in Fiji), who came as indentured labourers beginning in 1879. While a few of these labourers managed to bring wives, many of them either took or were given wives once they arrived in Fiji. The Girmits, who are classified as simply \"Indians\" to this day, came from many parts of the Indian subcontinent of present-day India, Pakistan, and to a lesser degree Bangladesh and Myanmar. It is easy to recognize the Indian mixtures present in Fiji and see obvious traces of Southern and Northern Indians and other groups who have been categorised together. To some degree, even more of this phenomenon would have likely happened if the religious groups represented (primarily Hindu, Muslim and Sikh) had not resisted to some degree marriage between religious groups, which tended to be from more similar parts of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nOver the years, particularly in the sugar cane-growing regions of Western Viti Levu and parts of Vanua Levu, Indo-Fijians and Indigenous Fijians have mixed. Others have Chinese/Fijian ancestry, Indo-Fijian/Samoan or Rotuman ancestry, and European/Fijian ancestry (often called \"part-Fijians\"). The latter are often descendents of shipwrecked sailors and settlers who came during the colonial period. Migration from a dozen or more different Pacific countries (Tuvalu, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa, and Wallis and Futuna being the most prevalent) have added to the various ethnicities and intermarriages.\n\nThe following is a list of ethnic divisions that may contain a mixture of two or more racial groups.\nAfrican and or Amerindian origin\n\nAfrican-Asian origin\n\nAfrican-European origin\n\nAmerican-European origin\n\nAsian origin\n\nArab-Bantu/Nilotic origin\n\nAsian-European or Eurasian origin\n\nAfrican-American-Asian-European origin\n\nOther types\n\n\n\n"}

A procedure is designed to describe who, what, where, when, and why by means of establishing corporate accountability in support of the implementation of a \"policy\". \n\nThe \"how\" is further documented by each organizational unit in the form of \"work instructions\" which aims to further support a procedure by providing greater detail.\n\nAs an example, suppose a manufacturing facility established a policy that all overtime shall be approved. A procedure can be created to establish “Who” can approve overtime (ranks, roles & responsibilities), \"What\" forms or systems must be used, \"Where\" they are located, \"When\" overtime is applicable, and \"Why\" (i.e., the management directive established via a \"policy\"). The output of a procedure is an input to a \"work instruction\" (i.e., a set of actions or operations which must be executed in the same manner in order to achieve intended results under the same circumstances. (For example, in the latter example, the output of the procedure could be further broken down into a work instruction to describe \"how\" a manager/employee should access the systems for approving/reviewing overtime (e.g., first click on this hyperlink, second press this button, third choose these fields, and fourth click approve/reject).\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLES\n\n•The insurance company provides a step-by-step guide to its dispute and complaint procedures for all policy holders to access.\n\n•The Doctor surprised me when he told me that he had used a new procedure to repair the tear in the tendon of my leg.\n\n•In a work place that has complex interactions among employees, it is important to specify and implement a procedure for core processes.\n\nIn telecommunications, a SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) is specifically designed to describe and guide multiple iterations of the same procedure over a broad number of locations, on multiple occasions, and over an open period of time until such SOP is updated or discontinued. Also used heavily in the telecommunications industry, a MOP (Method of Procedure) differs from a SOP in that it contains specific directives for a particular activity, on a particular date, for a specific location, piece of equipment, or circumstance. In today's business model, wherein telecom providers can be both \"provider\" and \"user\", most \"user\" organizations require a MOP from the service provider whenever an activity has the potential to cause a traffic-affecting outage. \n\nThe industry standard is <50ms of traffic interruption. If a \"switch hit\" or traffic interruption is 50 ms or less, it is \"transparent\" to the bit stream carrying the traffic, and is therefore considered \"hitless\" and non-traffic affecting.\n\n"}

It was registered at the Ministry of Interior on November 30, 1999, with offices in Barcelona. The following year it merged with Vértice Social Español to form what it called a \"Social Patriotic force\".\n\nBy its members' own admission, as well as by that of the bulk of the far-right public opinion, the MSR was roughly inscribed in what is usually called the Third Position, and adheres to the commonplace strategy of defending socializing (and at times leftist) doctrines abroad, whereas adopting conservative and anti-immigration stances at a domestic level. Its slogan was 'Spain-Republic-Socialization'.\n\nIn the VII National Congress all the partecipants decided to terminate the movement's experience. So MSR dissolved itself with an official announcement\n30 of January 2018.\n\nThe party has campaigned against immigration into Spain, Turkish membership of the European Union and global capitalism. They support a large programme of re-nationalisation of industries such as electricity and transport. In terms of foreign policies the party takes a strongly pro-Palestinian approach to the Middle East question, criticising Israel alleging that the \"Zionist army are committing daily crimes against the Palestinian people.\" In addition to supporting the Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez, they have also called for the withdrawal of Spanish troops in the Balkans and condemned the American led invasion of Iraq. In the 2000 General Election the party supported the platform of España 2000.\n\nThe party publishes \"Tribuna de Europa\" and \"Libertad\".\n\n \n\n"}

The domain search list, as well as the local domain name, is used by a resolver to create a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) from a relative name. For this purpose, the local domain name functions as a single-item search list.\n\nIn an IPv4 environment, search domains are often set via DHCPv4, along with the local domain name. The domain search list is configured by the \"Domain Search Option\" (DHCPv4 option number 119), while the local domain name is configured by \"Domain Name\" (DHCPv4 option number 15).\n\nThe Windows operating system, however, does not understand the Domain Search Option; as a workaround, many network administrators use Group Policy Objects to set the domain search list for Windows machines.\n\nIn an IPv6 environment, the domain search list is called a DNS Search List (DNSSL) and can be configured by Router Advertisement and DHCP.\n\nIn Linux it can be defined by editing the ifcfg file corresponding to the network. In Mac OS X the setting is located under the DNS tab, next to DNS server settings. A similar setting in Microsoft Windows is the Connection-specific DNS Suffix.\n\nWhen looking up a bare name in DNS, the network stack will add the search domains to it to form fully qualified domain names, and look up those as well. For example, if the domain search list contains \"wikipedia.org\", typing \"en\" in the browser will direct the user to \"en.wikipedia.org\". Some ISPs add their own search domains via DHCP settings, similar to how they add DNS servers and other networking information; if this is undesired, the user can change this setting to \".local\".\n\n"}

It was written by Michele Anna Jordan and was published by William Morrow Cookbooks in the United States in June 2003. Jordan is a food writer and has written for \"The Press Democrat\"; \"The BLT Cookbook\" is her 14th published book. She researched the book for ten years and in the process she taste-tested hundreds of variations on the sandwich, describing it as America's most beloved sandwich. She instructs the reader on how to acquire and prepare the best ingredients for the sandwich. The book includes recipes with varying ingredients, though each recipe includes tomatoes. Many recipes in the book are not sandwiches, and include appetizers, soups, salads, and desserts. Jordan also suggests wines to accompany the sandwich.\n\nThe book was positively received, and the National Pork Board highly recommended it. A review in \"The Detroit News\" said that the book includes \"mouthwatering recipes\", and the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" called it a \"neat little book\" on the subject. The food editor for the \"Daily Herald\" wrote that the book's recipes \"will surely shake up your next toasted meal\". The \"Anchorage Daily News\" called it the \"definitive book\" on the BLT sandwich.\n\n\"The BLT Cookbook\" discusses the author's love of the BLT sandwich, which according to Jordan is \"America's favorite sandwich\". The author wrote, \"There are times when the BLT just tastes right, primal and true, the best thing you could ever eat. The play of the salt and acid, the silk of the tomato against the salt crunch of the bacon ... It is sheer delight.\" She discusses ways the combination can be used in soups, appetizers, and salads. Recipes are provided for multiple versions of the BLT sandwich. Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients. She recommends shopping at farmers' markets for fresh tomatoes, a butcher for choice bacon, and a bakery for fresh bread. The author recommends mayonnaise brands Hellmann's and Best Foods, and Niman bacon from California. Jordan writes, \"For lettuce, remove the first outer leaf and then use only the next three layers. Further in, iceberg lettuce gets a little cabbagey.\"\n\n\"The BLT Cookbook\" begins with a recipe for a mini-cocktail selection of the BLT, followed by a larger version that the author recommends for large gatherings such as picnics. Non-traditional presentations of the BLT combination include \"Tomatoes Stuffed with Bacon Risotto\", \"Potato Soup with Tomatoes and Bacon\" and \"Tomato Bread Pudding\". The author presents varieties of the BLT that omit one ingredient. \"The Fisherman's BLT\"which uses seafoodis an alternative to the standard sandwich and the \"ZLT\" comprises zucchini, lettuce and tomato. Jordan was inspired by a salmon sandwich she bought at Pike Place Market in Seattle to create a BLT sandwich with salmon. The \"Bacon, Leek and Tomato Strudel\" is a dish that does not use bread. All recipes presented in \"The BLT Cookbook\" include tomatoes. Towards the end of the book, recipes for bread pudding, strudel and tomato pie are included. Selected wines that Jordan recommends to accompany her dishes include a Rhone-style red, beaujolais, or pinot noir.\n\nFood writer Michele Anna Jordan has contributed columns published in the food and wine section of \"The Press Democrat\". and restaurant reviews for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\". \"The BLT Cookbook\" is Jordan's 14th book. She decided to write about the BLT sandwich after discovering it was a good remedy for morning sickness, and that others who frequented a food website shared her love of the BLT. Jordan spent ten years researching for the book, and spent a winter writing it. During her research, Jordan taste-tested hundreds of variations on the BLT sandwich. In 2003 the author hosted two radio programs on KRCB-FM, \"Mouthful with Michele Anna Jordan\" and \"Red Shoes Rodeo\". The year the book was published, Jordan crafted a BLT sandwich at the Kendall-Jackson Tomato Festival.\n\n\"The BLT Cookbook\" is \"highly recommended\" by the National Pork Board. Kate Lawson of \"The Detroit News\" wrote that the book offers \"mouthwatering recipes ranging from variations on the classic sandwich to soups, salads and pastas.\" Karola Saekel of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote, \"Recipes for recommended basics like aioli and tomato concasse round out the neat little book.\" Food editor of the \"Daily Herald\" Deborah Pankey wrote in her review of the book, \"While giving the titled trio its due respect, author Michele Anna Jordan introduces a host of other ingredients that will surely shake up your next toasted meal (yes, she favors toast to help maintain the sandwich's structure.)\"\n\n\"The Cincinnati Post\" said, \"[Jordan's] book presents practically all the possibilities for BLT combinations as she leaves the two slices of white toast far behind\". Staff writer for \"ANG Newspapers\" Jolene Thym wrote, \"Not simply a cookbook, the little handbook is a discourse on the sandwich that is elegant enough to coax even the most virtuous eaters to gobble pork fat and mayonnaise with abandon.\" T.C. Mitchell of the \"Anchorage Daily News\" said \"The BLT Cookbook\" is the \"definitive book\" on the sandwich.\n\n\nThe author's current web site is www.micheleannajordan.com\n"}

Located in Chicago, Illinois, VDB was founded at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1976 at the inception of the media arts movement.\n\nVDB provides experimental video art, documentaries made by artists, and interviews with visual artists and critics for a wide range of audiences. These include microcinemas, moving image festivals, media arts centers, universities, libraries, museums, community-based workshops, public television, and cable TV Public-access television centers. Video Data Bank currently holds over 6,000 titles in distribution, by more than 600 artists, available in a variety of screening and archival video formats. It also actively publishes anthologies and curated programs of video art.\n\nThe preservation of historic video is an ongoing project of the Video Data Bank. The total holdings, including works both in and out of distribution, include over 10,000 titles of original and in some cases, rarely seen, video art and documentaries from the late 1960s on. The VDB functions as a Department of the Art Institute of Chicago and is supported in part by awards from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Illinois Arts Council.\n\nIn 1974, VDB co-founders Kate Horsfield and Lyn Blumenthal, graduate students at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, began conducting video interviews with women artists who they felt were underrepresented critically in the art world. After buying a Panasonic Portapak and successfully conducting talks with painters Joan Mitchell and Agnes Martin and curator Marcia Tucker, the pair decided to continue the series. \"It was really a kind of accident,” noted Horsfield in a 2007 interview. “We were looking for inspiration for ourselves, but we were also looking for information on what was happening. If you read art magazines in the early '70s, it was very rare to see any real coverage of any women artists.\" In 1976 Horsfield and Blumenthal officially founded the Video Data Bank, taking over a small collection of student video productions and interviews that was begun by Phil Morton at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. They went on to add to the archive, conducting talks with prominent artists of the period such as Alice Neel, Lucy Lippard, Lee Krasner, Barbara Kruger, and the Guerrilla Girls, who appeared wearing their trademark gorilla masks.\n\nLyn Blumenthal died in 1988, and the VDB maintains the Lyn Blumenthal Memorial Scholarship. Horsfield remained director of the collection until her retirement in 2006, when she was succeeded by Abina Manning. In 2007 the National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture (NAMAC) presented Video Data Bank with its Outstanding Media Arts Organization Award.\n\nThe Video Data Bank collection includes video produced from 1968 to the present. The early video art represented includes many titles from the Castelli-Sonnabend collection, the first and most prominent collection of video art assembled in the United States, produced between 1968 and 1980. These works represent examples of the first experiments in video art and include conceptual and feminist performances recorded on video, experiments with the video signal, and 'guerilla' documentaries representing a counter-cultural view of the historical events of the 1960s. Artists included are Vito Acconci, Lynda Benglis, Dara Birnbaum, Joan Jonas, Bruce Nauman and William Wegman.\n\nThe collection includes the work of contemporary artists who largely address post-modern themes such as feminism, AIDS, gender studies, guerilla television, technology, and identity, among them Sadie Benning, Jem Cohen, Harun Farocki, Walid Raad, Paul Chan, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Miranda July, and George Kuchar.\n\nThe On Art and Artists collection includes interviews with visual artists, photographers and critics. The interviews focus on the development of the artists' body of work.\n\nIn addition, Video Data Bank represents two important video archives: the Kuchar Archive, encompassing the extensive video output of twin brothers George and Mike Kuchar, and the Videofreex Archive, which chronicles the counter-cultural movement of the 1960s and 1970s as documented by the 10-person collective.\n\n\"Surveying the First Decade: Video Art and Alternative Media in the U.S.\" is a 17-hour compilation of experimental and independent video created from 1968-1980, the first decade of video art production produced in 1995.

Filmer was a naturalist and established a private collection at his residence that thousands of people visited.\n\nIn 1865, Filmer was born in Maitland, New South Wales, Australia. He was the son of William Filmer (1828-1902) and Amy Filmer née Hatton (1831-1901). He married Mary Anne E. née Chessell (1868-1951) in 1890 in Sydney. The couple had 4 children: son, Walter Harold Alexandra Filmer (1892-1964), born on 10 February 1892 in Sydney; daughter, Mary Filmer (1895-1895), born in 1895 in Petersham; son, Leroy Drowley Filmer (1902-1976), born on 5 April 1902 in Newcastle; and son, Eric Filmer (1903-1986), born 10 December 1903 in Toronto. In 1944, he died at home at Lake Macquarie.\n\nIn 1876, at the age of 11, he was apprenticed to a boot maker. In 1884, by the age of 19, Filmer became an assistant telegraph line repairer and operator with the New South Wales Post Office. From 1885 to 1912, he was appointed to the New South Wales Government Railways as telegraph officer. In 1890, Filmer was selected to go to England as a cadet to study railway electrical science and safety. In England he lived with an uncle at the Tower of London. At one point he found himself in charge of the British Royal Train that ran from London to Edinburgh. After completion of railway studies in England in 1891, Filmer returned to New South Wales. With newly acquired knowledge and skills, he received appointment as Electrical Inspector for Railways and remained in that capacity until retirement in 1908.\n\nIn 1909, Filmer was appointed head instructor of electricity for mines at Newcastle Technical College, Maitland Technical College and Cessnock Technical College and taught Applied Electricity. These schools were all mining technical colleges. From 1909 to 1931, he was physics master at Newcastle Technical College, and retired in 1931.\n\n\nFilmer received an appointment as wireless engineer to the Douglas Mawson Expedition to the South Pole, but was unable to accept since the Railway Department would not grant him a release to participate. \nFilmer and his brother Bert Filmer operated one of the first X-ray installation in Australia, three days after cables were received in Australia that announced the discovery of X-rays. From 1896 to 1910, the Filmer brothers were appointed Honorary Electricians at Newcastle Hospital and were X-rays operators at Newcastle Hospital.\n\nFilmer was interested in studies that involved entomology and marine life. He researched parasites, a noteworthy achievement was the discovery of a new family: ‘’Cestoda genera’’, that became known as \"Filmeric\". He had an extensive collection of insects, comprising several thousand samples, and perhaps one of the leading private collections at the time. Filmer developed a keen interest in field work that involved spiders and teamed with Dr. Jiří Baum of the Prague Museum, the Czech zoologist and a leading world authority on spiders. Filmer performed research with Dr. Robin Tillyard on fossil insects. He also teamed with John Mitchell, of Newcastle, on fossil trilobites, and was honored with a species being named after him.\n\nIn 1930, Filmer collected 3 cestodes at Tuggerah from a fresh water tortoise, \"Chelodina longicollis\", and submitted these to the South Australian Museum for identification. Thomas Harvey Johnston reported that this was the first known occurrence for an \"Amphilinid\" to be collected in the Southern Hemisphere, and the only known instance of a member of the order in a reptile, the other known species described, one example from sturgeons in the Northern Hemisphere, two from a primitive fresh-water fish from northern South America, and one from a marine fish off the coast of Ceylon.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Filmer is credited in the animalia and insecta world with species named in his honor for significant contributions.\n\nAustralia is one of the few countries to recognize a group of people for a major achievement where the group happened to work independently in different locations in Australia. These significant achievements by 3 individuals are disputed even to this day. Not the historical fact that the events occurred, but the claim of who accomplished what first, and who should receive credit for being the first in Australia to perform medical radiography. Australia Post decided a fair way was to depict all three individuals on a postage stamp, issued to coincided and commemorate the 100th anniversary of Wilhelm Röntgen’s discovery of X-rays. On 7 September 1995, Father Joseph Patrick Slattery, Thomas Lyle, and Walter Drowley Filmer were recognized as the pioneers of X-ray technology in Australia.\n"}
{"id": "804203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=804203", "title": "Wish", "text": "Wish\n\nA wish is a hope or desire for something. Fictionally, wishes can be used as plot devices. In folklore, opportunities for \"making a wish\" or for wishes to \"come true\" or \"be granted\" are themes that are sometimes used.\n\nIn fiction a wish is a supernatural demand placed on the recipient's unlimited request. When it is the center of a tale, the wish is usually a template for a morality tale, \"be careful what you wish for\"; it can also be a small part of a tale, in which case it is often used as a plot device. One can wish on many things for example: wishing wells, dandelions when one blows the seeds or light them on fire, stars and much more. When one wishes in a well he or she throws money in, in the hope his or her wish comes true, the money normally goes to a charity. \n\nA template for fictional wishes could be \"The Book of One Thousand and One Nights\", specifically the tale of Aladdin, although in the tale of Aladdin the actual wishes were only part of the tale. Also, Aladdin's demands, while outrageous, were mainly variations on wealth (which is still often taken as the most common request).\n\nClassically the wish provider is often a spirit, genie, or similar entity, which is bound or constrained within a commonplace object (Aladdin's oil lamp for example) or a container closed with Solomon's seal. Releasing the entity from its constraint, usually by some simple action, allows the object's possessor to make a wish.\n\nThe subservience of the extraordinarily powerful entity to the wisher can be explained in several ways. The entity may be grateful to be free of its constraint and the wish is a thank-you gift. The entity may be bound to obedience by its prison or some other item that the wisher possesses. The entity may, by its nature, be unable to exercise its powers without an initiator.\n\nOther wish providers are a wide variety of, more or less, inanimate objects. W.W. Jacob's Monkey's Paw is an example of this. Piers Anthony puts a spin on this idea in \"Castle Roogna\": a magic ring claims to grant wishes and then claims credit when a wish comes true, apparently from \nthe unaided efforts of the characters—but every wish made on the ring sooner or later comes true.\n\nSome wishes appear to be granted by nothing in particular. Snow White's mother's wish for a beautiful child might have been a coincidence, but the father's wish in \"The Seven Ravens\" transforms his seven sons into ravens, just as the mother's wish in \"The Raven\" transforms her daughter. This is common in a tale involving a person, male or female, wishing for a child, even one that is a hedgehog, or a sprig of myrtle, or no bigger than a hazel nut.\n\nThe number of wishes granted varies. Aladdin had an unlimited number in the original story, but was restricted to three wishes in the 1992 Disney film. As in the Charles Perrault tale \"The Ridiculous Wishes\", three is the most \ncommon, but \nothers may be granted to fit the constraints of the tale. Several authors have spun variations of the wish for more wishes theme, though some disallow this as \ncheating.\n\nIn many stories the \"wording\" of the wish is extremely important. For example, characters often say, \"I wish I was wealthy.\" This wording could be taken \nliterally, the wish granted so that at one time the wisher was (used to be) wealthy but is not any more. Saying, \"I wish to be wealthy\", then because \"to be\" \nrefers to either the present or the future, they would become wealthy.\n\nA common problem is the granter of the wish being either extremely literal or through malice granting the request in a manner designed to cause maximum distress (such as a request for wealth being granted through inheritance/insurance on the death of a loved one). Certain authors have also tried an \"always on\" approach: the careless use of the word \"wish\" in everyday conversation having, often unpleasant, consequences.\n\nSome cultures have customs in which people are encouraged to \"make a wish\", such as blowing out the candles on a birthday cake, seeing a \nshooting star at night, tossing a coin into a wishing well or fountain or breaking the wishbone of a cooked turkey. Many believe such wishes can only come true if they are kept a secret from other people. Others, on the other hand, believe that wishes come true only if they are told to someone else.\n\n"}
