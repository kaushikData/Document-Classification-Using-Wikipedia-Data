Its scale was greater than all four of the notorious literati purges combined. At that time Joseon politics was dominated by conflict between Eastern and Western factions. Neo-Confucian scholar and Easterner Jeong Yeo-rip was accused of high treason, after which as many as 1,000 Easterners were killed or exiled. (\"Oksa\" means a major case involving high treason in Korean, and there were several events named oksa during the Joseon period.)\n\nThere is still much dispute about the Treason Case of 1589 because there is a wealth of conflicting historical accounts written by both factions. In the Annals of Joseon Dynasty, the official royal record of the Joseon Dynasty, the Seonjo Annals were written by the Easterners (who held power in Gwanghaegun's reign during which it was written) while the Revised Seonjo Annals were written by the Westerners who later seized power with a coup d'état that placed Injo on throne. In \"Yeonryeoshil Records\", unofficial history compiled by Yi Geung-don much later, Yi included accounts of the both sides and marked them in different colors to identify them as such.\n\nDuring King Seonjo's reign, the Sarim scholars following the Kim Jong-jik's school of Neo-Confucianism seized power after long period of perseuction and purges. However, generational difference soon emerged within the Sarim faction - older generation who entered politics during predecessor Myeongjong's reign and younger generation who became officials during Seonjo's time. Their difference was reflected in their attitude toward Shim Eui-gyeom, Myeongjong's brother-in-law. The Sarim tended to regard the king's maternal relatives as corrupting influence on the court and best to be excluded from politics. But older generation, which came to be called the Westerners because Shim's house was on the west of the palace, supported Shim for being Yi Hwang's disciple and protecting them from yet another purge of Sarim that had been planned by his uncle. However, younger generation, called Esterners because its leader Kim Hyo-won's house was on the east of the palace, regarded Shim and older Sarim officials partly responsible for excesses of Myeongjong's reign, which was notorious for corruption and abuse of Yoon Won-hyeong, Myeong's maternal uncle. Philosophically, Easterners tended to be followers of Yi Hwang and Jo Shik while the Westerners followed Yi I and Seong Hun.\n\nThis division was soon brought to conflict, however, mainly because of personal grudge between Shim and Kim. When a key position in Ministry of Personnel became vacant and Kim was recommended by the predecessor, Shim opposed Kim's appointment claiming that Kim was Yoon Wong-hyeong's hanger-on. There could be no greater insult to a Sarim scholar. Kim, who was nevertheless appointed to the position, later opposed Shim's younger brother being appointed to the same position as his successor. \nYi I attempted to prevent the factional split by appointing Shim Eui-gyeom and Kim Hyo-won to provincial posts away from the court and tried to arrange truce between Easterner Yi Bal and Westerner Jeong Cheol. After Yi I's death, however, the conflict between two factions became more intense as the Easterners impeached Shim Eui-gyeom, leading to his dismissal, and gained upper hand.\n\nAs the Easterners began to take key positions, Jeong Yeo-rip changed his affiliation from the Western to Eastern faction and criticized his teacher Yi I after his death, earning hatred and contempt of the Westerners as well as Seonjo, who greatly respected Yi I. Jeong left the court and went back to his hometown where he formed a private society with his supporters. Called Great Common Society (대동계), anyone could join the society regardless of one's social status or gender, and they met each month to socialize together as well as study and also undergo military training. It was not a secret society as it helped defeat the Japanese marauders at the local government's request in one occasion. The society spread throughout Honam region (today's Jeolla) and even beyond. One day a government official in Hwanghae province reported to King Seonjo that there was conspiracy for rebellion in his areas and that their leader was Jeong Yeo-rip.\n\nThere is still a great deal of dispute whether Jeong was conspiring to rebel or whether it was a frame up concocted by the Westerners. There is also a dispute about the nature and purpose of Great Common Society. Jeong supposedly said, \"the world is something to be shared and therefore there cannot be one master.\" He argued that the world belonged to the people, and whoever chosen by them was the king. Jeong's philosophy reflected a desire for classless society, opposition to hereditary monarchy, and possibly even republicanism. Such revolutionary ideas and presence of armed supporters could not help but attract attention of his enemies. For a long time in Korean history, Jeong Yeo-rip's rebellion has been accepted as a fact even by the Easterners, but some historians note that there was no evidence except confessions from tortured followers and letters and writings discovered in his house, which could have been forged.\n\nWhat is undisputed is that Jeong Yeo-rip's supposed rebellion led to a widespread purge of countless Easterners who had nothing to do with Jeong and died terrible deaths as a result. Jeong Cheol, head of the Western faction and a famous poet whose poems are still studied in Korean schools, was in charge of investigating the case and used the case to purge Easterners who had slightest connection with Jeong Yeo-rip. It was said that even a man who shed tears because dust entered his eyes (when Jeong Yeo-rip's body was mutilated after his suicide) was killed for suspected sympahty for Jeong Yeo-rip.\n\nAccording to some accounts, the origin of Treason Case of 1589 goes back to the Third Literati Purge of 1519 during Jungjong's reign and the resulting grudge between two families. After Sarim's head Jo Gwang-jo was executed on framed charges in 1519, Right State Councillor Ahn Dang was dismissed for supporting Jo and his followers, among whom were his sons. In 1521, Song Saryeon, Ahn’s family slave who rose to become a government official of senior fifth rank under Ahn Dang’s patronage, reported to King Jungjong that Ahn Dang’s son was conspiring to kill Chief State Councillor Nam Gon and Shim Jeong, instigators of the Third Literati Purge of 1519. He presented a guest list for funeral of Ahn’s wife as the evidence of conspirators’ meeting. At least a dozen Sarim scholars including Ahn Dang and his family were killed in this event, called False Treason Case of 1521 (\"Shinsa muok\"·신사무옥), and Song Saryeon was rewarded with promotion to high rank and Ahn family’s entire possession.\n\nOne of his sons was Song Yik-pil, who became a scholar of such renown that he formed friendship with Yi I and leading Westerners who praised that his achievement was enough to cover his father’s crimes. It is remarkable indeed that Song Yik-pil overcame the fact that his father not only betrayed his master and benefactor, which would be considered one of the worst sins in Confucian world, but caused one of purges against the Sarim scholars, especially Jo Gwang-jo’s supporters. By Seonjo’s reign, the Sarim faction took control of the government and Jo Gwang-jo and Ahn family were fully rehabilitated as their martyrs.\n\nHowever, some hardline Easterners saw Song Yik-pil as the mastermind behind the Westerners and instigated the descendants of Ahn Dang to seek justice and punishment for Song Saryeon, who was then deceased after enjoying thirty years of power and wealth. After an reinvestigation in 1586, it was determined that Ahn Dang and others were falsely accused by Song Saryoen and over 70 family members of Song Saryeon including Song Yik-pil were enslaved and given to Ahn family as compensation. Facing certain revenge from aggrieved Ahn family, the Song family scattered and became fugitives. Song Yik-pil, who turned from a respected scholar to fugitive slave overnight, hid himself by secretly staying with leaders of the Westerners such as Jeong Cheol, his disciple and famous scholar Kim Jang-saeng, and even an Easterner like Yi San-hae. According to some accounts, it was while Song Yik-pil was in Hwanghae area that the accusation of treason was made against Jeong Yeo-rip, who lived in Honam. During the whole period when Jeong Cheol was in charge of investigating the treason case and interrogated the Easterners, Song Yik-pil was said to be staying with Jeong Cheol.\n\nWhen the accusation against Jeong Yeo-rip was first made, the Easterners held key positions and were in charge of investigating the case. The Easterners told Seonjo that Jeong Yeo-rip could not possibly be plotting a rebellion when Jeong unexpectedly committed suicide, which was considered the admission of guilt. The Westerners accused the Easterners of being half-hearted in pursuing the case, and Seonjo promoted hardline Westerner Jeong Cheol as Right State Councillor and put him in charge of investigation despite Jeong Cheol's initial refusal. Soon afterward, Jeong Yeo-rip's nephew began to mention names of the Easterners including Left State Councillor Jeong Eon Shin, hardliner Yi Bal, and many others (It was customary to use to torture when interrogating prisoners). Their denial of being close to Jeong Yeo-rip angered Seonjo since many of their letters were found in Jeong's house, some of which were critical of the king and his rule. (It was said that Jeong Eon Shin was told by his men that his letters with Jeong were destroyed, but they only destroyed ones that directly mentioned his name and not nicknames. When Jeong Eon Shin denied exchanging letters with Jeong Yeo-rip, Seonjo angrily asked, \"Does he think I have no eyes?\" pointing to 19 letters in which they discussed state affairs.) Jeong Cheol asked for leniency with Jeong Eun Shin, Yi Bal, and others claiming that they could not know Jeong Yeo-rip's evil side, but the Easterners claim that Jeong Cheol sought to destroy them while appearing to try to save them on the outside. Indeed, Yi Bal and his brother, Choe Young-gyeong (greatly respected scholar of Yeongnam School), and many others died in prison of torture or illness. (Jeong Cheol's animosity with Yi Bal was such that he even spat on him in one occasion.) Even Yi Bal's 80-year-old mother and 8-year-old son were killed (although Jeong Cheol supposedly opposed it). The treason case went on for three years, and 1,000 people were killed or exiled. (According to some accounts, the death toll was 1,000.)\n\nHowever, it was Seonjo who probably played a greater role than anyone else in turning Jeong Yeo-rip's treason case to widespread purge that it became. Sarim's division strengthened the king's power, and the purge was focused on hardline Easterners (Jeong Yeo-rip, Yi Bal) as opposed to moderate Easterners (Yi San-hae, Yu Seong-ryong) who came out unscathed. Hardline Easterners were the most radical of the Sarim factions. In contrast, Yi San-hae and Yu Seong-ryong were protected by Seonjo when their names came up in the treason case. Later Seonjo would blame Jeong Cheol for excesses of Treason Case of 1589.\n\nThe Treason Case of 1589 is significant as the moment when the conflict within Sarim faction was irrevocably marred with bad blood, becoming struggle of life and death that characterized much periods of Joseon politics. The Eastern faction was further split between hardline Northerners and moderate Southerners over the question of punishing Jeong Cheol and other Westerners. The Northern faction came on top and continued the cycle of revenge for earlier wrongs. The Treason Case of 1589 is also blamed for Joseon's unpreparedness and poor showing in the Japanese Invasion of 1592 three years later. Some historians blame Treason Case of 1589 for the subsequent discrimination against Honam region as land of rebellion, whose effect is still felt today. It is also remembered today for Jeong Yeo-rip's revolutionary ideas ahead of its time.\n"}

{"id": "1551078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1551078", "title": "Altes Museum", "text": "Altes Museum\n\nThe Altes Museum (German for Old Museum) is a museum building on Museum Island in Berlin, Germany. Since restoration work in 2010–11, it houses the \"Antikensammlung\" (antiquities collection) of the Berlin State Museums. The museum building was built between 1823 and 1830 by the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel in the neoclassical style to house the Prussian royal family's art collection. The historic, protected building counts among the most distinguished in neoclassicism and is a high point of Schinkel's career. Until 1845, it was called the \"Königliches Museum\" (Royal Museum). Along with the other museums and historic buildings on Museum Island, the Altes Museum was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, Germany's bourgeoisie had become increasingly self-aware and self-confident. This growing class began to embrace new ideas regarding the relationship between itself and art, and the concepts that art should be open to the public and that citizens should be able to have access to a comprehensive cultural education began to pervade society. King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia was a strong proponent of this humboldtian ideal for education and charged Karl Friedrich Schinkel with planning a public museum for the royal art collection.\n\nSchinkel's plans for the \"Königliches Museum\", as it was then known, were also influenced by drafts of the crown prince, later King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, who desired a building that was heavily influenced by antiquity. The crown prince even sent Schinkel a pencil sketch of a large hall adorned with a classical portico.\n\nSchinkel's plans incorporated the \"Königliches Museum\" into an ensemble of buildings, which surround the \"Berliner Lustgarten\" (pleasure garden). The \"Stadtschloss\" in the south was a symbol of worldly power, the \"Zeughaus\" in the west represented military might, and the \"Berliner Dom\" in the east was the embodiment of divine authority. The museum to the north of the garden, which was to provide for the education of the people, stood as a symbol for science and art—and not least for their torchbearer: the self-aware bourgeoisie.\n\nSchinkel had developed plans for the \"Königliches Museum\" as early as 1822/23, but construction did not begin until 1825. Construction was completed in 1828 and the museum was inaugurated on 3 August 1830. Schinkel was also responsible for the renovation of the \"Berliner Dom\" in the neo-classical style (which was originally a \"baroque\" cathedral), and he exercised considerable influence on Peter Joseph Lenné's renovation of the \"Lustgarten\", which coincided with the construction of the museum, resulting in a harmonized and integrated ensemble.\n\nIn 1841, King Friedrich Wilhelm IV announced in a royal decree, that the entire northern part of the Spree Island (now known as Museum Island) \"be transformed into a sanctuary for art and science.\" In 1845, with the completion of the \"Neues Museum\", the \"New Museum\", the \"Königliches Museum\" was renamed the \"Altes Museum\", the name it holds to this day.\n\nThe royally appointed commission, which was responsible for the conception of the museum, decided to display only \"High Art\" in the proposed building which included Old Master paintings and prints and drawings on the upper floor, as well as Classical sculpture from ancient Greece and Rome on the ground floor. This precluded the incorporation of ethnography, prehistory and the excavated treasures of the ancient Near East from Assyria and Persia (and elsewhere); instead, these artifacts were primarily housed in Schloss Monbijou.\n\nWith the completion of the \"Neues Museum\" (New Museum) by Friedrich August Stüler in 1855, Museum Island began to take form. This was followed by the \"Nationalgalerie\" (now the \"Alte Nationalgalerie\") by Johann Heinrich Strack (1876), the \"Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum\" (now the Bodemuseum) by Ernst von Ihne after plans by Stüler (1904), and the Pergamonmuseum by Alfred Messel and Ludwig Hoffmann (1930). Thus Museum Island evolved into the institution it is today.\n\nJulius Carl Raschdorff's 1894–1905 reconstruction of the \"Berliner Dom\" into a neo-Renaissance cathedral (replacing the classical cathedral designed by Schinkel) severely disrupted the classical ensemble, especially since the new cathedral has significantly larger dimensions than its predecessor.\n\nDuring National Socialism, the Altes Museum was used as the backdrop for propaganda, both in the museum itself and upon the parade grounds of the redesigned \"Lustgarten\". Just before the end of Second World War, the museum was badly damaged when a tank truck exploded in front of the museum, and the frescoes designed by Schinkel and Peter Cornelius, which adorned the vestibule and the back wall of the portico, were largely lost.\n\nUnder General Director Ludwig Justi, the building was the first museum of Museum Island to undergo reconstruction and restoration, which was carried out from 1951 to 1966 by Hans Erich Bogatzky and Theodor Voissen. Following Schinkel's designs, the murals of the rotunda were restored in 1982. However, neither the ornate ceilings of the ground floor exhibition rooms nor the pairs of columns under the girders were reconstructed. The former connection to the \"Neues Museum\" has also not been rebuilt; instead, an underground passageway connecting all of the museums of Museum Island is planned as part of the \"Museumsinsel 2015\" renovations.\n\nThe Altes Museum was originally constructed to house all of the city's collections of fine arts, including Old Master paintings, and prints and drawings. However, since 1904, the museum has solely housed the \"Antikensammlung\" (Collection of Classical Antiquities). Since 1998, the Collection of Classical Antiquities has displayed its Greek collection, including the treasury, on the ground floor of the Altes Museum. Special exhibitions are displayed on the second floor of the museum.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5683113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5683113", "title": "American Splendor (film)", "text": "American Splendor (film)\n\nAmerican Splendor is a 2003 American biographical comedy-drama film about Harvey Pekar, the author of the \"American Splendor\" comic book series. The film is also in part an adaptation of the comics, which dramatize Pekar's life. The film was written and directed by documentarians Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini.\n\nThe film stars Paul Giamatti as Pekar and Hope Davis as Joyce Brabner. It also features appearances from Pekar and Brabner themselves (along with Toby Radloff), who discuss their lives, the comic books, and how it feels to be depicted onscreen by actors. It was filmed entirely on location in Cleveland and Lakewood in Ohio.\n\n\nThough Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini had directed documentaries before, \"American Splendor\" was their first narrative feature. Of the film's alternating of fictional portrayals with real-life appearances by Pekar and his friends and family, co-writer/co-director Pulcini recalled, \"It really was the only way that made sense to tell that story because we were handed this stack of comic strips where the main character never really looks the same because he’s drawn by so many different artists. We wondered how to stay true to the material, and that’s the concept we came up with. The structure came out of that very naturally. It wasn’t something that we labored over.\" Berman added that upon meeting Pekar they felt compelled to include him in the film. \"We also got to know Harvey even before we wrote the screenplay. We actually went to Cleveland and spent time with Harvey and Joyce, and spoke to them on the phone a lot. Once we spent some time with both of them, we were like, “Oh my God, we have to put them in the movie!” That was a case where we were still using our documentary instincts and had to figure out a way to include him in it that was a natural fit for the material.\" At one point, Pekar meta-references the structure of the film by doing a voice-over for a one-shot of Paul Giamatti playing him by saying \"There's our guy. Well, it's me. Or the guy playing me. Though he don't look nothing like me, but whatever.\" David Letterman refused to appear in the film or allow the filmmakers to use footage of Pekar's disastrous final appearance on this show (though he had no problems with the earlier Pekar \"Late Night\" appearances that are shown), so that final appearance was done using oblique camera angles and a voiced-over audio of the incident.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 94% approval rating, based on 185 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exhilarating both stylistically and for its entertaining, moving portrayal of an everyman, \"American Splendor\" is a portrait of a true underground original.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 42 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\"\n\n\"American Splendor\" won the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Film at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, in addition to the award for Best Adapted Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America. At the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, the film received the FIPRESCI critics award. It was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 2003 Academy Awards.\n\nColumnist Jaime Wolf wrote a laudatory review of the film in \"Slate\", also drawing attention to formal parallels with Woody Allen's \"Annie Hall\" and other Allen films.\n\nPekar wrote about the effects of the film in \"American Splendor: Our Movie Year\".\n\nBoston Society of Film Critics\n\nChicago Film Critics Association\n\nLos Angeles Film Critics Association\n\nNational Society of Film Critics\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle\n\nSundance Film Festival\n\nWriters Guild of America (WGA)\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nBelgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics\n\nChicago Film Critics Association\n\nGolden Globe Awards\n\nSatellite Awards\n\n"}

{"id": "54722244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54722244", "title": "Armed Peasant Association", "text": "Armed Peasant Association\n\nThe Armed Peasant Association (, short ACA, less commonly Armed Campesino Group) is a leftist rebel group that takes part in the insurgency in Paraguay. Formed in 2014 as splinter faction of the Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) by two brothers, Albino and Alfredo Jara Larrea, ACA began to decline almost immediately after its foundation as result of repeated raids and arrests by the Paraguayan security forces. After the death of most of its members and leaders in 2016, the group became defunct. It was refounded in 2017, however, by two sisters of the Jara Larrea brothers and a former member of the \"Army of Marshal López\", another insurgent group.\n\nThe formation of ACA was the result of dissent among the EPP. One of the rebel group's columns which was led by the Jara Larrea brothers had long harbored resentment for the EPP central leadership, allegedly because the brothers had been berated for their indiscipline, including drunkenness, partying, looting and womanizing. After the Larrea faction received a ransom of over one million Paraguayan guaraní (over $230,000) in June 2014 for a kidnapped businessman from Yby Yau, the group had enough funds to become independent. In September 2014, the Larrea brothers and their followers fully broke away from the EPP and formed the Armed Peasant Association; the group was initially believed to have around 13 members.\n\nAccording to the government, ACA modeled itself on the Colombian FARC and wanted to become involved in the illegal drug trade in Paraguay through taxation or extortion of marijuana farmers; an expert from \"InSight Crime\" considered this assumption likely, as one ACA member, Rubén Darío López Fernández, was known to have close links with the First Catarinense Group, a Brazilian crime group.\n\nSoon after ACA's foundation, however, the group was targeted by the Paraguayan security forces in course of several raids between 19 and 21 September, with around five ACA fighters killed. Having thus lost about a third of its strength, including the \"key fighter\" Marcos Ojeda, ACA was already seriously weakened just after its conception. This quick weakening suggested that ACA lacked \"the level of professionalism\" and civilian support that EPP enjoyed. ACA's decline continued afterwards, and already on 5 January 2015 the Joint Task Force managed to corner the group east of Concepción. In course of the following shootout Albino Jara Larrea was killed and several other militants injured, further reducing ACA's fighting strength. In an attempt to replenish its numbers, ACA recruited child soldiers; there were also accounts that some female child soldiers married older ACA fighters.\n\nAfter Albino's death, his brother Alfredo became the group's new leader. Under his command, ACA apparently began to work closely with the EPP, leading experts to consider the possibility that ACA, weakened by their many losses, might fully rejoin the EPP. In the end, however, ACA remained officially independent. Eventually, the group managed to kidnap police sergeant Idilio Morínigo and Mennonite settler Abraham Fehr in order to hold them for ransom, but its demise continued. On 9 September, security forces captured the faction's alleged logistics chief, Daniel Rivarola Areco, and in November 2015 the Joint Task Force launched a devastating raid against ACA's headquarters at the border of the Concepción and Amambay Departments. In course of this operation, which was later characterized by Interior Minister Francisco de Vargas as \"the most successful\" yet during the Paraguayan counter-insurgency campaign, most of ACA's leadership was killed: Namely Alfredo Jara Larrea, second-in-command Mariano López Velázquez (\"alias\" \"Fredi Romero\"), and third-in-command Ovelar González (\"alias\" \"Beto Gimenez\").\n\nAt this point, ACA had already mostly ceased to exist, but remnants of the group remained active. On 17 May 2016, the new ACA commander, Idilio Morínigo, was killed by government forces; this caused a dispute among his surviving followers, who could not agree how to share the 260-300 million guaraní that Morínigo had in his possession when he died. As result, one ACA fighter shot one of his comrades dead and fled with all of the money.\n\nIn December 2016, four ACA militants stormed the Silva Smith hacienda in the Concepción Department, and took the family and its employees hostage, demanding 300 million guaraní for their release. Eventually, however, the ACA fighters became nervous about a possible attack by the Joint Task Force, freed the hostages and left without further violence. In March 2017, Paraguayan security forces arrested several men and women, including relatives of the deceased Jara Larrea brothers, who were suspected to be connected to the ACA or EPP. In late May, government forces arrested a man who was believed to be one of the hostage takers of the previous December.\n\nOn 22 July 2017, two cousins of Albino and Alfredo Jara Larrea, namely Rodrigo and J. Argüello Larrea, disappeared in the Concepción Department. As the police investigated the area where they had last been seen, they found traces of a militant camp, suggesting that the two had been abducted. Just a few days before this incident, the vigilante self-defense group \"Justicieros de la Frontera\" had kidnapped the sister-in-law of Alejandro Ramos, another Leftist rebel leader.\n\nSometime before October 2017, the Armed Peasant Association was refounded by Feliciano Bernal Maíz, a Leftist militant who had been expelled by the \"Army of Marshal López\" insurgent group, and two sisters of Albino and Alfredo Jara Larrea, namely Zulma and Emiliana Jara Larrea. The first known action of the new Armed Peasant Association was a raid on the \"La Novia\" ranch on 10 October 2017. The group's members, of unknown number, operate as part-time insurgents, stealing and extorting farms during periodic raids and then returning to civilian life.\n"}

She claimed the photographing was a violation of her right to privacy under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The Court held that under Quebec law a photographer can take photographs in public places but may not publish the picture unless permission has been obtained from the subject.\n\nThe Court limited this requirement to exclude persons whose photographs were taken during an event of public interest. That is, a person of public interest or equally an unknown person who is implicated in a public matter cannot claim image rights. Consequently, anyone whose photograph was incidental to a photo of some matter will be treated as part of the background and will not be able to claim their rights were violated.\n\nPhotojournalist and photographers groups took issue with the decision, arguing that it had the potential to create a chilling effect on their profession. Justice Bastarache later referred to the case in \"Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem\" (2004), to discuss how the Quebec Charter is relevant to personal disputes. The photo became part of the public domain since it was handed to the Supreme Court.\n\n\n"}

Microsoft's spokesperson stated that the beta testing was intended to obtain an insight into user behavior and the data would be incorporated into plans for future products. It was stated that user-created content from Windows Live Shopping beta (lists, guides, and reviews) would continue to be available on MSN Shopping. \"Windows Live Shopping Guides\" was discontinued as part of the rebranding.\n\nAs MSN Shopping, the service aggregated millions of product offers from thousands of retailers, allowing users to search or browse for products. Searches could be sorted by relevance, popularity or by price (either ascending or descending). Refinements were available to allow the user to narrow the results set.\n\nOn August 23, 2013 Bing announced that it would replace Bing Shopping with Product Search which integrates product results within Bing search results instead of linking to a separate webpage.\n\nBing Cashback was a loyalty program which allowed users to search for products from multiple vendors and find their prices and offering money back for purchases made through the site. It was originally started in June 2006 by Jellyfish.com. On October 2, 2007, Microsoft announced it was purchasing Jellyfish.com for an estimated price of $50 million, with the intent of using the Jellyfish engine as part of their Live Search services in attempt to catch up to Google in the search market.\n\nThe cashback service was officially announced as \"Live Search Cashback\" on May 22, 2008. From December 1, 2008, it began offering users to receive cashbacks instantly, instead of having to wait for 60 days. This feature only worked in conjunction with eBay.\n\nMicrosoft officially merged Cashback with the rest of the Live Search products on April 14, 2009, later renaming it to Bing Cashback on June 3, 2009 as part of the its rebranding of Live Search to Bing. On June 4, 2010, Microsoft announced that Bing Cashback would be retired on July 30, 2010 due to lack of interest.\n\n"}

{"id": "25587098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25587098", "title": "CANaerospace", "text": "CANaerospace\n\nCANaerospace is a higher layer protocol based on Controller Area Network (CAN) which has been developed by Stock Flight Systems in 1998 for aeronautical applications.\n\nCANaerospace supports airborne systems employing the Line-replaceable unit (LRU) concept to share data across CAN and ensures interoperability between CAN LRUs by defining CAN physical layer characteristics, network layers, communication mechanisms, data types and aeronautical axis systems. CANaerospace is an open source project, was initiated to standardize the interface between CAN LRUs on the system level. CANaerospace is continuously being developed further and has also been published by NASA as the Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiments Databus Standard in 2001. It found widespread use in aeronautical research worldwide. A major research aircraft that employs several CANaerospace networks for real-time computer interconnection is the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), a Boeing 747SP with a 2.5m astronomic telescope. CANaerospace is also frequently used in flight simulation and connects entire aircraft cockpits (i.e. in Eurofighter Typhoon simulators) to the simulation host computers. In Italy CANaerospace is used as UAV data bus technology. Furthermore, CANaerospace serves as communication network in several general aviation avionics systems.\n\nThe CANaerospace interface definition closes the gap between the ISO/OSI layer 1 and 2 CAN protocol (which is implemented in the CAN controller itself) and the specific requirements of distributed systems in aircraft. It may be used as a primary or ancillary avionics network and was designed to meet the following requirements:\n\n\nTo ensure interoperability and reliable communication, CANaerospace specifies the electrical characteristics, bus transceiver requirements and data rates with the corresponding tolerances based on ISO 11898. The bit timing calculation (baud rate accuracy, sample point definition) and robustness to electromagnetic interference are given special emphasis. Also addressed are CAN connector, wiring considerations and design guidelines to maximize electromagnetic compatibility.\n\nThe Bosch CAN specification itself allows messages being transmitted both periodically and aperiodically but does not cover issues like data representation, node addressing or connection-oriented protocols. CAN is entirely based on Anyone-to-Many (ATM) communication which means that CAN messages are always received by all stations in the network. The advantage of the CAN concept is inherent data consistency between all stations, the drawback is that it does not allow node addressing which is the basis for Peer-to-Peer (PTP) communication. Using CAN networks in aeronautical applications, however, demands a standard targeted to the specific requirements of airborne systems which implies that communication between individual stations in the network must be possible to enable the required degree of system monitoring. Consequently, CANaerospace defines additional ISO/OSI layer 3, 4 and 6 functions to support node addressing and unified ATM/PTP communication mechanisms. PTP communication allows to set up client/server interactions between individual stations in the network either temporarily or permanently. More than one of these interactions may be in effect at any given time and each node may be client for one operation and server for another at the same time. This CANaerospace mechanism is called \"Node Service Concept\" and allows i.e. to distribute system functions over several stations in the network or to control dynamic system reconfiguration in case of failure. The Node Service concept supports both connection-oriented and connectionless interactions like with TCP/IP and UDP/IP for Ethernet.\n\nEnabling both ATM and PTP communication for CAN requires the introduction of independent network layers to isolate the different types of communication. This is realized for CANaerospace by forming CAN identifier groups as shown in Figure 1. The resulting structure creates Logical Communication Channels (LCCs) and assigns a specific communication type (ATM, PTP) to each of the LCCs. User-defined LCCs provide the necessary freedom for designers and allow the implementation of CANaerospace according to the needs of specific applications.\nFigure 1: Logical Communication Channels for CANaerospace\n\nAs a side effect, the CAN identifier groups in Figure 1 affect the priority of the message transmission in case of bus arbitration. The communication channels are therefore arranged according to their relative importance:\n\n\nThe majority of the real-time control systems used in aeronautics employ \"big endian\" processor architectures. This data representation was therefore specified for CANaerospace as well. With big endian data representation, the most significant bit of any datum is arranged leftmost and transmitted first on CANaerospace as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: \"Big Endian\" Data Representation for CANaerospace\n\nCANaerospace uses a self-identifying message format which is realized by structuring the message payload as shown in Figure 3. This structure defines a 4-byte message header and a 4-byte parameter section.\nFigure 3: CANaerospace Self-Identifying Message Format\n\nOn first sight the use of 50% of the CAN message payload for purposes other than transmitting operational data may seem like a waste of bandwidth. However, the CANaerospace message header delivers valuable information which would require the use of message payload bytes also when realized otherwise: The header allows receiving stations to analyze received messages immediately with respect to origin, data type, integrity and creation time. To accomplish this, no further information except the knowledge of the CAN identifier assignment for the particular system is needed. The message header bytes have the following meaning:\n\n\nThe above information contained in the CANaerospace message header contains important information to determine the integrity of the parameters for the use in flight safety critical systems and supports system redundancy. Additionally, it significantly improves the interoperability between LRUs of different vendors and allows the monitoring of CANaerospace networks concerning the status of the LRUs attached to it. For further interoperability, CANaerospace defines aerospace specific axis systems with the corresponding sign conventions and physical units. Together with the predefined identifier assignment list, these definitions describe the traffic in a CANaerospace network unambiguously. The CANaerospace Standard Identifier Assignment List reserves the CAN identifiers between 300 and 1799 and assigns parameters to them as shown in the excerpt of this list (Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Excerpt from the Standard Identifier Assignment List of CANaerospace V 1.7\n\nSystem designers may use self-defined identifier assignment lists. The mandatory \"Node Identification Service\" which each CANaerospace LRU has to respond to allows to scan the network for attached LRUs and their identifier assignment list code to avoid inconsistencies. The CANaerospace Standard Identifier Assignment List as well as the lists for data types and units provide user-defined sections which may be used by system designers to expand these lists according to their needs.\n\nAn essential characteristic of all flight safety critical systems is that their behavior has to be precisely defined, analyzed and tested to meet formal certification requirements. This characteristic is often misinterpreted as timing determinism but is in fact predictability. The degree of precision required for timing is specific to each\napplication and has to be quantified by system analysis. The ultimate target to be reached, however, is that it may be demonstrated to certification authorities (i.e. FAA, EASA) that a safety critical system behaves predictably under foreseeable circumstances. Using CANaerospace, this predictability may be achieved.\n\nCANaerospace sets forth a concept of managing the available bandwidth of a multi-drop CAN network to ensure predictable behavior for ATM and PTP communication which is called Time Triggered Bus Scheduling. Time Triggered Bus Scheduling is based on a limitation of the number of CAN messages that any node in the network may transmit within a minor time frame. The minor time frame is defined during initial system design. The maximum number of messages transmitted within one minor time frame may differ from node to node and contain growth potential if granted by system design. It is crucial to the Time Triggered Bus Scheduling concept that every node in the network adheres to its transmission schedule at all times when generating network traffic. It is neither required nor prohibited, however, that nodes in the network synchronize to other nodes concerning their message transmission order or transmission times.\n\nCAN error frames may lead to unpredictable behavior if the bandwidth is consumed by error frames resulting from faults of the network or the nodes attached to it. Therefore, CANaerospace recommends to limit the bandwidth usage to 50% of the maximum bandwidth so that unpredictability is mitigated. While Time Triggered Bus Scheduling requires margins and does not optimize network bandwidth usage, it provides a safe and straightforward approach to build certifiable (predictable) systems. For ensuring this under fault conditions the system designer has to define the behaviour under these conditions (error frames and avoidance of priority inversion). Applying the Time Triggered Bus Scheduling concept, it may be demonstrated that a CANaerospace network behaves predictably. Shown in Figure 5 is the transmission schedule of a CANaerospace network with two nodes transmitting their messages asynchronously, in alternating order and at random times within their minor time frames (worst-case scenario). This example utilizes 50% of the maximum bandwidth.\nFigure 5: Simplified CANaerospace Transmission Scheme\n\nUsing Time Triggered Bus Scheduling, no message in this transmission schedule has a latency exceeding 50% of one minor time frame plus the duration of the longest message. Time Triggered Bus Scheduling reduces the effect of message priority due to the fact that the nodes on the network are required to meter their message transmissions.\n\nLocal oscillator tolerances and lack of time synchronization between the nodes will result in minor time frames drifting away from each other. This does not adversely affect message latencies as long as the duration of the minor time frame in all nodes matches closely. To ensure predictability, all aperiodic messages must be included in the bandwidth management calculations.\n\nTime Triggered Bus Scheduling ensures adequate flexibility for increasing network traffic during the lifetime of the system if growth potential is planned. As an example, system design will allow nodes to be integrated into the network without affecting the existing nodes. Furthermore, the predictable behavior enforced by Time Triggered Bus Scheduling allows systems with different criticality levels to coexist on the same network.\n\n"}

{"id": "256003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=256003", "title": "Cerebus the Aardvark", "text": "Cerebus the Aardvark\n\nCerebus (; also Cerebus the Aardvark) is a comic book series created by Canadian cartoonist Dave Sim, which ran from December 1977 until March 2004. The title character of the 300-issue series is an anthropomorphic aardvark who takes on a number of roles throughout the series—barbarian, prime minister and Pope among them. The series stands out for its experimentation in form and content, and for the dexterity of its artwork, especially after background artist Gerhard joined with the 65th issue. As the series progressed, it increasingly became a platform for Sim's controversial beliefs.\n\nThe comic began as a parody of sword and sorcery comics, but explored a variety of other topics, including politics, religion, and gender issues. At a total of 6,000 pages, it progressively became more serious and ambitious than its parodic roots—what has come to be dubbed \"Cerebus Syndrome\". Sim announced early on that the series would end with the death of the title character. The story has a large cast of characters, many of which began as parodies of characters from comic books and popular culture.\n\nStarting with the \"High Society\" storyline, the series became divided into self-contained \"novels\", which form parts of the overall story. The ten \"novels\" of the series have been collected in 16 books, known as \"Cerebus phonebooks\" for their resemblance, by way of their thickness, to telephone directories. At a time when the series was about 70% completed, celebrated comic book writer Alan Moore wrote, \"Cerebus, as if I need to say so, is still to comic books what Hydrogen is to the Periodic Table.\"\n\nCerebus has been rated to be one the greatest characters in comics history. \"Wizard\" rated him as the 63rd greatest comic book character, while \"Empire\" rated him as the 38th greatest comic book character, describing him as a character born of bizarre brilliance. IGN placed Cerebus as the 91st greatest comic book hero of all time, stating that a few names hold as much sway in the independent comics scene as Cerebus and that Cerebus' mark on the industry will be everlasting.\n\n\"Cerebus\" was self-published by Dave Sim under his Aardvark-Vanaheim, Inc. publishing banner. For the first few years the company's publisher was Deni Loubert, Sim's girlfriend (the two would marry and divorce during the comic's run). Sim's position as a pioneering self-publisher in comics inspired numerous writer/artists after him, most notably Jeff Smith (\"Bone\"), Terry Moore (\"Strangers in Paradise\"), and Martin Wagner (\"Hepcats\").\n\nIn 1979, Sim, who was at the time a frequent marijuana user, began using LSD, taking the drug with such frequency that he was eventually hospitalized. It was this incident that Sim claims led to the inspiration to produce \"Cerebus\" for 300 monthly issues. \n\nWhen Sim published the first \"Cerebus\" \"phone book\", a paperback collection of the \"High Society\" graphic novel (issues #26–50), he angered distributors—who felt that their support had been instrumental in his series' success in an industry generally indifferent to small publishers—by offering the first printing via mail order only. The decision was a financial windfall for Sim, however, grossing over $150,000 in sales (). Sim became known for picking up hotel tabs for self-publishers and helping other self-publishers by paying for meals and limo service between stops. Negotiations regarding DC buying \"Cerebus\" took place over the course of 1985 to 1988, offering $100,000 ($ today) and 10% of all licensing and merchandising, which Sim rejected.\n\nThe series hit a personal sales record with issue #100 which, despite being a normal issue in the middle of a story arc, had a print run of 36,000 copies. Sales took a substantial drop over the next 50 issues, however, and Sim commented that the fact that readers could not simply \"jump in\" to \"Cerebus\", and had to read the entire series in order to be able to understand the current issue, was a major reason for the sales drop.\n\nIn July 1984, \"Cerebus\" publisher Aardvark-Vanaheim was threatened with possible legal action by Marvel Comics over a parody of Wolverine in \"Cerebus\".\n\nWhen Sim guest-wrote the 10th issue of Todd McFarlane's comics series \"Spawn\", he donated his entire fee—over $100,000—to the fund.\n\n\"Jaka's Story\", a tragic character study dealing with gender roles and the political suppression of art, is generally cited as the series' pinnacle of narrative achievement. Later issues of the series became highly personal and began to alienate many long-time fans, his female readers especially. Issue #186 (collected in \"Reads\") contained a lengthy prose section that was attacked by some readers and critics for what they perceived as overt misogyny, but which Sim describes as \"anti-feminism\". During this part of the story, the storyline consisted of a textual treatise written by Viktor Davis, a fictional \"reads\" author, interspersed with the main \"Cerebus\" storyline. In Davis' material, he refers to the \"creative male light\" and the \"emotional female void\", a reversal of the gender-based view of creation espoused by the Judge at the end of \"Church and State\" (namely, the \"female light\" being raped by the \"male void\" and shattering into the physical universe). As Sim himself says in an interview with \"The Comics Journal\", \"\"Cerebus\" #1–200 [is] the completion of the story. The yin and yang. The ultra-female reading. The ultra-male reading. I'm attaching an allegory to the Big Bang. You make up your mind which one's the pit and which one's the top of the mountain.\" By the end of the series, the Void is again male and identified as God, and the Light is female, now identified with YHWH. Issue #186 was followed by another essay in the back of issue #265 called \"Tangent\", in which Sim identified a \"feminist/homosexualist axis\" that opposed traditional and rational societal values. This material appeared as Sim was retreating from public life and becoming more marginalized by his peers in the industry.\n\nSim himself appeared as a character in \"Cerebus\", as when he berated the title character in the \"Minds\" story arc.\n\nSim's religious beliefs heavily influenced the last third of \"Cerebus\"'s storyline. Once an atheist, Sim became a believer in God while gathering research material for \"Rick's Story\". However, rather than following an established religion, Sim follows his own personal belief system cobbled together from elements of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, although he described himself in issue #8 of \"Following Cerebus\" as \"mostly Muslim\". A 2003 magazine interview describes Sim as reciting a prayer of his own devising five times a day (which was published in the back of issue #300), and as having sold much of his furniture to donate the money to charity as an act of religious asceticism. In an editorial contained in issue #297, Sim stated that he regards the production of \"Cerebus\" as of secondary importance to his religious practice. Sim's religious beliefs tie into his views on gender, and the bulk of the \"Cerebus\" storyline after \"Guys\" deals with this, especially \"Rick's Story\", \"Latter Days\", and \"The Last Day\".\n\nA quarterly publication, \"Following Cerebus\", followed in August 2004, featuring correspondence, essays, and previously unpublished artwork from Sim, as well as interviews with other comic writers and artists.\n\nSim was rumored to have said that had he died or otherwise chosen not to complete \"Cerebus\" prior to issue 300, the remaining issues were to either consist of blank pages or Gerhard was to have drawn his backgrounds only, leaving Sim's contribution blank. It is not known if this plan was ever serious, since it was never put into effect. At the completion of the series, Sim directed that upon his and Gerhard's death, \"Cerebus\" would enter into the public domain. Effective 31 December 2006, Sim purchased Gerhard's share of the company. Sim has already granted a general license for other creators to use his characters in their own works, stating that he is trying to be consistent with his own appropriation of others' works.\n\nIn early 2009, Sim launched the bimonthly series \"Cerebus Archive\". It was translated into Italian; and in 2011, \"Church & State Vol. I\" was published in Spanish.\n\nThis first story arc, uniquely in this series, consists of one to three-issue storylines with only occasional back-references. Cerebus is introduced as an amoral barbarian mercenary, fighting (and betraying) for money and drinking it away. During his adventures, he encounters the warrior Pigts (whose religion reveres aardvarks) and the insane wizard Necross, who turns himself into a giant stone Thrunk (visually similar to Marvel Comics' The Thing). Most of the series' prominent characters are introduced (or at least mentioned) in these issues, including Elrod of Melvinbone (a parodic representation of Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone), Lord Julius, a character based upon Groucho Marx, Artemis Roach (a.k.a. The Roach) and Jaka. The series takes a sharp change in direction with issue #20 which is the first of the \"Mind Games\" issues that are a feature of the comic and introduces the philosophical Suenteus Po and the ultra-matriarchial Cirinists.\n\nCerebus comes to the wealthy city-state of Iest as the representative of Lord Julius's city-state of Palnu. He quickly finds himself enmeshed in the fast-paced world of high finance and politics, and comic tension is built through his ignorance of the \"high society\" machinations going on around him. Cerebus is befriended by the legendary Regency Elf as he adjusts to his new circumstances. He meets and soon finds himself maneuvered into a political campaign by the mysterious Astoria, who is also manipulating Artemis into pseudo-super hero identities that are parodies of Moon Knight and later Sergeant Preston of the Mounties. Cerebus recognizes that he is a pawn in a political game between Lord Julius and Astoria, but he struggles to assert himself and ultimately confounds the expectations of everyone attempting to use him. Cerebus is eventually elected Prime Minister of Iest, but launches an unnecessary war of conquest that causes him to lose everything.\n\nAfter some travels, Cerebus returns to Iest and is manipulated by Weisshaupt, who wants to use Cerebus's popularity with the masses, into again becoming Prime Minister of Iest. Weisshaupt has maneuvered himself into the tenuous presidency of a federation of states (including Iest, Palnu and New Sepra) as a bulwark against the Cirinists. Weisshaupt lures Cerebus into a drunken marriage to Red Sophia, but ultimately loses his influence over Cerebus when Weisshaupt's rival, Bishop Powers, appoints Cerebus Pope of the Eastern Church of Tarim. Finally out from under anyone else's control, Cerebus lets absolute power go to his head and demands that all the citizens must give him all their gold or face the end of the world. Sophia walks out on Cerebus, and then he discovers that Jaka is married and pregnant. Cerebus is threatened by Weisshaupt's secret invention of cannons, but Weisshaupt suffers a heart attack and Cerebus continues his papal reign of terror. He is finally ejected from the Upper City by the sudden invasion of the giant stone Thrunk, who claims to be the God Tarim.\n\nCerebus returns to Iest's Upper City and uses Weisshaupt's cannons to destroy Thrunk and reclaim the papacy. Astoria has mysteriously killed the Western pope (\"the Lion of Serrea\"), and Cerebus must execute her for the crime in order to retain his papacy. Cerebus confronts her in a dungeon, and after being taunted by Astoria, he grants himself a divorce from Red Sophia, marries himself to Astoria, rapes her, and then divorces himself from her. Astoria's trial, which echoes with similarities to a repeating pattern of historical executions of reformers, is interrupted when Cerebus makes the predicted Ascension to the Moon that is the culmination of the land's religious prophecy. There, Cerebus meets the Judge, a timeless, godlike being who has watched over history from the very beginning. (Sim had based the personality of this character on cartoonist and playwright Jules Feiffer.) The Judge explains his version of the creation myth of Cerebus's universe, before warning Cerebus that he will live only a few more years before dying \"alone, unmourned and unloved.\" The Judge tells Cerebus that if the Aardvark ever questions his suffering, he should remember his \"second marriage\" to Astoria. Cerebus then falls back to earth, where he discovers that the Cirinists have invaded, and his empire has collapsed.\n\nCerebus returns to Iest, now under a brutal Cirinist dictatorship, and runs into Jaka again. She is illegally working as a dancer in her landlord's tavern. The landlord/barman, Pud, treats Jaka kindly but secretly spends his days lusting after her. Cerebus agrees to live with Jaka and her husband Rick as their houseguest. That story is interwoven with unreliable tales of Jaka's childhood told by a writer, representing Oscar Wilde, using notes and stories provided by Rick. In the end Cerebus disguises himself and travels to the Lower City to buy a jar of paint. While he is gone, the Cirinists find the tavern, kill Pud and arrest Jaka, Rick, and Oscar. Jaka is made to sign a confession of immoral behavior, and is reunited with Rick; however, the Cirinists reveal to Rick that Jaka aborted the son that Rick always wanted. He lashes out at Jaka and is allowed to divorce her (although he is maimed for striking her). Jaka returns to Palnu, and Cerebus returns to the inn to find it in ruins.\n\nThis story arc concentrates on the last days and death of Oscar Wilde (who is attended to by his trusted companion Robbie Ross) rather than on Cerebus himself, who appears in only a few pages. (The title refers to the gothic novel \"Melmoth the Wanderer\" by Charles Robert Maturin, a relative of Wilde's. Wilde adopted this alias during this period of his life.) Meanwhile, a catatonic Cerebus, believing Jaka to be dead, spends his days mourning on the patio of a café. In the last few pages of the story, after the main action had concluded, Cerebus overhears a conversation by two Cirinist jailers insulting Jaka. Enraged, Cerebus murders one of the guards and then springs into action.\n\nFirst part of the \"Mothers and Daughters\" story arc. Cerebus's return to Iest and slaughter of Cirinsts leads to a very brief failed revolution. Cerebus descends into darkness and speaks with Suenteus Po. Meanwhile, Cirin works to manage her sect and arrange her own Ascension. Artemis, with Elrod as his sidekick, also stages his own impromptu revolution under his new persona \"PunisherRoach\", a parody of the Marvel comics character The Punisher.\n\nSecond part of the story-arc \"Mothers and Daughters\". Cerebus crashes back to earth. He is assisted by a mysterious old woman who is being openly spied upon by the Cirinists; she sends him to a bar to hide. This story arc includes a parody of Neil Gaiman's \"Sandman\" in which the Roach plays \"Swoon\" (a parody of Dream) and Elrod plays \"Snuff\" (a transvestite parody of Death). Astoria and Cirin symbolically duel in a dream realm. The book includes excerpts from books written by Astoria and Cirin that describe their differing beliefs. Cerebus flies across the city to slay Astoria, but is interrupted by the arrival of Suenteus Po.\n\nThird part of the \"Mothers and Daughters\" story arc. This book primarily consists of two long text pieces. The first revolves around an author of \"Reads\", heavily illustrated books in Cerebus's world. In this story, there is a strong thread about the dangers of commercial success and \"selling out\". The series moves from this storyline to a long essay attributed to Viktor Davis, a fictional \"Reads\" author. This essay puts forth a theory on the nature of the genders, describing the \"Female Void\" focused on feeling, and the \"Male Light\" focused on reason. These two stories are accompanied by a long discussion between Cirin, Astoria, Cerebus, and Suenteus Po. Po gives information about aardvarks, including that all aardvarks have Cerebus' \"magnifier\" quality, and attempts to convince each of the others to abandon their pursuits of power and return to what they enjoy doing most, then leaves them to their fates. Astoria is convinced and also leaves, but not before giving Cerebus information about her history with Cirin and also informing him of his hermaphrodite nature. Cerebus and Cirin then engage in a long and brutal fight, which leads to the beginning of another ascension.\n\nFourth and concluding part of the \"Mothers and Daughters\" story arc. Cerebus and Cirin ascend, then are separated by a mysterious force. As Cerebus flies through the solar system, he is shown images from his past and is forced to reconsider his actions and his faith. He then encounters a disembodied voice calling itself \"Dave\" that acknowledges itself as Cerebus's creator. \"Dave\" shows Cerebus the history of the Cirinist movement, revealing that Cirin is actually named Serna and was the best friend of the real Cirin (the old woman Cerebus encountered in \"Women\"), but usurped Cirin's leadership and effectively exchanged identities with her. \"Dave\" then gives Cerebus information about his past, showing that Cerebus unwittingly ruined his original destiny, causing chaotic repercussions which have influenced most of his adventures. Cerebus demands that \"Dave\" \"make\" Jaka love him; in response, \"Dave\" shows Cerebus visions of possible futures between himself and Jaka, all of which are disastrously flawed for both of them due to Cerebus' nature. After a period of penance and self-reflection on Pluto, Cerebus asks \"Dave\" to place him in a bar he remembers from his mercenary days.\n\nCerebus spends time, and eventually becomes bartender, in one of the Cirinists' bars where \"degenerate\" men are essentially quarantined from the female citizens. Described in the trade paperback's introduction as based on a bar that Sim frequented during a near-alcoholic stint between relationships, the series features various parodic characters who come and go while Cerebus remains stationary. Cerebus begins a somewhat reluctant relationship with a woman named Joanne, who was first introduced in one of the possible futures with Jaka that \"Dave\" showed Cerebus in \"Minds\".\n\nEventually Jaka's ex-husband Rick arrives at the bar. He has significantly aged, become a heavy drinker (having barely been able to tolerate alcohol in \"Jaka's Story\"), and it is gradually revealed that the mental and emotional scars from the events at the end of \"Jaka's Story\" have left him mildly insane. Rick is working on a book about his life, which gradually becomes a religious work in which Cerebus is a holy figure and Rick his follower. Joanne returns and taunts Cerebus by courting Rick. At the end of the book, Rick departs, for reasons not entirely clear, and tells Cerebus that he will see Rick only once more in his life. After Rick has left, Jaka shows up at the bar, and she and Cerebus depart together, heading for Cerebus' childhood home of Sand Hills Creek.\n\nFirst part of the \"Going Home\" story arc. Cerebus and Jaka travel across land, then on a river boat. Cerebus is eager to make as much time as possible, as he fears being trapped in the mountains near Sand Hills Creek by winter, but instead he indulges Jaka's desire for shopping and public appearances. Along the way, they encounter veiled hostility from the Cirinists. Cerebus and Jaka's relationship begins to show signs of deterioration, and Jaka is almost tempted away by F. Stop Kennedy (a fictional version of F. Scott Fitzgerald), a writer who has accompanied them on their river boat.\n\nSecond and concluding part of the story arc \"Going Home\". Cerebus and Jaka continue their journey towards Sand Hills Creek, in the company of Ham and Mary Ernestway, analogues to Ernest Hemingway and his fourth wife, Mary. On the trip, Mary tells them about some of her and Ham's journeys. This material is based on Mary Hemingway's journals about Ernest's last African safaris prior to his death. Ham dies in what appears to be suicide, but Cerebus becomes convinced Mary murdered him and flees in panic, taking Jaka with him. They discover that they have been traveling in circles without making any significant progress toward Sand Hills Creek, and nearly die in a blizzard. They finally arrive in Sand Hills Creek only to find that Cerebus' parents are dead and the rest of the community has shunned Cerebus for his perceived abandonment of his family. Cerebus drives Jaka away, blaming her for keeping him away too long.\n\nFirst part of the story arc \"Latter Days\". After a prodigious leap in time over two issues, Cerebus returns from the north intent on provoking the Cirinists into killing him. Instead, he is captured by a trio of characters based on the Three Stooges, who await a religious revelation from him. While Cerebus was in the north, a religious movement developed out of the teachings of Rick and his writings about Cerebus. Once Cerebus supplies the required revelation, he inspires a successful anti-Cirinist rebellion and a subsequent reordering of society. Much of the second half of this chapter consists of Cerebus giving a highly idiosyncratic analysis of the \"Torah\". Published over the course of nearly a year, this section, called \"Chasing YHWH\" was presented almost entirely in text format, with minimal art. This story arc is unusual in that disembodied thought balloons give the impression that Cerebus is speaking directly to the reader at times. It is revealed in the last issue of the arc that Cerebus has been talking to a woman reporter who bears a striking resemblance to Jaka. He eventually falls in love with the woman and marries her.\n\nThe second and concluding part of \"Latter Days\", and the conclusion of the series as a whole. In the first 40 pages Cerebus has a dream or vision in which cosmology is seen as a reflection of theology, complete with explanatory footnotes by Sim. Upon waking Cerebus — now incredibly aged, decrepit, pain-ridden, and mildly senile — makes the laborious trek to his writing desk to write down his new revelation. He then hides the manuscript, and it is implied that nobody will find it for two thousand years.\n\nCerebus spends most of the rest of the book trying to persuade his chief of security, Walter O'Reilly (named after Corporal Walter (Radar) O'Reilly from \"M A S H\") to admit his son, Shep-Shep, with whom he remembers sharing an idyllic father-son relationship. However, the Sanctuary is under lockdown due to opposition from a new and even more rabidly \"feminist-homosexualist\" group led by Shep-Shep's mother, whom Cerebus refers to as \"New Joanne\", which favors such \"rights\" as pedophilia, zoophilia, juvenile recreational drug use and lesbian motherhood. As a result, social values have undergone a complete breakdown.\n\nCerebus finally goes to bed despairing of seeing his son again, but Shep-Shep manages to sneak into Cerebus' room late that night. Their subsequent conversation shatters Cerebus' last illusions about his son. Shep-Shep has aligned himself with his mother, who has been conducting genetic engineering experiments, partly with knowledge gained from Cirin's earlier experimentation. Cerebus is disgusted and horrified when Shep-Shep shows him the results of one of the experiments, a lion cub with a human baby's head, and explains his mother's plans.\n\nAs Shep-Shep leaves, Cerebus grabs a knife, intending to kill him, but falls out of bed and breaks his neck, alone, unmourned, and unloved, just as the Judge had predicted. His life flashes before his eyes in a series of flashback panels and his ghost sees many of his old friends and enemies waiting for him in \"the Light.\" Jaka, Bear, and Ham beckon to him, and he eagerly rushes to join them, thinking they are in Heaven, but then he notices the absence of Rick and realizes that the Light may in fact be Hell. He calls out to God for help, but is dragged into the Light nonetheless.\n\n\nEach of the six issues includes one or two Cerebus stories not all of which are included in the \"phone books\".\n\n\"Swords of Cerebus\" Vol. 1, January 1981\n\"Swords of Cerebus\" Vol. 2, June 1981\n\"Swords of Cerebus\" Vol. 3, Fall 1981\n'Swords of Cerebus' Vol. 4, Fall 1982\n\"Swords of Cerebus\" Vol 5, Summer 1983\n\"Swords of Cerebus\" Vol 6, Fall 1984\n\nAll of the stories above except \"Demonhorn\" were reprinted in \"Cerebus World Tour Book 1995\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpawn #10, May 1993\n\nThe March 2011 (incorrectly dated March 2010 on the reverse cover) issue of \"Glamourpuss\" #18, written and drawn by Sim\n\n\nIn 2017, Sim started publishing a new four-issue sequel series in which Cerebus ends up wandering - and, as usual, badmouthing - his way through Hell as depicted in Dante Aligheri's \"Divine Comedy\", with illustrations by Gustave Doré and Dave Sim. He has gone on to release one-shot issues each month.\n\nCerebus is a misanthropic anthropomorphic bipedal gray aardvark. He refers to himself by name, in the third person, with occasional exceptions in the early issues. Sim has described Cerebus's voice as sounding like George C. Scott's. Although Cerebus considers himself male, and is treated as such, he is a hermaphrodite, possessing both sexes' genitalia and reproductive systems. Theoretically he is capable of impregnating himself; however, a childhood injury to his uterus makes this impossible.\n\nCerebus is an amoral character. He is often foul-mouthed and uncouth, has a vicious temper, and loves getting drunk. In the \"Guys\" story arc, Cerebus is described as having \"a self-absorption that borders on the pathological.\" In \"Church and State\", Cerebus, after becoming Pope, uses brutal methods to teach morality lessons. However, he is brave, crafty, and can show genuine affection to those he considers equals or those he has feelings for. He is a skilled tactician and strategist, is very proficient at hand to hand combat, and has a knack for improvisation and manipulation. He received training in magic as a child, but is depicted as being able to recognize magic and deal with it rather than use it.\n\nFor most of the series' run, Cerebus possesses an innate \"magnifier\" ability. This ability, which he shows little (if any) conscious awareness of, is a tendency for events occurring around him to become unusually focused and ordered, with intensified actions and consequences and sometimes with paranormal effects, then fall out of place in his absence. This ability also affects the people around him to varying degrees, amplifying their personality traits and abilities, and also amplifies any magic that is present.\n\n\nVarious other characters in the series were designed to resemble famous actors, politicians, and other personalities and comic in-jokes, including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Professor X (with a bit of Chris Claremont thrown in), Canadian Member of Parliament Sheila Copps, director Woody Allen, Alan Moore, Rick Veitch, Oscar Wilde, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Norman Mailer, Rodney Dangerfield, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Chico Marx.\n\nThe first 22 Cerebus stories were collected in six issues of \"Swords of Cerebus\", plus one supplement to volume six, and these stories were then collected in \"Cerebus\" #1. \"Swords of Cerebus\" also published several new short Cerebus stories, listed under \"Other appearances\" above, which were not reprinted in the \"phone books\" \n\nAll of the story arcs from the Cerebus comic book have been reprinted in collected omnibus editions of 240–630 pages each, all of which are presently still in print. They are generally referred to by fans and retailers as \"Cerebus\" \"phone books\" due to their size; also, they use the same newsprint paper as the original comics.\n\nSim has released two collections of his responses to readers' letters (the original letters are not included) after the publication of \"Cerebus\" #300. \"Collected Letters 2004\" () was released in 2005, and \"Collected Letters vol. 2\" was released in 2007.\n\nMiscellaneous stories not appearing in the above collections have been reprinted in the short collections \"Cerebus World Tour Book\" and in \"Cerebus Number Zero\", which reprints issues #51, 112/113 and parts of issues #137 & 138. A few standalone, uncollected stories have appeared in various collections and magazines over the years, and Cerebus has made cameo appearances on the covers of magazines such as \"Comics Revue\". Sim also marketed a set of \"Diamondback\" cards (based upon a game seen in early issues) in the 1980s. All of the material in the \"Cerebus\" arc was reprinted in smaller collections called \"Swords of Cerebus\" before Sim decided on the \"phonebook\" format.\n\nThe phonebooks themselves tie into ideas presented in the series. Although grammatically incorrect, the titles of books 8 through 11 could be read as a sentence (\"women read minds, guys\" – the concept of women reading minds is a key plot point). Also, beginning with \"Going Home\" (the first storyline begun after Sim's religious conversion), the covers of each \"phone book\" are printed in full color, with \"Going Home\" and \"Form and Void\" using Gerhard's scenic nature photography as covers, rather than the drawings used on past books.\n\n\"Cerebus Syndrome\" is a term used to refer to a series, in any medium, initially comedic or superficial, that gradually becomes more serious, complex and dramatic.\n\n"}

It was first published in October 1981 by Ticknor & Fields.\n\nThe book compiles approximately 3,000 capsule album reviews, most of which were originally written by Christgau for his \"Consumer Guide\" column in \"The Village Voice\" throughout the 1970s. The entries feature annotated details about each record's release and cover a variety of genres related to rock music. Many of the older reviews were rewritten for the guide to reflect his matured stylistic approach and changed perspective on the music.\n\nThe guide was critically well received, with praise given to its extensive discography, Christgau's judgment, and colorful writing. Reviewers also noted his opinionated tastes, analytical commentary, pithy language, and critical quips. The book later appeared on several expert lists of popular music literature. A staple of rock-era reference works, \"Christgau's Record Guide\" became widely popular in libraries as a source for popular music studies and as an authoritative guide for fellow critics, record collectors, and music shops.\n\n\"Christgau's Record Guide\" has been reprinted several times in book form and later on Christgau's website in its entirety. Two more \"Consumer Guide\" collections have been published, compiling his capsule reviews from the 1980s and the 1990s, respectively.\n\nIn 1969, Robert Christgau began reviewing contemporary album releases in his \"Consumer Guide\" column, which was published more-or-less monthly in \"The Village Voice\", and for brief periods in \"Newsday\" and \"Creem\" magazine during the 1970s. His method to the column selected some 20 or so albums to assess in capsule review format, averaging approximately 50 words each, before assigning a letter grade on a scale of A-plus to E-minus. This was a product of \"The Village Voice\"s deal with Christgau—allotting him one 2,500-word piece per month—and his desire to provide prospective buyers with ratings of albums, including those that did not receive significant airplay. Some of these columns were reprinted in Christgau's first book, \"Any Old Way You Choose It\", a 1973 anthology of essays previously published in the \"Voice\" and \"Newsday\".\n\nAmong the most revered and influential of the earliest rock critics, Christgau wrote the \"Consumer Guide\" with confidence in his tastes, conviction that popular music could be consumed intelligently, and interest in finding new understandings of the aesthetic and political dimensions in popular culture's intersection with the avant-garde. As a journalist, he wanted to convey his findings in a way that would entertain and provoke readers.\n\"Christgau's Record Guide\" collects approximately 3,000 \"Consumer Guide\" reviews of albums through the 1970s. The reviews are arranged alphabetically by artist name and accompanied by annotations for each record. Some older albums were regraded to reflect Christgau's changed perspective, while other records and text from the original columns were omitted in favor of new material. Many of the original reviews were expanded and extensively revised by Christgau for the guide, more than half of which consequently features material in previously unpublished form. He later said, \"much of the early CG material was rewritten for the book for a reason—I didn't evolve my current high-density stylistic approach until 1975 or so\".\n\nThe book covers albums from a variety of rock-related genres including hard rock, heavy metal, punk rock, funk, disco, soul, blues, country, and reggae. With regards to its scope, Christgau said he \"tried to grade every '70s rock album worth owning\". The reviews often feature analytical commentary on the aesthetic or cultural significance of the music, as well as critical one-liner jokes; his review of the 1973 Leonard Cohen album \"Live Songs\" states Cohen \"risks turning into the Pete Seeger of romantic existentialism\", while the Doobie Brothers' \"Takin' It to the Streets\" (1976) is panned in a single sentence: \"You can lead a Doobie to the recording studio, but you can't make him think.\"\n\nThe book is appended with introductory essays by Christgau, including a historical overview of rock and an explanation of his grading system; an A-plus record is defined as \"an organically conceived masterpiece that repays prolonged listening\", while \"E records are frequently cited as proof that there is no God.\" The last section of the book, titled \"A Basic Record Library\", has individual listings of what he regarded as the essential records of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, respectively.\n\n\"Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies\" was first published in October 1981 by Ticknor & Fields in New Haven. It was released at a time when bookstores saw an influx of rock music reference books as publishers competed with one another for the market. The book saw publication again the following year through the London-based Vermilion imprint, and was reprinted in 1985 by Houghton Mifflin in New York.\n\nIn 1990, \"Christgau's Record Guide\" was reprinted by Da Capo Press under the title \"Rock Albums of the Seventies: A Critical Guide\". It was followed by \"\" that same year and \"Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s\" in 2000, forming a three-volume series of books compiling the capsule reviews. The contents of all three \"Consumer Guide\" collections were made available on Christgau's website after it went online in 2001.\n\nReviewing the guide in 1982 for \"The New York Times\", Robert Palmer said it \"stands out\" in the recent slew of rock reference publications \"because it is both obsessively complete and caustically outspoken\". Palmer acknowledged Christgau's maturity, intelligence, and humor as a rock critic and wrote in sum, \"although one won't always agree with Mr. Christgau, his book is a useful reference source for anyone with a serious interest in recent rock. It's a bit too cantankerously opinionated to deserve an A-plus, but it certainly repays reading and rereading.\" \"\" magazine highly recommended the guide, arguing that it functions superbly as a read for spontaneous pleasure and a reference to rock's \"major and minor classics\" while highlighting the last section for \"any librarian building a rock music collection\". \"Illinois Libraries\", the journal publication of the Illinois Library Association, advised AV librarians to consult the guide for help in selecting music recordings to archive. The journal's reviewer called Christgau \"a senior critic if rock music has such a thing\" and suggested readers focus more on his enthusiasms than dislikes: \"As a record selector, you shouldn't care that Christgau looks down his nose at John Denver, but his praise for Eno, The Ramones, and Terry Garthwaite is well-founded and meaningful.\" Lee Ash, general editor of the Haworth Press's \"Special Collections\" journal, reviewed it as among books recommended to library special collections. The guide's \"quality, content, scope, and evaluative notes\" impressed Ash, who had a greater familiarity with discographies of early chamber music and only a mild enthusiasm for rock music. He concluded it was \"an indispensable book\" for music collection and providing \"critical material for argument\". In \"Year by Year in the Rock Era\" (1983), Herb Hendler named it among the books and magazines \"relevant to youth and the rock era\".\n\nInspired by Christgau's writing in the early 1970s to pursue a journalistic career, Steve Simels ended up reviewing the book for \"Stereo Review\" in 1982, with qualified praise. He regarded Christgau as an indisputably well-written reviewer of fair-minded critical judgment, impressive witticisms and one-liners, and deeper interest in black music than most other white critics; but expressed reservations about what he perceived to be a mawkish sense of feminist conscience, knee jerk liberal politics, and a predilection for conceptual music, as exemplified by \"A\" grades for all four Ramones albums. After laboring through the entire guide, Simels found himself \"surprised to discover how even-handed [Christgau]'s been over the long haul\", and summed the book up as a \"worthwhile\", if not entirely reliable, reference work. In \"Library Journal\", P. G. Feehan found Christgau to be a rigorous and smart critic while deeming the book an excellent companion to the contemporaneous \"Rolling Stone Record Guide\", particularly because of Christgau's extensive coverage of albums from fringe and import record labels. Feehan's one cavil was \"his four-letter-word-studded, hip/smart style, which may turn oft readers from west of the Hudson River\". David Browne shared a similar sentiment in \"High Fidelity\", believing some of Christgau's musings would be too complicated for newcomers to rock journalism. \"But he remains one of pop's most astute critics\", Browne concluded, adding that the guide functions best as a way of discovering good records—such as Bill Withers' \"Still Bill\" (1972)—obscured by the complex discography of 1970s popular music.\n\nSome reviewers were more critical of the book. Fellow rock journalist Dave Marsh, who had cited the \"Consumer Guide\" concept as an influence on his own \"Rolling Stone Record Guide\", gave the collection a B-plus in \"Musician\". He found Christgau \"concise, contentious, condescending, provocative and pedagogic\" with a shrewd sense of judgment and sharp insight, but complained of gratuitous, off-topic commentary and possible attempts to keep up with fashionable consensus, as there were no clear indications which reviews had been rewritten in retrospect for the book. Marsh ultimately questioned whether Christgau's tough-mindedness and ideological rigidity made him ideal for a guide book and asked what it means if \"the most influential rock critic has never written a book that wasn't an anthology\". A response by Christgau was published in the magazine a few months later, in which he expressed appreciation for Marsh's \"kind words\" about the book and referred back to its introductory essay to answer questions posed in the review: \"Though I don't indicate which reviews are newly written, I do state that I've reconsidered every record I had doubts about and stand by every judgment. As the co-editor of a competing consumer guide, Dave knows that the most important thing to do when you're reviewing records is to listen to them first.\" British music scholar Paul Taylor issued different complaints about the book in his 1985 guide to literature on popular music, \"Popular Music Since 1955\". He called \"Christgau's Record Guide\" \"an odd collection\" for several reasons. \"Included are certainly the best albums\", he observed, \"but it is the way in which the bad examples are selected that is dubious, and simply mediocre records are avoided.\"\n\n\"Christgau's Record Guide\" and similar review collections played a role in the rise of rock critics as tastemakers, promoters, and cultural historians in the music industry, whose standards were being reinvented by the genre. These critics constructed their own versions of what popular music academic Roy Shuker called \"the traditional high/low culture split, usually around notions of artistic integrity, authenticity, and the nature of commercialism\". As with \"The Rolling Stone Record Guide\", \"Christgau's Record Guide\" became popular with music aficionados, collectors, and both secondhand and specialty record stores, who kept copies of different volumes on hand. Christgau's guides to the 1970s and 1980s were \"bibles in the field\", as Shuker described, \"establishing orthodoxies as to the relative value of various styles or genres and pantheons of artists\". While reviewing the 1980s volume for the \"Chicago Tribune\" in 1990, Greg Kot said \"Christgau's Record Guide\" and Ira Robbins' \"Trouser Press Record Guide\" had been \"the bibles of my existence as a rock critic\". Christgau believed the 1970s guide to be the most \"authoritative\" in the series because the decade's smaller music market was easier to process, and also \"a kind of canon-defining work, making the case for Van Morrison and, say, the McGarrigle sisters, and against Black Sabbath and, say, Donny Hathaway.\" In Eric Weisbard's opinion, he \"wasn't so much canonizing as using the endless listening party to find new wrinkles in his, and popular music's, unsummarizable aesthetic\".\n\n\"Christgau's Record Guide\" was published in an era when popular music studies were the domain of non-academic sources such as journalists rather than music departments and classical academics. It became widely popular in library catalogues by the late 1980s, along with other anthologized works of rock journalism by critics like Ellen Willis and Lester Bangs. The \"Consumer Guide\" reviews collected in the book were cited by Weisbard as part of rock and popular music's reinvention of critical standards. The end of the 20th century saw a paradigm shift, however, as paid journalism declined and academic departments gradually embraced popular music studies. In 1997, the Music Library Association used the book as a reference to prepare select rock recordings for \"A Basic Music Library: Essential Scores and Sound Recordings\", published by the American Library Association as a guide for librarians and other specialist collectors.\n\n\"Christgau's Record Guide\" has been regarded as \"essential rock writing\" by literary academic Cornel Bonca. Chuck Eddy included it in his buying guide to books on rock music, while Jon Savage recommended it as a useful discography of that decade's punk rock. In 2006, all three \"Consumer Guide\" books were collectively ranked fifth on \"The A.V. Club\"s list of the 17 essential books about popular music; in the website's opinion, Christgau \"made a sublime art of the capsule review, packing pithy observations and heartfelt appreciation into 150-word boxes\". Michaelangelo Matos, a staff writer for the website, was greatly influenced by Christgau and said the first two volumes were books he had read most frequently as an adult. He highlighted Christgau's humor, ability to extract the essence of an album in a few sentences, and punctuating of reviews with letter grades, \"a cunning rhetorical device as much as simple judgment\". Fellow critic Rob Sheffield named the 1970s guide among his six favorite books in a list published by \"The Week\", believing other \"obsessive music freaks\" likely own it too. \"This book is the all-time rock-'n'-roll argument starter\", he said, \"and I'll be arguing with it for the rest of my life.\" It was also read by novelists Dylan Hicks and Jonathan Lethem when they were young adults; Lethem later revealed that \"for years, I calibrated my record collection against the grades ... jotting dissenting views in pencil in the margins\". In 2016, \"Billboard\" placed it at number 47 on a list of the 100 greatest music books; an accompanying blurb read: \"His '70s collection offers a fantastic primer on rock and soul's most fruitful decade. Whether or not you share Christgau's passion for Al Green's 'Let's Get Married' or his disdain for all things Eagles, you'll love his pith and wit.\"\n\n\n"}

The first collected volume, which was produced in 1779, had a title page which bore an allegorical illustration as well as the full title of the collection: Gallerie des modes et des costumes français dessinés d'après nature, Gravés par le plus Célèbres Artistes en ce genre, et colorés avec le plus grand soin par Madame Le Beau. Ouvrage commence en l'année 1778. A Paris, chez le Srs Esnauts et Rapilly rue St. Jacques à la Ville de coutances. Avec priv. Du Roi (\"Gallery of French fashions and costumes, drawn from life, engraved by the most celebrated artists in this medium, and hand-colored with the greatest care by Madame Le Beau;publication begun in 1778. Paris, Messrs. Esnauts and Rapilly, rue Satin-Jacques, at the sign of the City of Countances. Licensed by the King\"). Importantly, this lengthier epithet indicates that the engravings of the \"Galerie\" (or \"Gallerie\", according to eighteenth-century spelling) were created \"d'après nature,\" or \"after nature,\" meaning that they were intended to represent what was actually worn in the streets of Paris during the latter part of the eighteenth century.\n\nAlthough they vary in their presentation, the majority of images included in this series are \"tableaux vivants\" in which Parisians from various walks of life flaunt their quotidian fashions. These plates were completed by a group of prominent, eighteenth-century designers and engravers and are accompanied by descriptive text. Although no private or public collection possesses a complete edition of the \"Galerie,\" the series is widely recognized for its high aesthetic value as well as its innovation within the overarching field of the fashion plate. René Colas, who compiled the major reference work \"Bibliographie générale du costume et de la mode\" (1933), calls it \"the most beautiful collection in existence on the fashions of the eighteenth century.\"\n\n\"Galerie des modes\" was conceived during the final decades of the 1700s, a period when France was at the forefront of fashion innovation. To quote the historian James Laver, at this time \"fashionable clothes...meant French clothes.\" This supreme influence was undoubtedly strengthened by Queen Marie Antoinette as well as figures such as Rose Bertin (her dressmaker) and Monsieur Léonard Autié (her hairdresser) who were responsible for designing her iconic courtly wardrobe. Beginning in the 1770s (the decade during which Antoinette both married future king Louis-Auguste and assumed the title Queen of France and Navarre), women's dress came to exhibit greater variation than ever before; the fashion plate emerged under these conditions, as if to disseminate each budding trend.\n\nDespite the prominence of eighteenth-century French style, the first true fashion plates were produced for \"The Lady's Magazine\", a British publication established in 1770. Prior to this date, the majority of prints published in France, such as Jean Dieu de Saint-Jean's engravings of male and female costume at the Court of Louis XIV, were \"costume plates,\" which depicted clothes \"after the event.\" Information concerning the latest fashion was difficult to come by, so difficult, in fact, that the aforementioned Rose Bertin would travel the Continent each year in an enormous \"berline\" containing dolls dressed in the most up-to-date \"modes de Paris\". Ostensibly rendered \"after nature\", according to the everyday observations of prominent contemporary artists, the engravings of the \"Galerie\" thus responded to a growing demand for fashion news as well as a general gap in the market of French prints.\n\nThe innovative \"Galerie des modes\" is the most expansive and perhaps the best known project of the print merchants Jacques Esnauts (or Esnault) and Michel Rapilly. Both of these men hailed from the region of Normandy (Esnauts came from Magny-le-Désert, and Rapilly came from Pirou), and the name of their publishing house, \"Ville de Coutances\", reflects these common origins. Located on the rue Saint-Jacques, this \"maison\" was established on July 6, 1773 following their brief stint at the nearby \"La Croix de Lorraine,\" where they had worked about three years earlier. Here the editors primarily published portraits of both historical and contemporary subjects; they began issuing the \"Galerie\" after obtaining a \"privilège\" on July 29, 1778 and continued to do so until 1787.\n\nPerhaps in an effort to emulate the prints of \"The Lady's Magazine\", various engravers, hairdressers, and booksellers had, at this time, published a number of small almanacs on contemporary fashion. In formulating their \"Galerie\", Esnauts and Rapilly combined the subjects of these early volumes (which primarily focused on hairstyles) with the high quality of engraving found in series by the prolific Moreau le Jeune, such as \"Suite d'estampes pour servir à l'Histoire des Moeurs et du Costume\". The resulting prints were distributed at random intervals, usually in sets (\"cahiers\") of six, for the price of 36 livres (around 14 euro's in today's currency). Although many historians differ on the exact number of plates issued throughout publication, it is clear that over 400 engravings were issued in what was probably more than 70 portfolios. The first \"cahiers\" focused solely on hairstyles (\"coiffures\") However, from the seventh \"cahier\" onwards, the series began to represent full outfits, illustrated from head-to-toe. The first collected volume of the \"Galerie\" (published in 1779) included 96 plates which came from the initial 16 portfolios of the series and was preceded by a forty-page descriptive introduction written by the lawyer G.François-Roger Molé.\n\nThe \"Galerie\" implicated the work of numerous prominent visual artists. In fact, the full title of the series, which was displayed in the epigraph of the collected 1779 volume, vaunts that its illustrations were drawn by \"the most celebrated artists (\"les plus célebres artistes\") of the period, all of which had achieved the highest level of mastery in their medium. Recognized as some of the best fashion illustrators of their time, the designers tied to the project included Pierre Thomas Le Clerc (or Leclére), Claude Louis Desrais, François Louis Joseph Watteau (the grandnephew of Antoine Watteau), Augustin de Saint-Aubin, and Jean-Baptiste Martin. Claude-Ferdinand Gaillard, Jean-Baptiste Patas, Pierre Andrien Le Beau, Nicolas Dupin, his son Jean Pierre Julien, Etienne Claude Voysard, Jean Alexandre Aveline, Pélissier, Jacques Le Roy, J.P. Vossinik (or Wossinik), and Jean-François Janinet appear to have been the enlisted engravers. In certain cases, the draftsman Martin seems to have acted as both the designer and engraver. To quote Peter McNeil and Sanda Miller's \"Fashion Writing and Criticism: History, Theory, Practice\", the compositions completed by each one of these artists demonstrate \"the strong influence of figurative painting in their creation.\"\n\nAlthough there exist no contracts that officially confirm the involvement of these artists, their respective contributions are marked by signatures. With the exception of the first six notebooks (which are not signed) as well as a few other plates which seem to have been released later in publication, the names of the designer and the engraver are found below each image included in the \"Galerie\", often with variations in spelling. The name of the designer normally appears at the lower right of each plate, alongside the words \"Dessiné par\" or \"del.\" (\"delineavit\"). The name of the engraver, meanwhile, is typically found on the lower right beside the terms \"Gravé par\" (or \"Gravée par), \"sc.\" or \"sculp.\" (\"sculpsit\"). In certain rarer cases, the designer's name is accompanied by the word \"inv.\" (\"invenit\"), meaning \"invented it\" or \"devised it.\" This notation can often be viewed, for example, alongside the signature of Jean-Baptiste Martin and seems to have been used for the first time in the twenty-fourth \"cahier\" of the series.\n\nThe prints of the \"Galerie\" were rendered through a process commonly implemented in fashion plate production. The designers provided the drawings for the series, and the engravers accordingly translated their creations into prints (in this case etchings, or line engravings). These images would then be tinted by hand either prior to distribution (presumably by Madame Le Beau) or after distribution by a \"home hobbyist\". The prints, for this reason, were sold both in color and in black and white. \nPlates from the \"Galerie\" can be divided into essentially five categories of composition. Among suites depicting \"coiffures,\" three different formate emerge, all of which feature isolated figures illustrated from the shoulders up. In the first six \"cahiers\" of the \"Galerie\", the designer (whose identity is not confirmed) has rendered four figures that appear in distinct rectangular quadrants. In later four-figure, \"coiffure\"-oriented plates, the subjects are distinguished by oval-shaped frames. Particularly in plates depicting more than four hairstyles (some contain twelve or sixteen), figures are separated by individual rectangles as well as overlaid elliptical frames.\n\nAmong suites depicting entire outfits (\"habillemens à la mode\"), there emerge essentially two different compositions. In most cases, one to three full-length figures appear in what is supposed to be a general, quotidian scene. Designed to showcase the fashions worn by these characters (rather than any complex narrative action), the backgrounds of these plates contain few elements, if any at all. Though figures are sometimes drawn in a specific setting, such as a garden, patio, or dressing room, they are depicted, perhaps more often, in a nondescript indoor or outdoor space with a mostly blank background. In certain later prints, figures are drawn individually, in frames rendered at the center of the composition on a rather small scale. This inner pictorial space is surrounded by garments that, relative to the depicted figure, appear larger than life. In some cases, these accoutrements are labeled with numbers corresponding to captions at the bottom of the plate.\n\nCaptions, indeed, are found on practically every print included in the \"Galerie\". On plates with full-outfit compositions, text is printed directly below each image andusually above some variation of the inscription, \"A Paris chez Esnauts et Rapilly rue St Jacques, à la Ville de Countances. Avec Priv du Roi (or A.P.D.R.),\" which gives readers general information about publication. On certain plates devoted to \"coiffures\", captions appear in the space of the illustrated figures. Though always descriptive in nature, the content of these captions varies from plate to plate. In some cases, the text simply focuses on the intricacies of the represented fashions. However, in others, it gives a sense of narrative and highlights the identity of the depicted character. Throughout the series, the length of these captions also has a tendency to fluctuate.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century the courtly presence of Marie Antoinette was, as mentioned, absolutely instrumental to augmenting France's influence on the world of fashion at large. The subjects of the \"Galerie\", however, are by no means relegated to \"ladies of the highest rank.\" In addition to noblewomen, the series represents members of the bourgeoisie and the serving class. (To quote the exhibition catalogue, \"New for Now: The Origin of Fashion Magazines\", published by the Rijksmuseum, \"the costumier and the housemaid also appear\" in certain plates) Though outnumbered by these other subjects, the series also devotes some of its prints to the fashions of men and children.\n\nThese drawings were touted as \"designs after nature\" (\"dessinés d'après nature\"), reflecting the fact that the designers who contributed to the series would draw from life. Their compositions were based on the most fashionable garments and hairstyles of period, which they would often observe with their own eyes at popular locales, such as parks, theaters, and even the \"ateliers\" of fashionable dressmakers and tailors. Breaking ever so slightly from this mold, several plates found within the series also depict costumes made for eighteenth-century productions of theater and ballet, many of which were designed by P.N Sarrazin who is listed in various captions as the \"'Costumier des Princes\"\" (\"Costume designer of Princes\").\n\n\"Galerie des Modes\" is a huge monument to the world of fashion. As highlighted in \"New for Now\", the \"Galerie\" was circulated among a wide array of \"fashion-conscious\" audiences, both in France and abroad, and would ultimately go down in history as \"the best and largest\" fashion plate series of the eighteenth century. Among contemporary audiences, the \"Galerie\" is often regarded as the first illustrated fashion journal. However, the series actually cannot be defined as a true magazine, at least according to the modern definition of the term. The \"Cabinet des Modes ou les Modes Nouvelles\", which was first launched in 1785 and, a year later, came to be called the \"Magazin des Modes Nouvelle Françaises et Anglaises\", is recognized as the first real fashion magazine, for, in contrast to the sporadically distributed \"Galerie des Modes\", it was issued regularly (every fortnight) and reproduced typographically, contained illustrations, and focused exclusively on fashion and lifestyle.\n\nToday the original prints of \"Galerie\" are extremely rare, particularly in a comprehensively compiled form. Between 1911 and 1914, Paul Cornu and Emile Lévy published a reproduction of the series complete with hand-colored plates as well as text sourced from eighteenth-century periodicals and literature, though only 325 plates are accounted for. This rare edition can be read at a select number prominent research institutions, including Brooklyn Museum Library where one can also examine the 24-plate volume compiled and by Roger-Armand Weigert. The Frick Art Reference Library, the Brooklyn Museum, the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) in Boston, and the British Museum also house significant portions of the \"Galerie\". None, however, possess a complete run of the series.\n\nIn collections that have not been arranged as coherent volumes such as those compiled by Cornu and Weigert, each \"cahier\" seems to be categorized by a letter (or letters) which label all of its corresponding prints, and each of these prints is marked with a number, indicating its place in the \"Galerie\" as a whole. The first plate of each \"cahier\" also tends to bear a categorical epithet, such as \"9e Cahier des Costumes Français. 3e Suite d'Habillmens a la mode,\" that gives the reader basic information about its content. This system of notation, however, has not been completely resolved, for certain prints appear without numbers, letters, signatures, or, in some cases, all the above. As a result, many \"cahiers\" have been left with an incomplete appearance. Furthermore, prints that have been arranged in the customary suite of six do not always adhere to a consistent theme or compositional format. Regardless of their degree of accuracy and fidelity, the existence of these posthumous editions reflects the persistent importance of the \"Galerie\" in the worlds of fashion, costume, and, more generally, visual culture.\n\n"}
{"id": "28759039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28759039", "title": "Hall of Realms", "text": "Hall of Realms\n\nThe Salón de Reinos (translated as \"Hall of the Kingdoms\" or \"Hall of Realms\") or salón grande (\"great hall\") is a 17th-century building in Madrid, originally a wing of the Buen Retiro Palace. The Salón de Reinos and the Casón del Buen Retiro are the only survivors of the original grand scheme of the palace.\nBuilt between 1630 and 1635, the Hall of Realms housed the largest paintings in the royal collection, now all in the Museo del Prado. It is named after its paintings of the coats of arms of the 24 kingdoms which formed the Kingdom of Spain at the time of Philip IV of Spain. \n\nThe building served as the \"Museo del Ejército\" until 2010 when the military collections were put on display at the Alcázar of Toledo.\nThe Prado Museum acquired the vacant building to display part of its collections and made its renovation the subject of an architectural competition. The commission to redesign the space as part of the campus of the art museum was won by the British firm Foster and Partners and the Spanish firm Rubio Arquitectura.\n\nOriginally intended as a place from which the king could watch and assist in theatrical productions in the courtyard, the Salón de Reinos was turned into a throne room when it was decided to turn Buen Retiro into a full palace. It was still used for spectacles and soirees, so a balcony was added so that festivities could be viewed from above, but as a throne room it had to impress ambassadors and other distinguished members of the courts of Europe who visited the palace. This meant the room's decoration was the most sumptuous in the whole palace, well-illuminated by several windows between jaspers tables and silver lions and with a ceiling covered in grotesques. There were also wall paintings full of political symbolism with the ultimate aim of glorifying Philip IV. The designer of the room's decorative programme is unknown, though ultimate responsibility lay in the hands of the conde duque de Olivares himself, along with Jerónimo de Villanueva (who gave the lions and effected the payments) and with the intellectual advice of Francisco de Rioja and of the painters closest to Philip and Olivares, Juan Bautista Maíno and Velázquez.\n\nThe Salón de Reinos is rectangular in plan, with narrow doors on the two longer sides. On its north and south sides hung twelve paintings (one now lost) on the theme of the major battles won by the armies of Philip IV in the early years of his reign. Between these paintings, and above the Salón's windows, were ten paintings by Zurbarán showing the labours of Hercules, comparing the exploits of the demi-god Hercules (then considered as the ancestor of the House of Habsburg) with those of the king. \n\nThe battle paintings juxtaposed examples by artists of the older generation such as Vicente Carducho or Eugenio Cajés (who had both served Philip III of Spain) with ones by younger artists trained in naturalism such as Juan Bautista Maíno, Zurbarán (summoned from Seville for this very commission), Jusepe Leonardo, Félix Castelo (who did his first major work there), Antonio de Pereda and especially Velázquez, Philip IV's favourite.\n\nAt the east and west ends were portraits by Velázquez of the royal family. The series was made up of equestrian portraits of Philip III and his wife Margaret of Austria (both on the west all) and equestrian portraits of Philip IV and his wife Elisabeth of France either side their son and heir Balthasar Charles (all three on the east wall). These five paintings' distribution and staggered positioning exemplified the concepts of hereditary monarchy and dynastic continuity.\n\nBased on the titles held by Philip IV, the hall also contained shields showing the coats of arms of the twenty-four kingdoms that made up his kingdom: in alphabetical order, Algarbe, Algeciras, Aragón, Castilla, Cerdeña, Dos Sicilias, Galicia, Gibraltar, Granada, Indias Orientales y Occidentales, Islas de Canarias, Islas y Tierra firme del Mar Oceano, Jaén, Jerusalén, León, Murcia, Navarra, Portugal, Sevilla, Toledo and Valencia. (Philip IV also held the titles of Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, Duke of Brabant, Duke of Milan, Count of Habsburg, Count of Flanders, Count of Tyrol, Count of Barcelona and Lord of Vizcaya and of Molina.)\n\n \n\nThe layout of the portraits and battle paintings in the Salón, based on the reconstruction produced by Jose Alvarez Lopera, which is in turn based on the \"Silva topográfica\" by Manuel de Gallegos and the 1701 inventory, is as follows:\n\nThree works by Velázquez:\n\n\n\n\nOver the windows were paintings of the trials of Hercules by Zurbarán, all 130 cm x 160 cm, all oil on canvas, all now in the Prado:\n\nThe Salón de Reinos, and the Salón de Fiestas (now the Casón del Buen Retiro) were the only parts of the palace to survive the intense French bombardment between 1808 and 1814 during the Peninsular War and the appearance of the buildings were transformed by post-war rebuilding.\n\nFor a long time the Salón de Reinos housed the Museo del Ejército. In the early 21st century the Spanish Ministry of Culture launched a series of studies and reforms to move the museum to a larger, better and more modern setting at the Alcázar of Toledo, giving the Hall of Realms over to the Prado, which already had responsibility for the Casón and which could then return the Salón de Reinos to its 17th-century appearance and reinstate the paintings originally meant for it. This would be all the easier since the wall paintings, ceiling paintings and grotesques were still well preserved, but the initial proposal caused a debate on the building's final use, with some opposing it since it would separate works by Velázquez such as \"The Surrender of Breda\" from his other works in the Prado, and others since they felt that such a move was unjustified just to recreate a single room.\n\nThe Museo del Ejército reopened in Toledo in July 2010, though the works on the Salón de Reinos require more time.\nThe option taken was to give over the Salón de Reinos and its adjoining rooms to various activities such as temporary exhibitions or exhibiting medium-quality items which there is now room to display in the Prado.\nOriginally, the tender for the work was expected to be granted in 2009 or 2010, with the works occurring from 2010 to 2012, with a budget of 42.5 million Euros.\nIt is now intended that the addition of this building to the Museo del Prado’s Campus, will form part of the Museum’s 200th anniversary celebrations in 2019. In 2017 material related to the project was included in an exhibition in the Telefónica Building, Madrid, about Norman Foster. A comparison was drawn with an earlier project by the architect, the Carré d'Art in Nîmes. \n\nIn 2017 the artist Cai Guo-Qiang used the Hall of Realms for 8 works of art using gun-powder.\n\n\n"}

Lewis Carroll wrote \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" for Henry Liddell's daughter Alice.\n\nLiddell received his education at Charterhouse and Christ Church, Oxford. He gained a double first degree in 1833, then became a college tutor, and was ordained in 1838.\n\nLiddell was Headmaster of Westminster School from 1846 to 1855. Meanwhile, his life work, the great lexicon (based on the German work of Franz Passow), which he and Robert Scott began as early as 1834, had made good progress, and the first edition of \"Liddell and Scott's Lexicon\" appeared in 1843. It immediately became the standard Greek–English dictionary, with the 8th edition published in 1897.\n\nAs Headmaster of Westminster Liddell enjoyed a period of great success, followed by trouble due to the outbreak of fever and cholera in the school. In 1855 he accepted the deanery of Christ Church, Oxford. In the same year he brought out his \"History of Ancient Rome\" and took a very active part in the first Oxford University Commission. His tall figure, fine presence and aristocratic mien were for many years associated with all that was characteristic of Oxford life. Coming just at the transition period when the \"old Christ Church,\" which Pusey strove so hard to preserve, was inevitably becoming broader and more liberal, it was chiefly due to Liddell that necessary changes were effected with the minimum of friction. \n\nIn 1859 Liddell welcomed the then Prince of Wales when he matriculated at Christ Church, being the first holder of that title who had matriculated since Henry V. While Liddell was Dean of Christ Church, he arranged for the building of a new choir school and classrooms for the staff and pupils of Christ Church Cathedral School on its present site. Before then the school was housed within Christ Church itself.\n\nIn July 1846, Liddell married Lorina Reeve (1826-1910), with whom he had nine children including Alice Liddell (1852-1934) of Lewis Carroll fame.\n\nIn conjunction with Sir Henry Acland, Liddell did much to encourage the study of art at Oxford, and his taste and judgment gained him the admiration and friendship of Ruskin. In 1891, owing to advancing years, he resigned the deanery. The last years of his life were spent at Ascot, where he died on 18 January 1898. Two roads in Ascot, Liddell Way and Carroll Crescent honour the relationship between Henry Liddell and Lewis Carroll.\n\nLiddell was an Oxford \"character\" in later years. He figures in contemporary undergraduate doggerel:\n\nThe Victorian journalist, George W. E. Russell (1853–1919), conveys something of Liddell's image:\n\nHis father was Henry Liddell, Rector of Easington (1787–1872), the younger son of Sir Henry Liddell, 5th Baronet (1749–1791) and the former Elizabeth Steele. His father's elder brother, Sir Thomas Liddell, 6th Baronet (1775–1855), was raised to the Peerage as Baron Ravensworth in 1821.\n\nHis mother was the former Charlotte Lyon (1785–1871), a daughter of Thomas Lyon (1741–1796) (who was the youngest son of the 8th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne) and the former Mary Wren (died 1811).\n\nOn 2 July 1846, Henry married Lorina Reeve (3 March 1826 – 25 June 1910). They were parents of ten children:\n\n\n\n"}

( was a Panamanian law firm and corporate service provider. It was, at one time, the world's fourth largest provider of offshore financial services. From its 1977 foundation until the April 2016 publication of the Panama Papers it remained mostly obscure, even though it sits at the heart of the global offshore industry, and acts for about 300,000 companies. More than half are registered in British tax havens – as well as in the UK. The firm received worldwide media attention in April 2016, when the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published information about its clients' financial dealings in the Panama Papers articles, following the release of an enormous cache of its documents from between 1970 and 2015 leaked to the news media. Journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who led the disclosure efforts, was subsequently murdered by a car bomb on October 16, 2017.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, the law firm announced that it was shutting down, because of the economic and reputational damage inflicted by the disclosure of its role in global tax evasion by the Panama Papers.\n\nThe firm was founded by German lawyer Jürgen Mossack in 1977 and joined by Panamanian novelist/lawyer Ramón Fonseca in 1986. It later added a third director, Swiss lawyer Christoph Zollinger.\n\nIt specialized in commercial law, trust services, investor advisory, and international business structures. It also offers intellectual property protection and maritime law services. An internal memorandum revealed in the 2016 Panama papers leak noted that 95% of the company's work consists of \"selling vehicles to avoid taxes\".\n\nIn 2013, the firm was described as one of seven that collectively represented more than half of the offshore companies incorporated in Panama. The firm also houses several Panama-incorporated companies within its offices. It was one of the largest firms in the corporate services industry. However, the founder claims that its volume represents only around 5% of the global financial services legal industry. According to \"The Economist\", the firm has 5 to 10% of the global shell company market, and it has been described as \"tight-lipped\".\n\nThe firm has nine offices in China, several in Latin America, others in the United States and Europe, with two in Switzerland. Lawyers from the firm have been sent to foreign countries to promote business in Panama and Panamanian financial products.\n\nMossack established operations in the British Virgin Islands in 1987, where it incorporated more than 100,000 companies.\n\nThe firm was consulted by the country of Niue when it sought to become an offshore financial center, and managed that business exclusively for the country through their Panama headquarters. However, American banks imposed embargoes on bank transfers to Niue in 2001, leading to a shutdown of the business in 2005. Accounts of the firm's clients were moved from Niue to American Samoa.\n\nThe firm has allegedly helped foreign citizens circumvent their local tax laws and sometimes even international sanctions. The firm's founder has argued that it simply helps its clients achieve privacy, and that it now complies with \"know your customer\" regulations.\n\nIn 2014, MF Corporate Services was subpoenaed by a hedge fund seeking to recover money from the Argentinian government.The fund alleged that MF had created shell companies to pass money from the government to Lázaro Báez, an ally of the Kirchner family. Jürgen Mossack testified under oath that M.F. Corporate Services (Nevada) Ltd. had no affiliation with the Panamanian Mossack Fonseca, but the Panama Papers show that it was in fact a wholly owned subsidiary and Mossack Fonseca tried to hide the relationship, ordering emails and other computer footprints deleted. Despite Mossack Fonseca's claim that it did not own MF Corporate Services, a Nevada judge ruled that the subpoena against Mossack Fonseca was valid. The firm was fighting an order that it turn over the details of 123 shell companies created by an associate of a former President of Argentina.\n\nIn February 2015, the firm was implicated in the German government's investigation of money laundering and tax evasion schemes at Commerzbank.\n\nIn January 2016, employees of the firm's Brazilian office were charged in relation to the ongoing Petrobras corruption scandal. In that case, a judge alleged that \"Mossack Fonseca provided services for the opening of offshore societies, and at least four agents were involved in a scheme to launder money.\" The firm has responded that the Brazilian office is a \"franchise\" and not controlled by the main office in Panama. The firm's founder resigned from his advisory position to the Panamanian government to focus on the Brazilian allegations, and says the firm has been cleared.\n\nOn 3 April 2016, the German newspaper \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" (\"SZ\") announced that 11.5 million confidential documents from the firm had been leaked to them. These documents, dubbed the \"Panama Papers\", reveal how clients hid billions of dollars in tax havens. Comprising documents dating from the 1970s to the present, the 2.6 terabytes of data was given to \"SZ\" in 2015 by an anonymous source. Because of the amount of data, \"SZ\" enlisted the help of the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).\n\nThe firm says that this coverage has \"misrepresented\" their work. In its full statement the company asserts that it conducts due diligence on potential clients, \"routinely denying services\" to those who are \"compromised\", and \"routinely resigns from client engagements\" when ongoing due diligence and/or updates to sanctions lists reveal problems. In addition, however, the company has said that responsibility for potential legal violations may lie with failures or lapses by other institutions given that:\n\napproximately 90% of our clientele is professional clients, such as international financial institutions as well as trust companies and prominent law and accounting firms, who act as intermediaries and are regulated in the jurisdiction of their business. These clients are obliged to perform due diligence on their clients in accordance with the KYC and AML [ Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering respectively ] regulations to which they are subject.\n\nThe company informed clients on 3 April 2016, that files had been obtained through a hack of the company's email server. \"Forbes\" has suggested that the firm's information security was poor, running old versions of key tools, and still other vulnerabilities have since been discovered.\n\nShortly after the leak, Panamanian, Peruvian, and Salvadorian police raided the local offices of Mossack Fonseca.\n\nOn 14 March 2018, the firm announced that it would be shutting down as a result of the economic and reputational damage inflicted as a result of the Panama Papers leak, together with what it described as 'unusual actions by certain Panamanian authorities'.\n\n"}

A positive setting of the parameter allows an empty pro-element to be identified by its governor. This is the case in pro-drop languages.\n\nA term used in government-binding theory for a specification of the types of variation that a principle of grammar manifests among different languages. It is suggested that there are no rules of grammar in the traditional sense, but only principles which can take a slightly different form in different languages. For example, a head parameter specifies the positions of heads within phrases (e.g. head-first in English, head-last in Japanese). The adjacency parameter of case theory specifies whether case assigners must be adjacent to their noun phrases (e.g. to the left in English, to the right in Chinese). The pro-drop (or ‘null subject’) parameter determines whether the subject of a clause can be suppressed. Determining the parametric values for given languages is known as parameter-setting. The overall approach has been called the principles and parameters theory (PPT) of universal grammar, and has since come to be applied outside of syntactic contexts, notably in characterizing phonological relations. Later versions of metrical phonology, for example, recognize a series of parameters governing the way metrical feet should be represented, such as quantity sensitivity and directionality.\n\n(in universal grammar) a parameter which determines whether the subject in declarative sentences may be deleted. Parameters vary in different languages within certain defined limits. Languages such as Italian and Arabic can have subject-less declarative sentences, e.g. Italian parla ‘he/she speaks/talks’, and are referred to as pro-drop languages. However, languages such as English, French and German do not typically omit the subject in declarative sentences. They are referred to as non-pro-drop languages, e.g.:\nThe term pro-drop is used because in the d-structure of the grammar, the empty subject position is filled by the element pro, e.g.\npro parla\nThe pro-drop parameter and other parameters of Universal Grammar have attracted the interest of researchers working in the fields of child language acquisition and language teaching. For example, the question has been raised: How do children ‘set’ a UG parameter to fit their particular language? Researchers in second language acquisition have investigated what happens if a parameter in the speaker’s native language is different from that of their target language, making it necessary to ‘reset’ the parameter. This would happen, for example, in the acquisition of Spanish (a pro-drop language) by speakers of non-pro-drop languages such as English and French.\n\nIn GB, anyone of various putative universal statements permitting a specified degree of variation within languages. The idea is that anyone language selects just one of the small number of choices permitted by the theory of grammar. Examples include the Head Parameter, the Adjacency Parameter and the Pro-Drop Parameter.\n\nNotion in the theory of Universal Grammar (UG) and language acquisition. Parameters specify certain options that are not specified in UG. The values of parameters are not genetically fixed. Thus, language acquisition becomes a process of parameter setting. Linguistic diversity is characterized in terms of the values of parameters, for example the null subject parameter. Certain languages such as Italian and Spanish may have sentences with no overt subject, while other languages such as English must have an overt subject, even in cases in which this is nonreferential (dummy subject). Parameter theory, thus, provides an explanation for systematic syntactic variation between languages and imposes restrictions on the number of choices which the language learner has to make.\n"}

A largely National Bolshevik movement, it also has activists in France.\n\nThe PCN was founded in 1984 as a successor to the similar \"Parti Communautaire Européen\". The party bases its ideas on those of Jean-François Thiriart (who served as an advisor to Michel for a time after the foundation of the group) and seeks the creation of a single European state stretching entity from Russia to the Atlantic coast. Including activists with origins on both the far-right and far-left, it seeks to liberate Europe from its \"Yankee and Zionist enemies\". Indeed, Professor Piero Ignazi has defined the group as an heir to Thiriart's early influential organisation Jeune Europe. Its founding membership included both those whose background was neo-fascism and former Maoists. It has also been noted for giving support to controversial world leaders, most notably Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi. It also declared its support for ecologism. According to Eric Rossi, the PCN belongs to a strand of the Francophone far-right that he identifies as \"ethno-differentialist revolutionary nationalism\" in which he also includes Nouvelle Résistance, Groupe Union Défense, Troisième voie and Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne. He contrasts this with the \"exclusivist nationalists\" (as represented by Œuvre française) and the \"supremacist racialist nationalists\" (Fédération d'action nationale et européenne and Parti nationaliste français et européen), although including all three groups within a wider model of neo-fascism.\n\nThe party has from time to time contested elections in Belgium and France (without securing elected office), although at the last Belgian elections they told their supporters to vote for the Vlaams Belang.\n\nThe party is not connected to the European Community Party, a more recent initiative.\n\n"}

{"id": "41910525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41910525", "title": "Polish Library in Paris", "text": "Polish Library in Paris\n\nThe Polish Library in Paris (, ) is a Polish cultural centre of national importance and is closely associated both with the historic Great Emigration of the Polish élite to Paris in the 19th-century and the formation in 1832 of the Literary Society (\"Towarzystwo Literackie\"), later the Historical and Literary Society. The Library was founded in 1838 by Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Karol Sienkiewicz, among others. Its first task was to safeguard all surviving books, documents, archives and treasures of national significance. It has become a historical and documentary resource open for the use of Poles and other researchers and visitors. The Library houses three museums related to significant Polish artists: the Salon Frédéric Chopin, the Adam Mickiewicz Museum and the Bolesław Biegas Art collection. UNESCO's Memory of the World Register rates it as an institution unique of its kind.\n\nThe prime instigator for the creation of the Polish Library in Paris was Karol Sienkiewicz, who had managed to assemble the already existing book collections in the history and statistical departments of the\n\"Towarzystwo Literackie w Paryżu\", and the \"Towarzystwo Pomocy Naukowej\", the Polish Literary and Scientific Aid societies. A critical role in the venture was played by the French \"Société de Civilisation\", which, spurred on by the effect Adam Mickiewicz had with his article, \"Rabunek bibliotek i muzeów w Polsce\" - the pillage of libraries and museums in Poland - started a public appeal to garner support for a library dedicated to Poland. The act of foundation was signed in November 1838, followed in March 1839 by a gala opening of the building. A library committee consisting of eight delegates took on the running of the enterprise. Prince Czartoryski was elected as its life president, while the functions of secretary, librarian and treasurer were entrusted to Sienkiewicz.\n\nTo satisfy French legal requirements, Czartoryski took on formal ownership of the institution, thus securing its material survival. The initial plan was to erect a purpose-built Polish mansion in Paris to house the collections, but the shortage of funds led to the abandonment of that ambition, and instead a 17th-century four storey mansion was bought, on the Ile Saint-Louis along the Quai d'Orleans. The library moved into eleven rooms on the second floor while the rest of the building was let as accommodation to finance the loans that had been taken out. Meanwhile, the Library saw rapid expansion as gifts and legacies arrived from private individuals, for instance the collections of Małachowski, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Karol Kniaziewicz and Adam Mickiewicz. By 1845 the Library held 15,000 volumes and three years later, almost 20,000 items. In 1914 the collection contained 100,000 books. In addition, there was a stock of journals and reviews, of photographs, and of medals and coins.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the activities of the Literary Society had declined, and the maintenance of the library in Paris was transferred in 1893 to the responsibility of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters in Kraków. in 1926, Władysław Mickiewicz (son of Adam) bequeathed his important collection of manuscripts to the library. In the following period, a number of valuable books, manuscripts and artworks which the library could not properly maintain were sent to museums and institutions in the now independent Poland.\n\nOn the eve of World War II there were 145,000 books, 1,000 manuscripts, 12,000 images, 2,800 atlases and maps and 20,000 copies of documents relating to Polish history drawn from British and French archives. Although German occupying forces seized the library's collection during World War II, the Library was able to resume work with the liberation of Paris. Most of the looted materials were returned from Germany by 1947, however, the Library faced bitter legal battles with the post-war Communist Polish government over ownership. These were eventually resolved in the Library's favour in 1959. Following Poland's return to democracy in 1989, links were reestablished with the new Polish government.\n\nThe Polish Library in Paris is the oldest cultural institution outside the territory of Poland. Since 1854 the Library has occupied the entire original building. Next to the Library are the premises of the Adam Mickiewicz Museum, Paris, opened in 1903. Attached, are also the Salon Frédéric Chopin, the only permanent exhibition in Paris to the memory of the composer and the Musée Boleslas Biegas with paintings and sculpture by the artist and other Polish artists.\n\nIn 1989 the collection had grown to 220,000 volumes, around 5,000 Polish maps, 7,000 16th - 20th century images, plus the collections of the \"Towarzystwo Historyczno-Literackie w Paryżu\".\n\nAlthough in 1893 the Library came under the predecessor of the Polish Academy of Learning in Kraków, at that time in partitioned Poland, this did not resolve its relationship with the Library's neighbour and founding institution in Paris, the Historical and Literary Society, (Fr.: Société Historique et Littéraire Polonaise -SHLP). Not until 2004, after a process of arbitration, was it formally agreed that the Library is jointly \"owned\" by both organisations, through the mechanism of the \"Association de la Bibliothèque Polonaise de Paris\", in effect a governing council, composed of seven delegates from each of the two \"parent\" institutions. Typically, these are people with distinguished academic credentials from France or Poland. The chairman of the association, or governing council of the Library, is elected for a term of 5 years and is currently C. Pierre Zaleski, from the Polish Academy of Learning. He is also the chief executive of the Library and heads a professional management team for its day-to-day running.\n\nThe Library and its part-owner, the Historical and Literary Society, are jointly members of the Standing Conference of [Polish] Museums, Archives and Libraries in the West[ern hemisphere]. This body groups all recognised collections outside Poland, but it does not cover items held in foreign institutions, nor the many thousands of objects as yet unrecovered from war-time looting and displacement.\n\nIn the present economic decline, although partly funded from Poland's higher education budget, the Library faces continuous challenges as maintenance costs rise, materials age and cultural institutions face financial competition from other social priorities and needs, not least digital ones. There is currently pressure on the Polish collection at Rapperswil Castle to leave its premises in Switzerland. This bodes ill for other such centres which may be obliged either to be scattered or receive more fragile materials, as has already disastrously happened in the case of the decimated Polish Museum at Fawley Court, England.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "355033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355033", "title": "Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence", "text": "Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence\n\nThe Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) was a statement adopted by the Cabinet of Rhodesia on 11 November 1965, announcing that Rhodesia, a British territory in southern Africa that had governed itself since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent sovereign state. The culmination of a protracted dispute between the British and Rhodesian governments regarding the terms under which the latter could become fully independent, it was the first unilateral break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies since the United States Declaration of Independence nearly two centuries before. The UK, the Commonwealth and the United Nations all deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions, the first in the UN's history, were imposed on the breakaway colony. Amid near-complete international isolation, Rhodesia continued as an unrecognised state with the assistance of South Africa and Portugal.\n\nThe Rhodesian government, which mostly comprised members of the country's white minority of about 5%, was indignant when, amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, less developed African colonies to the north without comparable experience of self-rule quickly advanced to independence during the early 1960s while Rhodesia was refused sovereignty under the newly ascendant principle of \"no independence before majority rule\" (\"NIBMAR\"). Most white Rhodesians felt that they were due independence following four decades' self-government, and that the British government was betraying them by withholding it. This combined with the colonial government's acute reluctance to hand over power to black Rhodesians—the manifestation of racial tensions, Cold War anti-communism and the fear that a dystopian Congo-style situation might result—to create the impression that if the UK did not grant independence, Rhodesia might be justified in taking it unilaterally.\n\nA stalemate developed between the British and Rhodesian prime ministers, Harold Wilson and Ian Smith respectively, between 1964 and 1965. Dispute largely surrounded the British condition that the terms for independence had to be acceptable \"to the people of the country as a whole\"; Smith contended that this was met, while the UK and black Rhodesian leaders held that it was not. After Wilson proposed in late October 1965 that the UK might safeguard future black representation in the Rhodesian parliament by withdrawing some of the colonial government's devolved powers, then presented terms for an investigatory Royal Commission that the Rhodesians found unacceptable, Smith and his Cabinet declared independence. Calling this treasonous, the British colonial governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, formally dismissed Smith and his government, but they ignored him and appointed an \"Officer Administering the Government\" to take his place.\n\nWhile no country recognised the UDI, the Rhodesian High Court deemed the post-UDI government legal and \"de jure\" in 1968. The Smith administration initially professed continued loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II, but abandoned this in 1970 when it declared a republic in an unsuccessful attempt to win foreign recognition. The Rhodesian Bush War, a guerrilla conflict between the government and two rival communist-backed black Rhodesian groups, began in earnest two years later, and after several attempts to end the war Smith concluded the Internal Settlement with non-militant nationalists in 1978. Under these terms the country was reconstituted under black rule as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979, but this new order was rejected by the guerrillas and the international community. The Bush War continued until Zimbabwe Rhodesia revoked its UDI as part of the Lancaster House Agreement in December 1979. Following a brief period of direct British rule, the country was granted internationally recognised independence under the name Zimbabwe in 1980.\n\nThe southern African territory of Rhodesia, officially Southern Rhodesia, was a unique case in the British Empire and Commonwealth—though a colony in name, it was internally self-governing and constitutionally not unlike a dominion. This situation dated back to 1923, when it was granted responsible government within the Empire as a self-governing colony, following three decades of administration and development by the British South Africa Company. Britain had intended Southern Rhodesia's integration into the Union of South Africa as a new province, but this having been rejected by registered voters in the 1922 government referendum, the territory was moulded into a prospective dominion instead. It was empowered to run its own affairs in almost all respects, including defence.\n\nWhitehall's powers over Southern Rhodesia under the 1923 constitution were, on paper, considerable; the British Crown was theoretically able to cancel any passed bill within a year, or alter the constitution however it wished. These reserved powers were intended to protect the indigenous black Africans from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as Claire Palley comments in her constitutional history of the country, it would have been extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce such actions, and attempting to do so would have probably caused a crisis. In the event, they were never exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in Salisbury, and dispute was rare.\n\nThe 1923 constitution was drawn up in non-racial terms, and the electoral system it devised was similarly open, at least in theory. Voting qualifications regarding personal income, education and property, similar to those of the Cape Qualified Franchise, were applied equally to all, but since most blacks did not meet the set standards, both the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly from the white minority of about 5%. The result was that black interests were sparsely represented if at all, something that most of the colony's whites showed little interest in changing; they claimed that most blacks were uninterested in Western-style political process and that they would not govern properly if they took over. Bills such as the Land Apportionment Act of 1930, which earmarked about half of the country for white ownership and residence while dividing the rest into black purchase, tribal trust and national areas, were variously biased towards the white minority. White settlers and their offspring provided most of the colony's administrative, industrial, scientific and farming skills, and built a relatively balanced, partially industrialised market economy, boasting strong agricultural and manufacturing sectors, iron and steel industries and modern mining enterprises. Everyday life was marked by discrimination ranging from job reservation for whites to petty segregation of trains, post office queues and the like. Whites owned most of the best farmland, and had far superior education, wages and homes, but the schooling, healthcare, infrastructure and salaries available to black Rhodesians were nevertheless very good by African standards.\n\nIn the wider Imperial context, Southern Rhodesia occupied a category unto itself because of the \"special quasi-independent status\" it held. The Dominions Office, formed in 1925 to handle British relations with the dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa and the Irish Free State, also dealt with Southern Rhodesia, and Imperial Conferences included the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister alongside those of the dominions from 1932. This unique arrangement continued following the advent of Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences in 1944. Southern Rhodesians of all races fought for Britain in the Second World War, and the colonial government gradually received more autonomy regarding external affairs. During the immediate post-war years, Southern Rhodesian politicians generally thought that they were as good as independent as they were, and that full autonomy in the form of dominionship would make little difference to them. Post-war immigration to Southern Rhodesia, mainly from Britain, Ireland and South Africa, caused the white community to swell from 68,954 in 1941 to 221,504 in 1961. The black population grew from 1,400,000 to 3,550,000 over the same period.\n\nBelieving full dominion status to be effectively symbolic and \"there for the asking\", Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins (in office from 1933 to 1953) twice ignored British overtures hinting at dominionship, and instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two colonies directly administered from London. He hoped that this might set in motion the creation of one united dominion in south-central Africa, emulating the Federation of Australia half a century before. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, defined in its constitution as indissoluble, began in 1953, mandated by the results of a mostly white referendum, with Southern Rhodesia, the most developed of the three territories, at its head, Huggins as Federal Prime Minister and Salisbury as Federal capital.\n\nComing at the start of the decolonisation period, the Federation of self-governing Southern Rhodesia with two directly ruled British protectorates was later described by the British historian Robert Blake as \"an aberration of history—a curious deviation from the inevitable course of events\". The project faced black opposition from the start, and ultimately failed because of the shifting international attitudes and rising black Rhodesian ambitions of the late 1950s and early 1960s, often collectively called the Wind of Change. Britain, France and Belgium vastly accelerated their withdrawal from Africa during this period, believing colonial rule to be no longer sustainable geopolitically or ethically. The idea of \"no independence before majority rule\", commonly abbreviated to \"NIBMAR\", gained considerable ground in British political circles. When Huggins (who had been recently ennobled as Lord Malvern) asked Britain to make the Federation a dominion in 1956, he was rebuffed. The opposition Dominion Party responded by repeatedly calling for a Federal unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) over the next few years. Following Lord Malvern's retirement in late 1956, his successor Sir Roy Welensky pondered such a move on at least three occasions.\n\nAttempting to advance the case for Southern Rhodesian independence, particularly in the event of Federal dissolution, the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead brokered the 1961 constitution with Britain, which he thought would remove all British powers of reservation over Southern Rhodesian bills and acts, and put the country on the brink of full sovereignty. Despite its containing no independence guarantees, Whitehead, Welensky and other proponents of this constitution presented it to the Southern Rhodesian electorate as the \"independence constitution\" under which Southern Rhodesia would become a dominion on a par with Australia, Canada and New Zealand if the Federation dissolved. White dissenters included Ian Smith, MP for Gwanda and Chief Whip for the governing United Federal Party (UFP) in the Federal Assembly, who took exception to the constitution's omission of an explicit promise of Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution, and ultimately resigned his post in protest. A referendum of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961. The final version of the constitution included a few extra provisions inserted by the British, one of which—Section 111—reserved full powers to the Crown to amend, add to or revoke certain sections of the Southern Rhodesian constitution by Order in Council at the request of the British government. This effectively negated the relinquishment of British powers described elsewhere in the document, but the Southern Rhodesians did not initially notice it.\n\nThe black Rhodesian movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites during the late 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential black voters that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo trade unionist Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and by the start of 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective black voters impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.\n\nMeanwhile, secessionist black Rhodesian parties won electoral victories in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and Harold Macmillan's Conservative administration in Britain moved towards breaking up the Federation, resolving that it had become untenable. In February 1962, the British Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Duncan Sandys, secretly informed the Nyasaland nationalist leader Hastings Banda that secession would be allowed. A few days later, he horrified Welensky by telling him that \"we British have lost the will to govern\". \"But we haven't\", retorted Julian Greenfield, Welensky's Law Minister. Macmillan's Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State, R A Butler, who headed British oversight of the Federation, officially announced Nyasaland's right to secede in December 1962. Four months later, he informed the three territories that he was going to convene a conference to decide the Federation's future.\n\nAs Southern Rhodesia had been the UK's legislative partner in forming the Federation in 1953, it would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation. Field could therefore potentially hamstring the British by refusing to attend the conference until they pledged to grant his country full independence. According to Field, Smith and other RF politicians, Butler made several such guarantees orally to ensure their co-operation at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. The Southern Rhodesians claimed that Butler justified his refusal to give a written promise by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's \"spirit of trust\"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. \"Let's remember the trust you emphasised\", Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; \"if you break that you will live to regret it.\" Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, which was held at Victoria Falls over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of the year. In the House of Commons afterwards, Butler flatly denied suggestions that he had \"oiled the wheels\" of Federal dissolution with secret promises to the Southern Rhodesians.\n\nField's government was startled by Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised that it was going to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.\n\nThe British government's refusal to grant independence to Southern Rhodesia under the 1961 constitution was largely the result of the geopolitical and moral shifts associated with the Wind of Change, coupled with the UK's wish to avoid opprobrium and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. The issue gained international attention in Africa and worldwide as a flashpoint for questions of decolonisation and racism. By the early 1960s, general consensus in the post-colonial UN—particularly the General Assembly, where the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby were collectively very strong—roundly denounced all forms of colonialism, and supported communist-backed black Rhodesian insurgencies across southern Africa, regarding them as racial liberation movements. Amid the Cold War, Britain opposed the spread of Soviet and Chinese influence into Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly expressed reservations or backed down on NIBMAR in the Southern Rhodesia question. Once the topic of Southern Rhodesia came to the fore in the UN and other bodies, particularly the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), even maintaining the \"status quo\" became regarded as unacceptable internationally, causing the UK government a great deal of embarrassment.\n\nIn the Commonwealth context, too, Britain knew that simply granting independence to Southern Rhodesia was out of the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.\n\nAt party level, the Labour Party, in opposition until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and supportive of the black Rhodesian movement on ideological and moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more sympathetic to the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.\n\nThe Southern Rhodesian government found it bizarre that Britain was making independent states out of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, less developed territories with little experience of self-rule, while withholding sovereign statehood from Southern Rhodesia, the Federation's senior partner, which had already been self-governing for four decades and which was one of the most prosperous and developed countries in Africa. The principle of majority rule, the basis for this apparent inconsistency, was considered irrelevant by the Southern Rhodesians. They had presumed that in the event of Federal dissolution they would be first in line for independence without major adjustments to the 1961 constitution, an impression confirmed to them by prior intergovernmental correspondence, particularly the oral promises they claimed to have received from Butler. When it did not prove forthcoming they felt cheated. Salisbury contended that its predominantly white legislature was more deserving of independence than the untried black Rhodesian leaders as it had proven its competence over decades of self-rule.\n\nThe RF claimed that the bloody civil wars, military coups and other disasters that plagued the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black Rhodesian leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the Congo, it presented chaotic doomsday scenarios of what black Rhodesian rule in Southern Rhodesia might mean, particularly for the white community. Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black Rhodesian grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony's proud war record on Britain's behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War context to form an anti-communist, pro-Western front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.\n\nThese factors combined with what RF politicians and supporters saw as British decadence, chicanery and betrayal to create the case they put forward that UDI, while dubious legally and likely to provoke international uproar, might nevertheless be in their eyes justifiable and necessary for the good of the country and region if an accommodation could not be found with Whitehall.\n\nField's failure to secure independence concurrently with the end of the Federation caused his Cabinet's support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction with him on the grounds that the British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.\n\nThe RF united behind Field after Sandys wrote him a terse letter warning him of the likely Commonwealth reaction to a declaration of independence, but the Prime Minister then lost his party's confidence by failing to pursue a possible route to at least \"de facto\" independence devised by Desmond Lardner-Burke, a lawyer and RF MP for Gwelo. During March 1964, the Legislative Assembly in Salisbury considered and passed Lardner-Burke's motion that the Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, should submit a petition to the Queen requesting alteration of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution so that the Royal Assent described therein would be exercised at the request of the Southern Rhodesian government rather than that of its British counterpart. This would both remove the possibility of British legislative interference and pave the way for an attempted assumption of independence by Order in Council.\n\nThe RF's intention was partly to test whether or not the British would attempt to block this bill after Gibbs had granted Royal Assent to it, but this issue never came to a head because Sandys persuaded Field not to forward it to Gibbs for ratification on the grounds that it had not been unanimously passed. Lord Salisbury, one of Southern Rhodesia's main supporters in Britain, despaired at Field's lack of action, telling Welensky that as he saw it \"the simple time to have declared independence, whether right or wrong, would have been when the Federation came to an end\". The RF hierarchy interpreted this latest backtrack by Field as evidence that he would not seriously challenge the British on the independence issue, and forced his resignation on 13 April 1964. Smith accepted the Cabinet's nomination to take his place.\n\nSmith, a farmer from the Midlands town of Selukwe who had been seriously wounded while serving in the British Royal Air Force during the Second World War, was Southern Rhodesia's first native-born Prime Minister. Regarded in British political circles as a \"raw colonial\"—when he took over, Smith's personal experience of the UK comprised four brief visits—he promised a harder line than Field in independence talks. The RF's replacement of Field drew criticism from the British Labour Party, whose leader Harold Wilson called it \"brutal\", while Nkomo described the new Smith Cabinet as \"a suicide squad ... not interested in the welfare of all the people but only in their own\". Smith said he was pursuing a middle course between black Rhodesian rule and apartheid so that there would still be \"a place for the white man\" in Southern Rhodesia; this would benefit the blacks too, he claimed. He held that the government should be based \"on merit, not on colour or nationalism\", and insisted that there would be \"no African nationalist government here in my lifetime\".\n\nSalisbury's blunt refusal to be part of the Wind of Change caused the Southern Rhodesian military's traditional British and American suppliers to impose an informal embargo, and prompted Whitehall and Washington to stop sending Southern Rhodesia financial aid around the same time. In June 1964, Douglas-Home informed Smith that Southern Rhodesia would not be represented at the year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, despite Salisbury's record of attendance going back to 1932, because of a change in policy to only include representatives from fully independent states. This decision, taken by Britain to preempt the possibility of open confrontation with Asian and black African leaders at the conference, deeply insulted Smith. Lord Malvern equated Britain's removal of Southern Rhodesia's conference seat with \"kicking us out of the Commonwealth\", while Welensky expressed horror at what he described as \"this cavalier treatment of a country which has, since its creation, staunchly supported, in every possible way, Britain and the Commonwealth\".\nAt 10 Downing Street in early September 1964, impasse developed between Douglas-Home and Smith over the best way to measure black public opinion in Southern Rhodesia. A key plank of Britain's Southern Rhodesia policy was that the terms for independence had to be \"acceptable to the people of the country as a whole\"—agreeing to this, Smith suggested that white and urban black opinion could be gauged through a general referendum of registered voters, and that rural black views could be obtained at a national \"indaba\" (tribal conference) of chiefs and headmen. Douglas-Home told Smith that although this proposal satisfied him personally, he could not accept it as he did not believe the Commonwealth, the United Nations or the Labour Party would also do so. He stressed that such a move towards accommodation with Smith might hurt the Conservatives' chances in the British general election the next month, and suggested that it might be in Smith's best interests to wait until after the election to continue negotiations. Smith accepted this argument. Douglas-Home assured Smith that a Conservative government would settle with him and grant independence within a year.\n\nAttempting to form a viable white opposition to the Rhodesian Front, the UFP resurrected itself around Welensky, renamed itself the Rhodesia Party, and entered the Arundel and Avondale by-elections that had been called for 1 October 1964. Perturbed by the prospect of having to face the political heavyweight Welensky in parliament at the head of the opposition, the RF poured huge resources into winning both of these former UFP safe seats, and fielded Clifford Dupont, Smith's deputy, against Welensky in Arundel. The RF won both seats comfortably, and the Rhodesia Party soon faded away. Spurred on by this success, Smith organised the \"indaba\" for 22 October, and called a general independence referendum for 5 November 1964. Meanwhile, Wilson wrote a number of letters to black Southern Rhodesians, assuring them that \"the Labour Party is totally opposed to granting independence to Southern Rhodesia so long as the government of that country remains under the control of the white minority\".\n\nLabour defeated the Conservatives by four seats in the British general election on 15 October 1964, and formed a government the next day. Both Labour and the Conservatives told Smith that a positive result at the \"indaba\" would not be recognised by Britain as representative of the people, and the Conservatives turned down Salisbury's invitation to send observers. Smith pressed on, telling parliament that he would ask the tribal chiefs and headmen \"to consult their people in the traditional manner\", then hold the \"indaba\" as planned. On 22 October, 196 chiefs and 426 headmen from across the country gathered at Domboshawa, just north-east of Salisbury, and began their deliberations. Smith hoped that Britain, having taken part in such \"indabas\" in the past, might send a delegation at the last minute, but none arrived, much to his annoyance, particularly as the British government's Commonwealth Secretary Arthur Bottomley was only across the Zambezi in Lusaka at the time.\n\nWhile the chiefs conferred, Northern Rhodesia became independent Zambia on 24 October 1964, emulating Nyasaland, which had achieved statehood as Malawi three months earlier. Reasoning that it was no longer necessary to refer to itself as \"Southern\" in the absence of a northern counterpart, Southern Rhodesia began calling itself simply Rhodesia. The same day, the commander of the Rhodesian Army, Major-General John \"Jock\" Anderson, resigned, announcing publicly that he was doing so because of his opposition to UDI, which he said he could not go along with because of his oath of allegiance to the Queen. Interpreting this as a sign that Smith intended to declare independence if a majority backed it in the referendum, Wilson wrote a stiff letter to Smith on 25 October, warning him of the consequences of UDI, and demanding \"a categorical assurance forthwith that no attempt at a unilateral declaration of independence on your part will be made\". Smith expressed confusion as to what he had done to provoke this, and ignored it.\n\nWhen the \"indaba\" ended on 26 October, the chiefs and headmen returned a unanimous decision to support the government's stand for independence under the 1961 constitution, attesting in their report that \"people who live far away do not understand the problems of our country\". This verdict was rejected by the nationalist movement on the grounds that the chiefs received governmental salaries; the chiefs countered that the black MPs in parliamentary opposition also received such salaries, but still opposed the government. Malvern, who was becoming perturbed by the RF's actions, dismissed the \"indaba\" as a \"swindle\", asserting that the chiefs no longer had any real power; the British simply ignored the whole exercise. On 27 October, Wilson released a firm statement regarding Britain's intended response to UDI, warning that Rhodesia's economic and political ties with Britain, the Commonwealth and most of the world would be immediately severed amid a campaign of sanctions if Smith's government went ahead with UDI. This was intended to discourage white Rhodesians from voting for independence in the referendum, for which the RF campaign slogan was \"Yes means Unity, not UDI\". Wilson was pleased when Douglas-Home, his leading opponent in the House of Commons, praised the statement as \"rough but right\". On 5 November 1964, Rhodesia's mostly white electorate voted \"yes\" to independence under the 1961 constitution by a margin of 89%, prompting Smith to declare that the British condition of acceptability to the people as a whole had been met.\n\nSmith wrote to Wilson the day after the referendum, asking him to send Bottomley to Salisbury for talks. Wilson replied that Smith should instead come to London. The British and Rhodesians exchanged often confrontational letters for the next few months. Alluding to the British financial aid pledged to Salisbury as part of the Federal dissolution arrangements, Wilson's High Commissioner in Salisbury, J B Johnston, wrote to the Rhodesian Cabinet Secretary Gerald B Clarke on 23 December that \"talk of a unilateral declaration of independence is bound to throw a shadow of uncertainty on the future financial relations between the two governments\". Smith was furious, seeing this as blackmail, and on 13 January 1965 wrote to Wilson: \"I am so incensed at the line of your High Commissioner's letter that I am replying directly to you ... It would appear that any undertakings given by the British government are worthless ... such immoral behaviour on the part of the British government makes it impossible for me to continue negotiations with you with any confidence that our standards of fair play, honesty and decency will prevail.\"\nThe two premiers were brought together in person in late January 1965, when Smith travelled to London for Sir Winston Churchill's funeral. Following an episode concerning Smith's non-invitation to a luncheon at Buckingham Palace after the funeral—noticing the Rhodesian's absence, the Queen sent a royal equerry to Smith's hotel to retrieve him, reportedly causing Wilson much irritation—the two Prime Ministers inconclusively debated at 10 Downing Street. They differed on most matters, but agreed on a visit to Rhodesia the next month by Bottomley and the Lord Chancellor, Lord Gardiner, to gauge public opinion and meet political and commercial figures. Bottomley and Gardiner visited Rhodesia from 22 February to 3 March, collected a wide cross-section of opinions, including some from black Rhodesians, and on returning to Britain reported to the House of Commons that they were \"not without hope of finding a way towards a solution that will win the support of all communities and lead to independence and prosperity for all Rhodesians\". Bottomley also condemned black-on-black political violence, and dismissed the idea of introducing majority rule through military force.\n\nThe RF called a new general election for May 1965 and, campaigning on an election promise of independence, won all 50 \"A\"-roll seats (the voters for which were mostly white). Josiah Gondo, leader of the United People's Party, became Rhodesia's first black Leader of the Opposition. Opening parliament on 9 June, Gibbs told the Legislative Assembly that the RF's strengthened majority amounted to \"a mandate to lead the country to its full independence\", and announced that the new government had informed him of its intent to open its own diplomatic mission in Lisbon, separate from the British embassy there. The British and Rhodesians argued about this unilateral act by Salisbury, described by the historian J R T Wood as the \"veritable straw in the wind\", alongside the independence issue until Portugal accepted the mission in late September, much to Britain's fury and Rhodesia's delight. Hoping to bring Smith to heel by stonewalling him, Wilson's ministers deliberately delayed and frustrated the Rhodesian government in negotiations. Rhodesia was again excluded from the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in 1965. The UK's refusal of aid, the Lisbon mission, the informal arms embargo and other issues combined with this to cause the Rhodesian government's sense of alienation from Britain and the Commonwealth to deepen. In his memoirs, Smith accused the British of \"resorting to politics of convenience and appeasement\". Wilson, meanwhile, became exasperated by what he saw as Rhodesian inflexibility, describing the gap between the two governments as \"between different worlds and different centuries\".\n\nAmid renewed rumours of an impending Rhodesian UDI, Smith travelled to meet Wilson in London at the start of October 1965, telling the press that he intended to resolve the independence issue once and for all. Both the British and the Rhodesians were surprised by the large numbers of Britons who came out to support Smith during his visit. Smith accepted an invitation from the BBC to appear on its \"Twenty-Four Hours\" evening news and current affairs programme, but Downing Street blocked this at the last minute. Following largely abortive talks with Wilson, the Rhodesian Prime Minister flew home on 12 October. Desperate to avert UDI, Wilson travelled to Salisbury two weeks later to continue negotiations.\n\nDuring these discussions, Smith referred to the last resort of a UDI on many occasions, though he said he hoped to find another way out of the quandary. He offered to increase black legislative representation by expanding the electorate along the lines of \"one taxpayer, one vote\"—which would enfranchise about half a million, but still leave most of the nation voteless—in return for a grant of independence. Wilson said this was insufficient, and countered that future black representation might be better safeguarded by Britain's withdrawal from the colonial government of the power it had held since 1923 to determine the size and makeup of its parliament. The Rhodesians were horrified by this prospect, particularly as Wilson's suggestion of it seemed to them to have removed the failsafe alternative of keeping the \"status quo\". Before the British Prime Minister left Rhodesia on 30 October 1965, he proposed a Royal Commission to gauge public opinion in the colony regarding independence under the 1961 constitution, possibly chaired by the Rhodesian Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle, which would report its findings to both the British and Rhodesian Cabinets. Wilson confirmed in the House of Commons two days later that he intended to introduce direct British control over the Rhodesian parliamentary structure to ensure that progress was made towards majority rule.\n\nStalemate drew closer as the Rhodesian Cabinet resolved that since Wilson had ruled out maintenance of the \"status quo\", its only remaining options were to trust in the Royal Commission or declare independence. When the terms for the commission's visit were presented to Smith, he found that contrary to what had been discussed during the British Prime Minister's visit, the Royal Commission would operate on the basis that the 1961 constitution was unacceptable to the British government, and that Britain would not commit itself to accepting the final report. Smith said these conditions amounted to a \"vote of no confidence in [the commission] before they commenced\", and therefore rejected them. \"The impression you left with us of a determined effort to resolve our constitutional problem has been utterly dissipated\", he wrote to Wilson on 5 November. \"It would seem that you have now finally closed the door which you publicly claimed to have opened.\"\n\nAmid frantic efforts by Beadle and others on both sides to revive the Royal Commission, the Rhodesian government had Gibbs announce a state of emergency the same day on the grounds that black Rhodesian insurgents were reportedly entering the country. Smith denied that this foreshadowed a declaration of independence, but the publishing of his letter to Wilson in the press provoked a worldwide storm of speculation that UDI was imminent. Smith wrote again to Wilson on 8 November, asking him to appoint the Royal Commission under the terms they had agreed in Salisbury and to commit the British government to accepting its ruling, but Wilson did not immediately reply. On 9 November, the Rhodesian Cabinet sent a letter to Queen Elizabeth II, assuring her that Rhodesia would remain loyal to her personally \"whatever happens\".\n\nThe Rhodesian Minister for Justice and Law and Order, Desmond Lardner-Burke, presented the rest of the Cabinet with a draft for the declaration of independence on 5 November 1965. When Jack Howman, Minister of Tourism and Information, said that he was also preparing a draft, the Cabinet decided to wait to see his version too. The ministers agreed that if an independence proclamation were issued, they would all sign it. On 9 November, the Cabinet jointly devised an outline for the proclamation document and the accompanying statement to be made by Smith. The final version of the declaration of independence was prepared by a sub-committee of civil servants headed by Gerald Clarke, the Cabinet Secretary, with the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776, the only other such proclamation ever issued by British colonials, used as a model. Strongly alluding to Thomas Jefferson's text throughout, the Rhodesians used one phrase verbatim—\"a respect for the opinions of mankind\"—but no reference was made to the assertion that \"all men are created equal\", nor to the \"consent of the governed\", two omissions later stressed by a number of commentators.\n\nAttached to the declaration of independence was a copy of the 1961 constitution amended for the circumstances, which became the 1965 constitution. In the eyes of the Smith administration, this document removed Whitehall's remaining authority over Rhodesia. However, the Smith government still professed loyalty to Elizabeth II, and accordingly the document reconstituted Rhodesia as a dominion with Elizabeth as \"Queen of Rhodesia\". The new constitution created the concept of allegiance to the \"Constitution of Rhodesia,\" and introduced the post of Officer Administering the Government, a viceregal figure empowered to sign passed legislation into law on behalf of the monarch if she did not appoint a Governor-General.\n\nThe Rhodesian Cabinet waited in vain for Wilson's reply for the rest of 9 November and the next day. After briefly meeting Smith late on 10 November, Johnston warned Wilson that evening that the Rhodesians seemed poised to declare independence in the morning. The British Prime Minister tried repeatedly to call Smith, but did not get through until Smith was already chairing a Cabinet meeting on the independence issue around 08:00 Central Africa Time (06:00 in London) on 11 November. Wilson attempted to talk Smith out of unilateral action by telling him the \"status quo\" could continue, and the two argued inconclusively about the proposed Royal Commission. Returning to his Cabinet meeting, Smith reported the conversation to his ministers, and, after debating for a while, the Cabinet came to the conclusion that Wilson was simply attempting to buy more time and that there was no sign of actual progress. Smith asked if Rhodesia should declare its independence, and had each Cabinet minister answer in turn. According to Smith's account, \"each one, quietly but firmly, without hesitation, said: 'Yes'.\"\n\nAt 11:00 local time on 11 November 1965, Armistice Day, during the traditional two minutes' silence to remember the fallen of the two World Wars, Smith declared Rhodesia independent and signed the proclamation document, with Dupont and the other 10 ministers of the Cabinet following. The timing was intended to emphasise the sacrifices Rhodesia had made for Britain in wartime. As Ken Flower later said, \"the rebellion was made to appear as though it was not a rebellion\". Smith and his ministers still pledged allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, whose official portrait hung prominently behind them as they signed; the declaration even ended \"God Save The Queen\". Four junior members of the Cabinet—Lance Smith, Ian Dillon, Andrew Dunlop and P K van der Byl—did not sign, but were included in the official photograph.\n\nPrompted by the government, the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation told the public to stand by for an important announcement from the Prime Minister at 13:15 local time. Smith went first to Government House to inform Gibbs that his Cabinet had declared independence, then to Pockets Hill Studios in east Salisbury to announce UDI to the nation. He read the proclamation aloud, then stated that independence had been declared because it had become \"abundantly clear that it is the policy of the British government to play us along with no real intention of arriving at a solution which we could possibly accept ... I promised the people of this country that I would continue to negotiate to the bitter end and that I would leave no stone unturned in my endeavours to secure an honourable and mutually accepted settlement; it now falls to me to tell you that negotiations have come to an end\".\n\nSmith said that he believed that he would be remiss in his duty if he allowed Rhodesia to continue to \"drift in its present paralysing state of uncertainty\", and that following Britain's abandonment of the Federation his government was determined that \"the same will never be allowed to happen here\". He claimed that UDI did not mark \"a diminution in the opportunities which our African people have to advance and prosper in Rhodesia\", described \"racial harmony in Africa\" as part of his agenda and condemned black Rhodesian activities as attempts to \"blackmail the British government into ... handing the country over to irresponsible rule\". He then attempted to assuage fears that economic sanctions might destroy the economy, and asked Rhodesians to stand firm: \"The mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders ... In the lives of most nations there comes a moment when a stand has to be made for principles, whatever the consequences. This moment has come to Rhodesia ... the first Western nation in the last two decades to say 'so far and no further'.\" He concluded with an assertion that the declaration of independence was \"a blow for the preservation of justice, civilisation and Christianity\".\n\nBy the time Smith and Dupont arrived at Government House to see Gibbs, Whitehall had instructed the Governor to formally dismiss Smith and his ministers for treason. Gibbs complied without hesitation. Smith and his ministers ignored this, holding that under the new 1965 constitution Gibbs \"no longer ha[d] any executive powers in Rhodesia\", and his reserve power to sack them no longer existed. The Rhodesian government hoped that Gibbs might obligingly resign in light of his impotent situation, but he did not; following orders from London, he remained at his post at Government House. Gibbs told the Rhodesian military's senior officers, some of whom were troubled by the perceived choice between Queen and country, to remain at their posts to maintain law and order. Wilson briefly flirted with the idea of sending Lord Mountbatten to Rhodesia to support Gibbs as a direct representative of the Queen, but this was dropped after Gibbs asked for somebody \"higher up\" in the royal family instead. \"Not likely\", Wilson retorted.\n\nThe Rhodesian government accompanied UDI with emergency measures that it said were intended to prevent alarm, unrest and the flight of people and capital. Press censorship and petrol rationing were imposed, import licences were cancelled and emigration allowances were cut to £100. News of UDI was generally received calmly by the local citizenry, apart from some isolated incidents of passing cars being stoned in the black townships outside Bulawayo. A few expected dissenters were arrested, most prominently Leo Baron, Nkomo's lawyer, whose links with black Rhodesians and communists were seen by authorities as \"subversive\". Baron, the younger brother of the scientist Jacob Bronowski, was arrested nine minutes after UDI was made.\n\nWelensky, who had opposed UDI, stated that he felt it was nevertheless \"the duty of every responsible Rhodesian to support the revolutionary government\" as he believed the only alternative was a descent into anarchy. João de Freitas Cruz, the Portuguese consul-general in Salisbury, reacted to the news with wild excitement; visiting the Smith residence later in the day, he declared \"Only Rhodesians could do this!\" A statement from ZAPU's Jason Moyo, who was in London at the time, denounced UDI as an act of \"treason and rebellion\" and asserted that \"the lives particularly of four million unarmed Africans are in jeopardy\". Davis M'Gabe of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) said that \"For all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life, UDI has set a collision course which cannot be altered. [It has] marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom ... from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle.\" Most major Christian denominational leaders in the country publicly rejected UDI and the assertion that it defended Christianity, with the exception of the local Dutch Reformed Church, which stated that it was apolitical and thereafter refrained from comment.\n\nA week after UDI, Smith's government announced that Dupont, the Deputy Prime Minister, had resigned from the Cabinet to accept the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution. Smith asked the Queen by letter to appoint a Governor-General to supersede Gibbs, recommending Dupont, but was ignored. Dupont nevertheless effectively replaced the Governor. The Smith administration assigned him the Governor's official residence at Government House, but no attempt was made to forcibly remove Gibbs and his entourage; the post-UDI government stated that the Officer Administering the Government would live at Governor's Lodge instead \"until Government House, at present temporarily occupied by Sir Humphrey Gibbs in a private capacity, becomes available\".\n\nThe Speaker of the Rhodesian parliament, A R W Stumbles, reconvened the Legislative Assembly on 25 November, resolving that if he did not there would be chaos. He feared that Gibbs might dramatically walk into the chamber in an attempt to stop the proceedings, but Gibbs did no such thing. The parliamentary opposition opened the meeting by asking whether the assembly was legal. Ahrn Palley, the lone white opposition MP, announced that as he saw it, \"certain Honourable Members in collusion have torn up the constitution under which this House meets. The proceedings have no legal validity whatsoever\". Stumbles overruled this objection and two more interruptions from Palley, and suggested that any members with reservations might leave. Palley continued his loud protests until he was forcibly ejected by the Sergeant-at-Arms, shouting \"This is an illegal assembly! God save the Queen!\" Gondo and eight other opposition MPs followed Palley out; all ten of them rejoined the Legislative Assembly in February 1966.\n\nGibbs received threatening letters from the Rhodesian public, and on 26 November 1965 Smith's government cut off the telephones at Government House, and removed the ceremonial guard, the official cars \"and even the typewriters\", Wood records. Gibbs nevertheless refused to step down or to leave Government House, issuing a statement that he would remain there \"as the lawful Governor of Rhodesia until such time as constitutional government is restored, which I hope will be soon.\" He stayed at his post, ignored by the post-UDI government, until the declaration of a republic in 1970.\n\nWilson was astonished by Smith's actions, and found the timing of the declaration to coincide with the Armistice Day silence deeply insulting. Describing Salisbury as \"hell-bent on illegal self-destroying\", the British Prime Minister, supported in the Commons by the Liberals and most Conservatives, called on Rhodesians to ignore the post-UDI government. Within hours of UDI, the UN General Assembly passed a condemnatory resolution, by 107-to-two—South Africa and Portugal voted against, and France abstained—decrying Rhodesia's actions and calling on Britain to end \"the rebellion by the unlawful authorities in Salisbury\". The UN Security Council the next day adopted Resolution 216, which denounced the declaration of independence as illegal and racist, and called on all states to refuse recognition and assistance to the Rhodesian government. Security Council Resolution 217, following on 20 November, condemned UDI as an illegitimate \"usurpation of power by a racist settler minority\", and called on nations neither to recognise what it deemed \"this illegal authority\" nor to entertain diplomatic or economic relations with it. Both of these measures were adopted by ten votes to none with France abstaining.\n\nRhodesian black nationalists and their overseas supporters, prominently the OAU, clamoured for Britain to remove Smith's government with a military invasion, but Britain dismissed this option because of various logistical issues, the risk of provoking a pre-emptive Rhodesian strike on Zambia, and the psychological problems that were likely to accompany any confrontation between British and Rhodesian troops in what Smith said would be a \"fratricidal war\". Wilson instead resolved to end the Rhodesian rebellion through economic sanctions; these principally comprised the expulsion of Rhodesia from the Sterling area, a ban on the import of Rhodesian sugar, tobacco, chrome and other goods, and an oil boycott of Rhodesia. When the Rhodesians continued to receive oil, Wilson attempted to directly cut off their main supply lines, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at Beira and Lourenço Marques, by posting a Royal Navy squadron to the Mozambique Channel in March 1966. This blockade, the Beira Patrol, was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. The United Nations proceeded to institute the first mandatory trade sanctions in its history with Security Council Resolutions 232 (December 1966) and 253 (April 1968), which required member states to cease all trade and economic links with Rhodesia.\n\nWilson predicted in January 1966 that the various boycotts would force Smith to give in \"within a matter of weeks rather than months\", but the British and UN sanctions had little effect on Rhodesia, largely because South Africa and Portugal went on trading with the breakaway colony, providing it with oil and other key resources. Clandestine \"sanction-busting\" trade with other nations also continued, initially at a reduced level, and the diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand. Rhodesia thus avoided the economic collapse predicted by Wilson and gradually became more self-sufficient. The Rhodesian government set up a string of front holding companies in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein to help keep trade open, with some success; goods that had previously been imported from Britain were replaced by Japanese, French and West German equivalents. Even many OAU states, while bombarding Rhodesia with vitriol, continued importing Rhodesian food and other products. The United States created a formal exception in its embargo with the Byrd Amendment of 1971, under which the US replaced its import of chrome from the Soviet Union with Rhodesian chrome ore. This breach of the UN sanctions, passed by the US Congress on the back of anti-communist Cold War considerations, was warmly welcomed by Southern white supremacists; it aided the Rhodesian economy until 1977, when the newly elected President Jimmy Carter successfully pushed Congress to repeal it.\n\nOfficial diplomatic recognition by other countries was key for Rhodesia as it was the only way it could regain the international legitimacy it had lost through UDI. Recognition by the UK itself through a bilateral settlement would be the \"first prize\", in Smith's words, as it would end sanctions and constitutional ambiguity and make foreign acceptance, at least in the West, far more likely. Considering their country a potentially important player in the Cold War as a \"bastion against communism\" in southern Africa, the RF posited that some Western countries might recognise UDI even without a prior Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement. Specifically, it expected diplomatic recognition from South Africa and Portugal, and thought that France might recognise Rhodesia to annoy Britain and create a precedent for an independent Quebec. But although South Africa and Portugal gave economic, military and limited political support to the post-UDI government (as did France and other nations, to a lesser extent), neither they nor any other country ever recognised Rhodesia as a \"de jure\" independent state. Rhodesia's unsuccessful attempts to win Western support and recognition included offers to the US government in 1966 and 1967, ignored by Lyndon B Johnson's administration, to provide Rhodesian troops to fight alongside the Americans and other anti-communist forces in Vietnam.\n\nBritain withdrew most of its High Commission staff from Salisbury in the days following UDI, leaving a small skeleton staff to man a \"residual mission\" intended to help Gibbs keep the British government informed of local happenings. Several countries followed Britain's lead and closed their consulates in Salisbury, with one prominent exception to this being the United States, which retained its consulate-general in post-UDI Rhodesia, relabelling it a \"US Contacts Office\" to circumvent the problem of diplomatic recognition. South Africa and Portugal maintained \"Accredited Diplomatic Representative\" offices in Salisbury, which were embassies in all but name, while Rhodesia kept its pre-UDI overseas missions in Pretoria, Lisbon and Lourenço Marques. Unofficial representative offices of the Rhodesian government also existed in the US, Japan and West Germany, while a citizen of Belgium was employed to represent Rhodesian interests there. The Rhodesian High Commission in London, located at Rhodesia House on the Strand, remained under the control of the post-UDI government and effectively became its representative office in the UK. Like the South African Embassy on Trafalgar Square, Rhodesia House became a regular target for political demonstrations. These continued even after Britain forced the office to close in 1969.\n\nBecause UDI claimed to make Rhodesia independent under the Queen as an effective dominion, many countries justified their retention of missions in Rhodesia concurrently with their non-recognition of the state by pointing out that the envoys' accreditation was to the Queen and not to Smith's government \"per se\". But Rhodesia moved away from its original line of independence as a constitutional monarchy and towards republicanism during the late 1960s, hoping to end ambiguity regarding its claimed constitutional status and elicit official foreign recognition. In March 1970, after the electorate had voted \"yes\" in a referendum the previous year both to a new constitution and to the abandoning of symbolic ties to the Queen, Smith's government declared Rhodesia a republic. Far from prompting recognition, this led all countries apart from Portugal and South Africa to withdraw their consulates and missions, as the justification of royal accreditation could no longer be used. After Portugal's Carnation Revolution in 1974, the Rhodesian mission in Lisbon was closed in May 1975, with its counterpart in Lourenço Marques following a month later on Mozambican independence. Portugal also withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia, leaving South Africa as the only country with links to Salisbury. Rhodesia's diplomatic activities were thereafter greatly diminished.\n\nThe Rhodesian High Court's nine Appellate and General Division judges initially neither rejected UDI nor openly supported it. The Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle, of the Appellate Division, announced simply that the judges would go on carrying out their duties \"according to the law\". This originally noncommittal stance evolved over time, largely pivoting around legal cases argued at the High Court in Salisbury between 1966 and 1968. The first of these, \"Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke N. O. and Others\", concerned Daniel Madzimbamuto, a black Rhodesian who was detained without trial by the Rhodesian government on 6 November 1965, the day after the declaration of a state of emergency and five days before UDI, on the grounds that he might pose a danger to the public. Desmond Lardner-Burke, the Rhodesian Minister of Justice and Law and Order, prolonged the state of emergency in February 1966, prompting Madzimbamuto's wife to appeal for his release, arguing that since the United Kingdom had declared UDI illegal and outlawed the Rhodesian government with the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965, the state of emergency (and, by extension, Madzimbamuto's imprisonment) had no legal basis.\n\nThe General Division of the Rhodesian High Court ruled on 9 September 1966 that legal sovereignty lay with the British government, but that to \"avoid chaos and a vacuum in the law\" the Rhodesian government should be considered to be in control of law and order to the same extent as before UDI. In February 1968, ruling on Madzimbamuto's appeal, Beadle concluded that the Smith administration would be recognised by the local judiciary as the \"de facto\" government by virtue of its \"effective control over the state's territory\", but that \"de jure\" recognition would be withheld as this was not \"firmly established\". Madzimbamuto applied for the right to appeal to the British Privy Council; the Rhodesian Appellate Division promptly ruled that he had no right to do so, but the Privy Council considered his case anyway.\n\nIn late February 1968, considering the fate of James Dhlamini, Victor Mlambo and Duly Shadreck, three black Rhodesians convicted of murder and terrorist offences before UDI, Beadle ruled that Salisbury retained its pre-UDI powers regarding executions and could carry out death sentences. Whitehall announced on 1 March that at the request of the UK government, the Queen had exercised the royal prerogative of mercy and commuted the three death sentences to life imprisonment. Dhlamini and the others applied for a permanent stay of execution on this basis. At the hearing for Dhlamini and Mlambo on 4 March 1968, Beadle argued that he saw the statement from London as a decision by the UK government and not the Queen herself, and that in any case the 1961 constitution had transferred the prerogative of mercy from Britain to the Rhodesian Executive Council. \"The present government is the fully \"de facto\" government and as such is the only power that can exercise the prerogative\", he concluded. \"It would be strange indeed if the United Kingdom government, exercising no internal power in Rhodesia, were given the right to exercise the prerogative of clemency.\" The Judge President Sir Vincent Quenet and Justice Hector Macdonald agreed, and the application was dismissed. Justice John Fieldsend of the High Court's General Division resigned in protest, writing to Gibbs that he no longer believed the High Court to be defending the rights of Rhodesian citizens. Dhlamini, Mlambo and Shadreck were hanged on 6 March.\n\nOn 23 July 1968, the Privy Council in London ruled in Madzimbamuto's favour, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether the 1961 or 1965 constitution was considered effective. It declared the latter, \"revolutionary\" constitution illegal, and ruled that the former was overridden by the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965, which had effectively outlawed the Rhodesian legislative, administrative and legal authorities in British law. Lord Reid, delivering the majority opinion (Lord Pearce dissented), argued that the \"usurper\" government, though the effective master of Rhodesia, could not be considered lawful as the UK government was still attempting to regain control and it was impossible to say whether or not it would succeed. He ruled that only Whitehall could determine what constituted the maintenance of \"law and order\" in Rhodesia, and that the Rhodesian emergency measures were unlawful as they had been formalised by the Officer Administering the Government, a post-UDI figure who was, in British eyes, unconstitutional. Reid concluded that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as they no longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice J R Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies' ruling on 12 August and four days later was sworn in as Chief Justice of Botswana.\n\nThe Rhodesian High Court granted full \"de jure\" recognition to the post-UDI government on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black Rhodesians who had been a month earlier convicted of terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council \"so far as possible\", the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that the court therefore faced a choice between the 1965 constitution and a legal vacuum, the latter of which he felt he could not endorse. Referring to the Privy Council's decision that the UK might yet remove the post-UDI government, he said that \"on the facts as they exist today, the only prediction which this court can make is that sanctions will not succeed in overthrowing the present government ... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so\".\n\nMacdonald, a member of Beadle's ruling panel, argued that since UDI, the British government had acted unconstitutionally and illegally regarding Rhodesia by involving the United Nations in what should have been legally considered a domestic problem, and had concurrently abdicated its right to the allegiance of the Rhodesian people by waging economic war against the country and encouraging other nations to do the same. To support this argument, Macdonald referred to the assertion by the 17th-century Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius that \"the purpose of governing and the purpose of destroying cannot subsist together\". Since Britain was in a state of economic war against Rhodesia, the court concluded, it could not at the same time be regarded as governing it. UDI, the associated 1965 constitution and the government were thereafter considered \"de jure\" by the Rhodesian legal system.\n\nThe British Commonwealth Secretary, George Thomson, promptly accused the Rhodesian judges of breaching \"the fundamental laws of the land\", while Gibbs announced that since his position as Governor existed under the 1961 constitution, which allowed appeals to the Privy Council, he could only reject the Rhodesian court ruling. The Rhodesian judges continued regardless. Their recognition of the post-UDI order carried over to the 1969 republican constitution, adopted in 1970.\n\nVestiges of British ties were removed piecemeal by the government over the decade following UDI, and replaced with symbols and terminology intended to be more uniquely Rhodesian. A silver \"Liberty Bell\", based on the bell of the same name in Philadelphia, was cast during 1966 and rung by the Prime Minister each year on Independence Day (the anniversary of UDI), the number of chimes signifying the number of years since the declaration of independence. The Union Jack and Rhodesia's Commonwealth-style national flag—a defaced Sky Blue Ensign with the Union Jack in the canton—continued to fly over government buildings, military bases and other official locations until 11 November 1968, the third anniversary of UDI, when they were superseded by a new national flag: a green-white-green vertical triband, charged centrally with the Rhodesian coat of arms. The Union Jack continued to be ceremonially raised at Cecil Square in Salisbury on 12 September each year as part of the Pioneers' Day holiday, which marked the anniversary of the establishment of Salisbury (and, by extension, Rhodesia) in 1890.\n\nSince Elizabeth II was still the Rhodesian head of state in the eyes of Smith's administration until 1970, \"God Save the Queen\" remained the Rhodesian national anthem, and continued to accompany official occasions such as the opening of the Rhodesian parliament. This was intended to demonstrate Rhodesia's continued loyalty to the Queen, but the use of the unmistakably British song at Rhodesian state occasions soon seemed \"fairly ironic\", as \"The Times\" put it. Salisbury started looking for a replacement anthem around the same time as its introduction of the new flag, and in 1974, after four years without an anthem (\"God Save the Queen\" was formally dropped in 1970), republican Rhodesia adopted \"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\", an anthem coupling original lyrics with the tune of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\". The country's head of state under the republican constitution was the President of Rhodesia, the first of whom was Dupont.\n\nState press censorship, which had been introduced on UDI, was lifted in early April 1968. Decimalisation occurred on 17 February 1970, two weeks before Rhodesia's reconstitution as a republic, with the new Rhodesian dollar replacing the pound at a rate of two dollars to each pound. Following the republic's formal declaration the next month, the Rhodesian military removed nomenclatural and symbolic references to the Crown—the Royal Rhodesian Air Force and Royal Rhodesia Regiment dropped their \"Royal\" prefixes, new branch and regimental flags were designed, and the St Edward's Crown surmounting many regimental emblems was expunged in favour of the \"lion and tusk\", a motif from the coat of arms of the British South Africa Company that had been used in Rhodesian military symbolism since the 1890s. The air force's new roundel was a green ring with the lion and tusk on a white centre. Later that year, a system of new Rhodesian honours and decorations was created to replace the old British honours. Rhodesia's police force, the British South Africa Police, was not renamed.\n\nWilson told the British House of Commons in January 1966 that he would not enter any kind of dialogue with the post-UDI Rhodesian \"illegal regime\" until it gave up its claim of independence, but by mid-1966 British and Rhodesian civil servants were holding \"talks about talks\" in London and Salisbury. By November that year, Wilson had agreed to negotiate personally with Smith. The two Prime Ministers unsuccessfully attempted to settle aboard HMS \"Tiger\" in December 1966 and HMS \"Fearless\" in October 1968. After the Conservatives returned to power in Britain in 1970, provisional agreement was reached in November 1971 between the Rhodesian government and a British team headed by Douglas-Home (who was Foreign Secretary under Prime Minister Edward Heath), and in early 1972 a Royal Commission chaired by Lord Pearce travelled to Rhodesia to investigate how acceptable the proposals were to majority opinion. After extensive consultation, the commission reported that while whites, coloureds and Asians were largely in favour of the presented terms, most blacks rejected them. The deal was therefore shelved by the British government.\n\nThe Rhodesian Bush War, a guerrilla conflict pitting the Rhodesian Security Forces against the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), the respective armed wings of ZANU and ZAPU, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. The 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal, which over the next year replaced Portuguese support for Smith with an independent, Marxist–Leninist Mozambique on Rhodesia's eastern frontier, greatly swung the war's momentum in favour of the nationalists (particularly ZANU, which was allied with Mozambique's governing FRELIMO party), and caused the sanctions on Rhodesia to finally begin having a noticeable effect. Diplomatic isolation, the sanctions, guerrilla activities and pressure from South Africa to find a settlement led the Rhodesian government to hold talks with the various black Rhodesian factions. Abortive conferences were held at Victoria Falls (in 1975) and Geneva (1976). Despite ideological and tribal rifts, ZANU and ZAPU nominally united as the \"Patriotic Front\" (PF) in late 1976 in a successful attempt to augment overseas support for the black Rhodesian cause.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, it was apparent that white minority rule could not continue forever. Even Vorster realized that white rule in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1 was not a realistic option. Smith, who was decisively re-elected three times during the 1970s, eventually came to this conclusion as well. He announced his acceptance in principle of one man, one vote during Henry Kissinger's Anglo-American initiative in September 1976, and in March 1978 concluded the Internal Settlement with non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau. This settlement, boycotted by the PF and rejected internationally, led to multiracial elections and Rhodesia's reconstitution under majority rule as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979. Muzorewa, the electoral victor, took office as the country's first black Prime Minister at the head of a coalition Cabinet comprising 12 blacks and five whites, including Smith as minister without portfolio. Dismissing Muzorewa as a \"neocolonial puppet\", ZANLA and ZIPRA continued their armed struggle until December 1979, when Whitehall, Salisbury and the Patriotic Front settled at Lancaster House. Muzorewa's government revoked UDI, thereby ending the country's claim to be independent after 14 years, and dissolved itself. The UK suspended the constitution and vested full executive and legislative powers in a new Governor, Lord Soames, who oversaw a ceasefire and fresh elections during February and March 1980. These were won by ZANU, whose leader Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister when the UK granted independence to Zimbabwe as a republic within the Commonwealth in April 1980.\n\nFootnotes\nReferences\nSpeeches\n\nNewspaper and journal articles\nOnline sources\nBibliography\n"}

In addition to Brooks, it features cameos from Brooks regulars Dom DeLuise, Dick Van Patten, and Rudy De Luca.\n\nRobin of Locksley is captured during the Crusades and is imprisoned at Khalil Prison in Jerusalem. With the help of fellow inmate Asneeze, who was arrested for jaywalking, he escapes and frees the other inmates. Robin is asked by Asneeze to find his son, Ahchoo. Upon returning to England, he finds Ahchoo and discovers that Prince John has assumed control while King Richard is away fighting in the Crusades. Unbeknownst to Richard, the prince is abusing his power. Robin returns to his family home, Loxley Hall, only to find it being repossessed by John's men. His family's blind servant, Blinkin, informs Robin that his family members and pets have all died as well, and the only thing his father left him is a key which opens \"the greatest treasure in all the land.\"\n\nRobin recruits the large and ignorant Little John, and his friend Will Scarlet O'Hara, to help regain his father's land and oust Prince John from the throne. On his quest, Robin also attracts the attention of Maid Marian of Bagelle, who wants to find the man who has the key to her heart and Everlast chastity belt. They are also joined by Rabbi Tuckman, who shares with them his sacramental wine and bargain circumcisions. While Robin is training his band of tights-clad Merry Men, the spoonerism-spouting Sheriff of Rottingham, hires the Mafioso Don Giovanni to assassinate Robin at the Spring Festival. Maid Marian hears of the evil plot, and sneaks out of her castle to warn Robin, accompanied by her frumpy German Lady-in-Waiting Broomhilde. The Sheriff and Don expect that Robin will not refuse a chance to participate in the archery tournament due to his pride, and Robin does just that.\n\nAt the archery tournament, a disguised Robin makes it to the final round, where he makes his shot but loses to his opponent. Robin calls this situation absurd, takes off his disguise and pulls out a copy of the movie's script to discover that he gets another shot; the Sheriff and Prince John then pull out their own copies and confirm this. Giovanni's assassin attempts to kill Robin by shooting at him with a scoped crossbow, but Blinkin catches the arrow in midair. Robin then takes the second shot, this time using a special \"PATRIOT arrow\" and hits the target. After winning the tournament, Robin is arrested. Before Robin is taken away, Marian promises to do the most disgusting thing she can think of in exchange for Robin's safety: marry the Sheriff.\n\nSeveral hours later, the ceremony commences with the opening prayer in Pig Latin. The Abbot quickly and discreetly reveals the Sheriff's unimposing first name, Mervyn. Before Marian can say \"I do\", the castle is attacked by the Men in Tights, led by Little John, Ahchoo, Blinkin, and Will. They quickly free Robin and a battle ensues. Marian is carried off to the tower by the Sheriff, who wants to deflower her but cannot get around the chastity belt without some uncomfortable chafing.\n\nRobin arrives and begins to duel the sheriff, during which Robin's key falls into the lock of Marian's chastity belt, and Robin realizes it really is the key to \"the greatest treasure in all the land.\" After winning the fight Robin spares the sheriff's life only to miss his sheath and accidentally run the sheriff through. The witch Latrine, Prince John's full-time cook and part-time adviser, saves him by giving him a magical lifesaver in exchange for agreeing to marry her. Before Robin and Marian can \"celebrate\" in her bedroom, Broomhilde arrives, insisting they get married first. Rabbi Tuckman conducts the ceremony, but they are suddenly interrupted by King Richard, recently returned from the Crusades, who insists on sanctioning the marriage with a kiss to the new bride. He orders John to be taken away to the Tower of London and made part of the tour. He also announces that, as the Prince has surrounded his given name with a foul stench, all the toilets in the kingdom are to be renamed \"johns\".\n\nAll being as it should be, Robin and Marian are married and Ahchoo is made the new sheriff of Rottingham. When the crowd expresses its disbelief at a black sheriff, Ahchoo reminds them that \"it worked in \"Blazing Saddles\"\". When the night comes, Robin and Maid Marian attempt to open the chastity belt, only to realize her lock will not open with his key.\n\nCritics gave mixed reviews to the film, with many noting that the film lacked as many humorous scenes as Brooks's earlier works. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 50%, based on 21 reviews, and an average rating of 5.3/10. Despite this, the film has developed a cult following.\n\n\"Robin Hood: Men in Tights\" was not one of Brooks's best grossing films in its theatrical release, though Brooks mentions that it and \"Spaceballs\" are his two top selling films on video in a DVD interview for the latter film.\n\nThe film debuted at #6 at the North American box office, with only $6,841,830. The film went on to gross a domestic total of $35,739,755.\n\n"}

The first subject heading assigned by WorldCat is \"Toy and movable books\". Little, Brown published a U.S. edition in the same year.\n\n\"The Jolly Postman\" has sold more than six million copies, Allan Ahlberg told \"The Guardian\" in 2006. It made innovative use of envelopes to include letters, cards, games and a tiny book.\n\nAlternatively, The Jolly Postman is a series of three books including 1991 and 1995 sequels to \"The Jolly Postman, or Other people's letters\". In the U.K., the first book won the Children's Book Award and the Kurt Maschler Award. The second book won the 1991 Greenaway Medal for British children's book illustration.\n\n\"The Jolly Postman\" follows an unnamed mail carrier as he delivers letters by bicycle to characters from traditional children's stories that are well known in Britain. Following each sheet of narrative verse and illustration, there is one shaped like an envelope and containing one of the postman's deliveries. Each envelope is opened and its enclosure read at that point in the story.\n\nWorldCat gives the entire description: \"A Jolly Postman delivers letters to several famous fairy-tale characters such as the Big Bad Wolf, Cinderella, and the Three Bears. Twelve of the pages have been made into six envelopes and contain eight letters and cards. Each letter may be removed from its envelope page and read separately.\"\n\nThe Ahlbergs won two major British book awards for \"The Jolly Postman\", the 1986 Kurt Maschler Award and 1987 Children's Book Award.\nFrom 1982 to 1999 the \"Emil\" figurines from Maschler publishers and Booktrust annually recognised the creator(s) of one \"work of imagination for children, in which text and illustration are integrated so that each enhances and balances the other\". The Federation of Children's Book Groups award (now named for the bookseller Red House) \"celebrate[s] the books that children themselves love reading\". The winner is determined by vote of British children.\n\nJanet Ahlberg was a commended runner up for the 1986 Greenaway Medal and she won the 1991 Greenaway for the sequel. The annual award by the Library Association then recognised the year's best children's book illustration by a British subject.\n\nFollowing \"The Jolly Postman\"'s success, the Ahlbergs and Heinemann produced two sequels. The latter, third in the series, was published after Janet's death in 1994. For the second book, \"The Jolly Christmas Postman\", she won her second Kate Greenaway Medal.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "166136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166136", "title": "Vehicle identification number", "text": "Vehicle identification number\n\nA vehicle identification number (VIN) is a unique code, including a serial number, used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles, towed vehicles, motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, as defined in ISO 3779 (content and structure) and ISO 4030 (location and attachment).\n\nVINs were first used in 1954 in the United States. From 1954 to 1981, there was no accepted standard for these numbers, so different manufacturers used different formats.\n\nIn 1981, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the United States standardized the format. It required all on-road vehicles sold to contain a 17-character VIN, which does not include the letters I (i), O (o), and Q (q) (to avoid confusion with numerals 1 and 0).\n\nThere are vehicle history services in several countries that help potential car owners use VINs to find vehicles that are defective or have been written off. See the Used car article for a list of countries where this service is available.\n\nThere are at least four competing standards used to calculate the VIN.\n\nModern VINs are based on two related standards, originally issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1979 and 1980: ISO 3779 and ISO 3780, respectively. Compatible but different implementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the European Union and the United States, respectively.\n\nThe VIN comprises the following sections:\n\nThe first three characters uniquely identify the manufacturer of the vehicle using the world manufacturer identifier or WMI code. A manufacturer who builds fewer than 1000 vehicles per year uses a 9 as the third digit, and the 12th, 13th and 14th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification. Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category (e.g., bus or truck), a division within a manufacturer, or both. For example, within 1G (assigned to General Motors in the United States), 1G1 represents Chevrolet passenger cars; 1G2, Pontiac passenger cars; and 1GC, Chevrolet trucks.\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in the U.S. assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers.\n\nThe first character of the WMI is the region in which the manufacturer is located. In practice, each is assigned to a country of manufacture, although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region (Example: Opel/Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of \"W0L\" because Adam Opel AG is based in Rüsselsheim, Germany).\n\nIn the notation below, assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number. For example, 8X–82 denotes the range 8X, 8Y, 8Z, 81, 82, excluding 80.\nThe fourth to ninth positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS. This is used, according to local regulations, to identify the vehicle type, and may include information on the automobile platform used, the model, and the body style. Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field. Most manufacturers since the 1980s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle. Example: for the 2007 Chevrolet Corvette, U is for a 6.0-liter V8 engine, and E is for a 7.0 L V8.\n\nOne element that is fairly consistent is the use of position nine as a check digit, compulsory for vehicles in North America and China, and used fairly consistently elsewhere.\n\nThe 10th to 17th positions are used as the 'vehicle identifier section' (VIS). This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question. This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices, but often is a simple sequential number. In North America, the last five digits must be numeric.\n\nOne consistent element of the VIS is the 10th digit, which is required worldwide to encode the model year of the vehicle. Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself (I, O and Q), the letters U and Z and the digit 0 are not used for the model year code. The year code is the model year for the vehicle.\n\nThe year 1980 was encoded by some manufacturers, especially General Motors and Chrysler, as \"A\" (since the 17-digit VIN was not mandatory until 1981, and the \"A\" or zero was in the manufacturer's pre-1981 placement in the VIN), yet Ford and AMC still used a zero for 1980. Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters, so that \"Y\" represents the year 2000. 2001 to 2009 are encoded as the digits 1 to 9, and subsequent years are encoded as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", etc.\n\nOn April 30, 2008, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted a final rule amending 49 CFR Part 565, \"so that the current 17 character vehicle identification number (VIN) system, which has been in place for almost 30 years, can continue in use for at least another 30 years\", in the process making several changes to the VIN requirements applicable to all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States. There are three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems:\n\nCompulsory in North America and China is the use of the 11th character to identify the factory at which the vehicle was built. Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes.\n\nIn the United States and China, the 12th to 17th digits are the vehicle's serial or production number. This is unique to each vehicle, and every manufacturer uses its own sequence.\n\nCheck-digit validation is compulsory for all road vehicles sold in North America.\n\nWhen trying to validate a VIN with a check digit, first either (a) remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or (b) use a weight of zero (see below) to cancel it out. The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value. If the calculated value is 0–9, the check digit must match the calculated value. If the calculated value is 10, the check digit must be X. If the two values do not match (and there was no error in the calculation), then there is a mistake in the VIN. However, a match does not prove the VIN is correct, because there is still a 1/11 chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit: for example, the valid VINs 5GZCZ43D13S812715 (correct with leading five) and SGZCZ43D13S812715 (incorrect with leading character \"S\"). The VINs in the Porsche image, WP0ZZZ99ZTS392124, and the GM-T body image, KLATF08Y1VB363636, do not pass the North American check-digit verification.\n\nTransliteration consists of removing all of the letters, and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts. These numerical alternatives (based on IBM's EBCDIC) are in the following chart. \"I\", \"O\", and \"Q\" are not allowed in a valid VIN; for this chart, they have been filled in with \"N/A\" (\"not applicable\"). Numerical digits use their own values.\n\n\"S\" is 2, and not 1. There is no left-alignment linearity.\n\nThe following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN. The 9th position is that of the check digit. It has been substituted with a 0, which will cancel it out in the multiplication step.\n\nConsider the hypothetical VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788, where the underscore will be the check digit.\n\n\nWith a check digit of \"X\", the VIN 1M8GDM9A_KP042788 is written 1M8GDM9A\"X\"KP042788.\n\nA VIN with \"straight-ones\" (seventeen consecutive \"1\"s) has the nice feature that its check digit \"1\" matches the calculated value \"1\". This is because a value of one multiplied by 89 (sum of weights) is 89, and 89 divided by 11 is 8 with remainder ; thus 1 is the check digit. This is a way to test a VIN-check algorithm.\n\n\nVINs may be optically read with barcode scanners or digital cameras, or digitally read via OBD-II in newer vehicles. There are smartphone applications that can pass the VIN to websites to decode the VIN.\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) assigns the WMI (world manufacturer identifier) to countries and manufacturers. The following list shows a small selection of world manufacturer codes.\n\n\n"}

The text was copied in seal script on sheets of silk around 215 BCE, under the Qin dynasty, but might have dated from even earlier. Modern editors chose its title because the text starts with a list of fifty-two ailments for which recipes are given. The formulary presents more than 250 exorcistic and drug-based cures for ailments such as warts, hemorrhoids, inguinal swellings, and snake bites. Among other medical treatments, the text also recommends lancing and cauterization, but mention neither acupuncture nor moxibustion (cauterization with moxa).\n\nWith roughly 9,950 characters, \"Wushi'er bingfang\" is the longest of the medical texts that have been found in ancient Chinese tombs. Along with other excavated manuscripts (from Zhangjiashan and Wuwei, among others), it has shed light on the early development of Chinese medicine. It illustrates, for instance, that magical incantations were a common therapeutic method among the social elite of the time. And because it shows the development of channel theory in a primitive stage and does not mention the doctrine of Yinyang and the Five Phases, it has pushed historians to date the more sophisticated \"Huangdi Neijing\" (\"Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon\") to the first century BCE.\n\nThe original manuscript of \"Wushi'er bingfang\" is kept at the Hunan Provincial Museum in Changsha.\n\n\n"}
