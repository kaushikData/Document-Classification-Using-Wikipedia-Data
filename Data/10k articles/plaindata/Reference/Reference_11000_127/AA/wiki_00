{"id": "12631014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12631014", "title": "Al Costello", "text": "Al Costello\n\nGiacomo Costa (14 December 1919 – 22 January 2000) was an Italian Australian professional wrestler best known by his ring name, Al Costello. Costello was the first professional wrestler to be nicknamed \"The Man of a Thousand Holds\" because of his innovative and very technical style.\n\nCostello was the creator and original member of the tag team The Fabulous Kangaroos, whose \"Ultra Australian\" gimmick complete with boomerangs, bush hats and the song \"Waltzing Matilda\" as their entrance music, existed in various forms from 1957 until 1983. Costello was either an active wrestler, or a manager in all versions of The Fabulous Kangaroos. He and Roy Heffernan are arguably the most famous version of The Kangaroos, regarded as one of the top tag teams to ever compete in professional wrestling, and are often credited with popularizing tag team wrestling in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\nCostello later formed other versions of The Fabulous Kangaroos with Ray St. Clair, Don Kent and Tony Charles. He also managed the team of Don Kent & Bruno Bekkar and later on \"Johnny Heffernan\" under The Fabulous Kangaroos name.\n\nCostello officially retired from wrestling in 1983 but still made a few brief returns to the ring after that. In 1993, he managed The New Fabulous Kangaroos (Denny Kass and Al Snow) before retiring completely from the wrestling business. Both Costello and his tag team partner Heffernan died before Kangaroos were honored as the first tag team to ever be inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003, which started a tradition of inducting a new team every year.\n\nCosta was born in Lingua di Salina, Italy, near Sicily, and lived there until his family immigrated to Australia when he was six years old. The family settled in Rockdale, New South Wales, where Costa helped out in his father’s fruit store. He excelled at school sports, and became interested in weightlifting at an early age. At age 16, Costa took up amateur boxing despite his father’s wishes that he should become an opera singer. Costa was approached by Australian middleweight wrestling champion \"Basher Bonas\", who convinced him to try wrestling. Costa made his debut under an assumed name; his father still had hopes of him becoming an opera singer, and he did not want his parents to find out that he was wrestling. He came up with the name \"Al Costello\", thinking it sounded tough like a portmanteau of Al Capone and Frank Costello.\n\nAl Costello made his professional wrestling debut in 1938, but the man that would be known as \"The Man of a Thousand Holds\" 20 years later, found little success early in his career. The general belief in Australian professional wrestling at the time was that a wrestler had to go to North America and learn how to be a pro before the bookers would even consider pushing them up the card. Costello travelled across Asia, where he did see some success; he won the Malaysian Heavyweight title in 1939, as well as the South Africa trophy in 1949. During the 1950s, Costello finally started to turn heads at home by winning the Australasian title. In 1952, Costello began wrestling in America, hoping to finally break through and make a big name of himself.\n\nFor years, Al Costello had been working on an idea for a new tag team; he even knew who he wanted for a partner: a wrestler he had worked with some years ago named Roy Heffernan. Because Costello and Heffernan had lost touch over the years, the idea remained dormant until Costello toured Hawaii in 1956. Costello mentioned his idea of an \"Ultra Australian\" tag team to fellow wrestler, and future promoter, Joe Blanchard. Blanchard happened to be a good friend of Roy Heffernan and knew he was working in Stampede Wrestling at the time. Blanchard put the two in touch with each other, and Costello was soon off to Calgary, Alberta, Canada to join Heffernan and finally make his tag team a reality. Costello and Heffernan debuted as \"The Fabulous Kangaroos\" on 3 May 1957 for Stu Hart’s Stampede Wrestling promotion in a match against Maurice LaPointe and Tony Baillargeon. Only weeks after that first match, The Kangaroos were working with the top tag teams in the promotion.\n\nAfter working in Stampede for a while, The Fabulous Kangaroos started to travel across the United States, headlining shows wherever they went due to their ability to rile up crowds with their heel (bad guy) tactics. On one occasion in August 1958, The Kangaroos, or \"Kangaroo Men\" as they were billed, nearly caused a riot in Madison Square Garden during a match against Antonino Rocca and Miguel Pérez; the fans began to throw fruit and stones at them. After the match ended without a decisive winner, the promoters stepped in, turned up the arena lights, and played the National Anthem to stop a potential riot. This was a common tactic used at the time by the New York promoters in order to prevent riots and help the heels leave the arena unharmed. Later that year, Costello and Heffernan started working for Dory Funk’s NWA Western States promotion based in Amarillo, Texas. Here, The Kangaroos won their first title as a team when they defeated Pepper Gomez and El Medico to win the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship on 17 November 1958. Their first title reign was short lived, however, as Gomez and Rito Romero defeated them to regain the titles two weeks later.\n\nBetween 1957 and 1965, The Kangaroos wrestled in the United States, Canada, Asia and select tours of Australia and New Zealand. They worked for such companies as Capitol Wrestling Corporation (the future World Wrestling Entertainment), Championship Wrestling from Florida, NWA Ohio, the Japan Wrestling Association and the World Wrestling Association in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe Kangaroos never forgot their roots and continued to work in Canada off and on through the years; in addition to Stampede Wrestling, the team also worked for NWA All-Star Wrestling based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Costello featured in a National Film Board of Canada short subject \"La Lotta\"/\"Wrestling\"/\"Le Catch\". Their stint in NWA All-Star Wrestling was the last time Costello and Heffernan teamed together. In June 1965, The Kangaroos lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy and then split up. Heffernan had left Australia to tour the world in 1953 and wanted to return to his homeland, while Costello was determined to remain in the United States for a while longer.\n\nHeffernan returned to Australia and began working for World Championship Wrestling (the Australian version, not the North American wrestling federation) under booker Jim Barnett as a singles wrestler. Costello was originally supposed to return to Australia as well and work for WCW, but those plans never came through. Instead, Costello remained in the United States and kept working in the tag team division, never seeking a career as a singles wrestler. Costello began wrestling for Georgia Championship Wrestling, where he teamed up with Louis Tillet to form a tag team known as \"The Globetrotters\"; a name that played off Costello’s Australian and Tillet’s French heritage. The Globetrotters defeated the Mysterious Medics in the finals of the Georgia NWA World Tag Team Championship but only held the titles for a week before losing them to Kurt and Karl Von Brauner on 4 February 1966. After this, the Globetrotters broke up due to differences in their approach to tag teaming.\n\nCostello then moved to the NWA Mid-America territory near Nashville, Tennessee. In Mid-American, Costello teamed with Herb Welch to win the Mid-American version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, which they held for just over 2 months. While still working in Mid-America, Costello began to team with Karl Von Brauner, who used a \"German Nazi\" gimmick despite being American. Under the management of \"Playboy\" Gary Hart, Costello and Von Brauner were billed as \"The Internationals\"; the team was later managed by George \"Crybaby\" Cannon. The Internationals worked mainly in Tennessee and Texas for NWA Western States. In Texas, Costello and Von Brauner won the Texas version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, a title Costello and Heffernan had held in 1958. The team was also billed as the first NWA American Tag Team Champions, titles that were also recognized by World Class Championship Wrestling in addition to the Western States promotion. The Internationals lost the American Tag Team title to Fritz and Waldo Von Erich on 21 February 1967. Kurt then decided to go back to teaming with his storyline brother, Karl Von Brauner.\n\nAfter the Internationals broke up, Costello returned to Australia to visit friends and relatives and to recuperate after many years on the road. On his way back to the United States, Costello had a stop over in Detroit, Michigan, where he met Cleo Williams. The two fell in love and married shortly afterwards, remaining together for the rest of Costello’s life.\n\nIn 1967, Al Costello reformed The Fabulous Kangaroos, this time teaming up with Ray St. Clair. The team had been touring non-stop for about six months when St. Clair was forced to retire due to knee problems. A few months after St. Clair retired, Costello found a new man to don the bush hat: Don Kent. Kent, who was from Michigan, adopted the Ultra-Australian gimmick (but retained his American accent) and the two formed the third overall and second most well-known version of The Fabulous Kangaroos. Costello and Kent teamed together on a regular basis from 1968 until 1974, approximately the same amount of time that Costello spent teaming with his original partner, Roy Heffernan. Costello and Kent continued in a tradition that was reminiscent of the original Kangaroos; when a federation needed a new tag team title, The Kangaroos were brought in and acknowledged as champions upon arrival instead of holding a tournament to determine the champions. In 1967, the Japanese federation \"International Wrestling Enterprise\" (IWE) brought The Kangaroos in as the first Trans-World Wrestling Alliance World Tag Team Champions. They held this title until 10 January 1968 when IWE mainstays Toyonobori and Thunder Sugiyama beat them for the gold. Over the years, many more title reigns came from various promotions all over the globe. In Canada, The Kangaroos were the first Eastern Sports Association International Tag Team Champions. In the World Wrestling Association of Indianapolis, they held the WWA World Tag Team Championship twice. In addition to winning titles all over North America, Costello and Kent also made appearances for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE).\n\nThe Kangaroos frequented NWA Detroit, where they held the Detroit version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship for most of 1971. By the end of 1972, The Kangaroos began working for Nick Gulas’ NWA Mid-America. In Mid-America, they held the local version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship, the Mid-America version, on three occasions.\n\nAfter a match at Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire extinguisher off the wall and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging it so much that he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15 days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.\n\nIn 1975, Costello surprised everyone by returning to professional wrestling as the manager of the team known as \"The Love Brothers\" (Hartford and Reggie Love). He actually stepped into the ring on occasion as part of special six-man tag team matches.\n\nAfter recovering from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The fact that he was able to recover from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, as well as the remarkable shape he was in for a man of his age.\n\nCostello reformed The Fabulous Kangaroos once more, this time teaming up with wrestler Tony Charles. The team defeated Dominic DeNucci and Chris Markoff to win Detroit's version of the NWA World Tag Team title, the same title that Costello and Kent had previously held. The Kangaroos title run was short, however, and they lost their gold to \"Crazy\" Luke Graham and Ripper Collins.\n\nIn 1977, Tony Charles was replaced by Don Kent and the two reunited for a tour of Puerto Rico with the World Wrestling Council (WWC). In Puerto Rico, The Kangaroos arrived billed as the WWC World Tag Team Champions, once more to give a newly created title legitimacy. They dropped the titles to Carlos Colón and Jose Rivera on 12 March 1977 and remained in the WWC until 1978 chasing, but never regaining, the WWC World Tag Team Championship. After their tour in Puerto Rico ended, Don Kent returned to singles wrestling, and Costello refocused on managing.\n\nIn 1981, Costello convinced Kent to once again don the bush hat and pick up the boomerang. Costello got Kent to team up with Bruno Bekkar, who was mostly known from working in his native New Zealand and Australia. Kent and Bekkar worked a tour for the WWC, while Costello served as their manager. The team won the WWC North American Tag Team titles from Jack and Jerry Brisco on 22 October 1981. They then lost the titles to Invader I and Super Gladiator but quickly gained them back before dropping the titles for good to Invader and Gladiator on 26 January 1982. The Kent and Bekkar team only lasted through one tour of the Caribbean, after which Bruno Bekkar returned to Australia and New Zealand to work for the local promotions there.\n\nBekkar was replaced with Johnny Heffernan (Canadian wrestler Bob Della Serra), a storyline cousin of Roy Heffernan, for what was the final version of The Fabulous Kangaroos. The team ended Terry and Dory Funk, Jr.'s year and a half run with the WWC World Tag Team championship on 1 May 1982. Kent and Heffernan held the gold for less than two months before losing the WWC World Tag Team titles to Invader I and Pierre Martel. After a tour in Puerto Rico, Costello, Kent and Heffernan returned to work for Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF), a promotion The Kangaroos last worked for in 1962. In Florida, The Kangaroos won the NWA Florida Global Tag Team Championship four times. The final storyline involving The Fabulous Kangaroos saw Al Costello bring in J.J. Dillon to act as his short term replacement while he was \"away on business\". When Costello returned from his business trip, Dillon kayfabe refused to give up The Kangaroos' contracts and was backed up by both Kent and Heffernan. This angle was designed to write Al Costello out of The Fabulous Kangaroos' storyline and allow him to retire from wrestling altogether. Not long after Costello retired, Kent and Johnny Heffernan went their separate ways.\n\nAfter retiring from wrestling, Al Costello became the head of security at College Harbor, Florida. In 1992, at the age of 71, Costello retired from his job in Florida and began teaching wrestling. He also started to manage The New Fabulous Kangaroos in 1993, a team consisting of Mickey Doyle and Denny Kass who worked for \"Motor City Wrestling\" (MCW). By the fall of 1993, Mickey Doyle had been replaced by a young wrestler by the name of Al Snow; with Costello’s help The New Fabulous Kangaroos defeated \"Canadian Lighting\" (Otis Apollo and \"Irish\" Bobby Clancy), on 29 December 1993, to win the MCW Tag Team Championship. On 14 May 1994, Kass and Snow defeated Canadian Lighting again to win the Border City Wrestling (BCW) Can-Am Tag Team Championship, unifying the two tag team championships. A week later, The New Fabulous Kangaroos lost both sets of titles to Scott D'Amore and \"Irish\" Bobby Clancy. After losing the unified MCW/BCW Tag Team championships, The New Kangaroos split up; Snow focused on his World Wrestling Federation career while Costello retired for good, never making another wrestling related appearance.\n\nOn 22 January 2000, Costello died from a combination of pneumonia and heart problems. In 2003, Al Costello and Roy Heffernan became the first tag team to ever be inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. Since that time, the Hall of Fame has honored other tag teams, but The Fabulous Kangaroos were given the honor of being the first. In the tradition of the Kangaroos, they were \"billed as champions on arrival\" one last time.\n\n\n"}

(The latter title, still in print and regularly revised, is the one that machinists today are usually referring to when they speak imprecisely of \"the machinist's handbook\" or \"the machinists' handbook\".)\n\nThe somewhat generic sound of the title \"American Machinists' Handbook\", and the ambiguity of its apostrophe usage, no doubt contributed to the confounding of the two books' titles and identities. It capitalized on readers' familiarity with \"American Machinist\", McGraw-Hill's popular trade journal. But the usage could have benefited from some branding discipline, because the confusion over whether the title was properly \"American Machinist's Handbook\" or \"American Machinists' Handbook\" or \"\"American Machinist\" 's Handbook\" was (and is) considerable. (\"\"American Machinist\" 's Handbook\" would be parallel to the construction of the title \"\"Machinery's\" Handbook\"; perhaps McGraw-Hill's handbook's title was originally conceived as that and later was muddied into \"American Machinists' Handbook\".)\n\nAlthough McGraw-Hill's \"American Machinists' Handbook\" appeared first (1908), it is doubtful that Industrial Press's \"Machinery's Handbook\" (1914) was a mere me-too conceived afterwards in response. The eager market for such a reference work had probably been obvious for at least a decade before either work was compiled, and presumably the appearance of the McGraw-Hill title merely prodded Industrial Press to finally get moving on a handbook of its own.\n\n\"American Machinists' Handbook\", coedited by Fred H. Colvin and Frank A. Stanley, went through eight editions between 1908 and 1945. In 1955, McGraw-Hill published \"The new American machinist's handbook. Based upon earlier editions of American machinists' handbook\" (sic; note the apostrophe usage difference within that title), but presumably the book did not compete well enough with \"Machinery's Handbook\", because no subsequent editions were produced. Meanwhile, \"Machinery's Handbook\" has continued to be regularly revised and updated, right up to today, and it is still a \"bible of the metalworking industries.\"\n\nRenewal data from Rutgers. All works after 1923 with renewed copyright are presumably still protected.\n"}

{"id": "6409646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6409646", "title": "Austronesian alignment", "text": "Austronesian alignment\n\nAustronesian alignment, commonly known as the Philippine-type voice system, is a typologically unusual kind of morphosyntactic alignment in which \"one argument can be marked as having a special relationship to the verb\". This special relationship manifests itself as a voice affix on the verb that corresponds to a noun (i.e., the subject) within the same clause that is either marked for a particular case or found in a privileged structural position within the clause or both.\n\nAustronesian alignment is best known from the languages of the Philippines, but is also found in Taiwan's Formosan languages, as well as in Borneo, Northern Sulawesi, and Madagascar, and has been reconstructed for the ancestral Proto-Austronesian language. \n\nThe examples below are in Proto-Austronesian. Asterisks indicate a reconstruction. The voice affix on the verb appears in red text, while the subject, which the affix selects, appears in underlined bold italics. Four voices have been reconstructed for Proto-Austronesian: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Locative Trigger\" and \"Instrument Trigger\".\n\nWhereas most languages have two voices which are used to track referents in discourse, a transitive 'active' voice and an intransitive 'passive' or 'antipassive' voice, prototypical Philippine languages have two voices, which are both transitive. One of the two Philippine voices is similar, in form, to the active voice of ergative–absolutive languages, and the other is similar to the active voice of nominative–accusative languages. They perform functions similar to the active and passive/antipassive voices, respectively, in those languages.\n\nThe ergative-like Philippine voice used to be often called the \"passive,\" and the accusative-like voice has often been called the \"active.\" However, that terminology is misleading and now deprecated, partly because the \"passive\" is the default voice in Austronesian languages, and a true passive is a secondary voice; however, no substitute terms have been widely accepted. Among the more common terms proposed are \"patient trigger\" (the ergative-like voice) and \"agent trigger\" (the accusative-like voice), which will be used here. The phrases are taken from the terms 'agent' and 'patient', which are used in semantics for the acting and acted-upon participants in a transitive clause.\n\nThe three types of voice system and the grammatical cases of their core arguments can be contrasted as follows:\n\nThe Philippine cases are only approximately equivalent to their namesakes in other languages and so are placed in quotes. (\"Direct,\" as used here, is commonly called \"nominative\" or \"absolutive\", for example.) The \"ergative\" case is identical in form to the Philippine genitive case, but it is common in ergative languages for the ergative case to have the form of an oblique case like the genitive or the locative case.\n\nThe reconstructed Proto-Malayo-Polynesian examples below illustrate the Philippine system. (Asterisks indicate a reconstruction.) The unmarked clause order was to have the verb first and the \"direct\" phrase last. The voice was indicated by an affix to the verb (infix \"-um-\" for agent trigger and suffix \"-ən\" for patient trigger). In modern Philippine languages, the practical effect of the voice distinction is rather like the difference between sentences with definite patients and sentences with indefinite patients (i.e., the use of \"a\" and \"the\" with direct objects) in English, and it is assumed to have played a similar role in the protolanguage.\n\nIn the example in (1) below, the agent \"a manuk\" \"the chicken\" is in sentence-final, subject position. The verb appears with the \"-um-\" agent trigger infix. In (2), however, the patient \"a wai\" \"the mango\" is in subject position, and the verb is marked with the \"-ən\" patient trigger suffix. Note that, in (1), the patient \"ta wai\" translates to \"a mango\".\n\nPhilippine-type languages have more than two voices. Beside the ones shown above, there would be also locative and benefactive voices. The locative trigger is illustrated below in (3); the \"-an\" suffix on the verb selects \"a kahiw\" \"the tree\", which is the location of the action, as the subject:\n\nThe various Austronesian languages sampled below demonstrate that the number of voices differs from language to language. While the majority sampled have four voices, it is possible to have as few as three voices, and as many as six voices. In the examples below, the voice affix on the verb appears in red text, while the subject, which the affix selects, appears in underlined bold italics.\n\nThe data below come from Formosan primarily spoken in Taiwan.\n\nHla’alua has three voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\" and \"Circumstantial Trigger\".\n\nThe circumstantial trigger suffix selects for locative and theme subjects.\n\nWhile bound pronouns have a direct case form, nouns do not bear a special direct case marker for subjects in Hla’alua. \n\nKavalan has three voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\" and \"Circumstantial Trigger\".\n\nThe circumstantial trigger prefix selects for instrument and benefactee subjects.\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks the subject in Kavalan, is \"ya\".\n\nPaiwan has four voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Locative Trigger\", and \"Instrument Trigger\".\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks the subject in Paiwan, is \"a\".\n\nPazeh, which became extinct in 2010, had four voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Locative Trigger\", and \"Instrument Trigger\".\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks the subject in Pazeh, is \"ki\".\n\nPuyuma has four voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Locative Trigger\", and \"Circumstantial Trigger\".\n\nThe circumstantial trigger suffix selects for benefactee and instrument subjects.\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks the subject in Puyuma, is \"na\" or \"i\".\n\nThe two dialects of Seediq presented below each have a different number of voices. The direct case morpheme, which marks the subject in both dialects, is \"ka\".\n\nThe Tgdaya dialect has four voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Locative Trigger\" and \"Instrument Trigger\".\n\nThe Truku dialect has three voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Goal Trigger\", and \"Circumstantial Trigger\".\n\nThe goal trigger suffix selects for patient and location subjects. The circumstantial trigger prefix selects for benefactee and instrument subjects.\n\nSquliq Atayal has four voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Locative Trigger\", and \"Circumstantial Trigger\".\n\nThe circumstantial trigger prefix selects for benefactee and instrument subjects.\n\nThe direct case morpheme in Squliq Atayal is \"qu’\".\n\nTsou has four voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Locative Trigger\", and \"Benefactive Trigger\". In addition to the voice morphology on the main verb, auxiliary verbs in Tsou, which are obligatory in the sentence, are also marked for voice. However, auxiliaries only differentiate between \"agent trigger\" and \"non-agent trigger\" (in pink text).\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks subjects in Tsou, is \"’o\".\n\nThe data below come from Philippine languages, a subgroup under Malayo-Polynesian, predominantly spoken across the Philippines, with some found on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.\n\nBlaan has three voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Goal Trigger\", and \"Instrument Trigger\".\n\nThe goal trigger voice selects for patient and location subjects.\n\nCebuano has four voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Circumstantial Trigger\", and \"Instrument Trigger\".\n\nThe circumstantial trigger suffix selects for location, benefactee and goal subjects.\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks the subject in Cebuano, is \"ang\" or \"si\".\n\nKalagan has four voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Instrument Trigger\", and \"Circumstantial Trigger\".\n\nThe circumstantial trigger suffix selects for benefactee and location subjects.\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks the subject in Kalagan, is \"ya\". The direct case form of the first person, singular pronoun is \"aku\", whereas the ergative case form is \"ku\".\n\nKapampangan has five voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Goal Trigger\", \"Locative Trigger\", and \"Cirumstantial Trigger\".\n\nThe circumstantial trigger prefix selects for instrument and benefactee subjects.\n\nThe direct case morpheme in Kapampangan is \"ing\", which marks singular subjects, and \"reng\", which is for plural subjects. Non-subject agents are marked with ergative case, \"ning\", while non-subject patients are marked with accusative case, \"-ng\", which is cliticized onto the preceding word.\n\nLimos Kalinga has five voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Location Trigger\", \"Benefactive Trigger\" and \"Instrument Trigger\".\n\nExcept for when the subject is the agent, the subject is found directly after the agent in the clause.\n\nMaranao has four voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Circumstantial Trigger\", and \"Instrument Trigger\".\n\nThe circumstantial suffix selects for benefactee and location subjects.\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks the subject in Maranao, is \"so\".\n\nTagalog has six voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Locative Trigger\", \"Benefactive Trigger\", \"Instrument Trigger\", and \"Reason Trigger\".\n\nThe locative trigger suffix selects for location and goal subjects. (In the examples below, the goal subject and the benefactee subject are the same noun phrase.)\n\nThe reason trigger prefix can only be affixed to certain roots, the majority of which are for emotion verbs (e.g., \"galit\" \"be angry\", \"sindak\" \"be shocked\"). However, verb roots such as \"matay\" \"die\", \"sakit\" \"get sick\", and \"iyak\" \"cry\" may also be marked with the reason trigger prefix.\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks subjects in Tagalog, is \"ang\". The indirect case morpheme, \"ng\" /naŋ/, which is the conflation of the ergative and accusative cases seen in Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, marks non-subject agents and non-subject patients.\n\nTondano has four voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Locative Trigger\", and \"Circumstantial Trigger\".\n\nThe circumstantial trigger selects for instrument and benefactee subjects.\n\nThe subject is found in sentence-initial position, before the verb.\n\nThe data below come from Bornean languages, a geographic grouping under Malayo-Polynesian, mainly spoken on the island of Borneo, spanning administrative areas of Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nKadazan Dusun has three voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\" and \"Benefactive Trigger\".\n\nThe direct case morpheme, which marks the subject in Kadazan Dusun, is \"i\".\n\nKelabit has three voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\" and \"Instrument Trigger\".\n\nUnlike other languages presented here, Kelabit does not use case-marking or word-ordering strategies to indicate the subject of the clause. However, certain syntactic processes, such as relativization, target the subject. Relativizing non-subjects results in ungrammatical sentences.. \n\nKimaragang has five voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", \"Benefactive Trigger\", \"Instrument Trigger\" and \"Locative Trigger\".\n\nOnly intransitive verbs can be marked with the locative trigger suffix, which looks similar to the patient trigger suffix.\n\nThe direct case marker, which marks the subject in Kimaragang, is \"it\" for definite nouns and \"ot\" for indefinite nouns.\n\nThe data below represent the Barito languages, and are from a language spoken on Madagascar, off the east coast of Africa. Other languages from Barito are spoken in Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nMalagasy has three voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", and \"Circumstantial Trigger\".\n\nThe circumstantial trigger suffix selects for instrument and benefactee subjects.\n\nMalagasy does not have a direct case marker. However, the subject is found in sentence-final position.\n\nAlignment types resembling Austronesian aligment have been observed in non-Austronesian languages.\n\nVan Urk (2015) suggests that Dinka Bor, which is a Nilotic language spoken in South Sudan, exhibits Austronesian alignment. This language has three voices: \"Agent Trigger\", \"Patient Trigger\", and \"Circumstantial Trigger\".\n\nThe subject is found in sentence-initial position, before the verb.

It was heard in the Appellate Division, by Corbett JA, Kotzé JA, Hefer JA, Galgut AJA and Cillié AJA, on 7 November 1985, with judgment handed down on 29 November.\n\nThe court determined that the granting of an order of specific performance is entirely a matter of the discretion of the court. Apart from the rule that such discretion is to be exercised judicially upon all the relevant facts, no rules should be prescribed to regulate that discretion, as such rules would inevitably curtail the court's discretion and negate or erode the plaintiff's right to select his remedy.\n\nThe English rules regulating courts' discretion to order specific performance are predicated upon that remedy's availability by way of equitable relief only; they are inappropriate to South African law. The Appellate Division held, therefore, that the indiscrimate following of English cases in this regard is to be decried.\n\nThe decision of the Cape Provincial Division, in \"SA Mutual Life Assurance Society v Benson\" (granting an order of specific performance in an action for delivery of shares freely obtainable on the Stock Exchange) was by this reasoning confirmed.\n\n\n\n"}

The camp was also used to detain civil populations several times between 1939 and 2007. Its darkest period was in 1942, when 2,251 Jews, including 110 children, were transferred from Rivesaltes via the Drancy internment camp to the Nazi extermination camp Auschwitz, where they were murdered.\n\nIn 1935, the commune of Rivesaltes, situated on a rail route 40 km from the Spanish border, was considered a strategic position for the French army, which took over 612 hectares between Rivesaltes and Salses, 5 km from the city of Rivesaltes, to construct a camp. It was originally intended to be used as a military base. At the same time, southern France became a major haven for Jewish refugees attempting to flee to neutral countries, whether legally or illegally.\n\nThe military camp was built in 1938, a few miles from Perpignan. Four-fifths of the camp was situated within the commune of Rivesaltes and one-fifth within the commune of Salses. The camp was named \"Camp Joffre\" after General Joseph Joffre, the commander-in-chief of the French army during World War I.\n\nFollowing the Retirada (the exodus of about half a million refugees from Spain to France in early 1939 during the Spanish Civil War), the French government decided to use Camp Joffre to intern more than 15,000 Catalan refugees. This decision was never fully put into action, although a small influx of Catalan refugees was held there in 1939.\n\nOn December 10, 1940, the Ministry of Defense set aside south of the camp to house people expelled from Germany. The military camp was then run in parallel with the civilian camps.\n\nIn 1939, at the start of World War II, the camp became a military transit base, and in 1940 a refuge for Spanish refugees fleeing from Francoist Spain. After the signing of the armistice, France was split into two. The \"zone libre\" (\"free zone\"), in which the Pyrénées-Orientales was included, came under the administration of the Vichy government.\n\nGradually, the Joffre camp became a place of internment for families of gypsies, Jews and Spanish refugees. With a capacity of 8000, before long the camp became overcrowded, families were separated, and conditions deteriorated greatly.\n\nWhen the first internees arrived on January 14, 1941, the status of the camp was not yet settled. It was decided to make it an \"accommodation center\" for families. Initially planned for a maximum of 17,000 \"guests\", it included 150 large barracks with a capacity of 10,000 individuals. Families were divided between barracks: there were barracks for men, others for women and children. By May 31, 1941, the camp had 6,475 internees from 16 nationalities; Spaniards constituted more than half of them, and Jewish refugees from other countries more than a third.\n\nAt five o'clock in the morning on August 26, 1942, the foreign Jews in the southern zone were rounded up and taken to the \"Centre national de rassemblement des Israélites\" at Rivesaltes. This \"center\" was newly established in the camp, in blocks J (for women and children), F (for men; this block had previously been reserved for workers) and K (reception, screening and sorting). It was planned as a transit camp for a total of 10,000 internees who would be housed there for 15 days before being deported. The 1,176 Jews already in the camp prior to the round-up were included in this count.\n\nConvoys left Rivesaltes for Drancy internment camp on August 11 (400 people), August 23 (175 people), September 1 (173 people), September 4 (621 people), September 14 (594 people), September 21 (72 people), September 28 (70 people), October (101 people) and October 20 (107 people).\n\nSerge Klarsfeld called the Rivesaltes camp \"the Drancy of the free zone\", noting that from September 4 to October 22 it played the same role as the Drancy camp in the occupied zone: a transit camp for deportees whose ultimate destination was the Nazi extermination camps. Rivesaltes was, during that time, the camp where the Jews arrested in the so-called \"free zone\" were gathered, and from which many of them (about 1,700) were sent to Drancy itself.\n\nIn November 1942, as Germany invaded the previously unoccupied southern zone of France, German troops moved into Camp Joffre, and it was closed as an internment camp on November 25. There were 277 staff members when it closed.\n\nDuring those two years, the camp of Rivesaltes housed about 21,000 internees; about 5,714 of them were interned in the \"special camp\" or transit camp, of whom 2,313 were sent to Drancy and 2,251 were excluded from deportation by the screening committee. A further 215 internees died in the camp, including 51 children one year old or younger.\n\nThe German army left Rivesaltes on August 19, 1944. While the military part of Rivesaltes camp resumed its original purpose, a new \"guarded residence center\" was established there on September 12, 1944. Located chiefly in block Q, this center housed people interned under the Vichy regime's \"épuration\" (\"purification\") policy. It had a maximum capacity of 1,080 internees.\n\nThe center continued to receive people from other European countries: Spaniards interned for crossing the border illegally were put to work to secure the center, and in January and March 1945 several hundreds of Soviet prisoners of war arrived.\n\nThe closing of the center was decided upon on December 10, 1945, and completed early in October 1946.\n\nThe military authority transformed the camp into Depot No. 162 for prisoners of war. Housing mostly German and Italian soldiers, this camp held less than 10,000 prisoners in October 1944, and between 6,000 and 7,000 men in May 1945. It closed on May 1, 1948. The prisoners worked extensively on the reconstruction of the Roussillon region. Between May 1945 and 1946, 412 German prisoners of war died in the camp.\n\nThis facility continued to be used after the events of the Second World War. The Algerian war was the next opportunity to use the facility to detain people.\n\nUnder the stiffening of the French state caused by the Algerian War, the French government planned in 1957 to create an internment camp on the site. The Prefect tried to dissuade them because, in addition to a training center populated mainly by North Africans, the site contained a Professional Military Training Center particularly for North Africans and young soldiers mobilized for war. The plan was not carried out in its entirety, but a prison was set up discreetly for people convicted of being supporters of Algerian independence, and 527 prisoners were held there between March 9 and April 18, 1962.\n\n\"Harkis\" is the generic term for Muslim Algerians serving as auxiliaries with the French Army during the Algerian War (1954–1962).\n\nIn June 1962, the 1st regiment of Algerian riflemen was repatriated to Camp Joffre. They brought with them hundreds of civilians, women and children running away from the new independent Algeria. In October 1962, about 8000 Harkis were staying at the transit and rehabilitation camp of Rivesaltes (including those from the camp of Larzac and Bourg-Lastic). In all, according to the calculations of Abderahmen Moumen, about 20,000 people passed through and accumulated in the camp from 1962 to 1964. The stay varied from a few days for some families to years for others.\n\nFamilies considered \"irretrievable\"—a term used by administrators at the time—were sent at the end of 1964 to the Saint-Maurice-l'Ardoise military camp in the Gard until 1975. Several hundred more families who had employment but no housing were accommodated in a \"civil village\" in the Rivesaltes camp during the 1960s. In 1963, a forestry village was also created in Rivesaltes for about 25 families of former auxiliaries (about a hundred people). The next decade saw the bulk of this population moved to the HLM (rent-controlled housing) of Rearte, built in the city of Rivesaltes to finalize the situation of these families. The last residents left the camp in February 1977.\n\nOther French Colonial Forces and auxiliaries from Africa and French Indochina came, accompanied by civilians, with the decolonization of the French colonial empire: from 1964 to 1966 about 600 Guineans arrived, and other former soldiers and their families came from French Indochina.\n\nCreated in 1986, the administrative detention center was set up to detain Spanish nationals who had entered French territory illegally. With more than a thousand arrested on French soil in 1994, it was one of the largest detention centers in France. It was closed in 2007.\n\nFrench Name: \"Mémorial du Camp de Rivesaltes\"\n\nThe memorial museum project has its origins in Serge Klarsfeld's 1978 publication of the list of deported Jews and Jews who died in the camp of Rivesaltes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In terms of content, Tschudi is particularly interested in representing the long-established independence of the Swiss population. Furthermore, Tschudi makes mention of the struggle between empire and papacy, the crusades, and a large number of other issues concerning Swiss cities, dioceses and monasteries.\n\nFurthermore, Tschudi’s \"Chronicon Helveticum\" contains much valuable material for the study of the William Tell legend.\n\nIt is probably due to these circumstances that Tschudi’s \"Chronicon Helveticum\" became a model for later writers dealing with William Tell. Not only did Tschudi’s chronicle become the major source for Johannes von Müller’s \"History of the Swiss Confederation\" (German: \"Geschichten Schweizerischer Eidgenossenschaft\"), it also served as a model for Friedrich Schiller’s play \"William Tell\".\n\n"}

It highlights major features that the manager of a forum might want and should expect to be commonly available in different forum software. These comparisons do not include remotely hosted services which use their own proprietary software, rather than offering a package for download which webmasters can host by themselves.\n\nBasic general information about the forums: creator/company, license/price etc.\n\n\nMost forums provide an option for the forum owner to customize the look and feel. Some forums also allow the administrator to create multiple styles or themes, and allow the user to choose which one they wish to view. Themes may simply be a different set of colors and graphics, or they may involve a different layout to the forum, such as one optimized for small-screen devices.\n\nThe comparison table shows whether a forum software allows forum administrators to customise the \"template\" of the forum (or specific sections thereof) without altering the released code. Support is considered partial where it's only possible to add CSS rules in this way.\n\nUnread message tracking refers to the way that is used by forum software to track and display messages that have not yet been read by the current user. This can be one of the following:\n\nThis column judges the ability to allow users to export data from the forum installation and then import it in new installations of the same software (cf. right to fork) or feed it to data conversion tools.\n\nSoftware portability is a key assessment criterion for the choice and procurement of software.\n\nWhether the software can be used with standard Email or NNTP clients. Adoption of standard protocols is key for interoperability.\n\nWhether the internationalization and localization of the software are sufficient to both allow and actually provide grammatically correct support for the native language of the target users.\n\nFor the purposes of this table, we consider languages used by an amount of installations/users equal to at least 1% of the top million web properties using that software, without major reported bugs in support.\n\nSingle sign-on is often required to enhance web accessibility of the application. This can be accomplished with standards like OAuth and OpenID.\n\nAutomatic recommendation systems based on content and users can help forum users find existing discussions similar to those they're browsing or on the topic they're searching, or else reach the correct users with their posts, avoiding to \"spam\" the forum with duplicate or off-topic posts.\n\nMany users do not bother to search a forum and directly create new threads to seek an answer to a question. On some forums, when the user types a new thread subject, the forum software brings up similar threads automatically on the side. This helps keep the number of redundant threads (or the overall forum pollution) to a lower level as users who neglect to search for a topic and are posting a thread may find the answer to their question as they are creating the new thread.\n\nMost forums are at risk of continuous attack by forum spammers, largely promoting websites with no relevance to the forum's niche. Systems vary in how they are geared to defense, and checking the offering is an important consideration before selection. A forum cannot succeed unless there is an effective system of defense, and an efficient set of tools for spam removal.\n\nCAPTCHAs are a common feature used among most internet forum software and are often used to prevent automated registrations.\n\nBanning or deleting membership should come as standard, with the ability to blacklist the username, email address or IP address for variable time spans.\n\nReference to an anti-forum spam database can be built into the forum software, or offered as add-ons for specific databases.\n\nHuman-friendly forum URLs do not have a query string and instead contain only the path of the topic. A user-unfriendly URL may contain cryptic parameters, numeric IDs, or file type extensions (e.g. .php) that do not matter to the user and could change if the forum is reimplemented using a different programming language. User-friendly URLs are easy to remember and to type, and may enhance search engine optimization (SEO).\n\nIn general this is accomplished via URL mapping, however, historically in many forum software packages, human-friendly URLs are an afterthought implemented via URL rewriting, and URLs often contain a numeric ID which represents the thread, while the remainder of the URL can in reality be any string: <nowiki>http://example.com/forum/12345/lets-use-friendly-urls</nowiki> and <nowiki>http://example.com/forum/12345/bogus-path-actually</nowiki> point to the same thread, <nowiki>http://example.com/forum/12345/</nowiki>.\n\nThe only non-controversial counter-argument to using user-friendly URLs is that they would be leaked in the HTTP referer header field when a user clicks on an external link from a post, which is undesirable for private (sub)forums, since a URL derived from the topic title could convey sensitive information. This issue can be resolved by rewriting external links to point to a redirection page that performs referer hiding.\n\nInformation about what data storage system can be used.\n"}

{"id": "7515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7515", "title": "Cutter Expansive Classification", "text": "Cutter Expansive Classification\n\nThe Cutter Expansive Classification system is a library classification system devised by Charles Ammi Cutter. The system was the basis for the top categories of the Library of Congress Classification.\n\nCharles Ammi Cutter (1837–1903), inspired by the decimal classification of his contemporary Melvil Dewey, and with Dewey's initial encouragement, developed his own classification scheme for the Winchester Town Library and then the Boston Athenaeum, at which he served as librarian for twenty-four years. He began work on it around the year 1880, publishing an overview of the new system in 1882. The same classification would later be used, but with a different notation, also devised by Cutter, at the Cary Library in Lexington, Massachusetts.\n\nMany libraries found this system too detailed and complex for their needs, and Cutter received many requests from librarians at small libraries who wanted the classification adapted for their collections. He devised the Expansive Classification in response, to meet the needs of growing libraries, and to address some of the complaints of his critics. Cutter completed and published an introduction and schedules for the first six classifications of his new system (\"Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications\"), but his work on the seventh was interrupted by his death in 1903.\n\nThe Cutter Expansive Classification, although adopted by comparatively few libraries, mostly in New England, has been called one of the most logical and scholarly of American classifications. Library historian Leo E. LaMontagne writes:\n\nCutter produced the best classification of the nineteenth century. While his system was less \"scientific\" than that of J. P. Lesley, its other key features – notation, specificity, and versatility – make it deserving of the praise it has received.\n\nIts top level divisions served as a basis for the Library of Congress classification, which also took over some of its features. It did not catch on as did Dewey's system because Cutter died before it was completely finished, making no provision for the kind of development necessary as the bounds of knowledge expanded and scholarly emphases changed throughout the twentieth century.\n\nThe Expansive Classification uses seven separate schedules, each designed to be used by libraries of different sizes. After the first, each schedule was an expansion of the previous one, and Cutter provided instructions for how a library might change from one expansion to another as it grows.\n\nThe first classification is meant for only the very small libraries. The first classification has only seven top level classes, and only eight classes in all.\n\n\nFurther expansions add more top level classes and subdivisions. Many subclasses arranged systematically, with common divisions, such as those by geography and language, following a consistent system throughout.\n\nBy the fifth classification all the letters of the alphabet are in use for top level classes. These are:\n\n\nThese schedules were not meant to be fixed, but were to be adapted to meet the needs of each library. For example, books on the English language may be put in X, and books on language in general in a subclass of X, or this can be reversed. The first option is less logical, but results in shorter marks for most English language libraries.\n\nMost call numbers in the Expansive Classification follow conventions offering clues to the book's subject. The first line represents the subject, the second the author (and perhaps title), the third and fourth dates of editions, indications of translations, and critical works on particular books or authors. All numbers in the Expansive Classification are (or should be) shelved as if in decimal order.\n\nSize of volumes is indicated by points (.), pluses (+), or slashes (/ or //).\n\nFor some subjects a numerical geographical subdivision follows the classification letters on the first line. The number 83 stands for the United States—hence, F83 is U.S. history, G83 U.S. travel, JU83 U.S. politics, WP83 U.S. painting. Geographical numbers are often further expanded decimally to represent more specific areas, sometimes followed by a capital letter indicating a particular city.\n\nThe second line usually represents the author's name by a capital letter plus one or more numbers arranged decimally. This may be followed by the first letter or letters of the title in lower-case, and/or sometimes the letters a, b, c indicating other printings of the same title. When appropriate, the second line may begin with a 'form' number—e.g., 1 stands for history and criticism of a subject, 2 for a bibliography, 5 for a dictionary, 6 for an atlas or maps, 7 for a periodical, 8 for a society or university publication, 9 for a collection of works by different authors.\n\nOn the third line a capital Y indicates a work about the author or book represented by the first two lines, and a capital E (for English—other letters are used for other languages) indicates a translation into English. If both criticism and translation apply to a single title, the number expands into four lines.\n\nOne of the features adopted by other systems, including Library of Congress, is the Cutter number. It is an alphanumeric device to code text so that it can be arranged in alphabetical order using the fewest characters. It contains one or two initial letters and Arabic numbers, treated as a decimal. To construct a Cutter number, a cataloguer consults a Cutter table as required by the classification rules. Although Cutter numbers are mostly used for coding the names of authors, the system can be used for titles, subjects, geographic areas, and more.\n\nInitial letters Qa–Qt are assigned Q2–Q29, while entries beginning with numerals have a Cutter number A12–A19, therefore sorting before the first A entry.\n\nSo to make the three digit Cutter number for \"Cutter\", you would start with \"C\", then looking under \"other consonants\", find that \"u\" gives the number 8, and under \"additional letters\", \"t\" is 8, giving a Cutter number of \"C88\".\n\n\n"}

The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price.\n\nThe term is derived from \"squatting\", which is the act of occupying an abandoned or unoccupied space or building that the squatter does not own, rent, or otherwise have permission to use.\n\nSome countries have specific laws against cybersquatting beyond the normal rules of trademark law. The United States, for example, has the U.S. Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) of 1999. This expansion of the Lanham (Trademark) Act (15 U.S.C.) is intended to provide protection against cybersquatting for individuals as well as owners of distinctive trademarked names. However, even notable personalities, including rock star Bruce Springsteen and actor Kevin Spacey, failed to obtain control of their names on the internet.\n\nJurisdiction is an issue, as shown in the case involving Kevin Spacey, in which Judge Gary A. Feess, of the United States District Court of the Central District of California, ruled that the actor would have to file a complaint in a Canadian court, where the current owner of kevinspacey.com resided. Spacey later won the domain through the Forum (alternative dispute resolution) f.k.a National Arbitration Forum.\n\nSince 1999, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has provided an arbitration system wherein a trademark holder can attempt to claim a squatted site. In 2006, there were 1823 complaints filed with WIPO, which was a 25% increase over the 2005 rate. In 2007 it was stated that 84% of claims made since 1999 were decided in the complaining party's favor.\n\n\n\nWith the rising of social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter, a new form of cybersquatting involves registering trademark-protected brands or names of public figure\non popular social media websites.\n\nOn June 5, 2009, Tony La Russa, the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, filed a complaint against Twitter, accusing Twitter of cybersquatting. The dispute centered on a Twitter profile that used La Russa's name, had a picture of La Russa, and had a headline that said \"Hey there! Tony La Russa is now using Twitter.\" The profile encouraged users to \"join today to start receiving Tony La Russa's updates.\" According to La Russa, the status updates were vulgar and derogatory. La Russa argued that the author of the profile intended, in bad faith, to divert Internet traffic away from La Russa's website and make a profit from the injury to La Russa's mark. On June 26, 2009, La Russa filed a notice of voluntary dismissal after the parties settled the case.\n\nSocial networking websites have attempted to curb cybersquatting, making cybersquatting a violation of their terms of service.\n\nTwitter's name squatting policy forbids the cybersquatting as seen in many domain name disputes, like \"username for sale\" accounts: \"Attempts to sell or extort other forms of payment in exchange for usernames will result in account suspension.\" Additionally, Twitter has an \"Impersonation Policy\" that forbids non-parody impersonation. An account may be guilty of impersonation if it confuses or misleads others; \"accounts with the clear intent to confuse or mislead may be permanently suspended.\" Twitter's standard for defining parody is whether a reasonable person would be aware that the fake profile is a joke. Lastly, soon after the La Russa suit was filed, Twitter took another step to prevent \"identity confusion\" caused by squatting by unveiling \"Verified Accounts\". Usernames stamped with the \"verified account\" insignia indicate that the accounts are real and authentic.\n\nFacebook reserves the right to reclaim usernames on the website if they infringe on a trademark. Trademark owners are responsible for reporting any trademark infringement on a username infringement form Facebook provides. Furthermore, Facebook usernames require \"mobile phone authentication\". In order to obtain a username, the individual needs to verify the account by phone.\n\n"}

{"id": "221383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221383", "title": "Jean-Georges Noverre", "text": "Jean-Georges Noverre\n\nJean-Georges Noverre (29 April 1727 19 October 1810) was a French dancer and balletmaster, and is generally considered the creator of \"ballet d'action\", a precursor of the narrative ballets of the 19th century. His birthday is now observed as International Dance Day.\n\nHis first professional appearances occurred as a youth in Paris at the Opéra-Comique, at Fontainebleau, in Berlin before Frederick II and his brother Prince Henry of Prussia, in Dresden and Strasburg. In 1747 he moved to Strasbourg, where he remained until 1750 before moving to Lyon. In 1751, he composed his first great work, \"Les Fêtes Chinoises\" for Marseilles. The work was revived in Paris in 1754 to great acclaim. In 1755, he was invited by Garrick to London, where he remained for two years.\n\nBetween 1758 and 1760 he produced several ballets at Lyon, and published his \"\". It is from this period that the revolution in the art of the ballet for which Noverre was responsible can be dated. Prior to Noverre, ballets were large spectacles that focused mainly on elaborate costumes and scenery and not on the physical and emotional expression of the dancers. He was next engaged by Duke Karl Eugen of Württemberg, and later Austrian Empress Maria Theresa, until 1774. In 1776, he was appointed \"maître des ballets\" of the Paris Opera at the request of Queen Marie Antoinette. He returned to Vienna in Spring of 1776 to stage ballets there, but in June 1776 he returned again to Paris. He regained this post until the French Revolution reduced him to poverty. He died on 19 October 1810 at Saint-Germain-en-Laye.\nNoverre's friends included Voltaire, Mozart, Frederick the Great and David Garrick (who called him \"the Shakespeare of the dance\"). The ballets of which he was most proud were his \"La Toilette de Vénus\", \"Les Jalousies du sérail\", \"L'Amour corsaire\" and \"Le Jaloux sans rival\". Besides the \"Lettres sur la danse\", Noverre wrote \"Observations sur la construction d'une nouvelle salle de l'Opéra\" (1781); \"Lettres sur Garrick écrites à Voltaire\" (1801); and \"Lettre à un artiste sur les fêtes publiques\" (1801).\n\nNoverre was born in Paris on 29 April 1727 to Marie Anne de la Grange and Jean Louys, a Swiss soldier. The couple expected their son to pursue a military career but the boy chose dance, studying with M. Marcel and then with the famous Louis Dupré. Noverre's first professional experience probably occurred at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 8 June 1743 in \"Le Coq du village\". In his middle and late teenage years, Noverre performed at Fontainebleau, and in Berlin before Frederick II and his brother Prince Henry of Prussia. Appearances in Dresden and Strasbourg followed before his return to the Opéra-Comique. In 1747, Noverre became ballet master in Strasbourg and created his first great success, the exotic \"Les Fêtes chinoises\". In 1748 in Strasbourg he married the actress Marie-Louise Sauveur. In 1750, he became principal dancer in Lyon and created his first \"ballet-pantomime\", \"Le Jugement de Pâris\" in 1751. Noverre traveled to Vienna, where he worked under Queen Maria Theresa and became Maître de danse for her twelve-year-old daughter, Marie-Antoinette. Noverre and Marie Antoinette's relationship grew and they became very close. Marie-Antoinette became a patron to Noverre. In early 1754 Noverre produced a frightening and moving scene that disturbed the conservative queen, and he lost his job. He moved to Strasbourg for one year in 1754, and returned to the Opéra-Comique, where \"Les Fêtes\" was staged with great success on 1 July 1754.\n\nIn 1755, he went to London with his wife, his sister and brother, and his company. There, he worked with David Garrick of the Drury Lane Theatre, learning new concepts of theatre and the then-developing natural style of performance. When the London production of \"Les Fêtes chinoises\" was completely destroyed by rioters on the eve of the Seven Years' War, Noverre and his family were forced to go into hiding. He continued to supervise dance spectacles at Drury Lane, but without billing. In 1774 King Louis XV died and Noverre's dear friend Marie-Antoinette became the Queen of France. Marie-Antoinette did not forget about her dear Dance Master, and appointed Noverre to the Paris Opera. This was Noverre's shining moment, but the loyalty and backing of Marie-Antoinette could switch. In 1779 Noverre was unseated from his position because Dauberval, Maximilien Gardel and Mlle Guimard gathered prominent people and poisoned them against Noverre. However, Noverre didn't leave the Opera until 1781. Noverre's fitting effect on the Paris ballet world would be preserved by the production of his tragic ballet \"Jason et Médée\" in 1763. In 1787, Pierre Gardel inherited the throne and Paris Opera, and carried out Noverre's ideas on costume and thoughts on ballet pantomime. (Chazin-Bennhaum) He composed \"Les Caprices de Galathée\", for example, and garbed his dancers in tiger skins and shoes made of tree bark. His naturalist attitude towards costume placed him in the front rank of the French Enlightenment.\n\nNoverre's treatise on dancing and theater expressed his aesthetic theories on the production of ballets and his method of teaching ballet. Noverre wrote this text in London in 1756 and published it in 1760 in Lyon, France. He began his research for his essays in Drury Lane, London, where he choreographed for his own troupe of dancers at the Theatre Royal under the direction of David Garrick. It was in David Garrick's library that Noverre read modern French literature and ancient Latin treatises on pantomime. Noverre was inspired by the pantomimes that he thought stirred up the audience's emotions by the use of expressive movement. He proclaimed in his text that ballet should unfold through dramatic movement, and the movement should express the relationship between the characters. Noverre named this type of ballet, ballet d’action or pantomime ballet (International Dictionary of Ballet 1032). From 1757 to 1760, he produced thirteen new works with composer François Granier at the Lyon Opera. His lighter, colorful pantomime ballets like \"Les Caprices de Galathée\", \"La Toilette de Vénus\", and \"Les Jalousies du sérail\", received great success.\n\nNoverre was most immediately influenced by Jean-Philippe Rameau, David Garrick, and Marie Sallé. Rameau was a very influential French composer and music theorist, and Noverre was inspired by his dance music that combined programmatic and strongly individual elements. David Garrick was an actor and theatre director at the Theatre Royal. Noverre was inspired by his talent for \"histrionics\" and vivid mime work where Noverre wanted to shake from the traditional forms of Ballet. (The Encyclopedia of Dance and Ballet 695).\n\nWith the content that follows it is imperative to closer examine the profound influence of Marie Sallé on Jean-George Noverre. Sallé and Noverre had an intertwining history that began at the Paris Opera Ballet. Sallé had studied in Paris with Françoise Prévost, who was a known predecessor of dramatizing ballet with her virtuosic acting and expressive performance. * Salle had studied in Paris with Francoise Prevost who was an established predecessor of the dramatic style of ballet demonstrated through her virtuosic acting and expressive performances. Sallé made her debut at the Paris Opera in 1727 where she established a reputation for her “delicate grace and expressive mime” abilities.\n\nSallé's London season of 1733-34 at Covent Garden saw her two pantomimes—Pygmalion and Bacchus and Ariadne—which were both staged in the spring of 1734. Additionally, she collaborated with the naturalised British composer George Frideric Handel during his 1734-35 London Opera season during which her pantomimes became a forerunner of Noverre's ballet d'action--. When she returned to Paris in 1735, she choreographed and danced in scenes for Jean-Philippe Rameau's Opera-ballets. Although she retired from the public stage in 1741, she continued to influence the dance community through her coaching and choreographic innovations at Opéra-Comique in 1743, which happens to be when Noverre made his debut.\n\nSocial and economic factors, in what was unequivocally a “man’s world” allowed Noverre to bring forth his ideologies surrounding the evolution of dance. By contrast, the recognition given to Sallé was largely limited to her significance as a performer. Her role as a creative choreographer, and progressive innovator was not only ignored during her lifetime, but it has failed to have been recognized by historians of the dance arts even to this day. Blanked for her virtuosic movements and expressive talents, Sallé laid the foundations for which Noverre was able to move forward. Her choreographic work in Pygmalion brought forth a combination of expressive gestures and dance movements to mediate it's narrative. Although historians have grappled with the duality of Sallé's role in dance history, it is precisely these aspects that deem her the true inventor of the ballet d'action that was to sweep the late eighteenth-century stage under Noverre's creative efforts and leadership.\n\nIn addition to her performance and choreographic work, Sallé worked to create reforms within the rigid ballet world predating Noverre. Sallé revolutionized ballet by her combination of artistic dance movement, the expressive use of gestures matched to the music, and her redesign of costumes and stage scenery in unique ways that broke new ground in the dance world. The simple act of omitting the Mask and the reworking of costumes was later picked up by Noverre in his Les Lettres sur la danse et sur les ballets. Sallé's shifting public image, influenced the reception of her costume reforms. She was performing at the time when the dancers’ costumes were not realistic. Noverre's notion of costume reform clearly stemmed from his association with her. Although he is recognized for his rejection of the dancer's mask, it is most probable that his action would have been motivated by Sallé's “noble, expressive and spiritual countenance,” which inspired particular comment in his Letter.\n\nWhen contemplating the speed of Noverre's rapid shifts in style, one has to consider all the work Sallé created before him. Given her background and gender—with all its discriminatory limitations—Sallé's achievements were nothing short of incredible. Given the continuing battle for gender equality in the contemporary world of both business and the business of the arts world, her accomplishments are even more extraordinary recognizing that they were done in the 18th century, a time when men held all the most important positions of influence and power in the theatrical world, as well as the political world. Going against the grain of a woman's role being limited to interpret the dance creations of men, Sallé broke barriers to stage and perform her own creations. One cannot recognize the work of Noverre's innovations without including the paradigm shifts that grew out of her life and work.\n\nNoverre's text demanded an end to repressive traditions peculiar to the Paris Opera Ballet, such as stereotypical and cumbersome costumes, and old-fashioned musical styles and choreography. Noverre also discussed the methods for training dancers such as encouraging a student to capitalize on his or her own talents (The Encyclopedia of Dance and Ballet 699). Most of Noverre's criticisms of dance in his book were directed towards the Paris Opera Ballet because he felt the Paris Opera Ballet created ballets that were an isolated event within Opera lacking meaningful connection with the main theme of the Opera. He criticized the Paris Opera Ballet use of the mask because it restricted the dancer from showing facial expressions that could bear meaning on their characters. Noverre devoted the whole of his Ninth Letter to the subject of masks and wrote, \" Destroy the masks and\" he argued, \"we shall gain a soul, and be the best dancers in the world.\"\nNoverre specifically dealt with seven major points in his treatise:\n\nNoverre's \"Les Lettres sur la danse et sur les ballets\" had lasting impact on ballet ideology as his text has been printed in almost every European language and his name is one of the most frequently quoted in the literature of dance (Lynham 13). Many of his theories have been implemented in dance classes today and remain a part today's ideology of dance. For example, his idea that a teacher should encourage students to profit from his or her own talents rather than to imitate a teacher or the style of a popular dancer is a present ideology of dance. Noverre did receive criticism from many of his prominent ballet contemporaries, however his theories have survived longer than any of his ballets, which have not been reproduced for at least two centuries (Lynham 127).\n\n\"Lettres sur la danse\" was first published in English in 1782, where it was titled \"The Works of Monsieur Noverre translated from the French\". The translator, Parkyns MacMahon, also translated Noverre's ballet \"Adela of Ponthieu\", and was in touch with him while working on \"The Works of Monsieur Noverre\". In 2014, MacMahon's translation was transcribed with commentary by Michael Burden and Jennifer Thorp, and published with eight essays by dance historians and musicologists as \"The Works of Monsieur Noverre Translated from the French: Noverre, His Circle, and the English\" Lettres sur la Danse (Hillsdale, New York: Pendragon, 2014). Although snippets appear in \"Letters on Dancing and Ballets\" (London: Beaumont, 1930), by Cyril Beaumont, the Burden and Thorp transcription is the only complete English translation.\n\nThe essays in the volume, which cover a number of aspects of Noverre's life and career in depth are as follows: Jennifer Thorp: From \"Les fêtes chinoises\" to \"Agamemnon revenged\": Ange Goudar as commentator on the ballets of Jean-Georges Noverre; Samantha Owens: \"Just as great as Noverre\": the ballet composer Florian Johann Deller (1729–73) and music at the Württemberg court; Kathleen Kuzmick Hansell: Noverre in Milan: a turning point; Adeline Mueller: A peep into Mozart and Le Picq's Serraglio (Milan, 1772): Noverre's tragic reworking of a comic ballet; Edward Nye: Outrageous dancing and respectable Noverre; Bruce Alan Brown: \"Weiß und Rosenfarb\": the end of Noverrian ballet in Vienna and the beginnings of the Wienerischer Musenalmanach; Michael Burden: Regular meetings: Noverre and Gallini in London, 1756-1795; Anna Karin Ståhle: Jean-Georges Noverre applying for jobs.\n\nTo mark the bicentenary of the death of Jean-Georges Noverre, two academic meetings were held which explored aspects of biography, dance, and performance.\n\nThe first was ‘Celebrating Jean-Georges Noverre 1727-1810: his world, and beyond’, which was the 11th Annual Oxford Dance Symposium on 16–17 April 2010 at New College, Oxford. Some of the papers were included in Burden and Thorp (2014).\n\nThe second was the ‘Colloque International à l’occasion du bicentenaire de la mort de Noverre’, les jeudi 21, vendredi 22 et samedi 23 octobre 2010, A l’initiative de L’Association pour un Centre de recherches sur les Arts du spectacle aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles (ACRAS, société savante), at Centre National de la Danse, 1 rue Victor Hugo – 93500 Pantin, and Maison de la Recherche, 28 rue Serpente, 75006 Paris.

{"id": "1323466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1323466", "title": "Official World Golf Ranking", "text": "Official World Golf Ranking\n\nThe Official World Golf Ranking is a system for rating the performance level of male professional golfers (although there is no rule prohibiting women from being ranked). It was introduced in 1986 and is endorsed by the four major championships and six major professional tours, five of which are charter members of the International Federation of PGA Tours:\n\nPoints are also awarded for high finishes on other tours:\n\nPrevious tours:\nThe initiative for the creation of the Official World Golf Ranking came from the Championship Committee of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, which found in the 1980s that its system of issuing invitations to The Open Championship on a tour by tour basis was omitting an increasing number of top players because more of them were dividing their time between tours, and from preeminent sports agent Mark McCormack, who was the first chairman of the International Advisory Committee which oversees the rankings. The system used to calculate the rankings was developed from McCormack's World Golf Rankings, which were published in his \"World of Professional Golf Annual\" from 1968 to 1985, although these were purely unofficial and not used for any wider purpose (such as inviting players to major tournaments).\n\nThe first ranking list was published prior to the 1986 Masters Tournament. The top six ranked golfers were: Bernhard Langer, Seve Ballesteros, Sandy Lyle, Tom Watson, Mark O'Meara and Greg Norman. Thus the top three were all European, but there were 31 Americans in the top 50 (compared with 17 at the end of 2010).\n\nThe method of calculation of the rankings has changed considerably over the years. Initially, the rankings were calculated over a three-year period, with the current year's points multiplied by four (three in 1986), the previous year's points by two and the third year's points by one. Rankings were based on the total points and points awarded were restricted to integer values. All tournaments recognised by the world's professional tours, and some leading invitational events, were graded into categories ranging from major championship (whose winners would receive 50 points) to \"other tournaments\" (whose winners would receive a minimum of 8). In all events, other finishers received points on a diminishing scale that began with runners-up receiving 60% of the winners' points, and the number of players in the field receiving points would be the same as the points awarded to the winner. In a major, for example, all players finishing 30th to 40th would receive 2 points, and all players finishing 50th or higher, 1 point.\n\nBeginning in April 1989, the rankings were changed to be based on the average points per event played instead of simply total points earned, subject to a minimum divisor of 60 (20 events per year). This was in order to more accurately reflect the status of some (particularly older) players, who played in far fewer events than their younger contemporaries but demonstrated in major championships that their ranking was artificially low. Tom Watson, for example, finished in the top 15 of eight major championships between 1987 and 1989, yet had a \"total points\" ranking of just 40th; his ranking became a more realistic 20th when based on \"average points\". A new system for determining the \"weight\" of each tournament was also introduced, based on the strength of the tournament's field in terms of their pre-tournament world rankings. Major championships were guaranteed to remain at 50 points for the winners, and all other events could attain a maximum of 40 points for the winner if all of the world's top 100 were present. In practice most PGA Tour events awarded around 25 points to the winner, European Tour events around 18 and JPGA Tour events around 12.\n\nIn 1996, the three-year period was reduced to two years, with the current year now counting double. Points were extended to more of the field, beginning in 2000, and were no longer restricted to integer values. Beginning in September 2001, the tapering system was changed so that instead of the points for each result being doubled if they occurred in the most recent 12 months, one eighth of the initial \"multiplied up\" value was deducted every 13 weeks. This change effectively meant that players could now be more simply described as being awarded 100 points (not 50) for winning a major. Beginning in 2007, the system holds the points from each event at full value for 13 weeks and then reduces them in equal weekly increments over the remainder of the two-year period.\n\nAt first only the Championship Committee of the Royal and Ancient used the rankings for official purposes, but the PGA Tour recognized them in 1990, and in 1997 all five of the then principal men's golf tours did so. The rankings, which had previously been called the Sony Rankings, were renamed the Official World Golf Rankings at that time. They are run from offices in Virginia Water in Surrey, England.\n\nSource:\n\nSimply put, a golfer's World Ranking is obtained by dividing their \"points total\" by the \"number of events\" they have played, which gives their \"average\". Players are then ranked; a higher average yields a higher rank.\n\nThe first stage in the calculation is the ranking of each event. For most events the ranking depends on the current world rankings of the participating golfers and the participation of the leading golfers from the \"home tour\".\n\nA \"world rating value\" is calculated. Any golfer currently ranked in the world top 200 is given a rating value. The world No. 1 is allocated 45, the No. 2 is allocated 37, the No. 3 is allocated 32, down to those ranked between 101 and 200 who are allocated a rating value of 1 each. The maximum possible world rating value is 925 but this would only happen if all the top 200 golfers were playing.\n\nA \"home tour rating value\" is calculated. The leading 30 golfers from the previous year's \"home tour\" are given rating values. Most tours use earnings lists for their top 30, but the PGA Tour currently uses the FedEx points list calculated after the playoffs. Major championships and WGC events use the current world top 30 list. The home tour No. 1 is allocated 8 down to those from 16 to 30 who are allocated a rating value of 1 each. The maximum home tour rating value is 75 if all the top 30 players from the home tour are competing. The total home tour rating value is limited to 75% of the world rating value.\n\nThe world rating value and home tour rating value are added together to give a total rating value. This is then converted into an event ranking using a table. As examples, a total rating value of 10 converts to an event ranking of 8, a total rating value of 100 converts to an event ranking of 24, while a total rating value of 500 converts to an event ranking of 62.\n\nMajor championships have a fixed event ranking of 100 points. For each tour, there is a minimum ranking for each event. In addition, most tours have a \"flagship event\" that is guaranteed a higher ranking.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Previously the Thailand Golf Championship\n\nStarting in 2012, several events that previously had not received any points, now do so: Sunshine Tour \"Winter Series\" – 6 points (72-hole events), 4 points (54-hole events), PGA Tour of Australasia \"State Based and Regional Tournaments\" – 6 points.\n\nStarting in July 2015, the four third-tier European tours receive points: 6 points for 72-hole events and 4 points for 54-hole events. In April 2016, the Korean Tour's minimum was increased from 6 to 9 points and the MENA Golf Tour was added.\n\nStarting in 2018, the Sunshine Tour Big Easy Tour will factor into the World Rankings, making it the 20th professional tour included in the OWGR. For 2018, the European Tour-linked China Tour was added, expanding that total to 21. \n\n72-hole tournaments which are reduced to 54 holes retain full points, but if a tournament is reduced to 36 holes, its points allocation is reduced by 25%. 54-hole tournaments reduced to 36 holes retain full points.\n\nOneAsia Tour, whose events previously earned a minimum of 6 points, lost its eligibility for world ranking points in 2018.\n\nThe events with the highest \"Total Rating\" in 2017 are shown in the following table.\n\nHaving calculated the ranking of the event, the ranking points of the players for that event can be calculated. The winner's ranking points are the same as the ranking of the event, so that major winners get 100 ranking points. The second place golfer gets 60% of this amount, 40% for 3rd, 30% for 4th, 24% for 5th, down to 14% for 10th, 7% for 20th, 3.5% for 40th to 1.5% for 60th. Players tied for a position share the points for those positions so that if, for example, two players tie for second place they would each receive 50%, the average of 60% and 40%.\n\nA player's ranking points for an event must be at least 1.2. Players who would get less than this using the above formula get no ranking points. For example, if an event has a ranking of 10 only the leading 12 players (and ties) receive any ranking points since the player in 12th place gets 12% of the event ranking (i.e. 1.2). The player in 13th position gets no points. Where there is a tie for the final scoring place, those players are guaranteed to receive at least 1.2 points. Using the above example, if there were two or more players tied for 12th place, each would receive 1.2 points. The only exceptions to this system are in the major championships where all players who make the cut get a minimum of 1.5 ranking points.\n\nFor the first 13 weeks after an event the player receives the full ranking points earned in that event. However, from then onwards they are reduced in equal weekly increments over the remainder of a two-year period. This gives priority to recent form. Each week the ranking points are reduced by a factor of 1/92 (approximately 1.09%) so that in week 14 only 98.91% of the ranking points are credited, continuing until week 104 when only 1.09% is credited. From week 105 the ranking points are completely lost.\n\nThe player's adjusted points for all events in the two-year period are then added together, and this total is divided by the number of events to give the average ranking. However, players are subject to both a minimum and maximum number of events over the two-year period.\n\nIf a player competes in fewer than 40 tournaments over the two-year period his adjusted points total is divided by 40 and not the actual number of events he has played in.\n\nIn 2010, a maximum number of tournaments was also introduced. The maximum number was initially set to 60 from January 2010 and was reduced by 2 every six months until it reached 52 in January 2012. This means that since 2012 only the player's 52 most recent tournaments (within the two-year period) are used to calculate his ranking average.\n\nThe resulting averages for all players are put into descending order to produce the ranking table. This means that the player who has obtained most cumulative success does not necessarily come top of the rankings: it is \"average\" performance levels that are important, and some golfers play substantially more tournaments than others. New rankings are released every Monday.\n\nA professional golfer's ranking is of considerable significance to his career. Currently a ranking in the World Top 50 grants automatic entry to all the majors and World Golf Championships; see table below. In addition, rankings are the sole criterion for selection for the International Team in the Presidents Cup, while ranking points are one of the qualification criteria for the European Ryder Cup team. The rankings are also used to help select the field for various other tournaments.\n\nNote: The PGA Championship does not have an official automatic entry based on the Official World Golf Ranking. However, the PGA of America invites additional players, and traditionally has invited those in the top 100 for the last several years. It makes note of its strong field by referencing the number of top 100 ranked golfers entered in its press releases.\n\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics, the top-15 world-ranked players will be eligible, with a limit of four players from a given country. Beyond the top-15, players will be eligible based on the world rankings, with a maximum of two eligible players from each country that does not already have two or more players among the top-15. Within the 60 players participating, each of the five continents of the Olympic Movement will be guaranteed at least one player and the host nation will be guaranteed one player.\n\nThese are the top 10 ranked golfers and their average ranking points as of December 2, 2018, which is the end of week 48.\n\nSince the major revision of the rating method in September 2001, the highest points average as well as the largest lead in points average were set by Tiger Woods on September 16, 2007. After winning the BMW Championship and The Tour Championship in consecutive weeks, he had an average of 24.36 and a lead of 14.73 points over Phil Mickelson.\n\nTiger Woods holds the record for most weeks in the World Top 10, with 860. He is followed by Ernie Els (788 weeks) and Phil Mickelson (774 weeks). Woods had a record run of 736 consecutive weeks in the top-10 from April 13, 1997 to May 15, 2011 and then had a further run of 124 consecutive weeks in the top-10 from March 25, 2012 to August 3, 2014.\n\nThe first official ranking list was published prior to the Masters in April 1986, with Bernhard Langer the first world No. 1 ranked player, ahead of Seve Ballesteros, who had topped the unofficial McCormack's World Golf Rankings at the end of the previous year. Ballesteros briefly held the No. 1 spot after Langer, before Greg Norman's worldwide success over the rest of that season made him the first year-end No. 1. Ballesteros took the No. 1 position back from Norman in 1987, and the pair exchanged the No. 1 position several times over the next two years. During 1990, Nick Faldo remained ranked just behind Norman despite winning three majors in two years (and more world ranking points in total than his rival, albeit having entered more events). As detailed in Mark McCormack's \"World of Professional Golf 1991\" annual, it was also the case (but less immediately apparent) that Norman had won a total of 14 events during the ranking period to Faldo's 10, and when the two had competed in the same tournament, had finished ahead of his rival 19 times to 11, so Norman's No. 1 position (on the new \"average points\" system) had some justification. Faldo did inherit the No. 1 ranking for the first time early in 1991.\n\nIn April 1991, a quirk in the way the rankings treated results from previous years meant that Ian Woosnam, who had never won a major, took the No. 1 spot from Faldo on the eve of the latter's attempt to win the Masters for a third year in succession; as if justifying the ranking system, Woosnam—and not Faldo—won the tournament. Twelve months later, Fred Couples similarly took over the No. 1 ranking shortly before the 1992 Masters, then also went on to make that tournament his first major victory. Faldo's Open victory in 1992 lifted him back to the No. 1 position, and he held that spot until replaced by Nick Price, who in 1994 became the first African ranked No. 1 after his back-to-back major victories that summer.\n\nBy 1996, Greg Norman had regained the top spot and ended 1996 and 1997 narrowly ahead of first Tom Lehman, and then Tiger Woods and Ernie Els in the rankings, despite his rivals enjoying major victories in those years while he won none. Lehman, Els and Woods would all briefly become No. 1 during 1997, Lehman for a week – to date, the only player to hold the No. 1 ranking for just one week. In 1996, Colin Montgomerie also led the rankings in total points earned over the two-year period (but never on average points per event); in 1997 Els was top of a similar \"total points\" list. Those were the last occasions on which a player led on \"total\" points but not average points until 2016, when Dustin Johnson similarly had more points in total than the world number one Jason Day. Woods then finished 1998 narrowly ahead of Mark O'Meara even though the latter won two major titles that year while Woods won just once on the PGA Tour. In March 1999, David Duval became world No. 1 after winning The Players Championship, his sixth victory in a twelve-month period that came before his first major victory (which would follow two years later at the Open Championship).\n\nIn 2000, Tiger Woods had an unprecedented season of success that saw him earn 948 world ranking points in a single calendar year, so many points that even had his 1999 points (which represented the previous single-season record) been totally discounted from the calculation, Woods would still have had a points average easily high enough to lead the rankings – and Woods would still have led at the end of 2001 even had he earned no further points that year. Tiger Woods dominated the No. 1 spot for the following five years, but when Vijay Singh won the PGA Championship in 2004 and with it took the No. 1 ranking, that change highlighted the fact that Woods had not won a major for over two years, and also the extraordinary success Singh had recently on tour had that had allowed him to overtake the American. Woods responded by winning the very next major, the 2005 Masters, and with it regained the No. 1 spot, which he would then retain for a further five years. Following knee surgery in the summer of 2008, Woods missed the entire second half of the year, while Pádraig Harrington won two major championships, to add to the Open Championship he won in 2007. Despite earning no further ranking points during his absence, Woods remained No. 1 on the ranking system in December 2008.\n\nDuring 2010, there was much debate as to whether Woods' continued retention of the No. 1 ranking (which he held up until the end of October) was justified given his relatively poor form—Woods finished fourth in two major championships in 2010, but failed to finish in the top ten of any other events he entered. During the 2010 season, several of his rivals for the No. 1 spot - including Masters champion Phil Mickelson (who had won four majors since 2004 but had yet to reach No. 1 in the rankings), Lee Westwood (who had yet to win a major but had finished second in both the Masters and Open Championships in 2010), and then Martin Kaymer (who had won the PGA Championship among four worldwide wins)— each missed opportunities to win particular events that would have taken them above Woods, before Westwood finally became world No. 1 on October 31.\n\nDuring 2011, the possession of the No. 1 ranking would be the subject of much discussion among European golf commentators as it passed from Westwood to Kaymer, back to Westwood and then in May to Luke Donald, who took No. 1 spot by defeating Westwood in a playoff for the BMW PGA Championship. Donald, in becoming the fifteenth world No. 1, also became the first ever to reach No. 1 before having won or finished runner-up in a major championship in his career. Donald's position at the top of the rankings was justified by his consistency through the rest of the 2011 season – becoming the first golfer ever to win the money title on both the European and PGA Tours in the same season.\n\nIn March 2012, Donald lost the No. 1 position to Rory McIlroy; the pair then exchanged the No. 1 position a further four times in the following two months, so the volatility of the No. 1 ranking again became a source of comment. At the end of 2012, McIlroy had opened up a clear lead at the top of the rankings, following his second major victory at the PGA Championship and emulating Donald in leading the money lists on both sides of the Atlantic. However, by the end of March 2013, a resurgent Tiger Woods had returned to the top of the rankings, after adding three PGA Tour wins in 2013 to his three victories from 2012 while McIlroy struggled with his form following equipment changes. Woods then suffered a back injury that sidelined him for the early part of 2014, and in his absence, Adam Scott, winner of the 2013 Masters, became the 17th world No. 1 on May 18, despite not winning an event in 2014 to that date; he would win the following week to secure his No. 1 position and avoid following Tom Lehman as a one-week No. 1. He held the No. 1 position until August 3, when McIlroy regained the top spot by following his Open Championship victory with another at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. Following his second-place finish at the 2015 PGA Championship (that followed earlier wins at the Masters and the U.S. Open), Jordan Spieth became the 18th world No. 1 on August 16, 2015, describing it as \"as good a consolation prize as I've ever had\". Over the following three weeks, the No. 1 spot passed back and forth between McIlroy and Spieth, due to the way each player's average points (which were almost identical) fluctuated (as their point weightings and events played divisors changed), until, on September 20, both were overtaken by Jason Day, the 2015 PGA Championship winner, who became the 19th world No. 1 with victory in the BMW Championship, his fifth of the season. A week later, Spieth regained the No. 1 spot from Day after winning the Tour Championship (and with it, the FedEx Cup), and concluded 2015 as world No. 1, but Day's continued good form took him back to number one after winning the WGC Matchplay in March 2016. \n\nOn February 19, 2017, Dustin Johnson became the 20th player to reach number one in the rankings following his victory at the Genesis Open. He would remain number one for over a year before being overtaken in May 2018 by Justin Thomas, who had won the PGA championship and four other events in 2017. Johnson regained top spot but was overtaken again in September 2018 by Justin Rose, who had finished second at the Open and again in two FedEx Cup playoff events. Rose became the 22nd player to reach number one, and the fourth Englishman. Johnson regained the number one position from Rose but was replaced by a new number one for a third time in 2018 on October 21, when Brooks Koepka added victory in the CJ Cup to his two 2018 major titles.\n\nA breakdown of the year-end top-100 by nationality.\n\nA breakdown of the year-end top-100 by eligibility for the major team competitions: Ryder Cup (USA vs. Europe) and Presidents Cup (USA vs. non-European international team).\n\n<nowiki>*Two men tied for 100th place.</nowiki><br>\n<nowiki>Note: The Presidents Cup was founded in 1994.</nowiki>\n\nThe table shows the World Rankings of the winners of each major championship in the week before their victory.\n\nAwarded to the player with the most weeks at No. 1 during calendar year and named after Mark McCormack, originator of the ranking.\n\nSee History section above for notes on changes to method of calculation.\n\nAlthough not recognized by any official award, these golfers have won the most World Ranking Points during the years for which the rankings have been calculated (points totals prior to 1996 are scaled to the current standard, i.e. major wins are worth 100 points):\n\nFrom 1996 to 2012, the International Federation of PGA Tours sanctioned a World Money List which was the total official money earned by a player on all member tours.

{"id": "27438785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27438785", "title": "Publications by Rupert Hart-Davis", "text": "Publications by Rupert Hart-Davis\n\nThis list of books published by Rupert Hart-Davis comprises titles reviewed in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" (1947 to 1974), plus reprints in the \"Mariners Library\" and \"Reynard Library\" series.\n\nAfter serving in the Second World War, Hart-Davis returned to his pre-war occupation as a publisher. In 1946 he founded Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd, in partnership with David Garnett and Edward Young and with financial backing from Eric Linklater, Arthur Ransome, H. E. Bates, Geoffrey Keynes, and Celia and Peter Fleming. His own literary tastes dictated which books were accepted and which rejected. Frequently he turned down commercial successes because he thought little of the works' literary merit. He later said, \"I usually found that the sales of the books I published were in inverse ratio to my opinion of them. That's why I established some sort of reputation without making any money.\"\n\nWhen the firm started, paper was rationed; they used Garnett's ex-serviceman's ration, but only one such ration per firm could be used so they could not use that of Hart-Davis. They were given the allocation at cost of a Glasgow bookseller and occasional prewar publisher, Alan Jackson. They decided to start initially with reprints of dead authors, as if a new book became a best-seller they would not have paper for a reprint and the author would leave the firm. They made an exception for Stephen Potter's \"Gamesmanship\" which was a short book; they collected every ream of paper they could buy, and printed 25,000 copies. Likewise 25,000 copies of Eric Linklater's \"Sealskin Trousers\" (five short stories) were printed.\n\nThe firm had best-sellers such as Stephen Potter's \"Gamesmanship\" and Heinrich Harrer's \"Seven Years in Tibet\", which sold more than 200,000 copies. Also in the early years Hart-Davis secured Ray Bradbury for his firm, recognising the quality of a science fiction author who also wrote poetry. Other good sellers were Peter Fleming, Eric Linklater and Gerald Durrell; but best-sellers were too few, and though the output of Rupert-Hart-Davis Ltd was regularly praised for the high quality of its printing and binding, that too was an expense that weighed the company down.\n\nWhen G. M. Young's life of Stanley Baldwin was published in 1952, both Churchill and Beaverbrook threatened to sue if certain passages were not removed or altered. With the help of the lawyer Arnold Goodman an agreement was reached to replace the offending sentences, but they had the \"hideously expensive\" job of removing and replacing seven leaves from 7,580 copies.\n\nBy the middle of the 1950s, Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd could no longer sustain an independent existence and in 1956 it was absorbed into the Heinemann group. Heinemann sold the imprint to the American firm Harcourt Brace in 1961, who sold it to the Granada Group in 1963, when Hart-Davis retired from publishing, though remaining as non-executive chairman until 1968. Publications by the firm after Hart-Davis's retirement are included in the list. Hart-Davis continued to contribute some books to the company's lists after he retired.\n\nThe Rupert Hart-Davis Ltd logo was a woodcut of a fox, with a background of oak leaves. The company was based at No. 36 Soho Square, London W1 from 1950, when they moved from 53 Connaught Street. Initially they planned to publish eight books according to their first advertisement in \"The Bookseller\", including \"Fourteen Stories\" by Henry James which was dated 1946 but did not actually appear until 14 February 1947. The annual book output according to Hart-Davis was: 1948, 16; 1949, 21; 1950, 25; 1951, 40; 1952, 37; (1953 not given); 1954, 41; 1955, 46; 1956, 45; 1957, 55 then 1962, 60. \n\nBook series published over the years by Rupert Hart-Davis included the \"Reynard Library\" of reprints of works from the great English writers, the \"Mariners Library\" of reprints of nautical books, and the \"Soho Bibliographies\" started with W. B. Yeats by Allan Wade in 1951.\n\n"}

The SAFE investor receives the futures shares when a priced round of investment or liquidation event occurs. SAFEs are intended to provide a simpler mechanism for startups to seek initial funding than convertible notes.\n\nThe precise conditions of a SAFE vary. However, the basic mechanics are that the investor provides a certain amount of funding to the company at signing. In return, the investor receives stock in the company at a later date, in connection with specific, contractually-agreed on liquidity events. The primary trigger is generally the sale of preferred shares by the company, typically as part of a future priced fund-raising round. Unlike a straight purchase of equity, shares are not valued at the time the SAFE is signed. Instead, investors and the company negotiate the mechanism by which future shares will be issued, and defer actual valuation. These conditions generally involve a valuation cap for the company and/or a discount to the share valuation at the moment of the trigger event. In this way, the SAFE investor shares in the upside of the company between the time the SAFE is signed (and funding provided) and the trigger event.\n\nUnlike a convertible note, a SAFE is not a loan; it is more like a warrant. In particular, there is no interest paid and no maturity date, and therefore SAFEs are not subject to the regulations that debt may be in many jurisdictions. This simplicity is the primary motivation of a SAFE. \"Safes should work just like convertible notes, but with fewer complications\", according to startup accelerator Y Combinator.\n\nY Combinator released the Simple Agreement for Future Equity (\"SAFE\") investment instrument as an alternative to convertible debt in late 2013. This investment vehicle has since become popular in both U.S. and Canada, due to its simplicity and low transaction costs. However, as use has become more prevalent, concerns have emerged as to its possible impact on entrepreneurs, especially where multiple SAFE investment rounds are done prior to a priced equity round, as well as possible dangers for non-accredited crowdfunding investors who might invest in SAFEs of companies that realistically will never obtain VC financing, and therefore never trigger a conversion into equity.\n"}
{"id": "4521503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4521503", "title": "Stuckist demonstrations", "text": "Stuckist demonstrations\n\nStuckist demonstrations since 2000 have been a key part of the Stuckist art group's activities and have succeeded in giving them a high-profile both in Britain and abroad. Their primary agenda is the promotion of painting and opposition to conceptual art.\n\nTheir demonstrations are particularly associated with the Turner Prize at Tate Britain (sometimes dressed as clowns to mock the museum), but have also been carried out at other venues, including Trafalgar Square and the Saatchi Gallery. There have also been other protests in the United States by US Stuckists, and there have been Stuckist events against the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nThey have received extensive media coverage for these events both in the UK and internationally, and become possible suspects for any London art protests, as in Matthew Collings' description of the opening of Tate Modern in 2000: \"Guilt-free art lovers crossed picket lines put up by envious artist-outsiders. They didn't know who was protesting out there. Maybe it was the Stuckists.\"\nThere is, however, no mention of any such demonstration on the Stuckism website. Sir Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate gallery, has recognised the demonstrations as a contribution to artistic debate, and the Tate archive contains material from the demonstrations, which are now a staple feature of the Turner Prize process.\n\nThe Stuckists were founded in 1999 by Charles Thomson and Billy Childish to promote figurative painting and oppose conceptual art. Thomson derived the name of the group from an insult by Tracey Emin to her ex-boyfriend Childish that he was \"stuck\". The original group of 13 artists has now grown to an international movement of 183 groups in 44 countries, as of November 2008. (Childish left the group in 2001.)\n\nThe Stuckists have demonstrated annually at Tate Britain on the occasion of the Turner Prize since 2000, and have been featured extensively in the media for their appearances. The demonstrations have adopted a variety of themes to make their point, which is simply that the prize is named after a famous painter, but painting is neglected by it in favour of other media. Their Turner Prize manifesto comments: \"The only person who wouldn't be in danger of winning the Turner Prize is Turner.\" This is a leaflet they have handed out to the public and prize ceremony guests. Although they have always been outside the building during the actual prize ceremony, they have, on two occasions, been mentioned by the guest of honour on live TV, just before the announcement of the winner—by Sir Peter Blake in 2003 and by Culture Minister, David Lammy in 2005.\n\nThe first Stuckist demonstration took place outside Tate Britain on Turner Prize day, 28 November 2000. The group took care to work within the regulations in order to subvert them and ridicule the institution. They were dressed as clowns, and had obtained advance permission to enter the museum in this costume. They announced on their web site (and in the London Evening Standard):\n\nDamien Hirst's godmother, the late Margaret Walsh, announced the \"Art Clown of the Year\" for \"outstanding idiocy in the visual arts\" was Charles Saatchi, the prize being a custard pie, which the winner was expected to purchase and administer on themselves. This award continued to be made in subsequent years.\n\nThey then paraded outside Tate Britain in clown costumes, walked into the museum and around the exhibition itself. To coincide with the Tate's show, they also staged their own concurrent show \"The Real Turner Prize Show\" with simultaneous shows of the same name in Germany and Australia. \"The Guardian\" announced the winner of the real Turner Prize with the headline \"Turner Winner Riles the Stuckists\".\n\nThere was a demonstration in ordinary clothes at the Prize press launch on 6 November. \"The Independent on Sunday\" said, \"In certain respects the Turner Prize never changes: art fleetingly makes the front pages; the dreary Stuckists protest outside the Tate and the winner gets a cheque for 20 grand.\"\n\nAnother demonstration took place on the Prize ceremony day, 9 December: this reached a worldwide TV audience, when it was syndicated by Reuters. The work of one nominee, Martin Creed, was an empty room, where the lights went on and off every five seconds. The demonstrators dressed in clown costume and shone torches in protest. Ekow Eshun wrote, \"if scandal equated directly to success then this year's winners should probably be the Stuckists, the ragged band of artist malcontents who've turned their annual placard-waving anti-Turner protest outside the Tate into a kind of art event of their own that now generates press attention from around the world.\"\n\nThe Stuckists gave their \"Art Clown of the Year Award\" to Sir Nicholas Serota. Other nominees were Charles Saatchi (the winner in 2000), Norman Rosenthal and Sarah Kent.\n\nThere was a demonstration at the Turner Prize press launch on 29 October, and one in clown costume on the prize day, 8 December. The \"Art Clown of the Year Award\" was given to Serota again, with the commendation, \"The judges were extremely impressed by Sir Nicholas's ability to create a Turner Prize show which was even worse than last year's\", and announced in \"The Daily Telegraph\" with the headline: \"A custard pie for Serota as Turner Prize winner named.\" Meanwhile, the Stuckism International Gallery staged \"The Real Turner Prize Show 2002\".\n\nIn 2003, the Stuckists displayed two blow-up sex dolls to parody Jake and Dinos Chapman's bronze (painted) sculpture modelled on one. As guests, including Jay Jopling, Tracey Emin, Victoria Miro and Jake Chapman, arrived, they were greeted with the announcement, \"Turner Prize preview—see the original here and the copy inside.\" Sarah Kent, art editor of Time Out, commented, \"Fucking Stuckists... yes, you can quote me.\" Inside Tate Britain, on live television, Serota introduced Sir Peter Blake, who before he announced the winner, started his speech: \"Thank you very much Nick. I'm quite surprised to be here tonight, because two days ago I had a phone call asking if I would be a judge for the Not the Turner Prize. And two years ago I was asked by the Stuckists to dress as a clown and come and be on the steps outside, so I am thrilled and slightly surprised to be here.\" There were cheers from the guests.\n\nThere were two Stuckist demonstrations, one at the press launch on 19 October and one at the prize-giving day on 6 December. On 10 October, Charles Saatchi had been quoted in the press as saying there were not enough painters in the Prize—\"For the last 10 years, only five of the 40 Turner Prize artists have been pure painters.\"\n\nThe Turner show itself was characterised by video and computer imagery, including a virtual tour of one of Osama bin Laden's former residences. Thomson was quoted by the BBC website: \"A lot of the stuff this year would be suitable for a Channel 4 documentary. There is no need for this to be in the Tate gallery when television does exactly the same thing.\"\n\nTo bring their point home, the Stuckists handed out a leaflet which read, with the mock tone of officialdom: \"We apologise for the lack of art in this year's Turner Prize. As an alternative, you will find a display of enthusiasts' television programmes and computer games.\"\n\nThey also announced:\n\nThe Stuckists demonstrated outside the Turner Prize on 6 December 2005 against the Tate's purchase of its trustee, Chris Ofili's work, \"The Upper Room\". They displayed placards with slogans such as \"£25,000 Turner Prize, £705,000 Trustee Prize\", and wore monkey and elephant masks, referring to the monkeys Ofili had painted in his work, as well as the trademark balls of elephant dung it was propped on.\n\nThe demonstrators were approached by Sir Nicholas Serota, and the atmosphere was tense, according to Thomson: \"I thought he was going to explode ... I looked at his face and I thought, this guy's going to lose it and hit me, or he's going to burst into tears.\"\n\nAndrew Marr, a guest at the evening Prize reception, commented, \"When they picketed us, the Stuckists seemed to me affable and intelligent people\", although he strongly disagreed with them over Ofili's work.\n\nThat evening in front of guests at the award ceremony in what Marr described as a \"moment of rare passion\" and an \"unusual, possibly unprecedented\" move, Serota spoke out with \"an angry defence\" of the purchase, saying, \"I defy anybody who has actually taken the time and trouble to see the work not to agree with the trustees' decision to acquire this most extraordinary and important piece of work.\"\n\nFollowing this, David Lammy, the Culture Minister, made a brief speech before presenting the award, commenting, \"Every year, the Turner Prize makes contemporary art the talk of the airwaves ... Stuckists threaten never to paint again\", (although there is no evidence they had ever made such a statement).\n\nThe Stuckists were included in reports on the Prize by the four UK broadsheets and in a Reuters syndication internationally, where Thomson commented, \"The Tate is run by a self-serving clique who hide behind secretiveness\" and \"The real prize at the Tate is becoming a trustee. It's worth far more money.\" The winner, Simon Starling had converted a shed into a boat and back again; \"The Times\" quoted Thomson that \"The Turner should be renamed the B&Q diy prize.\"\n\nThe Stuckists handed Sir Nicholas Serota a demonstration leaflet with a Turner Prize \"health warning\" on one side (claiming that \"the exhibits may cause drowsiness or headaches\") and Thomson's painting of him on the other. He held it up and said, \"Can't you make another image?\" Tate chairman Paul Myners informed demonstrating artist, John Bourne, \"We are grateful for the extra publicity the Stuckists have given the Tate\".\n\nThe Stuckists picketed the 2006 ceremony with placards bearing the slogan 'Is It All A Fix?', a quote from Turner judge Lynn Barber, who had broken with convention by writing about the judging process in \"The Observer\". She encountered the demonstrators, whilst going outside from the judging to have a cigarette, afterwards saying she was horrified to see her words displayed: \"The words were taken completely out of context (I dread to think how often celebs have said that to me in interviews, and how often I have disbelieved them) but now I am stuck with being a hero of the Stuckist tendency. I scuttled back into the Tate and survived three hours without nicotine rather than risk encountering them again. Thomson's quote that winner Tomma Abts' work resembled \"doodles done by a lobotomised computer\" appeared in \"The Times\" and in media abroad.\n\nThe Stuckists announced that they were not demonstrating for the first time since 2000, because of \"the lameness of this year’s show, which does not merit the accolade of the traditional demo\". They criticised the \"recycling\" of nominees as being laziness by the jury (two of the four had been nominated in previous years) and stated that Tate Chairman, Paul Myners had previously thanked them for giving the Tate extra publicity. They also claimed that Mark Wallinger had copied their idea of walking round a museum dressed in a costume, that he was indistinguishable from a Stuckist demonstrator, and that his work was \"utter bilge\", which had \"all the excitement of watching a pensioner do the shopping at Asda\".\n\nThere was a demonstration by the artists, wearing black top hats, on 29 September, the day before the show opened, when they gave out a leaflet with a \"Not wanted\" poster for Serota and button badges with the text \"The Turner Prize is crap\", although they had not yet seen the exhibition. Condemning the Tate's promotion of conceptual art and the lack of figurative painting in the show (citing Stella Vine as one painter who has been passed over), Thomson said, \"The work is not of sufficient quality in terms of accomplishment, innovation or originality of thought to warrant exhibition in a national museum.\" Demonstration material is stored in the Tate archive and Tate officials have thanked the demonstrators for generating publicity; Tate Britain director, Stephen Deuchar, said, \"In a sense, that is the whole point of the prize: to encourage public debate.\" Richard Brooks, writing in \"The Sunday Times\" said of the Turner Prize show, \"the mediocre standard has almost turned me into a supporter of the Stuckists.\"\n\nChildish and Thomson issued a Turner Prize manifesto, dated 1 September 2000. The text is:\n\nSir Nicholas Serota wrote to the Stuckists in 2005, rejecting a donation of Stuckist paintings, but saying he wanted to ensure \"the Tate archive, as the national record of art in Britain, properly represents the contribution of the Stuckist movement to debates about contemporary art in recent years.\" In 2006, Tate chairman, Paul Myners, thanked the Stuckists for providing the Tate with extra publicity.\n\nThe Stuckists had declared their opposition to Charles Saatchi from the outset, criticising what they saw as the vacuity of Britart: \"You can't help feeling that Saatchi's insipid sensationalism would make Duchamp wish that he'd never ever exhibited his piss-pot in the first place and had become a water-colourist instead.\"\n\nIn 2003, the Saatchi Gallery re-opened at County Hall with a Damien Hirst retrospective, which included the exhibition of his refurbished piece, \"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living\", a shark in a tank of formaldehyde. On the same day as the Saatchi opening, the Stuckism International Gallery in Shoreditch—under the title \"A Dead Shark Isn't Art\"— exhibited another dead shark, which had first been put on public display in 1989 (two years before Hirst's was first shown) by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch shop, JD Electrical Supplies. The Stuckists suggested Hirst may have seen this at the time and copied it, and pointed out that whether Hirst plagiarised Saunders work or not, Saunders was the real pioneering artist.\n\nIn February 2004, Saatchi bought \"Hi Paul Can You Come Over\", a painting by ex-stripper Stella Vine of Princess Diana with blood coming from the mouth (it was then exhibited in his next show, \"New Blood\"). There was international media reporting of this. Vine was talked of as \"the new star of the Brit art scene\", commenting, \"I didn't think anyone really liked what I was doing\", and that she had only been painting for four years \"after accompanying her son Jamie, 18, to Hampstead School of Art\" (a private college).\n\nThis caused a strong reaction from the Stuckists. Vine had for a short time been a member of their group, and they had first exhibited her in 2001, when she was also (briefly) married to Charles Thomson. She had even been a nominee for their \"Real Turner Prize Show\". \"The Independent\" newspaper validated these claims and reported Thomson's complaint that Saatchi had been \"stealing their identity as he tires of the Britart scene\".\n\nThomson and eleven other people (including non-Stuckists, such as David Lee and Christopher Fiddes of the Movement for Classical Renewal) then reported Saatchi to the Office of Fair Trading. The grievance was:\nHowever, the complaint was not upheld and the OFT pronounced, \"We do not have reasonable grounds to suspect that Charles Saatchi is in a dominant position in any relevant market\", which Thomson turned to advantage by spotting the unintended slight and remarking that it was \"just another cruel smack in the face\" for Saatchi.\n\nThe Stuckists' concerns were not alleviated, when, at the end of 2004, Saatchi announced that he was putting his Britart holding into storage and devoting the next year to exhibitions featuring only painting. A few months prior to this announcement, Saatchi had stood outside the Stuckism International gallery, reading not only a placard that declared \"STUCKIST ART IN 2001 IS SAATCHI ART IN 2004\" (referring to Stella Vine), but also the anti-conceptual art, pro-painting Stuckist manifesto, which was on display.\n\nThomson responded immediately in the press to the announcement of Saatchi's change of direction, with the accusation: \"almost verbatim, he's stolen the introduction to our manifesto.\"\n\nWhen the show, \"The Triumph of Painting\", opened at the Saatchi Gallery on 25 October 2005, the Stuckists mounted a picket outside, handing leaflets to the incoming guests (who included Saatchi's wife Nigella Lawson), and displaying placards stating, \"Stuckism leads, Saatchi follows\" and \"Stuckism in 1999 is Saatchi in 2005\".\nThey also wore tall hats with Saatchi's face on, and Thomson was photographed inside the gallery opening, wearing a T-shirt with the words \"Saatchi the Stuckist\".\n\nThe Stuckists demonstrated in 2001 in Trafalgar Square, when Rachel Whiteread's statue, \"Monument\", was unveiled. This was a resin cast of the fourth (vacant) plinth in the square, and was inverted on the existing plinth. It represents the type of conceptual art that the Stuckists strongly oppose. The statue was unveiled by the then-Culture Secretary, Chris Smith, against whom Thomson was standing in the United Kingdom general election, 2001 as a Stuckist candidate. At this point Stuckist protesters (one of whom was Stella Vine) in the watching crowd held up protest placards. Thomson jumped over the metal crowd barrier onto the now-vacant podium and used the PA system to make an address about the complete absence of paintings in that year's Turner Prize (referring to a comment by Smith the previous year that there should be more paintings in the Prize). At the same time he held up a placard, which read, \"Mr Smith, do you really think this stupid plinth is a work of art?\"\n\nWhen the PA system was switched off by an official, Thomson made his way back through the crowd and was surprised to find that an angry Serota had followed him.\n\nThe Stuckism website headed its report on the incident with a quote from Serota's book \"Experience or Interpretation\": \"a willingness ... to risk offence by unexpected confrontation can yield rewards\"\n\nIn 1999, the Stuckists art group had declared themselves \"opposed to the sterility of the white wall gallery system\", and, three years later, they opened their own Stuckism International gallery (with coloured walls) in Shoreditch in an adjoining street to the White Cube gallery, which represents Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst. To celebrate the opening on 25 July 2002, they dressed as clowns, processed the short distance from Charlotte Road over Old Street and deposited a coffin, marked \"The Death of Conceptual Art\", outside the White Cube's door with the comment, \"This is the official date for the demise of conceptual art.\"\n\nIn 2001, Stuckist Co-founder, Charles Thomson stood as a Stuckist candidate for the 2001 British General Election, on an anti-Britart ticket, in the constituency of Islington South and Finsbury, against Chris Smith, the Culture Secretary. Thomson picked up 108 votes (0.4%).\n\nIn spring 2003, artist Cornelia Parker was allowed by the authorities to wrap Auguste Rodin’s sculpture \"The Kiss\" (1886) in Tate Britain in a mile of string. Many people felt it offensive to the original artwork and an act of vandalism rather than art. As a reaction, Stuckist artist Piers Butler cut the string, while couples stood around engaging in live kissing. However, this was described as an individual action outside the main Stuckist group by Thomson, who nevertheless took the opportunity to remark: \"I was puzzled that Parker had been allowed to do her string-wrapping—thereby using another artist's work to promote her ideas—as this was precisely the allegation that an enraged Serota had thrown at me in Trafalgar Square and dubbed a 'cheap shot'.\"\n\nIn May 2001, the Seattle Stuckist group (J. Puma, Z.F. Lively, Amanda Perrin and Brett Hamil) protested with placards, such as \"Art-vertising is bad for the soul\" and \"Tacky and lame\", against \"Pigs on Parade\", large fibreglass pigs which had been installed in the city and decorated by artists to make money for charity. Their objection was to commercial devaluation of art through \"an insidious trend in corporate art-vertising. It appeals to the lowest public tastes by providing a kitschy, totally predigested and inoffensive McArt for the masses.\" (Social or ethical comment was banned from the designs.) King 5 News mentioned the group (with a \"glib chuckle\"), but otherwise the event went unreported. There was a certain amount of public support, and Hamil concluded: \"For some reason, Stuckists are saddled with the task of vocalizing what everyone already knows, and yet that doesn't make it any less valid. It just makes it that much more regrettable that no one's said it yet.\"\n\nIn order to \"highlight the fact that the Iraq War does not have the support of the United Nations, thus violating a binding contract with the UN\", \"The Clown Trial of President Bush\" took place at 7 p.m. on March 21, 2003 on the steps of the New Haven Federal Courthouse, staged by local Stuckist artists dressed in clown costume, led by Jesse Richards, Nicholas Watson and Tony Juliano. One of the participants was \"a public defender for the state of CT. He thought it would be cool to dress up with us as clowns and do the thing. He ended up playing the clown judge. The courthouse that he works at is a block away from the federal courthouse where we did this.\"\n\nSimultaneously the New Haven Stuckism International gallery run by them opened a \"War on Bush\" show, including work from Brazil, Germany and the UK, while the London Stuckism International Gallery staged a \"War on Blair\" show. \"The Yale Herald\" reported with the headline, \"Stuckists scoff at 'crap,' war\". Richards took the opportunity to comment, \"Duchamp would go over to the Yale University Art Gallery and he would say, 'This is crap,' and he would go paint a picture.\" \n\nThe Stuckists have made use of their art shows in order also to promote a message. The name of the group itself is an ironic pre-emptive riposte to their anticipated enemies—as represented in the first instance by former colleague-turned-YBA, Tracey Emin, who had called the group's co-founder, Billy Childish, \"stuck\". The group's first show in 1999 was titled, \"Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!\". In 2000, they made an overt challenge with a show titled, \"The Resignation of Sir Nicholas Serota\". A painting in the show, \"Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision\" by Charles Thomson, has since been reproduced in the media many times and become an iconic image for the Stuckists.\n\nIn 2005, another show was called: \"\"Painting Is the Medium of Yesterday\"—Paul Myners CBE, Chairman of Tate Gallery, Chairman of Marks and Spencer, Chairman of Aspen Insurance, Chairman of Guardian Media, Director of Bank of England, Director of Bank of New York. A Show of Paintings by the Stuckists, as Refused by the Tate Gallery. Guaranteed 100% Free of Elephant Dung.\"\n\n\"The Stuckists Punk Victorian\" exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery during the 2004 Liverpool Biennial including a free-standing screen with paintings attacking the Turner Prize and the Tate gallery.\n\nMichael Dickinson has exhibited political and satirical collages, addressing the Iraq War and world leaders, particularly US President George W. Bush. In 2006 he was told he faced prosecution in Turkey, where he lives, for his collage \"Best in Show\", showing the Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan as a dog. He was subsequently prosecuted for a similar collage, \"Good Boy\", and acquitted in a case that had implications for Turkey's application for membership of the European Union.\n\nThere has only been one known anti-Stuckist demonstration, which was in 1999, when two Chinese performance artists jumped on Tracey Emin's installation \"My Bed\", in the Turner Prize at Tate Britain. The pair had various words written on their bodies, including \"Anti-Stuckism\". Their explanation is that they were opposed to the Stuckists, who are anti-performance art. According to Fiachra Gibbons of \"The Guardian\", the event \"will go down in art history as the defining moment of the new and previously unheard of Anti-Stuckist Movement.\"\n\n"}

Maxwell based on the King James and Revised Standard versions of the Christian Bible. The books, published from 1953–57, retell most of the narratives of the Bible in 411 stories. Compared to the source material, the stories are sanitized for young readers, and gloss over elements Maxwell apparently found inappropriate for a child audience (there is, for instance, no mention of circumcision despite the relative prominence of this rite in the Bible text).\n\nThe books have been marketed in the United States for many years by placing the first volume, which covers the first part of the Book of Genesis, in doctor's offices with postage prepaid postcards included for readers to order the set or ask for more information. Originally written in English, the books have been translated into French and Spanish (as \"Las Bellas Historias de la Biblia\"), and a new revision has been made based on the New International Version (NIV) translation of the Bible.\n\n\"The Bible Story\" is jointly published by the Review and Herald Publishing Association and the Pacific Press Publishing Association, both closely associated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Although Arthur Maxwell himself was a Seventh-day Adventist, \"The Bible Story\" has received numerous endorsements from both Catholic and Protestant clergy alike.. The Seventh-Day Adventist slant is discernable especially in passages that deal with the Sabbath, which receives its own chapter (\"A Day to Remember\") in the first volume of the series. Here Maxwell elaborates on how God revealed the Sabbath to Adam and Eve:\n\nHe blessed the Sabbath so it would be a blessing to them. He set it apart as a holy day not for Himself, but for them. Even now six thousand years later, all who keep the seventh day holy, find a blessing in it that others never know!\n\nAs is evident from this quote, Maxwell also presupposes Young Earth Creationism with a literal six-day creation taking place six thousand years before the present, in accordance with Ussher chronology. The introductory chapter to the first volume encourages the reader to reflect on the origin of animals, humans and the earth itself, asking where everything came from. The reader is pointed to the Bible account as the only trustworthy source:\n\nMany great men have tried to explain these things [i.e., the origins of lifeforms and the planet itself]. They have come up with all sorts of strange ideas and suggestions, but most of them are far from the truth. In only one place - the Bible - will you find the true story. If you will open this wonderful Book, you will find that the very first part is called Genesis, meaning \"the book of beginnings.\" Here you will find the answers to your questions about where everything came from.\n\nAt the end of the chapter, Maxwell asserts that human lineages go back to God, thus explicitly dismissing the theory of evolution in favor of creationism.\n\n"}

Over the next decade it was adopted by many film studies courses around the world and translated into several languages.\n\nBy the time of the second edition in 1999, co-edited with Mieke Bernink, the film clip collection was deemed redundant and the book was transformed into an in-depth guide to film history and updated to include recent theoretical developments. A third revised edition appeared in 2007.\n\n\"The Cinema Book\" was one of the last books to be published by BFI Publishing as an integral part of the British Film Institute. Amid some controversy, the institute entered into a partnership deal with global publishers Palgrave Macmillan and BFI Publishing staff were relocated to Macmillan's offices in London's King's Cross in January 2008.\n\n1.

Pastries include biscuits, cakes, custards, puddings, pies and tarts. Confectionery includes candying and conserving flowers, fruits, and roots, as well as jellies, marmalades and decorative \"sugar-works\". Drinks include the making of beer, cider, mead, perry and English wines, as well as cordials. The book ends with a list of suggested bills of fare for every month of the year.\n\nThe book is prefaced with a four-page Introduction \"To All Good Housewives\", beginning \"Worthy Dames, Were it not for the sake of Custom, which has made it as unfashionable for a Book to come abroad without an Introduction, as for a Man to appear at Church without a Neckcloth, or a Lady without a Hoop-petticoat, I should not have troubled you with this.\" The introduction ends with \"Your humble Servant, The Compiler\". There follows \"Some Divertisements in Cookery, us'd at Festival-Times, as Twelfth-Day, &c.\"\n\nThe main text is laid out as a dictionary from Al to Zest. It included items now unfamiliar, such as Battalia Pye of Fish, a \"very large Pye, and cut with Battlements ... with as many Towers as will contain your several sorts of Fish\", which included salmon, cockles, prawns, oysters, and periwinkles.\n\nThis is followed by Bills of Fare, Terms of Art for Carving, Instructions for Carving, The Manner of Setting out a Desert of Fruits and Sweet-meats, and the Alphabetical Index.\n\nSince the main text is an alphabetical list, there are no sections, and the recipes stand alone without instructions on kitchen equipment or general comments on types of dish.\n\nThe entries are named, either like \"Asparagus with Butter\" as dishes, or like \"To make an Amlet of Asparagus\" as goals to be attained. The ingredients are not listed. Quantities, if mentioned at all, are simply included in the text, as \"an Egg or two\", relying on the cook's judgement as to the exact quantity needed. Cooking conditions are similarly mentioned only in passing, as \"over a gentle Fire\". For example:\n\n\nNott's recipe for hot chocolate is said to be delicious. The bibliographer William Carew Hazlitt, in his 1902 \"Old Cookery Books\", considered Nott well-read and intelligent as he drew his recipes from many sources at home and abroad, including \"to dress mutton the Turkish way\".\n\nNott's \"Queen's Pottage\" is recreated at \"The Gilbert Scott\" restaurant, though \"The Telegraph\" notes that the chef, Marcus Wareing, omits the original cockscombs. Nott's Salmagundy is likewise reworked by Heston Blumenthal in his \"Dinner\" restaurant.\n\n\"The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets\" notes that the \"ubiquitous\" crème brûlée appeared in the \"Dictionary\", but that Elizabeth David had traced Nott's version to François Massialot's recipe in his 1691 \"Cuisinier royal et bourgeois\", rendered as \"Burnt Cream\" in the English translation of his book, \"The Court and Country Cook\" of 1702. The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation comments that Nott seems to have plagiarized \"heavily\" from Robert May as well as Massialot, without explanation.\n"}

{"id": "4168623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4168623", "title": "Turkic mythology", "text": "Turkic mythology\n\nTurkic mythology embraces Tengriist and Shamanist and as well as all cultural and social subjects being a nomad folk. Later, especially after Turkic migration some of the myths were decorated with Islamic symbols. It has numerous common points with Mongol mythology and both of them were probably originated in a proto syncretic Tibetan Buddhist and nationalist mythology. Turkic mythology was influenced by other local mythologies. For example, in Tatar mythology elements of Finnic and Indo-European myth co-exist. Subjects from Tatar mythology include Äbädä, Alara. Şüräle, Şekä, Pitsen, Tulpar, and Zilant. Turks appearently practised all major religions, such as Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism and Manichaeism before, the majority of Turks confessed to islam. Turks often syncretised the other religion into their prevailing mythological understanding.\n\n\"Irk Bitig\", a 10th-century manuscript found in Dunhuang is one of the most important sources for Turkic mythology and religion. This book is written in Old Turkic alphabet like the Orkhon inscriptions.\n\nKök Tengri is the first of primordial deities in the religion of the early Turkic people. He was known as yüce or yaratıcı tengri (Creator God) after the Turks started to migrate and leave middle Asia, and see monotheistic religions Tengrism was changed from its pagan/politheistic origins. The religion was more like zoroastrianism after its change, with only two of the original gods remaining, Tengri, representing the good god and Uçmag ( a place like heaven or vallhalla), while Erlik took the position of the bad god and hell. The words Tengri and Sky were synonyms. It is unknown how Tengri looks. He rules the fates of entire people and acts freely. But he is fair as he awards and punishes. The well-being of people depends on his will. Tengri worship is first attested in the Old Turkic Orkhon inscriptions of the early 8th century.\n\nUmay (The Turkic root umāy originally meant 'placenta, afterbirth') is the goddess of fertility and virginity. Umay resembles earth-mother goddesses found in various other world religions and is the daughter of Tengri.\n\nÖd Tengri Is the god of time being not well-known, as it states in the orhun stones, \"Öd tengri is the ruler of time\" and son of Kök Tengri.\n\nBoz Tengri Like Öd Tengri, he is not known much. He is seen as the god of the grounds and steppes and is a son of Kök Tengri.\n\nKayra is the Spirit of God. Primordial god of highest sky, upper air, space, atmosphere, light, life and son of Kök Tengri.\n\nÜlgen is the son of Kayra and Umay is the god of goodness. The Aruğ (Arı) denotes to \"good spirits\" in Turkic and Altaic mythology. They are under the order of Ülgen and doing good things on earth.\n\nErlik is the god of death and the underworld.\n\nAy Dede is the moon god.\n\nGün Ana is the sun goddess.\n\nAs a result of the nomad culture, the horse is also one of the main figures of Turkic mythology; Turks considered the horse an extension of the individual -though generally dedicated to the male- and see that one is complete with it. This might have led to or sourced from the term \"at-beyi\" (horse-lord).\n\nThe dragon (Evren, also Ebren), also expressed as a snake or lizard, is the symbol of might and power. It is believed, especially in mountainous Central Asia, that dragons still live in the mountains of Tian Shan/Tengri Tagh and Altay. Dragons also symbolize the god Tengri (Tanrı) in ancient Turkic tradition, although dragons themselves are not worshiped as gods.\n\nThe World Tree or Tree of Life is a central symbol in Turkic mythology. According to the Altai Turks, human beings are descended from trees. According to the Yakuts, White Mother sits at the base of the Tree of Life, whose branches reach to the heavens where it is occupied by various creatures that have come to life there. The blue sky around the tree reflects the peaceful nature of the country and the red ring that surrounds all of the elements symbolizes the ancient faith of rebirth, growth and development of the Turkic peoples.\n\nThe wolf symbolizes honor and is also considered the mother of most Turkic peoples. Asena is the name of one of the ten sons who were given birth by a mythical wolf in Turkic mythology.\n\nThe legend tells of a young boy who survived a raid on his village. A she-wolf finds the injured child and nurses him back to health. He subsequently impregnates the wolf which then gives birth to ten half-wolf, half-human boys. One of these, Ashina, becomes their leader and establishes the Ashina clan which ruled the Göktürks and other Turkic nomadic empires. The wolf, pregnant with the boy's offspring, escaped her enemies by crossing the Western Sea to a cave near to the Qocho mountains, one of the cities of the Tocharians. The first Turks subsequently migrated to the Altai regions, where they are known as expert in ironworkers, as the Scythians are also known to have been.\n\nThe Ergenekon legend tells about a great crisis of the ancient Turks. Following a military defeat, the Turks took refuge in the legendary Ergenekon valley where they were trapped for four centuries. They were finally released when a blacksmith created a passage by melting rock, allowing the gray wolf Asena to lead them out. A New Year's ceremony commemorates the legendary ancestral escape from Ergenekon.\n\nThe legend of Oghuz Khagan is a central political mythology for Turkic peoples of Central Asia and eventually the Oghuz Turks who ruled in Anatolia and Iran. Versions of this narrative have been found in the histories of Rashid ad-Din Tabib, in an anonymous 14th-century Uyghur vertical script manuscript now in Paris, and in Abu'l Ghazi's Shajara at-Turk and have been translated into Russian and German.\n\nBook of Dede Korkut from the 11th century covers twelve legendary stories of the Oghuz Turks, one of the major branches of the Turkish Peoples. It originates from the pre-Islamic period of the Turks, in which Tengriist elements in the Turkic culture were still predominate. It consists of a prologue and twelve different stories. The legendary story which begins in Central Asia is narrated by a dramatis personae, in most cases by Korkut Ata himself.Korkut Ata heritage (stories, tales, music related to Korkut Ata) presented by Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkey was included in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO in November 2018 as an example of multi-ethnic culture.\n\nThe legend of Timur (Temir) is the most ancient and well-known. Timur found a strange stone that fell from the sky (an iron ore meteorite), making the first iron sword from it. Today, the word \"demir\" means \"iron\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
