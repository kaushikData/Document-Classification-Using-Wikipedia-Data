An adaptation of the 1987–91 television series of the same name by Stephen J. Cannell and Patrick Hasburgh, the film follows two police officers who are forced to relive high school when they are assigned to go undercover as high school students to prevent the outbreak of a new synthetic drug and arrest its supplier.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on March 16, 2012 by Columbia Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and grossed $201 million against a budget of $54.7 million. A sequel, titled \"22 Jump Street\", was released on June 13, 2014. Two further films, \"MIB 23\" (a crossover with the \"Men in Black\" franchise) and a female-led spin-off, are currently in development.\n\nIn 2005, scholarly student Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and popular underachieving jock Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) miss their school prom; Schmidt being rejected by the girl he asked to be his date and Jenko being barred from attending because of his grades. Seven years later, the duo meets again at the Police Academy and become friends and partners on bicycle patrol. They catch a break when they arrest Domingo (DeRay Davis), the leader of a one-percenter motorcycle gang, but are forced to release him after they failed to read him his \"Miranda\" rights.\n\nThe duo is reassigned to a revived scheme from the 1980s, which specializes in infiltrating high schools. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) assigns them to contain the spread of a synthetic drug called HFS at Sagan High School. He gives them new identities and enrolls them as students, giving them class schedules fitting their previous academic performances; Jenko taking mostly arts and humanities, and Schmidt taking mostly science classes, but the duo mixes up their identities. Schmidt gets a lead on HFS from classmate Molly (Brie Larson), and he and Jenko meet the school's main dealer, popular student Eric (Dave Franco). The two take HFS in front of him to maintain their cover. After experiencing the drug's effects, the duo discovers that Schmidt's intelligence now makes him popular, while Jenko's lax attitude is frowned upon.\n\nEric takes a liking to Schmidt, who develops a romantic interest in Molly. Jenko becomes friends with the students in his AP Chemistry class and finds himself becoming more interested in geeky hobbies and academic pursuits. Schmidt and Jenko throw a party at Schmidt's parents' house, where they are living during the course of their assignment, and invite Eric. During the party, a fight breaks out between Schmidt, Jenko, and some party crashers. Schmidt wins the fight, solidifying his social status and gaining Eric's trust. Jenko's friends hack Eric's phone to enable them to listen in on his conversations.\n\nAt a party at Eric's house, using the phone hack, Jenko and his friends overhear information about an upcoming meeting between Eric and his supplier, but also catch Schmidt making disparaging comments about Jenko. The rift between the duo grows as their new school life intrudes upon their official police work. Schmidt and Jenko track Eric to a cash transaction with the distributors of HFS – the motorcycle gang from the park – and a chase ensues on the freeway. They return to school, argue, and eventually begin fighting, which disrupts the school play. They are expelled from school and are removed from the Jump Street program.\n\nEric, stressed and terrified, recruits Schmidt and Jenko as security for a deal taking place at the school prom. While dressing for the prom, Schmidt and Jenko rekindle their friendship. At the prom, they discover that the supplier is the physical education teacher, Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle), who created the drug accidentally and started selling it to the students to supplement his teacher's salary. Having caught Eric smoking marijuana, he was able to persuade him into being his dealer.\n\nThe motorcycle gang arrives for the deal but Molly interrupts them and starts arguing with Schmidt. As a result, the gang leader recognizes Schmidt and Jenko, and orders his men to kill them. Two of the gang members reveal themselves as undercover DEA agents Tom Hanson and Doug Penhall (Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise), and former members of the 21 Jump Street program. In the ensuing gunfight, Hanson and Penhall are fatally wounded. Mr. Walters and Eric escape with the money and Molly as a hostage; the gang, Schmidt, and Jenko follow close behind. Jenko creates a homemade bomb and uses it to kill the gang. Mr. Walters shoots at Schmidt but Jenko takes the bullet to his arm, sparing Schmidt's life. In response, Schmidt shoots Mr. Walters, unintentionally severing his penis. As they arrest Mr. Walters and Eric (in addition to successfully reading the Miranda rights), Schmidt and Jenko reconcile their relationship and Schmidt and Molly share a kiss.\n\nBoth officers are congratulated and reinstated in Jump Street as Dickson gives them a new assignment: infiltrating a college.\n\nIn May 2008, Sony Pictures confirmed that a film adaptation of the series was under development. Jonah Hill rewrote an existing script by screenwriter Joe Gazzam and executive produced the film, as well as starred in the film. Hill has said he wanted horror director Rob Zombie to direct the picture. In May 2009, Hill described the film adaptation as being an \"R-rated, insane, \"Bad Boys\"-meets-John Hughes-type movie\". On December 21, 2009, it was announced that Sony was in talks with \"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\" directing duo, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, to direct the film. The film follows the same continuity as the TV series; Lord said, \"So, all of those events of the original happened. And now here we are 20 years later, and we're watching it happen to different people.\" However, the film features a highly comedic tone, departing radically from the more dramatic and earnest tone of the series.\n\nThe film was shot in and around the city of Metairie, Louisiana (suburb of New Orleans) in 2011, although the filmmakers took elaborate steps to disguise the location as a generic city named \"Metropolitan City\". They replaced distinctive street signs with signs using a Helvetica typeface, digitally removed billboards from local businesses (except the recognizable local RTA signs toward the end of the film as well as a Zatarain's billboard ad), and avoided filming locations with iconic New Orleans imagery. Despite this, signature landmarks such as the Crescent City Connection and distinctive French Quarter–area street are still partially visible. The main school used as the stand-in for the fictional Sagan High School was Riverdale High School, located in Jefferson, Louisiana. The naked baby pictures of Hill's character used in the film were actual pictures of Hill as a child.\n\nThe score for the film was composed by Mark Mothersbaugh. In September 2014, it was released by La-La Land Records on a double disc album, limited to 2,000 copies. The second disc of the album also contains the score from the film's sequel, \"22 Jump Street\", composed by Mothersbaugh as well. A modernized cover of the original television's theme song by Rye Rye (who had a small part in the film) and Esthero was released as a single in the iTunes Store.\n\nIn addition, a total of 21 songs were licensed for use in the film. The songs featured in the film include:\n\nThe premiere of \"21 Jump Street\" took place on March 12, 2012, at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, TX, during SXSW. The film opened in a wide release in theaters on March 16, 2012. \"21 Jump Street\" grossed $138.4 million in the United States and Canada and $63.1 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $201.6 million; it is also the top-grossing high school comedy film of all-time. The film grossed $13.2 million on its opening day. During the weekend, the film grossed $35 million, taking \"The Lorax\" out of the #1 spot that it held for its first two weeks.\n\n\"21 Jump Street\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray in Canada and the United States on June 28, 2012 and was released in the United Kingdom on July 9, 2012. Some of the Blu-ray bonus features include 20 deleted scenes and \"Johnny Depp on Set\" explaining how they brought Johnny Depp to reprise his role as Tom Hanson. It was revealed that Johnny wanted his character to die, but for unknown reasons. In one of the deleted scenes, Tom and his partner, Doug Penhall, were shown to have survived the shootout.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, the film has an approval rating of 85% based on 213 reviews and an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A smart, affectionate satire of '80s nostalgia and teen movie tropes, \"21 Jump Street\" offers rowdy mainstream comedy with a surprisingly satisfying bite.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 69 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale. Channing Tatum's performance was also lauded by critics.\n\nRichard Roeper of \"The Chicago-Sun Times\" gave the film a grade of a B+ saying, \"I didn't think we needed a \"21 Jump Street\", but it's actually kind of funny\".\n\nThe film was listed as the number 6 most illegally downloaded film of 2012 using the BitTorrent protocol with approximately 7.6 million downloads.\n\nOn March 17, 2012, Sony Pictures announced that it was pursuing a sequel to the film, signing a deal that would see Hill and Bacall return to write a script treatment that would be again developed by Bacall. Hill and Tatum returned to star in the film. They were executive producers as well, alongside producer Neal H. Moritz. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller returned to direct this sequel. The film was originally scheduled to be released on June 6, 2014. On May 8, 2013, it was announced that the film would be pushed back a week until June 13, 2014. The film's title was \"22 Jump Street\". Like the first film, \"22 Jump Street\" received positive reviews.\n\nOn September 10, 2014, \"23 Jump Street\" was confirmed. Channing Tatum has yet to sign on to the project. Tatum stated, \"I don't know if that joke works three times, so we'll see.\" On August 7, 2015, it was revealed that Lord and Miller will not direct the film, but instead write and produce. A first draft of the film's script has been completed.\nIn early 2015, a female-driven \"21 Jump Street\" film was rumoured to be in the works alongside the movie. However, with the announcement of the \"Men in Black\" crossover and no further updates, the status of the film is unclear.\n\nOn December 10, 2014, it was revealed that Sony was planning a crossover between \"Men in Black\" and \"Jump Street\". The news was leaked after Sony's system was hacked and then confirmed by the directors of the films, Chris Miller and Phil Lord, during an interview about it. James Bobin was announced as the director in March 2016.\n\nA female-driven \"21 Jump Street\" film is being developed. In December 2016, Rodney Rothman was announced as the director and screenwriter for the film. Rothman returns to the franchise after co-writing \"22 Jump Street\", and \"MIB 23\" as well.\n\n"}
{"id": "653151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=653151", "title": "Acid-free paper", "text": "Acid-free paper\n\nAcid-free paper is paper that if infused in water yields a neutral or basic pH (7 or slightly greater). It can be made from any cellulose fiber as long as the active acid pulp is eliminated during processing. It is also lignin- and sulfur-free. Acid-free paper addresses the problem of preserving documents and artwork for long periods.\n\nPaper made from wood-based pulp that has not had its lignin removed turns yellow, becomes brittle, and deteriorates over time. When exposed to light and/or heat, the molecules in the acidic paper will break down even faster. Acidic wood-pulp paper became commonplace in the late 19th century, and in the 1930s William Barrow (a chemist and librarian) published a report about the deterioration of acidic paper in the libraries. For fear of the gradual disintegration of written materials, measures have since been taken to improve the quality of paper.\n\nDuring production, acid-free paper may be treated with a mild base (usually calcium or magnesium bicarbonate) to neutralize the natural acids occurring in wood pulp, and it may also be buffered to prevent the formation of additional acids (as may develop from the application of sizing).\n\nThe bicarbonate is added in excess, to supply the paper with an alkaline reserve to provide protection from further attack by acids remaining in the paper or supplied by the environment (e.g. atmospheric sulfur dioxide). The bicarbonate during drying loses carbon dioxide and water and is converted to calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate. In order for paper to last at least 100 years it must have an alkaline reserve of 2% or more.\n\nToday, much of the commercially produced paper is acid-free, but this is largely the result of a shift from kaolin clay to precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) as the main filler material in the pulp: PCC reacts with acids, and therefore requires the pulp to be chemically neutral or alkaline. The sizing additives mixed into the pulp and/or applied to the surface of the paper must also be acid-free.\n\nAlkaline paper has a life expectancy of over 1,000 years for the best paper and 500 years for average grades. The making of alkaline paper has several other advantages in addition to the preservation benefits afforded to the publications and documents printed on it. Because there are fewer corrosive chemicals used in making alkaline paper, the process is much easier on the machinery, reducing downtime and maintenance, and extending the machinery's useful life. The process is also significantly more environmentally friendly. Waste water and byproducts of the papermaking process can be recycled; energy can be saved in the drying and refining process; and alkaline paper can be more easily recycled.\n\nThe company Hercules Incorporated developed the first alkaline sizing in the 1950s that made acid-free paper possible. Despite the advances in paper making and the identification of and concern around the brittle book problem, it took decades before the adoption of ANSI NISO Standard Z39.48-1984 - \"Permanence of Paper for Publications and Documents in Libraries\" in 1984. This voluntary standard covered pH value, tear resistance, alkaline reserve, and lignin thresholds for paper to last thousands of years and was developed to encourage the use of acid-free paper in library materials. The development of the initial standard was a result of the work of the Council on Library Resources, which effectively lobbied ANSI to adopt the guidelines.\n\nIn 1986, Standards Committee II of NISO was established to expand Z39.48-1984 to develop standards for coated paper, and was again called upon in 1988 to review and revise the standards for uncoated paper.\n\nThere are various standards for \"acid-free\" paper, with differing requirements. In some quarters, slightly-acidic paper having a pH between 6 and 7 is often also considered \"acid-free\". Acid-free (alkaline) paper that additionally is \"uncoated\" and meets certain \"standards for folding and tearing\" is authorized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to carry the following notice: \"The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the American National Standard for Information Sciences—Permanence of Paper for Printed Library Materials, ANSI/NISO Z39.48-1992.\"\n\nThe objective of ANSI Z39.48-1992 \"is to establish criteria for coated and uncoated paper to last several hundred years\" under optimal conditions in libraries and archives. The desired outcome of the standard is to reduce future preservation problems.\n\nThe scope of the standard is to cover publications and documents bought and maintained by libraries and archives. Such works include scholarly journals, periodicals, monographs, government documents, original documents, and significant works in fiction and non-fiction.\n\nAn equivalent international standard, ISO 9706, was published in 1994.\n\nManufacturers of acid-free paper can indicate the compliance of their product with the test requirements of the ISO 9706 or ANSI Z39.48-1992 standards using a circled infinity symbol (Unicode code point 267E, ♾).\n\nArchival paper is an especially permanent, durable acid-free paper. Archival paper is meant to be used for publications of high legal, historical, or significant value. In the USA, such paper must also be approved in accordance with the ANSI standards. The international standard for \"permanent\" paper is ISO 9706 and for \"archival\" paper, the standard is ISO 11108.\n\nOften, cotton rag paper is used for archival purposes, as it is not made from wood-based pulp. Thus, \"archival paper\" is sometimes broken down into two categories:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6684585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6684585", "title": "Alcatraz Island Lighthouse", "text": "Alcatraz Island Lighthouse\n\nAlcatraz Island Lighthouse is a lighthouse – the first one built on the U.S. West Coast – located on Alcatraz Island in California's San Francisco Bay. It is located at the southern end of the island near the entrance to the prison. The first light house on the island was completed in 1854, and served the bay during its time as a Citadel and military prison. It was replaced by a taller ( above mean sea level) concrete tower built in 1909 to the south of the original one which was demolished after it was damaged due to earthquake in 1906. The automation of the lighthouse with a modern beacon took place in 1963, the year Alcatraz closed as the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. It is the oldest light station on the island with a modern beacon and is part of the museum on the island. Although when viewed from afar it easily looks the tallest structure on Alcatraz, it is actually shorter than the Alcatraz Water Tower, but as it lies on higher ground it looks much taller.\n\nEven though the Native Indians of the San Francisco area are stated to be the original settlers on the island (they collected eggs from the large flock of birds that regularly gathered there), Alcatraz got its name in 1775 only when Juan de Ayala, a Spaniard was engaged to survey the harbor and the San Francisco Bay. Since he observed pelicans in large numbers on the island he named the island as \"Isla de los Alcatraces\" meaning the \"Island of Pelicans\". The island is separated from the main land by more than .\n\nThe gold rush and the inherent risk of the choppy waters of the west coast prompted the urgent need for establishing lighthouses. Congress recognized the need and passed suitable acts in the years 1851 and 1852 to build seven lighthouses on the West Coast to guide navigation. The Baltimore firm of Gibbons and Kelly was awarded the contract to build seven lighthouses in California, at Alcatraz Island, Fort Point, Point Pinos, Point Loma, Farallon Island, and Humboldt Bay, and one at Cape Disappointment in Washington State. Equipment were shipped on Oriole, reached San Francisco on January 29, 1853. The Alcatraz Lighthouse was the first to be completed in July 1853, making it the oldest major navigational light on the West Coast. However, the foundation for building the light house had begun much before the equipment reached San Francisco.\nIn the original order placed for supply of the equipment Argand lamps and parabolic reflectors had been specified as the Fresnel lens, created by Augustin Fresnel of France in 1822 was considered very costly at that time. However, the Lighthouse Board which replaced the Fifth Auditor of the Treasury's control, decided to install Fresnel lenses in all lighthouses considering its established better performance, even though the cost was high. The Baltimore firm was informed of this change before the equipment was shipped. The shipping involved a long sea voyage of from the East Coast going round the cape of South America. It was lit on June 1, 1854, from a fixed, third-order Fresnel lens. In 1902, it was transferred to the Cape St. Elias Lighthouse in Alaska and replaced by a revolving fourth-order Fresnel lens, producing a white flash every five seconds.\n\nIn 1909–12, the present cell house of Alcatraz was built. Since the new structure would interfere with the operation of the lighthouse, a taller , concrete tower was built south of the original lighthouse. The original lighthouse had been damaged during the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and was eventually torn down. In 1963, the Alcatraz Lighthouse was automated by the United States Coast Guard. In 1970 a fire destroyed the warden's house, the keepers' quarters and other buildings on the island. The only remaining building is the tall cement tower equipped with a modern beacon. The lighthouse has been a museum since 2000 and can be visited. In over 50 years, the lighthouse has not been seriously damaged despite many prison escapes, the Battle of Alcatraz and fires.\n\nThe first lighthouse was in height, and was based on a design that was typical of early \"Cape Cod style\" lighthouses, in which the light tower was an integral part of the keeper's house, and was centered atop the dwelling's roof. Construction of the foundation started in 1852, and the one-and-a-half-storied keeper's house and light were completed in 1853. The lens arrived in October 1853 and Michael Cassin lit it on June 1, 1854, thus setting a \"milestone\" of sorts for this lighthouse, as the first lighthouse on the Pacific Coast. The old lighthouse was damaged in the earthquake which occurred on Wednesday the April 18, 1906. A new lighthouse was built to the south east of the old one. The old lighthouse existed alongside the new structure for a while and used as a storehouse, but was eventually demolished between 1912 and 1913.\n\nThe existing lighthouse is built to a height of , above sea level, to the south of the original lighthouse. Its foundation is made of masonry while the octagonal pyramidal shaped tower is made of concrete. Initially, a third order Fresnel reflector was installed in 1854, and was replaced by a fourth order reflector in 1903. The foghorn bell was replaced by electronic Klaxon. Near the base of the tower was family accommodation also built to house three keepers and their families. Similar \"Cape-cod style\" lighthouses, encircling the thick light brick tower, were built at Point Loma in San Diego, Point Pinos near Monterey and also on the Southeast Farallon Island about west of the San Francisco Strait. \n\nThere was also a telephone installed, in the 1930, in the keepers quarters (moved to the hall later) known to and accessed only by the keepers. When the Federal Penitentiary was established on the island more telephones were installed and was made accessible to others also.\n\nThe lighthouse was operated and maintained by the keepers whose responsibility included operation of fog signals found located on the northern and southern tips of the island. The prison guards facilitated the keepers to blow the fog horns as they were in advantageous position stationed on the elevated watch towers; the guards who were in position to see \"a bank of fog started to roll through the Golden Gate\", would inform notify the keepers so that the fog horns could be activated.\n\nThe leading marks which guide the ships while entering the island are the lime point which is east and the black point which is lime north. The island itself is interspersed with several buildings and military towers. The highest point of the island is where the light house is located. Northwestern and southeastern tips of the island have small buildings which housed the fog signals (the electric horns were installed in small buildings known as \"mid twentieth century foghorn shacks\".). The white light is shown by a grey tower flashes white that lasts for 0.5 seconds and eclipses' for 4.5 seconds and forming with the Fort Point light House a range for crossing the bar for the main ship. Fog signals are electric sirens, one on the southeast end sounding two blasts of 4 seconds duration, every 30 seconds while the one on the northwest end gives a single blast every 20 seconds of 5 seconds duration.\n\nThe three lighthouse keepers, known as \"wickies\", were dressed in prescribed formal uniforms which consisted of a \"navy blue hat, sack coat, vest and trousers\". Decorative buttons and insignia patches adorned their uniforms. The keepers worked on an eight-hour shift with the beacon lighted all through the year; during day time the lens was covered and protected from sun rays.\n\nThe island's lighthouse keepers included:\n\n\n"}

He was raised in East Meadow, New York. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from New College at Hofstra University in 1971 and a Master of Library Science from Florida State University in 1972.\n\nAs a scholar-in-residence and guest speaker in synagogues and other Jewish organizations in the United States, as well as through the books he has written on Judaism, the Torah, Kabbalah, and Jewish genealogical research, Kurzweil's career has been focused around helping others to discover the Jewish tradition. During his 17-year tenure at Jason Aronson Publishers, he commissioned and published over 650 volumes of Jewish interest, a substantial contribution to the contemporary English-language Jewish library. Kurzweil has also been editor-in-chief of the Jewish Book Club, president of the Jewish Book Council, and editorial consultant for Jossey-Bass.\n\nKurzweil's book \"From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your Jewish Genealogy and Family History\" is considered to be a definitive introductory guide on the topic. Kurzweil has also authored two books in the for Dummies series: \"Kabbalah for Dummies\" and \"The Torah for Dummies\". His other books are \"On the Road with Rabbi Steinsaltz\", \"The Encyclopedia of Jewish Genealogy\" and \"My Generations: A Course in Jewish Family History\", which is commonly used as a textbook at synagogue schools in the United States.\n\nKurzweil's interest in writing formed early in his childhood. His first article, \"Today's Troubled Youth: A Teenager's View\", was published at the age of 15. It first appeared in \"Newsday\" and became nationally syndicated. It was included in the weekly current events reading supplement then commonly used in public schools in the United States.\n\nKurzweil spent ten years working as a freelance writer, writing articles for numerous publications including \"Hadassah\", \"National Jewish Monthly\", \"Moment Magazine\" and \"L.I.\" (\"Newsday\"'s Sunday magazine). He also contributed articles to \"The Jewish Almanac\" (1980), \"The Jewish Family Book: A Creative Approach to Raising Kids\" (1981), the three volumes comprising \"The Jewish Catalog\" (Jewish Publication Society in 1973, 1976 and 1980, a 1960's style compilation of do-it-yourself guides covering a wide range of topics of interest for Jewish people. Kurzweil contributed to articles about building a personal Jewish library, Judaica philately, and Jewish genealogy.\n\nHis interest in genealogy coincided with the release of Alex Haley's book \"\" and \"Catching the Wave\" in 1976. He wrote \"Past Shock: How One Man Took a Journey Back into His Family's History\", a feature article for \"L.I.\". The publication of this article initiated his career as both a professional writer and a public speaker. His weekly column, \"Finding Jewish Roots\", appeared in \"The Jewish Week\", a Jewish newspaper in New York, in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, Kurzweil wrote a cover story for \"New York\" magazine, \"Hizzoner's Roots\", a genealogical study of former New York City Mayor Ed Koch's past.\n\nMotivated by his own confused and inconsistent treatment of New York City's numerous beggars, Kurzweil, in \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime: The Treatment of Beggars According to Jewish Tradition\", poses 16 questions reflecting his ambivalence on accommodating their seemingly relentless requests for a handout. He then demonstrates how a relative novice can do research to find meaningful answers within the framework of the Jewish tradition.\n\n\"From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your Jewish Genealogy and Family History\" was first published in 1980 and has since been published in a third revised edition. The book provides information on Kurzweil's own family history quest in addition to step-by-step advice on gathering information on one's family history from family members, family papers, Holocaust research, immigration and naturalization records, and online databases, among other sources. A revised and updated version of this book was published by Jossey-Bass in 2004.\n\nAfter an extended period of time during which Kurzweil's efforts were focused on publishing books by other authors, Kurzweil returned to his own writing, with books such as \"On the Road with Rabbi Steinsaltz: 25 Years of Pre-Dawn Car Trips, Mind-Blowing Encounters, and Inspiring Conversations with a Man of Wisdom\" in 2006, \"Kabbalah for Dummies\" in 2007 and \"The Torah for Dummies\" in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, Jossey-Bass published \"Pebbles of Wisdom From Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz: Edited and with Notes by Arthur Kurzweil\". It includes the internationally renowned rabbi's thoughts on the big topics of life and spirituality, culled from more than thirty years Rabbi Steinsaltz's lectures, writings, interviews, and conversations.\n\nKurzweil's credits as an editor include, \"Behold a Great Image: The Contemporary Jewish Experience in Photographs\" in 1978 co-edited with Sharon Strassfeld. The book which was awarded first prize for design at the Philadelphia Book Show, was developed as a fundraising program by a Tzedekah Collective, a grassroots charitable fundraising initiative. The book was the culmination of a national photography project that aimed at capturing the modern Jewish experience. The top three winners received cash prizes, and the proceeds from the book were donated to charity. Other books Kurzweil has edited include \"The Strife of the Spirit\" in 1988, \"On Being Free\" in 1995 both written by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, \"Best Jewish Writing 2003\" and \"The Hadassah Jewish Family Book of Health and Wellness\" in 2006.\n\nFrom 1984 to 2001, Kurzweil acted as Editor-in-chief, publisher and Vice President at Jason Aronson Publishers during which time he published over 650 books on a wide range of topics pertaining to Jewish practice and belief. Notable authors that Kurzweil published include Adin Steinsaltz, Elie Wiesel, Shlomo Carlebach, Aryeh Kaplan, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and Zalman Schachter-Shalomi. From 2001 he has served as Judaica Consultant for Jossey-Bass. Jewish book projects that Kurzweil develops for Jossey-Bass are imprinted with the words \"An Arthur Kurzweil Book\" on each book's title page.\n\nAs a speaker, teacher, and scholar-in-residence, Kurzweil's teachings have covered various topics of Jewish interest, including the Talmud, Kabbalah, and genealogy. His Kabbalah courses are frequently based upon the contemporary book by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, \"The Thirteen Petalled Rose: A Discourse on the Essence of Jewish Existence and Belief\", which he has claimed has had more influence on his life than any other book.\n\nAmong the various forums at which Kurzweil has lectured and taught are Jewish educator conferences, such as the Conference for Alternatives in Jewish Education (CAJE), retreat centers, such as Elat Chayyim, The Aleph Society where he is the acting coordinator for the Talmud Circle Project, synagogues, schools, Jewish community centers, teacher conferences, and university groups, both in the United States and abroad. As a prolific lecturer and teacher, Kurzweil has been credited as \"one individual who has made a major contribution to the resurgence in adult Jewish education.\n\nKurzweil co-founded the first Jewish Genealogical Society in 1977 and was co-publisher with Steven W. Siegel of \"Toledot: The Journal of Jewish Genealogy\" (1977–1982).\nThere are now over 80 Jewish Genealogical Societies worldwide.\n\nIn 1999, Kurzweil was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies (IAJGS) His commemorative plaque read:\n\"In deep appreciation of your trailblazing work which teaches us that learning about Jewish family history is possible, despite ages of community destruction, Diaspora and the Holocaust. We will always be grateful that you showed us the way, and for your past and continued inspiration to all Jewish genealogists and new Jewish genealogical societies that continue to be created worldwide because of your vision.\"\n\nKurzweil serves on the Honorary Advisory Board for the International Institute for Jewish Genealogy (IIJG) and also heads a working group that is developing ethical standards for Jewish genealogy. The IIJG is committed to developing Jewish genealogy into a recognized academic discipline, within the realm of Jewish Studies and in association with a broad range of other sciences on an interdisciplinary basis.\n\nKurzweil was introduced to magic by his father who took him to a magic shop to help with a third grade school project.

Once this happens, the sequence must continue periodically, by repeating the same sequence of values from to . Cycle detection is the problem of finding and , given and .\n\nSeveral algorithms for finding cycles quickly and with little memory are known. Floyd's tortoise and the hare algorithm moves two pointers at different speeds through the sequence of values until they both point to equal values. Alternatively, Brent's algorithm is based on the idea of exponential search. Both Floyd's and Brent's algorithms use only a constant number of memory cells, and take a number of function evaluations that is proportional to the distance from the start of the sequence to the first repetition. Several other algorithms trade off larger amounts of memory for fewer function evaluations.\n\nThe applications of cycle detection include testing the quality of pseudorandom number generators and cryptographic hash functions, computational number theory algorithms, detection of infinite loops in computer programs and periodic configurations in cellular automata, and the automated shape analysis of linked list data structures.\n\nThe figure shows a function that maps the set } to itself. If one starts from and repeatedly applies , one sees the sequence of values\nThe cycle in this value sequence is .\n\nLet be any finite set, be any function from to itself, and be any element of . For any , let . Let be the smallest index such that the value reappears infinitely often within the sequence of values , and let (the loop length) be the smallest positive integer such that . The cycle detection problem is the task of finding and .\n\nOne can view the same problem graph-theoretically, by constructing a functional graph (that is, a directed graph in which each vertex has a single outgoing edge) the vertices of which are the elements of and the edges of which map an element to the corresponding function value, as shown in the figure. The set of vertices reachable from starting vertex form a subgraph with a shape resembling the Greek letter rho (): a path of length from to a cycle of vertices.\n\nGenerally, will not be specified as a table of values, the way it is shown in the figure above. Rather, a cycle detection algorithm may be given access either to the sequence of values , or to a subroutine for calculating . The task is to find and while examining as few values from the sequence or performing as few subroutine calls as possible. Typically, also, the space complexity of an algorithm for the cycle detection problem is of importance: we wish to solve the problem while using an amount of memory significantly smaller than it would take to store the entire sequence.\n\nIn some applications, and in particular in Pollard's rho algorithm for integer factorization, the algorithm has much more limited access to and to . In Pollard's rho algorithm, for instance, is the set of integers modulo an unknown prime factor of the number to be factorized, so even the size of is unknown to the algorithm.\nTo allow cycle detection algorithms to be used with such limited knowledge, they may be designed based on the following capabilities. Initially, the algorithm is assumed to have in its memory an object representing a pointer to the starting value . At any step, it may perform one of three actions: it may copy any pointer it has to another object in memory, it may apply and replace any of its pointers by a pointer to the next object in the sequence, or it may apply a subroutine for determining whether two of its pointers represent equal values in the sequence. The equality test action may involve some nontrivial computation: for instance, in Pollard's rho algorithm, it is implemented by testing whether the difference between two stored values has a nontrivial greatest common divisor with the number to be factored. In this context, by analogy to the pointer machine model of computation, an algorithm that only uses pointer copying, advancement within the sequence, and equality tests may be called a pointer algorithm.\n\nIf the input is given as a subroutine for calculating , the cycle detection problem may be trivially solved using only function applications, simply by computing the sequence of values and using a data structure such as a hash table to store these values and test whether each subsequent value has already been stored. However, the space complexity of this algorithm is proportional to , unnecessarily large. Additionally, to implement this method as a pointer algorithm would require applying the equality test to each pair of values, resulting in quadratic time overall. Thus, research in this area has concentrated on two goals: using less space than this naive algorithm, and finding pointer algorithms that use fewer equality tests.\n\nFloyd's cycle-finding algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at different speeds.\nIt is also called the \"tortoise and the hare algorithm\", alluding to Aesop's fable of The Tortoise and the Hare.\n\nThe algorithm is named after Robert W. Floyd, who was credited with its invention by Donald Knuth. However, the algorithm does not appear in Floyd's published work, and this may be a misattribution: Floyd describes algorithms for listing all simple cycles in a directed graph in a 1967 paper, but this paper does not describe the cycle-finding problem in functional graphs that is the subject of this article. In fact, Knuth's statement (in 1969), attributing it to Floyd, without citation, is the first known appearance in print, and it thus may be a folk theorem, not attributable to a single individual.\n\nThe key insight in the algorithm is as follows. If there is a cycle, then, for any integers and , , where is the length of the loop to be found and is the index of the first element of the cycle. Based on this, it can then be shown that for some if and only if .\nThus, the algorithm only needs to check for repeated values of this special form, one twice as far from the start of the sequence as the other, to find a period of a repetition that is a multiple of .\nOnce is found, the algorithm retraces the sequence from its start to find the first repeated value in the sequence, using the fact that divides and therefore that . Finally, once the value of is known it is trivial to find the length of the shortest repeating cycle, by searching for the first position for which .\n\nThe algorithm thus maintains two pointers into the given sequence, one (the tortoise) at , and the other (the hare) at . At each step of the algorithm, it increases by one, moving the tortoise one step forward and the hare two steps forward in the sequence, and then compares the sequence values at these two pointers. The smallest value of for which the tortoise and hare point to equal values is the desired value .\n\nThe following Python code shows how this idea may be implemented as an algorithm.\n\nThis code only accesses the sequence by storing and copying pointers, function evaluations, and equality tests; therefore, it qualifies as a pointer algorithm. The algorithm uses operations of these types, and storage space.\n\nRichard P. Brent described an alternative cycle detection algorithm that, like the tortoise and hare algorithm, requires only two pointers into the sequence. However, it is based on a different principle: searching for the smallest power of two that is larger than both and . For , the algorithm compares with each subsequent sequence value up to the next power of two, stopping when it finds a match. It has two advantages compared to the tortoise and hare algorithm: it finds the correct length of the cycle directly, rather than needing to search for it in a subsequent stage, and its steps involve only one evaluation of rather than three.\n\nThe following Python code shows how this technique works in more detail.\nLike the tortoise and hare algorithm, this is a pointer algorithm that uses tests and function evaluations and storage space. \nIt is not difficult to show that the number of function evaluations can never be higher than for Floyd's algorithm.\nBrent claims that, on average, his cycle finding algorithm runs around 36% more quickly than Floyd's and that it speeds up the Pollard rho algorithm by around 24%. He also performs an average case analysis for a randomized version of the algorithm in which the sequence of indices traced by the slower of the two pointers is not the powers of two themselves, but rather a randomized multiple of the powers of two. Although his main intended application was in integer factorization algorithms, Brent also discusses applications in testing pseudorandom number generators.\n\nR. W. Gosper's algorithm finds the period but not the starting point of the first cycle. Its main feature is that it never backs up to reevaluate the generator function, and is economical in both space and time. For example, if it is known a priori that the generator function has a period of 2 then 33 words is sufficient.\n\nA number of authors have studied techniques for cycle detection that use more memory than Floyd's and Brent's methods, but detect cycles more quickly. In general these methods store several previously-computed sequence values, and test whether each new value equals one of the previously-computed values. In order to do so quickly, they typically use a hash table or similar data structure for storing the previously-computed values, and therefore are not pointer algorithms: in particular, they usually cannot be applied to Pollard's rho algorithm. Where these methods differ is in how they determine which values to store. Following Nivasch, we survey these techniques briefly.\n\n\nAny cycle detection algorithm that stores at most values from the input sequence must perform at least formula_3 function evaluations.\n\nCycle detection has been used in many applications.\n\n"}

{"id": "938280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=938280", "title": "Frans Hals Museum", "text": "Frans Hals Museum\n\nThe Frans Hals Museum is a museum located in Haarlem, the Netherlands. \n\nThe museum was established in 1862. In 1950, the museum was split in two locations when the collection of modern art was moved to the \"Museum De Hallen\" (since 2018 called \"Hal)\". The main collection, including its famous 17th-century Frans Hals paintings, for which the museum is named, is located in the former \"Oude Mannenhuis\" on the Groot Heiligland.\n\nThe museum was founded in 1862 in the newly renovated former Dominican church cloisters located in the back of the Haarlem city hall known as the \"Prinsenhof\", and when it needed more space, it moved to the recently vacated location of the town orphanage in 1913. The collection is based on the large number of paintings owned by the City of Haarlem, which includes over 100 artworks seized from Catholic churches in the 1580s after the Protestant Reformation, and Haarlem art rescued from demolished local buildings from the 15th century onwards.\n\nIn 2018 the museum re-merged with \"Museum De Hallen\" to form a single museum called the Frans Hals Museum with two locations: \"Hof\" (located on Groot Heiligland) and \"Hal\" (located on Grote Markt).\n\nThe Haarlem \"Oude Mannenhuis\" was a hofje founded in 1609. The residential rooms were situated around a courtyard in the style of contemporary Haarlem Hofjes. Each of the thirty little houses was inhabited by two men; to be eligible to living there they had to be at least 60 years old, honest Haarlem residents, and single. They were required to bring their own household goods listed as a bed, a chair with a cushion, a tin chamberpot, three blankets, six good shirts and six nightcaps. They were locked in each night at eight o'clock in the summer and at seven in the winter. The residents had to make a weekly collection with a poor-box, and a statue of a man holding this can be seen in the entrance hall of the museum. The old men's home was governed by five regents, whose portraits, painted by Frans Hals in 1664, are on display.\n\nThough the men's home dates from 1609, only the main hall is still mostly intact. During the intervening centuries the complex was renovated beyond recognition, most notably by the previous inhabitants, the Haarlem municipal orphanage which made use of the complex from 1810 until 1908, when it moved to the Coen Cuserhof. During the French occupation, the old men still living in the hofje were moved a block away to the present-day Proveniershuis, when the art collections of the two institutions were merged. The art of both locations, as well as the art of several other former Haarlem institutions, is now in the Frans Hals museum collection. The most notable artworks from the Oude Mannenhuis are the two group portraits of regents and regentesses by Frans Hals. The inventory of the Proveniershuis was drawn up by Pieter Langendijk and though some of the paintings have since been reattributed, his list is largely intact. The impressive regents' rooms have been rebuilt from other Haarlem locations. A room on the street side has a curious keystone above the door with masonic symbols denoting a mason's society and the text 'Metsselaars Proef-Kamer 1648 12/29'.\n\nThe older pieces of the museum collection, consisting of primarily religious themes, are Haarlem relics from the Reformation, when all Roman Catholic art was formally seized by the city council in 1648. Frans Hals himself worked as the first official city-paid restorer for some of these pieces. The city council then proceeded in the 17th century to rewrite Haarlem history, and purchased various large pieces to decorate the city hall, telling stories such as the legend of Damiate, or the legend of the Haarlem Shield. During this time the city hall functioned as a semi-public museum, though the term didn't even exist yet. The first signs of an official museum with a curator occurred when the Dutch Society of Science, founded in 1752, started to rent the Prinsenhof room of the city hall in 1754 for its meetings and began to furnish it as an Cabinet of curiosities. From an inventory list in the city archives it can be seen that they used as a model for their system of naming and presentation, the book \"Amboinsche Rariteitkamer\" by Georg Eberhard Rumphius. They shared the room with the Synod of the Dutch Reformed Church, that used it once every six years for its meetings. They hired a woman for the dusting and serving tea, and in 1768 they hired a man as curator, who was responsible for the entire collection and the medical \"Hortus\" garden in the yard.\n\nThe spacious room soon proved too small for the number of donated artifacts it received from its members, thanks to the increase in shipping and associated travel. In the late 18th century and early 19th century, Haarlem became a bedroom community of Amsterdam, with many wealthy bankers becoming members of the young Society. The old paintings became just a colorful backdrop for chests filled with stuffed animals and prepared specimens. In 1777 the Society moved its overflowing collection to a renovated house on the Grote Houtstraat, where the new young curator Martin van Marum would live the rest of his life. This building, situated next to the Mennonite church, was mortgaged with the Mennonite banker Pieter Teyler van der Hulst, who was not a member of the Society, but who created his own arts society and whose later testament would be the basis for the Teylers Museum, where van Marum would also become curator.\n\nThis move essentially split the collection, and the \"natural history half\" is currently in the collection of the Teylers Museum. Though the paintings and the garden remained back at city hall, 40 years after Carl Linnaeus had published his \"Systema Naturae\" no one was interested in the garden (which was set up as a living version of that book), and still fewer people were interested in the religious art. The city hall was seen as a depot of large pieces of historical importance, and the next large group of paintings to join the collection occurred when Napoleon disbanded the guilds in the Netherlands in 1794. The guilds' property reverted to the state. This is how the larger pieces that Hals painted for the guilds came into the collection. Without an official curator, the painting collection was only available to be seen by appointment with the city clerk, a situation that has remained up to the present day for the large pieces still located there, such as the whalebone from Willem Barentsz trip to Nova Zembla or the portrait of Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer.\n\nIn the mid-19th century the back cloisters were given an extra floor for additional showing space, and it was at this time that the museum opened its doors to the public via a separate entrance than the main city hall entrance. This was also the first time that all the group portraits could be shown hanging near each other. No works of modern art were bought at that time, and the decision to form the museum was to cater to the visitors of other Haarlem museums. At the time, modern art could be seen at the nearby Teylers Eerste Schilderijenzaal in Teylers Museum, and also in the gallery of the \"Museum voor Levende Nederlandsche Meesters\", otherwise known as the \"Haarlemsche Paviljoen\", a museum that was open from 1838 until 1885 in the former home of Henry Hope he called Villa Welgelegen. The art critic Victor de Stuers was very angry about Haarlem being the location of such museums, as there was no artistic climate there to speak of. He criticized the collection at the Paviljoen for lacking works by contemporary painters such as \"Israëls, Bosboom, Bles, Bisschop, van de Sande Bakhuijzen, Bakker Korff, and Alma Tadema\", and though works by these painters were already on view at Teylers at the time, the Frans Hals museum collection only has a few paintings by the first two in their collection today. Stuers also felt it was a scandal that the city fathers in charge of the municipal museum made no effort to stop the sale of a to the Brussels museum in 1872.\n\nThus this antiquated collection is the one that was transferred to the Groot Heiligland in 1913, and large pieces that were not in the cloisters at that time, such as the painting by Dirck Ferreris installed in the mayor's room, remained at city hall. A few of these were formally given to the museum in 1962, such as The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627 and The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1630. In 1962 when the museum celebrated its 100-year anniversary as a municipal collection, the collection had already been split again into a modern and a classical one, with the modern art housed in a new wing on the north side of the complex. Today the modern art is displayed in the Verweyhal. The museum celebrated its 100-year anniversary on the Groot Heiligland in 2013 with a Frans Hals exhibition that included reproductions being placed around the city in original locations.\n\nAside from several works by Hals and other artworks originally from the collections of many former guilds, monasteries and churches of Haarlem, the collection of over 750 works also includes objects relating to Haarlem that have been acquired by local donations and purchases. The museum is specialized in restoration and research on the works of Haarlem painters in the 17th century and of the painters of the 16th century who taught them to paint, most notably Jan van Scorel, Maerten van Heemskerck, Hendrick Goltzius and Cornelis van Haarlem. In the late 19th century the museum became something of a pilgrimage site for young impressionists, who were fascinated by the loose brushwork visible in the two group portraits of regents by Hals that he painted when he was in his eighties. This is the reason that after the move to the present location in 1913, the museum took on the name of Frans Hals as these were considered the most prominent paintings of the collection at the time. The museum is still famous for group portraits by Hals, but since the group portraits from the military guilds were cleaned in the early 20th century, it is these which most visitors come to see today. Most of the objects and paintings can not be displayed for lack of space, and the museum rotates its collection through exhibitions at various locations in Haarlem, though works by some prominent painters cannot be lent out and remain in storage.\n\nSeveral stately rooms saved from torn-down Haarlem houses have been partially reconstructed and a collection of Haarlem silver saved from various local churches can be seen in the former regent rooms of the almshouse, which now seem much grander than they were originally. The windows have been decorated with art by anonymous Haarlem glass artists, most of which has been acquired through municipal demolitions work. Spread along the corridors are beautiful Dutch tiles from local salvage operations that have been installed along the walls, accompanied by 17th century furniture including clocks, chairs, and chests.\n\nThe museum as an institution is only responsible for its collection, which is mostly oil paintings. Other applied art that has been installed is the responsibility of the municipal culture department, and the museum rents the premises from them. This is the reason that visitors are offered much more information about the paintings than about other aspects of the building, including the objects in the courtyard.\n\nBetween 1605 and 1635 over 100,000 paintings were produced in Haarlem. Not all of these have survived, and most have left town, but this does say something about the artistic climate in the city. At that time art ownership in the city was 25%, a record high. More art has survived up to today from that period in Haarlem than from any other Dutch city, thanks mostly to the \"Schilder-boeck\" published by Karel van Mander there in 1604. The former curator Pieter Biesboer has created inventories of Haarlem art and worked on several catalogues for the museum, mostly based on the works created before 1800.\n\nWhat follows is a list of the prominent painters through the centuries on display in the museum.\n\n\n\n"}

His ideas were largely dismissed during his working life, leading him to move into plant taxonomy, but found favour late in the twentieth century.\n\nGleason was born in Dalton City, Illinois, and after undergraduate and master's work at the University of Illinois earned a PhD from Columbia University in Biology in 1906. He held faculty positions at the University of Illinois, the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan, before returning to the East Coast, to the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, New York, where he remained for the rest of his career, until 1950.\n\nIn Gleason's early ecological research on the vegetation of Illinois, around 1909-1912, he worked largely within the theoretical structure endorsed by ecologist Frederic Clements, whose work on succession was the most influential during the first decades of the twentieth century. Building on Henry C. Cowles's landmark research at the Indiana Dunes and some of the ideas of his mentor Charles Bessey at the University of Nebraska, Clements had developed a theory of plant succession in which vegetation could be explained by reference to an ideal sequence of development called a sere. Clements sometimes compared the development of seres to the growth of individual organisms, and suggested that under the right circumstances, seres would culminate in the best adapted form of vegetation, which he called the climax state. In his early research, Gleason interpreted the vegetation of Illinois using Clementsian concepts like associations, climax states, pioneer species, and dominant species.\n\nHowever, in 1918, Gleason began to express significant doubts on the usefulness of some of Clements's widely employed vocabulary, especially the use of the organism metaphor to describe the growth of vegetation, and the treatment of the units of vegetation as including climaxes. (What units should be used in the analysis of vegetation was a widely disputed issue in early twentieth-century ecology.) In 1926, Gleason expressed even stronger objections to Clements's theory. First, he argued that Clements's identification of particular kinds of vegetation assumed too much homogeneity, since areas of vegetation are actually similar to one another only to degrees. Second, he argued that Clements's associating particular vegetation types with particular areas underestimated the real diversity of vegetation. These objections together cast doubt, for Gleason, on the \"integrity of the association concept\" itself—on identifying any grouping of species as amounting to a nameable association, like \"oak-maple association,\" as botanists and ecologists (including Gleason himself) normally had.\n\nAs an alternative to describing vegetation in terms of associations, Gleason offered \"the Individualistic concept of ecology,\" in which \"the phenomena of vegetation depend completely upon the phenomena of the individual\" species (1917), and plant associations are less structured than he thought Clements's theory maintained. At times, Gleason suggested that the distribution of plants approaches mathematical randomness.\n\nClements never responded in print to Gleason's objections and alternative models, and they were largely ignored until the 1950s, when research by a number of ecologists (particularly Robert Whittaker and John T. Curtis) supported Gleasonian models. Subsequently, 'species-individualistic' models have become prevalent in community ecology.\n\nFrustration due to dismissal of his ecological ideas without serious consideration may have contributed to Gleason's general abandonment of ecology. From the 1930s onward, he shifted the focus of his work to plant taxonomy, where he became an influential figure, working for many years at the New York Botanical garden, and authoring with Arthur Cronquist one of the authoritative floras of northeastern North America.\n\nGleason married Eleanor Theodolinda Mattei, the daughter of Swiss-American winemaker Andrew Mattei; they met on a steamship, where Gleason was on a botanical expedition, while Mattei was taking a grand tour of the world following her graduation from Mills College. Their elder son, Henry Allan Gleason Jr (1917–2007), was a linguist and Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto. Their second son, Andrew Gleason, (1921–2008), was a mathematician and Professor Emeritus at Harvard University.\n\n\n\"(many are available in Google Scholar as copyrights are long expired)\"\n\n\n"}

Doing so would constitute the unauthorized practice of law, which is a crime. Because of this, many organizations including the Central America Resource Center recommend that all persons seeking immigration assistance completely avoid notaries and immigration consultants and, instead, seek legal advice from a licensed attorney.\n\nMany governments have authorized bodies that provide licence to deserving immigration consultants who are thoroughly up-to-date about the visa and immigration rules of their country. Canada provides the certification through Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council, and Australia provides it through Migration Agents Registration Authority.\n\nImmigration consultants started working in the 1960s when a large number of qualified people have started migrating from Asia and Latin America to U.S.A., Canada and Europe.

Italian, Parma, 1782–1799) – \"Origen, progresos y estado actual de toda la literatura\" (Madrid, 1784–1806, but was incomplete as it did not include the part devoted to the ecclesiastical sciences) only recently restored to a critical and complete edition.\n\nHe was considered an extraordinarily intellectual figure in the Europe of his time, but was ignored for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This was for several reasons, as much\ncircumstantial as general interest. Andrés trained in the former University of Gandia, was a Professor of Rhetoric, and a young Jesuit forced into exile in Italy 1767. He first settled in Ferrara, and then the Marquis of Bianchi welcomed him to his palace in Mantua. Here, he enjoyed life with the Marquis's family, until the arrival of Napoleon, more than twenty years of happy and productive stay that allowed him to complete the major part of his work. In England it was studied and followed mostly by Henry Hallam.\n\nAndrés is also the author of, among many other titles, \"Family Letters, (Tour of Italy)\" (Madrid and Valencia, 1786–1800), the Spanish-language work is one of the most important of its kind and a major European piece, mainly composed of a literary-scientific and especially bibliographic journey. The thoughts of Andrés, settled in the late neoclassical Age of Enlightenment responds with a strong Spanish-Italian tradition not only identifiable with the big fellow Jesuits, victims of expulsion, most prominently Lorenzo Hervas, builder of comparative linguistics, and the great music theorist Antonio Eximeno together with whom were seen as the nucleus of the eighteenth century \"School of Spanish Universalists\", but further amplified the line represented by Ignacio de Luzan, Ludovico Antonio Muratori and the great pioneer and genius Giambattista Vico. Andrés, with his sight almost gone at the end of his life, spent his final professional occupation in charge of the Royal Library of Naples, to finally die in Rome in the protection of his religious congregation. The first and most important volume (given the main feelings of the sense of self and the critical nature of the new edition) of his major work was republished in Madrid in 1997, it was completed in 2002.\n"}

Research underpins both standardization activities and the information and recommendations provided to health authorities, the dental profession and the public. Projects include material characterization and properties, biocompatibility and clinical performance.\n\nNIOM provides evidence- and research-based information on dental biomaterials and medical devices to dental personnel, health authorities and to the public. This is promulgated through articles in the Nordic dental journals, journals for dental technicians, KDM-reports (Kunskapscenter för Dentala Material) and a continuous updating of the NIOM website. There is ongoing work on a register of dental products (\"DMN\" - Dentala Material Norden).\nNIOM also provides on-line services, E-mail and telephone, related to dental biomaterials.\n\nNIOM carries out testing according to relevant product standards and according to selected methods as requested by the client. TNIOM offers consulting services in questions related to dental biomaterials. Consultancies cover questions related to properties, performance, safety and development of dental biomaterials.\n\nNIOM has for many years contributed to standardization at an international level both through the International organization for Standardization - ISO and within Europe through the Comité Européen de Normalisation (CEN). Development of new standards and revision of existing standards have been the main focus. Standards in dentistry set requirements for the properties of dental materials and dental instrumentation, and prescribe procedures for the testing of dental materials. Participation in standardization work for dental products and for biocompatibility in general allows NIOM to have an influence on test methods and requirements for dental products. NIOM has had, and still has, a major impact on the selection of methodology and requirements of the dental product standards, and the requirements are often based on results from research activities at NIOM.\n\nInternational standardization is organized in different Technical Committees (TC), each dealing with a specific field of interest. Each committee is again divided into smaller subcommittees and working groups devoted to different topics of the field. Scientists from the institute are technical experts and conveners of working groups within the following technical committees: ISO/TC 106 Dentistry; ISO/TC 194 Biocompatibility of medical devices; CEN/TC 55 Dentistry, and CEN/TC 206 Biocompatibility of medical and dental materials and devices. Standards Norway (SN) is the national member body in the European and International standardization organizations.\n"}

The book advises on how to cook many things (e.g., for pasta use abundant water, avoid hard water, add salt and a little oil to water, use slightly acidic water, with reasons and the science behind everything) and includes a few historical recipes (e.g., Fish or Meat Jelly, by Taillevent in 1375,), but no modern recipes as such.\n\n"}
{"id": "45675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45675", "title": "Primary Chronicle", "text": "Primary Chronicle\n\nThe Tale of Bygone Years (, \"Pověstĭ Vremęnĭnyhŭ Lětŭ\") known in English-language historiography as the Primary Chronicle is a history of Kievan Rus' from about 850 to 1110, originally compiled in Kiev about 1113. The work is considered to be a fundamental source in the interpretation of the history of the Eastern Slavs.\n\nTradition long regarded the original compilation as the work of a monk named Nestor (c. 1056 – c. 1114); hence scholars spoke of \"Nestor's Chronicle\" or of \"Nestor's manuscript\". His compilation has not survived. Nestor's many sources included\nNestor worked at the court of Sviatopolk II of Kiev (ruled 1093–1113), and probably shared Sviatopolk's pro-Scandinavian policies.\n\nThe early part of the \"Chronicle\" features many anecdotal stories, among them \n\nThe account of the labors of Saints Cyril and Methodius among the Slavic peoples also makes a very interesting tale, and to Nestor we owe the story of the summary way in which Vladimir the Great (ruled 980 to 1015) suppressed the worship of Perun and other traditional gods at Kiev.\n\nIn the year 1116, Nestor's text was extensively edited by the hegumen Sylvester who appended his name at the end of the chronicle. As Vladimir Monomakh was the patron of the village of Vydubychi (now a neighborhood of Kiev) where Sylvester's monastery was situated, the new edition glorified Vladimir and made him the central figure of later narrative. This second version of Nestor's work is preserved in the Laurentian codex (see below).\n\nA third edition followed two years later and centered on the person of Vladimir's son and heir, Mstislav the Great. The author of this revision could have been Greek, for he corrected and updated much data on Byzantine affairs. This latest revision of Nestor's work is preserved in the Hypatian codex (see below).\n\nBecause the original of the chronicle as well as the earliest known copies are lost, it is difficult to establish the original content of the chronicle. The two main sources for the chronicle's text as it is known presently are the Laurentian Codex and the Hypatian Codex.\n\nThe Laurentian Codex was compiled in what are today Russian lands by the Nizhegorod monk Laurentius for the Prince Dmitry Konstantinovich in 1377. The original text he used was a codex (since lost) compiled for the Grand Duke Mikhail of Tver in 1305. The account continues until 1305, but the years 898–922, 1263–83 and 1288–94 are missing for reasons unknown. The manuscript was acquired by the famous Count Musin-Pushkin in 1792 and subsequently presented to the National Library of Russia in Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe Hypatian Codex dates to the 15th century. It was written in what are today Ukrainian lands and incorporates much information from the lost 12th-century Kievan and 13th-century Halychian chronicles. The language of this work is the East Slavic version of Church Slavonic language with many additional irregular east-slavisms (like other east-Slavic codices of the time). Whereas the Laurentian (Muscovite) text traces the Kievan legacy through to the Muscovite princes, the Hypatian text traces the Kievan legacy through the rulers of the Halych principality. The Hypatian codex was rediscovered in Kiev in the 1620s, and a copy was made for Prince Kostiantyn Ostrozhsky. A copy was found in Russia in the 18th century at the Ipatiev Monastery of Kostroma by the Russian historian Nikolai Karamzin.\n\nNumerous monographs and published versions of the chronicle have been made, the earliest known being in 1767. Aleksey Shakhmatov published a pioneering textological analysis of the narrative in 1908. Dmitry Likhachev and other Soviet scholars partly revisited his findings. Their versions attempted to reconstruct the pre-Nestorian chronicle, compiled at the court of Yaroslav the Wise in the mid-11th century.\n\nUnlike many other medieval chronicles written by European monks, the \"Tale of Bygone Years\" is unique as the only written testimony on the earliest history of East Slavic people. Its comprehensive account of the history of Rus' is unmatched in other sources, although important correctives are provided by the Novgorod First Chronicle. It is also valuable as a prime example of the Old East Slavonic literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

These riots saw Koreans gathering outside hospitals, schools and churches run by foreigners to rail against the 'baby-snatchers' inside. Many in the foreign community were alarmed by the ferocity of the riots and made preparations to leave Korea, and diplomatic representatives of the foreign legations pressed the Joseon government to repudiate the rumours, which they did reluctantly. While it was initially speculated that the Heungseon Daewongun instigated the incident in a manner similar to the Imo Incident, or the combination of Catholic zeal and local anti-Christian sentiment, many began to speculate that these rumours were deliberately spread by the order of Yuan Shikai, the ambassador and representative of the suzerain Qing dynasty in China, either to scare off foreign investment in Korea or provoke a military intervention.

{"id": "5660497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5660497", "title": "The Brave Little Tailor", "text": "The Brave Little Tailor\n\n\"The Brave Little Tailor\" or \"The Valiant Little Tailor\" or \"The Gallant Tailor\" (German: \"Das tapfere Schneiderlein\") is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, tale number 20. Joseph Jacobs collected another variant \"A Dozen at One Blow\" in \"European Folk and Fairy Tales\". Andrew Lang included it in \"The Blue Fairy Book\". Another of many versions of the tale appears in \"A Book of Giants\" by Ruth Manning-Sanders.\n\nIn the Aarne–Thompson–Uther system of classifying folktales, it is type 1640, with elements of several other story types.\n\nA tailor is preparing to eat some jam, but when flies settle on it, he kills seven of them with one blow of his hand. He makes a belt describing the deed, reading \"Seven at One Blow\". Inspired, he sets out into the world to seek his fortune. The tailor meets a giant who assumes that \"Seven at One Blow\" refers to seven men. The giant challenges the tailor. When the giant squeezes water from a boulder, the tailor squeezes milk, or whey, from cheese. The giant throws a rock far into the air, and it eventually lands. The tailor counters the feat by tossing a bird that flies away into the sky; the giant believes the small bird is a \"rock\" which is thrown so far that it never lands. Later, the giant asks the tailor to help him carry a tree. The tailor directs the giant to carry the trunk, while the tailor will carry the branches. Instead, the tailor climbs on, so the giant carries him as well, but it appears as if the tailor is supporting the branches.\n\nImpressed, the giant brings the tailor to the giant's home, where other giants live as well. During the night, the giant attempts to kill the tailor by bashing the bed. However, the tailor, having found the bed too large, had slept in the corner. Upon returning and seeing the tailor alive, the other giants flee in fear of the small man.\n\nThe tailor enters the royal service, but the other soldiers are afraid that he will lose his temper someday, and then seven of them might die with every blow. They tell the king that either the tailor leaves military service or they will. Afraid of being killed for sending him away, the king instead attempts to get rid of the tailor by sending him to defeat two giants along with a hundred horsemen, offering him half his kingdom and his daughter's hand in marriage if the tailor can kill the giants. By throwing rocks at the two giants while they sleep, the tailor provokes the pair into fighting each other until they kill each other, at which time the tailor stabbed the heart of the giants.\n\nThe king, surprised the tailor has succeeded, balks on his promise, and requires more of the tailor before he may claim his rewards. The king next sends him after a unicorn, another seemingly impossible task, but the tailor traps it by standing before a tree, so that when the unicorn charges, he steps aside and it drives its horn into the trunk. The king subsequently sends him after a wild boar, but the tailor traps it in a chapel with a similar luring technique.\n\nDuly impressed, the king relents, marries the tailor to the princess, and makes the tailor the ruler of half the original kingdom. The tailor's new wife hears him talking in his sleep and realizes with fury that he was merely a tailor and not a noble hero. Upon the princess's demands, the king promises to have him killed or carried off. A squire warns the tailor of the king's plan. While the kings servants are outside the door, the brave little tailor pretends to be talking in his sleep and says \"Boy, make the jacket for me, and patch the trousers, or I will hit you across your ears with a yardstick! I have struck down seven with one blow, killed two giants, led away a unicorn, and captured a wild boar, and I am supposed to be afraid of those who are standing just outside the bedroom!\" Terrified, the kings servants leave. The king does not try to assassinate the tailor again and so the tailor lives out his days as a king in his own right.\n\n\nIn the Aarne–Thompson–Uther system of folktale classification, the core of the story is motif type 1640, named The Brave Tailor for this story. It also include episodes of type 1060, Squeezing Water from a Stone; type 1062, A Contest in Throwing Stones; type 1052, A Contest in Carrying a Tree; type 1051, Springing with a Bent Tree; and type 1115, Attempting to Kill the Hero in His Bed.\n\nThe story features several more general themes common to numerous folktales and more formal literature:\n\n\"The Brave Little Tailor\" has close similarities to other folktales collected around Europe, including \"The Boy Who Had an Eating Match with a Troll\" (Norway) and \"Stan Bolovan\" (Romania). It also shares many elements with \"Jack the Giant Killer\" (Cornwall and England, with ties to \"Bluebeard\" folktales of Brittany, and earlier Arthurian stories of Wales), though the protagonist in that story uses his guile to actually kill giants. Both the Scandinavian and British variants feature a recurring stock character fairy-tale hero, respectively: Jack (also associated with other giant-related stories, such as \"Jack and the Beanstalk\"), and Askeladden, also known as Boots. It is also similar to the Greek myth of Hercules in which Hercules is promised the ability to become a god if he slays the monsters, much like the main character in \"The Brave Little Tailor\" is promised the ability to become king through marrying the king's daughter if he kills the beasts in the story.\n\nThe technique of tricking the later giants into fighting each other is identical to the technique used by Cadmus, in Greek mythology and a related surviving Greek folktale, to deal with the warriors who sprang up where he sowed dragon's teeth into the soil. In the 20th-century fantasy novel \"The Hobbit\", a similar strategy is also employed by the wizard Gandalf to keep three trolls fighting amongst themselves, until the rising sun turns them to stone.\n\n\n"}

In the mid-1980s, the three common versions of Unix were AT&T's System III, the basis of Microsoft's Xenix and the IBM-endorsed PC/IX, among others; AT&T's System V, which it sought to establish as the new Unix standard; and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). All were derived from AT&T's Research Unix, but had diverged considerably. Further, each vendor's version of Unix was different to some degree.\n\nFor example, at a mid-1980s Usenix conference, many AT&T staff had buttons which read \"System V: Consider it Standard\" and a number of major vendors were promoting products based on System V. On the other hand, System V did not yet have TCP/IP networking built in and BSD 4.2 did; vendors of engineering workstations were nearly all using BSD and posters that said \"4.2 > V\" were available.\n\nA group of vendors formed the X/Open standards group in 1984, with the aim of forming compatible open systems. They chose to base their system on Unix.\n\nX/Open caught AT&T's attention. To increase the uniformity of Unix, AT&T and leading BSD Unix vendor Sun Microsystems started work in 1987 on a unified system. (The feasibility of this had been demonstrated a few years earlier by the US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory's System V environment for BSD Unix.) This was eventually released as \"System V Release 4\" (SVR4).\n\nWhile this decision was applauded by customers and the trade press, certain other Unix licensees feared Sun would be unduly advantaged. They formed the Open Software Foundation (OSF) in 1988. The same year, AT&T and another group of licensees responded by forming UNIX International (UI). Technical issues soon took a back seat to vicious and public commercial competition between the two \"open\" versions of Unix, with X/Open holding the middle ground. A 1990 study of various Unix versions' reliability found that on each version, between a quarter and a third of operating system utilities could be made to crash by fuzzing; the researchers attributed this, in part, to the \"race for features, power, and performance\" resulting from BSD–System V rivalry, which left developers little time to worry about reliability.\n\nThe 1988 POSIX standard initially concentrated on system C library functions beyond what was included in the forthcoming C standard; later it expanded to specify other aspects of the system environment. POSIX specified a \"lowest common denominator\" that could be met by both System V and BSD-based variants, as well as some non-UNIX systems, with a reasonable amount of effort.\n\nIn March 1993, the major participants in UI and OSF formed the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) alliance, effectively marking the end of the most significant era of the Unix wars. In June, AT&T sold its UNIX assets to Novell, and in October Novell transferred the Unix brand to X/Open.\n\nIn 1996, X/Open and the new OSF merged to form the Open Group. COSE work such as the Single UNIX Specification, the current standard for branded Unix, is now the responsibility of the Open Group, which also controls the current POSIX standards.\n\nSince then, occasional bursts of Unix factionalism have broken out, such as the HP/SCO \"3DA\" alliance in 1995, and Project Monterey in 1998, a teaming of IBM, SCO, Sequent and Intel which was followed by litigation (SCO v. IBM) between IBM and the new SCO, formerly Caldera.\n\nBSD purged copyrighted AT&T code from 1989 to 1994. During this time various open-source BSD x86 derivatives took shape, starting with 386BSD, which was soon succeeded by FreeBSD and NetBSD. OpenBSD emerged in 1995 as a fork of NetBSD, DragonFly BSD as a fork from FreeBSD in 2003. Mac OS X v10.5 is the first operating system with open source BSD code to be certified as fully Unix compliant. BSD systems can claim direct ancestry from Version 7 Unix. Or, according to Open Source advocate Eric Raymond, BSD systems can be considered \"genetic Unix\", if not \"trademark Unix.\"\n\nDuring BSD's period of legal turmoil (1992–94), the nearly-complete GNU operating system was made operational by the inclusion of the Linux kernel and lumped together under the label \"Linux\". GNU had been written from scratch to avoid copyright issues. Linux systems broadly aim for compatibility with POSIX.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1546507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1546507", "title": "White marlin", "text": "White marlin\n\nWhite marlin (\"Kajikia albida\"), also known as Atlantic white marlin, marlin, skilligalee, is a species of billfish that lives in the epipelagic zone of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean. They are found between the latitudes of 45° N and 45° S in waters deeper than 100 m. Even though white marlin are found in bodies of water that are deeper than 100 m they tend to stay near the surface. White marlin have been found near banks, shoals, and canyons, but they are not limited to those locations. They prefer warm surface temperatures greater than 22 °C.\n\nWhite marlin are commonly misidentified as roundscale spearfish (\"Tetrapturus georgii\"). This likely caused a miscount of the population size of white marlin and roundscale spearfish before they were determined genetically different in 2001. Differentiation between the two species can be done with close external examination. As described in the name, roundscale spearfish have a broadband, round anterior end of their scales. White marlin scales are more rigid and rounded on the posterior region of the scale. Another way to identify between the two species without doing a genetic test is by looking at the distance between the anal opening and the anal fin. In roundscale spearfish, the anal opening is further way from the anal fin (greater than half the length of the anal fin) than it is in the white marlin.\n\nIn 1860, Felipe Poey gave the white marlin the name \"Tetrapturus albidus\". This classification places the species in the same genus as shortbill spearfish, Mediterranean spearfish, roundscale spearfish, and longbill spearfish. Researchers have identified fossils from the genus \"Tetrapturus\" dating back to the Langhian Age 15 million years ago (Mya). Extinct ancestors, such as species from the genus \"Palaeorhynchus\" date to as early as 56 Mya.\n\n\"Tetrapturus albidus\" was the accepted name for white marlin until 2006. At this time, Collette and his colleagues' genetic testing suggested that white marlin and Indo-Pacific striped marlin should be classified in the genus \"Kajikia\". Today, \"Kajikia albida\" and its close relative \"Kajikia audax\" (striped marlin) have been scientifically determined to be genetically distinct from the species in the genus \"Tetrapturus\".\n\nWhite marlin are mid-sized billfish with a bill that is round in cross section, and distinctly forked caudal fin. Their body structure is designed for fast swimming with a long, streamlined appearance. The length of \"K. albida\" is measured from the lower jaw to the fork of the tail (lower-jaw fork length; LJFL). The largest white marlin reported was 2.8 m (9.2 ft) LJFL and weighed over 82 kg (180.8 lb). The coloring of white marlin is used as countershading, with a dark blue dorsal side and a dirty white ventral side. Though all white marlin have the same coloring pattern, they are sexually dimorphic, with the females usually larger. One of the most noticeable features of white marlin is the dorsal fin, which extends along the majority of the dorsal portion of its body. The dorsal fin consists of typically 28 to 46 rays. These rays make up a fin tall and rounded in the anterior, but quickly levels off and then decreases as it extends to the posterior. Behind the large primary dorsal fin is the secondary dorsal fin, which is made up of five to six rays. White marlin have a set of similar pectoral fins and pelvic fins. These two sets of fin are rounded and wide at the tip. They also have two anal fins which can be used for identification between species. The lateral line on this species is prominent, with a hump above the pectoral fin and extends the length of the fish toward the caudal fin.\n\nInternally, white marlin do not have a swim bladder, but instead have small, bubble-shaped chambers that act as a swim bladder. Similarly to most vertebrates, they have symmetrical gonads. Unlike other marine fish, white marlin do not have gill rakers which are involved in suspension feeding. White marlin do have small but sharp teeth that are used when eating fish and cephalopods.\n\nWhite marlin are found throughout warmer waters of the Atlantic between 45°N to 45°S, it is found in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Mediterranean Sea, although records from the Mediterranean Sea and from as far north as Brittany, France, appear to refer to vagrants.\n\nWhite marlin are near the top of the food chain and will consume any prey they can find that is manageable for their size. Schooling flyingfish, small tuna, mahi-mahi (dolphinfish, dorado), and squid are the preferred prey of white marlin. They sometime forage for food with help of other predators. White marlin usually keep to themselves, but associate with other apex predators to increase the efficiency of foraging. They also obtain food is by diving down in a V- or U- shaped parabola to about 200 m in search of food that is not at the surface. To survive in these lower temperatures and darker environments, white marlin have larger eyes and a way to selectively warm their eye and brain tissue.\n\nThe lifecycle of \"K. albida\" begins with a large spawning in warm tropical waters near the equator. Each female can lay 190,000 to 586,000 eggs. The Gulf of Mexico, Mona Passage, Southwest Bermuda, and northwest Grand Bahama Island are a few locations that have been located as prime spawning ground for white marlin.They return to the warm, shallow, equatorial waters each year to spawn. Growth of white marlin is very rapid, with males reaching sexual maturity at only 153.2 cm LJFL and females becoming sexually mature at 189.9 cm LJFL. The lifespan of white marlin has been identified as 15 or more years.\n\nWhite marlin are ram ventilators, which means they have to be constantly moving to breathe. Many have made long transatlantic journeys. One white marlin resurfaced 6,517 km (4,083 miles) from where it was tagged 474 days later.\n\nPrior to 2001, roundscale spearfish and white marlin were identified as the same species. Researchers from Nova Southeastern University's Guy Harvey Research Institute, Dania Beach, Florida, first discovered that these two species were significantly different in 2001 through genetic tests. Before this discovery. the two species made up a population that was of least concern to the IUCN. Placement into the endangered species list was not established until 2007, when the population numbers had already dropped below easily recoverable levels.\n\nWhite marlin fishing is a multimillion-dollar organization in well-developed countries. Restrictions are in place to limit the size of fish that can be taken, but the angling process can be devastating to fish. The time spent on the hook, outside handling, dehooking, and releasing a white marlin exhaust enough energy that up to 32% of the time, the marlin cannot maintain buoyancy in the water. When fishing for any billfish, use of a circle hook, which can be dehooked more quickly than other hooks, is recommended. In the U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean waters, the fish is required by federal regulations to be kept in the water, boatside, to maximize its chances of surviving after release. Research indicates that removing a billfish from the water may increase their risk of death after release by ~30 percent (research ongoing).\n\nAbout 90% of the annual catch is caught accidentally in bycatch from fishing around the world. Many billfish are caught in gillnets or on longline hooks that were meant to catch other fish species. Since these hooks and nets are set for long periods of time, white marlin become food to sharks, pilot whales, and killer whales. In response to the decrease in white marlin, marine life agencies have developed acts and plans such as the Atlantic Tunas Conservation Act and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to protect vulnerable species. The U.S. Fishery Management plan for the Atlantic billfish has, as an objective, to educate and increase knowledge about billfish and their roles in the ecosystem. In the United States, billfishing is reserved for recreational fishing only.\n\nOcean City, Maryland, is known as the White Marlin Capital of the World. The city hosts the annual White Marlin Open, a big-game tournament which attracts anglers from all over the world, and which frequently pays out over a million dollars to the winning team. The tournament encourages tag-and-release (nonlethal) handling of the fish, although winning marlin are often brought back to the marina for verification of the size and weight. The 2010 White Marlin Open was held at Harbour Island Marina on 14th Street and the Bay.\n\nThe 2016 White Marlin Open created controversy when the only fish that met the minimum weight requirement of 70 lbs, was disqualified when the crew of the winning boat, \"Kallianassa\", was deemed to have failed a polygraph which implied that tournament rules were broken during the clash. The boat's owner, Phillip G. Heasley, was denied the $2.8 million of prize money.\n\nICCAT 2006. Report of the 2006 ICCAT Billfish stock assessment.

She also taught at the University of Toronto.\n\nWinifred Ellen Needler was born in Weimar, Germany, to Mary Winifred (Chisholm) Needler and George Henry Needler, a professor of German at the University of Toronto. She was known to family and friends as 'Friedel' or 'Friedl'. She was educated at St. Margaret's College and Oakwood Collegiate Institute, following which she got her B.A. in modern languages and philosophy at University College, Toronto. She then spent a year studying art at the Ontario College of Art. In 1928 she moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to study at the School of Fine Arts and Crafts, where she won a number of prizes for her artwork.\n\nFor five years Needler struggled to make a living as a commercial artist, but this eventually proved impossible during the Great Depression. In 1935, she got a job as a draftsperson and cataloguer at the Museum of Ontario Archaeology, drawing specimens for the museum's card system. She became increasingly interested in the Egyptian collection and began to concentrate on it. In 1938, she was awarded a Carnegie Fellowship that allowed her to take a leave of absence from the museum and study at Yale University. During her year at Yale, she studied with Michael Rostovtzeff, Cornelius Osgood, and Ludlow Bull. She could not stay to complete the two-year master's degree, although Rostovtzeff argued that a paper she wrote for him on Ptolemaic sculpture was so good that it should be accepted as a master's thesis. She received her M.A. in 1961 from the University of Toronto.\n\nOn her return to Canada in 1939, Needler undertook a systematic organization and classification of the museum's extensive collection of Near Eastern antiquities, many collected by then-director Charles Trick Currelly. After holding various positions in the museum, in 1951 she was appointed to a top curatorial post as keeper of the Near Eastern Collections. She helped to expand the museum's holdings of artefacts from the Near East. A decade later, when the museum decided to split the Near Eastern Collections in two, she was appointed curator of the half that was named the Egyptian Department.\n\nNeedler was able to do field work only intermittently. She spent the summers of 1941 and 1942 in field work at the old mission in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. Then in 1947 she had her first chance to do field work in Egypt, joining a team at the temple of Seti I at Abydos, where she worked alongside Amice Calverley to copy wall paintings and inscriptions. In 1956, she spent a month at Jericho, where Kathleen Kenyon was leading the excavations, drawing and recording newfound objects. In 1962–63 she spent time working with Walter Bryan Emery at Buhen in the Sudan and at Qasr Ibrim in Egypt, where archeological salvage work was under way in advance of the construction of Aswan Dam. Needler worked on excavating a cemetery, dismantling a temple built by Queen Hatshepsut, and making drawings of artifacts removed from the sites.\n\nIn 1943–44, Needler designed and painted a large frieze for the museum's Egyptian gallery that was wide and extended around three walls of the gallery. Populated with some five dozen figures and animals adapted from Egyptian tomb paintings, the mural aimed to capture the spirit and style of Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom art. The mural is no longer on public display but is preserved in the museum's archives.\n\nIn 1953, Needler was appointed a special lecturer in the Department of Fine Art at the \nUniversity of Toronto. After 12 years, she moved over to the Department of Near Eastern Studies as an associate professor and taught there until she retired in 1970.\n\nIn 1969, Needler was awarded a prestigious Wilbour Fellowship by the Brooklyn Museum, with the goal of publishing an account of that museum's collection of predynastic and archaic Egyptian art. Needler's research for this monograph occupied the years 1970 (when she retired from the Museum of Ontario Archaeology) to 1975. However, publication was delayed until 1984 because museum publication funds ran low and outside funding had to be secured. Needler's monograph is considered a valuable and original contribution to the study of Egyptian art and archeology.\n\nIn 1982, Bishop's University honored Needler with an honorary doctorate in recognition of her service to the Museum of Ontario Archaeology and to the field of Egyptology.\n\n"}
{"id": "2063195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2063195", "title": "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack Australia", "text": "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack Australia\n\nWisden Cricketers' Almanack Australia (also known as Wisden Australia) was a cricket annual and reference book, the Australian version of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", generally known as \"Wisden\". The Australian edition's gestation period was lengthy: the first edition appeared in 1998, when the Preface referred to a March 1981 report in \"The Australian\" announcing the imminent appearance of the Australian edition.\n\n\"Wisden Australia\" was published by Hardie Grant Publishing of Melbourne, at or near the beginning of the Australian season, in November or early December. In contrast to the yellow cover of the parent publication \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", its cover was predominantly bright green. The last two editions published, those of 2004-05 and 2005–06, emulated the parent by featuring dustjackets with photographs.\n\nThe Australian edition was also somewhat slimmer and cheaper, as there were fewer games to report on in Australia; in most other respects the format and content of the Australian edition were similar to those of the English version. One difference was that the former's coverage of first grade cricket in each state and territory was more comprehensive than the latter's relatively sketchy coverage of top level English club and league cricket.\n\nThe first two editions, dated 1998 and 1999, covered the 1997-98 and 1998-99 Australian seasons respectively. The numbering changed with the third edition, which adopted the practice of the English almanack by including in its title the date of the season immediately after the season covered. Thus the 2000-01 edition covered the 1999-2000 season, and so on up to the 2005-06 edition, the eighth in the series, published in 2005 which covered the domestic season 2004-05 and the 2005 Ashes tour in England.\n\nNo further edition has been published since 2005. The most comprehensive reviews and records of Australian cricket are now to be found online or in the reports of the various state cricket associations. The website of Cricket Australia, the national body, does not cover grade cricket in any detail.\n\n"}
