Each contact entry usually consists of a few standard fields (for example: first name, last name, company name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, fax number, mobile phone number). Most such systems store the details in alphabetical order of people's names, although in paper-based address books entries can easily end up out of order as the owner inserts details of more individuals or as people move. Many address books use small ring binders that allow adding, removing and shuffling of pages to make room.\n\nA related term that has entered the popular lexicon is little black book (or simply black book). Such books are used as dating guides, listing people who the owner has dated in the past or hopes to in the future, and details of their various relationships. More explicit variations are guides for sexual partners. It is unclear how prevalent this is in practice or when it originated, though such books have been mentioned in many pieces of popular culture. For example, the 1953 film version of \"Kiss Me, Kate\" features a musical scene in which Howard Keel's character laments the loss of the social life he enjoyed before marriage, naming numerous female romantic encounters while perusing a miniature black book. More recently, the mid-2000s Guinness Brewmasters advertising campaign features the \"little black book\" as an invention of one of the brewmasters.\n\nAddress books can also appear as software designed for this purpose, such as the \"Address Book\" application included with Apple Inc.'s Mac OS X. Simple address books have been incorporated into e-mail software for many years, though more advanced versions have emerged in the 1990s and beyond; and also in mobile phones.\n\nA personal information manager (PIM) integrates an address book, calendar, task list, and sometimes other features.\n\nEntries can be imported and exported from the software in order to transfer them between programs or computers. The common file formats for these operations are:\n\nIndividual entries are frequently transferred as vCards (*.vcf), which are roughly comparable to physical business cards. And some software applications like Lotus Notes and Open Contacts can handle a vCard file containing multiple vCard records.\n\nAn online address book typically enables users to create their own web page (or profile page) which is then indexed by search engines like Google and Yahoo. This in turn enables users to be found by other people via a search of their name and then contacted via their web page containing their personal information. Ability to find people registered with online address books via search engine searches usually varies according to the commonness of the name and the amount of results for the name. Typically users of such systems can synchronize their contact details with other users that they know to ensure that their contact information is kept up to date.\n\nMany people have many different address books: their email accounts, their mobile phone, and the \"friends lists\" on their social networking services. A network address book allows them to organize and manage their address books through one interface and share their contacts across their different address books and social networks\n\n"}

Anti-Western sentiment occurs in many countries, even from the West itself – especially European countries. Broad anti-Western sentiment also exists in the Muslim world against Europeans and the United States. The hatred against the United States stems from their support for Israel, the seizure of Iraq and the numerous sanctions on Iran. \n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Samuel P. Huntington argued that international conflict over economic ideology will be replaced with conflict over cultural differences. He argues that economic and political regionalism will increasingly shift non-Western countries towards geopolitical engagement with countries that share their values. Huntington argues that the Islamic world experiencing a population explosion at the same time as a growth in Islamic fanaticism, leading to rejection of Westernization.\n\nAfrica is often the posterchild for post-colonial societal collapse where retreating empires and corporate wars for resources have left behind nations unable to maintain their current trajectory of development or even their current state of affairs. Many conflicts currently playing out in Africa, similar to the Middle East, are often blamed on the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Germany, and the United States for arbitrary borders drawn with little regard to the ethnicity, tribal affiliation, and religions of the original inhabitants.\n\nAnti-Western sentiment in China has been increasing since the early 1990s, particularly amongst the Chinese youth. Notable incidents which have resulted in a significant anti-Western backlash have included the 1999 NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, the 2008 demonstrations during the Olympic torch relay and alleged Western media bias, especially in relation to the March 2008 Tibet riots. Whilst available public opinion polls show that the Chinese hold generally favourable views towards the United States, there remains suspicion over the West's motives towards China stemming largely from historical experiences and specifically the 'century of humiliation'. These suspicions have been increased by the Communist Party's \"Patriotic Education Campaign\".\n\nThere is a history of criticism of the so-called West within the history of thinking within the culture of Japan.\n\nLee Kuan Yew, the former Prime Minister of Singapore, argues that East Asian countries such as China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam should be based on \"Asian values\". Countries such as the Four Asian Tigers should aspire to have Western-style standards of living, but without accepting liberal democratic social institutions and principles.\n\nIn Amsterdam's secondary schools, about half the students of Moroccan descent do not identify with the Netherlands: they see their identity as 'Muslim', and regularly express anti-Western views but, nevertheless, do not want to return to their ancestral homeland.\n\nAfter the Cold War, a number of politicians in the Russian Federation have supported an explicit promotion of Russian Orthodox traditionalism, and a rejection of Western liberalism.\n\nSome ultra-nationalist politicians, such as Vladimir Zhirinovsky, an anti-communist, express the most anti-Western sentiment.\n\nVladimir Putin has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. Putin has attacked globalism and neo-liberalism, and promoted new think tanks that stress Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness, and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies. Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012 stating Putin's terms were like \"a miracle of God.\" The Russian Orthodox Church sometimes is host to groups that promote nationalist and anti-Western tendencies.\n\nThe Russian government has restricted foreign funding of some pro-liberal Non Governmental Organizations. Pro-Russian activists in the former Soviet Union frequently equate the West with homosexuality and the gay agenda, and Russian gay propaganda law was welcomed by nationalist and religious political figures in Russia as a bulwark against Western influence.\n\nThe Yarovaya Law prohibits evangelism by religious minorities, which was used to ban the U.S.-based Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nTerrorist groups Al-Qaeda and ISIS are both anti-western, and promote terrorism in Western countries.\n\n\"America thinks of modernity as all good — and it has been almost all good for America.  But for the Arab world, modernity has been one failure after another. Each path followed — socialism, secularism, nationalism — has turned into a dead end.”\n\nDuring the Ottoman period of Turkey a tradition of anti-Western idea commenced development.\n\n"}

It was subsequently profiled at the joint national conference of Museums Australia and Interpretation Australia in Perth in 2011. Its online content also resulted in Carnamah being featured at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra.\n\nThe society is an institutional member of Museums Australia, an affiliate of the Royal Western Australian Historical Society (RWAHS) and was the first Australian listing with the Society for One-Place Studies. At the RWAHS State History Conference in 2010 it was the recipient of the inaugural Affiliated Societies Merit Award for being a \"dynamic, but very different society\".\n\nThe society was the 2015 winner for contribution by a community-based organisation in the Western Australian Heritage Awards, which are conducted annually by the Heritage Council of Western Australia. The award citation attributed the society with using \"cutting-edge technology to engage with and promote the heritage of, not only their own and neighbouring districts, but also the State\".\n\nIn 1992 the society established the Carnamah Museum near the centre of the Carnamah townsite. The museum contains a diverse collection of objects, tools, machinery, photographs and ephemera relating to Carnamah’s social, domestic, commercial and agricultural past.\n\nIn 2010 the society received a grant of $171,500 from Lotterywest to finance the extension of its museum. Additional financial and in-kind contributions were received from various sources including the Royalties for Regions Regional Grants Scheme and the Shire of Carnamah. The extension included the installation of a \"Window to the Past\" where an enlarged historic photograph of Carnamah's main street was fitted into an old window cavity (creating the illusion of looking through the window and into the past). The extended museum was officially opened on 15 September 2012 by Grant Woodhams, M.L.A. for Moore.\n\nThe society also cares for the Macpherson Homestead, located about one kilometre east of the Carnamah townsite. The stone homestead was built in the late 1860s and following deterioration was restored with locally raised funds and grants from Lotterywest. The homestead is permanently on the State Register of Heritage Places. The Heritage Council of Western Australia noted that \"early settlers played an important and successful role in the development and growth of the Carnamah district\" and that \"the place has particular structural interest, with its high walls and steeply pitched roof and bush rafters\".\n\nThe society began a website in 2003 and meets many of its organisational objectives online. While its museum collection relates primarily to the Carnamah district, the society has taken a more regional approach online which has been attributed with putting Carnamah into better historical context.\n\nOnline content includes an expansive biographical dictionary, virtual museum, historical photographs, cemetery records, local histories and Australian Curriculum resources. On the recommendation of the State Library of Western Australia the society's website has been periodically archived for posterity since 2004 under the Preserving and Accessing Networked Documentary Resources of Australia (PANDORA) program.\n\nIn January 2010 the society entered the realm of social media by joining Facebook. It has also joined and attracted a following on Twitter, Flickr, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram and LinkedIn. The society uses social media to engage and interact with online followers about Carnamah's history, its museum and online content. As a result of exposure on social media the society and its activities were profiled in a two-page spread in the Nov-Dec 2011 issue of \"Inside History\" magazine and in the spring 2011 edition of \"Musing\", the publication of Museums Australia WA.\n\nThe society was invited to contribute as a guest author to the blog of Collections Australia Network (CAN). The invitation was accepted however CAN ceased its operations a few weeks after four posts had been written. The society instead started its own blog in May 2011 and began blogging on a regular basis after publishing the posts intended for CAN. Blog posts cover a broad range of topics including museum happenings, website additions, historical pieces and featured photographs. The society's blog was named in \"Inside History\" magazine's Top 50 Blogs in 2012 and 2014 and contributed to \"The Busy Archivist's Blogging Tool Kit\" in 2012 by providing insight into blogging and how it can be used by small archives and societies.\n\nThe society, in collaboration with the North Midlands Project, produces the online \"Biographical Dictionary of Coorow, Carnamah and Three Springs\". The dictionary contains referenced biographical and local information on thousands of people with a connection to the shires of Coorow, Carnamah or Three Springs. It is a merged and improved version of the society’s former Coorow-Waddy, Carnamah-Winchester and Three Springs databases.\n\nThe rationale behind this model is to tell the history of the district \"one person at a time\".\n\nThe society added a virtual museum to its website in August 2011 to share its collection with a broader audience. It began with three virtual exhibitions, but was later expanded to a total of nine with support from the Department of Culture and the Arts (DCA). An image from Carnamah's virtual museum was the cover of the July–August 2013 edition of \"Inside History\" magazine. In 2013 the society began rolling out Australian Curriculum resources to accompany its virtual exhibitions with backing from the Western Australian History Foundation and DCA.\n\nIn May 2014 the society's \"Virtual Museum: to be known and distinguished as Carnamah\" was the Level 1 winner of the Permanent Exhibition category at the Museums and Galleries National Awards (MAGNA), which are conducted annually by Museums Australia. The MAGNA judges summarised the work as an innovative solution that was \"very creative with excellent production values and interpretative images and narratives\". The following year, in 2015, the accompanying education resources received a Highly Commended in the Level 1 Interpretation, Learning and Audience Engagement category of the same awards. The judges commented that they were \"beautifully designed and comprehensive\" and were \"an exemplar for all local historical society/museums\".\n\nTo commemorate the centenary of the Gallipoli landings, the society created an additional virtual exhibition on the First World War in 2015.\n\nIn May 2012 the society launched a virtual volunteering pilot to index electoral rolls, with the work contributing to its databases. \"The aims of the program are to increase the output of the society, improve social inclusion and provide additional volunteering opportunities.\" In January 2013 the society received a $100,000 social innovation grant from the Government of Western Australia for the further development of its program. The funding, over a two-year period, covered research, development, trials, refinement and the sharing of structure and outcomes with other community sector organisations.\n\nThe society received a Highly Commended for Virtual Volunteering in the Innovation category of the 2015 Museums and Galleries National Awards. It was hailed as a \"great socially inclusive project which addresses the needs of both the museum and the volunteer\".\n\nAs part of the Australian Bicentenary in 1988, the society published \"Westward to the Sea: Reminiscences & History of the Carnamah District 1861-1987\". The book was compiled and written by P. R. Heydon, O.A.M.\n\nIn 2013 the society was a partner with Rail Heritage WA in gathering and providing content for the book \"Memories of the Midland Railway Co. of Western Australia\". The book, written by Philippa Rogers, was launched in 2014 to commemorate 50 years since the railway was taken over by Western Australian Government Railways.\n\nOne of the notable derivatives from the society's work is Carnamah's inclusion in the permanent exhibition \"Landmarks: People and Places across Australia\" at the National Museum of Australia (NMA) in Canberra. A curator at the NMA wanted to include Carnamah after discovering the society's website from an internet search on soldier settlement. Within one of the ten themes, \"Extending the Farmlands\", is Carnamah's First World War soldier settlement. The section, with accompanying objects, includes the stories of five soldier settlers and their families with interpretative detail being largely sourced from the Carnamah-Winchester Database on the society's website. In 2013 the NMA published a book on the exhibition, titled \"Landmarks: A History of Australia in 33 Places\", with Carnamah being featured as one of the 33.\n\n"}

As of September 20, 2007, it is on UNESCO's Memory of the World list.\n\nThe codex, written at the end or even in the middle of the 10th century, contains a menaion for the month of March, intersecting with the movable cycle of Easter. It also contains 24 lives of saints, 23 homilies and one prayer, most of which were written by or are attributed to John Chrysostom. The 284-folio (or 285-folio, according to some sources) codex was \"discovered\" in 1823 by Canon Michał Bobrowski in the Uniate Basilian monastery in Supraśl. \n\nIn 1838, Bobrowski sent the last part of the manuscript in two pieces to Slovene philologist Jernej Kopitar so that he could transcribe it. After Kopitar returned it, Bobrowski sent him the first part (118 folios), however for unknown reason it was never returned to Bobrowski and was found in 1845 among the documents of the deceased Kopitar. It was later kept by the Ljubljana Lyceum and now by the National and University Library of Slovenia in Ljubljana. \n\nThe largest part was bought for the private library of the Zamoyski family in Warsaw. This part of the codex disappeared during World War II, but later resurfaced in the United States and was returned by Herbert Moeller to Poland in 1968, where it has been held by the National Library of Poland in Warsaw until the present day. The third part, consisting of 16 folios, is held by the Russian National Library in Saint Petersburg.\n\nThe codex was published by Fran Miklošič (Vienna, 1851), Sergej Severjanov (\"Suprasalьskaja rukopisь\", Saint Petersburg, 1904), and Jordan Zaimov and Mario Capaldo (Sophia, 1982–1983). Alfons Margulies produced a significant volume on the codex titled \"Der altkirchenslavische Codex Suprasliensis\" (Heidelberg, 1927).\n\nFolio 260 of the manuscript contains the note \"g(ospod)i pomilui retъka amin\". Some experts think retъka represents the name of a scribe (hence the occasional name \"Codex of Retko\") and that the text was copied from several sources. Research indicates that at least one of the sources may have Glagolitic (for Epiphanius' \"Homily on the Entombment\"). Vocalizations of yers, rarely occurring epenthesis, change of \"ъ\" to \"ь\" behind hardened \"č\", \"ž\", \"š\" and some other linguistic traits point to its Bulgarian linguistic provenance.\n\n\n\n"}

An introduction to colors is also provided to support the main discussion.\n\nFirst, \"color\" refers to the human brain's subjective interpretation of combinations of a narrow band of wavelengths of light. For this reason, the definition of \"color\" is not based on a strict set of physical phenomena. Therefore, even basic concepts like \"primary colors\" are not clearly defined. For example, traditional \"Painter's Colors\" use red, blue, and yellow as the primary colors, \"Printer's Colors\" use cyan, yellow, and magenta, and \"Light Colors\" use red, green, and blue. \"Light colors\", more formally known as additive colors, are formed by combining red, green, and blue light. This article refers to additive colors and refers to red, green, and blue as the primary colors.\n\nHue is a term describing a pure color, that is, a color not modified by tinting or shading (see below). In additive colors, hues are formed by combining two primary colors. When two primary colors are combined in equal intensities, the result is a \"secondary color\".\n\nA color wheel is a tool that provides a visual representation of the relationships between all possible hues. The primary colors are arranged around a circle at equal (120 degree) intervals. (Warning: Color wheels frequently depict \"Painter's Colors\" primary colors, which leads to a different set of hues than additive colors.) The illustration shows a simple color wheel based on the additive colors. Note that the position (top, right) of the starting color, typically red, is arbitrary, as is the order of green and blue (clockwise, counter-clockwise). The illustration also shows the secondary colors, yellow, cyan, and magenta, located halfway between (60 degrees) the primary colors.\n\nThe complement of a hue is the hue that is opposite it (180 degrees) on the color wheel. Using additive colors, mixing a hue and its complement in equal amounts produces white.\n\nThe following discussion uses an illustration involving three projectors pointing to the same spot on a screen. Each projector is capable of generating one hue. The \"intensities\" of each projector are \"matched\" and can be equally adjusted from zero to full. (Note: \"Intensity\" is used here in the same sense as the RGB color model. The subject of matching, or \"gamma correction\", is beyond the level of this article.)\n\nA \"shade\" is produced by \"dimming\" a hue. Painters refer to this as \"adding black\". In our illustration, one projector is set to full intensity, a second is set to some intensity between zero and full, and third is set to zero. \"Dimming\" is accomplished by decreasing each projector's intensity setting to the same fraction of its start setting.\n\nIn the shade example, with any fully shaded hue, that all three projectors are set to zero intensity, resulting in black.\n\nA \"tint\" is produced by \"lightening\" a hue. Painters refer to this as \"adding white\". In our illustration, one projector is set to full intensity, a second is set to some intensity between zero and full, and third is set to zero. \"Lightening\" is accomplished by increasing each projector's intensity setting by the same fraction from its start setting to full.\n\nIn the tinting example, note that the third projector is now contributing. When the hue is fully lightened, all three projectors are each at full intensity, and the result is white.\n\nNote an attribute of the total intensity in the additive model. If full intensity for one projector is 1, then a primary color has a combined intensity of 1. A secondary color has a total intensity of 2. White has a total intensity of 3. Tinting, or \"adding white\", increases the total intensity of the hue. While this is simply a fact, the HSL model will take this fact into account in its design.\n\n\"Tone\" is a general term, typically used by painters, to refer to the effects of reducing the \"colorfulness\" of a hue.; painters refer to it as \"adding gray\". Note that gray is not a color or even a single concept but refers to all the range of values between black and white where all three primary colors are equally represented. The general term is provided as more specific terms have conflicting definitions in different color models. Thus, shading takes a hue toward black, tinting takes a hue towards white, and tones cover the range between.\n\nNo one color model is necessarily \"better\" than another. Typically, the choice of a color model is dictated by external factors, such as a graphics tool or the need to specify colors according to the CSS2 or CSS3 standard. The following discussion only describes how the models function, centered on the concepts of hue, shade, tint, and tone.\n\nThe RGB model's approach to colors is important because:\n\nIn the RGB model, hues are represented by specifying one color as full intensity (255), a second color with a variable intensity, and the third color with no intensity (0).\n\nThe following provides some examples using red as the full-intensity and green as the partial-intensity colors; blue is always zero:\nShades are created by multiplying the intensity of each primary color by 1 minus the shade factor, in the range 0 to 1. A shade factor of 0 does nothing to the hue, a shade factor of 1 produces black:\n\nThe following provides examples using orange:\nTints are created by modifying each primary color as follows: the intensity is increased so that the \"difference\" between the intensity and full intensity (255) is \"decreased\" by the tint factor, in the range 0 to 1. A tint factor of 0 does nothing, a tint factor of 1 produces white: \n\nThe following provides examples using orange:\nTones are created by applying both a shade and a tint. The order in which the two operations are performed does not matter, with the following restriction: when a tint operation is performed on a shade, the intensity of the dominant color becomes the \"full intensity\"; that is, the intensity value of the dominant color must be used in place of 255.\n\nThe following provides examples using orange:\nThe HSV, or HSB, model describes colors in terms of hue, saturation, and value (brightness). Note that the range of values for each attribute is arbitrarily defined by various tools or standards. Be sure to determine the value ranges before attempting to interpret a value.\n\nHue corresponds directly to the concept of hue in the Color Basics section. The advantages of using hue are\n\nSaturation corresponds directly to the concept of tint in the Color Basics section, except that full saturation produces no tint, while zero saturation produces white, a shade of gray, or black.\n\nValue corresponds directly to the concept of intensity in the Color Basics section.\nThe advantage of HSV is that each of its attributes corresponds directly to the basic color concepts, which makes it conceptually simple. The perceived disadvantage of HSV is that the saturation attribute corresponds to tinting, so desaturated colors have increasing total intensity. For this reason, the CSS3 standard plans to support RGB and HSL but not HSV.\n\nThe HSL model describes colors in terms of hue, saturation, and lightness (also called luminance). (Note: the definition of saturation in HSL is substantially different from HSV, and lightness is not intensity.) The model has two prominent properties:\nThe properties mentioned above have led to the wide use of HSL, in particular, in the CSS3 color model.\n\nAs in HSV, hue corresponds directly to the concept of hue in the Color Basics section. The advantages of using hue are\n\nLightness combines the concepts of shading and tinting from the Color Basics section. Assuming full saturation, lightness is neutral at the midpoint value, for example 50%, and the hue displays unaltered. As lightness decreases below the midpoint, it has the effect of shading. Zero lightness produces black. As the value increases above 50%, it has the effect of tinting, and full lightness produces white.\n\nAt zero saturation, lightness controls the resulting shade of gray. A value of zero still produces black, and full lightness still produces white. The midpoint value results in the \"middle\" shade of gray, with an RGB value of (128,128,128).\n\nSaturation, or the lack of it, produces tones of the reference hue that converge on the zero-saturation shade of gray, which is determined by the lightness.

A transcription/description of the text - called \"Computus Runicus\" - was published in 1626 by the Danish physician and antiquarian Ole Worm (Olaus Wormius). \n\nThe text consists of the 12 calendar pages and a series of additional pages with detailed explanations for finding information used in the medieval computus, including golden numbers and epacts.\n\nThe calendar is written in medieval runes with a gloss in Latin and some places also in Swedish added by Worm. It follows a standard layout for a Medieval calendar similar to those found in a book of hours, with Christian feasts and saint's days. Worm attempted to identify some of the unusual symbols found in the calendar, including one marking fast days and another marking the beginning of the Zodiac months which curiously start on the 18th day of each month instead of the more common 20th or 21st.\n\nAs with any medieval calendar, there is a column for the golden numbers used in the Metonic cycle (to find the date of Easter) and another column for the dominical letters (to find the date of Sunday each week). January 31st and the month of February have an additional column to be used for finding the beginning of Lent, while March and April have an additional column to assist with finding the date of Easter. The author used a similar system of rune replacements for the Latin letters and Roman numerals as those commonly found in other runic calendars, including the use of the extra runes Arlaug, Tvimadur, and Belgthor to represent the Golden Numbers 17, 18, and 19.\n\nOnline facsimile of original text: http://www.arild-hauge.com/computus_runicus.htm\n"}

Testing is often either logical testing or physical testing. The test procedures may involve other criteria from mathematical testing or chemical testing. Beyond simple conformance, other requirements for efficiency, interoperability or compliance may apply. Conformance testing is performed by an accredited independent organization, which can sometimes be the author of the standard (UL, FM for example). When testing is accompanied by Certification, the products or services may then be advertised as being certified in compliance with the referred technical standard. Manufacturers and suppliers of products and services rely on such certification including listing on the certification body's website, to assure quality to the end user and that competing suppliers are on the same level.\n\nAside from the various types of testing, related conformance testing activities include:\n\n\nConformance testing is applied in various industries where a product or service must meet specific quality and/or regulatory standards. This includes areas such as:\n\n\nIn all such testing, the subject of test is not just the formal conformance in aspects of completeness of filed proofs, validity of referred certificates, and qualification of operating staff. Rather, it also heavily focuses on operational conditions, physical conditions, and applied test environments. By extension conformance testing leads to a vast set of documents and files that allow for reiterating all performed tests.\n\nIn software testing, conformance testing verifies that a product performs according to its specified standards. Compilers, for instance, are extensively tested to determine whether they meet the recognized standard for that language.\n\nIn electronic engineering and electrical engineering, some countries and business environments (such as telecommunication companies) require that an electronic product meet certain requirements before they can be sold. Standards for telecommunication products written by standards organizations such as ANSI, the FCC, and IEC have certain criteria that a product must meet before compliance is recognized. In countries such as Japan, China, Korea, and some parts of Europe, products cannot be sold unless they are known to meet those requirements specified in the standards. Usually, manufacturers set their own requirements to ensure product quality, sometimes with levels much higher than what the governing bodies require. Compliance is realized after a product passes a series of tests without occurring some specified mode of failure.\n\nCompliance testing for electronic devices include emissions tests, immunity tests, and safety tests. Emissions tests ensure that a product will not emit harmful electromagnetic interference in communication and power lines. Immunity tests ensure that a product is immune to common electrical signals and electromagnetic interference (EMI) that will be found in its operating environment, such as electromagnetic radiation from a local radio station or interference from nearby products. Safety tests ensure that a product will not create a safety risk from situations such as a failed or shorted power supply, blocked cooling vent, and powerline voltage spikes and dips.\n\nFor example, Ericsson's telecommunications research and development subsidiary Telcordia Technologies publishes conformance standards for telecommunication equipment to pass the following tests:\n\n\nSeveral international standards relating to conformance testing are published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and covered in the divisions of ICS 03.120.20 for management and ICS 23.040.01 for technical. Other standalone ISO standards include:\n\n\nMany countries sign mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) with other countries in order to promote trade of and facilitate market access to goods and services, while making it easier to meet a country's conformance testing requirements. Additionally, these agreements have the advantage of increasing confidence in conformance assessment bodies (e.g., testing labs and certification bodies), and by extension, product quality.\n\n"}

Those who finish as runners-up in the vote receive the \"Silver Ball\" and \"Bronze Ball\" awards as the second and third most outstanding players in the tournament respectively. The current award was introduced in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, sponsored by Adidas and \"France Football\", though fifa.com also lists in their player articles as \"golden ball winners\" Kempes, Cruyff, Pelé, Bobby Charlton, Garrincha and Didi for 1978, 1974, 1970, 1966, 1962 and 1958 respectively. Barcelona is the only club whose players have won the Golden Ball a record 3 times (Johan Cruyff in 1974, Romário in 1994, Lionel Messi in 2014).\n\nThe \"Golden Boot\" or \"Golden Shoe\" Award goes to the top goalscorer of the FIFA World Cup. While every World Cup had a ranking of the goalscorers, the first time an award was given was in 1982, under the name Golden Shoe. It was rechristened Golden Boot in 2010. FIFA sometimes lists the top goalscorers of previous Cups among the Golden Boot winners.\n\nIf there is more than one player with the same number of goals, since 1994 the tie-breaker goes to the player without a penalty goal, if none has a penalty then the tie breaker goes to the person with more assists - with the FIFA Technical Study Group deciding whether an assist is to be counted as such. If there is still more than one player, the tie-breaker since 2006 goes to the player who has played the least amount of time, which translates to a higher goal average.\n\nThe \"Golden Glove Award\" is awarded to the best goalkeeper of the tournament. The award was introduced with the name \"Lev Yashin Award\" in 1994, in honor of the late Soviet goalkeeper. The FIFA Technical Study Group recognises the top goalkeeper of the tournament based on the player's performance throughout the final competition. Although goalkeepers have this specific award for their position, they are still eligible for the Golden Ball as well, as when Oliver Kahn was awarded in 2002. In the event of a tie, the Golden Glove Award goes to the goalkeeper who progressed furthest in the competition. The next tiebreakers are saves made, then minutes played.\n\nAlthough the Golden Glove Award was first awarded in 1994, every All-Star Team in World Cups prior to 1998 except 1990 included only one goalkeeper. \n\nThe \"Best Young Player\" award was awarded for the first time at the 2006 World Cup in Germany and given to Germany's Lukas Podolski. The award is given to the best player in the tournament who is at most 21 years old. For the 2018 World Cup, this meant that the player had to have been born on or after 1 January 1997. The election took place on FIFA's official World Cup website with the help of The FIFA Technical Study Group.\n\nFIFA organised a survey on the Internet for users to choose the \"best young player\" of the World Cup, between 1958 and 2002, named the best young player of each tournament. With 61% of the overall vote, the winner was Pelé, who finished ahead of the Peruvian Teófilo Cubillas, the best young player at Mexico 1970, and England's Michael Owen, who reached similar heights at France 98.\n\nThe \"FIFA Fair Play Trophy\" is given to the team with the best record of fair play during the World Cup final tournament since 1970. Only teams that qualified for the second round are considered. The winners of this award earn the FIFA Fair Play Trophy, a diploma, a fair play medal for each player and official, and $50,000 worth of football equipment to be used for youth development.\n\nThe appearance of the award was originally a certificate. From 1982 to 1990, it had been a golden trophy based on Sport Billy, a football-playing cartoon character from 1982 who became an icon for FIFA Fair play. Ever since 1994, it is simply a trophy with an elegant footballer figure. Peru was the first nation to win the award after receiving no yellow or red cards in the 1970 FIFA World Cup held in Mexico.\n\nThe \"Man of the Match\" award picks the outstanding player in every game of the tournament since 2002. While the inaugural two editions were chosen by the technical group, the Man of the Match is since 2010 picked by an online poll on FIFA's website.\n\nTotal awards<br>\"As of 15 July 2018\"\nBy Country\"As of 15 July 2018\"\nThe FIFA Award for the \"Most Entertaining Team\" is a subjectively awarded prize for the team that had done the most to entertain the public with a positive approach to the game, organised through public participation in a poll starting in 1994.\n\nThe \"All-Star Team\" is a team of the best performers at the respective World Cup finals. The ways in which the FIFA All-Star team members have been chosen has varied from year to year. A technical study group consisting of journalists - mostly from Europe and South America - and experts has historically chosen the team. However, in 1994 FIFA decided to add an official squad, chosen by the FIFA technical group and under the brand name \"MasterCard All-Star Team\". For 1998, 2002 and 2006, substitute and reserve members were also nominated for full 22 and 23-player squads. The All-Star team wound up dropped prior to the 2010 tournament - coincidentally, three years after FIFA changed its sponsorship from MasterCard to Visa.\n\nIn 2010, an equivalent of the All Star Team was an online poll to FIFA.com Club members named \"Dream Team\", sponsored by Yingli. The Dream Team poll returned the following edition sponsored by Oi, and again in 2018 sponsored by Hisense.\n\nWhile FIFA did not release an official list for 2014, official sponsor Castrol published a team of the tournament based on their Castrol Performance Index, which evaluates players' performances through statistical data. Similarly, McDonald's sponsored in 2018 a fantasy football game, whose team of highest-scoring players was published after the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The organisation is unrelated to the grant fundraising and management consultancy, grantsmart.co.uk \n\nBeginning in 2000 the IRS required all United States charitable foundations to file the 990-PF form, which details information for each foundation, including the total value of all assets, the investments held by the foundation, as well as complete listings of gifts, contributions and grants paid to nonprofits during the tax year, and grants that have been approved for future payment. Fundraisers and nonprofit researchers also use 990-PF tax returns to research which individuals or corporations are supporting the foundation, and information about the foundation's officers, directors, trustees, managers and contractors, their compensation, and grant application criteria, deadlines and geographical relationships. By accessing and utilizing the 990-PFs, Grantsmart made information available on all foundations, including ones lacking annual reports or websites. The Grantsmart model enabled persons and organizations seeking foundation funding to bypass print directories and use a simple, comprehensive, searchable free database.\n\nIn early 2008 the organization's founders decided to end the project, issuing a statement online:\n\nGrantsmart announced its intention to donate the organization's hardware, which included two Apple Xserves with dual G4 processors, mirrored system drives and SCSI boards, one Apple Xserve with dual G5 processors and a fibre channel board; two Nexsan ATAboy RAID arrays (14 ata drives) with dual power supplies and dual SCSI connections with 4 to 6 TB each. In addition they offered a single Nexsan SATAboy RAID array (14 drives) with 9 TB and a fibre channel connection. They invited applicants with a message, \"If you have a great project underway that can use some or all of this hardware please drop us an email detailing your project, why it's important and how you can use this hardware.\"\n\nIn addition they offered to make their database and technology, archived in a MySQL database (multithreaded, multi-user structured query language database management system) available to any organization that would continue its mission of making the information searchable for free.

Coyote. Unlike the previous four pairings, this cartoon follows the Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner formula (substituting Bugs for the Road Runner). As such, Wile E. Coyote is silent, although Bugs does speak to the audience. \"Hare-Breadth Hurry\" is also one of the few cartoons where Bugs does not eat a carrot.\n\n\"Introduction:\" The cartoon opens as a typical Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner cartoon. After the credits are shown, a high-speed object zooms through the desert until it stops. It is revealed to be Bugs Bunny, who explains why he is in the cartoon instead of the Road Runner - the Road Runner had sprained a giblet. As the coyote approaches, Bugs stops and, with the help of \"Acme Super Speed Pills\", is able to imitate the Road Runner. When the pills wear off and Bugs is forced to use wits to outwit the Coyote, he stops again, and holds up his hand as if to say \"HOLD IT\". Bugs then draws a line in the road, and then a second. As Wile steps in beyond the first line, the bottom falls out from under that segment into an underground river, and Bugs runs off.\n\n1. Wile E. Coyote then tries to capture Bugs using a carrot, but ends up catching a giant fish out of nowhere, who swallows all of Wile E. except for his feet. Wile E. then walks away, still held onto by the fish.\n\n2. Later, Bugs looks on in disbelief (\"It's amazing the trouble this joker goes through to get a square meal.\") as Wile E's attempts to use a rifle to cut a rope holding a rock over a catapult to propel himself over a large gap backfires, sending Wile straight into the rock, with the rifle, having fallen out of Wile's hands, coming back to hit him to shoot Wile straight up vertically.\n\n3. Bugs is running again. (\"It's only sporty to give him a running shot at me once...in a while.\") Wile E. attempts to shoot Bugs as he passes by. Unknown to Wile E., Bugs had hastily attached a maze of pipes to the rifle. When the firing sound is muted and Bugs runs around the mountain, Wile E. Coyote checks out the maze, only for the bullet he fired to exit when he finishes and hit him.\n\n4. Wile E. Coyote then tries to stop Bugs by placing a carrot on a trap (similar to where bird seed would be planted for the Road Runner). Wile E. then drops the anvil upon sight of Bugs, but Bugs then places the target on him. Upon hitting Wile E., the edge of the cliff on which Wile E. was standing dislodges and falls to the ground below, and then the anvil is dropped as the target is pulled. The anvil misses Wile E. Coyote, but he is then run over by a passing truck.\n\n5. Bugs is running yet again. (\"Here we go again. He doesn't give up easy, does he?\".) Wile E. Coyote then tries to be a \"Coyote cannonball\" to speed past Bugs, only to then point the cannon downward via his weight, and launch himself into the ground, forming a crater. After escaping the crater, Wile E. Coyote hits his ear to push rocks out of the other ear.\n\n6. Finally, as Bugs times Wile E.'s arrival to him again, he remarks to the viewers: (\"Yep. Here comes the 5-15 now. Right on time.\") Then Bugs runs off and he is able to place a large patch of glue in the road. Wile E., unable to stop in time, ends up stuck in the puddle and tries to reach a ringing phone some distance away. Bugs answers the phone, which he hands off to Wile E. Coyote, who ends up springing back (phone in hand) the other way, taking the chunk of glued road out of its bed with him, going through a door near a cliff, (Bugs having sped forward to open it) causing Bugs to say \"Pardon me, but look behind you\" through the telephone, and ending up crashing into the side of another cliff behind him. Bugs then says \"Did you realise he almost hit this door?\" The chunk of road, having crushed Wile E. against the cliff, breaks, causing him to fall halfway down. Only the telephone cord prevents him from falling all the way to the ground, but Bugs rings up Wile E. and (mimicking the phone company) remarks \"You haven't paid your telephone bill lately, so we're going to have to cut you off. Sorry.\" Bugs severs the cord and Wile E. becomes a victim to gravity as usual. Bugs then tells the audience \"The moral is, never get cut off in the middle of a long-distance fall\" and he laughs.\n\n\n"}

The Truth Machine is currently under development as a motion picture by Morgan Freeman's Revelations Entertainment.\n\nHalperin graduated from Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts in 1970, then attended Harvard University between 1970-1971 where he majored in psychology and later philosophy. After three semesters, Halperin dropped out to pursue a career in numismatics. In 1976 he established a rare coin fund for investors, New England Rare Coin Fund (NERCF). Upon liquidation at auction in April 1980, each investor in NERCF received 460% of their initial investment after commissions and fees.\n\nIn 1982, he sold his coin company to a former employee, entered into a 50/50 business partnership with renowned numismatist-turned-businessman Steve Ivy and settled in Dallas, Texas. Halperin and Ivy still co-direct Heritage Auctions, of Dallas, Texas, which advertises itself as the world's largest rare coin company and third largest auction house (2012 sales of about $860 million).\n\nA profile on Halperin appeared in \"Forbes\" in 2004, to which Halperin posted an annotated (clarified and/or corrected in footnotes) version on Heritage's website.\n\nHalperin also endows The James & Gayle Halperin Foundation, which supports health and education-related charities.\n\nHe has been married to his wife Gayle since 1984 and they have two sons, David (born 1990) and Michael (born 1995).\n\nHis niece is Molly DeWolf Swenson, American Idol Season 10 contestant and co-founder of RYOT (sold to Huffington Post / AOL in 2016).\n\n"}

Lonclass dates from the 1960s, whereas UDC was created from DDC in the late 19th century. The BBC adaptation of UDC preserves the core features that distinguish UDC from DDC: an emphasis on a compositional semantics that allows new items to be expressed in terms of relationships between known items.\n\nLonclass and UDC (like DDC) are expressed using codes based on decimal numbers. Unlike DDC, the Lonclass and UDC codes use additional punctuation to express patterns of relationships and re-usable qualifiers. While Lonclass makes a few structural adjustments to the UDC system to support its emphasis on TV and radio content, its main distinction is in the actual set of topics that are recorded within its authority file and within specific BBC catalogue records. Unlike UDC and DDC, which are widely used across the library community, Lonclass has remained a BBC-internal system since its creation in the 1960s.\nThere are 300,000 subject terms in the Lonclass vocabulary.\n\nFor example, a Lonclass or UDC code may represent “Report on the environmental impact of the decline of tin mining in Sweden in the 20th century“. This would be represented as a sequence of numbers and punctuation. The complex code can be broken down into primitives such as \"Sweden\" or \"tin mining\" (which itself could be broken down to \"Tin\" and \"Mining\").\n\nSome specific BBC Lonclass examples (with explanatory labels):\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5671762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5671762", "title": "McDonald's legal cases", "text": "McDonald's legal cases\n\nMcDonald's has been involved in a number of lawsuits and other legal cases in the course of the fast food chain's 70-year history. Many of these have involved trademark issues, but McDonald's has also launched a defamation suit which has been described as \"the biggest corporate PR disaster in history\".\n\nOn 30 August 2013, McDonald's published a public notice in select newspapers, declaring that McDonald's India partner Vikram Bakshi had ceased to be the managing director of Connaught Plaza Restaurants (CPRL) pursuant to the expiration of his term on July 17, 2013. CPRL, a joint venture between McDonald's and Vikram Bakshi, is responsible for managing the over 150 McDonald's outlets in North and East regions of India. \nBakshi had been the face of the company in India for almost two decades. After being ousted abruptly, Bakshi sought to fight for his stake and rights in the Company Law Board (CLB). Bakshi claims to have clocked over 490 crore rupees worth of revenue for the American food chain. While McDonald's seeks to buy out Vikram's share despite a huge profit margin, its other joint venture with Amit Jatia, who manages the chain in West and South India under Hardcastle Restaurants, has been brought under radar. On books, McDonald's sold their share of the Hardcastle Restaurants joint venture to co-owner Amit Jatia at a reported loss of 99% in 2011, making it a master franchisee.\n\nThe court is under the ambit of CBL with next hearing scheduled in early October 2013. In 2017, the National Company Law Tribunal reinstated Bakshi as managing director of Connaught Plaza Restaurants.\n\nIn 1996, McDonald’s revoked businessman Roberto Bukele's franchise for his restaurants in El Salvador. McDonald’s told Bukele the franchise he had operated for 24 years had expired and wouldn’t be renewed. Bukele, who had a 1994 agreement that he believed extended the franchise to 2014, refused to close or rebrand his restaurants.\n\nMcDonald’s won in the lower courts, but appellate courts sided with Bukele and eventually in 2012 McDonald's was ordered to pay a $23.9 million judgment to Bukele. \n\nBukele alleged that he never received the $23.9 million judgment and has filed a new demand in court for $21 million in interest on the award.\n\nIn 1990, McDonald's took environmental campaigners Helen Steel and Dave Morris to court after they distributed leaflets entitled \"What's Wrong with McDonald's?\" on the streets of London. The high-profile trial, which came to be known as the McLibel Case, lasted seven and a half years, the longest in English legal history.\n\nThough a High Court judge eventually ruled in favour of McDonald's on some counts, John Vidal called it a Pyrrhic victory. The extended legal battle was a PR disaster, with every aspect of the company's working practices being scrutinised and the media presenting the case as a David and Goliath battle. Additionally, the damages received were negligible compared to the company's estimated £10 million legal costs because the court ruled in favour of a number of the defendants' claims, including that McDonald's exploited children in its advertising, was anti-trade union and indirectly exploited and caused suffering to animals. McDonald's was awarded £60,000 damages, which was later reduced to £40,000 by the Court of Appeal. Steel and Morris announced they had no intention of ever paying, and the company later confirmed it would not be pursuing the money. Steel and Morris went on to challenge UK libel laws in the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that the lack of access to legal aid and the heavy burden of proof that lay with them, as the defendants' requirement to prove their claims under UK law was a breach of the right to a fair trial and freedom of expression. The court ruled in their favour and the UK Government was forced to introduce legislation to change defamation laws.\n\nIn 2004, McDonald's sued Cebu-based fast food restaurant MacJoy for using a very similar trade name. In its defense, MacJoy insisted that it was the first user of the mark under the title \"MACJOY & DEVICE\" for its business in Cebu City which started in 1987, six years after McDonald's opened its first outlet in the same city. MacJoy stated that the requirement of “actual use” in commerce in the Philippines before one may register a trademark pertains to the territorial jurisdiction on a national scale and is not merely confined to a certain locality or region. It added that \"MacJoy\" is a term of endearment for the owner's niece whose name is Scarlett Yu Carcel. In response, McDonald's claimed that there was no connection with the name Scarlett Yu Carcel to merit the coinage of the word \"MacJoy\" and that the only logical conclusion over the name is to help the Cebu restaurant ride high on their (McDonald's) established reputation.\n\nOn February 2007, the Philippine Supreme Court upheld the right of McDonald's over its registered and internationally recognized trademarks. As a result, the owners of MacJoy, the Espina family, was forced to change its trademark into MyJoy, which went into effect with the re-opening of its two branches in Cebu City on August that year.\n\nIn 1994, McDonald's successfully forced Elizabeth McCaughey of the San Francisco Bay Area to change the trading name of her coffee shop \"McCoffee\", which had operated under that name for 17 years. \"This is the moment I surrendered the little 'c' to corporate America,\" said Elizabeth McCaughey, who had named it as an adaptation of her surname.\n\nFrom the early 1960s to the mid-1980s, Norman McDonald ran a small \"Country Drive-Inn\" restaurant in Philpot, Kentucky called simply \"McDonald's Hamburgers; Country Drive-Inn\", which at the time also had a gas station and convenience store. McDonald's the restaurant chain forced Norman to remove the arches and add the full \"Norman\" McDonald's name to its sign so customers would not be confused into thinking the restaurant was affiliated with the McDonald's restaurant chain. The restaurant is still open to this day (though it no longer has the gas station).\n\nIn 2001, McDonald’s lost a nine-year legal action against Frank Yuen, owner of \"McChina Wok Away\", a small chain of Chinese takeaway outlets in London. Justice David Neuberger ruled the McChina name would not cause any confusion among customers and that McDonald's had no right to the prefix Mc.\n\nIn 1996, McDonald's forced Scottish sandwich shop owner Mary Blair of Fenny Stratford, Buckinghamshire to drop McMunchies as her trading name. Mrs. Blair did not sell burgers or chips. She said she chose the name because she liked the word munchies and wanted the cafe to have a Scottish feel. The cafe's sign reflected this, featuring a Scottish thistle and a St Andrew's flag. But in a statement to Mrs. Blair's solicitors, McDonald's said if someone used the Mc prefix, even unintentionally, they were using something that does not belong to them.\n\nAn often reported urban legend maintains that McDonald's filed a lawsuit against MacDonald's Family Restaurant, an actual fast food establishment located in Grand Cayman. This false claim alleges that McDonald's lost the case, and in addition, was banned from ever opening a McDonald's location on Grand Cayman. While it is true that no McDonald’s locations exist on the island, the reason is not due to any lawsuit against MacDonald’s Family Restaurant.\n\nIn 1996, McDonald's lost a legal battle at the Danish Supreme Court to force Allan Pedersen, a hotdog vendor, to drop his shop name \"McAllan\". Pedersen had previously visited Scotland on whisky tasting tours. He named his business after his favorite brand of whisky, MacAllan's, after contacting the distillery to see if they would object. They did not, but McDonald's did. However, the court ruled customers could tell the difference between a one-man vendor and a multi-national chain and ordered McDonald's to pay 40,000 kroner ($6,900) in court costs. The verdict cannot be appealed.\n\nIn 2001, McDonald's sued a small restaurant named \"McCurry\", a popular eatery serving Indian food in Jalan Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. McDonald's claimed that the use of the \"Mc\" prefix infringed its trademark, while the defendant claimed that McCurry stood for \"Malaysian Chicken Curry\". \n\nIn 2006, McDonald's won an initial judgment in the High Court. The judge ruled that the prefix Mc and the use of colours distinctive of the McDonald's brand could confuse and deceive customers. In April 2009, however, a three-member Appeal Court panel overturned the verdict, saying that there was no evidence to show that McCurry was passing off its own product as that of McDonald's. The Appeals Court also said that McDonald's cannot claim an exclusive right to the \"Mc\" prefix in the country. McDonald's appealed the decision to the Federal Court, the highest court in Malaysia. In September 2009, the Federal Court upheld the Appeal Court's decision. McDonald's appeal was dismissed with costs, and was ordered to pay RM10,000 to McCurry.\n\nApartheid politics had prevented earlier expansion into South Africa, but as the apartheid regime came to an end in the early 1990s, McDonald's decided to expand there. The company had already recognized South Africa as a potentially significant market and had registered its name as a trademark there in 1968.\n\nUnder South African law, trademarks cease to be the property of a company if they are not used for a certain amount of time. McDonald's had renewed the 1968 registration several times, but missed a renewal deadline. The registration expired and McDonald’s discovered two fast food restaurants in South Africa were trading under the name MacDonalds. Moreover, a businessman had applied to register the McDonald’s name.\n\nMultiple lawsuits were filed. The fast food chain was stunned when the court ruled it had lost the rights to its world-famous name in South Africa. However, the company eventually won on appeal.\n\nThe company waged an unsuccessful 32-year legal action against McDonald's Family Restaurant which was opened by a man legally named Ronald McDonald, (not to be confused with the restaurants clown mascot) in Fairbury, Illinois in 1956. Mr. McDonald ultimately continued to use his name on his restaurant, despite objections by McDonald's.\n\nIn 2005, McDonald’s tried to stop a Queensland lawyer, Malcolm McBratney, from using the name 'McBrat' on the shorts of the Brisbane Irish Rugby team. McDonald's claimed the McBrat name should not be registered because it was too similar to its McKids trade mark, since the word 'brat' is another term for 'kid'. McBratney, a solicitor specialising in trademarks and intellectual property, argued that his family name had been used in Ireland since the 1600s, and that he had a right to use an abbreviation of that name. In 2006, the Delegate of the Register of Trade Marks held that McBratney could register 'McBrat' as a trademark and that McDonald's had no intellectual property rights over 'Mc' and 'Mac' prefixed words.\n\nMcBratney, who specialises in intellectual property law, then brought a suit against McDonald's for its registration, in Australia in 1987, of 'McKids'. This trademark had never been used in Australia and can therefore be removed for non-use.\n\nIn 1973, Sid and Marty Krofft, the creators of \"H.R. Pufnstuf\", successfully sued McDonald's in \"Sid & Marty Krofft Television Productions Inc. v. McDonald's Corp.\", arguing that the entire McDonaldland premise was essentially a ripoff of their television show. In specific, the Kroffts claimed that the character Mayor McCheese was a direct copy of their character, \"H.R. Pufnstuf\" (being a mayor himself). McDonald's initially was ordered to pay $50,000.\nThe case was later remanded as to damages, and McDonald's was ordered to pay the Kroffts more than $1 million.\n\nMcDonaldland itself, as it was depicted in the commercials, was a magical place where plants, foods, and inanimate objects were living, speaking characters. In addition to being the home to Ronald and the other core characters, McDonaldland boasted \"Thick shake volcanoes\", anthropomorphized \"Apple pie trees\", \"The Hamburger Patch\" (where McDonald's hamburgers grew out of the ground like plants), \"Filet-O-Fish Lake\", and many other fanciful features based around various McDonald's menu items. In the commercials, the various beings are played by puppets or costumed performers, very similar to the popular \"H.R. Pufnstuf\" program.\n\nMcDonald's had originally hoped the Kroffts would agree to license its characters for commercial promotions. When they declined, McDonaldland was created, purposely based on the \"H.R. Pufnstuf\" show in an attempt to duplicate the appeal.\n\nAfter the lawsuit, the concept of the \"magical place\" was all but phased out of the commercials, as were many of the original characters. Those that remained would be Ronald, Grimace, The Hamburglar, and the Fry Kids.\n\nIn 1988, Quality Inns (now Choice Hotels) was planning to open a new chain of economy hotels under the name \"McSleep.\" After McDonald's demanded that Quality Inns not use the name because it infringed, the hotel company filed a suit in federal court seeking a declaratory judgment that \"McSleep\" did not infringe. McDonald's counterclaimed, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. Eventually, McDonald's prevailed. The court's opinion noted that the prefix \"Mc\" added to a generic word has acquired secondary meaning, so that in the eyes of the public it means McDonald's, and therefore the name \"McSleep\" would infringe on McDonald's trademarks.\n\nIn 1996, British adult comic \"Viz\" accused McDonald's of plagiarizing the name and format of its longstanding \"Top Tips\" feature, in which readers offer sarcastic tips. McDonald's had created an advertising campaign of the same name, which showcased the Top Tips (and then suggested the money-saving alternative - going to McDonald's). Some of the similarities were almost word-for-word:\n\nThe case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, which was donated to the charity appeal Comic Relief. However, many Viz readers believed that the comic had given permission for their use, leading to Top Tips submissions such as: \"Geordie magazine editors. Continue paying your mortgage and buying expensive train sets ... by simply licensing the Top Tips concept to a multinational burger corporation.\"\n\nIn March 2001, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a group of South Florida farmworkers, began a campaign demanding better wages for the people who pick the tomatoes used by McDonald's and other fast food companies. McDonald's was the second target after the group succeeded against Taco Bell.\n\nOn November 14, 2018, the Superior Court of Quebec certified a class action on behalf of all consumers worldwide who purchased Happy Meals and Toys in the Province of Quebec (Bramante v. McDonald Restaurants, 2018 QCCS 4852). The Plaintiffs alleged - and the Court agreed at certification - that McDonalds violated section 248 of the \"Consumer Protection Act\" (Quebec) by unlawfully advertising Happy Meals using displays with toys (often related to the newest cinematic release) at children's eye-level inside McDonalds restaurants. Section 248 provides that: \"Subject to what is provided in the regulations, no person may make use of commercial advertising directed at persons under thirteen years of age\". The Court certified the case on behalf of the following class: \"Every consumer pursuant to the Québec \"Consumer Protection Act\" who, since November 15, 2013 purchased in Québec for a child under 13 years of age then present inside a McDonald’s restaurant, a toy or Happy Meal, during an advertising campaign directed at children taking place inside the restaurant\". The Class Action seeks injunctive relief ordering McDonalds to cease marketing to children under 13 years old with its Happy Meal displays, reimbursement of Happy Meal and individual toy sales, as well as punitive damages in amounts to be determined. The case was initially filed on November 15, 2013, by Quebec class action attorney Joey Zukran of LPC Avocat Inc. \n\nIn 2003, a ruling by the UK Advertising Standards Authority determined that the corporation had acted in breach of the codes of practice in describing how its French fries were prepared. A McDonald's print ad stated that \"after selecting certain potatoes\", \"we peel them, slice them, fry them and that's it.\" It showed a picture of a potato in a McDonald's fries box. In fact, the product was sliced, pre-fried, sometimes had dextrose added, was then frozen, shipped, and re-fried and then had salt added.\n\nLawsuits were brought against the McDonald's Corporation in the early 1990s for including beef in its French fries despite claims that the fries were vegetarian. In fact, beef flavoring \"is\" added to the fries during the production phase. The case revolved around a 1990 McDonald’s press release stating that the company's French fries would be cooked in 100% vegetable oil and a 1993 letter to a customer that claimed their French fries are vegetarian. McDonald's denied this. The lawsuits ended in 2002 when McDonald's announced it would issue another apology and pay $100M to vegetarians and religious groups. Subsequent oversight by the courts was required to ensure that the money that was paid by McDonald's: \"to use the funds for programs serving the interests of people following vegetarian dietary practices in the broadest sense.\" There was some controversy in this ruling, as it benefited non-vegetarian groups such as research institutions that research vegetarian diets but do not benefit vegetarians. In 2005, the appeal filed by vegetarians against the list of recipients in this case was denied, and the recipients of the $10M chosen by McDonald's was upheld.\n\nFurther ingredient-related lawsuits have been brought against McDonald's since 2006. McDonald's had included its French fries on its website in a list of gluten-free products; these lawsuits claim children suffered severe intestinal damage as a result of unpublicized changes to McDonald's French fry recipe. McDonald's has provided a more complete ingredient list for its French fries more recently. Over 20 lawsuits have been brought against McDonald's regarding this issue, which the McDonald's Corporation has attempted to consolidate.\n\nIn 2001, 34 claimants (representing some 7,000 claimants) filed a class action lawsuit against McDonald's for false and misleading conduct arising from the \"McMatch & Win Monopoly\" promotion before Justice John Dowsett of the Federal Court of Australia. The claimants had attempted to claim prizes from the 1999 promotion using game tokens from the 1998 promotion, arguing unsuccessfully that the remaining 1998 tokens may have been distributed accidentally by McDonald's in 1999.\n\nIn 2013, McDonald's quit serving halal food at the only two locations in the US that served halal food, both located in Dearborn, MI after a $700,000 lawsuit filed in 2001 where a customer alleged the menu items were not consistently halal. The case was brought to court by Michael Jaafar, a Detroit lawyer of Fairmax Law who filed a consumer protection class action lawsuit against McDonald's for advertising halal foods.\n\nAlso known as the \"McDonald's coffee case\", \"Liebeck v. McDonald's\" is a well-known product liability lawsuit that became a flash point in the debate in the U.S. over tort reform after a jury awarded $2.9 million to Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old woman from Albuquerque, New Mexico, who sued McDonald's after she suffered third-degree burns from hot coffee that was spilled on her at one of the company's drive-thrus in 1992. The trial judge reduced the total award to $640,000, and the parties settled for a confidential amount before an appeal was decided. The case entered popular understanding as an example of frivolous litigation; ABC News calls the case \"the poster child of excessive lawsuits.\" Trial-lawyer groups such as the Association of Trial Lawyers of America and other opponents of tort reform sometimes argue that the suit was justified because of the extent of Liebeck's injuries. In addition, McDonald's failed to provide proper warning. Warning consumers of possible dangers of their products is strictly enforced by the FDA. Furthermore, McDonald's should not be serving substances that are potentially harmful to their consumers.\n\nIn July 2014, a reporter was able to secretly capture film from inside the Shanghai Husi Food factory (a subsidiary of the American OSI group) which showed factory workers violating various safety policies. These included: handling meat with bare hands, picking meat up off the floor and returning it to the processing machine, processing expired meats, and repeatedly reprocessing products that failed inspection until the said products passed inspection. After the video surfaced, Yum Brands (operator of KFC and Pizza Hut in China) discontinued its operations with Husi Foods (and thus OSI Group). However, McDonalds merely switched factories, preferring to continue their association with OSI Group as they believe the quality of meat is higher and this was an isolated incident. \n\n\"Magee v. McDonald's\" is a United States federal class action lawsuit begun in May 2016 in the Illinois Northern District Court, case number 1:16-cv-05652, in which Scott McGee of Metairie, Louisiana is pursuing action against McDonald's due to the company being unwilling to serve people who are visually impaired when only the drive thru lane is open. Because the drive thru lane is sometimes the only method of ordering food once the dining room is closed, this creates a situation in which people who are legally blind, and unable to operate a motor vehicle can not order food from the restaurant while other people are able to do so.\n\nMcDonald’s attempted to get the case dismissed, but in February 2017, a federal court ruled that Magee's lawsuit could proceed. On May 8, 2018, the class was certified.\n\nAs of October 2018, the case continues to drag on, with McDonald’s bringing up new defences. In August 2018, McDonald’s argued that the restaurant was operated by a franchisee, and that the McDonald’s corporation did not control the locking of doors. In October 2018, McDonald’s argued that the restaurant was assessable, because a blind person could obtain food \"through the same UberEats delivery service that everyone else uses,\" even though it would cost $5.00 extra. \n\nOn October 31, 2018, McDonald’s filed a document with the court, arguing that because the restaurants forbid any pedestrian access to their drive-up window, they are not discriminating against the blind. McDonald’s says a blind person has \"the same access as the 13 million adults who are not visually impaired and do not have a car, and that therefore the ADA does not apply.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on May 24, 2018, a law came into effect in Portland Oregon requiring multi-modal access to drive-throughs.\n\n\n"}

According to iSpot.tv, the spot was rated #1 of all the Super Bowl commercials of the night, having generated 2.2 million online views and 300,000 social media interactions after airing.\n\nThe ad features a computer-generated mash-up of three things that the public generally finds to be cute or harmless, all in one body: a Pug puppy (the head), a monkey (the torso and tail) and a dancing baby (the hips and legs, complete with a diaper). The puppy monkey baby repeats its name while dancing with three tired men who are presumably too tired to get out while watching the Super Bowl, offering them Mountain Dew Kickstart, which is similarly described as being a combination of three things (Mountain Dew, juice, and caffeine).\n\nThe media response to the advertisement has been mixed. Melissa Cronin of Gawker, described it as a \"horror-hallucination of brand awareness\", while noting the beverage itself contains brominated vegetable oil, a chemical that is banned in several countries. Jim Joseph, chief integrated marketing officer at Cohn & Wolfe, called it \"weird\". Screwattack declared Puppymonkeybaby as the most terrifying mascot of all time.\n"}
{"id": "36885649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36885649", "title": "Recreation Yard (Alcatraz)", "text": "Recreation Yard (Alcatraz)\n\nThe Recreation Yard was the yard used by inmates of Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary between 1934 and 1963. It is located opposite the Dining Hall south of the end of D-Block on a raised level surrounded by a high wall and fence above it. Guard Tower #3 lay just to the west of the yard. The gun gallery was situated in the yard, mounted on one of the dining hall's exterior walls. The recreation yard faced the mainland.\n\nIn 1936, the previously dirt-covered yard was paved. The yard was part of the most violent escape attempt from Alcatraz in May 1946 when a group of inmates hatched a plot to obtain the key into the recreation yard, kill the tower guards, take hostages, and use them as shields to reach the dock.\nDuring the Occupation of Alcatraz in 1970, between 400 and 700 Native Indians assembled in the recreation yard and demonstrated.\n\nInmates were permitted out into the yard on Saturdays, Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends.\n\nThe prisoners of Alcatraz were permitted to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times, and intellectual games such as chess. Basketball also appears to have been played on the yard judging by the markings which are still visible on the yard today. Baseball and softball were the most popular. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Bank robber and kidnapper Volney Davis was a pitching ace for the Oilers, while Lorenzo Murrietta, doing 40 years for assault and robbery, was the best batter in Alcatraz league play. He had a .402 batting average, with 9 home runs and 45 RBIs for the Cardinals.\nAlthough many of the inmates relished the opportunity to exercise on weekends, violence occasionally occurred, often race related. A notable riot occurred on May 20, 1956 over racial taunts on the diamond between a white and black prisoner during a softball match. \n\nMany of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for active conversation. Machine Gun Kelly and Basil \"The Owl\" Banghart were said to be inseparable in the yard and would spend their whole time walking around it in conversation together. Al Capone, on the other hand, avoided the yard in his later years in the penitentiary as his mind deteriorated. Edwin B. Swope, Warden of Alcatraz from 1948 to 1955, once said, in response to an inmate who complained to him on the yard about his term of 199 years, which was really a life sentence, \"My boy, we're all doing life. Every one of us is doing life.\"\n\nThe Alcatraz recreation yard has been a setting for scenes in numerous films and novels. Scenes have featured prison inmates hatching schemes or being involved in bloody conflicts. The yard featured several times in the 1979 Clint Eastwood film \"Escape from Alcatraz\" including a violent fight; it was parodied in the 1994 Leslie Nielsen film, \"\".\n\n"}

{"id": "28084941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28084941", "title": "Rubber (2010 film)", "text": "Rubber (2010 film)\n\nRubber is a 2010 English-language French independent, satirical horror film about a tire that comes to life and kills people with its psychic powers. It was directed and written by Quentin Dupieux. The film was produced by Realitism Films. It was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 2010, where it received positive reviews from critics.\n\nA group of people in a California desert are gathered to watch a \"film\". A sheriff named Chad, points out that many moments in cinema happen for \"no reason\", that life is full of this \"no reason\", and that \"this film\" (presumably a dual reference to both the \"film\" to be watched by the assembled group and \"Rubber\" itself) is an homage to \"no reason\". Chad is both inside and outside the diegesis, sometimes participating in the narrative action and sometimes commenting on it.\n\nAn accountant then passes out binoculars to the group and rides off on a bicycle. The spectators then start looking through their binoculars into the distance, waiting for the \"film\" to start. Throughout the film, this group of people return in order to gauge their reactions to what has taken place so far.\n\nIn the late 1990s, somewhere in a California desert, a tire named Robert suddenly comes to life. At first, he learns how to stand upright and then how to roll. He comes across a plastic water bottle and, after hesitating, crushes it, comes across a scorpion and crushes it, and finally comes across a glass beer bottle but is unable to crush it by rolling over it. Robert discovers he can psychokinetically causes the bottle to fracture. He tests his newfound powers on a tin can and a rabbit, making them explode.\n\nRobert then sees a woman drive by and attempts to use his powers on her. However, he only succeeds in making her car stall. As the tire begins to roll towards her stalled car, a truck comes by and runs him over. This breaks the connection, allowing the woman's car to start again and she continues on her way. The tire explodes a pied crow, then finds the man that had been driving the truck which ran him over and blows up his head.\n\nArriving in a nearby desert town, Robert comes across the woman from before. She is staying in a motel and, after watching her shower through an open door, the tire goes into the room next to hers. After the motel maid finds the tire showering and throws it out of the room, Robert reenters the room and blows up her head. Chad, the sheriff from the opening of the movie, shows up to investigate the murders. \n\nFor the in-movie audience, two days have passed and most of them are starving; the accountant wakes them up and presents them with a roast turkey. Shortly thereafter, they begin suffering intense abdominal pain. Back in the story proper, Chad is interrogating the motel owner, only to stop abruptly when an alarm goes off. He announces the poison (from the turkey) has had time to do its work, and tries to urge the other characters to go home, since the audience is dead and the movie can now be over. The accountant then informs Chad that one of the audience, a wheelchair-bound man, had not eaten the poisoned food and so the movie has not ended. \n\nEmbarrassed, Chad must continue the plot and returns to his interrogation. Chad witnesses Robert kill the motel owner (who has mistreated it) and leads the cops on a \"tire hunt\". Meanwhile, the accountant tries to poison the man in the wheelchair with more food, but eats it himself and dies.\n\nRobert comes across a group of people burning a large pile of tires, then the film jumps to three days later showing the results of his killing spree. The cops find the tire watching an auto racing program in a house, having killed the occupants. Chad rigs a mannequin (resembling the woman Robert is interested in) with dynamite, intending for the tire to blow the mannequin's head up, thereby also blowing himself up. However, when Robert destroys the mannequin's head, the dynamite does not explode. The man in the wheelchair mocks Chad for his failed plan, enraging Chad enough to unceremoniously end the film by simply shooting Robert with a shotgun off-screen, after which he tosses the remains to the man in the wheelchair, who continues to criticize him for the anticlimax. \n\nAlmost immediately Robert emerges from the house reborn as a Tricycle, prompting the man in the wheelchair to protest to Chad that the film isn't over. Failing that, he protests to Robert that he is an audience member and can't be killed, which the Tricycle proves wrong by exploding his head. Robert begins rolling down the road recruiting an army of tires along the way, eventually rolling to Hollywood, where the film concludes.\n\nDuring the credits, the opening scene plays again, but this time from different angles, revealing that Chad is not speaking to anyone.\n\n\nThe effects of the tire moving were done via practical effects such as remote controls. Director Quentin Dupieux has noted that due to the inherent \"emptiness\" of a tire that making a remote-controlled tire was difficult as \"you can’t really hide the mechanisms well\". CGI effects were used for the shots of heads exploding; during filming Dupieux used practical effects, but he was unhappy with the results.\n\nDuring the writing process, the tire, Robert, was designed solely as a bad guy with no redeeming qualities. While shooting, however, Dupieux determined that this was the wrong approach realizing \"there’s nothing evil about a tire\" based partly on early camera tests. Robert was reworked to be \"more like a stupid dog\". The 2008 animated film \"WALL-E,\" specifically the first act, was also an influence on the character.\n\nThe film begins with Ballard making a speech about how events in movies often happen for \"no reason\". Dupieux has stated he was inclined to put that speech in because he was not interested in explaining how the tire came to life, although he knew such a setup would be expected. The meta element of the film came organically, as Dupieux quickly grew tired of writing about a killer tire. He was partly influenced by an experience where he snuck into a theater playing his previous film \"Steak\" only to find that no one else was in the theater, which he noted was \"kind of scary.\"\n\nThe film was shown on May 15, 2010 at Cannes Critic's Week.\nAfter the film was shown at Cannes, it was picked up for US distribution by Magnet Releasing. \"Rubber\" had its outside-France premiere on July 9, 2010 at the Fantasia Festival.\n\n\"Rubber\" was shown at the Sitges Film Festival where it had a positive reception. The film was shown in Toronto at the After Dark Film Festival. \"Fangoria\" magazine stated the film \"deeply split\" the audience reaction saying that \"Rubber\" earned \"huge laughs and applause as well as the only boos heard by Fango at the fest.\"\n\nThe DVD and soundtrack were made available to purchase from March 14, 2011, and the DVD and Blu-ray Disc from June 7, 2011.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 68% rating based on reviews from 85 critics, the sites consensus reads \"a clever premise gets plenty of comic blood and violence but it's hampered by some questionable storytelling techniques from director Quentin Dupieux. indieWire called the film \"one of the more bizarre experiments with genre in quite some time\" and that it \"does begin to wear out its welcome around the sixty-minute mark, but you can't blame Dupieux for giving it a shot.\"\n\nOutside Cannes, the film received positive reception at other film festivals. Twitch Film gave the film a positive review saying it was \"impeccably shot, scored and designed\", and \"the film is intellectual wankery of the highest order in the sheepskin of a B-film of the lowest order\". \"The Huffington Post\" wrote that Quentin Dupieux \"succeeds in creating an entertaining, sometimes even tense horror film with the very same footage he lightly mocks. The result is an uber-cerebral spoof that is at once silly and smart, populist like a mildly trashy B-movie yet high brow like absurdist theater.\"\n\n\"The Telegraph\" wrote a negative review of the film, saying \"How could it not be brilliant? By, at 85 minutes, being an hour too long. By being arch rather than schlocky. And by wasting too much time on dull dialogue celebrating its 'No Reason' philosophy.\" \"Variety\" also gave a negative review, saying that \"Rubber\" is \"Neither scary, funny, nor anywhere near as clever as it seems to think it is, pic offers auds few reasons to want to see it beyond its one-joke premise.\" Will Leitch from \"The Projector\" concluded his review by stating that \"Rubber\" is \"a movie about how watching movies is stupid,\" giving the film a D score out of a traditional American grading scale.\n\nGregory Bernard said of the film: \"We’re really blessed to have so much attention on such a small film. We both took risks – [Quentin] artistically, me in production – and the fact that we had, in general, a very positive response from the public; we’ve had audiences who really loved it.\"\n\nThe official soundtrack for the film Rubber, by Gaspard Augé and Quentin Dupieux (the latter under his stage name \"Mr. Oizo\"), was released on November 8, 2010 on Ed Banger Records.\n\n"}

Q. v. I. 18), formerly known as the Leningrad Bede, is an Anglo-Saxon illuminated manuscript, a near-contemporary version of Bede's 8th century history, the \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\" (\"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\"). Although not heavily illuminated, it is famous for containing the earliest historiated initial (one containing a picture) in European illumination. It is so named because it was taken to the Russian National Library of Saint Petersburg (later known as Leningrad) in Russia at the time of the French Revolution by Peter P. Dubrovsky.\n\nTraditionally, the Saint Petersburg Bede is attributed on palaeographic grounds to Bede’s monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow. It is also traditionally dated to 731/732 × 746 on the basis of the so-called Memoranda, a series of retrospective dates found in the margins of Bede’s \"recapitulo\" in Book V Chapter 24. The validity of these Memoranda (and similar notes in the Moore Bede) as evidence for the precise year in which the manuscript was copied has been vigorously challenged. While it may not be possible to assign the manuscript to a specific year, it seems unlikely that it was copied much after the middle of the eighth century.\n\nThe manuscript is written on parchment. It contains 162 folios (numbered 161, but with f. 51 repeated—the correct foliation is given on the last folio in the bottom right corner). Pages average approximately 270 × 190 mm (Writing Space: 230 × 150 mm in two columns of 27 lines). The pages have been trimmed at some point. The manuscript has been copied by four hands, with textual \"accessories\" (colophons, chapter numbers, and the like) in a fifth (Parkes 1982, 6-11). The opening three letters of Book 2 of Bede are decorated, to a height of 8 lines of the text, and the opening h contains a bust portrait of a haloed figure carrying a cross and a book. This may be intended to be St. Gregory the Great, although a much later hand has identified the figure as St. Augustine of Canterbury in the halo. The figure is identified as a saint, rather than Christ, by his clerical tonsure. Although the letter decoration is essentially Insular in style, the figure shows Mediterranean influence, as do other elements of the illuminations, such as the foliate decoration filling in the B shown above.\n\nThe Saint Petersburg Bede contains one of the two oldest surviving examples of the \"m-type\" text of the Latin \"Historia ecclesiastica\" (Colgrave and Mynors 1969, xliv). The manuscript also contains one of two copies of the vernacular text of the Northumbrian \"aelda\" recension of \"Cædmon's Hymn\" in the bottom margin of \"f. 107r\" (actually f. 108r; see Cædmon). The poem has been copied in the fourth hand of the main Latin text (Parkes 1982, 6).\n\nThe Saint Petersburg Bede is a frequently studied manuscript.

It is anonymous but according to all historians the author is the outstanding humanist Poul Helgesen (Latin: \"Paulus Helie\"). Formally the work covers the period 1047-1534, but the main part is about the reigns of Christian II and Frederick I.\n\nThe work is a sometimes very personal description of Danish history during the last decades of Catholicism, marked by the author’s sympathy for and (mainly) antipathy against the political actors. Especially his portrait of Christian II is a very subjective one, affected by his negative attitude to the king’s anti-aristocratic policy and his use of violence. Also Frederick I, regarded by Helgesen as a traitor to the Catholic cause, is harshly treated. The description ends abruptly during the Count’s War, perhaps because of Helgesen’s death.\n\nFormally the chronicle is built up very much like the annals, which means that great and small events are often mentioned together – deaths among the local clergy alternating with battles and wars – but it often contains valuable material. For instance, the nobility’s letter of complaint over Christian II is repeated.\n\nIn general the chronicle reflects the author’s bitterness, sorrow and frustration because of the course of events. His hot temper often breaks through, invectives and personal injuries reveal a man who was deeply engaged in the struggle. His hatred toward the Protestant agitators is just as outspoken as is his contempt and indignation at the last Catholic bishops and their behaviour. In spite of this subjectivity, the chronicle makes an interesting picture of pre-Reformation Denmark viewed through the eyes of a disillusioned Reform Catholic.\n\nThe original manuscript was found 1650, walled in behind the altar of the Church of Skibby. It was printed in Latin 1773 and translated into Danish 1890-1891.\n"}
{"id": "19058437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19058437", "title": "The Museum of Innocence", "text": "The Museum of Innocence\n\nThe Museum of Innocence () is a novel by Orhan Pamuk, Nobel-laureate Turkish novelist published on August 29, 2008. The book, set in Istanbul between 1975 and 1984, is an account of the love story between the wealthy businessman Kemal and a poorer distant relative of his, Füsun.\n\nPamuk said he used YouTube to research Turkish music and film while preparing the novel.\n\nIn the writing of this book, Pamuk was influenced by the Bagatti Valsecchi Museum in Milan, Italy, as he noted in the museum's guestbook on June 27, 2007: “It is the third time that I have visited this extraordinary museum. I love this house, the idea and the imagination that hide behind these walls. They influenced me a lot for the novel I am writing, \"The Museum of Innocence\". I am happy to be here for the third time.” \n\nAn excerpt, entitled \"Distant Relations\", appeared in \"The New Yorker\" on September 7, 2009.\n\nThe English translation, by his long-time collaborator Maureen Freely, was released on October 20, 2009 by Alfred A. Knopf.\n\nKemal has been engaged to a pretty girl named Sibel for two months when he meets a shop girl, Füsun, while buying a handbag for his fiancee. What follows in the next month and a half is an intense and secretive physical and emotional relationship between them. Kemal's happiest moment of life comes while making love the day Füsun confesses her deep love for him. Though it is clear that he has also fallen completely for Füsun, Kemal keeps denying this to himself, believing that his marriage with Sibel and secret relationship could continue forever. His reverie is broken when Füsun disappears just after attending his engagement. Now he has to come to terms with his deep attachment and love for Füsun. He goes through a very painful period for about a year, unable to meet Füsun and deriving consolation from objects and places related to his beloved and their lovemaking. His engagement to Sibel breaks off and finally Füsun responds to his letter and agrees to meet him. Füsun has got married, living with her husband and parents and pretends to meet Kemal just as a distant relation, with undercurrents of anger. For the next eight years Kemal keeps visiting the family for supper and expressing his love for Füsun in various ways, while finding consolation in various objects related to her that he carries away from the house. Finally after her father’s death, circumstances lead Füsun to divorce her husband. Füsun and Kemal are to be married after a trip around Europe together, but fate has something else in store and they become separated forever after a night of intense love-making. Kemal regards each object related to Füsun and their love, collected over the years, as portraying some discrete moment of happiness and bliss in the passage of those nine years. He decides to convert Füsun’s house into a museum of innocence, including all these objects and also other memorabilia related to the period.\n\nPamuk's work often deals with clash of culture between East and West, which was cited as part of the reason for him being awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. This novel continuously references the influence of the West (Europe and America) on Istanbul's culture, through both the idea of museums and the film industry, which becomes a large part of the novel.\n\nThe book, along with its accompanying museum, continuously refers to museums and collections. The idea of hoarding and collecting as a shameful act that becomes public and appreciated in the form of a museum is addressed particularly in the last chapters.\n\nOne of the key themes throughout the novel is the role of the female in Turkish culture. The novel describes the ostracism of women who have lost their virginity before marriage, despite the fact that many claim to have a \"more western\" attitude toward this in 1970s Istanbul. Pamuk describes this as the taboo of virginity that is part of an old system in Turkey.\n\nIn an interview Pamuk blended all of these themes as he commented on how the role of the museum is also one of ownership, as Kemal looks to own Füsun as a trinket in his own museum, rather than allow her autonomy of her own life.\n\nPamuk has established an actual \"Museum of Innocence\", based on the museum described in the book. It is housed in a building in the Çukurcuma neighbourhood of Beyoğlu, Istanbul, and displays a collection evocative of everyday life and culture of Istanbul during the period in which the novel is set. Originally, the museum was scheduled to be exhibited at Frankfurt’s Schirn Kunsthalle in October 2008, during the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, but the exhibition was cancelled. In 2010, Pamuk still hoped that the museum would be opened in 2011. After much delay, the museum was finally inaugurated in April 2012. Although created later, the museum and the novel were conceived of in tandem, displaying the obsessive romance between two Istanbul families, as well as eternalizing a perspective on upper-class Istanbul in the 1970s. The project was supported by Istanbul 2010 – European Capital of Culture. According to the book, the museum allows free entry to those who bring a copy of the book. A ticket placed in the 83rd chapter of the book will be stamped before ushering the reader in.\n"}

{"id": "29228689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29228689", "title": "Tiger versus lion", "text": "Tiger versus lion\n\nHistorically, a comparison of the tiger (\"Panthera tigris\") versus the lion (\"Panthera leo\") has been a popular topic of discussion by hunters, naturalists, artists, and poets, and continues to inspire the popular imagination. In the past, lions and tigers reportedly competed in the wilderness, where their ranges overlapped in Eurasia. The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in captivity, either deliberately or accidentally.\n\nBoth the lion and the tiger have fearsome reputations in their native areas in relation to prey, sympatric predators, and people. Both may prey on humans, though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the tiger. General differences in behaviour:\n\nMore specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be promiscuous. However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary, with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating, similar to tigers, and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity to defend their cubs, African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.\n\nIn the circuses of Ancient Rome, exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other, including Barbary lions and tigers. A mosaic in the House of the Faun in Pompeii shows a fight between a lion and a tiger. There are different accounts of which of these animals won victory. Although lions and tigers can be kept together in harmony in captivity, fatal conflicts have also been recorded.\n\nCurrently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers. Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past, and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.\n\nBefore the end of the 20th Century, lions and tigers had also occurred in other Asian or Eurasian nations, including Iran. As such, there is a word for 'Lion', which can also mean 'Tiger', and is used in Iran, South Asia and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' (), and its significance is discussed below. The lion is also of cultural importance in the Far East, including the land of the Indochinese tiger, but according to authors such as Reginald Innes Pocock (1939) and Nowell and Jackson (1996), the lion did not naturally occur there.\n\nAccording to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large herbivores, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers on an individual basis, as they would with each other.\n\nApart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce hybrid offspring, which would be ligers or tigons. From the fossil record, besides genetics, it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the Pleistocene, when now-extinct relatives also existed there. Additionally, in the days before Indian Independence, the Maharaja of Gwalior introduced African lions into his area, which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.\n\nThe possibility of conflict, between lions and tigers, had been raised in relation to India's Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project, which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the Indian lion, that is Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, before December 2017. Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'. Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would \"trigger frequent clashes.\" The University of Minnesota's Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an Indian lion, given its weight advantage. Despite the fact that the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey, these lions are social like their African relatives, and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary, and it is believed that a group of lions (2 – 3 males) or lionesses (2 – 4 females) is more than a match for a single tiger or tigress (see ). Therefore it would appear that in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups rather than as individuals.\n\nReginald Innes Pocock (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Subcontinent, before lions. The tigers likely entered Northern India from the eastern end of the Himalayas, through Burma, and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from Balochistan or Persia, and spread to places like the Bengal and the Nerbudda River. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it, as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers. As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.\n\nIn addition to historical recordings, clashes between lions and tigers were reported or even caught on camera, in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was not always clear which species regularly beat the other, according to Doctor Packer (2015).\n\n\n\nGenerally, in terms of dimensions of the body and weight, the modern tiger and lion are the two largest species of the genus \"Panthera\" and the cat family. Variations in opinions and measurements exist for them, especially across different populations or subspecies. Apart from that, similarities and differences exist for other characteristics, such as the lengths of their skulls.\n\n\n\n\nBattles between the two were painted in the 18th and 19th centuries by Eugène Delacroix, George Stubbs and James Ward. Ward's paintings, which portrayed lion victories in accordance with the lion's symbolic value in Great Britain, have been described as less realistic than Stubbs.\n\nThe British Seringapatam medal shows a lion defeating a tiger in battle; an Arabic language banner on the medal displays the words \"Asad Allāh al-Ghālib\" (, \"Lion of God the Conqueror\"). The medal commemorated the British victory at the 1799 Battle of Seringapatam (in the town now known as Srirangapatna) over Tipu Sultan — who used tigers as emblems, as opposed to the British emblematic use of lions.\n\n18th-century naturalists and authors compared the species' characters, generally in favor of the lion. Oliver Goldsmith ranked the lion first among carnivorous mammals, followed by the tiger, which in his view \"seems to partake of all the noxious qualities of the lion, without sharing any of his good ones. To pride, courage and strength, the lion joins greatness, clemency and generosity; but the tiger is fierce without provocation, and cruel without necessity.\" Charles Knight, writing in \"The English Cyclopaedia\", disparaged the opinions of naturalists Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon and Thomas Pennant in this context, stating \"the general herd of authors who eulogise the 'courage, greatness, clemency and generosity' of the lion, contrasting it with the unprovoked ferocity, unnecessary cruelty and poltroonery of the tiger, becomes ridiculous, though led by such names as Buffon and Pennant.\"\n\nIn the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Narada told Srinjaya that tigers were fiercer and more ruthless than lions. This is in contrast with other literature from ancient India, which prefers the lion to the tiger. For example, Vedic literature depicted the lion, rather than the tiger, as the \"king of the forest.\"\n\nThe lion and tiger rival each other in Iranian literature. For example, Humphreys and Kahrom, in their 1999 book \"Lion and Gazelle: The Mammals and Birds of Iran\", treated them as the \"two greatest and most beautiful\" of Iranian carnivores, albeit being extinct there. As with the lion, the tiger's Persian name was used for people and places.\n\nAbout the lion's mane, Knight wrote \"The lion has owed a good deal to his mane and his noble and dignified aspect; but appearances are not always to be trusted.\" In fact, a study was done by scientists Craig Packer and Peyton West that claimed that the mane of the lion was strictly for mating purposes. Darker-maned lions were more often picked by females to breed, while light-maned lions were not so lucky. A lion's mane did not always purposely help in a fight, and it might even hinder the male lion, slowing it down when it attacks, according to Packer and West.\n\nHowever, Dereck Joubert (1996), who spent many hours studying lions in Botswana, believed that the mane could defend the lion's throat, in a fight with another lion, and Clyde (1939) and Kailash (1978) believed that the mane could defend part of the lion's neck, in a fight against the tiger. Reports also support these claims, for example, when the Shimlan tiger fought Atlas, it tried biting Atlas' neck, but it could not, due to the mane blocking its teeth, and interfering with its respiratory system. According to Heptner and Sludskii (1997), Barbary and Cape lions had the \"most luxuriant and extensive manes\" among lions, with \"tresses on flanks and abdomen.\" As for the Asiatic lion, which has a smaller mane than its African cousins, apart from African lions that have weak manes or are maneless, during the fight reported by \"The Sun (New York)\" (1889), though the tiger could bite the lion's body, it was not mentioned to have bitten the lion's neck.\n\nThe term \"Tiger economy\" has been applied to Asian countries that have undergone rapid economic growth, and the term \"Lion economy\" to their African counterparts. The two sides, nicknamed the \"Asian tigers\" and \"African lions\" have also been compared.\n\nIn \"Paalai\", a Tamil film, there is dialogue about the characteristics of the tiger and lion. It concludes that the tiger is superior. In the film, the tiger is the symbol and flag of the native Tamil tribal people and the lion is the symbol and flag of non-Tamil Singhal (literally meaning 'Leonine') people.\n\n\n\n"}
