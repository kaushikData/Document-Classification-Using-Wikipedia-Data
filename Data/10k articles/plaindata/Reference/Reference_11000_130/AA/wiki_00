{"id": "5095127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5095127", "title": "Arbeia", "text": "Arbeia\n\nArbeia was a large Roman fort in South Shields, Tyne & Wear, England, now ruined, and which has been partially reconstructed. It was first excavated in the 1870s and all modern buildings on the site were cleared in the 1970s. It is managed by Tyne and Wear Museums as Arbeia Roman Fort and Museum.\n\nThe fort stands on the Lawe Top, overlooking the River Tyne. Founded in 120 AD, The Roman Fort guarded the main sea route to Hadrian's Wall. It later became the maritime supply fort for Hadrian's Wall, and contains the only permanent stone-built granaries yet found in Britain. It was occupied until the Romans left Britain in the 5th century.\n\nA possible meaning for \"Arbeia\" is \"fort of the Arab troops\", referring to the fact that part of its garrison at one time was a squadron of Mesopotamian boatmen from the Tigris. From archaeological evidence, such as the gravestone of Victor, described below, it is known that a squadron of Spanish cavalry, the First Asturian, was stationed there. It was common for forts to be manned by units originally from elsewhere in the empire, though often enough these would assimilate and end up by recruiting locally.\n\nThrough the course of history of Arbeia, the fort has had several guises; From a busy cosmopolitan port to being the Roman Emperor's HQ for the Scottish invasion. It was a huge supply base for the Roman army, having hosted 600 Roman troops and is said to be the birthplace of the Northumbrian King Oswin.\n\nTwo monuments in the museum at Arbeia testify to the cosmopolitan nature of its shifting population. One commemorates Regina, a British woman of the Catuvellauni tribe (approximately modern Hertfordshire). She was first the slave, then the freedwoman and wife of Barates, a merchant from Palmyra (now part of Syria) who, evidently missing her greatly, set up a gravestone after she died at the age of 30. (Barates himself is buried at the nearby fort of Coria (Corbridge).) The second commemorates Victor, another former slave, freed by Numerianus of the Ala I Asturum, who also arranged his funeral (\"piantissime\": with all devotion) when Victor died at the age of 20. The stone records that Victor was \"of the Moorish nation\".\n\nThe museum also holds an altarpiece to a previously unknown god and a tablet with the name of the Emperor Alexander Severus (died 235) chiselled off.\nThe Reconstruction of the fort has been accomplished using research which was undertaken following excavations, standing where it had originally existed during the Roman occupation of Britain. \n\nA Roman gatehouse, barracks and Commanding Officer's house have been reconstructed on their original foundations. The gatehouse holds many displays related to the history of the fort, and its upper levels provide an overview of the archaeological site.\n\n"}

Industry made the Black Country but horses kept it moving.\n\nHorses would have been stabled close to their trade in a yard. The Carters Yard at the Black Country Living Museum is a prime example. The Carters Yard contains a stable carefully dismantled and moved from Burntwood, Cannock. It stood in the backyard of a cottage in Ogley Hay Road and was probably built in 1900.

The version entitled \"Brenhinoedd y Saeson\" (\"Kings of the English\") combines material from the Welsh annals with material from an English source.\n\nThe Peniarth MS. 20 version begins in 682 with a record of the death of Cadwaladr and ends in 1332. The entries for the earlier years are brief, usually records of deaths and events such as eclipses, plagues or earthquakes, but later entries give much more detail. The main focus is on the rulers of the kingdoms of Gwynedd, Powys and Deheubarth, but ecclesiastical events are also mentioned, such as the bringing of the date of celebrating Easter in the Welsh church into line with Rome by \"Elbodius\" (Elfodd), Bishop of Bangor, in 768. Events in England, Ireland, Scotland and sometimes France are also briefly chronicled.\n\nThe original monastic annals are thought to have been written at Strata Florida Abbey, but may have been kept at the old abbey at Llanbadarn Fawr in the 11th century.

{"id": "3218952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3218952", "title": "Collection (artwork)", "text": "Collection (artwork)\n\nA museum is distinguished by a collection of often unique objects that forms the core of its activities for exhibitions, education, research, etc. This differentiates it from an archive or library, where the contents may be more paper-based, replaceable and less exhibition oriented, or a private collection of art formed by an individual, family or institution that may grant no public access. A museum normally has a collecting policy for new acquisitions, so only objects in certain categories and of a certain quality are accepted into the collection. The process by which an object is formally included in the collection is called \"accessioning\" and each object is given a unique accession number.\n\nMuseum collections, and archives in general, are normally catalogued in a collection catalogue, traditionally in a card index, but nowadays in a computerized database. Transferring collection catalogues onto computer-based media is a major undertaking for most museums. All new acquisitions are normally catalogued on a computer in modern museums, but there is typically a backlog of old catalogue entries to be computerized as time and funding allows.\n\nMuseum collections are widely varied. There are collections of art, of scientific specimens, of historic objects, of living zoological specimens and much more. Because there are so many things to collect, most museums have a specific area of specialization. For example, a history museum may only collect objects relevant to a particular county or even a single person, or focus on a type of object such as automobiles or stamps. Art museums may focus on a period, such as modern art, or a region. Very large museums will often have many subcollections, each with its own criteria for collecting. A natural history museum, for example, will have mammals in a separate collection from insects.\n\nBecause museums cannot collect everything, each potential new addition must be carefully considered as to its appropriateness for a given museum's defined area of interest.\n\nAccessioning is the formal, legal process of accepting an object into a museum collection. Because accessioning an object carries an obligation to care for that object in perpetuity, it is a serious decision. While in the past many museums accepted objects with little deliberation, today most museums have accepted the need for formal accessioning procedures and practices. These are typically set out as part of a museum's Collections Management Policy or CMP.\n\nWhile each museum has its own procedures for accessioning, in most cases it begins with either an offer from a donor to give an object to a museum, or a recommendation from a curator to acquire an object through purchase or trade.\n\nSeveral issues must be considered in the decision to accept an object. Common issues include:\n\n\nAnswering these questions often required investigating an object's provenance, the history of an object from the time it was made.\n\nMany museums will not accession objects that have been acquired illegally or where other parties have an interest in the object. In art museums, special care is given to objects that changed hands in European countries during World War II and archaeological objects unearthed after the 1970 UNESCO Convention covering the transport of cultural property. Other disciplines have different concerns. For example, anthropology museums will pay special attention to Native American objects that may be subject to repatriation, and paleontology museums may look carefully at whether proper permitting procedures were followed when they are offered fossil collections.\n\nWhile in the past, museums often accepted objects with donor-based restrictions, many museums today ask that gifts be given unrestricted. Common donor restrictions include requiring that an object always be exhibited, or that a collection stays together. However, such restrictions can prevent museums from changing their exhibits as scholarship evolves and may introduce conservation issues for delicate objects not suited to continued display.\n\nFinal decision to accept an object generally lies with the museum's board of trustees. In large museums, a special committee may meet regularly to review potential acquisitions. Once the decision has been made to accept an object, it is formally accessioned through a Deed of Gift and entered into the museum's catalog records. Each object is given a unique catalog number to identify it. Objects are then packed for appropriate archival storage, or prepared for exhibition or other educational use.\n\nOnce accessioned into the collection, museum objects must be appropriately cared for. New objects may be examined by a conservator and treated for any pre-existing damage. The object is then cataloged by a curator or other specialist with knowledge of the object's importance and history. The object will then be given an appropriate storage location.\n\nMuseum storage conditions are meant to protect the object and to minimize any deterioration. This often means keeping objects in a stable climate, preventing exposure to pests, minimizing any handling, and using only archival materials that will not deteriorate or harm the objects. Object safety also include providing appropriate security, and planning for disasters and other threats, and making sure that museum staff are trained in proper handling procedures.\n\nDifferent types of objects have different requirements, and many museums have specialized storage areas. For example, framed paintings may be stored in racks in one room while unframed paintings are kept in large drawers in another. Some objects have extremely specialized needs. For example, material from underwater archaeological sites may need to be kept wet, and some very rare and badly deteriorated objects require oxygen-free environments.\n\nAt any given time, museums display only a portion of their collections. This is often because exhibition requires much more space than storage, and is impractical for the entire collection to be out. Museums may also contain many duplicate or similar objects and find that a few specimens are better suited to display than others. In addition, certain objects, particularly works on paper and textiles, are damaged by light and must only be displayed for short periods of time.\n\nMuseum collections are often made up of a variety of materials in a single collection including, but not limited to: canvas, oil and/or acrylic paints, wood, ivory, paper, bone, leather, and textiles. The biggest conservation issue for museum collections is the fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature. Relative Humidity (RH) is a measure of the percentage of saturation of the air.\n\nTemperature is not as important to the life of a work of art, but it is true that chemical reactions occur faster at higher temperatures. However, a museum must take into account the comfort of its staff and visitors and it has been widely accepted that 68 °F-75 °F does not cause a lot of problems for most artifacts and is comfortable for most humans.\n\nIt has also been internationally agreed upon that the RH should be set at 50%–55%. This has become widely accepted because the lower limit was set at 45% since damage to organic materials begin to occur below this point. The upper limit is placed at 65% because mold flourishes at 70% RH. It is also cheaper for most institutions to maintain 50% RH rather than 45% or 60%. There is some exception when it comes to tropical climates since the indigenous artifacts are acclimated to RH levels higher than the “museum norm”. Changes can be made to a museum’s RH to accommodate the changing seasons, but they must be made gradually. Humidity should change in 2% per month increments (an increase in 1 °F will affect a decrease of about 2% RH).\n\nDeaccessioning, the process of disposing, selling or trading objects from a museum collection, is not undertaken lightly in most museums. There are ethical issues to consider since many donors of objects typically expect the museum to care for them in perpetuity. Deaccessioning of an object in a collection may be appropriate if a museum has more than one example of that object and if the object is being transferred to another museum. It may also be appropriate if an object is badly deteriorated or threatening other objects.\n\nThe decision to deaccession includes two parts. These are making the decision to deaccession and deciding the method of disposal. Generally, first choice is to transfer an object to another use or division in a museum, such as deaccessioning a duplicate object from a permanent collection into a teaching collection. Second choice is to transfer the object to another institution, generally with local institutions having priority. The American Alliance of Museums and other regional associations often operate lists or boards to help facilitate such transfers. Last choice is sale on the open market. Open market sales are generally expected to take place at auction rather than through private sale, and are typically most common in art museums due to the high monetary value of art collections.\n\nA controversial example occurred when the last remaining complete dodo mount in a museum collection at Oxford University was deaccessioned due to its deterioration in 1775. Another case was the sale of a J. M. W. Turner painting in the collection of Royal Holloway, University of London to the Getty Museum to fund the maintenance of the building, despite the fact that the original benefactor had expressly requested that the collection be kept intact.\n\nMany ethical guidelines for deaccessioning require that the funds generated by disposing of collection items be used only to increase or maintain the remaining collection. For example, the International Council of Museums (ICOM) Code of Ethics states that:\n\n\"Money or compensation received from the deaccessioning and disposal of objects and specimens from a museum collection should be used solely for the benefit of the collection and usually for acquisitions to that same collection\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, guidelines governing deaccessioning and other ethically difficult issues can be found in the Museums Association's \"Code of Ethics\". In the United States, the guidelines on these matters are issued by the American Alliance of Museums.\n\nThe American Alliance of Museums Code of Ethics takes the position that \"in no event shall they [deaccessioning proceeds] be used for anything other than acquisition or direct care of collections\".\n\nOther museums may have additional restrictions on the use of funds from deaccessioning. For example, at some museums funds from deaccessioning a work of art can only be used to purchase a work of similar style or period (for example, funds from selling a 20th-century American print could not be used to buy a 17th-century Italian painting) and the name of the donor of the sold work remains associated with the purchased artwork.\n\nSelling artwork to fund budget deficits and pay salaries is like \"burning down your house to heat the kitchen.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The screenplay was written by Bava, Argento, Franco Ferrini and Dardano Sacchetti, from a story by Sacchetti. Filming took place in Berlin and Rome.\n\nThe film was followed up by seven sequels (most of which are in-name only), beginning with \"Demons 2\" in 1986.\n\nOn the Berlin subway, university student Cheryl gets off at her stop in the deserted subway station and is pursued by a mysterious, masked man. Rather than attacking her, the man offers her tickets to a free screening at the Metropol, an isolated and recently renovated local cinema. Cheryl talks her friend Kathy into going with her and they skip class to go see the film. At the crowded theater, they meet two preppy college boys, George and Ken, who take an immediate liking to the girls and help them get a can of cola out of the vending machine. The four sit together in the theater.\n\nThere are many people from all walks of life in the audience; a blind man and his guide daughter, a married couple, a boyfriend and girlfriend, and a pimp named Tony along with his two prostitutes who look at the theater's display props in the foyer. One of the prostitutes, Rosemary, scratches her face with a bizarre display mask before they go in to watch the film. The film being shown is a violent, disturbing horror film which features a look-alike of the mask from the lobby; it is about four teenagers who discover an old tomb and dig up the grave of a sixteenth-century fortune teller called Nostradamus. When the teenagers dig up Nostradamus's coffin, they find no body and instead an old book and a mask identical to the strange mask in the foyer. When one of the movie's characters puts the mask on and is scratched by it just like Rosemary was by its doppelganger, he then turns evil and slaughters his friends with a kitchen knife.\n\nRosemary feels ill and goes to the bathroom, where the scratch on her face bursts open and spews out pus, she then transforms into a bloodthirsty, red-eyed demon like the one in the film. Rosemary attacks her friend, Carmen, who then rips through the screen and transforms into a demon in front of the rest of the cinema-goers. The group of uninfected people race to any exit they can find, only to find that they have all been bricked up making escape impossible. Although they attempt to barricade themselves in the balcony, many are attacked and infected by the demons. One of the demons escapes into the city when four punks break into the building through a back entrance; the punks are soon transformed into demons as well.\n\nIn the cinema, only George and Cheryl remain uninfected. Using a display motorcycle and sword props from the foyer, they ride through the auditorium, slicing down many demons. George kills nearly all of them when suddenly, a helicopter crashes through the roof. George and Cheryl use an emergency grappling hook and winch to climb to the roof, where they are attacked by the mysterious man from the subway. They are able to kill him by impaling his head on an exposed bit of rebar. The two climb down to the street and discover that the demonic infection has spread throughout Berlin. They are then chased by a horde of demons before being picked up by a jeep of well-armed survivors (a father and his two children) and they make their escape. As they drive out of the city to safety, (during the end credits) Cheryl (having been infected at some point in the theater) transforms into a demon and before she can harm George, Cheryl is shot by one of the other passengers (Kirk), having her body fall out of the jeep and onto the road. With George being the cinema's last survivor, he escapes with the family in the jeep into a distant unknown future.\n\n\n\nDario Argento had an important influence on \"Dèmoni\". In addition to co-writing the script, he also produced the film. Argento's daughter, Fiore, plays the character of Hannah. Michele Soavi, a devotee of Argento's work and his assistant director on several films, also served as an assistant director on \"Dèmoni\" and has two starring roles, as the man wearing the silver mask and as Jerry, one of the characters in the film playing at the Metropol. Nicoletta Elmi, who plays the usherette, appeared in Argento's 1975 classic giallo \"Deep Red\", and she also had a small role in the 1971 horror film \"Twitch of the Death Nerve\" (directed by Mario Bava, the father of \"Dèmoni\" director Lamberto Bava).\n\nMost of the interior cinema scenes were shot in an actual closed down movie theatre. The building still exists but is now a bank. At the same time, the building used for the exterior shots of the movie theatre still exists; it's a club called \"Goya\", whose appearance in the film has brought it fame and regularly hosts horror conventions today. Filming took place in Germany and Italy, and as a reference to these countries' cinema, posters for Werner Herzog's \"\" and Argento's \"Four Flies on Grey Velvet\" can be seen hanging in the Metropol's lobby.\n\n\"Demons\" was released theatrically on 4 October 1985 in Italy.\n\n\"Demons\" holds a 56% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on nine reviews. Leonard Maltin gave the film 1 out of 4 stars, criticizing the film's lack of characterizations, logic and plot.\n\nThe film was listed at number 53 on US TV channel Bravo's \"The 100 Scariest Movie Moments\" countdown.\n\nThe soundtrack was released on LP. It has 1980s rock and heavy metal themes, while the sequel was pop and new wave oriented. The soundtrack was performed live for the film's thirty-year anniversary at Shock Pop Comiccon in February 2015. The instrumental soundtrack was composed by Claudio Simonetti.\n\n\nSome of the films mentioned below are not sequels, and are related in title only as a marketing strategy to gain popularity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28796116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28796116", "title": "EMVA1288", "text": "EMVA1288\n\nEMVA1288 is an electronic measurement standard developed by the European Machine Vision Association (EMVA). Its purpose is to define the methods to measure and characterize image sensors and cameras that are used in machine vision. It also provides rules and guidelines on how to report results and how to write device datasheets.\n\nThe main goal of the standard is to characterize industrial cameras. Therefore, photography and television standards are not applicable. It was necessary to define a new standard specific to machine vision applications.\n\nThe standard is free to use and free to download but the user must register to EMVA to have the right to use the \"EMVA1288 compliant\" logo on their publications or products.\n\nWork on the 1288 standard started in 2004. Release 1 for monochrome cameras was released in August 2005. In Release A2.01, issued in August 2007 included an additional linearity module. With Release 3, published on November 2010 the first version was available that covered monochrome and color cameras as well as area and line cameras together with a characterization of defect pixels.\nRelease 3.1 came into effect on December 30, 2016. This release contains only a few refinements and additions. Its major new feature is a standardized summary datasheet making camera comparison even easier. The most important refinement is a definition of the camera signal nonlinearity better adapted to cameras with a higher dynamic range. The only two other major additions are: a) the total SNR curve which includes the spatial nonuniformities, and b) diagrams of horizontal and vertical profiles for a meaningful and well-arranged characterization of the different types of the spatial nonuniformities.\n\nThe standardization committee was chaired by Martin Wäny from Awaiba until 2007. Since 2008 the chair is Bernd Jähne, HCI, Heidelberg University.\n\nThe standard only uses radiometric units like watts, joules, number of photons, volts, etc. There is no use of photometric units like lux.\n\nThe 1288 standard is based on a linear camera model. All noise sources except for photon noise and quantization noise can be included into a single parameter, the variance of the dark noise. Thus the model contains only three basic unknowns: the quantum efficiency, the dark noise and the system gain.\n\nThe standard is made of various modules. Some modules being mandatory, others being optional. For each module, a simple mathematical model of the phenomenon or parameter to be described is built. Then, a method to acquire specific image data is defined. Finally, out of the measured data, the parameter is computed using simple formulas.\n\nThe response is a plot of the camera's output (in digital numbers) versus the impinging light (as amount of photons). The slope of this plot is the response of the camera. The deviation from an ideal straight line is a measurement of the non-linearity of the camera.\n\nThe photon transfer is a plot of the variance of the camera's output (in digital numbers squared) versus the output of the camera for the same amount of impinging photons (in digital numbers). The maximum of this curve defines the saturation capacity. The leftmost point defines the dark noise and the slope defines the noise caused by the light itself.\n\nThe summary data sheet contains three major elements:\n\nContains a complete description of the settings of the operating point at which the EMVA 1288 measurements have been acquired. Settings not specified are assumed to be in the factory default mode. This ensures that the measurements can be repeated anytime under the same conditions.\n\nThe photon transfer curve shows the variance of the image sensor noise versus the mean value. For an ideal linear camera this curve should be linear. Only if the lower 70% of the curve are linear, can the EMVA 1288 performance parameters be estimated accurately. If a camera has any type of deficiencies, these can often first seen in the photon transfer curve.\nThe double-logarithmic SNR curve [2b] is a nice overall graphical representation of all camera performance parameters except for the dark current.

{"id": "1600895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1600895", "title": "Francis March", "text": "Francis March\n\nFrancis Andrew March (October 25, 1825 – September 9, 1911), was an American polymath, academic, philologist, and lexicographer. He is considered the principal founder of modern comparative linguistics in Anglo-Saxon.\n\nAlso known as the \"Grand Old Man of Lafayette,\" March was the first individual to hold the title \"Professor of English Language and Literature\" anywhere in the United States or Europe. March is predominantly recognized for performing his duties as \"Professor of the English Language and Comparative Philology\" at Lafayette College, where he taught for fifty-six years.\n\nMarch was born on October 25, 1825, in Millbury, Massachusetts (formerly Sutton). Three years later, his family relocated to Worcester, Massachusetts. As a child, he was educated in the Worcester public school system. March recalled being grateful for the education he received in the district, explaining his kindergarten teacher \"made the children understand many things before the usual time.\" This prepared him high school, where March became a clever and active participant in his classes and activities. He became a writer, read on a wide range of subjects, performed in school plays, and even wrote plays himself.\n\nAt the age of 15, March was ready for college, but his father experienced business troubles which hindered March's ability to afford tuition. The Honorable Alfred D. Foster of Worcester, however, offered to fund a portion of his education at Amherst College. During his time in college, March maintained prominence in scholarship as well as in athletics. He graduated in 1845 as valedictorian and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He also received an M.A. degree from Amherst in 1848, with an oration on \"Relation of the Study of Jurisprudence to the Baconian Philosophy.\"\n\nMarch married Margaret Mildred Stone Conway (1837–1911) on August 12, 1860. Together they had nine children: historian Francis Andrew March Jr., Peyton C. March, Thomas Stone March, Alden March, Moncure March, John Lewis March, Mildred March, Margaret D. March, and General Peyton C. March. Francis A. March Jr. later worked at Lafayette College as a professor and became the namesake for Lafayette College's March Field. General Peyton C. March was chief of staff of the United States Army during the First World War. Meanwhile, Thomas Stone March became a superintendent of schools in Greensburg, Pennsylvania; Alden March became a Sunday editor of \"The New York Times\";and John Lewis March became a professor of modern languages at Union College in Schenectady, New York.\n\nFrancis A. March died on a Saturday afternoon on September 9, 1911 at the age of 86 in his home on Lafayette College's campus. He is buried in Easton Cemetery in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. On December 30, 1913 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, his colleague, Professor James Bright, delivered a commemoration in his honor at the Joint Session of the American Philological Association and the Modern Language Association.\n\nImmediately following his graduation from Amherst, March began teaching at an academy in Swanzey, New Hampshire. He then taught for two years at Leicester Academy, where he began formulating his plan to teach English and literature. From 1847 to 1848, he was a tutor at his alma mater.\n\nMarch also expressed an interest in law. In 1849, he entered as a law student for the office of Barney and Butler. A year later, March was admitted to the New York bar. He began practicing the profession with partner Gordon L. Ford Esq. However, in 1852, March experienced severe health issues. He suffered a hemorrhage of the lungs and was rushed to Cuba in an attempt to alleviate the problem, given Cuba's gentler climate. The climate aided March's health and allowed him to resume work the following year, in which he secured a position teaching law at a private academy in Fredericksburg, Virginia for three years.\n\nAfter studying law and teaching, March became an English tutor at Lafayette College in 1856, appointed by the college's new president George Wilson McPhail. He worked for one year as a tutor and then became a professor of English Language and Comparative Philology from 1857 to 1907. Lafayette was the first college in the world to have the philology of the English language studied – a course all American colleges soon thereafter incorporated into their own curricula. March was the first to hold the title of \"Professor of English Language and Literature\" anywhere in the United States or Europe. He also occupied the chair of English Language and Comparative Philology, and served as the first librarian of the college.\n\nMarch had a significant career at Lafayette College and remained loyal to the school, often turning down offers from larger universities as his published work and teaching style became more well-known. March helped improve Lafayette by using his wisdom and insight to bring the college to a new stage of prestigious education. He was devoted to both increasing the analysis of English literature in higher institutions, as well as in growing the college's academics. In addition to English, March also taught French, German, Greek, Latin, botany, \"mental philosophy\", political economy, critical examination of the US Constitution, public law and Roman law.\n\nMarch brought a new outlook to teaching English by introducing a detailed examination of linguistic and rhetorical pieces. By applying the methods of studying Latin and Greek classics towards the study of English literature, he led the way for the first scientific study of the English language. March is also said to be the first person to include one of Shakespeare's plays on his course syllabus. March had a pedagogical philosophy and unique approach to the systematic study of the English language. His outlook was “the greatest pioneering step ever made in the realm of scholarship by Lafayette College.\" One of his most distinct analytical contributions was his philology-across-the-curriculum approach in which \"professors train the students in each department to write on subjects connected with it in the words and phrases current among experts.\" \n\nMarch had a son who also became an English professor at Lafayette and they worked alongside each other. By dedicating most of his life to Lafayette College, the ideas that Francis A. March presented about systematic study became a part of the college's philosophy of education that still holds to this day.\n\nOutside of teaching, Francis A. March contributed to many advancements in philology. He contributed to over 200 periodical publications in philology, the historical study of grammar, the teaching of literature, and pedagogy. In addition, he published four volumes of Latin and Greek classics. In 1869, he published what is considered to be his masterpiece, “A Comparative Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Language.” This work gained him recognition as a distinguished scholar in the philological world. From 1873 to 1874, and again from 1895 to 1896, he served as the president of the American Philological Association. Later, in 1903 he published \"A Thesaurus Dictionary of the English Language.\" \n\nMarch was one of the chief reformers in the spelling of English words. He believed in simpler spellings. In his writings, he often spelled words phonetically to emphasize his passion for spelling reform. In 1876, he became the permanent President of the Spelling Reform Association. He remained president until 1906.\n\nMarch also pursued an interest in Lexicography. This may have stemmed from his connection with Noah Webster. March initially heard Webster speak while he was a student at Amherst College. He also studied under Webster's son-in-law, William Chauncey Fowler. Webster's Dictionary also had a strong impact on March. March aligned with the premise that spelling, grammar, and usage should be based on the spoken word. March was the first American superintendent over the volunteer reading program of the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", thus providing valuable support to James Murray in the compilation of this monumental work. He also served as the consulting editor of Funk and Wagnalls' Standard Dictionary from 1879 to 1892.\n\nMarch left an impactful and lasting legacy on the Lafayette College and Easton-area communities, as well as on the broader academic community.\n\nMarch worked at Lafayette College for more than fifty years, passing up opportunities at other institutions in order to continue to study, teach, and publish at the small liberal arts school. While praised for his hard work, March was also remembered for being the first academic in the country to study and teach English texts in the same manner professors taught Greek and Latin classics. His examination of the English language led Lafayette College to set up the first chair at any college in the United States for the study of English texts from a modern viewpoint. To this day, Lafayette College has a chaired professorship in March's honor. Lafayette College also has a Francis A. March Fellowship that is awarded to a senior who has excelled in the English department and has been accepted into a graduate school approved by the college's English department. Beyond his professional impact, colleague James A. Bright, also commented on how March personally shaped the Lafayette College community. Bright spoke highly of the way in which March built relationships with faculty and served as a mentor to students.\n\nMarch's lasting legacy can also be seen in the wider Easton-area community, where an elementary school is named in his honor. Francis A. March Elementary School in the College Hill Residential Historic District is part of the Easton Area School District, which serves Northampton County.\n\nThe wider academic community has also recognized the value of March's contributions and work. Each year, the Modern Language Association gives two distinguished scholar-teachers awards named after Francis A. March. Additionally, the Association of Departments of English has established the Francis Andrew March Award to recognize and honor scholars who have made paramount contributions to the study of English.\n\nFrancis A. March's monumental works have been highly recognized in academia. March was the first to hold the title of “Professor of English Language and Literature” in both the United States and Europe. This appointment was \"the greatest pioneering step ever made in the realm of scholarship by Lafayette College,\" as described in the Skillman biography of the college.\n\nHe was elected President of the Modern Language Association from 1891 to 1893, President of the American Philological Association from 1873 to 1893 and 1895 to 1896, President of the Spelling Reform Association of 1876 to 1905, and was the Vice President of London's New Shakespeare Society.\n\nMarch was also the first American member of London's Philosophical Society and Paris's L’Association Fonetique de Professeurs de Langues Vivants.\n\nOn October 21, 1881, March was elected into the American Antiquarian Society. Members are elected by their colleagues for their tremendous contributions and discoveries within academia.\n\nDuring his fifty-six-year career at Lafayette College, March received several honorary degrees from world-renowned academic institutions. In 1870, Princeton University awarded March with the degree of Legum Doctor (LL.D). In 1887, Columbia University commemorated March with the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters (D.H.L.).\n\nIn 1896, he was awarded both the degree of Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) from the University of Oxford, as well as the degree of Doctor of Letters (Litt.D) from the University of Cambridge. At this time, March was one of only six people to ever be honored with such prestigious accolades by these universities.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47877627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47877627", "title": "John J. Albright", "text": "John J. Albright\n\nJohn Joseph Albright (1 January 1848 Buchanan, Virginia – 20 August 1931 Buffalo, New York) was a businessman, philanthropist, and one of Buffalo's leading socialites at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nAlbright was born on January 18, 1848, in Buchanan, Virginia, to Joseph Jacob Albright and Elizabeth S. Albright, both from Pennsylvania. The family was descended from Andrew Albright, a gunsmith who supplied arms to the troops of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, who had come to America in 1750. Albright's father, Joseph, was an iron manufacturer and eventually, President of the First National Bank, coal agent for Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad.\n\nHis family lived in Scranton, Pennsylvania when he was a child and he attended public schools in Scranton, then Williston Academy in Massachusetts, ultimately graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York with a degree in Mining Engineering in 1868.\n\n Following his graduation from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Albright returned to Scranton. At that time, coal was in high demand in the Western United States, and Albright got involved in its sale. By 1871, Albright was working out of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania selling coal wholesale, along with his business partner, Andrew Langdon (1835-1919). Their firm was called Langdon, Albright and Company. By 1873, Albright had married Langdon's sister, Harriet, and they all moved to Washington, D.C., where Albright and Langdon started to work for the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company.\n\nWhile in Washington, Albright started an asphalt business with his brother-in-law, Amzi L. Barber (who had married his wife's sister, Julia Louise Langdon). Together Barber and Albright participated in the paving of Washington, Scranton, and Buffalo. While Albright turned to other ventures, Barber continued with the asphalt business and secured a 42-year monopoly concession from the British Government for the Pitch Lake in Trinidad, the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world. Barber used the asphalt from Trinidad for paving city streets and by 1900, Barber had laid over 12 million square yards of Trinidad asphalt pavement in 70 American cities at a cost of $35 million.\n\nIn 1883, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company tightened its shipping routes and started shipping coal directly by rail through Buffalo, New York to ship their coal to the west. Albright moved his family to Buffalo to oversee the operations. While there, he entered into partnership with Thomas Guilford Smith, another RPI graduate and Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company executive. Their firm, Albright & Smith, handled all of Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company's coal sales in Canada and Western New York, as well as all the Railroad's coal going westward from Buffalo. Albright devised a plan to fill up the empty trains with grain on the haul back to the East. Purportedly, within a year, he had earned $100,000 ().\n\nBy 1888, Albright had done so well that he decided to retire and took his family on a 14-month tour of Europe and Egypt when he was only 40 years old. Albright, however, tired of retirement and started working again upon his return. By 1889, Albright's business partner, Smith had become a sales agent for Carnegie, Phipps & Company Limited which later merged with The Carnegie Steel Company, of which Smith was its Buffalo representative.\n\nIn 1890 the US Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company and its subsidiary Cataract Company formed the International Niagara Commission composed of experts, to analyze proposals to harness Niagara Falls on the US/Canada border to generate power. They settled electricity (alternating current) as being the preferred transmission method and, after going through many proposals, in 1893 they awarded the generating contract to Westinghouse Electric with further transmission lines and transformer contracts awarded to General Electric. Work began in 1893 and in November 1896, power generated from Niagara Falls at the Edward Dean Adams Power Plant was being sent to Buffalo, New York as well as the plants of the Pittsburgh Reduction Company which needed large quantities of cheap electricity for smelting aluminum.\nA similar set of events were happening on the Canadian side of the falls. In June 1887, recognizing an opportunity, the Ontario Power Company of Niagara Falls was incorporated in Canada \"to supply manufacturers, corporations, and persons with water, hydraulic, electric or other power.\" While its operations were in Queen Victoria Park in Niagara Falls, Ontario, its executive office was in Buffalo with the following officers: Albright, president; Francis V. Greene, vice-president; and Robert C. Board, secretary and treasurer.\n\nIn 1903, the Company obtained an agreement with the Commissioners of the Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park that allowed the company to develop at least 180,000 horsepower of electricity. The company built its hydroelectric generating plant, which opened in 1905, at the base of the Horseshoe Falls just above river level. The plant had 15 generators which produced 203,000 horsepower of electric power. In 1904, Albright hired Buffalo architect E. B. Green to design the \"Ontario Power Company\" buildings, Murray Street at Buchanan Avenue, including the Entrance Pavilion, Spillway Building, Office & Transformer Station, Gate House, Screen House, and ‘’Ontario Power Company Generating Station\" at river level.\n\nThe hydroelectric generating plant worked by allowing water to enter the generating station from an inlet located one mile upstream of Niagara Falls, near Dufferin Islands, and was then brought to the plant through buried conduit pipes and steel penstocks tunneled through the rock. The conduits, two steel and one wooden (bound with iron hoops and encased in cement), ran underground 6,180 feet (1,884 meters) to the top of the generating station. There, each conduit connected with six penstocks, six feet in diameter. At the point where the conduits and the penstocks join, there was a section which turned upwards into a spillway, called a surge tank. The surge tanks served to reduce fluctuations in heat and pressure during both the increase and decrease of loads. The open spillways sent any excess water to the Niagara River if the load suddenly reduced, which prevented any unwanted rise in pressure.\n\nFrom the distributing station, the transmission lines carried power at 60,000 volts each with a capacity of 40,000 kilowatts, running over a right of way that was 300 feet wide and 32,000 feet long. This ran north to an area down the Niagara River known as Devil's Hole, where they then crossed the Niagara River into New York State across a 1,300 feet long span. In addition to the high tension feeders, there were approximately 30 miles of lines serving Canadian customers at generator voltage.\n\nThe power that was transmitted to New York State was then sold in bulk to Niagara Lockport and Ontario Power Company, a New York company, which was then distributed to individual customers. The largest individual consumers of power from these lines included several entities with direct ties to Albright: The Lackawanna Steel Company, Empire State Railway, New York Central Railroad, the Shenandoah Steel Wire Company, the Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway Company, the Lockport Gas and Electric Light Company, the Auburn Light Heat and Power Company, the Erie Railroad Company, and the Genesee County Electric Light Power and Gas Company.\n\nThe plant continued to operate until 1999 when the Ontario Power Generation (formerly Ontario Hydro) decommissioned the Ontario Power Company Generating Station from service in order to accommodate the construction of Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort, built on the former transformer building location. As of 2015, the 1905 remaining Generating Station is owned by the Niagara Parks Commission, and sits abandoned.\n\nIn 1905, a syndicate headed by Albright and Henry Herman Westinghouse (brother of George Westinghouse) acquired control Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power Company from Joseph G. Robin and his associates. The purchasing syndicate included: Albright, Westinghouse, New York Central, Vanderbilt interests, and Horace E. Andrews, of Cleveland (president of the New York State Railways, the Mohawk Valley Company, the Rochester Railway & Light Company, director of the New York Central Railway, the Michigan Central Railway, West Shore Railway, Schenectady Railway Company, Havana Railway, Light & Power Company), among others.\n\nBy 1908, the company had approximately 400 miles of transmission lines running from Devil's Hole through Lockport and Rochester to Syracuse, a total distance of 167 miles from the distributing station. It had branch lines running to West Seneca, Batavia, Caledonia, Avon, Auburn, and Baldwinsville near Syracuse. The right of way for the lines was owned by the company and was 300 ft. in width from the Niagara River to Lockport, 200 ft. from Lockport to Rochester, and 75 ft. the remainder of the way to Syracuse. The company also leased a right of way on the West Shore Railroad from near Akron to Syracuse. In January 1918, Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power Company acquired the Salmon River Power Company, which operated their own hydroelectric power plant in Salmon River (New York) on the shore of Lake Ontario.\n\nLater in 1943, the Niagara, Lockport and Ontario Power Company reorganized as the Niagara Hudson Company, Inc., and became a subsidiary of Niagara Hudson Power Corporation which was a conglomerate of 59 separate power companies in Western New York formed in 1929 and in 1932, was the \"nation's largest electric utility company\". In 1950, Niagara Hudson Power Corporation reorganized as the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation and in January 2002, Niagara Mohawk was acquired by, and became a subsidiary of, National Grid plc.\n\n In 1889, Lackawanna Iron and Steel Company, at the time the largest steel company in the world, decided to move its facilities out of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Lackawanna was looking to move away from Scranton, Pennsylvania because of increases in union labor cost and lack of railroad access to the company's newly emerging markets in the West. They were drawn to Western New York by the area's easy access to the Great Lakes and the numerous rail lines in the area.\n\nLackawanna Company executives reached out to Buffalo attorney John G. Milburn, who brought in Albright. Albright had been discussing organizing a steel plant in Buffalo with William A. Rogers (vice-president of Rogers, Brown & Company, the largest pig iron dealer in the United States), he asked that Rogers be brought into negotiations as well as Brig. Gen. Edmund B. Hayes (a civil engineer and businessman with the Union Bridge Company).\n\nTo avoid speculation, the company employed Albright to purchase land on its behalf. In March 1899, the Company’s executives met with Albright, Milburn, and Rogers (Hayes was in Jekyll Island at the time, but returned April 1) in Buffalo and explored several sites, ultimately choosing the undeveloped shoreline on Lake Erie in what was then the western part of the Town of West Seneca, New York. Albright began purchasing land on April 1, 1899, and by the end of the month had obtained nearly all the required property for a price of $1,095,430.98 (). Albright was often accompanied on his purchasing visits by Milburn, the president of the Pan-American Exposition, and at the time, many property owners assumed the land purchases were for the Exposition which helped them obtain the land at a more reasonable price.\n\nIn 1900, construction on the massive steel mill started and in 1902, the company, of which Albright was then a principal shareholder, was reorganized as the Lackawanna Steel Company. The company moved their headquarters to the site and the plant began operation in 1903, By 1909, the residents of the area voted to split off from West Seneca and formed the present day city of Lackawanna, New York, named after the Company. The Lackawanna Steel Company received its power from Albright’s Niagara Lockport and Ontario Power Company and he served as a director of the Lackawanna Steel Company, which remained independent until 1922, when it was acquired by Bethlehem Steel.\n\nIn 1892, New York Central Railroad chose the Depew, New York area (which straddles the towns of Lancaster and Cheektowaga and lies to the east of Buffalo, New York) as a permanent location for its shops and auxiliary establishments. At the time, there was only minimal infrastructure in the area.\n\nChauncey Depew, attorney for Cornelius Vanderbilt’s railroad interests and President of New York Central Railroad, formed the Depew Investment Company and purchased 1,000 acres of land north and south of the tracks for their enterprise. The original shareholders included Albright, George Urban, Wilson S. Bissell and Charles Gould. The officers of the Company were Albright as president and James A. Roberts as secretary. The area was eventually called \"Depew\" in honor of Chauncey Depew.\n\nAlbright worked closely with Frederick Law Olmsted to structure the nucleus of the town. In 1896, the Depew Improvement Company built a brick building at the corner of Transit and Ellicott (now Walden) for a bank, community center and village hall. The Company donated land for the German Lutheran Church, St. Peter and St.Paul, St. James, the Northside Fire House, Depew Village Park, and a YMCA. The company built streets, houses and the sewer system.\n\nIn 1897, Albright and Edmund B. Hayes bought Buffalo Bolt Company, which George C. Bell had founded in 1859. Buffalo Bolt produced nuts and bolts that were used by manufacturers in the production of automobiles, ships, trains, household appliances, and hundreds of other products. Under Albright, production increased many times over. In 1869, Buffalo Bolt produced 14,000 nuts and bolts per day, and by 1911, the Company was producing 1,250,000 per day. By 1920, Buffalo Bolt was producing 600,000,000 pieces of bolts, nuts, and screws as well as 5,000 varieties of finished products and 50,000 tons of steel rolled.\n\nIn 1921, the company's main factory was located at 101 East Avenue in North Tonawanda, New York, the general offices were in Buffalo, and the western offices were at 934 Monadnock Building in Chicago, IL and 1107 Chemical Building in St Louis, Mo. The officers were: Albright, president; R. K. Albright (Albright's son) and Ralph Plumb, vice presidents; G. A. Mitchell, treasurer; Robert C. Board, secretary. The Board of Directors was composed of: Albright, R. K. Albright, Edmund B. Hayes, Ralph Plumb, G. A. Mitchell, W. P. Cooke, and Anson Conger Goodyear (son of Charles W. Goodyear).\n\nThe need for workers was so great that company paid the costs associated with passage to America to bring Polish and Slovakian immigrants to the United States to work in their plant in North Tonawanda. The company built a company store and assisted employees with obtaining housing, with many employees settling in the Oliver Street area of North Tonawanda. \"The Buffalo Bolt Company\", which employed up to 1,500 people at its peak, closed at the end of June 1959.\n\nIn 1903, Albright’s former brother in law, Amzi L. Barber, was in debt to the extent of $500,000 (). He had started the Locomobile automobile company in 1899 and to keep the company afloat, he surrendered two real estate deals to Albright, who agreed to endorse $300,000 worth of Locomobile commercial paper and give Barber an annuity of $12,000 (). He also paid the remaining $100,000 Barber still owed. Unfortunately, the company did not recover financially and was eventually liquidated in 1922, where it was acquired by William C. Durant of Durant Motors to compete against Rolls Royce and Pierce-Arrow (manufactured in Buffalo).\n\nAlbright, along with Edmund B. Hayes and Stephen M. Clement, had invested in William A. Rogers’ \"Rogers, Brown & Company\" subsidiary, \"The Iroquois Iron Company\", in South Chicago, Illinois, which owned a plant containing two blast furnaces.\n\nIn 1904, Rogers invited Albright, Hayes and Clement to accompany him on one of his periodic visits, as they had not seen the property before. Purportedly, Frank H. Goodyear, another Buffalo businessman, heard of the trip and offered the use of his private car for the occasion. Rogers accepted and invited Goodyear and his brother Charles W. Goodyear to join the party. Goodyear was so impressed with the capacity of the plant to produce tonnage that he wanted one established on the line of the Goodyear brother’s \"Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad\". Rogers and the Goodyear Brothers joined forces to create a company and plant in Buffalo that was called the Buffalo and Susquehanna Iron Company, named after the Goodyear brother’s Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad.\n\nSoon after, the \"Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad\", the \"Buffalo and Susquehanna Iron Company\", the \"Pennsylvania Railroad\", and the \"Lackawanna Steel Company\" jointly built a giant ship canal on the border of Buffalo and Lackawanna called the \"Union Ship Canal\". The canal, used by all parties, allowed room for steamships to bring in iron ore from Michigan and Minnesota to be reduced to pig iron. The \"Union Ship Canal\"'s continued to be used as an industrial waterway until January 1982 with the closure of the Hanna Blast Furnace.\n\nIn May 1893, Albright, along with George V. Forman, John Satterfield, and Franklin D. Locke, founded The Fidelity Trust and Guaranty Company of Buffalo, New York. In 1909, E. B. Green was commissioned to build the \"Fidelity Trust Building\", today known as \"Swan Tower\" and owned by Ellicott Development Co., located at 284 Main Street in Buffalo.\n\nIn December 1925, the Fidelity Trust Company, with $35 million in assets, merged with Manufacturers and Traders Bank, founded in 1856, with $64 million in assets, under the new name Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company. The $100 million company was headed by Fidelity's President, 36-year-old Lewis G. Harriman. Harriman and a group of investors including A. H. Schoellkopf, from the founding family of the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company, and James Forrestal, who would become the first United States Secretary of Defense, owned enough shares to control both Fidelity and M&T.\n\nIn 1908, separate from his involvement with The Fidelity Trust and Guaranty Company, Albright served as vice president of Marine Bank's Board of Directors, along with Stephen M. Clement (president), Charles W. Goodyear (founder of the Great Southern Lumber Company), William H. Gratwick (founder of the lumber firm of Gratwick, Smith & Fryer Lumber Co.), Edmund B. Hayes (civil engineer and businessman with the Union Bridge Company), William H. Hotchkiss (a lawyer with Hotchkiss & Bush and later State Superintendent of Insurance), Edward H. Hutchinson (of Maerz Lithographing Co.), Charles H. Keep (secretary of the Lake Carriers' Association and of the Buffalo Merchants' Exchange), John H. Lascelles (director of the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad), George B. Mathews (Partner at Schoellkopf & Mathews flour mill), Moses Taylor, and Cornelius Vanderbilt III. Albright served as President of Marine National Bank of Buffalo and later as director of the Marine Trust Company.\n\nIn 1890, Albright hired E. B. Green of Green & Wicks to design the Albright Memorial Building in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in honor of his parents. The building, also known as \"Scranton Public Library,\" was completed in early 1893 and is a two-story, \"L\"-shaped, Indiana limestone and Medina sandstone building with Châteauesque-style design elements. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\nIn 1892, Albright helped found the Nichols School by bringing William Nichols to Buffalo to set up the school, and supported the \"Elmwood School\" (which merged with the Franklin School in 1941 to form the Elmwood Franklin School), the oldest independent school in Western New York, founded in 1889. In 1904, he donated the land for the Unitarian Universalist Church of Buffalo and gave significant donations to the South Park Botanical Gardens.\n\nHis largest gift was in 1900 when he made a donation of $350,000 () so that the then ‘’Fine Arts Academy\", founded in 1862, could have a permanent home. The building was designed by prominent architect Green and was originally intended to be used as the Fine Arts Pavilion for the Pan-American Exposition in 1901, but delays in its construction and increased costs (the total cost was purported to be closer to $1,000,000 ()) caused it to remain uncompleted until 1905, when it opened as the Albright Art Gallery. The Pan-American Exposition was held in Buffalo from May 1, 1901 through November 2, 1901.\n\nGreen designed the gallery along the lines of a Greek temple and included 102 columns, more than any other American structure except the Capitol Building in Washington. The building was constructed using 5,000 tons of white marble from a Maryland quarry, the same marble used in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhen the Gallery opened on May 31, 1905, Harvard University President, Charles William Eliot, gave the keynote address and four city choral organizations performed together. Richard Watson Gilder read a poem he had written celebrating the gallery's opening. Albright, however, did not give a speech or appear in any photographs from the ceremony as he had always been inclined to avoid the spotlight. Birge Albright, his grandson, said that Albright took friends to the gallery on Sundays when there were few others around.\n\nIn 1872, Albright married Harriet Langdon (1847–1895), the sister of his business partner, Andrew Langdon. Harriet and Andrew were first cousins with Olivia Langdon Clemens (1845–1904), the wife of Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835–1910), also known as Mark Twain. Olivia, who was originally from a wealthy family in Elmira, New York, and Twain lived in Buffalo from 1869 to 1871 where Twain owned a stake in the \"Buffalo Express\" newspaper and worked as an editor and writer. Together, John and Harriet had three children together, all born in Washington D.C.: Raymond King Albright, Ruth Albright, and Langdon Albright.\n\nIn 1895, Susan Fuller (1868–1928) was brought to Buffalo to educate the three Albright children. In March 1897, within two years of her arrival in Buffalo, 28-year-old Susan (daughter of Eben and Nancy Fuller) married 49-year-old Albright. Fuller was a recent Smith College graduate from Lancaster, Massachusetts. The couple honeymooned at the Jekyl Island Club. Together, John and Susan had five children: John \"Jack\" Joseph Albright Jr., Elizabeth \"Betty\" Albright, Fuller Albright, Nancy Albright, and Susan \"Susy\" Albright.\n\nIn 1915, Albright and two of his daughters, were painted by Edmund Charles Tarbell. The oil painting, entitled \"John J. Albright and His Daughters\", is owned by the Westmoreland Museum of American Art in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. Tarbell also painted a portrait of Albright that is currently at the Albright-Knox gallery.\n\nJohn J. Albright died on August 20, 1931, at the age of 83, six weeks after an intestinal operation. He is buried with his family at the Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo.\n\nAlbright was elected a director of The Buffalo Fine Arts Academy in 1887, served as president from 1895 to 1897, and remained on the Board until 1910. He was also a member Jekyll Island Club from 1890 until his death in 1931. He was a member of the American Academy in Rome, the Buffalo Club, the University Club of Buffalo, the Country Club of Buffalo, and Delta Phi. In April 1926, Albright sold many valuable paintings and works of art, including: a Mauve, a Jacque, two by Diaz, a Claus, a Troyon, and others by André Crochepierre, Louis Adan, Abbott H. Thayer and a Lawrence portrait of George IV, at the Anderson Galleries in New York City as a gift to Buffalo. In February 1929, the University at Buffalo conferred upon Albright the Chancellor’s Medal, its highest honor, recognition of his achievements throughout his life.\n\nAlbright's second wife, Susan, was a member of the \"Board of Women Managers' Entertainment & Ceremony\" sub-committee and the ‘’Committee on Fine Arts\" for the Pan American Exposition. Susan died on June 19, 1928.\n\nIn 1887, Albright acquired the Wadsworth's House, former mayor of Buffalo, at 730 West Ferry in Buffalo. In 1890 he hired the Olmsted Firm to design the grounds. When the house was destroyed by fire in 1901, he hired Green & Wicks to design a new Tudor style home. The Olmsted's work for Albright continued until 1907.\n\nE. B. Green designed the new Albright mansion after the manor house of St. Catherine's Court in Bath England. A former neighbor of the Albrights recalled, \"It was a huge house. It was not unlike the Rand House on Delaware\". When the property was first built, the streets Tudor Place and St. Catherine's Court did not exist. The property had a red brick wall that surrounded the estate. Local writer Edwine Noye Mitchell wrote that the gray stone house, was surrounded \"by terraces where the crocus and scilla pushed up between the flagstones in the spring, and the pink magnolia blossoms lay thick over the grass from the sidewalk.\n\nThe Albrights' property ran from 690 to 770 West Ferry and extended from West Ferry to Cleveland Avenue on at least 12 acres of land. In 1935, the Albright house on West Ferry was demolished and the estate was sold in multiple parcels for homes to be built on. Green salvaged the stone balustrade from the terrace and had it reinstalled in front of Lockwood Library at the University of Buffalo's Main Street campus soon after. A wrought iron gate, known today as \"Queen Anne's Gate\" and which still stands sentinel outside of the property.\n\nIn February 1914, Albright and his second wife Susan, purchased the 26 room Joseph Pulitzer Cottage, in Jekyl Island, in Georgia, fully furnished, after spending many winters on the island with their family. While there, the Albrights struck up a friendship with the poet laureate of England, Alfred Noyes and his wife, who visited them in Jeykl Island in 1914. Albright introduced Noyes to William Rockefeller and other Jekyl Islanders who were at the club. The house was sold in 1931 after Albrights death and when the State of Georgia acquired the entire Jekyl Island in 1947, the cottage was still standing. In 1951, a fire damaged the interior and on June 23, 1951, the cottage was demolished as there were no funds were available to repair the damage.\n"}

It is the most detailed and precise surviving chronicle of the activities of one individual \"Einsatzkommando\", and a key record documenting the Holocaust in Lithuania as well as in Latvia and Belarus.\n\nThe Jäger Report is a tally sheet of actions by \"Einsatzkommando\" 3, including the \"Rollkommando\" Hamann killing squad. The report keeps an almost daily running total of the murders of 137,346 people, the vast majority Jews, from 2 July 1941 to 25 November 1941. The report documents date and place of the massacres, number of victims and their breakdown into categories (Jews, communists, criminals, etc.). In total, there were 112 executions in 71 different locations in Lithuania, Latvia, and Belarus. On 17 occasions, daily casualties exceeded 2,000 people. On 9 February 1942, in a handwritten note for Franz Walter Stahlecker, Jäger updated the totals to 138,272 people: 136,421 Jews (46,403 men, 55,556 women and 34,464 children), 1,064 communists, 653 mentally disabled, and 134 others. The report concluded that Lithuania was now free of Jews except for about 34,500 Jews concentrated in Vilnius, Kaunas and Šiauliai Ghettos. However, Jäger Report did not tally all Jewish deaths in Lithuania as it did not include executions by \"Einsatzkommando\" 2 in Šiauliai area (approx. 46,000 people), in some border areas (for example, in Šakiai on September 13, Kudirkos Naumiestis on September 19, Kretinga in July–August, Gargždai on June 24, 1941), or even in Vilnius (for example, the report is missing the October 1 (Yom Kippur) massacre of some 4,000 Jews).\n\nThe nine-page report was prepared in five copies, but only one survives and is kept by the Special Archive, part of the in Moscow. The copy was discovered in 1944 when Red Army recaptured Lithuania, but it was not made known to scholars or the judiciary evaluating Nazi war crimes. Only in 1963, during the \"in absentia\" trial of Hans Globke in East Germany and four years after Jäger's suicide, Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs disclosed the document to the German Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes. The document was first published in a Lithuanian collection of documents \"Masinės žudynės Lietuvoje\" in 1965 and in Western press by in 1972 as a facsimile.\n\n"}

In particular the administration did not feel as though the yearbook should have a section with current events and they did not like the fact that the school colors were not on the yearbook.\n\nCharles Kincaid and Carpi Coffer filed suit on behalf of the students against the university. Initially the lower courts ruled in favor of the school using the \"Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier\" case as an example of how students can be censored by school administrations. Eventually the case made it all the way to the Sixth Court of Appeals. After failing to win a decision the students appealed to have the circuit court rule \"en banc\".\n\nThe court heard the case on Jan. 5, 2001 and by a 10-3 decision decided for the students. This is significant because the court made it clear that the \"Hazelwood\" case should not be applied to the college media.\n\nIn March 2001, the students and KSU settled with money and attorney's fees changing hands to the students.

The CCF was a democratic socialist party founded in 1932 by farmers, workers and socialist groups against the backdrop of the Great Depression.\n\nThe Manifesto was largely written by members of the League for Social Reconstruction, particularly Frank Underhill and F.

It called for a planned economy and a national banking system that would be \"removed from the control of private profit-seeking interests.\" It advocated the ability to organize in trade unions and called for a National Labour Code \"to secure for the worker maximum income and leisure, insurance covering illness, accident, old age, and unemployment.\" The Regina Manifesto proposed social service programs such as publicly funded health care, supported peace, promoted co-operative enterprises and vowed that \"No C.C.F.

{"id": "2466490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2466490", "title": "Relational aggression", "text": "Relational aggression\n\nRelational aggression or alternative aggression is a type of aggression in which harm is caused by damaging someone's relationships or social status. Although it can be used in many contexts and among different age groups, relational aggression among adolescents in particular, has received a lot of attention. \n\nThe attention relational aggression has received has been augmented by the help of popular media, including movies like \"Mean Girls\" and books like \"Odd Girl Out\" by R. Simmons (2003), Nesthäkchen and the World War by Else Ury (1916), and \"Queen Bees and Wannabes\" by R. Wiseman (2003). Relational aggression can have various lifelong consequences. Relational aggression has been primarily observed and studied among girls, following pioneering research by psychologist Nicki R. Crick.\n\nA person's peers become increasingly significant in adolescence and are especially important for adolescents' healthy psychological development. Peers provide many new behavioral models and feedback that are essential for successful identity formation and for the development of one's sense of self. Interactions with peers encourage positive practice of autonomy and independent decision-making skills. They are also essential for healthy sexual development including the development of the capacity for intimate friendships and learning appropriate sexual behavior. Peer relationships are also very important for determining how much adolescents value school, how much effort they put into it, and how well they perform in class.\nHowever, quite frequently adolescents take part in peer relationships that are harmful for their psychological development. Adolescents tend to form various cliques and belong to different crowds based on their activity interests, music and clothing preferences, as well as their cultural or ethnic background. Such groups differ in their sociometric or popularity status, which often create unhealthy, aggression-victimization based dynamics between groups. Different forms of aggression can also be used to control dynamics and sociometric status within a group. Sometimes aggression is directed to an individual rather than to any apparent social group. Primary reasons for victimization include looks and speech; adolescents are also frequently bullied because of a disability, particular ethnicity, or religion.\n\nRelational aggression is defined as a type of aggression that is \"intended to harm others through deliberate manipulation of their social standing and relationships\". Relational aggression, according to Daniel Olweus is a type of bullying. Bullying in general, is defined as physically or psychologically violent re-occurring and not provoked acts, where the bully and victim have unequal physical strength or/and psychological power. These key conditions apply to all types of bullying: verbal, physical, relational.\n\nRelational aggression may be either covert or direct, and is distinct from other forms of indirect aggression.\nIt can be proactive (planned and goal-oriented) or reactive (in response to perceived threats, hostility, or anger), and it can be, for instance, peer-directed or romantic.\nSeveral studies have indicated substantive differences between proactive and reactive relational aggression. Reactive aggression is associated with a tendency to assume that others' intentions are hostile (hostile attribution bias).\n\nMost studies of relational aggression have involved children or adolescents; the study of relational aggression in adults presents problems. Relational aggression is a common aspect of workplace bullying, and is a characteristic behaviour of psychopaths in the workplace, so it is commonplace amongst adults as well as children.\n\nManifestations of relational aggression include:\n\nPsychological manipulation and coercion can also be considered as a type of relational aggression.\n\nMost recent research has been focusing on cyber-bullying, which is a relatively new yet increasingly popular way of engaging in both verbal and relational aggression due to growing importance of various communication and technology devices in modern societies. Some studies show that internet meanness is more common among girls than boys.\n\nMany studies in the U.S. and Europe show that at least 30% of students report having been bullied in one or another way. Some studies indicate even higher percentages of victimization. Bullying in schools happens in all forms and at various ages, although peer bullying has the highest prevalence in 6th-8th grades. The most common forms of bullying are verbal with relational, or various forms of ostracism, coming in second.\n\nAlthough it can be used by both genders, relational aggression is more commonly associated with girls. Findings of a study by Rivers and Smith have shown that while verbal aggression occurs with similar frequency in both sexes, direct physical aggression is more common among boys and indirect aggression is more common among girls. In another study by Baldry it was found that boys are more likely to engage in bullying behaviors such as threats, physical harm, rejection, and name-calling, while girls are most likely to use name-calling, teasing, rumors, rejection, and taking personal belongings. Based on these findings, girls do seem to use relational aggression more than boys.\n\nIn addition, recent international research shows that both genders tend to use relational aggression, but girls are more aware and distressed by it. For example, a study by Horn found that girls are more likely to say that it is morally wrong to exclude someone based on their crowd membership.\n\nSome research shows that there are certain implications when boys and girls engage in gender-atypical aggression, as girls who are more physically aggressive or boys who are highly relationally aggressive are more maladjusted than their peers.\n\nSociometric status, commonly referred as popularity, is one of the most significant predictors of victimization or bullying as differences in popularity can be associated with differences in social power. It is commonly believed that aggressive adolescents belong to rejected social groups. However, some research shows that they can be popular among their peers. Rodkin et al. (2000), for example, describes two types of popular boys: \"model\" boys, who are \"physically and academically competent, friendly and neither shy nor aggressive.\" Second type is described as \"tough\" and such adolescents are \"aggressive, physically competent, and average or below average in friendliness, academic competence, and shyness.\". Usually the more popular aggressive adolescents use instrumental aggression and not reactive aggression. Instrumental aggression is defined as behavior that is deliberate and planned while reactive aggression is unplanned and impulsive.\nRelational aggression can be greatly instrumental for maintaining the popularity status of a group among other groups, as well specific relationship and status dynamics inside a group. Ojala and Nesdale (2004) found that both victims and bullies normally come from rejected groups. Bullies chose to bully students, who are members of their social out-groups that are similar to their own in- group as a result of threatened distinctiveness. Hence, the need to maintain a unique social identity and status can be one of the causes to engage in bullying.\nUsing relational aggression to maintain a particular social order inside the group has been mostly observed in girl groups: if some member of the group becomes too popular and this causes imbalance in the group, other members might start rumors about the overly popular girl to diminish her status.\nAmanda Rose (2004) claims that the main purpose of using relational aggression in first place is to enhance or maintain one's social status. Many skills that are needed to be popular are also essential for being \"successful\" at employing relational aggression, e.g. ability to \"read\" people and adjust one's behavior accordingly, etc. The researcher suggests that some aggressive boys are popular because they are also good at using relational aggression, and, therefore, their primary reason for popularity is not their physical but relational aggression.\n\nResearch shows that there are three types of rejected or unpopular adolescents who are very likely to be involved in bullying behavior. First type includes adolescents who are overly aggressive: they tend to get into fights, get involved in antisocial activities, and are often involved in bullying; second type includes adolescents who are withdrawn or timid and exceedingly shy and inhibited and who are more likely to be victims; third- aggressive- withdrawn- type adolescents tend to have trouble controlling their hostility, but they are also very shy and nervous about initiating friendships. The latter are likely to be bully-victims. Other students- bystanders can also choose between several roles: victim-defender, bully-reinforcer and/or assistant, and outsiders.\n\nVictims or the unpopular withdrawn children are excessively anxious, lack social skills needed to initiate new contacts or break into a group activity. Their lack of confidence combined with submissiveness make them perfect targets for bullying. Some of the most common underlying reasons for bullying include low socioeconomic status, disability, and obesity.\nResearch shows that in comparison with other adolescents victims often use worse problem solving strategies. They often score less than their bullies and defenders in the tests of moral competence and theory of mind. Moral competence refers to the ability to carefully consider both the consequences and prior beliefs in determining how morally right or wrong one's actions are. Victims seemed to focus primarily on the outcomes and not being as good in integrating the moral beliefs. They have difficulties in social skills, and social problem solving, as well as emotional regulation. And because of their lack of social competence, victims score low on peer acceptance and popularity. Victims are often overly sensitive to being rejected, which might originate in their relationships with parents.\n\nBullies, despite being quite morally competent, tend to engage in morally wrong behaviors because of several reasons, including a lack of moral compassion. In general, bullies seem to engage in a kind of cold cognition and have a good theory of mind. They also have an average to good social intelligence. These skills seem to be especially important in order to use relational aggression in an instrumental manner—for achieving specific social goals.\nAs mentioned previously, male and female bullies usually score differently on sociometric measures. Male bullies often fall in the socially rejected category while female bullies tend to fall in the controversial category. They can be popular yet not liked.\n\nMany unpopular aggressive kids seem to engage in hostile attributional bias when analyzing the actions of others: they are more likely to interpret other children's behavior as hostile while it is not, which can cause the perpetuation of their aggressive behaviors.\n\nBully- victims are people who have both experienced aggression directed towards them and have themselves engaged in bullying. They often choose to be bully assistants or reinforcers. Seeing others victimized can serve as a buffer against some psychological problems, for which these people are at risk (see Consequences of victimization below). In comparison to all other groups, bully-victims are the worst off regarding their psychological adjustment and problems. They are least liked among the peers.\n\nAlthough early research has mostly focused on victims and bullies, currently more and more attention has been given to the roles of other students, or bystanders: bully-reinforcer's and assistants, victim-defenders, and outsiders.\n\nBully-reinforcers and assistants do not normally initiate aggressive actions themselves, but they support, reinforce, and/or assist the bully. They often have rather large friendship networks when compared to outsiders, victims, and their defenders. These individuals are similar to bullies in regards of their personal characteristics. Female bully- reinforcers and assistants usually score low on social acceptance and high on rejection by their peers while male bully assistants have average scores on both and bully- reinforcers are often quite popular among their peers. The characteristic that is common among all these individuals across both genders is low level of empathy.\n\nVictim-defenders are individuals who stand up for the victim. They are usually popular among their peers, although occasionally rejected and victimized adolescents take on the defender's role. Defenders like to befriend other defenders and usually belong to the smallest social network of all other previously mentioned groups. Defenders have both advanced moral competence and high level of compassion. They also score high on the theory of mind tests. They are usually very morally engaged, have a high sense of responsibility, and self-efficacy. They are also good at emotion regulation.\n\nOutsiders are adolescents who like to stay away from the conflict situations, participate in spreading rumors, or actively support either side. They usually befriend other outsiders. Both male and female outsiders usually score below average on both social acceptance and rejection by their peers.\nIn general, the best predictor for whether an adolescent will choose to be a defender or an outsider in a particular situation is their relationship to the victim and/or bully. Occasionally, adolescents will feel more comfortable to intervene if they are friends of the offender. However, in general they will take the side of the bully or victim based on who they know better. Bullies are more likely to be friends of other bullies, as well as their reinforcers, and assistants, while victims befriend other victims.\n\nThere are serious negative consequences associated with being involved in any aggressive behaviors. And while problems with peers might be a result of one's poor social skills and maladjustment, difficulty making friends, and regular experience of aggression can also be a cause of many short and long term negative consequences on one's mental health and academic and professional achievements.\nExperience of relational aggression, peer rejection, and unpopularity are shown to be linked to various problems in adolescence, which are listed below:\n\nSome negative effects persist into adulthood. In a longitudinal study, Dan Olweus (2003) found that young adults, who were victims of bullying in adolescence, had more symptoms of depression and lower self-esteem than did their non-victimized peers. Victims are also much more likely to engage in heavy smoking later in life. Decreased academic engagement due to victimization can have some long term consequences as victim's lower educational attainment in adulthood leads to lower earnings.\n\nThere are differences in consequences among the children who are rejected and aggressive, also known as bully-victims, and children who are rejected and withdrawn, also referred to as simply victims. Aggressive individuals often have conduct problems and are involved in antisocial activity.; withdrawn children feel exceedingly lonely, at risk of low self-esteem, depression, and diminished social competence. Adolescents, who are both aggressive and withdrawn, are at greatest risk for various mental and behavioral problems.\n\nAlthough victims respond to bullying in various ways, some of the most common ways include avoidance or escape behaviors, such as not going to school and running away from home. However, in some extreme cases, suicide attempts might occur. Compared to non-victims, victims exhibit increased levels of suicidal ideation. and are more likely to have attempted suicide. Researcher Y.S. Kim (2005) found that there are some gender differences as victimized female but not male students were at significantly greater risk for suicidal ideation.\nFurther research has shown that increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts depend on a specific interaction between gender, frequency, and type of aggression. Relational or indirect aggression was found to be associated with depression and suicidal ideation among both genders. According to Brustein and Klomek (2007), victimization at any frequency increased the risk of depression, ideation, and attempts among girls, while only frequent victimization increased the risk of depression and ideation among males; yet, Katliala-Heino et al. (1999) found that severe ideation was associated with frequent victimization only among girls.\n\nSome adolescents are more resilient to victimization due to their personal characteristics, but there are some environmental factors such as having a best friend or great family support can decrease the risk for many negative consequences associated with victimization. In addition, research shows that support from teachers can be a significant environmental factor for higher academic achievement and school engagement. It can also increase general well- being in the classroom. Teacher attitudes towards bullying were found to moderate the extent to which victims internalize and feel distressed and express it by avoiding school and similar behavior. Close teacher- student relationship moderates perceived safety in the classroom, and higher perceived safety is directly linked to better classroom concentration and improved coping strategies. Therefore, supportive friends, family, and teachers can be great buffers for victimized students against all negative effects of victimization.\nWitnessing the harassment of others can also reduce some harmful effects of being victimized: victims-only feel more humiliated and angry than victims-witnesses on the same day. Being singled out and picked on feels worse than being one of many victimized students. This explains why in ethnically diverse schools victimized students experience worse psychological outcomes when their ethnic group is in majority, because then they are more likely to attribute it to their personal shortcomings and not to their group membership.\n\nThere are many prevention programs, which have been designed to improve social skills of the unpopular and victimized adolescents. Prevention programs usually focus on one of the three strategies:\nDifferent types of programs have shown to have somewhat different effects: the first type seems to best improve adolescent's ability to get along with others while the second type has shown to improve adolescents' self-conceptions and their acceptance by others. One of the examples of the programs using the third approach is PATHS (Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies) teaches skills needed for successfully analyzing social situations, controlling one's negative emotions, and making more rational social decisions. It has been shown to successfully reduce behavioral problems among elementary school children.\nHowever, it is difficult to prevent relational aggression from happening as often adolescents who use it are seen to be more popular among their peers.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5090709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5090709", "title": "The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care", "text": "The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care\n\nBenjamin Spock's The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care is one of the best-selling books of the twentieth century, selling 500,000 copies in the six months after its initial publication in 1946, and 50 million by the time of Spock’s death in 1998. As of 2011, the book had been translated into 39 languages.\n\nSpock and his manual helped revolutionize child-rearing methods for the post-World War II generation. Mothers heavily relied on Spock’s advice and appreciated his friendly, reassuring tone. Spock emphasizes in his book that, above all, parents should have confidence in their abilities and trust their instincts. The famous first line of the book reads, “Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do.”\n\nSpock’s book helped revolutionize child care in the 1940s and 1950s. Prior to this, rigid schedules permeated pediatric care. Influential authors like behavioral psychologist John B. Watson, who wrote \"Psychological Care of Infant and Child\" in 1928, and pediatrician Luther Emmett Holt, who wrote \"The Care and Feeding of Children: A Catechism for the Use of Mothers and Children's Nurses\" in 1894, told parents to feed babies on strict schedules and start toilet training at an early, specific age. Watson, Holt, and other child care experts obsessed over rigidity because they believed that irregularities in feeding and bowel movements were causing the widespread diarrheal diseases seen among babies in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nFurthermore, these experts, whose ideas were embodied in \"Infant Care\" pamphlets distributed by the U.S. government, warned against “excessive” affection by parents for their children. To maintain sterility and to prevent children from becoming spoiled or fussy, these experts recommended kissing children only on the forehead and limiting hugs or other displays of affection.\n\nAs a practicing pediatrician in the 1930s, Spock noticed that prevailing methods in pediatric care seemed cruel and ignored the emotional needs of the child. He wanted to explore the psychological reasons behind common problems seen during practices like breastfeeding and toilet training, in order to give less arbitrary advice to mothers who came to his practice. He thus became trained in psychoanalysis, emerging as the first pediatrician with a psychoanalytic background. Seeking useful ways to implement Freudian philosophy into child-rearing practices, Spock would try out his advice on patients and their mothers, continuously seeking their response. He contradicted contemporary norms in child care by supporting flexibility instead of rigidity and encouraging parents to show affection for their children.\n\nAlthough Spock was approached to write a child-care manual in 1938 by Doubleday, he did not yet feel certain enough of his professional abilities to accept the offer. Eventually, though, after several more years of giving advice to mothers, Spock felt more convinced of his advice and published a paperback copy of \"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care\" in 1946 with Pocket Books. His intent in writing the book was to disseminate comprehensive information to all mothers, giving advice that combined the physical and psychological aspects of child care. So that any mother could afford it, the book was sold at just twenty-five cents.\n\n\"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care\" is arranged by topics corresponding to the child’s age, ranging from infancy to teenage years. Drawn from his career as a pediatrician, Spock's advice is comprehensive, dealing with topics such as preparing for the baby, toilet training, school, illnesses, and \"special problems\" like \"separated parents\" and \"the fatherless child\".\n\nUnlike leading child care experts prior to the 1940s, Spock supports flexibility in child-rearing, advising parents to treat each child as an individual. Drawing on his psychoanalytic training, he explains the behavior and motivations of children at each stage of growth, allowing parents to make their own decisions about how to raise their children. For example, Spock has an entire chapter devoted to \"The One-Year-Old,\" in which he explains that babies at this age like to explore the world around them. He then suggests ways to arrange the house and prevent accidents with a \"wandering baby.\"\n\nSpock emphasizes that ultimately, the parents’ “natural loving care” for their children is most important. He reminds parents to have confidence in their abilities and to trust their common sense; his practice as a pediatrician had proven to him that parents' instincts were usually best.\n\nDuring Spock’s lifetime, seven editions of his book were published. Several co-authors have helped revise the book since the fifth edition. Since Spock’s death in 1998, two more editions have been published.\n\nEach subsequent edition of the book brings medical information up-to-date. Other revisions have emerged to deal with contemporary social issues, such as daycare and gay parenting.\n\nIn the second edition, Spock emphasizes in several new chapters the importance of “firm but gentle” control of children. He warns against self-demand feeding, a type of feeding that had become popular in the 1940s. Because parents were letting their baby dictate when he or she should be fed, some parents began indulging all of their child’s desires, resulting in unregulated sleep schedules and a loss of control for the parents. Spock clarifies in his manual that while parents should respect their children, they also must ask for respect in return.\n\nBy the fourth edition, Spock adapts to society’s shifting ideas of gender equality, especially after the rise of the women's liberation movement and concurrent feminist criticisms about sexism apparent in \"Baby and Child Care\". Spock changed every pronoun for the baby, previously referred to only as “he,” and discusses ways for parents to minimize gender stereotyping while raising a child. He warns against praising girls only on their appearance and notes the sexism present in a household where girls learn to do housework while boys play outside. Spock also continues to expand on the role of fathers and acknowledges that parents should have an equal share in child-rearing responsibilities, while also both having the right to work.\n\nIn the seventh edition, Spock endorses a low-fat, plant-based diet for children due to rising trends in obesity and Spock’s own switch to a macrobiotic diet after facing serious health issues.\n\nWithin a year of being published, \"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care\" had already sold 750,000 copies, mostly by word-of-mouth advertising. Mothers appreciated that Spock was not condescending in his writing and instead very empathetic towards mothers, acknowledging how tiresome child care can be. Although he believed that much of a child’s personality and behavior rested in the parents’ hands, he did not scare parents with this large responsibility of raising a \"good\" child, like earlier child care experts had. He was lauded for writing with a friendly, reassuring tone and using conversational, easy-to-read language.\n\nSpock was popularized by mentions in household magazines and famous television shows, such as \"I Love Lucy\", where the characters Lucy and Ricky Ricardo were seen consulting Spock’s manual in various episodes when seeking advice for raising their child. Spock quickly became a household name in the 1950s and is frequently credited for helping to raise a generation of “Spock babies” in the post-war period. Mothers heavily relied on his advice; by 1956, \"The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care\" was already selling a million copies each year.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, however, book sales quickly slowed due to Spock’s tarnished reputation after his publicized involvement in protests of the Vietnam War. Skepticism of his work increased, especially among colleagues, who criticized Spock for not being a serious academic researcher and relying too heavily on anecdotal evidence in his book.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Spock faced widespread criticism for condoning an overly permissive parenting style. Many commentators blamed Spock for helping to create the counterculture of the 1960s. Critics believed the current youth were rebellious and defiant in part because they had been brought up by \"Baby and Child Care\". Spock, however, continued to defend himself, saying he had always believed in firm leadership by parents.\n\nIn the 1970s, with the rise of the women's liberation movement, feminists began to publicly criticize Spock for the sexist philosophy apparent in his book. Spock was thus forced to confront his own ideas about gender roles and gender stereotyping.\n\nNear the end of his life, Spock’s changing ideas were reflected alongside technological and social changes in the seventh and final edition of his book. His advocacy for a vegan diet drew criticism from some nutritionists and pediatricians, including co-author Dr. Steven J. Parker, as being too extreme. Health and science columnist Jane Brody referenced the \"Pediatric Nutrition Handbook\" of the AAP in arguing that a vegan diet for young children could result in nutritional deficiencies unless carefully planned, something which would be difficult for working parents.\n\n\"Baby and Child Care\" popularized new ideas about child care in the years following World War II, encouraging flexibility, common sense, affection, and Freudian philosophy. Spock’s reassuring advice gave parents the confidence to use their best judgment to raise their children. Spock also masked Freudian explanations of children’s behavior in plainspoken language to avoid offending his readers, making Freud accessible to mainstream America. In 1959, \"Look\" magazine praised Spock, noting that “perhaps no other person has so influenced an entire nation’s ideas about babies…His views have brought naturalness, common sense, reassurance, Sigmund Freud and even joy to parents all over the world.”\n\nSpock’s optimistic book reflects the hopefulness of the post-war period and society’s focus on children. Because post-war affluence helped parents give children more opportunities, parents became more concerned with providing the best for their children. At the same time, the widespread move to the suburbs broke up families, increasing parents’ reliance on experts’ advice over grandparents’ advice.\n\nAlthough Spock’s reputation has changed over time, Spock continued to be a leading authority on child care until his death. In 1990, \"Life\" magazine named Spock one of the 100 most important people of the twentieth century. Upon Spock’s death in 1998, \"The New York Times\" noted that “babies do not arrive with owner’s manuals…. But for three generations of American parents, the next best thing was \"Baby and Child Care\"…Dr. Benjamin Spock…breathed humanity and common sense into child-rearing.”\n\n"}

It takes the form of a catalogue of fantasy lands, islands, cities, and other locations from world literature—\"a Baedecker or traveller's guide...a nineteenth-century gazetteer\" for mental travelling.\n\nOriginally published in 1980 and expanded in 1987 and 1999, the \"Dictionary\" covers the terrains that readers of literature would expect—Ruritania and Shangri-La, Xanadu and Atlantis, L. Frank Baum's Oz, Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, Thomas More's Utopia, Edwin Abbott's Flatland, C. S. Lewis' Narnia, and the realms of Jonathan Swift and J. R. R. Tolkien; and also a vast host of other venues, created by authors ranging from Dylan Thomas to Cervantes to Edgar Rice Burroughs, from Carl Sandburg to Rabelais to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. (Plus the Marx Brothers' \"Duck Soup,\" among other non-orthodox texts.)\n\nTo remain of manageable size, the \"Dictionary\" excludes places that are off the planet Earth (eliminating many science fiction locales), as well as \"heavens and hells and places of the future,\" and literary pseudonyms for existing places, like the Yoknapatawpha County of William Faulkner or the Barsetshire of Anthony Trollope and Angela Thirkell. It compensates by covering a wide range of anonymous and obscure sources, and volumes of forgotten lore.\n\nThe book is widely noted for the number and excellence of its illustrations, by Graham Greenfield, and its maps and charts, by James Cook. Guadalupi and Manguel acknowledge Philip Grove's \"The Imaginary Voyage in Prose Fiction\" (1941), and Pierre Versins' \"Encyclopèdie de l'Utopie, des Voyages extraordinaires et de la Science-Fiction\" (1972), as precedents and inspirations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2710126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2710126", "title": "Vampires in popular culture", "text": "Vampires in popular culture\n\nVampires in popular culture includes vampire ballet, films, literature, music, opera, theatre, paintings and video games.\n\n\n\"The Vampire\" (1913, directed by Robert G. Vignola), also co-written by Vignola, is the earliest vampire film.\n\nThese were derived from the writer Rudyard Kipling who was inspired by a vampiress painted by Philip Burne-Jones, an image typical of the era in 1897, to write his poem 'The Vampire'. Like much of Kipling's verse it was incredibly popular, and its refrain: \"A fool there was . . . \", describing a seduced man, became the title of the popular film \"A Fool There Was\" that made Theda Bara a star, the poem being used in its publicity. On this account, in early American slang the \"femme fatale\" was called a \"vamp\", short for \"vampiress\".\n\nA vampire features in the landmark \"Nosferatu\" (1922 Germany, directed by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau), an unlicensed version of Bram Stoker's \"Dracula.\" The Stoker estate sued the production and won, leading to the destruction of most copies of the film. It would be painstakingly restored in 1994 by a team of European scholars from the five surviving prints that had escaped destruction. Nosferatu is the first film to feature a Vampire's death by sunlight, which formerly only weakened vampires.\n\nThe next classic treatment of the vampire legend was in Universal's \"Dracula\" starring Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula. \nFive years after the release of the film, Universal released \"Dracula's Daughter\", a direct sequel that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, \"Son of Dracula\", starring Lon Chaney Jr. followed in 1943. Despite his apparent death in the 1931 film, the Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: 1944's \"House of Frankenstein\", 1945's \"House of Dracula\" and 1948's \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\". While Lugosi had played a vampire in two other movies during the 1930s and 1940s, it was only in this final film that he played Count Dracula onscreen for the second (and last) time.\nDracula was reincarnated for a new generation in the celebrated Hammer Horror series of films, starring Christopher Lee as the Count. The first of these films \"Dracula\" (1958) was followed by seven sequels. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of these.\nA distinct subgenre of vampire films, ultimately inspired by Le Fanu's \"Carmilla\" explored the topic of the lesbian vampire. The first of these was \"Blood and Roses\" (1960) by Roger Vadim. More explicit lesbian content was provided in Hammer Studios Karnstein trilogy. The first of these, \"The Vampire Lovers\", (1970), starring Ingrid Pitt and Madeleine Smith, was a relatively straightforward re-telling of LeFanu's novella, but with more overt violence and sexuality.\nLater films in this subgenre such as \"Vampyres\" (1974) became even more explicit in their depiction of sex, nudity and violence.\n\nBeginning with the absurd \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948) the vampire film has often been the subject of comedy. \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" (1967) by Academy Award winner Roman Polanski was a notable parody of the genre. Other comedic treatments, of variable quality, include \"Old Dracula\" (1974) featuring David Niven as a lovelorn Dracula, \"Love at First Bite\" (1979 United States) featuring George Hamilton and \"\" (1995 United States, directed by Mel Brooks) with Canadian Leslie Nielsen giving it a comic twist.\n\nAnother development in some vampire films has been a change from supernatural horror to science fictional explanations of vampirism. \"The Last Man on Earth\" (Italy 1964, directed by Ubaldo Ragona) and \"The Omega Man\" (1971 USA, directed by Boris Sagal), both based on Richard Matheson's novel \"I Am Legend\", are two examples. Vampirism is explained as a kind of virus in David Cronenberg's \"Rabid\" (1976 Canada), \"Red-Blooded American Girl\" (1990 Canada, directed by David Blyth) and Michael and Peter Spierig's \"Daybreakers\" (2009 United States).\n\nRace has been another theme, as exemplified by the blaxploitation picture \"Blacula\" (1972) and several sequels.\n\nSince the time of Bela Lugosi's \"Dracula\" (1931) the vampire, male or female, has usually been portrayed as an alluring sex symbol. There is, however, a very small subgenre, pioneered in Murnau's seminal \"Nosferatu\" (1922) in which the vampire is depicted in the hideous lineaments of the creature of European folklore. Max Schrek's disturbing portrayal of this role in Murnau's film was copied by Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's remake \"\" (1979). In \"Shadow of the Vampire\" (2000, directed by E. Elias Merhige), Willem Dafoe plays Max Schrek, himself, though portrayed here as an actual vampire. Dafoe's character is the ugly, disgusting creature of the original \"Nosferatu\". The main tradition has, however, been to portray the vampire in terms of a predatory sexuality. Christopher Lee, Delphine Seyrig, Frank Langella, and Lauren Hutton are just a few examples of actors who brought great sex-appeal into their portrayal of the vampire.\n\nA major character in most vampire films is the vampire slayer, of which Stoker's Abraham Van Helsing is a prototype. However, killing vampires has changed. Where Van Helsing relied on a stake through the heart, in \"Vampires\" 1998 USA, directed by John Carpenter, Jack Crow (James Woods) has a heavily armed squad of vampire hunters, and in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992 USA, directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui), writer Joss Whedon (who created TV's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and spinoff \"Angel\") attached The Slayer, Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson in the film, Sarah Michelle Gellar in the TV series), to a network of Watchers and mystically endowed her with superhuman powers.\n\nThe 1973 Serbian horror film \"Leptirica\" (\"The She-Butterfly\") was inspired by the story of Sava Savanović.\n\nOther notable Vampire movies also include the following, but not limited to:\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo game series featuring vampires primarily use Dracula or Dracula-inspired characters. Konami's \"Castlevania\" series is the longest running series which uses the Dracula legend, though its writers have made their own alterations to the legend. An exception to this trend is the \"Legacy of Kain\" video game series, which features vampires set in an entirely fictional world called Nosgoth. Video game series such as Konami's \"Castlevania\" and role-playing games such as \"\" have been especially successful and influential.\nOther vampires seen in games include:\n\n\n\n\n\n'The Vampire' (1897) by Philip Burne-Jones depicts an alluring female vampire crouched over a male victim. The model was the famous actress Mrs Patrick Campbell. This femme fatale inspired a poem of the same name (also 1897) by Rudyard Kipling. Like much of Kipling's verse it was incredibly popular, and its inspired many early silent films whose 'vampires' were actually 'vamps' rather than being supernatural undead blood-suckers. The poem's refrain: \"A fool there was . . . \", describing a seduced man, became the title of the popular film \"A Fool There Was\" (1915) which made Theda Bara a star, and the archetypal cinematic 'vamp'.\n\n\n\nMany regional vampire myths, or other creatures similar to or related to vampires have appeared in popular culture.\n\n\n\nBoth \"Penanggalan\" and \"Mystics in Bali\" feature actor W.D. Mochtar as the priest who fights the Penanggalan. Both \"The Witch With Flying Head\" and \"Mystics in Bali\" depict an innocent transformed into a Penanggalan against her will. In the former film, there is an effort to save her, and her attempt at suicide upon learning her condition is thwarted. In the latter film, she is considered irredeemable, and her neck is spiked to destroy her. Both characters are monstrous only at night and unaware of their nocturnal behavior until informed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Stirge\" was presented as a popular monster in Dungeons and Dragons. In the game it took the form of a many-legged flying creature which sucked the blood from its victims through a sharp, tubular beak.\n\nA version of the striga makes an appearance in \"The Witcher (video game)\" based on the works of Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. As a demonic undead creature, which transforms from the corpse of a dead child conceived via incest, striga in the Witcher's universe doesn't look like insects or vampires but looks similar to a ghoul with a muscular quadrupedal body, big claws, and a fang-filled mouth.\n\nThe strix make an appearance in the \"\" historical book \"Requiem for Rome\". In contrast to the more traditional vampires presented in the line, the strix are disembodied spirits who commonly take the shape of owls and can possess both humans and torpored vampires. It is rumored that the strix restored Remus to undeath, and corrupted a sixth clan of vampires who were destroyed en masse. The strix believed themselves to be betrayed by the vampires of Rome, especially those of the Julii clan, and swore to bring about their ruin. They reappear in \"Night Horrors: Wicked Dead\" as heralds of disaster, mainly unbound by their former oath (although they still occasionally pursue such activities for personal reasons). Immensely amoral libertines, they view vampires clinging to humanity as weak, and as such will often serve as tempters in order to make them lose themselves to the Beast.\n\nStrix are also described in the GURPS third edition Sourcebook for Vampires \"Blood Types\". They are described as witches who, having made pacts with dark entities gained the ability to become blood drinking birds at night. What their pacts with these dark forces require of them is not described.\n\n\n\n\n"}
