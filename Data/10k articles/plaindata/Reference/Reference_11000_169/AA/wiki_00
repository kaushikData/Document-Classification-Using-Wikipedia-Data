{"id": "3717654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3717654", "title": "Alan Clark Diaries", "text": "Alan Clark Diaries\n\nAlan Clark kept a regular diary from 1955 until August 1999 (during his second spell as a Member of Parliament) when he was incapacitated due to the onset of the brain tumour which was to be the cause of his death a month later. The last month of his life would be chronicled by his wife, Jane.\n\n\nAlan Clark published his diaries covering the period 1983 to 1992 after he left the House of Commons, deciding not to seek re-election to his Plymouth Sutton seat. Published in 1993 and known simply as \"Diaries\" (although later subtitled \"In Power\"), they have been recognised as a definitive account of the downfall of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\n\nBefore his death in 1999, Clark had started work on the prequel to the 1983–1992 \"Diaries\" to cover his entry in politics, from seeking a Conservative Association to adopt him as their Parliamentary Candidate in 1972 until the 1983 general election. Published a year after his death, this volume was titled \"Diaries: Into Politics\" and covered 1972 to 1983.\n\nThe final volume, covering Clark's decision not to seek re-election at the 1992 general election, his regret at leaving the House of Commons and then his return to Parliament was published in 2002 and included Clark's final days dying from a brain tumour.\n\nThroughout his diaries Clark refers admiringly to Henry \"Chips\" Channon and his diaries. He also quotes Adolf Hitler, to whom he refers as \"Wolf\".\n\nThe diaries include much reference to Clark's love of his chalet at Zermatt, his Scottish estate at Eriboll and the architecture of and country around Saltwood Castle, his home in Kent. Clark's fascination with classic cars is also evident, as his enthusiasm for backgammon.\n\nThe Diaries were serialised into six episodes of \"The Alan Clark Diaries\" by the BBC and shown in 2004 with John Hurt and Jenny Agutter.\n\nThe first published diaries open with Alan Clark, Conservative Member of Parliament for Plymouth Sutton since February 1974, about to seek re-election at the 1983 general election. The Conservatives were expected to win the election, following the recent Falklands War and a disunited Labour Party, and Clark expected to be promoted from the back benches.\n\nEarly on in the diaries, Clark records the death of his father, the author, broadcaster and art historian Kenneth Clark, from whom Clark inherited Saltwood Castle in Hythe, Kent.\n\nIn the very next entry in the diary, we get an insight into one of Clark's recurring lapses with the opposite sex. His opponent at the election, the Labour candidate, was 22-year-old Frances Holland, of whom Clark records;\n\nClark is, at this time, also carrying on an adulterous affair with Valerie Harkess, the wife of a South African judge, and her two daughters (to whom he referred collectively as \"the coven\"). Clark made no effort to disguise the coven's identity. The affair became public knowledge in 1992 after Clark left the House of Commons, and it was cited in the Harkess divorce case.\n"}
{"id": "37755134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37755134", "title": "Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library", "text": "Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library\n\nThe Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia is a research library that specializes in American history and literature, history of Virginia and the southeastern United States, the history of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, and the history and arts of the book. The library is named after Albert and Shirley Small, who donated substantially to the construction of the library's current building. Albert Small, an alumnus of the University of Virginia, also donated his large personal collection of \"autograph documents and rare, early printings of the Declaration of Independence.\" This collection includes a rare printing of the Dunlap broadside of the Declaration of Independence. Joining the library's existing Dunlap in the Tracy W. McGregor Collection of American History, Small's copy made U.Va. the only American institution with two examples of this, the earliest printing of the nation's founding document. It also includes the only letter written on July 4, 1776, by a signer of the Declaration, Caesar Rodney. The Albert H. Small Declaration of Independence Collection boasts an interactive digital display which allows visitors to view the historical documents electronically, providing access to children and an opportunity for visitors to manipulate the electronic copies without risk of damage to the original work.\n\nThough the collections cover a range of fields, the library is best known for the Tracy W. McGregor Library of American History, the Clifton Waller Barrett Library of American Literature, the William Faulkner collections, Jorge Luis Borges Collections, the Sadleir-Black Collection of Gothic Fiction, extensive book, manuscript, and photography holdings in Virginia history, and original documents of the works, life, and legacy of Thomas Jefferson. Additional strengths include historical papers of James Madison, Dolly Madison and James Monroe, typography and other book arts, trade catalogues, slave narratives, equestrianism and other forms of traditional sports, documents, correspondence and oral records of the Southern Civil Rights Movement, political and public affairs papers of major Virginia political figures, and one of the world's largest collections of miniature books.\n\nThomas Jefferson situated a library, rather than a chapel, at the center of the University of Virginia's campus, unlike existing American colleges. He also composed the first list of books to be included in the collection and placed newspaper appeals for library gifts to fill the new library, which was housed in The Rotunda. James Madison, who was the second rector of the university after Jefferson, established the first endowment fund for acquisitions, through a bequest made in his will in 1836. After the Rotunda burned in 1895, only twenty percent of the original books survived; they are the longest held volumes in the Small Special Collections Library today, and librarians have for many years been acquiring replacements for burnt volumes. The University Archives and the earliest manuscript gift to the university—the papers of Richard Henry Lee, acquired before 1832—also survived.\n\nIn the early decades of the twentieth century, many rare and unique items were added to the library's collections, both books and manuscripts. Purchases were also made as well, including the John Henry Ingram collection of Edgar Allan Poe. In 1930 a \"Virginia Collection\" was established in one wing of the library and the first archivist was hired. Following the construction of the new Alderman Library in 1938, the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts was organized to house and administer the principal historical materials in the library's collection. Over time, these units became separated, so that by 1962 there were two divisions: the Rare Books Division and the Manuscripts and University Archives Division. These departments merged in 1987 to form the Special Collections Department. In 2004, the current building opened.\n\nIn 1938, the library accepted as a donation the library of Tracy W. McGregor, the Detroit philanthropist and book collector; McGregor had bequeathed his collection to the administrators of the McGregor Fund, who selected the University of Virginia as its final home. The fund also supported the construction of the McGregor Library, a large room in the new Alderman Library that housed the Rare Books reading room for several decades. McGregor's collection of rare books, maps, and manuscripts comprised three areas of study: American exploration and history, British literature, and Cotton Mather and other members of the Mather family. The collection immediately established the University of Virginia as a center for the study of American history and culture. \n\nIn 1960, the library received a deposit that established it as a major site for the study of American Literature, when Clifton Waller Barrett placed in the library his major collection of books and manuscripts of major and minor American writers through 1940. The library has continued to collect in the tradition of Barrett since the collection arrived; Barrett's donation was finalized in the early 1990s. The Barrett book collection contains first and other significant editions of virtually every major work of American literature from the nation's founding to 1950, as well as many minor works, since Barrett's collecting interests stretched well beyond the canon. Of particular interest are deep holdings in little known writers, and an extensive collectionof editions and other printed materials related to Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Some of the significant manuscript materials held within the Barrett Collection include more than a hundred letters of the early American novelist Charles Brockden Brown, manuscripts of several major works of Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper, hundreds of manuscript fragments for the significantly enlarged second edition of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, a large collection of the papers of Louisa May Alcott and the Alcott family, significant manuscripts and correspondence of Mark Twain, the papers of Stephen Crane, including a manuscript of The Red Badge of Courage, over 650 letters of Henry James, significant holdings in the manuscripts, personal papers, and correspondence of Lafcadio Hearn, Robert Frost (including a recently discovered unpublished poem), and Ernest Hemingway, and the papers of novelists John Dos Passos and Ellen Glasgow and poets Vachel Lindsay and Sara Teasdale.\n\nThe university has long been the home to many original documents relating to Thomas Jefferson and his family. Holdings include hundreds of letters to and from Jefferson, his architectural drawings, family documents, numerous books from Jefferson's library, an extensive research collection of works about Jefferson, and artifacts such as one of his polygraphs and the telescope with which Jefferson watched the construction of the university from his hilltop home nearby, Monticello.\n\nThe library documents the history of the university all the way back to its founding; holdings include the original minute book of the Board of Visitors, written mostly in the hand of the first secretary, Thomas Jefferson, as well as the first matriculation book, which documents every student who entered the university in its early decades, including notables such as Edgar Allan Poe. Early ledgers of the university document the building of the university's structures, the renting of enslaved laborers to build and maintain the campus, and the development of a curriculum. Documents from the late nineteenth- through the twentieth century document the development of the university's modern infrastructure, student organizations, expansion of the campus and operations, and debates over the university's refusal to admit women and black students.\n\nPapers of many of the university's most prominent faculty are held in Special Collections, including civil rights activist Julian Bond, physicist Jesse Beams, poet Charles Wright, and novelists Ann Beattie and John Casey.\n\nU.Va. holds the largest collection of printed and manuscript materials related to William Faulkner. His association with the library began when he came to the university as a visiting faculty member, first in the 1930s and then in the late 1950s. The William Faulkner Foundation, which Faulkner founded, was created in part as a mechanism by which to secure the continued deposit of his papers in the university's Manuscripts Collection after his death, which occurred in 1962. This collection, converted from a deposit to a gift in 1962, comprises the bulk of the manuscripts and typescripts of the writer's novels and short stories, along with extensive correspondence and other related materials. In 1960, scholar and bibliographer Linton Massey had donated his massive collection of Faulkner editions, periodicals, and secondary works. Faulkner's daughter, Jill, deposited many further manuscripts and over 300 books from Faulkner's library over the course of many years, and additional Faulkner collections, such as the papers of U.Va. professor and Faulkner biographer Joseph Blotner, have been added. The collection is the basis for a major online archive of Faulkner audio recordings.\nThe collections are an important source for research on the history of Virginia, with particular strength in Charlottesville and Central Virginia. Collections of many significant Virginia families, plantations, and businesses are at the core of historical materials documenting Virginia from its earliest days to the present. Plantation and early family papers contain rare information about enslaved persons, including a significant collection of letters written by previously enslaved Virginians who moved to Liberia. The collections are notable in their representation of regional debates over race, including the archives of influential eugenicists and civil rights activists. Also notable are the records of the Charlottesville School Board, which document the era of desegregation and massive resistance. Papers of Charlottesville and Albemarle County political figures are wide ranging.\n\nThe collections are rich in the genre of political or editorial cartoons, and include the archives of Richmond editorial cartoonist Ed Seibel, UVA alumnus Bob Gorrell, and Art Wood. The Gerald Meeks Collection is a comprehensive collection of examples of American cartoon artists; among its treasures are a large collection of Oscar Cesare originals. The papers of Edward Stettinius Jr. include a large number of original editorial cartoons about the founding of the United Nations. A complete set of Vanity Fair (UK magazine) caricatures also resides in the library. In 2018 the library acquired the papers and original art of editorial cartoonist and fine artist Pat Oliphant. \n\nThe Gordon Collection (also known as the Douglas H. Gordon Collection) comprises some 1200 volumes of French books dating from the sixteenth through the 19th century. Over 600 were printed before 1600, and many retain their original bindings.\n\nSpecial Collections is visited by a wide range of audiences, and its collections likewise have been featured in significant publications worldwide. Major cross-institutional digital humanities projects featuring the collections include the \"Walt Whitman Archive\", the Edgar Allan Poe Society's collected e-texts website, the \"Rossetti Archive\", \"Mark Twain in his Times\", and \"Uncle Tom's Cabin & American Culture\". Among several large digital collections produced in-house are the Jackson Davis Collection, a significant resource for the study of African American educational history and the photo archive of the studio of Rufus Holsinger, who documented life in Charlottesville, Virginia; this was the first University of Virginia collection to join the Digital Public Library of America project and one of the DPLA's founding collections.\n\nThe library's collections play a prominent role in many courses taught in the Rare Book School, which serves hundreds of scholars, librarians, and book dealers each summer. Of particular interest are the extensive publishers bindings, early printed works, and a working Hinman Collator.\n\nIn 2012, the Special Collections played a significant role in documenting the ouster and reinstatement of the university's president, Teresa Sullivan. Along with collecting physical documentation of the public and press reaction to the events, the library made news for collecting born digital materials and accepting materials collected for the library by members of the public.\n\n"}

{"id": "2738214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2738214", "title": "Arlo and Janis", "text": "Arlo and Janis\n\nArlo and Janis is an American gag-a-day comic strip written and drawn by Jimmy Johnson. It is a leisurely paced domestic situation comedy. It was first published in newspapers on July 29, 1985.\n\nThe focus of the strip is tightly on its two title characters, a middle-aged, middle-class baby boomer couple with an easygoing approach to life. The family surname is Day, but it's only rarely used in the strip. Johnson confessed, \"When I first sold the strip, the family had no name. The strip itself had no name! Preparing to launch, the syndicate brain trust decided, 'Let's make their name \"Day\" and call the strip \"Day by Day.\" ' However, it turned out there was an old, semi-defunct newspaper column called \"Day by Day,\" and legally timid heads prevailed. The strip was named \"Arlo and Janis.\" I subsequently kept the name ‘Day.’ Why not?\" Johnson, surveying his core cast, compared Gene, Janis and Arlo to Larry, Moe and Curly, respectively, with the family cat, Ludwig, corresponding to Shemp.\n\n\n\n\"Arlo and Janis\" strips are most often gag-a-day strips based on recurring themes, with only rarely any advancement of continuity. Readers may see themselves in Johnson's observations, and have written to his blog jokingly accusing Johnson of looking in their windows.\n\nOccasionally, Johnson strings together a few daily gags that, taken together, amount to the exploration of a topic. Only rarely does he create arcs of daily strips that together take on all the traditional elements of a story.\n\nJohnson wrote, \"I’ve always enjoyed serial strips, but they change the nature of the product. Ultimately, I think I prefer the gag-a-day format, done well. The 'done well' part is crucial. Of course, they can’t be hilarious every day.\"\n\n\"Sometimes when I get on a roll with an extended conversation within a sequence of strips\", Johnson observed, \"the whole can be viewed like a short comic book.\"\n\nJohnson wrote that early on he experimented with short poems \"when I wanted to do something a bit different or when I was stuck for a better idea.\" In time it occurred to him that the limerick format was inherently comical and \"fit the four-panel format\" of the comic strip. Since the time of that realization, the limerick has been an occasionally recurring structure in the daily strip.\n\nSome of his recurring themes for jokes and storylines are touched on below:\n\nMany of the most notable jokes are based on sexual attraction, especially Arlo's desire for Janis. Despite having been a couple since meeting in college in 1973 (a backstory revealed in a series of strips that also functioned as a parody of the book and film \"Gone with the Wind\"), Arlo and Janis are still besotted with each other. The libidinous content of the strip can be surprisingly overt to readers accustomed to more sanitized newspaper comics. And in a medium where long marriages are often presented as either sexless or antagonistic (\"The Lockhorns\", \"Andy Capp\", etc.), these strips that show the couple's love and ongoing attraction to each other offer an alternative.\n\n\"There has always been knowledge of sex in \"Arlo and Janis\", and the fact that married people have sex,\" Johnson said. \"I think it's silly to ignore that humans have sex. It's like ignoring eating and sleeping.\" Johnson also wrote, \"I'd be willing to bet you five dollars I was the first cartoonist to depict a couple exchanging sexual fantasies in bed.\"\n\nOn the \"Comics I Don't Understand\" website, \"The Arlo Award\" is given to a cartoonist who slips something past the syndicate censors.\n\nJanis's negative body image has been a popular topic over the years. She sees herself as at least a little overweight, and unworthy of wearing a two-piece swimsuit. Arlo, on the other hand, persistently tries to convince her to put on the bikini again.\n\nThe early years of the strip regularly featured office humor. Johnson claims he was \"doing office humor when Scott Adams worked for the phone company\", but he used the theme less frequently over time. Johnson has attributed that decline to two factors. First, his memories of own his experiences in an office setting began to fade as he became ensconced in his cartooning, leaving him \"neither inclined nor qualified to comment on 'the office.'\" Second, he feels that with the concept of traditional \"careers\" falling by the wayside, his middle-aged title characters would tend to center their lives around relationships and home. Seldom were jobs even mentioned as time passed, and by 2017, Johnson felt he needed to address the suspicion of readers that Arlo and Janis were retired. While proclaiming they retained their usual undefined jobs, Johnson allowed that Arlo and Janis were in \"that winding-down phase of employment.\"\n\nStereotypical gender differences between Arlo and Janis provide a lot of the strip's content. For example, Janis often accuses Arlo of not listening to her, and he pretends that he does. Arlo watches football and Janis complains about it.\n\nArlo's envy of the cat Ludwig's idyllic lifestyle, sometimes veiled as criticism, fuels many strips. \"I make it a rule to draw one cat cartoon a week,\" Johnson writes. \"I draw a cat cartoon every fifth or sixth Sunday. Other than that, I don't plan it. Sometimes, a cat cartoon will run late in the week, then on Sunday, then again early the next week. Inevitably, I will get mail of the ilk, 'I hate your stupid cat cartoons! That's all you do anymore! Why don't you throw yourself under a bus, you loser!' If I were a cat, I'd steer clear of those types.\" Johnson's readers submit many stories of cute cats to his blog.\n\nJohnson also treats Arlo's envy of Gene's youth and freedom, and Arlo's ironic and sympathetic observation of Gene's unawareness of how much lies ahead. Janis is shown worrying that Gene is growing up—and away—before she is ready and she struggles to hold onto him.\n\nThe strip often includes political viewpoints. In particular, Arlo regularly rants about the damaging influence of large corporations on American society. One lengthy storyline examined American and Cuban relations. Another related the World War II experience of Arlo's father.\n\n\"Arlo and Janis\" humorously criticizes the pace, direction, and quality of modern American life. Arlo feels trapped on a \"treadmill\" and has questioned the wisdom of the entire disposable consumer economy on multiple occasions. In the strip on Sunday, November 30, 2008, this idea was reiterated by Janis: \"You said we buy things we don't need with money we don't have.\" Arlo counters with, \"But the people who sell us the things we don't need depend on the money we don't have.\" In August 2009, Arlo has gone up a tree to escape \"the absurdity of modern living,\" but he soon pines for a Kindle.\n\nSo-called conveniences like cable television and cellular phones are examined. For example, the miniaturization of data storage devices is both trumpeted and lampooned in the November 3, 2007, daily, with Janis unable to find the tiny disk that conveniently holds all her photographs. The loss of privacy that has come with the internet is also mourned: \"I still think it's creepy to go to a book or music web site and have it make suggestions of 'other titles you might enjoy,'\" admits Johnson.\n\nThere are regular detours from \"reality\". In one case, Arlo \"called in sick\" to the strip and was replaced by a large, realistically drawn alligator for a week. Janis imagined a large dust-bunny named Harvey in another sequence, representing her feelings of house-keeping inadequacy. Janis has shared her fantasy of being a torch singer and Arlo has periodically \"sailed away\" from his mundane existence in extended daydreams. The courtship of a mermaid by a fisherman and a fable of the grasshopper and the ant were both played out by the Arlo and Janis characters. The fourth wall is sometimes broken, and readers sometimes are shown behind the scenes, with the \"actors\" preparing for the strip. For example, as Daylight Saving Time ended on November 4, 2012, nothing is happening, and Arlo implies that the reader has come in too early due to the time change, and that the \"comic strip doesn't begin for another hour.\"\n\nThere have been many meta-joke strips about the process of creating a daily comic strip, particularly about writer's block, with the character admitting (for the cartoonist) the absence of a joke or the reuse of a joke used before. Arlo's fondness for and the inclusion in the strip of the Mississippi-born singer/songwriter Jimmy Buffett reveal Johnson's musical taste, and his love of sailing mirrors Johnson's. Within the Sunday strip for January 1, 2012, Arlo affixes that same strip onto his freezer door, creating the infinity effect sometimes used on comic book covers, and also referencing that habit of comic strip readers to clip and post favorites.\n\nIn the July 19, 2018 daily strip, Johnson steps out into full view. He draws himself drinking coffee at the drawing board. A blank sheet of paper awaits an inspiration.\n\nThough it's unclear exactly where Arlo and Janis live, Johnson's southern upbringing regularly influences the strip, and it might be assumed that they live in or near a southern city such as Jackson, Mississippi, Birmingham, Alabama or Atlanta, Georgia. On the other hand, it snows quite a bit in their area. In a 2008 strip, Johnson put their home a four-hour drive from the coast, but he didn't reveal which coast.\n\nJohnson wrote in his blog on January 2, 2014, \"I remember not long after I started drawing Arlo & Janis , I made a reference to eating peas on New Year’s Day, and my editor in New York City expressed concern that might be a 'southern' tradition, and we didn’t want to give newspaper editors the idea A&J was a 'southern' strip. I guess she was afraid I’d start doing jokes about fatback and kissin’ cousins.\"\n\nMost of the action takes place in the home and the yard, both of which are portrayed with an economy of ink. In earlier years especially, a glimpse into the office environments of either Arlo or Janis might be given. There are occasional forays into the neighborhood, but there are few if any discernible landmarks there. The seashore is the favored vacation destination.\n\nEspecially after Gene's marriage, the strip's setting expanded to include Gene's family's home, their farm, and their farm stand and cafe.\n\nAccording to Johnson's ex-wife, the newspaper columnist Rheta Grimsley Johnson, the lead characters are named after 1960s music icons Arlo Guthrie and Janis Joplin, and their son after Eugene McCarthy. Jimmy Johnson has said that Arlo was inspired by a friend with curly hair who resembles Guthrie, and the name Janis was \"a marketing device used to attract the baby boom generation.\" Some readers have suggested that the strip is autobiographical, because Janis and Rheta Grimsley Johnson are lookalikes, as are Johnson and Arlo. Rheta Grimsley Johnson confirms the physical resemblances, but states that the strip is not autobiographical, noting that they did not have any children, and that there is not a contrast between her personality and that of Johnson, unlike the personality differences in the strip between Arlo and Janis.\n\nJimmy Johnson lives in the coastal city of Pass Christian, Mississippi. Although his own house was largely undamaged by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, the devastation of his adopted hometown affected Johnson greatly; his blog at ArloAndJanis.com focused on little else for months afterward, and references to the hurricane appeared in the strip in the last third of 2005.\n\nThere has been one paperback reprint volume titled \"Arlo and Janis: Bop 'Till You Drop\". It was published by Pharos Books in February 1989. The ISBN numbers assigned to it are: ; and . When offered for sale on Amazon.com, it is usually priced as a prized collectable.\n\nJohnson made mention in his blog of wanting to publish a twentieth anniversary volume for 2005. In 2008, after repeated inquiries by posters to his blog, the idea was revived on April 1, but on March 3, 2011, Johnson announced in his blog that the book deal had fallen through. Finally in November 2011, Johnson self-published \"Beaucoup Arlo & Janis\", a 256-page, hard-bound collection of over 900 carefully selected A&J comic strips with several introductory essays by the creator.\n\n"}

It is notable because the Tseshaht First Nation recognize it as the creation site where the first man and first woman of the Tseshaht people came into this world.\n\nBenson is a small, irregularly shaped island on the northwestern edge of the Broken Group. It covers about and is about at its longest points from north to south. The shoreline is mostly very rugged, with two rock beaches on the northeast and southeast sides of the island. The northeast beach is the site of a former Tseshaht village, and there is a large cultural shell midden extending approximately along the shoreline. There is a small blowhole on the west side that is active mostly during high tides.\n\nThe oral history of the Tseshaht people, part of the Nuu-Chah-Nulth culture of western British Columbia, identifies Ts'ishaa (C'isaa) (Benson Island) as the place where Kapkimyis, a supernatural being in their tradition, created the first Tseshaht man and woman. There are several versions of the story about this event. The following is taken from two current versions as told by the Tseshaht people:\n\n\nThe significance of C'isaa (Ts'ishaa) to the Tseshaht people is indicated by their very name: \"Tseshaht\" means \"people of Ts'ishaa\".\n\nArcheological evidence shows the site at C'isaa was first occupied over 5,000 years ago, and Tseshaht oral history tells of continuing occupation of the site until after European contact. The Tseshaht people used Ts'ishaa as a home village as they followed sea mammals, salmon and other food and natural resources throughout Barkley Sound as the seasons changed.\n\nIn 1791 the Spanish Ship \"Santa Saturina\" entered Barkley Sound, marking the first European contact with the indigenous people living in the area. Over the next 100 years the Tseshaht and other First Nations in the area suffered enormous population declines, primarily from diseases such as smallpox that were brought by the European explorers.\n\nBy 1865 the island was labeled on British Admiralty charts as Hawkins Island. In 1893 John W. Benson purchased the island and proceeded to build a large home on the east side of the island. The home was later expanded into a hotel for visitors. On November 19, 1922 the Victoria \"Colonist\" newspaper reported that the island \"had a small hotel worth visiting. There were about ten acres cleared and a portion of it was planted in a garden and orchard to supply the hotel. The island and hotel are owned by Mrs. Benson, widow of an old-time sealing captain, and one of the early pioneers of the West Coast of Vancouver Island.\"\n\nIn 1970 most of the Broken Group islands, including Benson, were included in the newly designated Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. The island has been a popular destination for sea kayakers, recreational sailors and other visitors to the area.\n\nIn 2009 Parks Canada and the Tseshaht First Nation reached an agreement to prohibit all camping on the island due to its cultural significance. An interpretive display about the importance of the island was installed in 2012. It includes a tall wooden house standing post carved by Tseshaht artist Gordon Dick. Day trips are still permitted so that visitors may learn about the Tseshaht history.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140924042034/http://www.pacificrimpark.com/\n\nhttp://www.vancouverisland.com/plan-your-trip/regions-and-towns/vancouver-island-bc-islands/broken-group-islands/\n"}

In the Black Country in 1870 there were 160 pawnbrokers in the area, Walsall had 15 and Wednesbury had 48. For a housewife with a large family to look after it was a constant struggle to make ends meet. It was not uncommon for a family to have linen or clothes that they would pawn as a bridging loan until next payday. The struggling family could pawn their goods on a Monday and could buy them back the following Friday or Saturday. The items pawned were taken as security for a loan, the value of the item was based on what the pawnbroker thought he would get if he sold the item on. In return the customer would receive the loan a ticket. To redeem their pledge the customer had to pay the loan back in full plus any charges this included the valuation of their items and the cost of the ticket. \n\nPawnbrokers in the Black Country needed to be where the people were. Some of these businesses started in Public Houses, which were frequently visited and saved customers a trip into town. Other Pawnbrokers operated out of converted houses in prominent positions like corner shops.\n\nThe pair of cottages from School Lane in Himley originally operated as a corner shop. The setting of the display was designed to represent a small scale business. The shop takes its name from a well known Black Country pawnbroker, Joseph Wiltshire, who owned shops in Great Bridge, Wolverhampton and Carter's Green in West Bromwich. The exhibit at the Black Country Living Museum combines pawnbroking with retail, as did many pawnbroking businesses in the 19th century. In the museum's reconstruction the unredeemed goods and other stock are sold in the front room, while pawning of goods was done in the 'pledge room' at the back. \n\nThe shop window of the Pawnbroker's gives a good example of the types of goods that customers would 'pledge'. The display includes shoes, clothes, furs, musical instruments, children's toys and even a set of false teeth.\n"}

{"id": "221909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221909", "title": "COBRA (avant-garde movement)", "text": "COBRA (avant-garde movement)\n\nCOBRA (or CoBrA) was a European avant-garde movement active from 1948 to 1951. The name was coined in 1948 by Christian Dotremont from the initials of the members' home cities: Copenhagen (Co), Brussels (Br), Amsterdam (A).\n\nDuring the time of occupation of World War II, the Netherlands had been disconnected from the art world beyond its borders. COBRA was formed shortly thereafter. This international movement of artists who worked experimentally evolved from the criticisms of Western society and a common desire to break away from existing art movements, including \"detested\" naturalism and \"sterile\" abstraction. Experimentation was the symbol of an unfettered freedom, which, according to Constant, was ultimately embodied by children and the expressions of children. COBRA was formed by Karel Appel, Constant, Corneille, Christian Dotremont, Asger Jorn, and Joseph Noiret on 8 November 1948 in the Café Notre-Dame, Paris, with the signing of a manifesto, \"La cause était entendue\" (\"The Case Was Settled\"), drawn up by Dotremont. Formed with a unifying doctrine of complete freedom of colour and form, as well as antipathy towards Surrealism, the artists also shared an interest in Marxism as well as modernism.\nTheir working method was based on spontaneity and experiment, and they drew their inspiration in particular from children’s drawings, from primitive art forms and from the work of Paul Klee and Joan Miró.\n\nComing together as an amalgamation of the Dutch group Reflex, the Danish group Høst and the Belgian Revolutionary Surrealist Group, the group only lasted a few years but managed to achieve a number of objectives in that time: the periodical \"Cobra\", a series of collaborations between various members called \"Peintures-Mot\" and two large-scale exhibitions. The first of these was held at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, November 1949, the other at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Liège in 1951.\n\nIn November 1949 the group officially changed its name to Internationale des Artistes Expérimentaux with membership having spread across Europe and the United States, although this name has never stuck. The movement was officially disbanded in 1951, but many of its members remained close, with Dotremont in particular continuing collaborations with many of the leading members of the group. The primary focus of the group consisted of semi-abstract paintings with brilliant color, violent brushwork, and distorted human figures inspired by primitive and folk art and similar to American action painting. Cobra was a milestone in the development of Tachisme and European abstract expressionism.\n\nCobra was perhaps the last avant-garde movement of the twentieth century. According to Nathalie Aubert the group only\nlasted officially for three years (1948 to 1951). After that period each artist\nin the group developed their own individual paths.\n\nThe manifesto, entitled, \"La cause était entendue\" (The Case Was Settled) was written by CoBrA member Christian Dotremont and signed by all founding members in Paris in 1948. It was directly speaking to their experience attending the Centre International de Documentation sur l’Art d’Avant-garde in which they felt the atmosphere was sterile and authoritarian. It was a statement of working collaboratively in an organic mode of experimentation in order to develop their work separate from the current place of the avant-garde movement. The name of the manifesto was also a play on words from an earlier document signed by Belgian and French Revolutionary Surrealists in July 1947, entitled \"La cause est entendue\" (The Case Is Settled).\n\nThe European artists were different from their American counterparts (the Abstract expressionists) for they preferred the process over the product and introduced primitive, mythical, and folkloric elements along with a decorative input from their children. One of the new approaches that united the COBRA artists was their unrestrained use of strong colors, along with violent handwritings and figuration which can be either frightening or humorous. Their art was alive with subhuman figures in order to mirror the terror and weakness of our time unlike the dehumanized art of Abstraction. This spontaneous method was a rejection of Renaissance art, specialization, and ‘civilized art’, they preferred ‘uncivilized’ forms of expression which created an interplay between the conscious and the unconscious instead of the Surrealist interest in the unconscious alone. The childlike in their method meant a pleasure in painting, in the materials, forms, and finally the picture itself; this aesthetic notion was called ‘desire unbound’. The Dutch Artists in particular within Cobra (Corneille, Appel, Constant) were interested in Children's art.“We Wanted to start again like a child” Karel Appel insisted. As part of the Western Left, they were built upon the fusion of Art and Life through experiment in order to unite form and expression.\n\nThey exhibited mainly in Holland, but also Paris and other countries in Europe.\n\nThe first major exhibition was held at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam in November 1949 under the title \"International Experimental Art\".\n\nThe museum's director and curator Willem Sandberg was interested in bringing experimentalism and abstraction to The Netherlands, and had also been an active member of the Dutch Resistance during the war. He was deeply involved with the CoBrA group and maintained direct contacts between the artists and the Stedelijk Museum.\n\nThe architect Aldo van Eyck, who would later become known for his architecture of playgrounds as cultural critique, was asked to do the interior design of the exhibition. The close relationship between Van Eyck and the artists from the CoBrA, who also drew their inspiration in particular from children's drawings, makes it probable that much of Eyck's early inspiration for the playgrounds may have derived from CoBrA.\n\nThe Stedelijk Museum exhibition gave rise to furious criticism from press and the public. A critic from \"Het Vrije Volk\" (Free People) wrote, “Geklad, geklets en geklodder in het Stedelijk Museum” (“Smirch, twaddle and mess in the SMA\"). The CoBrA artists are considered scribblers and con artists. Newspapers spoke of offensive art and provocation on the part of the artists, and one evening for experimental poetry at the Stedelijk was the occasion for a public brawl.\n\nThe last CoBrA exhibit was located in Liège, Belgium, in 1951. Shortly after this exhibit, the group dissolved. The show was organised by Pierre Alechinsky, an artist from Belgium. The Dutch architect, Van Eyck designed the exhibition layout, just as he had for the 1949 CoBrA exhibition in Stedelijk. The innovations of this exhibit were that the composition for the wall was in a grid formation. In addition, the sculptures, which were featured in this show were on coal beds from the Liege area itself.\n\nThis show was not specific to only CoBrA artists, and also, major artists of the CoBrA movement were not in this exhibit due to the existing conflict within the group that eventually led to the collapse of CoBrA shortly after in the same year.\n\n\nNotable artists who had contact with, and/or were influenced by COBRA:\n\n\nThere is a Cobra Museum in Amstelveen, Netherlands, displaying works by Karel Appel and other international avant-garde artists.\n\nThe NSU Art Museum in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is known for its large assemblage of works of CoBrA art. The museum displays works by Karel Appel, Pierre Alechinsky, and Asger Jorn, the movement's leading exponents. (www.nsuartmuseum.org )<from Florida travel book and the museum's website>\n\nAuctioneers Bruun Rasmussen held an auction of COBRA artists on April 3, 2006 in Copenhagen. It set records for the highest price for an Asger Jorn painting (6.4 million DKK for \"Tristesse Blanche\") and for the highest amount raised in a single auction in Denmark (30 million DKK in total).\n\n\n"}

Azerbaijan was proclaimed independent in Tiflis on 28 May 1918.\n\nThe Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was founded by the Azerbaijani National Council in Tiflis on May 28, 1918 after the collapse of the Russian Empire that began with the Russian Revolution of 1917. The Muslim representation in the defunct Transcaucasian Seim had constituted itself into the Azerbaijani National Council, and on May 28, 1918 proclaimed that a new nation was born. So far only a geographical reference, Azerbaijan now became the name of a state, and some 2 million people, called variously Tatars, Transcaucasian Muslims and Caucasian Turks, officially became Azerbaijanis.\n\nAt the beginning of 1918, the political situation in the Caucasus remained critical. After the failure of the Russian-Germany peace talks in Brest-Litovsk, the German-Turkish troops began to attack on 6 December 1917 in the Caucasus. At the beginning of January 1918 Turkish troops were able to capture the Kars and Batumi provinces.\n\nDeputies from the Transcaucasus elected to the Russian Entrepreneurial Council decided to establish a Transcaucasian Sejm- the Transcaucasian Parliament as the government body in the country on February 14, 1918.\n\n30 members of Musavat Party and the Democratic Party of Neutral people, 7 members from the Muslim Socialists, 3 members from the İttihad Party, 4 members from the Democratic Socialist-Democratic Menshevik Party, included to Transcaucasian Sejm.(Parliament) As a result, 44 Azerbaijanis took place the Transcaucasian Seim and established the Muslim fraction of the Sejm. These were:\n\nFrom \"Musavat\" Party and a group of Democratic neutralities: Mammad Yusif Jafarov, AliMardan Topchubashov, Mammad Amin Rasulzadeh, Nasib Yusifbayli, Hasan bey Aghayev, Khosrov bay Sultanov, Mammadhasan Hajinski, Mir Hidayat bay Seyidov, Fatali Khan Khoyski, Khalil bey Khasmammadov, Ahmed Bey Mahammadbeyov, Aslan bey Gardashov, Shafi bay Rustambeyli, Javad Malik-Yeganov, Mustafa Mahmudov, Mehdi bey Hajibababeyov, Haji Selim Akhundzadeh, Mehdi bey Hacinski, Khudadat bey Malik-Aslanov, Museyib bey Eqikanova, Lutfali bey Behbudov, Firudin bey Kocharli, Ibrahim aga Vakilov, Hamid bey Shakhtakhtinski, Rahim bay Vakilov, Alasgar bey Mahmudbeyov, Yusif Efendizade, Mirza Jamal Yusifzade, Mammadrza aga Vakilov, Islam bey Gabulzadeh.\n\nOn 28 May 1918 in the palace of the former governor of the Russian emperor in the Caucasus in Tiflis, in the blue saloon for Muslim group of Transcaucasian Seim members of Azerbaijan National Council gathered at the meeting chaired by Dr. Hasan bey Aghayev. Dr. Hasan bey Aghayev informed the participants about the collapse of the Transcaucasian Sejm, as well as prevailing in the region internal and external situation. Aghayev put the consideration of the free and independent Azerbaijan. After a long and thorough discussion, the Secretary Mustafa Mahmudov read the names of voters; 24 votes, with 2 abstentions, adopted a Declaration of Independence of Azerbaijan. The Declaration was signed by Hasan bey Aghayev, Fatali Khan Khoyski, Nasib Yusifbeyli, Jamo bey Hajinski, Shafi bey Rustambeyli, Nariman bey Narimanbeyov, Javad Malik-Yeganov and Mustafa Mahmudov. Only Jafar Ahundov and one of the leaders of the party \"Ittihad\" Majid Sultan Ghani Zadeh didn't vote for the adoption of the Declaration.\n\nMonument of the Independence Declaration erected on the Istiglaliyyat Street in honor of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was opened on May 25, 2007. Independence Declaration (adopted in Tbilisi, 1918) in both version written with former Azerbaijani letters and the Latin alphabet were carved on the monument. President Ilham Aliyev attended in the opening ceremony. The monument was erected between the building of the Institute of Manuscripts of the Azerbaijan and the building of the Azerbaijan State University of Economic .\n\nOn the day of adoption of the Declaration of Independence - the Republic day of Azerbaijan is celebrated as a state holiday since May 28, 1990.\n"}

It involves all of the operations from production through drug distribution channels to the end consumer. \n\nPharmaceutical packaging is highly regulated but with some variation in the details, depending on the country of origin or the region. Several common factors can include: assurance of patient safety, assurance of the efficacy of the drug through the intended shelf life, uniformity of the drug through different production lots, thorough documentation of all materials and processes, control of possible migration of packaging components into the drug, control of degradation of the drug by oxygen, moisture, heat, etc., prevention of microbial contamination, sterility, etc. Packaging is often involved in dispensing, dosing, and use of the pharmaceutical product. Communication of proper use and cautionary labels are also regulated. Packaging is an integral part of pharmaceutical product. \nPharmaceutical packaging can often be thought of by the segment in the distribution system being encountered and by the functions needed by the user of the package. Packaging requirements are different.\n\nBulk pharmaceuticals can be shipped to another pharmaceutical company for further processing, to a contract packager for forming unit packs, to international customers, etc. Bulk shipments might be in fiber drums (with plastic liners), bulk boxes, corrugated boxes with liners, intermediate bulk containers, and other shipping containers.\n\nSmaller bulk packs can be shipped to pharmacies, particularly compounding pharmacies. The liquids or powders can be measured and put into primary packages.\n\nShipments to medical professionals could be at hospitals, nursing homes, veterinarians, dentists, etc. These packaged pharmaceuticals are intended to be dispensed and administered by professionally trained and certified personnel. \n\nDrugs under prescription control are sent to pharmacies in multi-packs of unit packs or in bottles containing many hundreds of capsules. Typically a pharmacist prepares the final form of the unit pack or places a lower count of capsules in a small bottle for the customer. In a pharmacy, pharmacists are available to answer questions and to ensure that proper documentation is provided. Internet pharmacies mail the prescribed drugs to the customer; boxes or mailing envelopes are used. Child resistant packaging is often required on the unit packs; if requested, a pharmacist is allowed put drugs in a bottle with easy open features.\n\nOver-the-counter drugs are sold in drug stores, grocery stores, and diverse retail outlets. Usually the package needs to have all the usage information available. Packages often need to have tamper resistant features and child-resistant packaging.\n\nUsually the packaging and labeling of dietary supplements, homeopathic drugs, and folk medicines are not regulated. Some producers voluntarily follow the regulations for over-the-counter drugs or regional Pharmacopoeias.\n\nThe wide variety of pharmaceutical solids, liquids, and gasses are packaged in a wide variety of packages. Some of the common primary packages are:\n\nFormed solid unit doses of pharmaceuticals (capsules, suppositories, tablets, etc.) are commonly packed in blister packs. In Europe about 85% of solid unit doses are packed in blister packs with only about 20% in North America. \n\nBlister packs are pre-formed plastic/paper/foil packaging used for formed solid drugs. The primary component of a blister pack is a cavity or pocket made from a thermoformed plastic. This usually has a backing of paperboard or a lidding seal of aluminum foil or plastic film. Blister packs are useful for protecting drugs against external factors, such as humidity and contamination for extended periods of time.\n\nBlister packing machinery is readily available and is suited to validation processes.\n\nBottles are commonly used for liquid pharmaceuticals as well as formed tablets and capsules. Glass is most common for liquids because it is inert and has excellent barrier properties. Various types of plastic bottles are used both by drug producers as well as by pharmacists in a pharmacy.\n\nPrescription bottles have been around since the 19th century. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, prescription medication bottles were called \"medicinal bottles\". There are many styles and shapes of prescription bottles.\n\nPrescription bottles come in several different colors, the most common of which being orange or light brown due to its ability to prevent ultraviolet light from degrading the potentially photosensitive contents through photochemical reactions, while still letting enough visible light through for the contents to be easily visible. Other common colors include: Clear (for compounds that don't degrade in light), blue, dark brown, green, and various opaque hues.\n\nSome mail order pharmacies are now offering timed dosing packets for medications. They put a certain number of pills, as directed by your physician into a plastic package and print the date and time that the drugs are to be taken. It is used for people with multiple medications that are taken at different times of the day. \n\nMany pharmaceutical products are sensitive to heat or cold. Controlled distribution systems and sometimes cold chains are required. \n\nA mail order or online pharmacy usually ships orders by mail services or by small parcel carrier. The shipment is not temperature-controlled and it may sit in a mail box upon delivery. Conditions can include high or low temperatures outside of the recommended storage conditions for certain products. For example, the USFDA found that the temperature in a steel mailbox painted black could reach 136 °F (58 °C) in full sun while the ambient air temperature was 101 °F (38 °C). Insulated mailing envelopes are sometimes used.\n\nLarger shipments are sent in insulated shipping containers with dry ice or gel packs. A digital Temperature data logger or a time temperature indicator is often enclosed to monitor the temperature inside the container for its entire shipment.\n\nCounterfeit drugs are a serious problem; people can be taking useless drugs or even very dangerous drugs without knowing it. Custom package seals, authentication labels, holograms, and security printing, can be valued parts of an entire security system. They help verify that enclosed drugs are what the package says they are. Drug counterfeiters, however, often work with package counterfeiters, some of whom can be sophisticated. No packaging system is completely secure.\n\nMedication packaging includes a document that provides information about that drug and its use. For prescription medications, the insert is technical, and provides information for medical professionals about how to prescribe the drug. Package inserts for prescription drugs often include a separate document called a \"patient package insert\" with information written in plain language intended for the end-user -- the person who will take the drug or give the drug to another person, for example a minor. Inserts for over-the-counter medication]s are also written plainly. \n\nIn the US the document is called \"prescribing information\" or the \"package insert\" (PI) and layperson's document is called the \"patient package insert\" (PPI). In Europe the technical document is called the \"summary of product characteristics\" and the document for end-users is called the \"package leaflet\".\n\nThe bottle or box also has information printed on it, intended for the person taking the medication.\n\nAll aspects of pharmaceutical production, including packaging, are tightly controlled and have regulatory requirements. Uniformity, cleanliness, sterility, and other requirements are needed to maintain Good Manufacturing Practices. \n\nProduct safety management is vital. A complete Quality Management System must be in place. Validation involves collecting documentary evidence of all aspects of compliance. Hazard analysis and critical control points is a methodology which has been proven useful. Quality assurance extends beyond the packaging operations through distribution and cold chain management; Good distribution practice is often a regulatory requirement.\n\nWith a large portion of pharmaceutical packaging being outsourced to contract packagers, additional demand is being placed on specialty areas, i.e. specialty dosage forms.\n\n\n\n"}

It was started by expelled former African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) President Julius Malema, and his allies, in 2013. Malema is President of the EFF, heading the Central Command Team which serves as the central structure of the party.\n\nIt is currently the third-largest party in both houses of the South African Parliament, receiving 1,169,259 votes and a 6.35% share of the vote in the 2014 general election. \n\nAt a 26 July 2013 press briefing in Soweto, Malema announced that the new party had over 1000 members, double the 500 required for registration with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). The EFF is now registered with the IEC, after an objection to its registration by the Freedom Front Plus (FF+) was dismissed in September 2013.\n\nIn 2015, the EFF suspended MP Lucky Twala and expelled three MPs, Mpho Ramakatsa, Andile Mngxitama and Khanyisile Litchfield-Tshabalala. Mngxitama formed his own party, named Black First Land First (BLF), while Litchfield-Tshabalala joined the United Democratic Movement.\n\nThe EFF \"draws inspiration from the broad Marxist–Leninist tradition and Fanonian schools of thought in their analyses of the state, imperialism, culture and class contradictions in every society\", according to one of its declarations.\n\nIt criticises the African National Congress and their primary opposition, the Democratic Alliance, for their allegedly pro-business stances, which it claims have sold out the black people of South Africa to capitalism as cheap labour. It promises to tackle corruption, provide quality social housing, and provide free primary healthcare and education for all, as well as proposing to expropriate stolen land, nationalise the mining and banking sectors, double welfare grants and the minimum wage, and end the proposed toll system for highways.\n\nThe EFF takes significant inspiration from Thomas Sankara in terms of both style and ideology. In a May 2014 column, the prominent EFF member Jackie Shandu declared his party a \"proudly Sankarist formation\".\n\nThe EFF has been vocal in its criticism of black business owners and black owners of mining companies in South Africa. In an address at the Oxford Union in November 2015, Malema spoke out against billionaire mining company owner Patrice Motsepe. Further protests in 2015, the EFF delivered demands that included the socialization of the mining sector and called for more explicit targets for the 26% BEE ownership required by law.\n\nMalema addressed a crowd in Marikana, Rustenburg in the platinum mining area, blaming mining companies and calling out platinum mining company Lonmin in particular, for poverty in the region.\n\nThe party supports the re-introduction of the death penalty.\n\nIn 2016, after local elections in South Africa, the EFF has suggested that they will back the Democratic Alliance in hung-metro areas, but would not be entering into a coalition with any political party in South Africa.\n\nThe EFF was the only parliamentary party that opposed the 2018 political party funding bill.\n\nHigh-profile members of the Central Command Team include Floyd Shivambu, Fana Mokoena and Mbuyiseni Ndlozi (National Spokesperson). Controversial businessman Kenny Kunene joined the Central Command Team in July 2013 before resigning from the Central Command Team on 20 August 2013 and from the organisation on 26 August 2013. On 4 November 2013, it was announced that Dali Mpofu had left the African National Congress (ANC) after 33 years of membership and joined the EFF.\n\nAccording to a November 2013 Ipsos survey, the party's supporters are younger than average, with 49% being younger than 24, overwhelmingly black (99%) and mostly male, with women representing only 33% of the support base. A disproportionate number of supporters live in Malema's home province of Limpopo (28%), while only 1% live in KwaZulu-Natal, a more populous province.\n\nThe party was expected to make an impact in the 2014 general election, taking between 4 per cent and 8 per cent of the national vote. This was potentially enough for the party to hold the balance of power in provinces where the governing African National Congress was in danger of losing its absolute majority. In fact, the ANC retained its absolute majority, but the EFF moved into third place, surging past the shrinking Inkatha Freedom Party, with a 6.35% share of the vote to the IFP's 2.40%.\n\n!Election\n!Total votes\n!Share of vote\n!Seats \n!Government\n!2014\n\n!Election\n!Total # ofseats won\n!2014\n\n!Election\n!Votes\n!2016\n\n!rowspan=2|Election\n!colspan=2|Eastern Cape\n!colspan=2|Free State\n!colspan=2|Gauteng\n!colspan=2|Kwazulu-Natal\n!colspan=2|Limpopo\n!colspan=2|Mpumalanga\n!colspan=2|North-West\n!colspan=2|Northern Cape\n!colspan=2|Western Cape\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!2014\n\nOn 6 August 2015 the EFF announced that it has secured a Constitutional court case for its Jacob Zuma campaign of \"#PayBackTheMoney\". The case was heard on the 9 February 2016. The Judgement was released by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. The judgement stated that The President has violated the Constitution of South Africa, along with the Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete. The President was given 60 days to fulfill the requirements of the Public Protector Thuli Madonsela.\n\nOn 27 February 2018 the EFF tabled a motion in The National Assembly to amend the Constitution so as to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation. The motion, brought by the EFF leader Julius Malema, was adopted with a vote of 241 in support, and 83 against. The only parties who did not support the motion were the Democratic Alliance, Freedom Front Plus, Cope and the ACDP. Land Expropriation is one of the EFF's Seven cardinal pillars.\n\nIn 2018, the student wing of the EFF, the EFF Student Command won many universities across the country. The red berets defeated the ANC-aligned South African Students Congress (Sasco) at the Durban University of Technology, the University of Zululand and Mangosuthu University of Technology. They also won in Cape Town, the District Six, Mowbray and Bellville Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) campuses with landslide victories, meaning they now are in charge of the institution's SRC. They also won the University of Cape Town. Peter Keetse, president of the EFFSC, said the win was a warning shot for what was going to happen in 2019 national general elections. He said the youth were the influencers of the future, “therefore, this is an indication of what is to follow”.\n\nThe ANC has accused the Zimbabwean ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF), of supporting the EFF in order to destabilise the ANC.\n\nFeminists and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa have criticised the party's militarism and \"military command structure\".\n\nIn mid-June 2016 a group calling themselves \"Anonymous Africa\", claiming to be associated with the hacktivist group Anonymous, perpetrated a DDoS attack on the EFF's website stating the reason for the attack was the party's \"nationalist socialist rhetoric\". The South African Communist Party also condemns this party.\n\nVusi Khoza, the party's candidate for Premier of KwaZulu-Natal, has a criminal conviction for his involvement in what was believed to be a xenophobic attack on foreigners at Albert Park, Durban in December 2009.\n\nFeminists have characterised leading members of the party as misogynist.\n\nThe EFF is widely criticised for inciting and perpetuating racism. South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission disqualified an EFF councillor in the 2016 local elections due to racism.\n\nIn February, 2016, during violent university protests characterised by arson and vandalism, EFF Youth leader Omphile Seleke posted instructions for making petrol bombs on social media.\n\nMalema stated at a political rally in 2016 that “We [the EFF] are not calling for the slaughter of white people‚ at least for now\". When asked for comment by a news agency, the ANC spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa stated that there will be no comment from the ANC, as \"[h]e [Malema] was addressing his own party supporters.\" While still the ANCYL leader, Malema was taken to the Equality Court by AfriForum for repeatedly singing “dubul’ ibhunu”, which translate as “shoot the boer [white farmer]”. The ANC supported Malema, though AfriForum and the ANC reached a settlement before the appeal case was due to be argued in the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\nIn January 2018, EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu congratulated the Fighters for causing damage to various H&M stores across South Africa due to a picture of a young Black child wearing a green hoodie reading, \"Coolest Monkey in the Jungle.\"\n\nJulius Malema leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters stated at a political rally in 2018 that \"\"Go After A White Man... We Are Cutting The Throat Of Whiteness\"\" This led to the Democratic Alliance accusing the EFF's leader, Malema, of racism and not sharing the more tolerant views of South Africans broadly.\n\nThe EFF was criticised by the South African Council of Churches, Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, and the ANC for comparing Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan to a \"dog\" whilst protesting the Zondo Commission inquiry into government corruption and stating that anti-corruption investigations were being implemented by an \"Indian cabal.\"\n\nIn October 2018 a group of 17 former EFF members and councillors in the Northern Cape accused the party's senior leadership of corruption and sexual exploitation of more junior female party members.\n\nAn investigation by the amaBhungane centre for investigative journalism stated that the EFF received R500,000 in kickbacks from a company in return for a R1.26 billion contract to manage a fleet of vehicles used by the City of Johannesburg with tacit acquiescence of the Democratic Alliance.\n\nFollowing the publication of a South African Reserve Bank report into the collapse of VBS Mutual Bank implicating EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu's brother media reports came out alleging that Shivambu received R10 million in illicit payments from VBS prior to it placed under curatorship in March 2018. Prior to the publication of the Reserve Bank's report the EFF criticised the Reserve Bank for placing VBS under curatorship and accused it of victimising VBS on racial grounds. The EFF stated that it had seen no evidence that Shivambu received the R10 million and called for government to recapitalise VBS Mutual Bank whilst also taking legal action against those mentioned in the Reserve Bank report. A followup investigation by the Daily Maverick alleged that the EFF illicitly received R1.8 million of VBS money through a network of proxy companies with the party's leadership (notably Shivambu and Malema) also illicitly reviving money though this network.\n\n\n\n"}

Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. Over time, a complex web of gateways and routing systems linked many of them. Many US universities were part of the ARPANET, which aimed at software portability between its systems. That portability helped make the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) increasingly influential.\n\nFor a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the X.400 email system, part of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), would predominate. However, once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995, a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP, POP3 and IMAP email protocols the standard.\n\nEarly dedicated machines and networks for sending text messages existed in the form of the telegraph, Telex and AUTODIN.\n\nTelex became an operational teleprinter service in 1933, and after 1945 spread around the world.\n\nThe AUTODIN network, first operational in 1962, provided a message service between 1,350 terminals, handling 30 million messages per month, with an average message length of approximately 3,000 characters. By 1968, AUTODIN linked more than 300 sites in several countries.\n\nWith the introduction of MIT's Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) in 1961, for the first time multiple users could log into a central system from remote terminals, and store and share files on the central disk. Informal methods of using this to pass messages were soon developed and expanded:\n\nDevelopers of other early systems developed similar email applications:\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, networked personal computers on LANs became increasingly important. Server-based systems similar to the earlier mainframe systems were developed. Examples include:\nEventually these systems could link different organizations as long as each organization ran the same email system and proprietary protocol.\n\nTo facilitate electronic mail exchange between remote sites and with other organizations, telecommunication links, such as dialup modems or leased lines, provided means to transport email globally, creating local and global networks. This was challenging for a number of reasons, including the widely different email address formats in use. \n\nEarly interoperability among independent systems included:\n\nIn the early 1970s, Ray Tomlinson updated an existing utility called SNDMSG so that it could copy messages (as files) over the network. Lawrence Roberts, the project manager for the ARPANET development, took the idea of READMAIL, which dumped all \"recent\" messages onto the user's terminal, and wrote a programme for TENEX in TECO macros called \"RD\", which permitted access to individual messages. Barry Wessler then updated RD and called it \"NRD\".\n\nMarty Yonke rewrote NRD to include reading, access to SNDMSG for sending, and a help system, and called the utility \"WRD\", which was later known as \"BANANARD\". John Vittal then updated this version to include three important commands: \"Move\" (combined save/delete command), \"Answer\" (determined to whom a reply should be sent) and \"Forward\" (sent an email to a person who was not already a recipient). The system was called \"MSG\". With inclusion of these features, MSG is considered to be the first integrated modern email programme, from which many other applications have descended.\n\nExperimental email transfers between separate computer systems began shortly after the creation of the ARPANET in 1969. Ray Tomlinson is generally credited as having sent the first email across a network, initiating the use of the \"@\" sign to separate the names of the user and the user's machine in 1971, when he sent a message from one Digital Equipment Corporation DEC-10 computer to another DEC-10. The two machines were placed next to each other. Tomlinson's work was quickly adopted across the ARPANET, which significantly increased the popularity of email. Tomlinson is internationally known as the inventor of modern email.\n\nInitially addresses were of the form, \"username@hostname\" but were extended to \"username@host.domain\" with the development of the Domain Name System (DNS).\n\nAs the influence of the ARPANET spread across academic communities, gateways were developed to pass mail to and from other networks such as CSNET, JANET, BITNET, X.400, and FidoNet. This often involved addresses such as:\nwhich routes mail to a user with a \"bang path\" address at a UUCP host.\n\n"}

Apple licensed the core technology from fusionOne. It ran only under Mac OS X and was used to synchronize contact and calendar data from Address Book and iCal with many non-Apple SyncML-enabled mobile phones via a Bluetooth or USB connection. Support for many (pre-October 2007) devices was built-in, with newer devices being supported via manufacturer and third-party iSync Plugins. Support for Palm OS organizers and compatible smartphones was removed with the release of iSync 3.1 and Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. BlackBerry OS, Palm OS, and Windows Mobile (Pocket PC) devices could not be used with iSync, but were supported by third-party applications. Before the release of Mac OS X 10.4, iSync also synchronized a user's Safari bookmarks with the then .Mac subscription service provided by Apple.\n\nStarting with Mac OS X 10.4, much of iSync's original syncing functionality had been moved into the Sync Services framework, which developers can use to incorporate synchronization into their own applications. iSync, however, retained responsibility for the setup, configuration and synchronising of supported mobile handsets. Since the release of iTunes 4.8, the user interface for synchronizing iPods had been delegated to iTunes, although conflict-resolution and substantial changes to contact information (>5%) shows use of iSync. Synchronization with MobileMe (previously .Mac) was then the domain of MobileMe Sync, accessible through a System Preferences pane.\n\niSync was removed from Mac OS X in version 10.7 (Lion). However, since the underlying framework still existed in Lion and 10.8 (Mountain Lion), it was possible to restore the functionality of iSync using a 10.6 (Snow Leopard) installation or backup.\n\n\n"}

The volumes span the reigns of thirty-two popes from Pope Nicholas III to Pope Clement VII. The volumes relating to the Avignon Popes (1305—1387) as well as the following antipopes were moved from Comtat Venaissin to the Secret Archives in 1783.\n\nThe records include both the books in which an array of Curial officials recorded receipts and expenditures, and general annual accounts of items. They were recorded in journal form until 1378, denoting the expenditures of each subset of the papal household, military expenses, construction costs, and art commissioning. However, \"Introitus et Exitus\" is fundamentally an incomplete record of the financial dealings of the Holy See, as the Apostolic Camera itself represents only the surplusses of various regional transactions, and popes conducted significant financial dealings off balance sheet. Notably, these records often exclude direct cash payments made by popes themselves or mediated through the Curia's Bank of the Holy Spirit.\n\nBecause of the thoroughness of the records down to the minutest details, they have been used by historians to establish the daily living conditions in the papal household and the administration of the Papal States. The records have been utilized by art historians, notably Eugène Müntz, to determine the number of artists who contributed to certain works, authenticate works of unknown origin, and to discover previously unknown works. They have also been scoured by economic historians to study past European exchange rates and interest rates. The sudden appearance of debts from the Apostolic Camera to Cardinals Campofregoso, Domenico della Rovere, Sanseverino, and Orsini after a gap in the records in August 1492 has been used to allege that simony occurred in the papal conclave, 1492.\n\nOther records of the Apostolic Camera include \"Liber Censuum\" (492—1192), \"Obligationes et Solutiones\", \"Obligationes communes\", \"Collectoriae\", and \"Diversae Cameralia\"; the artificially created \"Registra Vaticana\" includes documents of the Camera mixed with those of the Chancery of Apostolic Briefs, and other secretariats; the \"Registra Avenionensia\" catalogs materials relating jointly to the Chancery and the Camera.\n\n"}

After announcing his desire to retire from the throne, the emperor began building a retirement suite, the Palace of Tranquil Longevity, in the northeast corner of the Forbidden City. This complex, also called the Qianlong Garden, was built with the highest quality and designed with the most exceptional Chinese techniques. Juanqinzhai was an imperial lodge in the north end of the garden, and contains rare examples of murals painted on silk and bamboo craftsmanship.\n\nIn 2002, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) began a partnership with the Palace Museum to restore the Qianlong Garden. The first of the 27 pavilions to be restored was the Juanqinzhai, which was completed in 2008. Because of the huge success of this restoration, the partnership has been extended so that each of the other 26 buildings in the garden can be fully restored.\n\nJuanqinzhai was built as part of the Palace of Tranquil Longevity in the Forbidden City. Emperor Qianlong ruled from the Forbidden City in Beijing, where he presided over the zenith of the Qing Dynasty. Art and architecture flourished during his reign and China reached a new peak of wealth and culture. The Qianlong Emperor's passion for painting, sculpture and embroidery extended to his palaces. Even late in his reign, when the Qianlong Garden was being built, the emperor's passion for art was displayed in the beautiful decoration of the pavilions and halls there. Qianlong's grandfather Kangxi's long and impressive reign so intimidated the Qianlong Emperor that he refused to out-reign his grandfather. In 1772, in anticipation of his planned retirement, Qianlong ordered the construction of a small retreat. These small buildings were much different from the monumental buildings in the Outer Court and were much more intimate. However, these buildings remained as dignified and noble as the governmental buildings, as they would be still be the home and office of the Retired Qianlong Emperor.\n\nAfter the completion of the imperial residence, the emperor prepared to move into his new home. Qianlong abdicated in 1796, leaving the throne to his son, who would reign as the Jiaqing Emperor. However, between 1796 and 1799, Qianlong continued to effectively rule China behind the scenes, and his son was emperor in name only. Despite the creation of the beautiful gardens and buildings of the Palace of Tranquil Longevity, Qianlong never moved into his new suite, and remained in the traditional residence of the emperors. After the emperors death, an edict was produced ordering that no one could rebuild or change the designs of the garden, preserving it untouched. This edict is one of the main reasons that the original eighteenth century interiors remained in the Juanqinzhai and other buildings of the garden. When the last emperor was removed from the Forbidden City in 1924, the doors of the Qianlong Garden and many other halls of the Forbidden City were locked and forgotten.\n\nIn 2001, after years of neglect, the World Monuments Fund began a partnership with the Palace Museum in Beijing to restore the Qianlong Garden. The project, which cost 18 million, is slated to be finished in 2019, in time for the 600th anniversary of the construction of the Forbidden City (2020). Juanqinzhai's murals, which are the only large ensemble of eighteenth illusionist painting in China, were removed from their backing, and painstakingly cleaned. After much searching, the conservators found a source of paper for the new backing. This paper was made using traditional materials rather than modern techniques, which is revolutionary for a Chinese restoration. In China, \"historic preservation usually entails razing a structure and replacing it with a brightly painted replica.\"\n\nIn Suzhou, the same city where Qianlong himself ordered silks, dozens or workers labored extensively to produce the beautiful screens that decorate the reception room and the theater room. Each of the embroideries were carefully sewn by hand, even the unique double-sided transparent screens in the audience hall. Like the paper, a trial and error process was used to produce the brocade on the various thrones and tables. It took many tries to replicate the Qing dynasty \"cloud brocade\" which was used extensively in Juanqinzhai. Finally, a carver of inner skin bamboo was found to carve the deer in relief in the audience hall. The restoration of Juanqinzhai was lauded throughout China and the West as a milestone in the history of restoration, especially in the Forbidden City. The Chinese team even raised another $5 million to help with the restoration of the other 26 buildings of the Qianlong Garden.\n\nThough he never stayed in Juanqinzhai, Qianlong still planned the Palace of Tranquil Longevity as his personal retreat, filled with his favorite designs and motifs. From the eastern entrance, the emperor entered a large, two storied audience room, paneled with bamboo and silk screens. On the lower half of the screen is a carving of deer playing amongst pines and rocks, while the top half of each partition is decorated with an intricate, semi-transparent silk screen. In the center of lower level sits a formal throne, embroidered in imperial yellow and flanked by traditional Chinese couplets. Behind the partitions are an enfilade of rooms, filled with calligraphy, artworks, and mirrors. On both floors, the emperor had a set of private rooms and thrones, each filled with natural light, due to the semi-transparent silk screens, which also appear on both levels.\n\nOn the western half of Juanqinzhai is the \"Theater Room.\" In this section, a small pavilion equipped with a stage is surrounded by a bamboo fence and is faced by another two-floored viewing platform, from which the emperor could watch opera or plays. The pavilion and fence bring to mind the outdoors, and the warm colors of the bamboo and the light from the windows bring the feeling of summer into this room. Though the room has a warm and informal feel, the ideals of the Forbidden City are still present in the room. Like the columns in the main halls in the Outer Court, the faux bamboo is made of a rare nanmu tree, painted to look like bamboo. Despite this expensive touch, the piece-de-resistance of the room are the floor to ceiling trompe-l'œil murals hung here. On the wall the bamboo fence is replicated in paint, and behind it stands a large pavilion with trees and birds. Mimicking the real bamboo fence, the mural also contains a circular \"moon gate,\" where a crane stands watch. On the ceiling is a bamboo lattice motif, interlaced with vibrant grapevines. Here, the emperor could entertain his passion for art, gardening, and opera throughout the year.\n"}

It is currently part of the collections at The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.\n\nIn November 1928 the Franklin Institute received the pieces of a brass machine. It came from the descendants of John Penn Brock, a family who knew that at some time it had been able to write and draw pictures. Having been in a fire, its restoration involved a considerable amount of work. The Brock family believed that the machine had been made in France by an inventor named Maelzel. \nThe original writing instrument, either a quill or a brush, was replaced with a stylographic fountain pen. Once repaired the automaton began to produce elaborate sketches and poems. In the border surrounding the final poem, the automaton wrote, \"Ecrit par L'Automate de Maillardet\", translating to \"Written by the automaton of Maillardet\".\n\nRestorer and paper engineer Andrew Baron spent about 70 hours in 2007 repairing the Maillardet automaton to bring it back to working order.\n\nDuring the early nineteenth century, Maillardet exhibited this automaton and other automata that he created throughout England, and to other countries in Europe as far as Saint Petersburg, Russia. The following is a partial list of known exhibitions of the Maillardet's automaton. The automaton was mostly known as the \"Juvenile Artist\" in those exhibitions:\n\nThe Maillardet's automaton is a highlight of the \"Amazing Machine\" permanent exhibit at The Franklin Institute. The exhibition includes more than two dozen rarely displayed machines with exploded views of the machines to show their components such as gears, cams, pulleys and linkages. The Maillardet's automaton is always on display but the staff operate it only a few times a year for public demonstrations. The demonstrations show all seven drawings of the automaton as seen in the followings:\n\nThe pictures of Maillardet's automaton are among other artifacts in the collections of Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The museum has a collection of machines in pre-computer era. Particularly for Maillardet's, the museum highlights the use of its cams in similar function to read-only memory (ROM) of computer to store pre-defined data for retrieval at a later time. In Maillardet's automaton case, it stores motion data necessary to write a poem on paper. It is believed to be the largest cam-based memory of any automaton of the era. The information capacity of the automaton to hold 7 images within the machine was calculated to be 299,040 points, almost 300 kilobits of storage.\n\nThe Massachusetts Historical Society holds a drawing created in 1835 by an automaton in the collections of papers and artwork of the Minot family. The drawing is untitled with a depiction of Cupid. The writing on the picture indicated that it was drawn by Maelzel's automaton which was known at the time as the \"Maelzel's Juvenile Artist\". It is believed that at least one member of the Minot family witnessed the drawing by the Juvenile Artist at the exhibition of Johann Nepomuk Maelzel's automata in Boston on April 29, 1835. The Massachusetts Historical Society theorizes that the Juvenile Artist may in fact be the Maillardet's automaton. An explanation is that Maelzel might have acquired the automaton in the 1830s. As in other automata in his collection, they were known at the time as Maelzel's. After Maelzel's death, the automaton could have been auctioned off in Philadelphia to pay his debts. The new owner then attributed it to Maelzel.\n\n"}

The main goal of the organisation is to establish a sovereign Naga state, \"Nagalim\", which would consist of all the areas inhabited by the Naga people in Northeast India and Northwest Myanmar. According to the NSCN manifesto, their slogan is \"Nagaland for Christ\". The group is accused of kidnapping, assassination, forced conversion and committing terrorist activities.\n\nTwo major factions of NSCN include NSCN (K), led by Khaplang; and NSCN (I-M), led by Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muviah. On November 6, 2015 in response to an attack on an army convoy in Manipur India designated The NSCN (K) a terrorist organization under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. India's Ministry of Home Affairs labels NSCN a major insurgent group.\n\nThe word \"Naga\" denotes several ethnic tribes living on the Himalayan Range in Northeast India, which were brought under the control of British India during the 19th century. After India's independence, some Naga leaders tried to assert independence. In 1975, the separatist Naga National Council (NNC) gave up violence and signed the Shillong Accord with the Government of India. Some of the NNC leaders disapproved of this peace treaty: these leaders included Isak Chishi Swu of Sumi (Sema) tribe, Thuingaleng Muivah of Tangkhul tribe and S. S. Khaplang. These leaders formed the NSCN as a new separatist organization, which has been described as a Maoist breakaway group of the Naga National Council. NSCN started an underground Naga Federal government having both civil and military wings. Later, a disagreement surfaced within the outfit leaders over the issue of commencing dialogue with the Indian Government. On 30 April 1988, the NSCN split into two factions; the NSCN-K led by Khaplang, and the NSCN-IM, led by Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah. The split was accompanied by a spate of violence and clashes between the factions.\n\nOn 6 April 2015 a new faction NSCN (Reformation) was formed. Y. Wangtin Konyak and P. Tikhak officially announced the formation of a new Naga political group going by the name 'National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Reformation)' or NSCN (R). The decision came after Wangtin Konyak, a senior minister (Kilonser) and personal secretary to Khaplang and Tikhak, the spokesperson of the outfit were expelled by Khaplang after misunderstanding arose over the recent abrogation of ceasefire with the Government of India.\n\nThe duo, wanted to continue with the ceasefire maintaining that \"violence has never served a good purpose and the Naga political problem can only be resolved through peace and negotiation\" while Khaplang had it abrogated because the \"14 years of ceasefire between NSCN (K) and India has become a mockery and futile exercise.\" The primary agenda of the new NSCN-R would be to \"develop a sense of brotherhood among the Naga family and to rebuild the trust and faith among the Naga society.\n\nOn 3 August 2015 NSCN leader T Muivah signed a peace accord with the Government of India in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and NSA Ajit Doval. However, NSCN also joined with a militia organization named the United Liberation Front of Western South East Asia, along with other Northeast Indian terrorist groups, and shortly after broke off peace talks with the Indian government. It also was responsible for the 2015 Manipur ambush, in which 18 soldiers of the Indian army were killed and 15 were wounded.\n\nThe objective of the NSCN was to establish a Sovereign, Naga State by unifying all the Naga-inhabited areas in the North East of India and Northern Burma which the organisation and the people of the area proposed as Nagalim. Unification of all Naga tribes under one administration and 'liberating' Nagalim from India is listed as one of the supposed main objectives of the organisation. Its manifesto is based on the principle of Socialism for economic development.\n\nJournalist Bertil Lintner has described NSCN's ideology as \"a mixture of evangelical Christianity and revolutionary socialism\". NSCN, and later NSCN (I-M), have explicitly stated that their vision of a sovereign Nagaland is a Christian one. The NSCN (I-M) manifesto envisages the formation of an \"Independent Sovereign Christian Socialist Democratic Republic\".\n\nNSCN is active in North East India. The state of Nagaland and the hill districts in Manipur inhabited by the Nagas are the main areas where strong influence and presence of the organisation is felt. Its presence in neighbouring states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh are also widely acknowledged. On the international level, the presence and influence of the NSCN in the Northern part of Myanmar that are inhabited by the Naga tribes dates back to the time when the Nagas started their freedom struggle.\n\nLate Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah, the founding fathers of NSCN-IM, was Chairman and General Secretary of NSCN-IM respectively and S. S. Khaplang is the Chairman of the NSCN-K.\n\nOn the political front, the NSCN-IM has divided its area of influence into 11 regions based on sub-tribe considerations and administrative convenience. In many areas, it runs a parallel government. There are four major ‘Ministries’ – Defence, Home, Finance and Foreign Affairs. Moreover, there are five other Ministries including Education, Information and Publicity, Forests and Minerals, Law and Justice and Religious Affairs. The most prominent among the Ministries is the ‘Home ministry’, which is considered as a replacement of the Indian State government machinery. The heads of 11 administrative regions report to the ‘Home Minister’ (Kilo Kilonser). The devolution of administrative arms of the organisation goes down to the town and village levels in the NSCN-IM’s areas of influence.\n\nThe outfit has also established a government-in-exile called the Government of the People’s Republic of Nagaland/Nagalim (GPRN) which, interacts with formal and non-formal world bodies and media. The GPRN sends emissaries abroad to garner support and raise funds for the Naga cause.\n\nOver the years, the NSCN-IM has tried to develop extensive linkages both within and outside India. It is alleged that Pakistan and China are providing finance as well as arms and ammunition to NSCN in their fight for independence against the Indian Government. The group was previously backed by India’s intelligence agencies to weaken the main Naga insurgency.\n\nIt is believed that NSCN patronised smaller extremists outfits in the North East of India by giving warfare and intelligence trainings and providing logistics for waging war against India.NSCN had also extreme links with its extremist partner ZRF and ZRO.\n\nThe outfit has also opened up contacts with international organizations like the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) at the Hague and the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations (UNWGIP).\n\nChina is also instrumental in providing training and arms, which was established after the arrest of the top NSCN IM leader Anthony Shimray. After his arrest by the Indian intelligence agencies he also revealed that he was tasked by Chinese intelligence agencies to collect and gather intelligence on Indian troop deployments in north eastern states of India. Further it is also alleged that NSCN is the major faction that helps many other minor militant outfits in north east and is widely accepted as the main reason of continued insurgency in north eastern states of Indian republic.\n\nOn 4 June 2015, NSCN-K and KYKL ambushed an Indian Army convoy of 6 Dogra Regiment in Chandel district of Manipur and killed 18 Army jawans. On 10 June India conducted surgical strikes against militant camps for both groups along the Indo-Myanmar international border, and inflicted significant casualties. Indian media reported the casualty figure is up to 158.\n\n\n"}

The company was launched in 1972. NewsBank was then bought from Naisbitt by Daniel S. Jones, who subsequently became its president. Naisbitt left NewsBank in 1973.\n\nIn 1986 NewsBank had one-hundred employees in-house. Another one-hundred employees worked from home and would travel to the company's headquarters, bring back newspapers to their residence from there, and then come back to the company with indexed information on these publications. The company's headquarters in 1986 was in New Canaan, Connecticut. Chris Andrews was brought on in 1986 as Product Manager for CD-ROM. His job was to help the company transition from a paper format of delivery to libraries, to instead provide its indexes and full-text articles on CD-ROM format. The subscription price for this service initially was US$5,000 per library. Visitors to libraries with the new CD-ROM services found that their research time searching through the CD-ROM index instead of paper indexes was cut down from 30 minutes to five minutes. NewsBank used an arbitrary selection process for determining which news articles the company considered worthy for archiving; it based this on those that were not simply stories of regional interest and that were more widely appealing to a larger potential audience of future researchers.\n\nIn 1992 NewsBank had difficulty providing its users with a method to search for information based upon a specific geographic position. Newspaper results were listed by subject matter first and then subsequently by location. At the time it indexed articles via microfiche from more than 400 media publications in the United States. The company announced in 1993 that it would provide a CD-ROM product indexing full-text of newspapers from 35 publications including \"The Christian Science Monitor\", \"The Washington Post\", \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Dallas Morning News\", \"Chicago Tribune\", \"The Boston Globe\", and \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\". In 1994 NewsBank was the only company to provide access to an index to periodical literature in the subject of theater. The only method accessible at the time to researchers in the field was \"NewsBank's Review of the Arts: Performing Arts\". NewsBank provided access to this service via CD-ROM. NewsBank started compiling the full-text of articles related to the local economy of geographic areas and providing this information via CD-ROM to its clients in 1994. The privately held company was cited by \"The Information Advisor\" as bringing in annual revenue of approximately $19 million, and employing a staff of 350 people. By 1998, NewsBank provided indexes via CD-ROM to newspaper articles from over 450 cities in the United States.\n\nIn 2000, NewsBank merged with Readex. With the closure of the merger, NewsBank had acquired one of the earliest organizations to archive microform in America. In 2001 NewsBank compiled the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) Index and made it available via CD-ROM. NewsBank joined forces with Micromedia, Ltd., a division of IHS Canada, to help distribute its products in 2001. In 2004 NewsBank maintained archival access to hundreds of media references from the period of 1996 to current day. In 2005 NewsBank was structured in a pay-for-use format, with access differentiated for different types of users including public libraries, public schools, as well as higher education settings.\n\nNewsBank reached an agreement in 2011 with \"The Daily Northwestern\" newspaper of Northwestern University to archive all of its historical publications. The task would archive more than 90,000 pages of total material from the school. It included a plan to archive not just \"The Daily Northwestern\" but also prior related publications from a time period of 1871 to 2000, and index this material so it could be keyword searchable on the Internet. Dan Jones, President and CEO of NewsBank, had a prior relationship with the university at the time, serving as University trustee and president-elect of the Northwestern Alumni Association.\n\nIn 2013 NewsBank provided users with its service Access World News—which \"Reference Skills for the School Librarian\" called the \"world's largest full-text news database\". According to the book \"Communication and Language Analysis in the Public Sphere\", in 2014 NewsBank contained \"over 990 news sources, with each state in the U.S. represented, as well as national publications, television and radio programs.\"\n\nThe 2004 book \"Reference Sources in History\" by Ronald H. Fritze, Brian E. Coutts, and Louis Andrew Vyhnanek wrote that: \"NewsBank is one of the world's largest information providers.\" In her book \"Journalism: A Guide to the Reference Literature\" (2004), Jo A. Cates said: \"NewsBank is a massive database, the NewsFile Collection alone providing access to full text articles in more than 500 newspapers, wire services, and broadcasts.\" The 2013 book \"Reference Skills for the School Librarian\" by authors Ann Marlow Riedling, Loretta Shake, and Cynthia Houston called NewsBank a \"popular indexing series\". They pointed out that NewsBank provided access to \"an easy-to-search database of articles, activities, and lesson plans for the elementary and middle grades, covering key issues and events in every subject area.\"\n\n\n"}

The charm is intended for the treatment of poisoning and infection by a preparation of nine herbs. The numbers nine and three, significant in Germanic paganism and later Germanic folklore, are mentioned frequently within the charm. The poem contains references to Christian and English Pagan elements, including a mention of the major Germanic god Woden.\n\nAccording to R. K. Gordon, the poem is \"clearly an old heathen thing which has been subjected to Christian censorship.\" Malcolm Laurence Cameron states that chanting the poem aloud results in a \"marvellously incantatory effect\".\n\nThe charm references nine herbs:\n\nAt the end of the charm, prose instructions are given to take the above-mentioned herbs, crush them to dust, and to mix them with old soap and apple juice. Further instructions are given to make a paste from water and ashes, boil fennel into the paste, bathe it with beaten egg – both before and after the prepared salve is applied.\n\nFurther, the charm directs the reader to sing the charm three times over each of the herbs as well as the apple before they are prepared, into the mouth of the wounded, both of their ears, and over the wound itself prior to the application of the salve.\n\nThe poem contains one of two Old English mentions of \"Woden\" in Old English poetry; the other is \"Maxims I\" of the \"Exeter Book\". The paragraph reads as follows:\nSuggestions have been made that this passage describes Woden coming to the assistance of the herbs through his use of nine twigs, each twig inscribed with the runic first-letter initial of a plant.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "905123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=905123", "title": "Stanislaus Zbyszko", "text": "Stanislaus Zbyszko\n\nJan Stanisław Cyganiewicz (April 1, 1879 – September 23, 1967), better known by the ring name Stanislaus Zbyszko, was a Polish strongman and professional wrestler 2-time World Heavyweight Champion at his highest profile in the United States during the 1920s. The surname Zbyszko was only a nickname, which was given him by friends due to his bravery when he was a child - it was the name of a fictional medieval Polish knight from the historical novel \"The Knights of the Cross\" by Henryk Sienkiewicz. He was the brother of Wladek Zbyszko.\n\nStanislaus Cyganiewicz was born on April 1, 1879 in Jodłowa near Kraków, Poland. A noted intellectual, he studied music, philosophy, and law while growing up in Vienna, Austria. He also possessed gifted strength; and he joined the renowned Vindobona Athletic Club while in college, where he gradually developed an imposing physique. In addition, he also practiced in the Sokol (“Falcon”), a Polish patriotic gymnastic society, which centered on the physical, mental, and cultural advancement of the nation’s citizens while instilling discipline and a love of country. Around the turn-of-the-century, Cyganiewicz first encountered the wrestling industry when he used his great power to successfully defeat an experienced grappler at a local circus in Poland. Standing just 5'8\", Cyganiewicz was built like a house, carrying 260 pounds of chiseled muscle; and he was soon recruited to Berlin by a local promoter. As fellow strongman George Hackenschmidt established himself as Europe’s premier grappling star, Cyganiewicz was thus attracted to a career in wrestling as well; and he was subsequently introduced to the professional game by the Polish grappler , who eventually became his mentor.\n\nOver the next few years, Cyganiewicz gradually established himself among Europe’s fastest-rising Greco-Roman wrestlers while competing in a number of tournaments; and by 1903, Health & Strength listed him among the continent’s leading heavyweights. He eventually took the ring name Stanislaus Zbyszko; and in 1906, he battled Russia’s \"Cossack\" Ivan Poddubny to a two-hour draw before then outlasting George Lurich and Constant le Marin to win a prestigious Paris tournament. He was next brought to England by Charles \"C.B.\" Cochrane, who was previously Hackenschmidt’s manager; and he engaged in a series of prominent encounters against Turkey's \"Champion of the Bosphorus\" Kara Suliman while performing at the London Pavilion and the Gibbons music halls. However, he was soon embroiled in a major controversy when Suliman was revealed to be Bulgaria's Ivan Offtharoff, who was actually employed by Zbyszko and Cochrane in one of the earliest public revelations of wrestling's \"theatrical hoaxes\".\n\nAs Zbyszko started to compete more often in England and the United States, he increasingly began to make the switch to catch-as-catch-can freestyle wrestling; and for several years, he alternated between grappling styles as he traveled between continents and countries. Already billed as Europe’s Greco-Roman champion, he was subsequently recognized among the world’s top catch wrestlers when he fought Frank Gotch to a one-hour draw in November 1909 in Buffalo, NY. The following year, he scored heralded victories over Dr. Ben Roller and “the Terrible Turk” Youssuf Mahmout, thus confirming his reputation among the world’s elite grapplers while also setting up a huge second encounter with Gotch at the Chicago Coliseum on June 1, 1910 for the undisputed World Heavyweight Championship. However, in the rematch, Gotch tricked Zbyszko, jumping him when Zbyszko walked out for what was in Europe the customary handshake, and pinning him in just 6.4 seconds. Zbyszko was infuriated and protested the result, but the match went on and Gotch took the second fall in just under 30 minutes. The performance led many fans to believe the bout was a work (although Gotch would never again face Zbyszko during his career).\n\nDespite the controversial loss, Zbyszko was now regarded among the premier wrestlers in the world; and he would then take on the mammoth challenge of India's feared Great Gama, an undefeated champion who had been unsuccessful in his attempts to lure Frank Gotch into a match. And so, on September 10, 1910, Zbyszko faced the Great Gama in the finals of the John Bull World Championships in London. The match was £250 in prize money and the John Bull Belt. Within a minute, Zbyszko was taken down and remained in that position for the remaining 2 hours and 35 minutes of the match. There were a few brief moments when Zbyszko would get up, but he just ended back down in his previous position. Crafting a defensive strategy of hugging the mat in order to nullify Great Gama’s greatest strengths, Zbyszko wrestled the Indian legend to a draw after nearly three hours of grappling, though Zbyszko’s lack of tenacity angered many of the fans in attendance. Nevertheless, Zbyszko still became one of the few wrestlers to ever meet the Great Gama without going down in defeat; The two men were set to face each other again on September 17, 1910. On that date, Zbyszko failed to show up and Gama was announced the winner by default. He was awarded the prize and the John Bull Belt. Receiving this belt entitled Gama to be called Rustam-e-Zamana or World Champion. Over the next decade, he competed in Europe while his younger brother, Wladek Zbyszko, established himself among the top stars in the United States.\n\nIn 1927 it was announced that the Great Gama and Zbyszko would face each other again. The day finally came in 1928 when both wrestlers met again in Patiala. The result of the bout was, however, drawn quickly when Gama threw Zbyszko in only 42 seconds.\n\nBy this time, the industry had begun a gradual shift towards “worked” programs; and Stanislaus Zbyszko was eventually recruited back to the U.S. by the “Gold Dust Trio” of Strangler Lewis, Billy Sandow, and Toots Mondt. Though now in his early 40s, Zbyszko was booked to defeat Lewis for the World Title on May 6, 1921; but his reign was ultimately a bust at the box office, and he relinquished the title back to Lewis on March 3, 1922. Around this time, a disagreement caused Joe Stecher to split from the Gold Dust Trio promotion, thus forming a separate wrestling faction. Zbyszko remained with the Trio, who were promoting ex-football player Wayne Munn as a charismatic new champion. In order to build up Munn’s credibility, the Trio booked him to successfully defend the title against Zbyszko on April 15, 1925; however, Zbyszko had secretly accepted a payoff from Tony Stecher (Joe’s brother/manager) to switch to their company. Consequently, Zbyszko betrayed the Trio by turning the match with Munn into a legitimate shoot, pinning the non-wrestler again and again until the referee was forced to award the title to the 47-year-old veteran, who then dropped the title to Stecher a month later to complete the ploy. This was one of the last times a World Title changed hands legitimately; and the legacy of this conspiracy was momentous, as it would be decades before promoters would ever feel comfortable putting their title on a non-wrestler again, thus fueling the support for expert “hooker” Lou Thesz to serve as a champion throughout the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.\n\nIn 1928, Zbyszko received a lucrative offer to wrestle the Great Gama in a rematch of their bout from 18 years earlier. Despite both men now being well past their primes, the match purportedly drew 60,000 fans, who watched Great Gama defeat Zbyszko in just 40 seconds, leading many to speculate that Zbyszko was paid to do the job for Gama. Zbyszko then retired and actively scouted wrestling talent in South America, where he discovered soccer, rugby-player, boxer, wrestler and acrobatic gymnast Antonino Rocca, whom he developed into one of the sport’s biggest stars. From their Missouri farm, the Zbyszko brothers also trained future legends Johnny Valentine and Harley Race; and Stanislaus had a supporting role in the movie, \"Night and the City\" (1950). Knowing that a key role in the film was a grizzled Greco-Roman wrestling legend, director Jules Dassin said he \"didn't want to pick an actor and train him to be a wrestler -- I wanted to do the opposite. I had never gone to a wrestling match, but I had an image of a wrestler from my youth.\" The wrestler turned out to be Zbyszko. Dassin said, \"I was told he was dead, but it turned out he was alive and was a chicken farmer in New Jersey.\" He turned out to be \"a beautiful, cultured, multilingual man\" who looked like a graceful rock formation. During breaks in filming, Dassin would travel into town to watch experimental theatre; he later recalled that Zbyszko was the only other person who would tag along (the rest of the cast and crew balked at the invitation). Like the character he played in the movie, Zbyszko often complained of the industry’s evolution into a form of showmanship.\n\nOn September 23, 1967, Stanislaus Zbyszko died of a heart attack at age 88. He was cited by Strangler Lewis as one of the best legitimate wrestlers of all-time; and as a tribute, his surname was later adopted by Larry Zbyszko.\n\nIn 1983, Stanislaus Zbyszko was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}

It was discovered in August 1990, by Sue Hendrickson, an explorer and fossil collector, and was named after her. After ownership disputes were settled, the fossil was auctioned in October 1997, for US $8.3 million, the highest amount ever paid for a dinosaur fossil, and is now a permanent feature at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nDuring the summer of 1990, a group of workers from the Black Hills Institute, located in Hill City, searched for fossils at the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in western South Dakota near the city of Faith. By the end of the summer, the group had discovered \"Edmontosaurus\" bones and was ready to leave. However, a flat tire was discovered on their truck before the group could depart on August 12. While the rest of the group went into town to repair the truck, Sue Hendrickson decided to explore the nearby cliffs that the group had not checked. As she was walking along the base of a cliff, she discovered some small pieces of bone. She looked above her to see where the bones had originated, and observed larger bones protruding from the wall of the cliff. She returned to camp with two small pieces of the bones and reported the discovery to the president of the Black Hills Institute, Peter Larson. He determined that the bones were from a \"T. rex\" by their distinctive contour and texture. Later, closer examination of the site showed many visible bones above the ground and some articulated vertebrae. \n\nThe crew ordered extra plaster and, although some of the crew had to depart, Hendrickson and a few other workers began to uncover the bones. The group was excited, as it was evident that much of the dinosaur had been preserved. Previously discovered \"T. rex\" skeletons were usually missing over half of their bones. It was later determined that Sue was a record 90 percent complete by bulk, and 73% complete counting the elements. Scientists believe that this specimen was covered by water and mud soon after its death which prevented other animals from carrying away the bones. Additionally, the rushing water mixed the skeleton together. When the fossil was found the hip bones were above the skull and the leg bones were intertwined with the ribs. The large size and the excellent condition of the bones were also surprising. The skull was long, and most of the teeth were still intact. After the group completed excavating the bones, each block was covered in burlap and coated in plaster, followed by a transfer to the offices of The Black Hills Institute where they began to clean the bones.\n\nSoon after the fossils were found, a dispute arose over their legal ownership. The Black Hills Institute had obtained permission from the owner of the land, Maurice Williams, to excavate and remove the skeleton, and had, according to Larson, paid Williams for the remains. Williams later claimed that the money had not been for the sale of the fossil and that he had only allowed Larson to remove and clean the fossil for a later sale. Williams was a member of the Sioux tribe, and the tribe claimed the bones belonged to them. However, the property that the fossil had been found within was held in trust by the United States Department of the Interior.\n\nIn 1992, the FBI and the South Dakota National Guard raided the site where The Black Hills Institute had been cleaning the bones and seized the fossil, charging Larson on 158 points. The government transferred the remains to the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, where the skeleton was stored until the penal and civil legal disputes were settled. The United States Senate voted to not confirm the appointment of Kevin Schieffer as United States Attorney for the District of South Dakota after his controversial handling of the penal case. Larson was in 1996 convicted to a two year prison sentence on charges not directly related to Sue. After a lengthy civil case, the court decreed that Maurice Williams retained ownership, because as a beneficiary he was protected by the law against an impulsive selling of real property, and the remains were returned in 1995. \n\nWilliams then decided to sell the remains, and contracted with Sotheby's to auction the property. Many were then worried that the fossil would end up in a private collection where people would not be able to observe it. The Field Museum in Chicago was also concerned about this possibility, and decided to attempt to purchase Sue. However, the organization realized that they might have had difficulty securing funding and requested that companies and private citizens provide financial support. The California State University system, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, McDonald's, Ronald McDonald House Charities, and individual donors agreed to assist in purchasing Sue for The Field Museum. On October 4, 1997, the auction began at ; less than ten minutes later, The Field Museum had purchased the remains with the highest bid of . The final cost was . This is the highest amount ever paid for a dinosaur fossil.\n\nThe Field Museum hired a specialized moving company with experience in transporting delicate items to move the bones to Chicago. The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened Animal Kingdom in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from plastic to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for CT scanning of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so Boeing's Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death—the oldest \"T. rex\" known until Trix was found in 2013. A \"Nova\" episode said that the death occurred in a seasonal stream bed, which washed away some small bones. During life, this carnivore received several injuries and suffered from numerous pathologies. An injury to the right shoulder region of Sue resulted in a damaged shoulder blade, a torn tendon in the right arm due most likely from a struggle with prey, and three broken ribs. This damage subsequently healed (though one rib healed into two separate pieces), indicating Sue survived the incident. The left fibula is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture. \n\nMultiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur. A subsequent study found these to be areas of parasitic infection instead, possibly from an infestation of an ancestral form of \"Trichomonas gallinae\", a protozoan parasite that infests birds and ultimately leads to death by starvation due to internal swelling of the neck. Damage to the back end of the skull was interpreted early on as a fatal bite wound. Subsequent study by Field Museum paleontologists found no bite marks. The distortion and breakage seen in some of the bones in the back of the skull was likely caused by post-mortem trampling. Some of the tail vertebrae are fused in a pattern typical of arthritis due to injury. The animal is also believed to have suffered from gout. Scholars debate exactly how the animal died; the cause of death is ultimately unknown.\n\nAfter the bones were prepared, photographed and studied, they were sent to New Jersey where work began on making the mount. This work consists of bending steel to support each bone safely and to display the entire skeleton articulated as it was in life. The real skull was not incorporated into the mount as subsequent study would be difficult with the head off the ground. Parts of the skull had been crushed and broken, and thus appeared distorted. The museum made a cast of the skull, and altered this cast to remove the distortions, thus approximating what the original undistorted skull may have looked like. The cast skull was also lighter, allowing it to be displayed on the mount without the use of a steel upright under the head. The original skull is exhibited in a case that can be opened to allow researchers access for study.\n\nThe Sue exhibit opened on May 17, 2000, with more than 10,000 visitors. John Gurche, a paleoartist, painted a mural of a \"Tyrannosaurus\" for the exhibit.\n\nThe Field Museum is relocating Sue. The T. Rex's new location will be on the second floor, with a new exhibit dedicated to the specimen. Sue was moved in February 2018 and will be gone for about a year while the new exhibit is prepared. In the place of Sue within Stanley Field Hall is a mounted cast of a titanosaur skeleton, a \"Patagotitan\" dubbed \"Maximo\".\n\nWhen Sue was originally mounted in 2000, scientists used a small part of gastralia as a hypothetical furcula. The new mount will not only correct this with the proper furcula, it will mount the entire gastralia to the rest of the skeleton. The new exhibit is scheduled to open on December 21, 2018.\n\nSue has a length of , stands tall at the hips, and has been estimated at between in recent estimates. It has been estimated by Hutchinson et al. in 2011 at between , though the authors stated that their upper and lower estimates were based on models with wide error bars and that they \"consider them [these extremes] to be too skinny, too fat, or too disproportionate\". Another recent estimate portraying a leaner build placed the specimen at . Historically more out of date estimations placed this specimen as low as in weight. Sue's skull, which is displayed separately from the whole body display, weighs in at over . Of course, this weight represents the current mineralized fossil weight and the original weight would have been less. Currently this is the largest known complete tyrannosaur specimen on record.\n\nA 1997 episode of the PBS show \"Nova\", \"Curse of the T. Rex\", discussed the history of the discovery and ensuing legal challenges.\n\nDirector Todd Miller's documentary \"Dinosaur 13\", which is about Sue's discovery and subsequent legal actions, appeared at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIn 2015, an episode of NPR's \"Planet Money\" discussed the acquisition of Sue from a financial and legal perspective.\n\nThe personified dinosaur, through Sue's official Twitter and Field Museum press releases, uses the singular \"they\" pronoun and identifies as non-binary, as the specimen's sex has not been determined. This has led to some calling Sue a non-binary icon.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34019659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34019659", "title": "The Letters of Vincent van Gogh", "text": "The Letters of Vincent van Gogh\n\nVincent's sister-in-law and wife to his brother Theo, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, spent many years after her husband's death in 1891 compiling the letters, which were first published in 1914. Arnold Pomerans, editor of a 1966 selection of the letters, wrote that Theo \"was the kind of man who saved even the smallest scrap of paper\", and it is to this trait that the public owes the 663 letters from Vincent. By contrast Vincent infrequently kept letters sent him and just 84 have survived, of which 39 were from Theo. Nevertheless, it is to these letters between the brothers that is owed much of what is known today about Vincent van Gogh. Indeed, the only period where the public is relatively uninformed is the Parisian period when they shared an apartment and had no need to correspond. The letters effectively play much the same role in shedding light on the art of the period as those between the de Goncourt brothers did for literature.\n\nTheo van Gogh's wife, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, devoted many years to compiling the letters about which she wrote: \"When as Theo's young wife I entered in 1889, our flat in the Cité Pigalle in Paris, I found at the bottom of a small desk a drawer full of letters from Vincent\". Within two years both brothers were dead: Vincent as the result of a gunshot wound, and Theo from illness. Joanna began the task of completing the collection, which was published in full in January 1914. That first edition consisted of three volumes, and was followed in 1952–1954 by a four-volume edition that included additional letters. Jan Hulsker suggested, in 1987, that the letters be organized in date order, and undertaking that began in 1994 when the Van Gogh Letter Project was initiated by the Van Gogh Museum. The project consists of a complete annotated collection of letters written by and to Vincent.\n\nIn the last days of December 1901, running through January 1902, Bruno Cassirer and his cousin Paul Cassirer organized the first van Gogh exhibition in Berlin, Germany. Paul Cassirer first established a market for van Gogh, and then, with the assistance of Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, controlled market prices. In 1906 Bruno Cassirer published a small volume of selected letters of Vincent's to Theo van Gogh, translated into German.\n\nOf the 844 surviving letters that van Gogh wrote, 663 were written to Theo, 9 to Theo and Jo. Of the letters Vincent received from Theo, only 39 survive. The first letter was written when Vincent was 19 and begins, \"My dear Theo\". At that time Vincent was not yet developed as a letter writer – he was factual, but not introspective. When he moved to London, and later to Paris, he began to add more personal information.\n\nBeginning in 1888 and ending a year later, van Gogh wrote 22 letters to Émile Bernard in which the tone is different from those to Theo. In these letters, van Gogh wrote more about his techniques, his use of color, and his theories.\n\nVan Gogh was an avid reader, and his letters reflect his literary pursuits as well as a uniquely authentic literary style. His writing style in the letters reflects the literature he read and valued: Balzac, historians such as Michelet, and naturalists such as Zola, Voltaire and Flaubert. Additionally he read novels written by George Eliot, Charlotte Brontë, Charles Dickens, Keats' poetry, reading mostly at night when the light was too poor for painting. Gauguin told him \"that he read too much\".\n\nVan Gogh scholar Jan Hulsker wrote of van Gogh's letters, \"Vincent was able to express himself splendidly, and it is this remarkable writing talent that has secured the letters their lasting place in world literature\". Poet W. H. Auden wrote about the letters, \"there is scarcely one letter by van Gogh which I ... do not find fascinating\". Pomerans believes the letters to be on the level of \"world literature\" based on style and the ability to express himself. In the letters Vincent reflects different facets of his personality and he adopts a tone specific to his circumstances. At the time he went through a stage of religious fanaticism, his letters fully reflect his thoughts; at the time he was involved with Sien Hoornik his letters reflect his feelings.\n\nVan Gogh's letters paint a chronicle of an artist's life, with the notable omission of the period when he lived in Paris and therefore had no need to correspond with his brother. The letters can be read as an autobiography of an artist; time spent in Brabant, Paris and London, The Hague, Drenthe, Nuenen, Antwerp, Arles, Saint-Remy and Auvers chronicle his corporal travels as well as his artistic growth. Sometimes Vincent wrote Theo every day—beyond the need to acknowledge financial support, describing England and the Netherlands. He included in the letters sketches of common people such as miners and farmers for he believed the poor would inherit the earth. Van Gogh's spiritual and theological thought and convictions are revealed in his letters throughout his life.\n\nFor much of his adult life he was lonely and pushed to learn as much as he could about the world around and about his craft. Margaret Drabble describes the letters from Drenthe as \"heart-breaking\", as he struggled to come to terms with the \"darkness of his hereditary subject matter\", the bleak poverty and meanness of Dutch peasant life. This struggle culminated with his painting \"The Potato Eaters\". His friend and mentor Van Rappard disliked the painting. Undeterred, van Gogh moved south, via Antwerp and Paris. His letters from Arles describe his utopian dream of establishing a community of artists who lived together, worked together, and helped each other. In this project he was joined by Paul Gauguin in late 1888.\n\nLetter 716 is a letter sent jointly by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin to Émile Bernard around 1 November 1888 shortly after Gauguin had joined van Gogh in Arles. Late that summer, van Gogh had completed his second group of \"Sunflower\" paintings, amongst his most iconic paintings, two of which decorated Gauguin's room, as well as his famous painting \"The Yellow House\" depicting the house they shared.\n\nThe letter is unique in being a joint letter from the two, and can be read in both the original French and an English translation at the website of the Van Gogh Museum's edition of the letters. In it they discuss, amongst other matters, their plans to form an artists' commune, possibly abroad. In reality their relationship was always fraught, and by the end of the year they had parted for good, van Gogh himself hospitalised following a breakdown in which he had mutilated one of his ears.\n\nThe autograph fetched €445,000 at a sale in Paris 12–13 December 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

It was called \"the most important collection of rock memorabilia and recordings ever assembled in one business,\" by The Wall Street Journal, Dec 13, 2005.\n\nWolfgang's was started by William E. Sagan, who purchased a warehouse filled with Bill Graham Productions memorabilia in 2003, including taped concert recordings, for about $6 million. These materials had various owners after the death of Bill Graham, the concert promoter, in 1991. The name Wolfgang's is inspired by Bill Graham's original name, Wolodia \"Wolfgang\" Grajonca.\n\nThe company launched its website in November 2003. Later that year, Wolfgang's released the BG Archive photography collection, and subsequently added collections called \"vaults\" for: vintage poster art, rock clothing, vintage audio concert recordings.

The logo is a circle divided into a snowflake and a smiling sun. It is a pun on the name of the company: \"hiver, été liés\" (\"winter, summer together\") sounds a lot like the French pronunciation of \"Yvert et Tellier\". \n\nThe family company was founded by Eugène Yvert in 1831 as a printing works for a legitimist newspaper. The switch to philately was decided 1895 by Eugène's grandson Louis Yvert and his chief printer Théodule Tellier. Nowadays the company is still run by the Yvert family.\n\nYvert et Tellier's major product is a stamp catalog which is a reference for stamps and countries that are most collected by French philatelists: France, Andorra, Monaco, and the former French colonies and their philatelic history as independent states. In France, it is one of the most important philatelic publishing companies, along with Cérès and Dallay. \n\nContinuing the old association between Louis Yvert and Théodore Champion, the \"Ancienne Maison Théodore Champion\" edits monthly and yearly a colour catalog of newly issued stamps from all over the world. Usually, Yvert catalogs for non-European countries were printed in black and white, but in 2008 they started with full color prints.\n\nIt is one of the international references as well, with Michel, Scott and Stanley Gibbons. The Yvert catalogs list stamps issued by all countries in the world, but for non-European countries, the volumes are organized in alphabetic order whereas the German company Michel uses a geographical classification.\n\nDuring the 1890s in Amiens, the Yvert family's printing works is the property of Louis Yvert, grandson of the founder, and his chief printer Théodule Tellier; Tellier kept the company running after the premature death of Louis' father. Louis did not like being in charge of the legimist paper founded by his father, \"L'Écho de la Somme\". He discovered stamp collecting thanks to Tellier, a philatelist, who had already added a small philatelic newspaper, \"L'Écho de la timbrologie\", to the papers printed by the company.\n\nIn 1895, Yvert and Tellier started getting involved in philatelic books. In November 1896 they published a worldwide catalog of stamps and a stamp album. The success was immediate because of their logical and permanent numbering, in contrast to most of their contemporaries, who changed the numbers in their catalogues upon discovering forgotten stamps.\n\nIn 1900, Yvert et Tellier associated with Paris stamp dealer Théodore Champion, who sold unused stamps from all over the world. He fixed the prices of the stamps sold by the company. After Champion's death in 1955, Pierre Yvert and the brothers Ladislas and Alexandre Varga bought Champion's company and the new firm continued to fix Yvert et Tellier's prices.\n\nIn April 1913, Tellier sold his share of the company to Louis Yvert because of the loss of his young grandson. Due to their friendship, Yvert decided that the catalog would continue to be named \"Yvert et Tellier\".\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Yvert prepared his two sons and his son-in-law to run the firm. Henri ran the printing works, his brother Pierre directed \"L'Écho de la timbrologie\", and Jean Gervais took care of the publishing.\n\nPierre Yvert's and Jean Gervais' two grandsons have run the company since the 1990s.\n\nSince 2001 the apparition of the Dallay catalog has had a major effect on the French philatelist public by providing larger pictures of stamps and information not found in the Yvert et Tellier catalogs, such as the name of the artiste and/or engraver, first date of issue, use, etc. Yvert has been fighting on two fronts: it has successfully defended the rights to its numbering system, and it distributes a free CD-ROM with its French stamp catalog.\n\nNevertheless, in March 2005, by urging of the French \"Conseil de la concurrence\", Yvert agreed to sell the use of the Yvert stamp numbers to other publishers.\n\nIn June 2006 Yvert et Tellier published a new catalog of French stamps, a cheaper pocketbook version containing just pictures and prices, as did Cérès, the second main philatelic publishing company in France.\n\nThe Yvert printing company and Yvert et Tellier editor have been ruling mostly by members of the Yvert family. This family tree presents the people who managed these two companies since they were found in the 19th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34398", "title": "Zeus", "text": "Zeus\n\nZeus (; , \"Zeús\" ) is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perkūnas, Perun, Thor, and Odin.\n\nZeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach. In most traditions, he is married to Hera, by whom he is usually said to have fathered Ares, Hebe, and Hephaestus. At the oracle of Dodona, his consort was said to be Dione, by whom the \"Iliad\" states that he fathered Aphrodite. Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many godly and heroic offspring, including Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Minos, and the Muses.\n\nHe was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned the others to their roles: \"Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence.\" He was equated with many foreign weather gods, permitting Pausanias to observe \"That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men\". Zeus' symbols are the thunderbolt, eagle, bull, and oak. In addition to his Indo-European inheritance, the classical \"cloud-gatherer\" (Greek: , \"Nephelēgereta\") also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient Near East, such as the scepter. Zeus is frequently depicted by Greek artists in one of two poses: standing, striding forward with a thunderbolt leveled in his raised right hand, or seated in majesty.\n\nThe god's name in the nominative is (\"Zeús\"). It is inflected as follows: vocative: (\"\"); accusative: (); genitive: (); dative: (). Diogenes Laertius quotes Pherecydes of Syros as spelling the name, .\n\n\"Zeus\" is the Greek continuation of *\",\" the name of the Proto-Indo-European god of the daytime sky, also called *' (\"Sky Father\"). The god is known under this name in the Rigveda (Vedic Sanskrit \"Dyaus/Dyaus Pita\"), Latin (compare \"Jupiter\", from \"Iuppiter\", deriving from the Proto-Indo-European vocative *'), deriving from the root *\"dyeu\"- (\"to shine\", and in its many derivatives, \"sky, heaven, god\").\nZeus is the only deity in the Olympic pantheon whose name has such a transparent Indo-European etymology.\n\nThe earliest attested forms of the name are the Mycenaean Greek , \"di-we\" and , \"di-wo\", written in the Linear B syllabic script.\n\nPlato, in his \"Cratylus\", gives a folk etymology of Zeus meaning \"cause of life always to all things,\" because of puns between alternate titles of Zeus (\"Zen\" and \"Dia\") with the Greek words for life and \"because of.\" This etymology, along with Plato's entire method of deriving etymologies, is not supported by modern scholarship.\n\nCronus sired several children by Rhea: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon, but swallowed them all as soon as they were born, since he had learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overthrown by his son as he had previously overthrown Uranus, his own father, an oracle that Rhea heard and wished to avert.\n\nWhen Zeus was about to be born, Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save him, so that Cronus would get his retribution for his acts against Uranus and his own children. Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Crete, handing Cronus a rock wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he promptly swallowed.\n\nVarying versions of the story exist:\n\n\nAfter reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to disgorge first the stone (which was set down at Pytho under the glens of Parnassus to be a sign to mortal men, the Omphalos) then his siblings in reverse order of swallowing. In some versions, Metis gave Cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus's stomach open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the Hecatonchires and the Cyclopes, from their dungeon in Tartarus, killing their guard, Campe.\n\nAs a token of their appreciation, the Cyclopes gave him thunder and the thunderbolt, or lightning, which had previously been hidden by Gaia. Together, Zeus, his brothers and sisters, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans, in the combat called the Titanomachy. The defeated Titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus. Atlas, one of the titans who fought against Zeus, was punished by having to hold up the sky.\n\nAfter the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, Poseidon and Hades, by drawing lots: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead (the underworld). The ancient Earth, Gaia, could not be claimed; she was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the \"earth-shaker\" (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans who died (see also Penthus).\n\nGaia resented the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of Gaia's other children, the monsters Typhon and Echidna. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under Mount Etna, but left Echidna and her children alive.\n\nZeus was brother and consort of Hera. By Hera, Zeus sired Ares, Hebe and Hephaestus, though some accounts say that Hera produced these offspring alone. Some also include Eileithyia, Eris, Enyo and Angelos as their daughters. In the section of the Iliad known to scholars as the Deception of Zeus, the two of them are described as having begun their sexual relationship without their parents knowing about it. The conquests of Zeus among nymphs and the mythic mortal progenitors of Hellenic dynasties are famous. Olympian mythography even credits him with unions with Leto, Demeter, Metis, Themis, Eurynome and Mnemosyne. Other relationships with immortals included Dione and Maia. Among mortals were Semele, Io, Europa and Leda (for more details, see below) and with the young Ganymede (although he was mortal Zeus granted him eternal youth and immortality).\n\nMany myths render Hera as jealous of his amorous conquests and a consistent enemy of Zeus's mistresses and their children by him. For a time, a nymph named Echo had the job of distracting Hera from his affairs by talking incessantly, and when Hera discovered the deception, she cursed Echo to repeat the words of others.\n\nThe Greeks variously claimed that the Moires/Fates were the daughters of Zeus and the Titaness Themis or of primordial beings like Chaos, Nyx, or Ananke.\n\nThe Charites/Graces were usually considered the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome but they were also said to be daughters of Dionysus and Aphrodite or of Helios and the naiad Aegle.\n\nSome accounts say that Ares, Hebe, and Hephaestus were born parthenogenetically.\n\nAccording to one version, Athena is said to be born parthenogenetically.\n\nHelen was either the daughter of Leda or Nemesis.\n\nTyche is usually considered a daughter of Aphrodite and Hermes.\n\nZeus played a dominant role, presiding over the Greek Olympian pantheon. He fathered many of the heroes and was featured in many of their local cults. Though the Homeric \"cloud collector\" was the god of the sky and thunder like his Near-Eastern counterparts, he was also the supreme cultural artifact; in some senses, he was the embodiment of Greek religious beliefs and the archetypal Greek deity.\n\nAside from local epithets that simply designated the deity as doing something random at some particular place, the epithets or titles applied to Zeus emphasized different aspects of his wide-ranging authority:\n\n\nAdditional names and epithets for Zeus are also:\n\n\nThe major center where all Greeks converged to pay honor to their chief god was Olympia. Their quadrennial festival featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone, but of ash, from the accumulated remains of many centuries' worth of animals sacrificed there.\n\nOutside of the major inter-polis sanctuaries, there were no modes of worshipping Zeus precisely shared across the Greek world. Most of the titles listed below, for instance, could be found at any number of Greek temples from Asia Minor to Sicily. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.\n\nWith one exception, Greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of Zeus as Crete. Minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient Greek religion: \"by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new\", Will Durant observed, and Cretan Zeus retained his youthful Minoan features. The local child of the Great Mother, \"a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort\", whose Minoan name the Greeks Hellenized as Velchanos, was in time assumed as an epithet by Zeus, as transpired at many other sites, and he came to be venerated in Crete as Zeus Velchanos (\"boy-Zeus\"), often simply the \"Kouros\".\n\nIn Crete, Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at Knossos, Ida and Palaikastro. In the Hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Velchanos was founded at the Hagia Triada site of a long-ruined Minoan palace. Broadly contemporary coins from Phaistos show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree, with a cockerel on his knees. On other Cretan coins Velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage. Inscriptions at Gortyn and Lyttos record a \"Velchania\" festival, showing that Velchanios was still widely venerated in Hellenistic Crete.\n\nThe stories of Minos and Epimenides suggest that these caves were once used for incubatory divination by kings and priests. The dramatic setting of Plato's \"Laws\" is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as \"ho megas kouros\", \"the great youth\". Ivory statuettes of the \"Divine Boy\" were unearthed near the Labyrinth at Knossos by Sir Arthur Evans. With the Kouretes, a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan \"paideia\".\n\nThe myth of the death of Cretan Zeus, localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source, Callimachus, together with the assertion of Antoninus Liberalis that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a mythic swarm of bees, suggests that Velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit.\nThe Hellenistic writer Euhemerus apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of Crete and that posthumously, his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhemerus himself have not survived, but Christian patristic writers took up the suggestion.\n\nThe epithet Zeus Lykaios (\"wolf-Zeus\") is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the Lykaia on the slopes of Mount Lykaion (\"Wolf Mountain\"), the tallest peak in rustic Arcadia; Zeus had only a formal connection with the rituals and myths of this primitive rite of passage with an ancient threat of cannibalism and the possibility of a werewolf transformation for the ephebes who were the participants. Near the ancient ash-heap where the sacrifices took place was a forbidden precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast.\n\nAccording to Plato, a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to Zeus Lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal's. Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. There were games associated with the Lykaia, removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of Arcadia, Megalopolis; there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios.\n\nThere is, however, the crucial detail that \"Lykaios\" or \"Lykeios\" (epithets of Zeus and Apollo) may derive from Proto-Greek *, \"light\", a noun still attested in compounds such as , \"twilight\", , \"year\" (lit. \"light's course\") etc. This, Cook argues, brings indeed much new 'light' to the matter as Achaeus, the contemporary tragedian of Sophocles, spoke of Zeus Lykaios as \"starry-eyed\", and this Zeus Lykaios may just be the Arcadian Zeus, son of Aether, described by Cicero. Again under this new signification may be seen Pausanias' descriptions of Lykosoura being 'the first city that ever the sun beheld', and of the altar of Zeus, at the summit of Mount Lykaion, before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and 'facing the sun-rise'. Further Cook sees only the tale of Zeus' sacred precinct at Mount Lykaion allowing no shadows referring to Zeus as 'god of light' (Lykaios).\n\nAlthough etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored a local Zeus who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored Zeus Meilichios (\"kindly\" or \"honeyed\") while other cities had Zeus Chthonios (\"earthy\"), Zeus Katachthonios (\"under-the-earth\") and Zeus Plousios (\"wealth-bringing\"). These deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art, or, for emphasis as both together in one image. They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did chthonic deities like Persephone and Demeter, and also the heroes at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.\n\nIn some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the \"daimon\" to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in Boeotia might belong to the hero Trophonius or to Zeus Trephonius (\"the nurturing\"), depending on whether you believe Pausanias, or Strabo. The hero Amphiaraus was honored as Zeus Amphiaraus at Oropus outside of Thebes, and the Spartans even had a shrine to Zeus Agamemnon. Ancient Molossian kings sacrificed to Zeus Areius.\n\nIn addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men. With the epithet Zeus Aetnaeus he was worshiped on Mount Aetna, where there was a statue of him, and a local festival called the Aetnaea in his honor. Other examples are listed below. As Zeus Aeneius or Zeus Aenesius, he was worshiped in the island of Cephalonia, where he had a temple on Mount Aenos.\n\nAlthough most oracle sites were usually dedicated to Apollo, the heroes, or various goddesses like Themis, a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus. In addition, some foreign oracles, such as Baʿal's at Heliopolis, were associated with Zeus in Greek or Jupiter in Latin.\n\nThe cult of Zeus at Dodona in Epirus, where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium BC onward, centered on a sacred oak. When the \"Odyssey\" was composed (circa 750 BC), divination was done there by barefoot priests called \"Selloi\", who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches. By the time Herodotus wrote about Dodona, female priestesses called peleiades (\"doves\") had replaced the male priests.\n\nZeus's consort at Dodona was not Hera, but the goddess Dione — whose name is a feminine form of \"Zeus\". Her status as a titaness suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.\n\nThe oracle of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before Alexander's day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: Herodotus mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the Persian War. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at Sparta, where a temple to him existed by the time of the Peloponnesian War.\n\nAfter Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa, the figure arose in the Hellenistic imagination of a Libyan Sibyl.\n\nZeus was identified with the Roman god Jupiter and associated in the syncretic classical imagination (see \"interpretatio graeca\") with various other deities, such as the Egyptian Ammon and the Etruscan Tinia. He, along with Dionysus, absorbed the role of the chief Phrygian god Sabazios in the syncretic deity known in Rome as Sabazius. The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes erected a statue of Zeus Olympios in the Judean Temple in Jerusalem. Hellenizing Jews referred to this statue as Baal Shamen (in English, Lord of Heaven).\n\nZeus is occasionally conflated with the Hellenic sun god, Helios, who is sometimes either directly referred to as Zeus' eye, or clearly implied as such. Hesiod, for instance, describes Zeus's eye as effectively the sun. This perception is possibly derived from earlier Proto-Indo-European religion, in which the sun is occasionally envisioned as the eye of *\"Dyḗus Pḥtḗr\" (see Hvare-khshaeta).\n\nThe Cretan Zeus Tallaios had solar elements to his cult. \"Talos\" was the local equivalent of Helios.\n\nIn Neoplatonism, Zeus's relation to the gods familiar from mythology is taught as the Demiurge or Divine Mind. Specifically within Plotinus's work the \"Enneads\" and the \"Platonic Theology\" of Proclus.\n\nZeus is mentioned in the New Testament twice, first in Acts 14:8–13: When the people living in Lystra saw the Apostle Paul heal a lame man, they considered Paul and his partner Barnabas to be gods, identifying Paul with Hermes and Barnabas with Zeus, even trying to offer them sacrifices with the crowd. Two ancient inscriptions discovered in 1909 near Lystra testify to the worship of these two gods in that city. One of the inscriptions refers to the \"priests of Zeus\", and the other mentions \"Hermes Most Great\"\" and \"Zeus the sun-god\".\n\nThe second occurrence is in Acts 28:11: the name of the ship in which the prisoner Paul set sail from the island of Malta bore the figurehead \"Sons of Zeus\" aka Castor and Pollux.\n\nThe deuterocanonical book of 2 Maccabees 6:1, 2 talks of King Antiochus IV (Epiphanes), who in his attempt to stamp out the Jewish religion, directed that the temple at Jerusalem be profaned and rededicated to Zeus (Jupiter Olympius).\n\nThe \"Iliad\" is a poem by Homer about the Trojan war and the battle over the City of Troy. As God of the sky, lightning, thunder, law, order, justice, Zeus controlled ancient Greece and all of the mortals and immortals living there. The Iliad covers the Trojan War, in which Zeus plays a major part.\n\nNotable Scenes that include Zeus\n\nThe most notable conflict in Zeus's history was his struggle for power. Zeus's parents Cronus and Rhea ruled the Ancient World after taking control from Uranus, Cronus's father. When Cronus realized that he wanted power for the rest of time he started to eat his children, Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. When Rhea realized what was going on, she quickly saved their youngest child, Zeus. Having escaped, Zeus was spared because of the swiftness of Rhea tricking Cronus into thinking she consumed Zeus. She wrapped a stone in a blanket, and Cronus swallowed it thinking he was swallowing his last child. As a result of this, Zeus was shipped off to live on the island of Crete.\n\nWhen Zeus was atop Mount Olympus he grew upset with mankind and the sacrifices they were performing on one another. Furiously, he decided it would be smart to wipe out mankind with a gigantic flood using the help of his brother Poseidon, King of the Seas. Killing every human except Deucalion and Pyrrha, Zeus flooded the entire planet but then realized he then had to restore society with new people. After clearing all the water, he had Deucalion and Pyrrah create humans to repopulate the earth using stones that became humans. These stones represented the \"hardness\" of mankind and the man life. This story has been told different ways and in different time periods between Ancient Greek Mythology and The Bible, although the base of the story remains true.\n\nThroughout history Zeus has used violence to get his way, or even terrorize humans. As god of the sky he has the power to hurl lightning bolts as his weapon of choice. Since lightning is quite powerful and sometimes deadly, it is a bold sign when lightning strikes because it is known that Zeus most likely threw the bolt.\n\nDepictions of Zeus as a bull, the form he took when abducting Europa, are found on the Greek 2-euro coin and on the United Kingdom identity card for visa holders. Mary Beard, professor of Classics at Cambridge University, has criticised this for its apparent celebration of rape.\n\n\n"}
