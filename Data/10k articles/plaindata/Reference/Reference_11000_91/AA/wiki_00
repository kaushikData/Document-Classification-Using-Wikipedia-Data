Clause 2 stated \"The terms and conditions of any such renewal renewed lease shall be as agreed upon the parties at the time, but the [renewed] rent shall not be less than the amount payable hereunder\".

The Dakhanavar follows travelers until they stop for a rest, stalking their every move. When they finally stop, the vampire attacks them in their sleep, typically going for their feet. The local legend would often attack travelers in the night, sucking blood from their feet. In one legend, he was outsmarted by two men who had already heard of the vampire's habits and slept with their feet under the other's head. The vampire, thinking that they were one being with two heads and no feet, ran from the valley and was never heard from again.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Maberry’s“Vampire Universe: The Dark World of Supernatural Beings That Haunt Us, Hunt Us and Hunger for Us”:\n\n“The Dakhanavar is ferociously territorial and will assault anyone who tries to make a map of its lands, or even count the hills and valleys in the region, correctly fearing that a thorough knowledge of the landscape would reveal all of its secret hiding places.\nEven today some travelers in Armenia, particularly those going into the region of Mount Ararat, generally take precautions against evil beings such as Dakhanvar. Often, they put small cloves of raw garlic in various pockets or mash it up and rub the paste on their shoes. At night, if camping out of doors, these travelers build a large fire and toss garlic bulbs into the flames. The combination of garlic aroma and a blazing fire will drive almost all of the world’s many species of vampires away.”\n"}

The long cast was displayed from 1979 to 2017 in the Hintze Hall, the central entrance hall of the Natural History Museum, in London.\n\nThe genus \"Diplodocus\" was first described in 1878 by Othniel Charles Marsh. The fossilised skeleton from which Dippy was cast was discovered in Wyoming in 1898, and acquired by the Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie for his newly-founded Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. The bones were soon recognised as a new species, and named \"Diplodocus carnegii\".\n\nKing Edward VII, then a keen trustee of the British Museum, saw a sketch of the bones at Carnegie's Scottish home, Skibo Castle, in 1902, and Carnegie agreed to donate a cast to the Natural History Museum as a gift. Carnegie paid £2,000 for the casting in plaster of paris, copying the original fossil bones held by the Carnegie Museum (not mounted until 1907, as a new museum building was still being constructed to house it).\n\nThe 292 cast pieces of the skeleton were sent to London in 36 crates, and the long exhibit was unveiled on 12 May 1905, to great public and media interest, with speeches from the museum director Professor Ray Lankester, Andrew Carnegie, Lord Avebury on behalf of the trustees, the director of the Carnegie Museum William Jacob Holland, and finally the geologist Sir Archibald Geikie. The cast was mounted in the museum's Reptile Gallery to the left of the main hall (now the gallery of Human Biology) as it was too large to display in the Fossil Reptile Gallery (to the right of the main hall; now the gallery of Creepy Crawlies). \n\nCarnegie paid to have additional casts made for display in many European capitals - including Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Bologna, St Petersburg and Madrid; one sent to Munich was never erected – as well as Mexico City and La Plata in Argentina, making Dippy the most-viewed dinosaur skeleton in the world. The cast in London quickly became an iconic representation of the museum, and has featured in many cartoons and other media, including the 1975 Disney comedy \"One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing\". \n\nDippy was taken to pieces and stored in the museum's basement during the Second World War to protect it from bomb damage, and reinstalled in the Reptile Gallery after the war. The original presentation of the cast was altered several times to reflect changes in scientific opinion on the animal's stance. The head and neck were originally posed in a downwards position, and were later moved to a more horizontal position in the 1960s.\n\nDippy was removed from the Reptile Gallery in 1979 and repositioned as the centrepiece of the main central hall of the museum, later renamed the Hintze Hall in recognition of a large donation by Michael Hintze. Dippy replaced a mounted African elephant, nicknamed George, which had been on display as the central exhibit in the main hall since 1907, with various other animal specimens. The elephant had itself replaced the skeleton of a sperm whale which was the first significant exhibit in the hall and had been on display since at least 1895: earlier, the hall had been left largely empty.\n\nDippy was originally displayed alongside a cast of a \"Triceratops\" skeleton, which was removed around 1993. The tail of the Diplodocus cast was also lifted to waft over the heads of visitors; originally it drooped to trail along the floor.\n\nAfter 112 years on display at the museum, the dinosaur replica was removed in early 2017 to be replaced by the long skeleton of a young blue whale, dubbed \"Hope\". The whale had been stranded on sandbanks at the mouth of Wexford Harbour, Ireland in March 1891. Its skeleton was acquired by the museum and had been displayed in the Large Mammals Hall (originally the New Whale Hall) since 1934.\n\nThe work involved in removing Dippy and replacing it with the whale skeleton was documented in a BBC Television special, \"Horizon: Dippy and the Whale\", narrated by David Attenborough, which was first broadcast on BBC Two on 13 July 2017, the day before the whale skeleton was unveiled for public display.\n\nDippy started a tour of British museums in February 2018, mounted on a new more mobile armature. Over the following three years, Dippy will be exhibited at locations around the UK: Dorset County Museum (10 February - 7 May 2018), Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (26 May - 9 September 2018), Ulster Museum (17 September 2018 - 6 January 2019), Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Great North Museum, the National Assembly for Wales, Number One Riverside in Rochdale, and Norwich Cathedral.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24624524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24624524", "title": "Ecomorphology", "text": "Ecomorphology\n\nEcomorphology or ecological morphology is the study of the relationship between the ecological role of an individual and its morphological adaptations. The term \"morphological\" here is in the anatomical context. Both the morphology and ecology exhibited by an organism are directly or indirectly influenced by their environment, and ecomorphology aims to identify the differences Current research places emphasis on linking morphology and ecological niche by measuring the performance of traits (i.e. sprint speed, bite force, etc.) associated behaviours, and fitness outcomes of the relationships.\n\nCurrent ecomorphological research focuses on a functional approach and application to the science. A broadening of this field welcomes further research in the debate regarding differences between both the ecological and morphological makeup of an organism.\n\nThe roots of ecomorphology date back to the late 19th century. Then, description and comparison of morphological form, primarily for use in avian classification, was focal point of morphological research. However, during the 1930s and 40s morphology as a field shrank. This was likely due to the emergence of new areas of biological inquiry enabled by new techniques. The 1950s brought about not only a change in the approach of morphological studies, resulting in the development of evolutionary morphology in the form of theoretical questions, and a resurgence of interest in the field. High-speed cinematography and x-ray cinematography began to allow for observations of movements of parts while electromyography allowed for observation of the integration of muscle activities. Together, these methodologies allowed morphologists to better delve into the intricacies of their study. It was then, in the 1950s and 60s, that ecologists began to use morphological measures to study evolutionary and ecological questions. This culminated in Karr and James coining the term \"ecomorphology\" in 1975. The following year the links between vertebrate morphology and ecology were finally established creating the foundations of modern ecomorphology.\n\nFunctional morphology differs from ecomorphology in that it deals with the features arising from form at varying levels of organisation. Ecomorphology, on the other hand, refers to those features which can be shown to derive from the ecology surrounding the species. In other words, functional morphology focuses heavily on the relationship between form and function whereas ecomorphology is interested in the form and the influences from which it arises. Functional morphology studies often investigate relationships between the form of Skeletal muscle and physical properties such as force generation and joint mobility. This means that functional morphology experiments may be done under laboratory conditions whereas ecomorphological experiments may not. Moreover, studies of functional morphology themselves provide insufficient data upon which to make conclusions regarding environmental adaptations of a species. The data provided from these studies can, however, support and enrich the understanding of a species' ecomorphological adaptations. For instance, the relationship between the organization of the jaw lever-arm system, mouth size, and jaw muscle force generation and the feeding behaviour of sunfish has been investigated. Work of this variety lends scientific support to seemingly intuitive concepts. For instance, increases in mouth size correspond to an increase in prey size. However, less obvious trends also exist. The prey-size of fish does not seem to correlate so much to body size as to the characteristics of the feeding apparatus.\n\nThe work above is just one example of an ecomorphology based behavioural study. Studies of this variety are becoming increasingly important in the field. Behavioural studies interrelate functional and eco-morphology. Features such as locomotory ability in foraging birds have been shown to affect dietary preferences by studies of this type. Behavioural studies are particularly common in fisheries and in studying birds. Other studies attempt to relate ecomorphological findings with the dietary habits of species. Griffen and Mosblack (2011) investigated differences in diet and consumption rate as a function of gut ecomorphology. Indeed, gut volume was found to correlate positively to increasing metabolic rate. Ecomorphological studies can often be used to determine to presence of parasites in a given temporospatial context as parasite presence can alter host habitat use.\n\nOther current work within ecomorphology focuses on broadening the knowledge base to allow for ecomorphological studies to incorporate a wider range of habitats, taxa, and systems. Much current work also focuses on the integration of ecomorphology with other comparative fields such as phylogenetics and ontogenetics to better understand evolutionary morphology.\n\nAn understanding of ecomorphology is necessary when investigating both the origins of and reasons for biodiversity within a species. Ecomorphology is fundamental for understanding changes in the morphology of a species in which subsets occupy different ecological niches, demonstrate different reproductive techniques, and have various sensory modalities. Studies conducted on species with high biodiversity frequently investigate the extent to which species morphology is influenced by their ecology. Bony fishes are often used to study ecomorphology due to their long evolutionary history, high biodiversity, and multi-stage life cycle. Studies on the morphological diversity of African cichlids conducted by Fryer and Iles were some of the first to demonstrate ecomorphology, . This is largely due to cichlids having great biodiversity, wide distribution, the ability to occupy various ecological niches, and obvious morphological differences. Ecomorphology is also often used to study the paleohabitat of a species and/or its evolutionary morphology.\n\nThe history of how a species has undergone morphological adaptations to better suit its ecological role can be used to draw conclusions about its paleohabitat. The morphologies of paleo-species found at a location help to make inferences about the previous appearance and properties of that habitat. Research using this approach has been widely conducted using bovid fossils due to their large skeletons and extensive species radiation. Plummer and Bishop conducted a study using extant African bovids to investigate the animal’s paleoenvironment based on their habitat preference. The strong correlation found between bovid phylogeny and habitat preference suggests that linking morphology and habitat is taxon dependent. Evidence also suggests that further study of the ecomorphology of previously existing habitats may be useful in determining the phylogenetic risk associated with species living in a specific habitat.\n\nThe study of evolutionary morphology concerns changes in species morphology over time in order to become better suited to their environment. These studies are conducted by comparing the features of species groups to provide a historical narrative of the changes in morphology observed with changes in habitat. A background history of a species features and homology must first be known before a history of evolutionary morphology can be observed. This area of biology serves only to provide a nominal explanation of evolutionary biology, as a more in depth explanation of species history is required to provide a thorough explanation of evolution within a species.\n\nSuggestions have been made that the correlations between species biodiversity and particular environments may not necessarily be due to ecomorphology, but rather a conscious decision made by species to relocate to an ecosystem to which their morphologies are better suited. However, there are currently no studies that provide concrete evidence to support this theory. Studies have been conducted to predict fish habitat preference based on body morphology, but no definitive distinction could be made between correlation and causation of fish habitat preference.\n\nBetz, O.

It is suggested that ECM represents an opposition to a Ukrainian youth organization PORA.\n\nThe early-20th century Eurasianist ideology of a part of the Russian emigration and modern neo-Eurasianism developed by Aleksandr Dugin has been declared the main ideology of the organization. Its ideology also features prominently Russian nationalism and imperialism, calls for the creation of a new Eurasian empire centered on Russia. On its website, the movement declared the West and in particular the United States as its main opponent and termed it as the \"main evil\": \n\nIn its internal policy, the ECM supports the current government of Russia and in particular its President Vladimir Putin. Some also claim that the movement receives taciturn support from the Russian government eager to see a movement opposed to a possibility of an Orange Revolution happening in Russia.\n\nIn Russia, the ECM has allied itself with organizations like the National Bolshevik Front, the Movement Against Illegal Immigration and other groups of that type. It organizes and takes part in the annual Russian marches in Russia and other countries of Eastern Europe. Very often these marches are accompanied by violence, especially in Ukraine.\n\nAfter Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2004, the ECM set up branches in several Ukrainian cities and voiced its sharp criticism of the pro-Western Ukrainian government. The ECM was responsible for a string of attacks on property and organizations they deemed pro-Western. It organised attacks on several Ukrainian Security Service branches, monuments to Ukrainan Insurgent Army veterans and hacker attacks on the website of the President of Ukraine. The most prominent of these attacks that received nationwide attention was the desecration of Ukrainian state symbols on Mount Hoverla in October 2007. The other attack on Ukrainian targets was in Moscow, where several ECM members trashed an exhibition devoted to the Holodomor (1932–1933), a man-made famine that targeted Ukrainians. Due to the relatively high profile of these attacks the Ukrainian police asked for assistance from Russia in finding people responsible for them, but no suspects have been apprehended yet.\nThe organization's vandalism and sharp anti-governmental stance received wide condemnation among Ukrainian media and provoked a response from different Ukrainian organizations of the opposite orientation. Several threats were made against the organization and its members and an arson attack was reciprocated on the ECM's offices in Moscow.\n\nIn 2011, a Ukrainian court banned the ECM and its leaders Dugin and Zarifullin were declared personae non grata.

{"id": "194708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194708", "title": "Gargantua and Pantagruel", "text": "Gargantua and Pantagruel\n\nThe Life of Gargantua and of Pantagruel () is a pentalogy of novels written in the 16th century by François Rabelais, which tells of the adventures of two giants, Gargantua (; ) and his son Pantagruel (; ). The text is written in an amusing, extravagant, and satirical vein, and features much crudity, scatological humor, and violence (lists of explicit or vulgar insults fill several chapters).\n\nThe censors of the Collège de la Sorbonne stigmatized it as obscene, and in a social climate of increasing religious oppression in a lead up to the French Wars of Religion, it was treated with suspicion, and contemporaries avoided mentioning it. According to Rabelais, the philosophy of his giant Pantagruel, \"Pantagruelism\", is rooted in \"a certain gaiety of mind pickled in the scorn of fortuitous things\" (French: \"une certaine gaîté d'esprit confite dans le mépris des choses fortuites\").\n\nRabelais had studied Ancient Greek and he applied it in inventing hundreds of new words in the text, some of which became part of the French language. Wordplay and risqué humor abound in his writing.\n\nAlthough different editions divide the work into a varying number of tomes, the original book is a single novel consisting of five volumes.\n\nThe full modern English title for the work commonly known as Pantagruel is The Horrible and Terrifying Deeds and Words of the Very Renowned Pantagruel King of the Dipsodes, Son of the Great Giant Gargantua and in French, \"Les horribles et épouvantables faits et prouesses du très renommé Pantagruel Roi des Dipsodes, fils du Grand Géant Gargantua\". The original title of the work was \"Pantagruel roy des dipsodes restitué à son naturel avec ses faictz et prouesses espoventables\". Although most modern editions of Rabelais's work place Pantagruel as the second volume of a series, it was actually published first, around 1532 under the pen name \"Alcofribas Nasier\", an anagram of \"François Rabelais\".\n\n\"Pantagruel\" was a sequel to an anonymous book entitled \"The Great Chronicles of the Great and Enormous Giant Gargantua\" (in French, \"Les Grandes Chroniques du Grand et Enorme Géant Gargantua\"). This early \"Gargantua\" text enjoyed great popularity, despite its rather poor construction. Rabelais's giants are not described as being of any fixed height, as in the first two books of \"Gulliver's Travels\", but vary in size from chapter to chapter. For example, in one chapter Pantagruel is able to fit into a courtroom to argue a case, but in another the narrator resides inside Pantagruel's mouth for 6 months and discovers an entire nation living around his teeth.\n\nAt the beginning of this book, Gargantua's wife dies giving birth to Pantagruel, who grows to be as giant and scholarly as his father. Rabelais gives a catalog of his reading, mostly humorously-titled books, and judgements in nonsensical legal cases. \"The lion's share of \"Pantagruel\"s seventh chapter consists of a concluding catalog attributed to the Abbey of Saint-Victor,\" states Bodemer in his essay, \"Rabelais and the Abbey of Saint-Victor Revisited\".\n\nHe befriends hard-partying jokester Panurge. Together with a group of friends, they intoxicate an army of invading giants, burn their camp, and drown survivors in urine. Epistemon, decapitated in the fray, recovers when Panurge sews his head back to his body. He reports that souls in hell are poorly paid and work bad jobs, but that's the extent of their torments. Another battle is missed by the narrator, who is exploring the civilization in Pantagruel's mouth at the time.\n\nAfter the success of \"Pantagruel\", Rabelais revisited and revised his source material. He produced an improved narrative of the life and acts of Pantagruel's father in The Very Horrific Life of Great Gargantua, Father of Pantagruel (in French, \"La vie très horrifique du grand Gargantua, père de Pantagruel\"), commonly known as Gargantua. This volume begins with the miraculous birth of Gargantua after an 11-month pregnancy.\n\nThe labor is so difficult, his mother threatens to castrate his father, Lord Grandgousier. The giant Gargantua emerges at his mother's left ear, calling for ale, while 17,913 cows were required for the provision of his daily milk. His first garment featured a codpiece whose \"exiture, outjecting or outstanding ... was of the length of a yard\", its contents providing so much delight that his three nurses squabble over claims to it. After some indifferent education at home, he is sent to Paris where the crowds so annoy him that he drowns thousands of them in a flood of urine (the survivors laugh so much, the city is renamed \"Par Ris\").\n\nHe steals the bells of St. Anthony, but gives them back after a sophist makes ludicrously self-centered appeals for their return. While he studies diligently in Paris, the neighboring Lord Picrochole's bakers are insulted and attacked by Grandgousier's shepherds. A massive retaliatory strike against Grandgousier's lands is finally halted at Seville by the merciless Friar John. Grandgousier sues for peace, but Picrochole arrogantly rebuffs him. Gargantua and Friar John rally the troops and (after Gargantua nearly swallows 6 pilgrims who accidentally fell in his salad) they win a great battle, drive Picrochole back to his city, then overthrow it. As a reward he gives Le Coudray to Gymnaste, Montpensier to Eudemon, Le Rivau to Tolmere, Montsoreau to Ithybole, and Candes to Acamas.\n\nAlso as a reward, Friar John is given funds to establish the \"anti-church\" Abbey of Thélème, which has become one of the most notable parables in Western philosophy. It can be considered a point-by-point critique of the educational practices of the age, or a call for free schooling, or a defense of all sorts of notions on human nature.\n\nRabelais then returned to the story of Pantagruel himself in the last three books. In The Third Book of Pantagruel (in French, \"Le tiers-livre de Pantagruel\"; the original title is \"Le tiers livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel\"), the narrative style changes to a parody of the philosophical dialogue, where the earthy Panurge gets the last word. He sermonizes against moral restraint and in favor of indebtedness, yet accepts Pantagruel's offer to repay all of his creditors.\n\nNow financially solvent for the first time, Panurge stops wearing his long codpiece and seeks advice about whom to marry. Various auguries (opening Virgil to a random page, inducing prophetic dream through half-hearted fasting) and councillors – the Sibyl of Panzoust, the mute Goatnose, the old poet Raminagrobis, Friar John, a group of learned doctors and lawyers, and a fool – all agree that if he marries, his wife will cheat on him, beat him, and rob him. But he egregiously reinterprets their prophecies in a more favorable light.\n\nIn a brief interlude, Pantagruel defends Judge Brindlegoose, who has pronounced sentence by rolling dice for 40 years, on the grounds that he is an old idiot and therefore favored by Fortune. As a last attempt to settle the question of marriage, Pantagruel and Panurge take a sea voyage to consult the Oracle of Bacbuc (\"Divine Bottle\"). Their ship is well-provisioned with the phallic herb Pantagruelion, for which Rabelais gives a ribald natural history.\n\nThe sea voyage continues for the whole of The Fourth Book of Pantagruel (in French, \"Le quart-livre de Pantagruel\"; the original title is \"Le quart livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel\"). The whole book can be seen as a comical retelling of the Odyssey, or of the story of Jason and the Argonauts. In \"The Fourth Book\", perhaps his most satirical, Rabelais criticizes the arrogance and wealth of the Roman Catholic Church, the political figures of the time, and popular superstitions, and he addresses several religious, political, linguistic, and philosophical issues.\n\nThe group sails to East Asia and buys many exotic animals. Panurge quarrels with the sheep merchant Dingdong, and takes his revenge by drowning him and his flock. They pass by the islands of the Bailiffs, whose peasants charge to be beaten. During a terrible storm at sea, Panurge is paralyzed with fear but feigns insufferable bravura afterwards. After slaying a sea-monster and being informed of the death of the giant Lent, they arrive at Wild Island, where the half-sausage inhabitants (called Chitterlings) mistake Pantagruel for their enemy Lent and attack.\n\nThe battle is stopped by a divine winged pig, who excretes mustard on the battlefield. They proceed to Ruach, whose people eat air, to barren Pope-Figland where a farmer and his wife outwit the devil, and to the arrogantly Catholic Papimania, where the people worship the Pope and his Decretals. After sailing through a cloud of frozen words and sounds, they come to an island that worships Gaster, the god of food. The book ends when Pantagruel fires a salute at the island of the Muses, and Panurge befouls himself for fear of the sound, and of the \"celebrated cat Rodilardus\".\n\nThe Fifth Book of Pantagruel (in French, \"Le cinquième-livre de Pantagruel\"; the original title is \"Le cinquiesme et dernier livre des faicts et dicts héroïques du bon Pantagruel\") was published posthumously around 1564, and chronicles the further journeyings of Pantagruel and his friends. At Ringing Island, the company find birds living in the same hierarchy as the Catholic Church.\n\nOn Tool Island, the people are so fat they slit their skin to allow the fat to puff out. At the next island they are imprisoned by Furred Law-Cats, and escape only by answering a riddle. Nearby, they find an island of lawyers who nourish themselves on protracted court cases. In the Queendom of Whims, they uncomprehendingly watch a living-figure chess match with the miracle-working and prolix Queen Quintessence.\n\nPassing by the abbey of the sexually prolific Semiquavers, and the Elephants and monstrous Hearsay of Satin Island, they come to the realms of darkness. Led by a guide from Lanternland, they go deep below the earth to the oracle of Bacbuc. After much admiring of the architecture and many religious ceremonies, they come to the sacred bottle itself. It utters the one word \"trinc\". After drinking liquid text from a book of interpretation, Panurge concludes wine inspires him to right action, and he forthwith vows to marry as quickly and as often as possible.\n\nThe last volume's attribution to Rabelais is debatable. The Fifth Book was not published until nine years after his death and includes much material that is clearly borrowed (such as from Lucian's \"True History\" and Francesco Colonna's \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\") or of lesser quality than the previous books. In the notes to his translation of \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\", Donald M. Frame proposes that the Fifth Book may have been formed from unfinished material that a publisher later patched together. This interpretation has been largely supported by Mireille Huchon in \"Rabelais Grammairien\", the first book to provide a rigorous grammatical analysis of the matter.\n\nJ. M. Cohen, in his Introduction to the Penguin Classics edition, states that chapters 17–48 were written by another hand using notes left by Rabelais and the general drift of what Rabelais had written of the Fifth Book.\n\nMikhail Bakhtin's book \"Rabelais and His World\" explores Gargantua and Pantagruel and is considered a classic of Renaissance studies. Bakhtin declares that for centuries Rabelais' book had been misunderstood. Throughout \"Rabelais and His World\", Bakhtin attempts two things. First, to recover sections of Gargantua and Pantagruel that in the past were either ignored or suppressed. Secondly, to conduct an analysis of the Renaissance social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language which was not.\n\nThrough this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts in Rabelais' work: the first is carnivalesque which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is grotesque realism, which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in \"Rabelais and His World\", Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.\n\nBakhtin explains that \"carnival\" in Rabelais' work and age is associated with the collectivity, for those attending a carnival do not merely constitute a crowd. Rather the people are seen as a whole, organized in a way that defies socioeconomic and political organization. According to Bakhtin, \"[A]ll were considered equal during carnival. Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age\".\n\nAt carnival time, the unique sense of time and space causes the individual to feel he is a part of the collectivity, at which point he ceases to be himself. It is at this point that, through costume and mask, an individual exchanges bodies and is renewed. At the same time there arises a heightened awareness of one's sensual, material, bodily unity and community.\n\nBakhtin says also that in Rabelais the notion of carnival is connected with that of the grotesque. The collectivity partaking in the carnival is aware of its unity in time as well as its historic immortality associated with its continual death and renewal. According to Bakhtin, the body is in need of a type of clock if it is to be aware of its timelessness. The grotesque is the term used by Bakhtin to describe the emphasis of bodily changes through eating, evacuation, and sex: it is used as a measuring device.\n\nThomas Urquhart first translated the work into English in the mid-17th century, although his translation was incomplete, and Peter Anthony Motteux completed the translation of the fourth and fifth books. The Urquhart/Motteux version is far from literal, but Urquhart's work was described by J. M. Cohen in the preface to his 1955 translation as \"more like a brilliant recasting and expansion than a translation\", although Motteux's contribution was criticised as \"no better than competent hackwork... [W]here Urquhart often enriches, he invariably impoverishes\". The Urquhart/Motteaux translation is out of copyright, and so it has been used for many reprinted editions, including that of Britannica's \"Great Books of the Western World\".\n\nWilliam Francis Smith (1842–1919) made a new translation in 1893, trying to match Rabelais' sentence forms exactly, which renders the English obscure in places. For example, the convent prior exclaims against Friar John when the latter bursts into the chapel,\n\nWhat will this drunken Fellow do here? Let one take me him to prison. Thus to disturb divine Service!\n\nSmith's version includes copious notes. \n\nAlso well annotated is an abridged but vivid translation of 1946 by Samuel Putnam, which appears in a Viking Portable edition that was still in print as late as 1968. Putnam omitted sections he believed of lesser interest to modern readers, including the entirety of the fifth book. The annotations occur every few pages, explain obscure references, and fill the reader in as to original content by him excised. \n\nJohn Michael Cohen's modern translation, first published in 1955 by Penguin, \"admirably preserves the frankness and vitality of the original\", according to its back cover, although it provides limited explanation of Rabelais' word-plays and allusions.\n\nPenguin published a translation by M. A. Screech in 2006 with an explanatory section preceding each chapter and brief footnotes explaining some of the allusions and puns used.\n\nThe most famous and reproduced illustrations for \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\" were done by French artist Gustave Doré and published in 1854. Several appear in this article. Over 400 additional drawings were done by Doré for the 1873 second edition of the book. An edition published in 1904 was illustrated by W. Heath Robinson. Another set of illustrations was done by French artist Joseph Hémard and published in 1922.\n\n\n\n"}

The original campaign ran for twelve 45-second instalments between 1987 and 1993. It starred Anthony Head and Sharon Maughan as Tony and Sharon, a couple who begin a slow-burning romance over a cup of the advertised coffee. The ads were in a serial format, with each ad ending on a cliffhanger. The commercials were extremely popular, and as time went on, the appearance of a new instalment would merit considerable media attention. The ads were developed by McCann Erickson. They are one of the most famous examples of serialized advertising.\n\nBeginning in 1990, new versions of the ads were produced for the American market, where Gold Blend was called \"Taster's Choice,\" and the ads were referred to as the \"Taster's Choice saga\". Head and Maughan reprised their roles, but used American accents in the reshot ads. After the first two nearly identical ads, the American ads diverged into their own storyline.\n\nThe campaign was a remarkable success, producing various tie-in products, including a novelization entitled \"Love Over Gold\" by Susan Moody, a video compilation of the ads, and two music CDs. The ads had a notable effect on sales, increasing them over 50% in the UK alone. They have been heralded as a premier example of positioning, creating an atmosphere of sophistication while remaining relatable. They were frequently compared to a soap opera, even sometimes favorably compared to their contemporaries, such as \"Dynasty\", \"Moonlighting\", or \"thirtysomething\". Famously, Head and Maughan appeared on the cover of \"The Sun\" after their campaign concluded and the two characters confessed their love for each other.\n\nIn later years, there were two additional series of ads starring new couples. The second series starred Louise Hunt and Mark Aiken and focused on a younger, more career-oriented woman, running for six instalments until 1997. In 1998, a new version with Simone Bendix and Neil Roberts began, but the campaign was discontinued after only one ad.\n\nIn 2005, the campaign ranked at number 20 on \"ITV's Best Ever Ads\". It had ranked at number 31 in a similar list compiled in 2000 aired on Channel 4.\n\n\n"}

There are several such dictionaries from different publishers. The most comprehensive one, published by Dankook University Publishing, contains 53,667 Chinese characters and 420,269 compound words. This dictionary was a project of the Dankook University Institute of Oriental Studies, which started in June 1977 and was completed 28 October 2008, and cost 31 billion KRW, or US$25 million. The dictionary comprises 16 volumes (including an index volume) totalling over 20,000 pages.\n\nIn addition to the Han-Han Daesajeon, in 1966, Dankook University completed the \"Dictionary of Korean Chinese Characters.\" Composed of 4 volumes with more than 4,410 pages, this dictionary \"catalogs Chinese characters made and used only by our Korean ancestors (182 characters) as well as examples of Chinese words with Korean usages (84,000 words).\"\n\nWith no Chinese dictionaries with Korean translations, most Korean scholars were resigned to relying on Chinese dictionaries in foreign languages to interpret original Chinese texts. Dr. Choong-sik Chang, the president of Dankook University, brought Lee Hee-seung, the leading authority on Korean literature, to head Dankook's Institute of Oriental Studies. Scholars were invited as advisers in 1977 and as editors to start compilation in 1978. Initially, the university foundation turned down the project after financial difficulties, and concerned senior scholars tried to dissuade Chang from compiling the dictionary. In 2009, Dankook University presented the first complete edition of the Han-Han Daesajeon, or the \"Great Chinese-Korean Dictionary\". 200,000 people worked on the dictionary for 132,800 days, and scholars at Dankook continue to revise and add footnotes to the dictionary.

The first notable effort to compile a comprehensive classical Chinese character dictionary was made by Tetsuji Morohashi (1883–1982), a Japanese scholar. Tetsuji recognized the need and grew determined to compile a Chinese–Japanese Dictionary while studying abroad in China. Despite his manuscripts being burned in a fire during World War II, his publisher going bankrupt, and numerous other setbacks, after 32 years of collaborative work, the \"Dai Kan-Wa Jiten\" or \"Great Chinese–Japanese Dictionary\" was finally completed. Taiwan's Defense Committee followed suit with a 10-year effort, along with the Academia Sinica, to complete the \"Zhongwen Da Cidian\", or \"Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language.\" In 1975, China also made the compilation of a Chinese character dictionary a national project. Collaboration attracted the participation of 43 universities, as well as numerous research centers and scholars nationwide, yielding the 12 volume \"Hanyu Da Cidian\" or \"Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Words\" in 1993.\n\n\n"}

Following widespread comment in the UK and abroad, the \"Independent\" announced a week later that it would make the Happy List an annual fixture. The \"Wall Street Journal\" floated the idea of a Happy List for the United States, but this was not taken up.\n\nThe newspaper accepts that the list is an artificial exercise, but seeks to celebrate people representing much-needed values, in the hope that they will be seen as role models.\n\nThe first list included Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, cricketer and fundraiser Ian Botham, and author and philanthropist J. K. Rowling.\n\nNotably, the first happy list also included the character Tinky Winky from \"Teletubbies\", a popular British children's show.\n\nThe \"WSJ\" noted that the list included wealthy individuals such as Duncan Bannatyne, quoting his opinion that \"Britain’s rich don’t do enough for good causes.\"\n\nIt also included ten less well-known people who had featured in Gordon Brown's 2007 book, co-authored with Community Links, with a somewhat similar aim, \"Britain's Everyday Heroes\".\n\nThe Happy List 2010 was published as a supplement in the \"Independent on Sunday\" on 25 April 2010.

It is located near the geographical center of the island, at the junction of Richmond Road and Arthur Kill Road. Staten Island Historical Society and Historic Richmond Town are two different names for the same organization, reflecting its long history and evolution.\n\nThe original settlement of Richmond Town was known as Cocclestown in the 1690s due to an abundace of oyster shells. The town was later named Richmond Town in the early 18th century when it was formerly a county seat and commercial center, having contained the former courthouse of Richmond County, and is coterminous with the borough of Staten Island. People who lived in Richmond Town were mostly of Dutch, English, or French descent, and the most common jobs were those of blacksmiths, shoemakers, and other craftsman types. British troops were stationed in Richmond Town during the American Revolution.\n\nHistoric Richmond Town consists of more than 30 historic buildings and sites dating from the late 17th to the early 20th centuries. Decker Farm, located about one mile from the center of Historic Richmond Town, features a farm stand and seasonal activities such as pumpkin picking. The site also contains other former commercial and government buildings, as well as farm buildings and homes, some of which were relocated from other parts of Staten Island. \n\nThe creation of the museum site at Historic Richmond Town was the result of efforts by many Staten Islanders, led by local historians and preservationists: Loring McMillen, William T. Davis and local banker David L. Decker. Fueled by the same depression-era passion for historic preservation which resulted in the creation of Colonial Williamsburg, these men wanted to create a testament to Staten Island's rich history in an era of rapid development and urban sprawl.\n\nEstablished in 1958, Historic Richmond Town is a joint project of the Staten Island Historical Society, an independent nonprofit cultural organization, and the City of New York, which owns the land and the buildings and supports part of its operations with public funds from the Department of Cultural Affairs. \n\nThe main campus of Historic Richmond Town occupies of a site with 15 restored buildings, offering the opportunity to experience the lifestyle of a 300-year-old community. The two churches located outside the museum site are St. Andrew's Episcopal and St. Patrick's RC. A third church, the Reformed Dutch Church of Richmond, was demolished. Mount Richmond Cemetery, operated by the Hebrew Free Burial Association, is also adjacent to the site.\n\nThe purpose of this museum village is to make visitors feel as if they are living in the 19th century. Visitors are able to have a first-hand experience of what Historic Richmond Town once was.\n\nVisitors may take a guided tour of various homes and shops that are fully furnished and restored to specific periods of interpretation; other buildings are in the process of being restored and are not yet open to the public. While Historic Richmond Town is no longer a year-round living history museum (as it was briefly in the 1980s), demonstrations of historic trades, crafts, and basic household activities by costumed museum interpreters take place during certain special events throughout the year and on a regular basis by reservation for visiting school groups. Special events that are open to the public include the Richmond County Fair, quilting classes, Tavern Concerts, Pumpkin Picking at Decker Farm (October), English Country Dancing, Old Home Day, Candlelight Tours, Traditional Dinners, and the Summer Apprenticeship Program.\n\nThe Voorlezer's House, dating to c. 1695, is the oldest exhibit as well as the oldest standing elementary school in the United States. Another exhibit to see is the Guyon-Lake-Tysen House, a Dutch Colonial farmhouse dating to c. 1740. The Christopher House, a restoration-in-progress which dates to c. 1720, features the only functioning jambless fireplace in New York City. Among the many structures are outstanding examples of Dutch Colonial and Greek revival architecture, such as The Stephens-Black House, the John Bennett House, The Britton Cottage, the Crocheron House, the Boehm House, the Basket Maker's House and the Treasure House.\n\nHistoric Richmond Town is featured prominently in the documentary \"A Walk Around Staten Island with David Hartman and Barry Lewis\", which profiles the history and culture of Staten Island. It premiered on December 3, 2007, on PBS member station WNET, and can be seen in its entirety on the companion website .\n\nRichmond Town was featured in the third season of the television series Boardwalk Empire. A 1920s diner and gas station were constructed and shot on location. These sets were shown in the shows third season, which aired in fall of 2012 on HBO. \n\nVisitors can reach Richmond Town via public transportation by taking the S74 Arthur Kill Road bus from the St. George Ferry Terminal. The ride from the ferry terminal takes about 37 minutes. The S54 Manor Road bus also provides local service on weekdays.\n\n\n"}

The museum which forms part of the Merseyside Maritime Museum, consists of three main galleries which focus on the lives of people in West Africa, their eventual enslavement, and their continued fight for freedom. Additionally the museum discusses slavery in the modern day as well as topics on racism and discrimination.\n\nOriginally part of the Merseyside Maritime Museum which opened in 1980, the history of the slave trade was originally discussed as part of the city's maritime history shortly before a dedicated Transatlantic Slavery gallery was created in 1994 to better explore Liverpool's historic role in the slave trade. By the early 2000s international interest in the exhibition and a high volume of visitors led to the decision for a museum specially dedicated to the history of slavery to be set up so as to better explain slavery and its legacy.\n\nThe new museum opened on 23 August 2007, the date of the annual International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition marking the beginning of the slave uprising in Santo Domingo. The year 2007 was particularly significant as it was the bicentenary of the United Kingdom's Slave Trade Act of 1807, which abolished the slave trade (though not slavery itself) inside the British Empire. The Merseyside Maritime Museum used to house a Transatlantic Slavery Gallery. Phase 1 of the International Slavery Museum involved relocating current exhibitions to the third floor of the museum and adding new displays, which doubled the space dedicated to the subject. \n\nNew displays incorporate the latest historical research but also cover wider issues of the legacy of transatlantic slavery, and its contemporary relevance. Topics such as freedom and identity, social justice and human rights, underdevelopment in Africa and the Caribbean, racial discrimination and injustice and the transformation of British and other cultures are covered.\n\nThe East Gallery features approximately 400 annotated songs pertaining to the experience of slavery and the music of Africa and the slave-descended African diaspora.\n\nNational Museums Liverpool say the new gallery focuses on the experience of individuals, using the narratives of enslaved and those involved in the trade. They include a shrine to the ancestors of the enslaved as a quiet area for contemplation and reflection.\n\nThe second phase planned is the development of a new visitor-focused resource centre with an events programme of performance, public lectures and debate. The centre will have a research facility for visiting scholars to work and access to National Museums Liverpool's archive collections. A digital archive of material related to the transatlantic slave trade will be available.\n\nTo enable phase two of the project National Museums Liverpool has acquired the former Dock Traffic Office, which adjoins the Maritime Museum. The two buildings are to be linked. The Dock Traffic building was formerly occupied by ITV's Granada Television.\n\nThe museum was awarded £50,000 in March 2018 to buy and restore the painting 'Am Not I A Man and a Brother'. The painting dates from around 1800 and is based upon a design commissioned by the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. The image is considered to be one of the first instances of a logo designed for a political cause, and was used on the pottery of Josiah Wedgwood.\n\nThere is a section about life and culture in West Africa before the transatlantic slave trade, the history of slavery and also displays and special exhibitions about the legacies of slavery and current human rights issues.\n\nSlavery museum (France)\n\nDaniel Brown, \"Songs of Slavery\", \"Index on Censorship\", Volume 36, Number 1, 2007, p. 138–140.\n\n"}

In the version as was recorded by anthropologist and ethnographer Edward L. Shieffelin whose first contact with them took place in the late 1960s. The story begins in a time the Kaluli call \"hena madaliaki\", which translates \"when the land came into form.\" During the time of \"hena madaliaki\" people covered the earth but there was nothing else: no trees or plants, no animals, and no streams. With nothing to use for food or shelter, the people became cold and hungry. Then one man among them (alternative accounts give two) gathered everyone together and delegated different tasks. He directed one group to become trees and they did. He directed another to become sago, yet another to be fish, another banana and so forth until the world was brimming with animals, food, streams, mountains and all other natural features. There were only a few people left and they became the ancestors of present-day human beings.\n\nThe Kaluli describe this story as \"the time when everything \"alə bano ane\"\" which means roughly \"the time when everything divided\". This concept of all world phenomena as a result of a \"splitting\" has many echos in Kaluli thought and cultural practices. In the Kaluli world view, all of existence is made from people who differentiated into different forms. Animals, plants, streams and people are all the same except in the form they have assumed following this great split. Death is another splitting. The Kaluli have no concept of a transcendent, sacred domain that is spiritual or in any fundamental way distinct from the natural, material world; instead death is another event that divides beings through the acquisition of new forms which are unrecognizable to the living.\n\nThe Kaluli are an indigenous people whose first contact with contemporary western civilization began in the 1940s. Following extensive Christian missionary efforts in the region, variants of the traditional creation story have adopted a few Christian elements. Prior to contact, the Kaluli story described creation as a pragmatic solution to problems of cold and hunger, and the efforts were initiated by one or two ordinary and unnamed men rather than any deity or deities. The Kaluli have since tended to identify one or both of them as \"Godeyo\" (God) and \"Yesu\" (Jesus Christ).\n"}

A release may also be made orally in some circumstances. Releases are routinely used by photographers, in film production, by documentary filmmakers, or by radio and music producers when they photograph, film, video or record the voice or performance of individuals to be sure that the person consents or will not later object to the material being used for whatever purpose the release (or anyone they may assign the release rights to) wishes, i.e. that the release wishes to use the images, sounds or any other rendering that is a result of the recording made of the releasor (or property owned by the releasor for which the releasor may claim some other right such as industrial design rights, trademark or trade dress rights). This will help in insuring the copyright owner has a clean chain of title for any work if it is later published, broadcast, shown in a public cinema or otherwise made public.\n\nReleases are very often used to ensure that litigation is terminated when a settlement or compromise between the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) is reached. A general release may release any claims known or unknown that the releasor may have against the releasee. The release may also be very specific, i.e. dealing with specific acts between the parties and not applying to any other acts.\n\nGenerally a release is of the form: \n\nHowever, most releases are much more detailed in the recitation of what is being released and the extent of the release (where it is valid, when it become valid if there are conditions on its validity, the amount of consideration if it is substantial) and they are either copied and modified as necessary from various form books or drafting manuals used by lawyers or are preprinted forms that are purchased from legal form publishers.\n\nReleases should be drafted by a lawyer, solicitor or civil law notary (not in the United States), except perhaps in the most routine of situations; if the release is not correctly drafted or does not recite any necessary limitations the releasee may find out later that the release did not cover all circumstances, and the releasor may find that the release was too general and released some claim, right or entitlement that the releasor should have retained.\n\n\n"}

Although several other revenue streams also generate revenue (such as theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising) theatrical box office earnings take prominence, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. The success at the box office is measured in a number of ways, and these look at both the total gross as well as the speed with which that gross is attained. This list focuses on the latter. Included on this list are charts showing the films that reached certain milestones in the fastest time. All charts are ranked first by the number of days they took to reach the milestone, and second by their total gross on the day they exceeded the milestone. The charts are not adjusted for inflation, which does erode the achievements of earlier films.\n\nBy 1980, \"Star Wars\" became the first movie to reach a $500 million worldwide gross (not adjusting for inflation). Since then, close to 200 films have grossed over $500 million worldwide. The list below is restricted to the 10 movies that passed the threshold the fastest, not taking into account early, single-show premieres.\n\"Titanic\" became, on March 1, 1998, the first movie to gross over $1 billion worldwide, in just days of release.

{"id": "14897255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14897255", "title": "Lists of Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year", "text": "Lists of Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year\n\nThe lists of Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year (for each year) are ten-word lists published annually by the American dictionary-publishing company Merriam-Webster, Inc., which feature the ten words of the year from the English language. These word lists started in 2003 and have been published at the end of each year. At first, Merriam-Webster determined its contents by analyzing page hits and popular searches on its website. Since 2006, the list has been determined by an online poll and by suggestions from visitors to the website.\n\nThe Words of the Year usually reflect events that happened during the years the lists were published. For example, the Word of the Year for 2005, 'integrity', showed that the general public had an immense interest in defining this word amid ethics scandals in the United States government, corporations, and sports. The Word of the Year for 2004, 'blog', was looked up on the Online Dictionary the most as blogs began to influence mainstream media. In 2006, Merriam-Webster received a lot of publicity as 'truthiness', a word coined by Stephen Colbert on \"The Colbert Report\", topped the list.\n\nWhen the Word of the Year was started in 2003, Merriam-Webster determined which words would appear on the list by analyzing page hits and popular searches to its website. For example, the 2003 and 2004 lists were determined by online hits to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary and Online Thesaurus and to Merriam-WebsterCollegiate.com. In 2006 and 2007, Merriam-Webster changed this practice, and the list was determined by an online poll among words that were suggested by visitors to the site. Visitors were requested to vote for one entry out of a list of twenty words and phrases. The list consisted of the words and phrases that were frequently looked-up on the site and those that were submitted by many readers. From 2008 onwards, however, user submissions have not been a deciding factor, and the list has been composed only of the words which were looked up most frequently that year. Merriam-Webster said that the reason for the change was that otherwise ordinary words were receiving so many hits that their significance could not be ignored.\n\nJohn Morse, president of Merriam-Webster, pointed out that \"the most frequently looked up words are not the newest words, not the latest high-tech terms, not the cool new slang.\" Instead, these top ten words correlated to breaking news stories and world events in 2003. The top word \"democracy\" correlated to the invasion of Iraq and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, \"quarantine\" to a SARS epidemic, and \"matrix\" to the film \"The Matrix Revolutions\".\n\nIn 2004, blogs were becoming highly popular and began to influence mainstream media. During the twelve-month period that decides the word of the year, the term \"blog\" had the most requests for a definition or explanation, so a new entry was placed in Merriam-Webster's printed dictionary for 2005. The other words on this list, such as \"incumbent\", \"electoral\", and \"partisan\", were associated with major news events, such as the United States presidential election of 2004 or natural disasters that hit the US.\n\nFor 2005, \"integrity\" was the most looked-up word in Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. According to John Morse, President of Merriam-Webster, the word \"integrity\" slowly moved up the list to first place in 2005 because ethics scandals emerged around the United States regarding corporations, government, and sports, such as the CIA leak investigations, scandals in Congress, and disgraced athletes.\n\nHurricane Katrina, the bird flu, and the death of Pope John Paul II renewed public interest in words such as \"refugee,\" \"tsunami,\" \"pandemic,\" \"conclave,\" and \"levee.\" The word \"refugee\" was also a candidate for the American Dialect Society's Word of the Year; according to Morse, the term gained notoriety as the entire country debated with how to describe people affected by Hurricane Katrina. The debate, over whether \"refugee\" was the proper term to describe displaced residents or whether the term was pejorative, summoned several Americans to look up the word in their dictionaries to form their own opinion. The word \"refugee\" received more queries in one month than most words in an entire year. The word \"insipid\" made the Top 10 list after Simon Cowell described Anthony Fedorov's performance in \"American Idol\" as \"pleasant, safe, and a little insipid.\" At number 10 is \"inept\", a word that received a lot of attention after the days when President George W. Bush delivered a live prime time news conference that came to an awkward end when some television networks cut him off to return to their regularly scheduled programs.\n\nAfter online visitors chose \"truthiness\" in a five-to-one majority vote as the Word of the Year of 2006, Merriam-Webster received a large amount of publicity. This was the first year in which Merriam-Webster used online voting to decide its Word of the Year. The term was created by Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central in \"The Colbert Report\"'s first episode, which took place on October 2005, to describe things that he fervently believes to be the case regardless of the facts. In addition, \"truthiness\" became the American Dialect Society's Word of the Year for 2005.\n\nJohn Morse, President of Merriam-Webster, said that the word \"w00t\" was a good choice because it \"blends whimsy and new technology\". Spelled with two zeros in leetspeak, \"w00t\" reflects a new direction in the English language led by a generation raised on video games and cell phone text messaging. While the word itself has not been published in its printed dictionary yet, Merriam-Webster claims that its presence in the Open Dictionary and the honors it's been awarded gives \"w00t\" a better chance at becoming an official word. It originally became popular in online gaming forums and is now used as an expression of excitement and joy. The word is also considered an acronym in the online gaming world for the phrase \"We owned the other team.\" This word was also used in the 1990 film Pretty Woman when Julia Roberts exclaimed \"Woot, woot, woot!\" to her date's friends during a polo match.\n\nPlacing second in 2007's contest, \"facebook\" created an unofficial verb out of the website Facebook. Founded in 2004, Facebook is a social network that allows its users to create a profile page and forge links with other friends and acquaintances.\n\n\"Austerity\" was the most searched-for word of 2010. Interest in the word reached its highest point around May 1, the day the Greek government announced a series of austerity measures, but its popularity remained strong throughout the year. Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster editor-at-large, said: \"\"Austerity\" clearly resonates with many people. We often hear it used in the context of government measures, but we also apply it to our own personal finances and what is sometimes called the new normal.\" Barack Obama used the word \"shellacking\" in November 2010, when acknowledging his party's losses in the US mid-term elections, and lookups of \"ebullient\" peaked in October, as thirty-three Chilean miners were successfully rescued after 69 days trapped underground.\n\nThe word \"pragmatic\" was looked up on Merriam-Webster's website an unprecedented number of times in 2011. Although the popularity of the word wasn't linked to any specific event, it received the greatest amount of interest in the latter half of the year, as the United States Congress introduced the Budget Control Act, and its Supercommittee began to craft deficit-reduction plans. \"Ambivalence\" was also a popular word throughout the year; John Moore, President of Merriam-Webster, remarked: \"We think it reflects the public attitude toward a wide range of issues, including the economy, the ongoing debates in Washington, the presidential election, and most recently the race for the Republican Party nomination.\" The term \"vitriol\" was used frequently in the wake of the January 2011 Tucson shooting, which led to a national debate about political rhetoric.\n\nIn November 2011, political commentator David Gergen rounded off a CNN article (entitled \"Have they gone nuts in Washington?\") with the phrase \"après moi, le déluge\". The expression, attributed to Louis XV, typifies the attitude of those who don't care about the future, because they won't be around to face the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe popularity of many of the words on Merriam-Webster's 2012 list were influenced by the commentary and debate that surrounded that year's US presidential election. \"Socialism\" and \"capitalism\" were frequently referred to during the party conventions and the televised debates; interest in \"socialism\" spiked on the day of the election – November 6, 2012. The word \"malarkey\" was used several times by Joe Biden during his vice-presidential debate with Paul Ryan on October 11, and \"meme\" captured the public imagination after a remark made by Mitt Romney about \"binders full of women\", on October 16, went viral.\n\n\"Touché\" remained a popular word throughout the year. This was partly as a result of a new technology of the same name being announced by Disney Research; however, John Morse, President of Merriam-Webster, suggested that \"touché\" was \"simply a word enjoying a period of increased popular use, perhaps as a byproduct of the growing amount of verbal jousting in our culture, especially through social media\".\n\nThe popularity of the word science in 2013 was driven by debates around climate change and science in education. Further debates around pseudoscience and whether science can answer all of life's questions further drove its popularity.\n\nCognitive's popularity was principally driven by ongoing issues with relation to concussion in American professional sports. The popularity of rapport and communication was principally driven by Edward Snowden's revelations around the NSA's global surveillance.\n\nThe suffix \"-ism\" goes all the way back to Ancient Greek, and was used in Latin and medieval French on its way to English. Originally, it turned a verb into a noun: think of \"baptize\" and \"baptism, criticize\" and \"criticism,\" or \"plagiarize\" and \"plagiarism.\" It has since acquired many other uses, including identifying a religion or practice (\"Calvinism, vegetarianism\"), a prejudice based on a specific quality (\"sexism, ageism\"), an adherence to a system (\"stoicism, altruism\"), a condition based on excess of something (\"alcoholism\"), or a characteristic feature or trait (\"colloquialism\").\n\n"}
{"id": "1302810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1302810", "title": "Monte Vettore", "text": "Monte Vettore\n\nMonte Vettore (from latin \"Vector\", \"winner\") is a mountain of the Apennines. It is the highest peak of the Cyblings massif.\n\nThe southwestern side of Cyblings massif, Vector, is included in Sibillini Mountains National Park. Below the summit of Vector lies a small glacial lake in a small enclosed valley between Redeemer Peak.\n\nThe local medieval tradition was that the Apennine Sibyl, a mysterious prophetess not counted among the Sibyls of Classical Antiquity, was condemned by God to dwell in a mountain cavern and await Judgement Day, having rebelled at the news that she had \"not\" been chosen Mother of God, but that some humble Judaean virgin had been favored. The peak of Monte Vettore, surrounded by reddish cliffs was recognized as the crown of \"Regina Sibilla.\"\n\nLess stringently Christian legend set her in an underworld paradise entered through a grotto in the mountains of Norcia. Nearby the magical lake is fed by water from the cavern. Whoever stayed longer than a year could no longer leave, but remained deathless and ageless, feasting in abundance, amid revelry and voluptuous delights. \n\nIn \"Il Guerrin Meschino\", written by Andrea da Barberino about 1410, the central episode of the sixth part (Canto V) contains the \"prodigious adventures\" of Guerrino with this enchantress, the \"Fata\" Alcina, whom he seeks out, against all advice. He locates her cavern in the mountains of central Italy with the aid of Macco, a speaking serpent. She shows him the delights and horrors of her cavern, where sinners have been changed to the appropriate animals, but where sin is the only path to the knowledge of his real parents that he seeks, and Guerrin has to flee.\n\nThe long informative captions in the maps of Ortelius' 16th-century atlas, \"Cartographia Neerlandica\", offer some detail about this Apennine Sybil:\nLocally the Sibilla was in some sense a beneficent \"fata\" whose retinue would descend from her mountain at times to teach the village girls all the secrets of spinning and weaving (see Weaving (mythology) for other European weaving goddesses), and perhaps to dance the saltarello with the best of the young men. But if they were not back in their mountain fastness by sunrise, they would be denied access and would become mere mortals. On one occasion, what with dancing and pleasure, the \"faterelle\" had not noticed the approach of dawn. Scrambling up the Vettore, their goatlike feet crushed the rock to fragments. They reached the safety of their grotto just before dawn, but the long slope of talus is still pointed out as the \"Path of the Fata\".\n\n"}

With 4,251 works exhibited by the painter, the museum has one of the most complete permanent collections of works. The museum is housed in five adjoining medieval palaces in Barcelona's La Ribera and is located on Montcada Street in the (Bank District) of Barcelona. It opened to the public on 9 March 1963, becoming the first museum dedicated to Picasso's work and the only one created during the artist's life. It has since been declared a museum of national interest by the Government of Catalonia.\n\nHighlights of the collection include two of his first major works, \"The First Communion\" (1896), and \"Science and Charity\" (1897). In particular, the Museu Picasso reveals Picasso's relationship with the city of Barcelona, a relationship that was shaped in his youth and adolescence and continued until his death.\n\nThe original idea for the museum came from Picasso’s lifelong friend and secretary, Jaume Sabartés, whom Picasso had given many paintings, drawings, and prints since meeting in 1899. Originally, Sabartés intended to found the museum in Málaga, Picasso’s birthplace. It was Picasso himself who suggested that Barcelona would be more appropriate, given his long standing connections with the city.\n\nOn 27 July 1960, Sabartés signed an agreement with the city of Barcelona to found the museum. The museum opened in 1963, with the collection established through Sabartés' donation of 574 works from his personal collection. Other items included works that Picasso had given to the city of Barcelona, such as \"Harlequin\", works previously in the possession of the city’s museum of modern art, and other gifts from Picasso’s friends and collectors.\nThe museum opened under the name of the Sabartés Collection, because of Picasso’s strong opposition to Franco’s regime. In the end, Barcelona mayor Josep Porcioles went against the wishes of the central government in order to open the museum. When it opened, the museum was located in Palau Aguilar on Montcada Street. In this era, the collection consisted mainly of the personal collection Sabartés, some lithographs, and posters. Other donations during the museum's first year included a book of engravings made by Picasso of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", donated by Salvador Dalí, as well as a collage given by Gala Dalí, titled \"No,\" 1913. In subsequent years, the collection was expanded with donations, including 7-drawings dated between 1899 and 1904 given by Junyer Sebastian Vidal.\n\nAfter Sabartés death in 1968, in 1970 Picasso made his last personal donation to the museum. The donation was made up of 920 varied works, including items from his early work that his family had been keeping for him ever since the time he first settled in France. These included school books, academic pieces and paintings from Picasso's Blue Period. Sabartés himself bequested a number of works upon his death, including a series of 58 paintings on \"Las Meninas\". In December 1970, the museum underwent its first expansion, adding the Palau del Baró de Castellet, which is attached to the original museum building, Palau Aguilar.\n\nAs years passed, the museum grew in importance as more substantial donations were made. During the early 1980s the collection was expanded with several donations from individuals and various art galleries, as well as through acquisitions. In 1982, Picasso's widow Jacqueline Roque gave 41 pieces to the museum. (In 1983), the Louise Leiris Gallery made a donation of 117 engravings. Some notable donations include those from Carles Domingo and the Editorial Gustavo Gili, among others. In 1985, the museum's physical space expanded again with the addition of Palau Mecca.\n\nDuring the 1990s donations included (women \"bust\" or \"Man sitting\"). The museum also acquired works such as \"Portrait of Jacqueline with tape,\" among others. In the late 1990s the museum expanded yet again with the acquisition of Casa Mauri and Palau Windows, both on the same street and adjacent to the museum. Opened in 1999, this new extension added 3,400 square meters to the museum, serving as a space for temporary exhibitions, an auditorium, and additional services. The extension was opened with the temporary exhibition \"Picasso: Interior and Exterior Landscape\", with more than 200 works by the artist created between 1917 and 1970.\n\nIn 2003, the museum's interior was remodeled and the artworks rearranged. Two years later, The Government of Catalonia declared the institution a museum of national interest.\n\nIn 2006, Maite Ocaña, the museum's director since 1983, resigned in order to direct the National Art Museum of Catalonia. Pepe Serra was appointed director of the Picasso in the same year. In 2008, the Museu Picasso rearranged the permanent collection and opened new rooms dedicated to engraving, including one dedicated to Sabartés. Serra has since established a network of organizations associated with Picasso, including the City of Gósol, the Centre Picasso of Horta de Sant Joan and Palau Foundation in Caldes d'Estrac, with the central aim of promoting the position of the artist by the Catalan territory. In 2009, the museum was listed as one of the 40 most visited art museums in the world by \"The Art Newspaper\".\n\nIn 2010 the museum began a project to improve its active presence in social networks such as Twitter, Flickr, and Facebook. The museum's efforts resulted in the Museums & the Web 2010 Best of the Web award for social media. The museum's social media projects promote participatory discussion around the institution's research and knowledge.\n\nMore recently, the museum has built a new building in Sabartés square, behind Montcada Street. This expansion helped alleviate the overcrowding at the entry of the museum. The building was designed by the architect Jordi Garcés, who had completed the previous expansion of the museum.\n\nThe Museu Picasso occupies five large houses or palaces of the Carrer de Montcada Barcelona, dating from the 13th century and 14th century, occupying a total area of 10,628 sqm. The buildings follow the style of Gothic civil Catalan. Each of the 5 buildings are built following a similar pattern, around a courtyard equipped with an exterior staircase that allows access to the main floors. The buildings that house the collection of Picasso's works also have their own history.\n\nThe Palau Aguilar (Montcada, 15) was the first building occupied by the museum. The building was probably built on the residence of James Ses sources, an important character in the life of Barcelona. The building dates from the 13th century but underwent significant alterations between the 15th and 18th centuries. Between the 13th and 14th centuries the building belonged to various nobles of the Court of Aragon. It was purchased in 1386 by the bourgeois family Corominas-Desplà, who then sold it fourteen years later to Berenguer Aguilar, from which the palace is named. Later owners included several members of the Catalan bourgeoisie prior to the building's purchase by the City Council on 3 November 1953.\n\nDuring a restoration made in 1960, the remains of a 13th-century painting were discovered while removing plaster from one of the rooms. Today this work is exhibited in the National Art Museum of Catalonia. A large fresco representing the conquest of Majorca in 1229, the work is made up of cauldrons and roses, which suggest that the palace belonged to the lineage Caldes and Desvalls. It depicts the central courtyard of the building during the 15th century, with an open staircase and a pointed Gotchic arch.\n\nThe Palau Baró de Castellet (Montcada, 17) is a palace from the medieval period. Built during the 13th century, it was owned by the Gerona family during the 15th century. Since then it has changed hands between the bourgeois and aristocratic families of Barcelona, having been remodeled during the 18th century. In 1797, the then owner (Mariano Alegre Aparici Amat) received the noble title of Baron \"Castle\" at the hands of King Charles IV, prompting the palace to receive its name. Upon the death of the Baron, the building was bequeathed to the Hospital of the Holy Cross, who rented it to different tenants until they sold it to the Rivers family. The City Council then purchased the building in the 1950s. The palace was built around a central courtyard and includes on its facade a relief from the 16th century that depicts religious themes. The interior's main floor is in the neo-classical style of the mid-18th century, including elements of marble and polychrome reliefs.\n\nThe Palau Meca (Montcada, 19) was built between the 13th and 14th centuries and also underwent restoration during the 18th century. Similar to the other palaces, it contains a central courtyard. Highlights include the medieval polychrome coffered ceilings of the main floor as well as unique ceilings from the 19th century. In 1349, the property was owned by James Knight, then Minister of the City Council. Under the ownership of his grandson, Ramon Desplà Knight, it became the largest palace on the block. The building later became the property of the family of Cassador (or Hunter), Marquis of Ciutadilla. The first owner, Joseph Mecca Hunter gave the palace its current name. The next family to own it, the Milans, restored the building after it was badly damaged during the War of Spanish Succession. In 1901, the building was given to the Brothers of Christian Doctrine and (was installed Montepío of Santa Madrona.) Over time the Montepío integrated with a bank, who gave the building to the City Council on 5 December 1977. The Palace was reopened as part of the museum on 11 January 1982.\n\nCasa Mauri (Montcada, 21) includes some structures that date from Roman times, when the space was occupied by the suburbs of Barcino. Of note is the unique wood facade, one of the few examples in Barcelona of the locking system typical of the 18th century. Between 1378 and 1516 the building was owned by the Rocha family and in 1716 it was owned by F. Casamada. During the 19th century several renovations were made. Under the owner Josep Vidal Torrents, the building was made to have industrial uses until it was bought by Mauri bakeries in 1943, the company that gave the building its name. In 1999 the building was acquired by Museu Picasso.\n\nThe Palau Finestres (Montcada, 23) was built on the foundations of a building dating to the 13th century and occupies a former Roman necropolis. Between 1363 and 1516 the area belonged to the Marimon family. In 1872, the owner of Casa Mauri, Jose Vidal Torres, bought the building in order to annex it to his home. The City acquired the building in 1970. There are arcades on the ground floor, added during the reforms of the fifteenth and 17th centuries. On the main floor, a coffered ceiling from the end of the 13th century have been restored. The building is currently used as exhibition space.\n\nThe Knowledge and Research Center was opened on 17 February, a new building located in Plaza Sabartés that was designed by architect Jordi Garcés. The site aims to become an international landmark in the study of Picasso and his artistic and social context. Director Pepe Sierra explained that the space would be used for discussion, dialogue, and debate, rather than as a place of consumption. (The organization responsible for this is Silvia Domenech, commissioned between 1997 and 2007 of the Photographic Archive of Barcelona.)\n\nJordi Garcés, who already performed the previous expansion of the museum, designed the 1500 square meter building with a transparent glass facade protected by a cantilever. The building houses an educational center on the ground floor, with 4 multi-purpose spaces aimed at providing educational service for the museum. The first floor is devoted to the library, documentation center, and archives of the museum. The basement is devoted to visitor services. The construction began on 10 July 2009 and ended on 16 February 2011, costing 6.7 million.\n\nThe permanent collection is organized into three sections: painting and drawing, engraving, and ceramics. These cover principally the early years of Picasso’s artistic life, such as his Blue Period from 1901 to 1904, but Picasso, his family, and his friends would bequest or loan other later pieces as well. There are now more than 3,500 works making up the permanent collection of the museum.\n\nThe collection is organized into areas that include the early years (Málaga, Corunna and Barcelona, 1890–97), the training period (Barcelona, Horta de San Juan and Madrid, 1897–1901), the Blue Period (1901–04), works in Barcelona from 1917, and the entire \"Las Meninas\" (1957) series. Most of the paintings on display at the museum are from the period between 1890 and 1917, an important collection in regard to that portion of Picasso's life. The museum has very few paintings after 1917, with the exception of the \"Las Meninas\", painted in 1957. The collection of lithographs comprises the years 1962 and 1982. Picasso himself gave the museum a copy of each of his works produced after the death of Sabartés in 1968. The collection also includes illustrations made by the artist for various books, as well as ceramics gifted to the museum by Picasso's widow, Jacqueline.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2010 the museum began making information on the permanent collection public on their website. As of October 2010, over 65% of the museum's collection was available to view online.\n\nThe Picasso Museum has carried out dozens of exhibitions since it opened. Often, these exposures are related to the figure of the painter or topics related to their environment, trying to research and review the work and studies of the painter from Málaga. We have also held exhibitions on the relationship between Picasso and other artists as Picasso vs. Rusiñol held in 2010. Sometimes also organized a traveling exhibition, and Bullfighting. Paintings, drawings and prints in the collection of the Museu Picasso which could be seen at the Casa Lis in Salamanca in 2010. Also made small exhibition focused on one topic, called displays, such as analyzing the painting Science and Charity, the results of studies showing radiographic and reflectologia or another that analyzes a statement that was made about Picasso in Barcelona 1936, Room Esteva. Picasso Exhibition, 1936.\n\nThe Museu Picasso frequently hosts special exhibitions presenting artworks by Picasso and other artists. From time to time, the museum also organizes seminars and lectures on subjects related to Picasso or on museological issues of interest given by specialists from throughout the world.\n\nThe museum has a free public library of over 6,000 references, located on the third floor of the Palau Aguilar. It is a space for consultation with a documentary on the life and work of the artist and his artistic context, covering virtually every pictorial movements of the 20th century . To access it needed to make an appointment in advance.\nThe library can be found from catalogs of exhibitions of Picasso to bibliophile editions. There are also collections of some of the journals of the avant-garde Catalan of the early 20th century, where Picasso collaborated and appeared often. Also available with restricted access, a collection of artist's books with illustrations by Picasso himself or by other renowned artists.\n\nOne of the other aspects of the Picasso Museum is to highlight the number of services and training proposals and entertainment for families and schools. The museum has a specific department and a section on the website where you can download specific resources to carry out educational activities during the visit, aimed at both primary school teachers as secondary or high school. [24] organizes guided tours for both adults, such as dynamic visits adapted to the different educational levels, both in the permanent collection and temporary exhibitions. The museum also organizes conferences and seminars and activities in collaboration with other institutions such as the UOC, the Grec Festival, the San Juan de Dios Hospital, the Pompeu Fabra University and the School Tool, among others.\n\nThe museum has its own team of preventive conservation and restoration, to ensure that the works of our own collection are in the best possible conditions for future generations. From this department studied and documented both the work and materials that Picasso used in order to improve understanding of his work.\nIn this department also establishes the most appropriate measures of environmental protection and establishing the most appropriate security protocols.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion, and was recognized as the first NWA World Heavyweight Champion in 1948. Brown's professional wrestling career ended on November 1, 1949, when he suffered severe injuries in an automobile accident.\n\nBrown was born on March 10, 1908. He grew up on a small farm in Sharon, Kansas. Brown worked on the farm during the mornings before walking several miles to school in Kiowa, Kansas. He only attended one year of school due to financial reasons.\n\nBrown was noticed by Ernest Brown, a former manager of amateur and professional wrestlers, in the late 1920s, who was convinced that he might have a future as a wrestler and agreed to work with Brown at the local high school in Kiowa, Kansas. After training, Brown was undefeated for 71 matches. He gained enough notoriety in western Kansas that the promoter in Wichita put him on the preliminary of the weekly matches there.\n\nA well-known wrestler named Abe Coleman saw Brown wrestle and recommended him to the promoter in St. Louis, Tom Packs.\nBrown impressed many people with his wrestling skills in matches against former world heavyweight champions Jim Londos and Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis. He quickly won the Kansas Heavyweight Championship. Brown went on to become the Kansas-based Midwest Wrestling Association (MWA) World Heavyweight Champion for a record of 11 times from 1940 to 1948. Brown won the title by beating wrestlers such as Bobby Bruns, Lee Wyckoff, Tom Zaharias, Swedish Angel, Roy Graham and Tug Carlson.\nIn 1948, promoter Pinkie George, along with other promoters, recognized Brown as the World Heavyweight Champion in the newly formed National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). Brown began the NWA's project of unifying the various world heavyweight championships contested at that time with the NWA version. A significant unification match took place against Frank Sexton on March 15, 1949. Sexton held the American Wrestling Alliance Heavyweight Championship, the second most important championship in the country at that time, which he had previously unified with the Maryland version of the World Heavyweight Championship.\nBrown held the World Heavyweight Championship until he was forced to retire in November 1949 due to injuries he suffered on November 1, 1949 in a car accident. He was scheduled to participate in a unification match against Lou Thesz on November 25, 1949. Thesz was awarded the title as Brown was unable to compete.\nAfter retiring, Brown became a promoter in Kansas City, Missouri. He promoted the Midwest Wrestling Association (MWA) from the founding of the NWA in 1948 until 1958, when the promotion was taken over by Bob Geigel.\n\nBrown married Grace Charlotte on October 13, 1927. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1981. Their son Richard also became a wrestler.\n\n\n"}

For contemporary poets he enlisted the help of friends and colleagues. Before he died he managed to collect 346 portraits, of which 80 are now in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. His cabinet was very popular and several books mentioned it or had it as a subject, including Houbraken in his \"Schouburgh\" when he claimed it held portraits of over 100 people (Houbraken was writing in 1712).\n\nThe most notable book was published by the man who purchased his collection after Van Halen died in 1732, Michiel de Roode. De Roode published the book in 1773 as a member of Leiden's learned society ‘Kunst wordt door arbeid verkreegen’ (art is accomplished by work) which paid for the edition.

The expedition's main participants were the two Roosevelt brothers, the naturalist George K. Cherrie, the photographer C. Suydam Cutting, two experienced hunters from Bandipur and several other Hindustani-speaking men who joined the expedition in Srinagar. The Roosevelts secured permission from the Chinese government to cross the Himalayas into Chinese territory.\n\nGeorge Cherrie went by freighter with the expedition's equipment, along with four cougar hounds, to Karachi. Theodore and Kermit Roosevelt with Suydam Cutting departed from New York City on 11 April 1925 aboard SS Leviathan. In England they secured, with the help of the Soviet envoy Rakovsky, permission to enter the Russian Pamirs. Stopping in Paris to buy presents for Asians they might encounter, the three Americans went by rail to Marseilles and then by ship to Bombay, arriving on May 11th. On May 19th the expedition left Srinagar with a caravan of 60 ponies. Via the Zoji Pass they reached Leh about June 1st and then collected several specimens of the barhal and the Tibetan antelope. For more than 2 weeks, the expedition journeyed through the high Himalayas and lost 14 of their 60 ponies, before reaching Sanju Bazaar in eastern Turkestan on July 5th. A few days later the party reached Yarkand, where they split up.

Grundy grew up in Dallas in the U.S. state of Texas. He now lives in Shinrone, County Offaly, Ireland. He has over two dozen published books and a number of published papers. He is best known for his modern adaptations of legendary sagas and also a non-fiction writer on Germanic mythology, Germanic paganism, and Germanic neopaganism.\n\nGrundy began working on his first complete novel during his first year at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where he was studying English and German philology. Originally, the novel was intended to be based on the Anglo-Saxon epic poem \"Beowulf\", but Grundy was convinced by his professor Dr. Stephen Flowers (author of numerous widely respected works about Germanic history and magic) that the Nibelung legend would be a more appropriate basis for a first novel.\n\nGrundy wrote most of the novel in a dormitory at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, where he spent one year as an exchange student. He also spent a year as an exchange student in Bonn, Germany - virtually at the foot of the \"Drachenberg\" - spending some of his time on research for his novel (which also led him all across Scandinavia). \"Rhinegold\" — a retelling of the entire Sigurð cycle dedicated to, among others, Richard Wagner and J. R. R. Tolkien — came out in 1994, and quickly developed into an international best-seller. In 1995, Grundy received his PhD from the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge with a dissertation on Odin: \"The Cult of Óðinn: God of Death?\".\n\nTerri Windling identified \"Rhinegold\" as one of the best fantasy debuts of 1994, describing it as \"both scholarly and entertaining\".\n\nTwo years later, 1996, Grundy completed \"Attila’s Treasure\", focused less on Attila the Hun than on Grundy’s favorite legendary figure, Hagen. This novel, too, was an international success, but to a lesser degree than the forerunner novel \"Rhinegold.\"\n\nThis was followed in 1999 by \"Gilgamesh,\" a modern adaptation of the Sumerian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" that attempts to address directly the homosexual nature of the original text largely ignored by modern scholars. This was less well received than the two earlier novels. \n\nWith Melodi Lammond-Grundy, Grundy has since published the Falcon Dreams series, a trilogy first published in German and available in English in e-book format: \"Falcon’s Flight\" (2000), \"Eagle and Falcon\" (2002), and \"Falcon’s Night\" (2002).\n\nBefore publishing his first novel, Grundy published, as Kveldulf Gundarsson, two books on Germanic neopaganism and Germanic magic. He has since edited and co-written both editions of the handbook of The Troth, \"Our Troth\", and written other works on ancient and modern Germanic paganism and Germanic culture.\n\nGrundy was previously Lore Warden and Master of the Elder Training Program for the Ring of Troth (now known simply as The Troth) and carried on the organization's tradition of being based in scholarship, started by Edred Thorsson. Mattias Gardell also regards him as important in the organization's move to the left and development of a \"strict antiracist and antisexist ideology.\" He is cited by other writers on Germanic paganism inside and outside academia, for example as Grundy by Jenny Blain in her discussion of the social role of \"seiðr\" in Iceland, also as Grundy by Julia Bolton Holloway on pagan priestesses, and by Charlotte Hardman and Graham Harvey in their survey of neo-paganism for editing \"Our Troth\", \"a large work collecting articles about almost every conceivable issue of importance to Asatrúar\" as well as having \"clarified the group's objection to fascism and racism.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5001978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5001978", "title": "The Green Book (IRA)", "text": "The Green Book (IRA)\n\nThe Green Book is a training and induction manual issued by the Irish Republican Army to new volunteers. It was used by the post-Irish Civil War Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Cumann na mBan, (\"League of Women\"), along with later incarnations such as the Provisional IRA (PIRA). It includes a statement of military objectives, tactics and conditions for military victory against the British government. This military victory was to be achieved as part of \"the ongoing liberation of Ireland from foreign occupiers\". The Green Book has acted as a manual of conduct and induction to the organisation since at least the 1950s.\n\nBecause the IRA and later republican groupings have been identified as illegal organisations (the PIRA, IRA & Cumann na mBan have been proscribed - declared illegal - in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and a number of other countries) The Green Book has been distributed and published secretly. It is published at unknown printing presses and distributed to or shared with IRA volunteers as they are accepted for active duty. Due to this secrecy only two editions of the Green Book have so far been released into the public domain. The first, published in 1956, appears to be intact. The second, publication date unknown but dating to the 1977 detention of then IRA Chief of Staff Seamus Twomey, has only been released in three parts (referred to here as the 1977 edition). With the beginning of the latest IRA ceasefire and the 2005 ending of their campaign, it seems unlikely that a new edition of the manual will have been issued in recent years by the IRA. However, it is possible that known/unknown groupings have issued a more recent version.\nThe Green Book is issued to IRA volunteers as part of their training and is considered a secret document which should not be revealed to, or discussed with non-IRA members. In order to protect the organisation, disclosure of its training material and any other training documents, including the Green Book, would most likely carry stiff penalties up to and including Court Martial. Once issued, each volunteer is expected to study and learn from his/her copy of the manual, to apply the rules given in it, and to apply lessons learnt from it. While the manual is clearly not all the training a volunteer could expect, it gave a broad overview meant to go some way to preparing the volunteer for active duty with the organisation.\n\nBoth known issues of the Green Book were in existence while the IRA, (in the case of the 1956 edition), and the PIRA, (in the case of the 1977 edition), were engaged in a military campaign. In 1956, this was the Border Campaign, in the 1970s it was the terrorist Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997.\n\nCommonalities and differences exist between the two documents. This demonstrates that the Green Book is a living document updated periodically. These updates are made to reflect changes in:\n\n\nWhile splits in the IRA since 1922 up to the 1950s do not appear to be noted in the 1956 document, developments in the fields of insurgency and counter-insurgency are. Both T. E. Lawrence and Field Marshal Sir William Slim are quoted. The 1977 edition appears to have been more heavily influenced by the work of Brigadier General Frank Kitson. \n\nBy the 1977 edition, the document had increased in scope, with length remaining around the same. Some doctrinal sections from the 1956 edition were still appearing, while new sections aimed at combating the counter-insurgency efforts of the British Army and RUC had appeared. Notably the 1977 edition would have existed alongside the IRA's change in tactics towards the entirely self-reliant cell structure. The 1956 edition on the other hand discusses the use of the IRA flying column - en masse attacks by large groups of volunteers against concentrations of the enemy. Another notable facet of the 1977 edition is the attention paid to the mental preparation of IRA Volunteers, this being the time of the IRA's \"Long War\" strategy. Readers of the 1977 edition are warned:\n\n\"The Army as an organisation claims and expects your total allegiance without reservation. It enters into every aspect of your life. It invades the privacy of your home life, it fragments your family and friends, in other words claims your total allegiance. All potential volunteers must realise that the threat of capture and of long jail sentences are a very real danger and a shadow which hangs over every volunteer...\"\n\n\"Another important aspect all potential volunteers should think about is their ability to obey orders from a superior officer. All volunteers must obey orders issued to them by a superior officer regardless of whether they like the particular officer or not\". \n\nThe 1956 edition contains no such warning, but appeals to the \"guerrilla code.\" In 'Chapter Five - Organisation and Arms', the reader is advised:\n\n\"Leadership will not come so much by appointment as by the trust the guerrillas place in their commander. He must be worthy of that trust if he is to succeed. Instead of discipline of the regular army type there will be a more stern battle discipline: agreement on the job to be done, and the need to do it, and obedience to the guerrilla code, these take the place of the unthinking army type discipline. Breaches of the guerrilla code — desertion, betrayal, breach of confidence in any way — must be severely dealt with on the spot\".\n\nThe book contains information on: \n\n\nThe book has also included references to the training, development, and tactics employed by Regular & Irregular/Specialist forces in modern armies - particularly those of the British Army.\n\nThe 1956 document couches the violence and occupation of the island of Ireland in a long history of armed resistance to occupation. The first chapter is entirely taken up with providing this history from the viewpoint of the organisation. It provides information on the Kerne, the battle of the Yellow Ford, Owen Roe O'Neill, the 1798 Rebellion and United Irishmen, James Fintan Lalor, and the \"Tan War\". All are described as being within the context of legitimate resistance to the occupation of Ireland. This discussion is largely romanticised and aimed at demonstrating a lineage of \"armed struggle\" from which the IRA assumes its legitimacy in the fight against \"occupying forces in Ireland\". One entry in this discussion is the fact that the efforts of IRA guerrillas were the direct cause in ending the British occupation of the 26 counties of Ireland—the territory that would become the Irish Free State, and later the Republic of Ireland. The 1956 manual also implies that the bulk of the IRA's work in \"freeing Ireland from occupation\" is over. This indicates both a \"southern\" perspective on Irish independence and an underestimation of the resistance they would encounter during the Border Campaign, that was aimed at the end of British rule in Northern Ireland. With the publication of the 1977 edition this assumption of an easy victory in ending partition had been dropped and the \"Long War\" strategy adopted.\n\nThe 1956 edition summarises the result of the violence during the 1919-1921 Irish War of Independence (referred to by republicans, who considered independence as having been only partially achieved, as the Tan War) with this passage:\n\n\"The hammer blows of the guerrillas destroyed the British administration. The guerrillas acted in small numbers in the right localities and compelled the British to disperse to find them. Then as the British searched, they hit them at will by means of the ambush. Communications were systematically destroyed and even the British army's transport system in the country was disorganised.\"\n\n\"The enemy's intelligence service was completely dislocated. The R.I.C.- the eyes and ears of British rule- was demoralised. British justice courts could not operate--for the people ignored them. The British gradually were forced to evacuate the smaller, more isolated garrisons. They concentrated in the larger towns. The areas evacuated came under sole control of The Republic. The next step was to isolate the larger centres and keep cutting communications and constantly hitting the enemy. In time these would have been evacuated too. Thus ended the last great phase of guerrilla operations against British rule in Ireland.\"\n\nCompare to the Marxist intrepretation in the 1977 edition, published during a new campaign and new conditions of waging war. The \"struggle\" is couched in more socio-economic terms, terms which would have made more sense to a generation living through unemployment and economic hardship in post industrial revolution Northern Ireland (referred to here as the \"six counties\"). It is also an indication of the influence of Marxist Philosophy that permeated the IRA in the late 1970s:\n\n\"The objective of the 800 years of oppression 'is economic exploitation with the unjustly partitioned 6 counties remaining Britain's directly controlled old-style colony' and the South under the 'continuing social, cultural and economic domination of London'. This last led to Irish savings being invested in England 'for a higher interest rate' and many hundreds of thousands of boys and girls from this country had to emigrate to England to seek the employment which those exported saving created.\" \n\n\"Another aspect of economic imperialism at work is the export of raw, unprocessed materials: live cattle on the hoof - mineral wealth, fish caught by foreign trawlers, etc. Further, from 1956 on, the Free State abandoned all attempts to secure an independent economy, and brought in foreign multi-national companies to create jobs instead of buying their skills and then sending them home gradually. Africanisation' is the word for this process elsewhere. Control of our affairs in all of Ireland lies more than ever since 1921 outside the hands of the Irish people. The logical outcome of all this was full immersion in the E.E.C. in the 1970s. The Republican Movement opposed this North and South in 1972 and 1975 and continues to do so. It is against such political economic power blocks East and West and military alliances such as NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\"\n\nWhile the 1956 edition does not engage in any legitimisation of the struggle beyond the historical context of resistance to occupation, the 1977 edition does - claiming direct legitimacy from the members of the Second Dáil who transferred their authority to the IRA in 1938 after the takeover of the IRA Army Council by Seán Russell. This had always been the official ideology of the IRA, however after the split between the Provisional IRA and the Official IRA in 1969 it was probably deemed necessary to lay more of a claim to the historical struggle than the pre-split IRA had felt necessary. The 1956 edition would have also been published for use during a period when the failed S-Plan or Sabotage campaign was within living memory of younger IRA volunteers. Newer volunteers needed to be reminded of previous IRA activity in the \"struggle for liberation\":\n\n\"The moral position of the Irish Republican Army, its right to engage in warfare, is based on: \n\n\"In 1938 the seven surviving faithful Republican Deputies delegated executive powers to the Army Council of the I.R.A. per the 1921 resolution. In 1969 the sole surviving Deputy, Joseph Clarke, reaffirmed publicly that the then Provisional Army Council and its successors were the inheritors of the first and second Dáil as a Provisional Government.\"\n\nIn November 2003, during testimony to the Saville Inquiry on the events of Bloody Sunday, Martin McGuinness, the alleged former Chief of Staff of the IRA, denied that he had ever read such a book before reputedly leaving the IRA in 1974. McGuinness reportedly said: \"When I was in the IRA there was no such book, I don't know when it came into existence.\" When asked what the phrase \"green book\" meant, he stated: \"I think it means the book was green.\"\n\nThe 1977 edition of the Green Book is very much focused on the mental strength of the volunteer. The manual is eager to draw a clear distinction between volunteer and his enemy:\n\n\"A member of the I.R.A. is such by his own choice, his convictions being the only factor which compels him to volunteer, his objectives the political freedom and social and economic justice for his people. Apart from the few minutes in the career of the average Brit that he comes under attack, the Brit has no freedom or personal initiative. He is told when to sleep, where to sleep, when to get up, where to spend his free time etc.\"\n\nIn the 1977 edition, the term guerrilla is dropped in favour of \"volunteer\"; the new edition also stresses that this volunteer is part of a movement with common aims and objectives. From the PIRA's point of view, this would have been necessary to combating competing interpretations encountered in the community and the propaganda efforts of the enemy they faced:\n\n\"Before we go on the offensive politically or militarily we take the greatest defensive precautions possible to ensure success, e.g. we do not advocate a United Ireland without being able to justify our right to such a state as opposed to partition; we do not employ revolutionary violence as our means without being able to illustrate that we have no recourse to any other means. Or in more everyday simple terms: we do not claim that we are going to escalate the war if we cannot do just that; we do not mount an operation without first having ensured that we have taken the necessary defensive precautions of accurate intelligence, security, that weapons are in proper working order with proper ammunition and that the volunteers involved know how to handle interrogations in the event of their capture etc, and of course that the operation itself enhances rather than alienates our supporters.\"\n\nThe 1956 edition on the other hand stresses the physical aspects of IRA operations:\n\n\"Outside of the support he [the guerrilla] gets from the people among whom he operates-and this support must never be underestimated for it is vital to his eventual success-he fights alone. He is part of an independent formation that is in effect an army by itself. He must be self-contained. If necessary he must act alone and fight alone with the weapons at his disposal- and these very often will not be of the best. He must find his own supplies. His endurance has to be great: and for this he needs a fit body and an alert mind. Above all he must know what he is fighting for- and why.\"\n\nThe 1977 edition describes the military objectives of the IRA as:\n\n\"The position of the Irish Republican Army since its foundation in 1916 has been one of sustained resistance and implacable hostility to the forces of imperialism, always keeping in the forefront of the most advanced revolutionary thinking and the latest guerrilla warfare techniques in the world.\"\n\nThe enemy is described as:\n\n\"The establishment is all those who have a vested interest in maintaining the present status quo in politicians, media, judiciary, certain business elements and the Brit war machine comprising, the Brit Army, the U.D.R., R.U.C. (r) [reserve], Screws, Civilian Searchers. The cure for these armed branches of the establishment is well known and documented. But with the possible exceptions of the Brit Ministers in the 'Northern Ireland Office' and certain members of the judiciary, the overtly unarmed branches of the establishment are not so clearly identifiable to the people as our enemies as say armed Brits or R.U.C.\"\n\nThe military objects of the IRA in 1977 are presented as closely tied to the political objectives of politicising the citizenry. Rather than the tactic of surgical strike, the tactic of continuous escalation or the strategy of what has been called the PIRA's Tet offensive is preferred:\n\n\"By now it is clear that our task is not only to kill as many enemy personnel as possible but of equal importance to create support which will carry us not only through a war of liberation which could last another decade but which will support us past the 'Brits Out' stage to the ultimate aim of a Democratic Socialist Republic.\"\n\n\"The Strategy is: \n\nThe 1956 edition stresses military objectives and barely mentions political objectives. It contains a lot of practical advice on operating as a guerrilla fighter and how to inflict damage on targets. No mention is made of the establishment of \"a Democratic Socialist Republic\". This can probably been seen in the context of the IRA keeping pace with social changes and the material aspirations of Irish men and women living within the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. At the time of the Border Campaign the communities the IRA came to rely on were not politicised to the same degree as those in 1977. A lack of support within their host community is commonly given as the reason for the failure of the Border Campaign. This edition of the Green Book even goes so far as to announce the aim of restoring the Irish language as the national language, an aim not mentioned in the earlier edition.\n\nThe 1977 edition of the Green Book makes little mention of arms and equipment available to the volunteer. The one entry that does appear deals only with the issue of tactics as affected by lack of weaponry:\n\n\"Tactics are dictated by the existing conditions. Here again the logic is quite simple. Without support Volunteers, Dumps, Weapons, Finance, etc., we cannot mount an operation, much less a campaign. In September 1969 the existing conditions dictated that the Brits were not to be shot, but after the Falls curfew all Brits were to the people acceptable targets. The existing conditions had been changed.\"\n\nThe 1956 edition goes into a lot of detail on arms that the volunteer can expect to encounter and how to use them. Explosives are detailed alongside what the guerrilla should know about handling & preparing them. The sabotage techniques and weaponry available at the time had mostly ceased to be commonly used by the late 1970s, namely:\n\nDetonators are also detailed with physical descriptions, handling instructions, and burning rates. Detonators covered include: Cordtex and FID.\n\nSmall arms listed range from the revolver, to the shotgun and submachine gun up to the flame thrower, which was almost never used, except for an attack on British soldiers of the King's Own Scottish Borderers. It can be assumed that the use of these weapons, or at least supplies of them, had been diminished when the 1977 edition was published. Given that the organisation was having troubles with internal security, it may have also been considered a security risk for the IRA to detail its available weaponry too closely.\n\nA generation earlier, IRA units operating during the S-Plan / Sabotage campaign did not have access to the above material, with the exception of Gelignite. IRA explosive devices of the 1930s and 1940s were prepared using materials such as Potassium chlorate, Carbide, Saxonite, Iron Oxide, Aluminium, sulfuric acid etc. By the time of the Northern Campaign (IRA) c. 1942, IRA Eastern Command, in cooperation with IRA Western Command could raise 12 tons of weapons and explosives at short notice. This was excluding the tons of weapons and explosives seized during the S-Plan campaign.\n\nWhen the IRA split in the early 1970s into the Official IRA and Provisional IRA, they divided the arms held in IRA weapons dumps. The Provisional IRA obtained the majority of these weapons. For details on the types of arms recently decommissioned by the IRA as part of their permanent cessation of violence see the article on the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and a breakdown of the PIRA's weapons before decommissioning took place in September 2005.\n\nThe 1977 edition stresses that the volunteer is ultimately responsible within the framework of the movement for ensuring the formulation, dissemination and efficiency of propaganda. This process was to begin within the mind of the volunteer himself:\n\n\"A new recruit's immediate obstacle is the removal of his (her) ignorance about how to handle weapons, military tactics, security, interrogations etc. An O.C.'s [Commanding Officer] might be how to put a unit on a military footing; an I.O.'s [Intelligence Officer] how to create an effective intelligence network; a Cumann na mBan Chairman's how best to mount a campaign on a given issue, e.g. H Blocks etc., and for all members of the movement regardless of which branch we belong to, to enhance our commitment to and participation in the struggle through gaining as comprehensive an understanding as possible of our present society and the proposed Republican alternative through self and group education.\"\n\nThe stated war objectives of the IRA within the 1977 document included the success of national and international propaganda as a war objective:\n\n\"We exploit these mistakes [mistakes by the British Army] by propagating the facts. So it was with their murderous mistakes of the Falls Road curfew, Bloody Sunday and internment, which were exploited to our advantage support- wise as was the murder of John Boyle in Dunloy.\"\n\nThe 1956 edition is a lot more practical, suggesting a more limited, less well oiled organisational machine of the IRA then than today:\n\n\"The main channels of information available to the guerrillas are newspapers, leaflets, radio, word of mouth. Other methods may be worked out and new ones invented. For example: \nPainting of slogans, proclamations and manifestoes and so on. All the means of winning the confidence of the people must be utilised. The ideas of the movement must be so popularised that no one is in doubt-least of all the enemy-that it will win eventually.\"\n\n\"This information service must function continuously to get maximum results. Among the things it must do are:\n\n\"The world must know and understand what is being done, what the enemy is trying to destroy and why, and the way these things can be ended and peace restored and freedom won. The use of regular bulletins for foreign newspapers and news-agencies becomes a necessity. The bulletin should be of the documentary type: no room for emotional pleas or the like. Just the facts.\"\n\nWhile IRA volunteers also engaged in the above efforts, the techniques are not described in the 1977 Green Book.\n\nThe 1956 edition contains no details on how to react to internment, capture, interrogation, or interrogation techniques. This was no doubt an oversight on the part of the IRA, one which they came to regret with the successful interrogation of IRA volunteers captured by their enemies.\n\nBy 1977, with the launching of the IRA's campaign in Northern Ireland in 1969, the technical capabilities & anti-insurgency apparatus of the RUC, as well as the Regular and Specialist forces of the British Army had advanced. Coupled with this were technical advances in the intelligence gathering and interrogation techniques of those forces. The combination of these factors alongside political determination to capture and kill IRA forces and subdue the nationalist population of Northern Ireland led to changes in the Green Book. \n\nMuch more stress was placed on resisting interrogation in what has been called The Green Book II. If captured, the PIRA volunteer is warned to remain mentally implacable:\n\nA series of tactics employed by interrogators are listed along with the stages the interrogation process the volunteer should expect to go through: physical torture, subtle psychological torture, and humiliation.\n\nThe remainder of the document persists in a similar vein, constantly stressing the dangers of submitting to interrogation techniques. This highlights the increasing threat the PIRA realised interrogations were having against the organisation. Most likely this was a result of experience gained throughout the 1970s and during the Border Campaign when arrest and imprisonment of IRA/PIRA volunteers seriously impacted the operational effectiveness of the respective organizations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11028525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11028525", "title": "The Simpsons Game", "text": "The Simpsons Game\n\nThe Simpsons Game is an action platformer video game based on the animated television series \"The Simpsons\" and loosely on \"The Simpsons Movie\", made for the Nintendo DS, Wii, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The game was developed, published, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by \"The Simpsons\" writers Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton. In the self-referential plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another \"The Simpsons\" video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at popular culture, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.\n\nThe game follows the five Simpson family members—Homer, Marge (with Maggie), Bart, and Lisa—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their 8-bit predecessors from Will Wright, and the creator of their video game character selves, Matt Groening. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.\n\nThe game was met with mixed reception from video game critics. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor camera system, which did not always function properly. \"The Simpsons Game\" received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 Spike Video Game Awards and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the 2007 Writers Guild of America Awards. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.\n\nPlayers of \"The Simpsons Game\" are able to control the Simpson family (except Maggie), each with their own unique abilities. Two different family members are playable in each level, aside from the tutorial level, \"The Land of Chocolate\", in which only Homer is playable, and the final level, \"Game Over\", where all members of the family are playable. The game contains sixteen levels, called episodes, and each requires specific powers to complete. For example, in the fourth episode, \"Lisa the Tree Hugger\", the player is required to use Lisa's \"Hand of Buddha\" power to move large objects, and Bart's slingshot to shut down machines. Enemies unique to each episode are featured, with the exception of the final level, in which enemies that have already been defeated are \"recycled\" with different colors.\n\nSeveral challenges are made available after all episodes are completed. These include finding all the collectibles for each character, finding all the video game clichés, and in the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS versions, completing a certain task related to each episode's plot in a time trial.\n\n\"The Simpsons Game\"s head-up display features health meters for both characters in each level, and an attack meter and special power meter for the character currently controlled by the player. The game features a two player co-op mode, which has a split screen and allows each player to control one of the two characters featured on that level.\n\nThe DS version of the game was developed separately from its console counterparts and is a side scrolling adventure. It also offers several features that are not available in the other versions. Several minigames are available to unlock and play, most which are updated versions of arcade games such as \"Frogger\" and \"Space Invaders\", the latter which references the aliens Kang and Kodos from the \"Simpsons Treehouse of Horror\" episodes. A virtual pet is also accessible, called \"Pet Homer\", which allows players to feed, entertain, and save Homer from threats such as choking and heart attacks.\n\nHomer is the first playable character available to the player in \"The Land of Chocolate\" level. His abilities involve turning into the \"Homer ball\" by eating food power-ups to let him roll and slam objects; turn into a Gummi Homer by eating small gummi \"Venus de Milos\" to shoot gummi grenades; eat hot chili peppers to become Insanity Pepper Homer to use lava and fire bombs; and inhale helium to become a balloon to float in the air. Homer's special power is a giant burp, which can stun enemies. Bart first appears in the second level of the game \"Bartman Begins\". He can turn into Bartman, allowing him to use zip-lines, climb certain walls, glide over long distances, and do other acrobatic feats. Bart's special power is releasing a flood of bats towards enemies. He can use his slingshot to defeat enemies and hit targets from afar.\n\nLisa is introduced in the fourth level \"Lisa the Tree Hugger\". Her main attack style is kicking, and her power is the \"Hand of Buddha\". She can use it to flick, smash, freeze, or send lightning bolts to enemies, as well as lift certain items. Lisa's special power is playing her saxophone to attack and stun enemies. As the levels progress, Lisa can use her saxophone to turn enemies against each other. Marge is the least-playable character. Introduced in the fifth level, \"Mob Rules\", Marge learns her power is to make large crowds obey her. She can use her mob to break down obstacles, build objects, attack enemies, and repair objects. Maggie is, in effect, an extension of Marge, briefly playable in air ducts and other small spaces.\n\nThe game begins with Homer having a candy-induced fantasy about a world of chocolate where he tries to catch and eat a white chocolate rabbit; upon waking up he is upset to find that it was all a dream.\n\nBart goes to the video game store and coerces the clerk to let him buy the new and violent \"Grand Theft Scratchy\" game, only to have it confiscated by Marge. While Bart mopes, a video game manual falls down from the sky in front of him. Reading through the manual, Bart discovers that he and the rest of his family have special powers. Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph from stealing from the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a deforestation project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of \"Grand Theft Scratchy\" in Springfield, although Lisa points out it is ironic she used violence to stop a violent game.\n\nDuring dinner, the family is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an argument about what they should be doing with them. Aliens Kang and Kodos decide to strike Earth, and an alien invasion unfolds. Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit Professor Frink. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the game engine where all video games are made. After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them \"The Simpsons Game\"s player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid Captain McCallister in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they save the Springfield Mall and Cletus from the aliens.\n\nIn order to find out the truth, the family turns to the Internet to discover more about the powers they have in the game, but are accidentally sent to the game engine when Homer spills beer over the keyboard. There, they discover Will Wright, who is destroying copies of an old 8-bit \"The Simpsons\" game and its characters. The family manages to save their 8-bit predecessors before they are destroyed by Wright, and discover that they will also become obsolete when the next \"The Simpsons\" game is released. The only way to prevent this is to talk to the creator of the games and convince him not to destroy them. In order to access his mansion, the family needs to acquire four key cards from four upcoming \"Simpsons\" games. First, Homer and Marge defeat a two-headed dragon whose heads are those of Patty and Selma in the \"Neverquest\" game. Marge and Lisa then travel to \"Grand Theft Scratchy\", eliminating all offensive material and replacing it with more family-friendly material. Next, Homer and Bart travel to France during World War II to thwart Mr. Burns' plan to steal priceless French paintings, in the \"Medal of Homer\" game. Lisa and Homer then travel to ancient Japan to defeat the evil Mr. Dirt and his \"Sparklemon\" in the \"Big Super Happy Fun Fun Game\".\n\nOnce they have all four key cards, Bart and Homer infiltrate the creator's mansion. They are greeted by Matt Groening, who sends \"Futurama\" characters Bender and Dr. Zoidberg after them. The family manages to defeat them, however, and Groening admits that he is only creating new games for the money, and destroys the game engine. The Simpsons, along with several other characters from the games, escape to Springfield, where the aliens are still attacking. Lisa uses her power to create a stairway to heaven in order for the family to ask God for advice. After he is defeated in a game of \"Dance Dance Revolution\", God reveals that the video game that they're in is a mini-game in another video game about Earth. He dropped the video game manual by accident, thus endowing the family with superpowers. Realizing his misdemeanor, he promises to restore Springfield, let them keep their powers, and to improve the working conditions of all video game characters. He also gives Homer three wishes. Lisa asks if God ever wonders if he himself is a character in a video game. As God nervously scoffs at this theory, it turns out that Ralph Wiggum is playing the entire game before he looks at the screen, wondering who was looking at him.\n\nThe game's storyline was written by Tim Long, Matt Selman, and Matt Warburton, who are all regular writers on \"The Simpsons\". They wanted to create something that appealed to the fans of the show, and was, in its own right, \"a great new game\". Matt Groening and the writers had continuous feedback on the game's content, from its \"look and feel\" to its puzzles and gameplay. The game's executive producer, Scot Amos, said it was an amazing partnership between the writers and the developers. Selman, the head writer, says the reason they decided to call it \"The Simpsons Game\" and not add a subtitle was because they felt it was a restart of \"the 'Simpsons' gaming franchise [...] a big, new, fresh game that takes on video games and hilarious things of all time\".\n\"The Simpsons Game\" was published by Electronic Arts and developed by its subsidiary, EA Redwood Shores; the company had signed a contract for the video game rights to \"The Simpsons\" in 2005. The game's lead designer, Greg Rizzer, said that when he asked his bosses if they could parody some Electronic Arts games including \"Medal of Honor\", they were enthusiastic about it. \"The Simpsons Game\", which parodies video games from 30 years prior to 2007, was forced to have some of its content removed after several video game companies complained about it. Rizzer, however, was still pleased with the amount of parody in the game and considered \"The Simpsons\" the \"perfect vehicle to poke fun at the games industry\". At the 2007 Games Convention in Leipzig, Germany, a poster for \"Grand Theft Scratchy\", one of the levels in \"The Simpsons Game\" and a parody of \"Grand Theft Auto\", was asked to be taken down by an employee of Rockstar Games, the company that develops the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series of video games. Several companies, however, embraced the game's parody of their video games, including developers from Harmonix, who were pleased with the game's \"Sitar Hero\", a parody of Harmonix's \"Guitar Hero\" video game. In addition to game parodies, \"The Simpsons Game\" also features several cameos with satirical spins, including Matt Groening as himself and Will Wright as an antagonist.\n\nThe graphics for the game's characters are cel-shaded, and an implemented technique helps flatten the character models from any angle that the camera views them from, in order to recreate the 2D, hand-drawn look seen in the show. The development team found it particularly difficult to render Lisa's spiky hair as 2D in the game's 3D environment. The Wii version has lower-quality graphics than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions due to the console's inferior hardware. There is a different cover for the game on each console.\n\nThe game received mixed reception, receiving an aggregated score of 71% on Metacritic for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version of the game. Praise focused on the game's visuals and writing, which lampooned the gaming industry and the show itself. \"The Simpsons Game\" won the award for Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show at the Spike Video Game Awards 2007, and was nominated for the first-ever award for Best Video Game Writing at the Writers Guild of America Awards 2007. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold overall. Its PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS releases each received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies per version in the United Kingdom. ELSPA presented the game's Wii, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable versions with \"Silver\" certifications, for sales of 100,000 units or more each in the region. Peter Nowak of CBC News named it the third-best game of 2007 and described it as \"easily the best game starring the wacky residents of Springfield\".\n\nThe game's use of \"The Simpsons\"-style humor received a mixed reception. Both GameSpot and GameTrailers said that the game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual \"The Simpsons\" fans by IGN and GameDaily, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems that the game had, GameSpy said that it was worth it to see the humorous parodies. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that those interested in \"The Simpsons\" humor should purchase a box set of one of the television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of \"Game Informer\" called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.\n\nEurogamer praised the involvement of people from \"The Simpsons\" television series with the game's development and GameZone enjoyed the two-character mechanics of the game and had fun collecting unlockable items. GameTrailers thought the graphics and animations looked great and appreciated the hand-drawn appearances, even though they found it obvious that the characters were \"never really meant to jump into the third dimension\" because of their second-dimension roots.\n\nCriticism of the game focused on its short, uninspiring gameplay and troublesome camera system. GameSpot considered the gameplay \"nothing special\" while GameZone called it a \"pretty shallow\" game that depended too much on repetitive jumping puzzles and a weak combat system. The game disappointed IGN because it did not include an online feature and it was deemed too short. The camera system was found to be problematic by both GameZone and GameSpy, who called it \"a pain\" and a \"busted\" feature; GameDaily also found it bothersome because it often got stuck.\n\nThe DS version of the game, which was significantly different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying from start to finish. GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief. 1UP found that even though \"The Simpsons Game\" parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.\n\nElectronic Arts planned to produce a sequel to the game, entitled \"The Simpsons Game 2\", along with a Nintendo Wii version of \"Dead Space 2\", but both were cancelled in 2011 because the studio decided to make room for other projects.\n\n"}

The industrial revolution was considered as a turning point for great changes in cities but this change belongs mostly to western cities that existed prior to the 20th century. The fast development and prosperity of urban planning discussed here refers to the first years of 20th century.\n\nIn recent years, exacerbation of urban problems has formed two views on urban planning Iran.\n\nThis approach asserts that there are not suitable conditions and enough infrastructure to use acceptable new tools in urban planning and states that planners have to follow their traditional way in urban plans.\n\nThinkers of this approach believe that qualitative changes during the time, insufficient pattern in urban development plans to cater for the demands of society, globalization, and the necessity of adapting to changes with urban plans, necessitate the use of a new pattern in society.\n\nIt recognizes the limitations and problems in these plans in the context of Iran and offers a systematic approach as a transition tool from comprehensive approach to strategic approach in the urban planning system.\n\nThis pattern was formed by Patrick Geddes, who established urban planning, and his student Lewis Mumford. They were biologists who could use the methods of ecology and biology to discuss organic theory in urban planning. Master development plans have been created by combining this theory with new urban functionalism theory over half a century.\n\nTwenty-five years experience of urban planning after the war demonstrated the difficulties of a master plan in Europe. Along with these problems there was increasingly critical opinion about the fundamental theory. During the 1960s and 1970s, theories and experience of urban planning in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, and Japan led to a systematic approach. Final goals of the systematic approach are:\n\n\nSpecifications of strategic-structural plans shows they are better than comprehensive plans. The most important specifics of these plans are:\n\nIranian managers are supporting comprehensive plans despite the fact that such plans were proven outdated in other countries over four decades ago. Support extended by Iranian officials to comprehensive plans is the main challenge facing strategic-structural ones.\n\nThe high capacity of strategic-structural plans to adapt to complicated and changeable social and economic conditions has been proven. But implementation of these plans needs at least a basic foundation in science, theory, economics, law, finance, and administration. Until such preconditions materialize, implementation of a plan with a strategic stance is impossible.\n"}

It was originally developed by THine Electronics, Inc. in 2007 for high-definition televisions but since 2010 V-by-One HS has been widely adopted in various markets such as document processing, automotive infotainment systems, industrial cameras and machine vision, robotics and amusement equipments.\n\nWhile high-definition televisions had generally used LVDS to transmit pixel data, timing-skew problems among conductors appeared by increasing data rate based on requirements of higher-resolution and more color-depth. V-by-One HS, by its SerDes and CDR(Clock recovery) technology, achieves the high speed of 3.75 Gbit/s for each pair of conductors, decreasing the number of conductors, therefore reducing the total costs including cables and connectors. This solves skew problems and reduces electromagnetic interference (or EMI) and power consumption.\n\nHistorically flat panel televisions used LVDS as its internal interface to transmit pixel data but, in accordance with televisions’ higher resolution and expansion in color depth, televisions had to face problems such as increasing numbers of twisted-pair cables and tangible skews problems among cables. V-by-One HS is a standard of a high-speed SerDes, introducing CDR specification and equalizer, that achieves 3.75 Gbit/s (giga bits per second), solves skew problems, and reduces the power consumption and EMI. On behalf of such features, V-by-One HS enables to reduce total costs of interface systems, including costs of cables and connectors. V-by-One HS standard is an open standard and its specification has been delivered by THine Electronics.\n\nEqualizer of V-by-One HS improves data transmitting quality compared with LVDS interface. Because of this specification, it enables to expand data transmission between longer distances.\nIn addition, clock data recovery or CDR solves the skew problems that were more tangible in LVDS interface than ever. CDR technology eliminates any clock cables that LVDS requires with particular fixed frequency clock, resulted in lowering EMI noises. V-by-One HS supports wide range speed from 600 Mbit/s up to 3.75 Gbit/s, enabling lower energy consumption than interface with fixed rate.\n\nLVDS adopters can switch smoothly from LVDS to V-by-One HS without significant changes in products designed.\n\nV-by-One HS has been originally developed to replace internal interfaces of digital pixel displays.\n\nLCDs, different from cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, have to use digital signaling to show each pixel. While notebook PCs started replacing CRT displays to LCDs, pixel data were transmitted as parallel data, interface systems found the problem that more than 20 cables were required to transmit data with 18 bits color depth for each 6-bit RGB color as well as lack of space for cables and difficulty of adjusting skews.\n\nIn order to solve these problems FPD-Link which uses low-voltage differential signaling, or LVDS, were adopted into LCDs. LVDS, defined by the ANSI/TIA/EIA-644-A standard, is a differential signaling system that can run at high speed. LVDS works in serial data transmission. As the main applications had 18 bits color depth in early adoption of FPD-Link, a 7-bit wide differential cable pair for each of 3 channels with another channel for clock became used. By this adoption of FPD-Link, internal interface systems of LCDs could reduce the 22 pair cables into 8 pairs with high-speed serial transmission. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) adopted this as a video standard specification and FPD-Link has penetrated wider as LCD interface.\n\nHowever, in accordance with the fact that LCDs required much higher definition and more color depth as well as more frame rate, FPD-Link faced problems that input pixel data for LCDs increased exponentially and the number of LVDS cables soared as well. For example, full HD television (1920 x 1080 pixels) with a 10-bit color depth and double frame rate requires 24 FPD-Link differential pairs. Such a case has to adjust skews at the level of several hundreds of picoseconds because of much higher-speed clock and data rate. In addition, since LVDS requires a fixed clock frequency that concentrates spectrums, the interface systems have to minimize electromagnetic interference.\n\nFurthermore, since FPD-Link mainly uses electrical digital signaling between zero volts (the ground level) and 1.2 volts based on its standard, it became a significant constraint of designing higher density LSIs. Under such circumstances, many substitutable interfaces such as DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, and V-by-One HS are offered and adopted widely.\n\nDVI and HDMI have widely penetrated as external interfaces between equipments since DVI and HDMI can adjust skews. HDMI also requires hardware implementation of HDCP, a content protection scheme. On the other hand, they had not been adopted as internal interfaces to replace FPD-Link because they require license fees, have functions that are not needed for internal data transmission, and their high voltage differential signals make chip design and manufacturing more difficult. DisplayPort, standardized by VESA to replace FPD-Link, is expecting to penetrate widely. DisplayPort has a similar specification of bias to PCI Express and is expected to have small barriers to design. However, DisplayPort has additional complexity because it is designed to allow one source device to drive multiple monitors, so it uses standardized link speeds and packetized data transfer. This requires DisplayPort sink devices to have circuitry needed to discard packets targeted at other sink devices and to extract data from packets targeted at themselves, and have a memory buffer in order to deal with the speed mismatch between the standardized link speed and the speed the display requires. Multiple monitors might need data at the same time as each other, but DisplayPort can only transmit one micro-packet to one monitor on one differential pair at a time. This is solved by having some micro-packets sent earlier to the monitors before they are needed and having their data buffered at the target monitors until each monitor's display controller needs the data.\n\nUnder such circumstances, V-by-One HS has been developed. The largest differences by V-by-One HS from the other interfaces can be seen in its equalizer and clock/data recovery (CDR) technology. V-by-One HS uses an equalizer in the receiver to help the receiver clean up an incoming signal and therefore helps boost signal integrity. This boost in signal integrity allows V-by-One HS achieve a speed of 3.75 Gbit/s which is higher than what FPD-Link permits. In addition, Its CDR technology solves the skew problems in FPD-Link and eliminates the need for a separate clock signal that generates more electromagnetic interference.\n\nBecause of its higher-speed data transmitting ability, V-by-One HS is expected to reduce the numbers of cables, connectors, their related spaces within the equipments and finally the total costs. For example, Ultra-high definition panels (UHD panel, 3840 × 2160 pixels) requires only 16-pair cables with V-by-One HS technology while it needs 96 pairs of general LVDS cables. V-by-One HS supports wide range of transmitting speeds. Engineers of set makers can adopt it smoothly without significant changes from the existing LVDS interface.\n\n\nThe V-by-One HS Standard is open and delivered by THine Electronics. As of June 30, 2012, the most updated version is “V-by-One HS Standard Version 1.4.”\n\n"}

The paper's circulation of 800 copies was the second-highest in Hampshire County, after the \"South Branch Intelligencer\"'s. The \"Virginia Argus\" ceased publication following its closure by the Union Army during the American Civil War, after which it was not revived.\n\nThe \"Virginia Argus\" documented the pursuit of fugitive slave Jacob Green by the Parsons family of Romney in 1856, and the ensuing dispute between the Parsons family and Charles James Faulkner over legal fees in 1857. At the time of the dispute, Faulkner was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Virginia's 8th congressional district; he later served as the United States Minister to France, and again as a member of the United States House of Representatives from West Virginia's 2nd congressional district.\n\nAmong the newspaper's proprietors was Alexander W. Monroe, a prominent Romney lawyer who had previously served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates (1850–1851). Monroe and co-owner Job N. Cookus left the newspaper to serve in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Following the war, Monroe represented Hampshire County in the West Virginia House of Delegates (1875–1877 and 1879–1883). During the 1875–1877 legislative session, he was the Speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nA. S. Trowbridge founded the \"Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser\" as a Democratic weekly newspaper in Romney in July 1850. Trowbridge had been an educator in New Orleans, Louisiana, before moving to Romney. The \"Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser\" newspaper billed itself as \"A Family Newspaper—Devoted to Politics, Agriculture, Education, General News, and Amusement.\" By October 7, 1852, the \"Virginia Argus\" was being published by Trowbridge & Drinkard; on May 26, 1853, it reverted to being published by Trowbridge alone. After Trowbridge had edited and published the newspaper for seven years, its limited success did not meet his expectations, and in 1857 he sold the operation to Samuel R. Smith and John Joseph Combs.\n\nSmith and Combs operated the newspaper until 1858, when they sold it to James Parsons; he in turn sold it to his younger brother William Miller Parsons in 1859. After a few months of ownership and experience, Parsons sold the newspaper to Alexander W. Monroe, a prominent Romney lawyer and onetime member of the Virginia House of Delegates, and Job N. Cookus in 1861. Monroe and Cookus continued serving as the proprietors, editors, and publishers until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when they joined the Confederate States Army. The newspaper was closed by the Union Army in August 1861, and was not revived after the war.\n\nFollowing his service in the war, Monroe was elected to represent Hampshire County in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1875, during which time he served as the Speaker. He again represented Hampshire County in the House of Delegates from 1879 to 1883. He was the first delegate to represent Hampshire County in both the Virginia General Assembly and the West Virginia Legislature.\n\nThe \"Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser\" had a circulation of 800 copies distributed per week, which was the second largest of the three newspapers published in Hampshire County; the other two were the \"South Branch Intelligencer\" of Romney, with a weekly circulation of 960 copies, and the \"Piedmont Independent\" of Piedmont (now in Mineral County, West Virginia), with a weekly circulation of 600 copies. The offices of the \"Virginia Argus\" were housed in an old stone edifice north of the Hampshire County Courthouse that had previously served as the home of the Romney Academy before its 1846 disestablishment.\n\nIn a series of articles published in the May 14 and 21, 1857 issues of the \"Virginia Argus\", Romney resident Col. Isaac Parsons chronicled the 1855 arrest of his nephew, James Parsons, for attempting to capture Col. Parsons' fugitive slave, Jacob Green, and the resulting dispute between the Parsons family and Charles James Faulkner over legal fees in 1857.\n\nIn August 1855, Green escaped from Parsons' Wappocomo plantation with four other slaves from neighboring plantations. In October of that year, he returned to Col. Parsons' plantation in Romney, and persuaded four or five slaves from neighboring farms owned by Parsons family relatives to escape with him to Pennsylvania.\n\nA party of eight to ten men, including Col. Parsons and two of his nephews, James Parsons and a Mr. Stump, went north in pursuit of the escapees. In the course of the pursuit, they captured two of Stump's escaped slaves, who were sent back to Hampshire County. With information obtained from the two recaptured slaves, Col. Parsons went to Johnstown, James Parsons to Hollidaysburg, and Stump to Altoona, where they hoped to intercept Green as he headed west on the Allegheny Portage Railroad and Main Line Canal toward Pittsburgh. James Parsons intercepted Green at Hollidaysburg, but local abolitionists thwarted his attempt to capture Green, and he was arrested and arraigned for kidnapping.\n\nUpon learning of James Parsons' arrest, Col. Parsons sought the assistance of Charles James Faulkner, a prominent Martinsburg lawyer and United States House Representative from Virginia's 8th congressional district, and of James Murray Mason, a United States Senator from Virginia. Faulkner and Mason both offered their legal services for James Parsons' defense. The Virginia General Assembly pledged its support to Parsons and to Virginia's slaveowners in defending their constitutional rights and to protect them from prosecution. Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise appointed John Randolph Tucker to attend Parsons' trial as a \"special commissioner\" of Virginia. The dispute between Virginia and Pennsylvania escalated, and on January 31, 1856, an article published in the \"New York Herald\" read \"Threatened Civil War between Virginia and Pennsylvania.\"\n\nCol. Parsons, Faulkner, and Tucker traveled to Hollidaysburg for James Parsons' trial. Faulkner provided for Parsons' legal defense, leading to his acquittal as having acted legally under the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.\n\nIn September 1856, Faulkner billed Col. Parsons $150 for his legal services. Parsons disputed the charge. In a series of articles in the \"Virginia Argus\", he declared that Faulkner had originally offered his services at no cost; that he had been lauded publicly for his generosity in doing so without ever denying that he had been working \"pro bono\"; and that he was practicing \"duplicity and deception\" in trying to win a reputation in his district through \"specious acts of munificence\".\n\nFaulkner later served as United States Minister to France; following the American Civil War, he again served as a member of the United States House of Representatives, from West Virginia's 2nd congressional district. James Parsons and his brother William Miller Parsons were later proprietors of the \"Virginia Argus\".\n\nExtant issues of the \"Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser\" are maintained by four known institutions. The American Antiquarian Society Newspaper Project in Worcester, Massachusetts, maintains a 1852 issue of the newspaper; West Virginia University Libraries in Morgantown, West Virginia, maintain issues dating from 1852, 1853, 1856, 1857, and 1859; the West Virginia State Archives in Charleston, West Virginia, maintain an issue dated July 5, 1851; and the Duke University Libraries in Durham, North Carolina, maintain issues dating between 1858 and 1861. The Library of Virginia in Richmond, Virginia also maintains microforms of issues of the \"Virginia Argus\" dating from 1852, 1853, 1856, 1857, and 1859.\n\n\n"}
