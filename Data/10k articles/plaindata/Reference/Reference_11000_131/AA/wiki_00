{"id": "2680754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2680754", "title": "African Writers Series", "text": "African Writers Series\n\nAfrican Writers Series (AWS) is a series of books by African writers that has been published by Heinemann since 1962. The series has ensured an international voice to major African writers—including Chinua Achebe, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, Steve Biko, Ama Ata Aidoo, Nadine Gordimer, Buchi Emecheta, and Okot p'Bitek. The emphasis is on Anglophone Africa, although a number of volumes were translated into English from French, Portuguese, Zulu, Swahili, Acoli, Sesotho, Afrikaans, Luganda and Arabic.\n\nFounded in 1962, the AWS created a forum for many post-independence African writers, and provided texts that African universities could use to address the colonial bias then prominent in the teaching of literature. The books were designed for classroom use, printed solely in paperback to make them affordable for African students. They were published by Heinemann Educational Books (HEB) in London and in various African cities.\n\nThe idea of the series came from Heinemann executive Alan Hill, who \"recognised that the nascent post-colonial publishing industry was not supporting the growth of original African literature\". The first advisory editor to the series was the Nigerian Chinua Achebe – who became one of Africa's most famous writers. Achebe focused first on West African writers, but soon the series branched out, publishing the works of Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o in East Africa, and Nadine Gordimer in South Africa. Achebe left the editorship in 1972. James Currey, the editorial director at Heinemann Educational Books in charge of the African Writers Series from 1967 to 1984, has provided a book-length treatment of the series entitled \"Africa Writes Back\".\n\nAfter a fairly successful beginning, the series faced difficulties that mirrored those that faced the continent. By the mid-1980s, Heinemann published only one or two new titles a year, and much of the back catalogue fell out of print. By the early 1990s, however, the series began to revive—having recently branched into new work, republishing originally locally released texts, and releasing translated works. \n\nThe AWS was relaunched by Pearson Education in 2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15431535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15431535", "title": "Antonine Barada", "text": "Antonine Barada\n\nAntonine Barada (August 22, 1807 – March 30, 1885), alternatively spelled Antoine Barada, was an American folk hero in the state of Nebraska; son of an Omaha mother, he was also called Mo shi-no pazhi in the tribal language. While Barada was an historic man, contemporary accounts of his prodigious strength helped establish him as a regional legend, in the mold of Paul Bunyan and Febold Feboldson. Barada's exploits have been counted as fakelore by historians.\n\nAntoine Barada was born in 1807 at St. Marys, Iowa, which was once located across the Missouri River from Nemaha County, Nebraska. His parents were Michel Barada, a French-American fur trapper and interpreter, and \"Ta-ing-the-hae,\" or \"Laughing Buffalo\", a full-blood Omaha and sister to the chief. His namesake grandfather, Antoine Barada, Sr. (1739–1782), was born in Gascony, France, and was one of the first settlers of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nIn 1813 Antoine was abducted by the Lakota while the family lived near Fort Lisa (Nebraska). Six months later he was returned, after Michel Barada paid the ransom of two ponies. His father immediately sent the boy to live with an aunt in St. Louis. At the age of nine, Antoine returned to the Plains with an Indian hunting party.\n\nAs a young man, Antoine Barada married Marcellite Vient, a French woman from St. Louis. In 1856 they returned to Nebraska to settle on the Nemaha Half-Breed Reservation; because of his half-Omaha ancestry, Barada was eligible for a land patent from the US government. He set up a trading post at the reservation, from which the town of Barada grew. He and his wife settled northeast of Falls City, Nebraska.\n\nBarada's myth is widely known in Nebraska. In \"Love Song to the Plains\", the early 20th-century Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Mari Sandoz stated, \"'Toine Barada stories were told as far as the upper Yellowstone.\" In the 1930s, Louise Pound of the Federal Writer's Project of the Works Progress Administration collected dozens of stories about Barada, many of which are repeated today. One tale reported, \"He was once matched to wrestle with Jean Palos, a Greek wrestling champion... The mighty Palos was notorious for his rough treatment of an opponent. Antonine won the match by pinching his opponent with his toes while he slapped him into unconsciousness with one blow on his ear.\"\n\nBarada was known as a huge man, commonly thought to be almost seven feet tall and widely regarded as a giant. His strength was well known as well, and he was always asked to assist with barn raising, as he would single-handedly hold heavy beams in place while they were fastened down. When local farmers needed assistance loading hogs for market, they would also call on Barada. Rather than use a loading chute, Barada simply picked the hogs up and set them in the wagon. Every time townsfolk needed someone's strength, Barada took the call.\n\nIn 1832 Barada was in St. Louis when he was challenged to prove his strength. He lifted a stone weighing 1,700 pounds, after which point the date of the feat and the weight were inscribed on the stone for future generations. The stone is purported to still stand there. Barada was also widely regarded for his marksmanship. Lore recorded his ability to shoot prairie chickens on the fly from horseback, as well as the ability to shoot two quail from every covey. He was known as a fair hunter, one who never shot a bird on the ground.\n\nOne tale of Barada recounted that while working with a lazy railroad crew in Nebraska, Barada became upset. He grabbed the drop hammer and threw it across the Missouri River, at which point the earth where the hammer fell buckled. The hammer fall created Nebraska's Missouri River breaks. Barada was still angry and slammed his fist down on a pile. It was driven so far into the soil that it pierced a water table. Legend says that all of Nebraska would have flooded from this bung hole if Antoine Barada hadn't plugged it by sitting over it. Antonine was also purportedly involved in the Underground Railroad. Known as the \"Lifeguard of the Missouri\", Barada supposedly saved many slaves from drowning by personally carrying them across the Missouri River from the state of Missouri into Nebraska.\n\nBarada received a patent on of land in 1856 on the Nemaha Half-Breed Reservation. The town of Barada was established in that tract soon after Barada's claim. Barada ran a fur-trading post there for at least 20 years, during which time the town grew around him.\n\nBarada died in 1885 and is buried alongside his wife in the Catholic cemetery just east of Barada, the village that bears his name.\n\nIn 1951 several of Barada's descendants were members of a lawsuit brought against the Government of the United States for recognition of their descent from a full tribal member of the Omaha nation, and their entitlement to compensation related to land allotments and financial benefits received by tribal members. According to the suit, in the 1870s Barada applied to the tribe for membership based on his maternal ancestry. He was rejected due to discriminatory practices by tribal elders and Indian agents. Unlike many Native American tribes, the Omaha have a patrilineal system of descent, so may have rejected Barada because of his French-American father. They considered children with European/white fathers to be \"white\" and did not accept them into the tribe unless they were officially adopted.\n\nIn the 1951 case, the Indian Claims Commission acknowledged there might have been discrimination by the tribe against certain mixed-blood descendants such as Barada; however, the court dismissed the case on the grounds that the Indian Claims Commission did not have jurisdiction over a group claim of individual members; rather, its responsibilities were to adjudicate claims of tribes against the government. The federal government has continued to defer to the federally recognized tribes' sovereignty to determine their own rules for membership and eligibility for voting and benefits.\n\n"}

State of Hawai'i, 314 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir. 2002), was a lawsuit challenging the requirement that candidates for election to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs board of trustees be Native Hawaiians.\n\nIn 2000, after being barred from applying for nomination papers in June because he was not of Hawaiian ancestry, Kenneth R. Conklin was one of 13 plaintiffs in a controversial lawsuit \"Arakaki v. State of Hawai'i\" challenging the requirement that candidates for election to the Office of Hawaiian Affairs board of trustees be Hawaiian. The suit, argued by attorneys H. William Burgess and co-counsel Patrick W. Hanifin, claimed the restriction violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, and the Voting Rights Act. In August, U.S. District Judge Helen Gillmor issued a judgment allowing non-Hawaiians to run for OHA trustee. Conklin then ran unsuccessfully for OHA trustee in November 2000, placing 4th out of 20 candidates for one \"at large\" seat.

{"id": "22719621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22719621", "title": "Bacon: A Love Story", "text": "Bacon: A Love Story\n\nBacon: A Love Story, A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat is a 2009 non-fiction book about bacon, written by American writer Heather Lauer. Lauer started the blog \"Bacon Unwrapped\" and a social networking site about bacon in 2005, after the idea came to her while she was out drinking with her two brothers; her online success inspired her to write the book, which describes curing and cooking bacon, gives over 20 bacon recipes, and analyzes the impact of bacon on popular culture. The text is interspersed with facts about bacon and bacon-related quips from comedian Jim Gaffigan.\n\nThe book had a generally positive reception; \"The Sacramento Bee\" called it \"entertaining and informational\". The \"Toronto Star\" and \"The Sacramento Bee\" recommended it as a Father's Day gift. \"The Portsmouth Herald\" and \"The Arizona Republic\" highlighted the book on lists of summer reading recommendations. \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote that bacon lovers would enjoy the book, but other readers may not so much.\n\n\"Bacon: A Love Story\" contains information on cooking and curing bacon, including \"time-honored methods and traditions\". The book analyzes how bacon has affected popular culture. Lauer includes information on chefs who love of bacon and venues that serve the product throughout the United States. The book contains over 20 recipes for dishes made with bacon, including Bacon Bloody Mary, Bacon-Wrapped Tater Tots, Bacon Bleu Salad, and bacon brownies. Another recipe is Bristol Bacon by chef Duncan Bristol, who owns the restaurant Brick 29 in Nampa, Idaho. Interspersed throughout the book are bits about bacon from comedian Jim Gaffigan, and random information such as that \"Cracker Barrel serves 124 million slices of bacon per year\". Lauer notes, \"Speck is the direct German translation of the word 'bacon, and observes that the word \"creates cross-cultural confusion\". The book's \"Bacon 411\" section provides further information on the product.\n\nBefore the book's publication, Heather Lauer was a public affairs consultant in Arizona. She hatched the idea to write a book about bacon after going out for cocktails with her two brothers in 2005. Lauer explained to \"The Arizona Republic\": \"I was out drinking with my brothers one night, and the topic of bacon came up. We had eaten bacon as kids, and bacon was a special thing on Sunday mornings. Somehow, the idea came up about how funny it would be to start a blog about bacon ... I took it and ran with it.\" She began the blog \"Bacon Unwrapped\", at www.baconunwrapped.com, and a social networking site about bacon at baconnation.ning.com in 2005.\n\nLauer thought that the surge in interest in bacon products prior to the book's publication was \"media driven\". She noted that a response to political correctness as related to cooking and food consumption may have driven interest in the product. Lauer said that bacon seems to be \"the one thing that people are unwilling to give up\". In a post of her blog in March 2009, Lauer lamented those that were willing to posit an end to the trend of interest in bacon. She commented, \"Bacon is something that everybody is familiar with and most people grew up eating. It has a comfort aspect to it and a familiarity. It's also got an addictive aspect to it — that sweet and salty combination of flavors.\" She asserted that interest in the product is as much due to the culture surrounding it as to bacon itself. \"Current food trends focus on eating real and eating local, and there's nothing more real than a delicious strip of bacon. In many U.S. cities, local producers and chefs are making a name for themselves because of bacon,\" said Lauer. She stated that \"most chefs would admit that bacon has long been one of their secret weapons in the kitchen.\" The book was marketed as the \"most comprehensive book about bacon to date\". Lauer promoted her book in a September 2009 appearance as a co-host at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Tour in Pennsylvania, hosted by fellow bacon blogger Jason Mosley (Mr. Baconpants, at mrbaconpants.com).\n\nWriting for \"The Sacramento Bee\", Allen Pierleoni recommended the book as a gift for Father's Day, and called the work \"entertaining and informational, full of anecdotes, history, recipes and explanations of what pork belly has brought to the popular culture\". Rita Zekas of the \"Toronto Star\" also recommended the book as a Father's Day gift. Kerry J. Byrne noted that the book covers \"everything from bacon-curing methods to bacon blogs\" and includes \"easy recipes\". \"Publishers Weekly\" reviewed called the book a \"voluminous look at all things bacon\"; the review concluded, \"Readers who, like Lauer, possess a borderline-obsessive love for bacon are likely to embrace this as their new Bible, but anyone else will quickly get their fill.\" Rachel Forrest of \"The Portsmouth Herald\" recommended the book in her \"Annual Summer Reading List for Foodies\". \"Another of my favorites this year is 'Bacon: A Love Story: A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat' by Heather Lauer. A book all about bacon ... she profiles chefs that use it, odd finds across the nation and plenty of recipes,\" commented Forrest. \"The Arizona Republic\" highlighted the book among its selection of \"Books to help turn pages of summer\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2083588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2083588", "title": "Bahá'í statistics", "text": "Bahá'í statistics\n\nThe Bahá'í World News Service reports a Bahá'í membership of more than 5 million worldwide, in \"virtually every country\" and many territories. Other sources such as Encyclopædia Britannica or the World Christian Encyclopedia have listed Bahá'í membership as over 7 million. The Bahá'í Faith is recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity, and the only religion to have grown faster than the population of the world in all major areas over the last century.\n\nMembership data on a relatively new, worldwide religion are difficult to arrive at. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organised community, but the Bahá'í population is spread out and not in a majority anywhere. Populations are not assigned a Bahá'í religious adherence by birth, as is the case with other major religions such as Islam and Christianity. Few religious surveys include the Bahá'í Faith due to the high sample size required to reduce the margin of error, and those that have included the Bahá'í Faith are known to underestimate or overinflate many proportionally small groups. Additionally, Bahá'í membership data does not break out active participation from the total number of people who have expressed their belief.\n\nThe official claim of \"more than five million Bahá’ís\" in the world came originally in 1991 and hasn't changed since. The official agencies of the religion have focused on publishing more concrete data, such as numbers of local and national spiritual assemblies, countries and territories represented, languages and tribes represented, and publishing trusts.\n\nIn the 1930s the Bahá'ís of the United States and Canada began requiring new adherents to sign a declaration of faith, stating their belief in Bahá'u'lláh, the Báb, and `Abdu'l-Bahá, and an understanding that there are laws and institutions to obey. The original purpose of signing a declaration card was to allow followers to apply for lawful exemption from active military service. The signature of a card later became optional in Canada, but in the US is still used for records and administrative requirements. Many countries follow the pattern of the US and Canada.\n\nOther than signing a card and being acknowledged by a Spiritual Assembly, there is no initiation or requirement of attendance to remain on the official roll sheets. Members receive regular mailings unless they request not to be contacted.\n\nThe fact that the religion is diffuse and proportionally small are major barriers to demographic research by outsiders. Even in the United States, where significant resources are dedicated to gathering data, the Bahá'í Faith is often left off of religious surveys due to the high sample size required to reduce the margin of error. In some countries the Bahá'í Faith is illegal and Bahá'ís endure some degree of persecution, making it difficult for even Bahá'ís to maintain a count.\n\nAdherents.com, a website dedicated to collecting statistics on world religions, made the following comments about Bahá'í membership:\nMost denominations make no effort at all to maintain a national membership database and must rely on local churches or surveys of the general population. Local church membership rolls are often maintained poorly because there may be no need for an official membership list (Bahá'ís at least must maintain accurate voting lists) and local congregations sometimes do not provide their denomination's membership data even when asked.\n\n\n\nMany sources mentioning the number of Bahá'ís in the world are deriving their information from just a few sources, which themselves review Bahá'í sources among many censuses and surveys. When a number is estimated for a particular year, future years are estimated based on growth rates.\n\nIn 2012 the Pew Research Center published a report on the Global Religious Landscape. Bahá'ís were grouped in with the category \"Other Religions\" that included Sikhs and Zoroastrians. Pew said, \"Because of the lack of data on these faiths in many countries, the Pew Forum has not attempted to estimate the size of individual religions within this category...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the early 1960s until the late 1990s, the Baha'i population of the United States went from around 10,000 to 140,000 on official rolls, but the members with known addresses in 1998 was about half. In recent years, the United States Bahá'í community has been releasing detailed membership statistics.\n\nBahá'ís and other sources such as official government census data or other some third party organizations can vary. Sometimes the Bahá'í sourced numbers are higher and sometimes lower. And census data is sometimes criticized, as in the case of India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "158949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158949", "title": "CiteSeerX", "text": "CiteSeerX\n\nCiteSeer (originally called CiteSeer) is a public search engine and digital library for scientific and academic papers, primarily in the fields of computer and information science. CiteSeer holds a United States patent # 6289342, titled \"\"Autonomous citation indexing and literature browsing using citation context\",\" granted on September 11, 2001. Stephen R. Lawrence, C. Lee Giles, Kurt D. Bollacker are the inventors of this patent assigned to NEC Laboratories America, Inc. This patent was filed on May 20, 1998, which has its roots (Priority) to January 5, 1998. A continuation patent was also granted to the same inventors and also assigned to NEC Labs on this invention i.e. US Patent # 6738780 granted on May 18, 2004 and was filed on May 16, 2001. CiteSeer is considered as a predecessor of academic search tools such as Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search. CiteSeer-like engines and archives usually only harvest documents from publicly available websites and do not crawl publisher websites. For this reason, authors whose documents are freely available are more likely to be represented in the index.\n\nCiteSeer's goal is to improve the dissemination and access of academic and scientific literature. As a non-profit service that can be freely used by anyone, it has been considered as part of the open access movement that is attempting to change academic and scientific publishing to allow greater access to scientific literature. CiteSeer freely provided Open Archives Initiative metadata of all indexed documents and links indexed documents when possible to other sources of metadata such as DBLP and the ACM Portal. To promote open data, CiteSeer shares its data for non-commercial purposes under a Creative Commons license.\n\nThe name can be construed to have at least two explanations. As a pun, a 'sightseer' is a tourist who looks at the sights, so a 'cite seer' would be a researcher who looks at cited papers. Another is a 'seer' is a prophet and a 'cite seer' is a prophet of citations. CiteSeer changed its name to ResearchIndex at one point and then changed it back.\n\nCiteSeer was created by researchers Lee Giles, Kurt Bollacker and Steve Lawrence in 1997 while they were at the NEC Research Institute (now NEC Labs), Princeton, New Jersey, USA. CiteSeer's goal was to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the web and use autonomous citation indexing to permit querying by citation or by document, ranking them by citation impact. At one point, it was called ResearchIndex.\n\nCiteSeer became public in 1998 and had many new features unavailable in academic search engines at that time. These included:\n\nAfter NEC, in 2004 it was hosted as CiteSeer.IST on the World Wide Web at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University, and had over 700,000 documents. For enhanced access, performance and research, similar versions of CiteSeer were supported at universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Zürich and the National University of Singapore. However, these versions of CiteSeer proved difficult to maintain and are no longer available. Because CiteSeer only indexes freely available papers on the web and does not have access to publisher metadata, it returns fewer citation counts than sites, such as Google Scholar, that have publisher metadata. \nCiteSeer had not been comprehensively updated since 2005 due to limitations in its architecture design. It had a representative sampling of research documents in computer and information science but was limited in coverage because it was limited to papers that are publicly available, usually at an author's homepage, or those submitted by an author. To overcome some of these limitations, a modular and open source architecture for CiteSeer was designed - CiteSeer.\n\nCiteSeer replaced CiteSeer and all queries to CiteSeer were redirected. CiteSeer is a public search engine and digital library and repository for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on computer and information science. However, recently CiteSeer has been expanding into other scholarly domains such as economics, physics and others. Released in 2008, it was loosely based on the previous CiteSeer search engine and digital library and is built with a new open source infrastructure, SeerSuite, and new algorithms and their implementations. It was developed by researchers Dr. Isaac Councill and Dr. C. Lee Giles at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, Pennsylvania State University. It continues to support the goals outlined by CiteSeer to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the public web and to use a citation inquery by citations and ranking of documents by the impact of citations. Currently, Lee Giles, Prasenjit Mitra, Susan Gauch, Min-Yen Kan, Pradeep Teregowda, Juan Pablo Fernández Ramírez, Pucktada Treeratpituk, Jian Wu, Douglas Jordan, Steve Carman, Jack Carroll, Jim Jansen, and Shuyi Zheng are or have been actively involved in its development. Recently, a table search feature was introduced. It has been funded by the National Science Foundation, NASA, and Microsoft Research.\n\nCiteSeer continues to be rated as one of the world's top repositories and was rated number 1 in July 2010. It currently has over 6 million documents with nearly 6 million unique authors and 120 million citations.\n\nCiteSeer also shares its software, data, databases and metadata with other researchers, currently by Amazon S3 and by rsync. Its new modular open source architecture and software (available previously on SourceForge but now on GitHub) is built on Apache Solr and other Apache and open source tools which allows it to be a testbed for new algorithms in document harvesting, ranking, indexing, and information extraction.\n\nCiteSeer uses automated information extraction tools, usually built on machine learning methods such ParsCit, to extract scholarly document metadata such as title, authors, abstract, citations, etc. As such, there are sometime errors in authors and titles. Other academic search engines have similar errors.\n\nCiteSeer crawls publicly available scholarly documents primarily from author webpages and other open resources, and does not have access to publisher metadata. As such citation counts in CiteSeer are usually less than those in Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search who have access to publisher metadata.\n\nCiteSeer has nearly 1 million users worldwide based on unique IP addresses and has millions of hits daily. Annual downloads of document PDFs was nearly 200 million for 2015.\n\nCiteSeer data is regularly shared under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license with researchers worldwide and has been and is used in many experiments and competitions.\n\nThe CiteSeer model had been extended to cover academic documents in business with SmealSearch and in e-business with eBizSearch. However, these were not maintained by their sponsors. An older version of both of these could be once found at BizSeer.IST but is no longer in service.\n\nOther Seer-like search and repository systems have been built for chemistry, ChemSeer and for archaeology, ArchSeer. Another had been built for robots.txt file search, BotSeer. All of these are built on the open source tool SeerSuite, which uses the open source indexer Lucene.\n\n"}

No. 5946/212/2015 refers to a Curtea de Apel Constanța (Constanța Court of Appeal) lawsuit in which Romanian singer Alexandra Stan accused her impresario Marcel Prodan of blackmail, battery, deception and tax evasion. In June 2013, Stan and Prodan were travelling in a car on the Autostrada Soarelui (Sun Motorway) between Constanța and Valu lui Traian. They were stopped by police officers who found them fighting and Stan was taken to hospital. The singer later appeared on national television with evidence of assault visible on her face, generating media attention in Romania. Observers were generally on Stan's side.\n\nAccording to the singer, the incident occurred after she asked Prodan for her earnings; he reacted violently and asaulted her. Prodan said he had acted in self-defence after Stan hit him in his car and threatened to commit suicide. After several hearings with magistrates, Prodan received a seven-month suspended sentence for \"the crime of battery or other violence\" and was assessed damages. The court ruled Stan's other accusations were groundless and she was fined court costs, although Prodan's fines were later increased. This decision was handed down by the court on 21 December 2016.\n\nIn 2009, Alexandra Stan was discovered at a karaoke bar by Romanian producers and songwriters Marcel Prodan and Andrei Nemirschi, who offered her a record deal with their label Maan Records. That year she recorded a promotional single, \"Show Me The Way\". In 2011, Stan's single \"Mr. Saxobeat\" topped the Romanian Top 100 chart for eight consecutive weeks. The song was also commercially successful abroad, topping record charts in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Slovakia, Switzerland and Turkey. It was the first Romanian song to top the German Singles Chart since O-Zone's \"Dragostea Din Tei\" in 2004.\n\nAccording to spokesmen for the Poliţia Judeţeană Constanţa (Constanţa Country Police Department), on 16 June 2013, Stan was picked up from the Autostrada Soarelui (Sun Motorway), which connects the cities of Constanța and Valu lui Traian, at about 19:00 by Poliția Rutieră (traffic police), who saw a man and a woman fighting in a car on the shoulder of the motorway. The parties were identified as Stan and Prodan; Stan had visible evidence of physical assault (facial bruises), prompting the police to suggest she be taken to hospital and possibly file a complaint against her assailant. Stan was taken to Spitalul Clinic Judeţean de Urgenţă Constanţa (Constanța County Emergency Hospital), where she was treated and released.\n\nAfter Stan was taken to another hospital in Medgidia, she accused Prodan of physical abuse, and later filed complaints of blackmail, battery, deception and tax evasion. Stan insisted that a message that she would cancel concerts because of a traffic accident was posted by Prodan on her social media and was untrue. Prodan did not immediately respond to the accusations and could not be reached by email or telephone. According to Stan, Prodan beat her to intimidate her about demanding money, a reported €40,000 earned from her concerts. At the hospital, Stan consulted a physiologist, an ophthalmologist and a neurologist. She also appeared on national television, attracting media coverage in Romania.\n\nIn November 2014, judges from Constanța decided not to prosecute Prodan for Stan's complaint due to a lack of physical evidence; however, in June 2015 a preliminary hearing with magistrates was held. Prodan testified that he and Stan had \"more than a professional relationship\", which he planned to end. According to him, the incident began when he told Stan in his recording studio that she had sung poorly. Prodan alleged that Stan did not want to leave and he stated that he pushed her towards the exit. Prodan also stated that Stan slipped on a wet floor while trying to hit him. When describing the events in his car, Prodan said Stan began kicking him; he defended himself, slapping her when she jerked the steering wheel to the right. Prodan testified that Stan cried, said she wanted to commit suicide and opened the door to jump out of the car; he grabbed her hand and stopped. Stan, weeping during the hearing, said Prodan threw her into his car and struck her multiple times during the trip; in shock, she jerked the wheel to get out of the car. She denied their relationship extended beyond business.\n\nIn another hearing in late December 2015, Stan attended with her new boyfriend; during that hearing, the singer demanded more than €1 million in damages from Prodan. Prodan's ex-wife and Nicolae Nemirschi, the father of Prodan's songwriting and producing collaborator, Andrei Nemirschi, were also present, and they testified that the singer had an affair with Prodan, which Stan denied. Prodan's ex-wife said that their marriage ended after she placed a recording device in Prodan's car which provided evidence of his romantic relationship with Stan. On 19 February 2016, Prodan received a seven-month suspended sentence for \"the crime of battery or other violence\" and was ordered to pay Stan €193 for medical care and €10,000 in damages. The court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support the other accusations made by the singer, and it was reported in late November 2016 that Stan was assessed €500 in court costs. On appeal, her damage award from Prodan was increased to €25,000. That decision was finalised by the court on 21 December 2016.\n\nAfter Stan's recovery, Prodan sued her for using his songs in her live performances, a copyright battle she eventually won in June 2014. In February 2016, representatives of the law firm that represented Stan during her court process with Prodan filed suit against her alleging she failed to pay some fees. The judges dismissed the suit but the law firm filed an appeal of the decision.\n\nRomanian commentator Mircea Toma said, \"The [Romanian] media treat this subject in a derisory way. A woman who is beaten is subject of irony, something sensationalist and the violence itself is not condemned. [The Romanians] have an archaic, patriarchal mentality, and it would be good for her to go all the way to get justice and a good opportunity for society to debate domestic violence.\" Stan received support from her fans and death threats against Prodan were posted on her social media accounts. Prodan's former neighbours in Vișina—which he still visited at the time—were generally antagonistic to Stan, calling Prodan a \"quiet boy\" and suggesting she probably deserved the beating. In late 2013 Stan launched an anti-domestic violence campaign called \"Nu bate! Mai bine cântă!\". Her 2014 song \"Thanks for Leaving\" alludes to her recovery from the violent incident with Prodan. Gheorghe Chelu of \"Click!\" magazine associated the title of Stan's 2017 single \"9 Lives\" with the case, saying, \"no trouble has ever managed to bring her down\".\n"}
{"id": "4204352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4204352", "title": "Dedi", "text": "Dedi\n\nDjedi (also Dedi or Djedi of Djed-Sneferu) is the name of a fictional ancient Egyptian magician appearing in the fourth chapter of a story told in the legendary \"Westcar Papyrus.\" He is said to have worked wonders during the reign of king (pharaoh) Khufu (4th Dynasty).\n\nDjedi appears only in the fourth story of the \"Westcar Papyrus\" - there is no archeological or historical evidence that he existed. Nevertheless he is an object of great interest for historians and Egyptologists, since his magic tricks are connected to later cultural perceptions of the personality of king Khufu. Djedi is described as a commoner of extraordinary age, endowed with magical powers and talented in making prophecies.\n\nAccording to the \"Westcar Papyrus,\" prince Djedefhor brings up the story of Djedi. He stands before his father, king Khufu, and says: “There is only speaking of miracles which happened a long time ago, something known by past generations only. Truth and falsehood cannot be distinguished here. But there is someone under thy majesty´s own lifetime who is not known, someone who is able to make a ignoramus become wise.” Khufu asks: “What's the meaning of this, Djedefhor, my son?” Djedefhor answers: “There's a commoner named \"Djedi\", living in Djed-Sneferu. He's a simple citizen, but 110 years old, eats 500 loaves of bread, a shoulder of beef and drinks 100 jars of beer every day. He is capable of resurrecting decapitated beings. He is also said to be able to make wild lions so obedient that the animal would follow him with a cord dragging on the ground. Furthermore, this Djedi has knowledge of the number of \"Iput\" in the \"wenet\"-sanctuary of Thoth.” The pharaoh spent a good deal of time to seek for these chambers, for he planned to build something similar to his horizon. And Khufu orders: “You thyself, Djedefhor, my son, may bring him to me!”\n\nAnd so Djedefhor arranges his journey during the first month of the \"schemu\"-season and travels to Djed-Sneferu. He finds Djedi and invites the old man to the king's palace with the words: “Your condition is equal to someone who lives from aging and to someone who sleeps until dawn, free of illness and wheezing. For ‘aging’ is the time of dying, the time of the preparing the burial and the time of being buried. This is the questioning about the condition of a noble man. I have come to summon you in order of my father, justified, that you may eat from the delicacies my father gives, the food of his followers. And then he may guide you to the ancestors which are in the necropolis now.” Djedi replies: “Welcome, welcome, Djedefhor, son of the king, beloved of his father! May you be praised by your father, Khufu the justified. May he let your place be at the front of all time-honored ones. May thine \"Ka\" successfully champion all things against any enemy. May thine \"Ba\" know the ways that lead to the gateway of the mummified deceased.” Djedefhor brings Djedi to the harbor and makes a boat prepared for traveling. The old man promises to follow Djedefhor, on the condition that he may bring his books and scholars with him. Djedefhor accepts, and both men travel to Khufu's royal palace.\n\nDjedefhor enters the palace and goes immediately to his father, king Khufu. The prince says: “May thy majesty live, be blessed and being prosperous! I have brought Djedi to you!” Khufu replies: “Go and bring him to me!” Then Khufu takes place in the royal audience-hall. The Pharaoh receives Djedi with the words: “What is it, Djedi, this denying to have seen you ever before?” Djedi answers: “Oh sovereign, my lord! Only the one who is summoned is one who will come. I was summoned, and now see, oh sovereign, my lord, I have come.” The pharaoh continues: “Is it true, this talk-about that you could mend a severed head?” Djedi says: “Yes, oh sovereign, my lord. May you live, be blessed and prosperous. I know how to do that.” Khufu replies: “May a prisoner, who is jailed, be brought to me, so that his execution may be enforced.”. Djedi refuses with the words: “Not to make a human suffer, oh sovereign, my lord! May you live, be blessed and prosperous. You see, it was never allowed to do something like that on the noble flock.” Djedi chooses three animals instead - first a goose. He decapitates the goose and places her head at the eastern side of the audience hall, the body at the western side. Then Djedi utters a secret spell and the head of the goose stands up, starting to waddle. Then the body of the goose stands up and waddles, too. Both body-parts move into equal directions, then melt together. The resurrected goose now leaves the hall cackling. The same performance is done with an undefined water bird and a bull. Both animals are brought successfully back to life, too. Now the king says: “It is said that you know the number of \"Iput\" inside the \"wenet\"-sanctuary of Thoth. Now?” Djedi replies: “May you be praised, oh sovereign, my lord! I don't know their number. But I know where they can be found.” Khufu asks: “Where is it?” Djedi answers: “There is a box of scrolls, made of flint, which is stored in a room called ‘archive’ at Heliopolis.” The king orders: “Take that box!” Djedi replies: “May your highness be prosperous and blessed, I'm not the one who can bring it to you.” Khufu asks: “Who may be the one who could bring it to me?” Djedi answers: “The eldest of the three children in the womb of \"Rededjet\", he will bring it to you.” The king says: “I really wish all these things you say. Who is it, this \"Rededjet\"?” Djedi replies: “It's the wife of a \"wab\"-priest of the god Ra, lord of Sachebu. The god has adumbrated, that the eldest of the three shall worship as a high priest of Heliopolis over the whole realm.” The king's mood becomes grim after this. Djedi asks: “What is that heart of thine, oh sovereign, my lord, becoming so sad! Is it because of the children I have adumbrated? First your son, then his son and then one of them.” Khufu replies: “When will this Rededjet give birth?” Djedi says: “It will happen during the first month of the \"peret\"-season, on the fifteenth day.″ Khufu becomes indignant: “But it's when the canal-of-two-Mugilidae is cut off!? I would even work with my very own hands to enter them! And then I will visit that temple of Ra, lord of Sachebu.” And Djedi says: “Then I will make the waters at the fordable spots of the canal-of-two-Mugilidae become four cubits in height for you.” Khufu stands up and orders: “Have Djedi assigned to a place within the palace of my son Djedefhor where he shall live from now on. His daily gainings be 1000 loaves of bread, 100 jars of beer, one neat and 100 bundles of field garlic.” And all things are done as ordered.\n\nHistorians and Egyptologists such as Adolf Erman and Kurt Heinrich Sethe once thought the tales of \"Westcar Papyrus\" were mere folklore. Magical tricks that show animals being decapitated and their heads being replaced were performed as recently as a few decades ago, though today they are rarely shown because of aesthetical and ethical misgivings.\n\nModern Egyptologists like and Miriam Lichtheim deny this view and they argue that Sethe and Erman may have just failed to see the profundity of such novels. They point to multiple similar but somewhat later ancient Egyptian writings in which magicians perform very similar magic tricks and make prophecies to a king. According to Lepper and Lichtheim, their stories are obviously inspired by the tale of Djedi. Descriptive examples are the papyri \"pAthen\" and \"The prophecy of Neferti\". These novels show how popular the theme of prophesying already was during the Old Kingdom - just like in the story of the \"Westcar Papyrus.\" And they both talk about subalterns with magical powers similar to those of Djedi's. The Papyrus \"pBerlin 3023\" contains the novel \"The Eloquent Peasant\", in which the following phrase appears: “See, these are artists who create the existing anew, who even replace a severed head”, which can be interpreted as an allusion to the \"Westcar Papyrus.\" \"pBerlin 3023\" contains another reference which strengthens the idea that many ancient Egyptian novels were influenced by \"Westcar Papyrus\": column 232 contains the phrase \"sleeping until dawn\", which appears nearly word-by-word in the \"Westcar Papyrus.\" Since \"pAthen\", \"pBerlin 3023\" and \"The prophecy of Neferti\" show the same manner of speaking and equal picking up quaint phrases, Lepper and Lichtheim hold that Djedi (and the other wise men from same papyrus) must have been known to Egyptian authors for a long time.\n\n"}

{"id": "23508220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23508220", "title": "Erotes", "text": "Erotes\n\nThe Erotes () are a collective of winged gods associated with love and sexual intercourse in Greek mythology. They are part of Aphrodite's retinue. \"Erotes\" (Greek ) is the plural of \"Eros\" (\"Love, Desire\"), who as a singular deity has a more complex mythology.\n\nOther named Erotes are Anteros (\"Love Returned\"), Himeros (\"Impetuous Love\" or \"Pressing Desire\"), Hedylogos (\"Sweet-talk\"), Hymenaios (\"Bridal-Hymn\"), Hermaphroditus (\"Hermaphrodite\" or \"Effeminate\"), and Pothos (\"Desire, Longing,\" especially for one who is absent).\n\nThe Erotes became a motif of Hellenistic art, and may appear in Roman art in the alternate form of multiple Cupids or Cupids and Psyches. In the later tradition of Western art, erotes become indistinguishable from figures also known as Cupids, amorini, or amoretti.\n\nThe erotes are a group of winged gods in Classical mythology. They are associated with love and sexual desire, and form part of Aphrodite's retinue. The individual erotes are sometimes linked to particular aspects of love, and are often associated with same-sex desire. Sometimes the erotes are regarded as manifestations of a singular god, Eros.\n\nStories of the erotes' mischief or pranks were a popular theme in Hellenistic culture, particularly in the 2nd century BCE. Spells to attract or repel erotes were used, in order to induce love or the opposite. Different erotes represented various facets of love or desire, such as unrequited love (Himeros), mutual love (Anteros) or longing (Pothos).\n\nThe erotes were usually portrayed as nude, handsome, winged youths. The earliest known sculptured friezes depicting a group of erotes and winged maidens driving chariots pulled by goats, were created to decorate theatres in ancient Greece in the 2nd century BCE. The representation of erotes in such friezes became common, including erotes in hunting scenes. Due to their role in the classical mythological pantheon, the erotes' representation is sometimes purely symbolic (indicating some form of love) or they may be portrayed as individual characters. The presence of erotes in otherwise non-sexual images, such as of two women, has been interpreted to indicate a homoerotic subtext. In the cult of Aphrodite in Anatolia, iconographic images of the goddess with three erotes symbolized the three realms over which she had dominion: the Earth, sky, and water.\n\nGroups of numerous erotes are portrayed in ancient Greek and Roman art. In addition, a number of named gods have been regarded as erotes, sometimes being assigned particular associations with aspects of love.\n\nAnteros (Greek: Ἀντέρως, \"Antérōs\") was the god of requited love, literally \"love returned\" or \"counterpart love\". He punished those who scorned love and the advances of others, and was the avenger of unrequited love. Anteros was the son of Ares and Aphrodite in Greek mythology, and given to his brother Eros as a playmate because the latter was lonely. In another version, Anteros arose from mutual feelings between Poseidon and Nerites. Physically, Anteros was depicted as similar to Eros in every way, though sometimes with longer hair and butterfly wings. He has been described as armed with either a golden club or arrows of lead.\n\nOriginally, Eros was the god of love and intercourse; he was also worshiped as a fertility deity. His Roman counterpart was Cupid (desire).\n\nIn later myths, he was the son of the deities Aphrodite and Ares: it is the Eros of these later myths who is one of the erotes. Eros was associated with athleticism, with statues erected in \"gymnasia\", and \"was often regarded as the protector of homosexual love between men.\" Eros was depicted as often carrying a lyre or bow and arrow. He was also depicted accompanied by dolphins, flutes, roosters, roses, and torches.\n\nHedylogos or Hedylogus () was the god of sweet-talk and flattery. He is not mentioned in any existing literature, but he is depicted on ancient Greek vase paintings.\n\nHermaphroditus was the god of hermaphrodites and of effeminate men. He was the son of Hermes and Aphrodite. Born a remarkably handsome boy but after the water nymph Salmacis fell in love with him and she prayed to be united forever, their two forms merged into one.\n\nHimeros (Greek: \"uncontrollable desire\", Latin: \"Himerus\") represented desire and unrequited love. Himeros was identified by his carrying a \"taenia\", a colourful headband worn by athletes. He is described in Hesiod's Theogony as being born alongside Aphrodite.\n\nHymenaeus () or Hymen () was the god of weddings, marriage, and the bridal hymn.\n\nPothos (Greek: \"yearning\") was one of Aphrodite's erotes and brother to Himeros and Eros. In some versions of myth, Pothos is the son of Eros, or is portrayed as an independent aspect of him. Yet others called him son of Zephyrus and Iris. He was part of Aphrodite's retinue, and carried a vine, indicating a connection to wine or the god Dionysus. Pothos represents longing or yearning. In the temple of Aphrodite at Megara, there was a sculpture that represented Pothos together with Eros and Himeros which has been credited to Scopas. Pothos is a name for the white Asphodelus albus flower, \"used at funerals\" according to Arthur Hort's index and translation of Theophrastus (VI, 8, 3).\n\n\n\n"}

It houses the collection of industrialist Henry Clay Frick (1849–1919).\n\nHenry Frick started his substantial art collection as soon as he started amassing his fortunes. A considerable amount of his art collection is located in his former residence \"Clayton\" in Pittsburgh, which is today a part of the Frick Art & Historical Center. Another part was given by his daughter and heiress Helen to the Frick Fine Arts Building, which is on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe family did not permanently move from Pittsburgh to New York until 1905. Henry Frick initially leased the Vanderbilt house at 640 Fifth Avenue, to which he moved a substantial amount of his collection. He had his permanent residence built between 1912 and 1914 by Thomas Hastings of Carrère and Hastings. He stayed in the house until his death in 1919. He willed the house and all of its contents, including art, furniture, and decorative objects, as a public museum. His widow Adelaide Howard Childs Frick, however, retained the right of residence and continued living in the mansion with her daughter Helen. After Adelaide Frick died in 1931, the conversion of the house into a public museum started.\n\nJohn Russell Pope altered and enlarged the building in the early 1930s to adapt it to use as a public institution. It opened to the public on December 16, 1935. Various additions to the architecture and landscape architecture of the museum site have been considered over the years including the placement of a prominent magnolia garden from the 1930s. As stated by the museum announcements: \"As a result of a decision of the Board of Trustees in 1939, three magnolias were selected for the Fifth Avenue garden. The two trees on the lower tier are Saucer Magnolias (Magnolia soulangeana) and the species on the upper tier by the flagpole is a Star Magnolia (Magnolia stellata).\"\n\nFurther expansions of the museum took place in 1977 and in 2011. In 2014, the museum announced further expansion plans, but came up against community opposition because it would result in the loss of a garden. The Frick ultimately dropped those plans and is said to be considering other options.\n\nThe Frick is one of the pre-eminent small art museums in the United States, with a high-quality collection of old master paintings and fine furniture housed in nineteen galleries of varying size within the former residence. Frick had intended the mansion to become a museum eventually, and a few of the paintings are still arranged according to Frick's design. Besides its permanent collection, the Frick has always organized small, focused temporary exhibitions.\n\nThe collection features some of the best-known paintings by major European artists as well as numerous works of sculpture and porcelain. It also has 18th-century French furniture, Limoges enamel, and Oriental rugs. After Frick's death, his daughter, Helen Clay Frick, and the Board of Trustees expanded the collection: nearly half of the collection's artworks have been acquired since 1919. Although the museum cannot lend the works of art that belonged to Frick, as stipulated in his will, The Frick Collection does lend artworks and objects acquired since his death.\n\nIncluded in the collection are Jean-Honoré Fragonard's masterpiece \"The Progress of Love\", three paintings by Johannes Vermeer including \"Mistress and Maid\", two paintings by Jacob van Ruisdael including \"Quay at Amsterdam\", and Piero della Francesca's \"St. John the Evangelist\".\n\nThe Frick is known to have extraordinary temporary exhibits. When the Mauritshuis was under reconstruction, key and rare works like Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring and Fabritius’s The Goldfinch toured the United States, and was exhibited at the Frick in 2013 as opposed to other venues available in New York City.\n\nThe Frick Collection oversees the nearby Frick Art Reference Library. The collections held at the library focus on art of the Western tradition from the fourth century to the mid-twentieth century, and chiefly include information about paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints, and illuminated manuscripts. Archival materials augment its research collections. Opened in 1920, the library quickly became a prime resource for students.\n\nAccording to \"The Art Newspaper\", the Frick Collection has a typical annual attendance of 275,000 to 300,000.\n\nIn 2011, Ian Wardropper succeeded Anne Poulet, who had run the Frick Collection as director since 2003. Poulet took the position after Samuel Sachs II stepped down after running the institution for six years. Poulet was the first female director of the Frick. During her time at the Frick Collection, Poulet increased the museum’s small board of trustees, adding 10 new members. She also introduced the Director’s Circle, a group of 44 members who each give a minimum of $25,000 a year to the Frick Collection, although many have made significantly larger contributions.\n\nBy 1997, the Frick Collection had an operating budget of $10 million and an endowment of $170 million. Despite its large endowment, the institution still needs money to preserve the building.\n\nFeatured artists include:\n\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n"}
{"id": "15638948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15638948", "title": "George Pickingill", "text": "George Pickingill\n\nGeorge Pickingill (c. 1816 – 10 April 1909) was an English farm labourer who lived and worked in the village of Canewdon in the eastern English county of Essex. Widely considered to be a cunning man, or vocational folk magician, he reportedly employed magical means to offer cures for ailments and to locate lost property, although was also alleged to have threatened to place curses on people.\n\nBorn into a rural working-class family, Pickingill grew up in Hockley, Essex and was baptised into the Church of England. Working as a farm labourer, in 1856 he married Sarah Ann Bateman in Gravesend, Kent. The couple moved back to Essex, settled in Canewdon and had four children. Pickingill's wife died in 1887, and in later life he attracted limited press attention for his claim to be one of the oldest men in England. These claims also appeared in his obituaries, although were later shown to be incorrect.\n\nPickingill was brought to wider public attention in the early 1960s by the folklorist Eric Maple. As part of his research into beliefs regarding folk magic and witchcraft in nineteenth-century Essex, Maple had interviewed a number of Canewdon residents and collected their stories about Pickingill and his reputation as a cunning man. According to their accounts, Pickingill attracted visitors from around Essex seeking his magical help, for which he did not charge. They attributed to him the power to control animals, to command imps to do his bidding, and to wield power over either six or nine malevolent witches who lived in Canewdon. It was also claimed that he was able to coerce assistance and beer from local residents by threatening to place a curse upon them or their belongings. Although it has been suggested that local people were inventing claims to please Maple, many of which were based on older tales regarding the Essex cunning man James Murrell, subsequent research by historian Ronald Hutton has confirmed aspects of the folklorist's original accounts.\n\nIn the 1970s, the occultist E.W. \"Bill\" Liddell began publicising claims that secretive hereditary witch families had informed him that Pickingill was not simply a rural cunning man but that he was a major figure in the nineteenth-century esoteric community. According to Liddell's account—which has failed to receive any scholarly support—Pickingill was a member of a hereditary witch-cult, leading a Canewdon coven and forming nine other covens across southern England. Liddell claimed that Pickingill reformed the established English witch-cult by introducing new concepts from French and Danish witchcraft and from Classical sources, and that in doing so, Pickingill created the structure from which Gardnerian Wicca emerged in the 1950s. Prominent Wiccans Doreen Valiente and Lois Bourne have expressed criticism of his claims, which have also been rejected as spurious by such historians and scholars of religion as Maple, Hutton, Owen Davies, and Aidan A. Kelly.\n\nGeorge Pickingill was the son of Charles Pickingill, a labourer and blacksmith, and Susannah Cudner, a woman who also went by the name of Hannah Cudmore; the couple had married on 17 September 1813. Although he had no known birth record, according to parish records, George Pickingill was baptised on 26 May 1816 at the church in Hockley. The year of Pickingill's birth is however in question, as he made differing claims in different censuses; in the 1851 census, he claimed to be 26, meaning that his birth would have occurred \"circa\" 1825, while in the 1861 census, he claimed to be 46, which would have placed his birth c.1815. By the time of the 1901 census, he was claiming to be 95, moving his birth to c.1806; it has been suggested that he made himself appear older to ease the process of collecting parish assistance from the church. Throughout his life, Pickingill would also use a variety of different spellings of his surname on official records, including \"Pickengill\", \"Pickingale\", \"Pickengal\", \"Pettingale\", \"Pitengale\", and \"Pittengale\".\n\nIt is apparent from census data that Pickingill lived with his parents from 1816 until the 1830s, although it is not stated where he was living at the time of the 1841 census. In 1851, he was recorded as lodging in the household of David Clemens in Little Wakering, Essex, and describing himself as a farm labourer by profession. On 18 May 1856 he married Sarah Ann Bateman at St George's Church, an Anglican church in Gravesend, Kent. In that record, both Pickingill and Bateman described themselves as residing in Gravesend, and Pickingill declared that he was working as a labourer; no profession was listed for Bateman. Bateman was born c.1831 in Tillingham, Essex, as the daughter of Joseph Bateman and his wife Mary Ann Aggus; throughout married life, she identified as \"Mary Ann Pickingill\" and appeared as \"Sarah Ann Pittengale\" in her burial record.\n\nOn 22 June 1858 the couple's daughter, Martha Ann, was born in Hawkwell, Essex. By 1861 they had moved to Eastwood, Essex, where they were recorded in that year's census. Here, Pickingill described himself as an agricultural labourer. That same year, their son Charles Frederick was born. The following year, Pickingill's wife was caught stealing two pecks of potatoes, and subsequently fined ten shillings. In 1863, a second daughter, named Mary Ann, was born to the couple.\n\nAt some point in the coming four years, the Pickingill family moved to Canewdon, where another son, George, was born in 1876. The couple and their four children were then recorded in the 1871 census, where Pickingill was again listed as working as an agricultural labourer. In the 1881 census, the couple were recorded as living with two of their children, Mary Ann and George, and Pickingill was again identifying as a labourer. On 17 August 1887, a homeless man named James Taylor stole a jacket and pair of leather gloves from Pickingill. Taylor was arrested and brought to trial in Rochford on 24 August; in October, he pleaded guilty to the theft of the jacket, although not to those of the other items. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour.\n\nOn 13 September 1887 Pickingill's wife died at the age of 63 in Canewdon; her death was attributed to a disease of the liver by the certifying doctor. She was buried at Canewdon's St. Nicholas Church on 17 September. According to the 1891 census, Pickingill was still employed as an agricultural labourer, and was living in Canewdon with his married daughter Marry Ann and his granddaughter, Emily Wood. Records show that he was living in a rented cottage with an adjacent garden, and that in July 1899 the owner sold the property at auction. By 1901 he was listed as living on parish relief, with his two sons back living with him.\n\nBy this time, Pickingill was increasingly inflating his age, eventually claiming that he was 105 years old. This attracted attention from other areas, including London, and in September 1908 a journalist visited Canewdon; he arrived by automobile, the first that Pickingill had ever seen, and allowed the old man to ride in it. The journalist subsequently wrote an article about the alleged centegenerian, in which he claimed that his name was \"Frederick Pickingale\"; it is possible that Pickingill gave the false name so that no one would be able to look up the parish records and discover his real age.\nMaple described Pickingill as \"a tall, unkempt man, solitary and uncommunicative. He had very long finger-nails, and kept his money in a purse of sacking\". He also noted that he had worked as a farm labourer and that he was a widower with two sons.\n\nThe first printed account of Pickingill that described him as a cunning man appeared fifty years after his death. This was provided by the folkorist Eric Maple, who was making a systematic study of nineteenth-century traditions regarding witchcraft and magic in south-eastern Essex, and who examined the case of Canewdon in the winter of 1959–60. He had begun his enquiries by meeting with a number of elderly local residents at the home of the schoolmistress, from whom he gained a variety of tales pertaining to magical practices in the village. His initial findings were published in 1960 in the scholarly journal \"Folklore\", produced by The Folklore Society. Maple followed this article with a shorter piece written for 'Essex Countryside Magazine' (Vol.18 No.58 - November 1961). He subsequently produced a sensationalist popular history of witchcraft, \"The Dark World of Witches\" (1962), in which he repeated many of the claims regarding Pickingill. In this work, he erroneously described south-eastern Essex as the last bastion of English witchcraft beliefs, and ignored scholarly conventions in relating his information, resulting in a critical reception from folklorists; the book nevertheless was popular and sold well.\n\nMaple noted that, unusually—given his role as a cunning man—Pickingill did not charge for his services, but did receive some money from visitors, and that his recorded roles included restoring lost property and curing minor ailments, both of which were common practices amongst British cunning folk. According to one account, he cured a woman of rheumatism by transferring the ailment to her father. Maple wrote that Pickingill was known to use cursing and malevolent magic on occasion, something that the folklorist contrasted with the activities of other contemporary cunning folk that he had studied, such as James Murrell. At harvest time, Maple recorded, Pickingill was known to wander around the field threatening to bewitch farm machinery, with many farmers thus offering him beer so that he would leave them alone. He was also recorded as coercing local people to obtain water for him from the village pump by threatening to set upon them white mice, a rodent which in local folklore was associated with misfortune. Another tale that Maple recorded also associated Pickingill with white mice; according to this, a visitor travelled to the cunning man's cottage only to find him lying in bed, with the mice suckling from his nipples.\n\nPickingill was also known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was believed that when he struck a hedgerow with his stick, game animals would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten. It was also rumoured that he could do things faster than ordinary human beings, and that he could do an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing that he got his imps—his familiar spirits—to do the job for him. Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.\n\nAccording to Maple, Pickingill was sufficiently well known in Essex as an accomplished cunning man that people came to visit him from outside Canewdon in search of magical aid, sometimes \"from great distances\", including men from the Essex village of Dengie, who sought his advice in a wage dispute. Meanwhile, as Maple noted, Canewdon had developed a reputation associating it with witchcraft and magic by the end of the nineteenth century, when it was often thought of as \"The Witch Country\" and avoided by many wagoners who feared having their vehicles bewitched. This was possibly due to its relative isolation from neighbouring settlements, as it was surrounded by marshland, and the insular nature of its community. Maple recorded that in this period there was a rumour that there were either six or nine elderly women living in Canewdon who were malevolent witches and used their magic to harm others. It was believed that whilst they were not known to one another, they all owed their allegiance to a singular wizard or master of witches, and there was a rumour in the local community that Pickingill himself was this figure. It was claimed that as \"Master of Witches\", Pickingill simply had to whistle in order for these nine witches to stand by their front doors and reveal their identities, or that alternately he could \"will them\" to dance for him in the local churchyard.\n\nSubsequent researchers also travelled to Canewdon to meet with Maple's informants and confirm his account for themselves. In April 1967 Ronald Hutton visited the village where he met with elderly resident Lillian Garner, who had been one of Maple's informants. He also found an informant that Maple had not encountered, an old man named Jack Taylor, then living in a retirement home. Taylor claimed that as a young man he knew Pickingill, and that the latter had the power of horse-whispering—the magical ability to command horses to do his bidding. On the whole, Hutton found that the account of Pickingill among the local people to whom he spoke was entirely consistent with that provided by Maple. In 1977 Hutton was followed by the Gardnerian Wiccan initiate Michael Howard, who met with Garner, then eighty-seven years old. On this occasion, she recalled Pickingill being photographed with the first car to arrive in the village, and also gave Howard the original copy of a photograph of him that was in her possession. She then added the information—which she had not given to Maple or Hutton—that her own mother had talked of Pickingill leading a local coven, and that he received \"many visitors\" from \"a long way away\" who sought his magical knowledge.\n\nA different account was provided by Charles Lefebvre, an American author of the sensationalist \"Witness to Witchcraft\" (1970). Here, his use of sources was unclear, although he asserted that Pickingill had had an ageless body, was a relative of Roma people, was the last survivor of an old witch family, held Black Masses and orgies in the church yard, and was visited by \"black magicians\" from across Europe. According to Lefebvre, Pickingill was finally killed when confronted by the sign of the cross. Hutton later described these as \"fantasies\" which served to support Lefebvre's view that witchcraft should be criminalised.\n\nHowever, claims have since been made that Pickingill was not a cunning man or involved in folk magic at all. Local Canewdon historian Sylvia Webster expressed her view to Howard that tales regarding Pickingill's magical practices had been invented by the locals of Canewdon to impress Maple. Supporting this position, she highlighted that there was no evidence to suggest that Pickingill was a cunning man prior to Maple's publications. Similarly, Richard Ward argued that the contemporary obituaries and interviews conducted with Pickingill had shown no evidence of any magical activities, when such might have been expected. Ward suggested that many of the stories regarding Pickingill's magical activities were adapted from those of a genuine Essex cunning man, James Murrell. Hutton responded critically to Ward's claims, highlighting his own investigations into the local folklore and his interview with Taylor to express the view that there \"seems little doubt\" that Pickingill was a cunning man, although \"there are still questions over what sort of one he was\". At the same time, Hutton also accepted the possibility that some of the legends associated with Murrell had come to be associated with Pickingill, although stated that this seemed to be \"incapable of solid proof\". In his counter-response to Hutton, Ward accepting that Pickingill could have been associated with \"some apparent supernatural control or knowledge of horses\" as Taylor had claimed, but that this did not automatically make him a cunning man, for which there remained no contemporary historical evidence.\n\nAccording to Maple's account, in the last few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the infirmary against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.\n\nAccording to his death certificate, \"George Pettingale\" died on 10 April 1909 at the age of 103, and his cause of death was \"senile decay\" and \"cardiac failure\". He was buried at Canewdon's St Nicholas Church on 14 April; although his stated age of 103 was recorded, the vicar added a note asserting that this was erroneous, for in reality Pickingill was \"born at Hockley 1816 [and] was only in his 93rd year\".\n\nPickingill's death attracted national press attention. It was claimed in both the \"Essex Newsman\" and \"The Times\" that he was \"believed to be the oldest man in England\"; these publications recorded his age as 106. The story was also picked up by New Zealand newspaper \"The Star\", in which he was described as \"the oldest man in England\".\n\nAccording to Maple, Pickingill left \"a legacy of myth which is curiously alien to the general run of witch traditions. In all the stories told of Pickingill there is a subtle undercurrent of horror which one finds hard to pinpoint. Possibly it arises from the fact that many of those who recount the tales actually knew the man and experienced just such a quiet terror when he passed them in the village street.\"\n\nIn 1974, a writer began sending articles to Pagan newsletter \"The Wiccan\", then edited by the Gardnerian Wiccan John Score, articulating an alternative account of Pickingill's life and relation to the British occult movement. First identifying himself only as \"a well wisher\", he later began using the pseudonym Lugh, named for the Irish mythological figure. In 1977, Lugh ceased sending the articles to \"The Wiccan\" and instead began publishing them in a rival British magazine, \"The Cauldron\", edited by Michael Howard; he claimed to have switched outlets because \"The Wiccan\" had been too dominated by Gardnerian perspectives. Lugh later revealed his name to be E.W. \"Bill\" Liddell, describing himself as an Englishman born in Essex. He added that \"circa\" 1960 he had moved to Auckland, New Zealand, before later relocating to Australia, from where he wrote his articles. In a 1984 letter he noted that he was not born with the surname of Liddell but had instead adopted it later in life. Claiming that Pickingill had been the first-cousin of his paternal great-great grandfather, Liddell asserted that he had been initiated into his family's hereditary form of witchcraft in 1950, and that he had subsequently been initiated into both the Gardnerian and Alexandrian traditions of Wicca. His partner, Sylvia Tatham, had been heavily involved in the development of the Alexandrian tradition in the early 1960s, having been one of those present when its founder, Alex Sanders, was initiated into the Gardnerian tradition. In 1982, Wiccan Publications collected together and published these articles as two pamphlets: \"Old George Pickingill and the Roots of Modern Witchcraft\" and \"Medieval Witchcraft and the Freemasons\". The articles were republished in one single volume in 1994 as \"The Pickingill Papers\", edited by Liddell and Howard.\n\nLiddell's claims regarding Pickingill are self-contradictory. Liddell explained this by stating that the information contained in his articles had been passed on to him by three separate sources, all of which had decided to use him as a mouthpiece for their own claims. The first were the members of a hereditary tradition of Pagan witchcraft, while the second were the practitioners of a similar yet separate tradition of Pagan witchcraft which, Liddell alleged, had been greatly influenced by Pickingill in the nineteenth century. The third source cited by Liddell was his own experiences gained from being born into a witchcraft family and subsequently being initiated into both of the aforementioned traditions and a separate \"cunning lodge\". He claimed that most of the information that he was publishing came from \"Elders\", or older members, involved in the first two of these traditions, and that as such he could not vouch for its accuracy, going so far as to state that he doubted the veracity of much of it.\n\nNoting that these Elders themselves had very different opinions on Gardnerian Wicca, he also stated that the Elders ceased providing him with new information in the early 1980s. He stated that these various Elders had chosen him to disseminate the information because he had been involved in both hereditary witchcraft and Gardnerian Wicca and because he was based in New Zealand, thereby making it hard for anyone to trace their identities. Despite Liddell claiming that the material he was putting forward came from various sources, the historian Ronald Hutton noted that it was all presented in a \"single, dogmatic, authorial voice\", with no indication of where the different pieces of information came from. Hutton also asserted that Liddell's changing claims would be entirely consistent with a single individual making up stories and changing them as they went along.\n\nAccording to Liddell's initial 1974 claims, since the eleventh century the Pickingill family had been priests of a pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to the worship of the Horned God. In this, his claims fitted within the historical framework of the discredited witch-cult hypothesis as propagated in the works of Margaret Murray. Later he added that the \"medieval witch cult\" was influenced by the \"tenets\" of the Iron Age druids, in particular their knowledge of ley lines which were marked out by the stone circles erected in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Conflicting with these ideas, in 1998 Liddell personally informed Hutton that the witch-cult did not derive from ancient pre-Christian religion but that it instead had been founded in fifteenth-century France, emerging from a union between Christian heretics, cunning lodges, and a cult of Lucifer founded by Islamic Moors with the intent of undermining Christianity.\n\nLiddell claimed that the Pickingill family had many links to the travelling Romani population, and that Pickingill spent many of his early years in a Romani caravan. Liddell claimed that Pickingill faced persecution as a result, and that he \"set out to terrify\" the locals of Canewdon in retaliation. According to Liddell, Pickingill was trained in Romani magic, and thus in later life became \"the most famous gypsy kako in England\". Liddell also claimed that Pickingill despised Christianity and wanted to see it overthrown; to this end he collaborated with Satanists and included Satanic elements within his ritual practices, something which horrified other members of the East Anglian witch-cult. Thus, according to Liddell, Pickingill was \"England's most feared and vilified 'Satanist'\". Elsewhere, he stressed that Pickingill was not a Satanist, but rather that he had been considered such by other witches because he practised sex magic.\n\nLiddell asserted that Pickingill spent time in France, where he was initiated into a local form of the witch-cult. According to this account, upon his return to Canewdon, Pickingill was invited to lead a local coven which had been operating since the mid-fifteenth century—the \"Seven Witches of Canewdon\"—and that he continued to lead the group until disbanding it several years prior to his death. Liddell added that Pickingill proceeded to introduce many new innovations into the English witch-cult by applying concepts borrowed from the Danish and French witch-cults, namely the idea that the coven should be led by a woman. Liddell asserted that Pickingill then established nine covens in England, spread out in Essex, Norfolk, Hertfordshire, Sussex, and Hampshire; he further added that two of those covens, based in Hertfordshire and Norfolk, survived into at least the 1970s. According to Liddell, Pickingill was propagating witchcraft in a reformed, female-oriented form because the oncoming Age of Aquarius would be more receptive to this form of spirituality.\n\nIn Liddell's account, Pickingill travelled widely and joined a variety of cunning lodges, gaining access to their grimoires and libraries. According to Liddell, from the 1850s onward Pickingill began co-operating with a group of Freemasons who considered themselves to be Rosicrucians and who wanted to prove that Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism were \"siblings\" of the witch-cult. Two of these Freemasons, Hargrave Jennings and W.J. Hughan, became pupils of Pickingill, who aided them in producing a Rosicrucian Manifesto that was used in the formation of the Societas Rosicruciana in 1865. According to Liddell, Pickingill's involvement with Freemasons also led to the foundation of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1888. Liddell also asserted that Pickingill was influenced by a coven that had been founded in the early nineteenth century by a group of Cambridge University academics led by Francis Barrett and whose rituals were based largely on Classical sources.\n\nLiddell also claimed that the prominent occultist Aleister Crowley had been initiated into one of these nine covens as a young man. According to this account, Crowley had been introduced to the coven in 1899 or 1900 by his magical mentor, Allan Bennett. Liddell asserted that Crowley was subsequently ejected from the coven for his misbehaviour. As evidence for these claims, he stated that his own grandfather had been present on three occasions at which Bennett and Crowley met with Pickingill, and that he had seen a photograph in which the three figures are together. When asked to present this photograph for public scrutiny in 1977, Liddell claimed that it was \"not available\"; when independently asked again in 1983, he asserted that it had been stolen by \"interested parties\".\n\nFurther, Liddell stated that one of Pickingill's covens was the New Forest coven, a Wiccan group which Gerald Gardner—the founder of Gardnerian Wicca—claimed had initiated him in 1939. However, Liddell did later state that he was not certain whether this was true. He also asserted that Gardner later joined another of the Pickingill covens, based in Hertfordshire, through which he received \"the Second Rite of the Hereditary Craft\". Liddell stressed that this group was separate from Gardner's own Bricket Wood coven. He furthermore claimed that Gardner received the \"Third Rite\" from an East Anglian coven, with this three-degree system of initiation influencing that in Gardnerian Wicca. As a result, he stated that the structure and rituals of Gardnerian Wicca were based on those devised by Pickingill, and that \"no impartial observer could fail to see that they formed the nucleus of the rites of Wicca.\" Liddell believed that while many hereditary witches despised him, Gardner represented \"the spiritual heir of Pickingill\", because he had similarly reformed and propagated witchcraft for contemporary purposes.\n\nLiddell's claims have received a mixed response from the British Wiccan community. Score championed them in private letters to his correspondents, declaring that they proved that the Gardnerian tradition had historical origins predating Gardner. His successor as editor of \"The Wiccan\", Leonora James, was intrigued by Liddell's claims and investigated the original records pertaining to Pickingill's life; however, by the 1980s she had concluded that Liddell's claims were spurious. In her 1978 book \"Witchcraft for Tomorrow\", the Wiccan Doreen Valiente – who had been Gardner's High Priestess in the Bricket Wood coven during the 1950s—stated that she had an \"East Anglian source\" from Essex who claimed that many of Liddell's assertions were correct. In particular, the informant championed Liddell's claims that Crowley had been an initiate of one of Pickingill's covens. By the time of her 1989 book \"The Rebirth of Witchcraft\", Valiente was more sceptical of Liddell's claims, noting that any supporting evidence was \"still sadly lacking\".\n\nAnother of Gardner's High Priestesses, Lois Bourne, asserted that she was \"as sure as I can be\" that Gardner had nothing to do with any witches from Canewdon and that if they existed in the first place, then they must have belonged to a tradition distinct from Gardnerian Wicca. Privately, the Gardnerian initiate and founder of Alexandrian Wicca, Alex Sanders, rejected the claims that Liddell made. In his 2013 biography of Valiente, Jonathan Tapsell stated that the Liddell material was \"generally regarded as a hoax\", being \"a spurious history at best, or a malicious prank at worst.\" Hutton asserted that the only \"sustained champion\" of Liddell's claims has been Michael Howard, noting that he had defended such ideas in a \"limited and measured\" manner. Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White noted that in his history of the Traditional Witchcraft movement, \"Children of Cain\", Howard \"remains cautious and refrains from accepting [Liddell's claims] outright\". Howard has maintained that he keeps an \"open mind\" about Liddell's claims, noting that while no evidence has been brought forward to substantiate them, similarly he does not believe that \"any real evidence\" has been brought forth to disprove them.\n\nSupport for Liddell's story came from Cecil Williamson, founder of the Museum of Witchcraft, who claimed to have known about Pickingill through his acquaintances with both Crowley and Gardner. However, Williamson was an unreliable source, and was known to repeatedly fabricate claims regarding past events. Another figure, known only as Colonel Lawrence, also supported Liddell's story, asserting that his own great-grandmother had studied under Pickingill and thus had been introduced to Crowley; as with Williamson's, however, Lawrence's claims are unreliable, particularly as he has made the unsupported claim that his great-grandmother studied witchcraft under the American folklorist Charles Leland. Also supporting Liddell's claims was the Wiccan Ralph Harvey, who, following the publication of Liddell's material, publicly declared that in the 1950s or 1960s he had been initiated into one of Pickingill's Nine Covens, located in Storrington, Sussex. Following the publication of Liddell's claims, a number of covens appeared in both the United States and Australia claiming to be practitioners of a tradition originating with Pickingill. Liddell himself has been critical of such groups, expressing his regret that the material he published led to their formation.\n\nLiddell's claims have had a far more critical reception from scholars specialising in magic and witchcraft in British history. In 1975, Eric Maple dismissed Lugh's claims as preposterous. He believed that such tales had been fabricated by someone who had used his own book, \"The Dark World of Witches\", as a basis. Maple informed the historian James W. Baker that he believed people connected to Valiente were behind the Lugh claims, although Baker disagreed, commenting that Valiente was \"one of the most honest of commentators on the subject\" of contemporary witchcraft, and that as a result was unlikely to be involved in such duplicity. Baker described Liddell's account as \"an extravagant hoax\", with its claims constituting \"a preposterous ahistorical muddle\".\n\nHistorian Ronald Hutton also scrutinised Liddell's claims, although added that he had corresponded with Liddell \"at length and in detail\", over the course of which he had come to like him, noting that \"he has responded to often forceful criticisms with patience, modesty, and good humour\". However, Hutton highlighted that no independent witnesses have emerged to support the existence of Liddell's alleged informants, while no supporting documentation has appeared to back any of his many claims. Hutton deemed this particularly unusual, because were Liddell's claims to have been accurate, much documentary evidence could be expected to exist. Focusing on Liddell's claim that Crowley had been initiated into one of Pickingill's covens during the 1890s, Hutton noted that there is no mention of Pickingill or a witches' coven in either Crowley's published work or personal diaries, and that similarly there was no mention of either in the diaries of Bennett, who was Crowley's magical tutor during the 1890s.\n\nHutton's assessment was shared by historian Owen Davies; in his study of English cunning-folk, he described Liddell's stories as \"seductive but entirely unsubstantiated\". Instead, he maintained that Pickingill was \"a simple rural cunning-man whose small world of village affairs never crossed with that of middle-class occultists. He received a Christian burial and the idea that he was a pagan priest would probably make him turn in his grave.\" While agreeing with Maple's assessment that Pickingill was \"one of the last practising cunning-folk in the country\", Maple noted that—unlike Murrell, James Tuckett, John Wrightson, and William Brewer—Pickingill was not a \"major regional figure\" in the profession.\n\nAmerican Pagan studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly similarly rejected Liddell's claims. Kelly highlighted that whereas Liddell had claimed that Gardnerian Wicca had adopted the concept of a female coven leader from French and Scandinavian witch covens, the historical evidence clearly showed that Gardner developed the concept of a coven being led by a high priestess during the late 1950s, thus disproving Liddell's assertions. He noted that Liddell's claim that Crowley wrote Gardner's Book of Shadows \"cannot possibly be true\" because Crowley died before the Book was written. Kelly believed that either Liddell or his Elders had purposely created a \"phony history\" in order to hide the fact that Gardner had invented Wicca in its entirety in the early 1950s. Similarly, in a 2014 article about Pickingill in \"The Cauldron\", Richard Ward argued that Liddell's claims did not stand up under scrutiny, and that they had simply been made in an attempt to promote claims regarding the existence of a \"pre-Gardnerian tradition\" of witchcraft. Liddell has specifically denied any charges that he was deliberately falsifying claims to make Gardnerian Wicca appear to have an older pedigree than it really has.\n"}

The archives are named after the authors Marguerite Radclyffe Hall (1880–1943) and Edward Carpenter (1844–1929). They are housed at the London School of Economics, at Bishopsgate Library – (press cuttings), and in the British Library (Sound Archive) (oral history tapes).\n\nThese projects in partnership with the Lesbian and Gay Newsmedia Archive (LAGNA)\n\n\nThe Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE) established the \"Gay Monitoring & Archive Project\" (GMAP) to collect evidence of discrimination and police arrests from all parts of the United Kingdom. It received agency press cuttings and collected other newspaper clippings sent in by its members.\n\nGMAP later became separate from CHE and one its founders, Julian Meldrum, moved all the papers into his London flat. Its first funding was a grant made to the \"National Council for Civil Liberties\" (NCCL) from the \"Manpower Services Commission\".\nJulian, with others, set up a limited company called the \"Hall–Carpenter Memorial Archives Ltd\" and in 1983 registered as a charity. Trustees included Oliver Merrington (Chair of the archive) and Michael Mason, publisher of Capital Gay. The Albany Trust, donated its archives and press cuttings, and the NCCL provided essential meeting and working space in Southwark, with financial assistance from the \"Lyndhurst Settlement\". It also received personal donations from members of the lesbian and gay community.\n\nThe archives moved to its first rented office accommodation in Mount Pleasant, London.\n\nA major funding bid resulted in a grant of £32,000 from the Greater London Council (GLC). Part of this was to set up a Media Project to monitor television and radio broadcasts, and Lorraine Trenchard and Mark Finch were employed to run this. The archives moved to the new London Lesbian & Gay Centre (LLGC) in Cowcross Street, Farringdon (at that time the largest lesbian & gay centre in Europe). Early publications included The Gay News Index (1982); ‘Declaring an Interest’ – a projected catalogue of gay images on television in Britain, (1982–83); and A.I.D.S. through the Media (1984). Work started on indexing the “News Library” of press cuttings, the records of gay organisations and a “Pink Thesaurus” was created by volunteers.\n\nThe archives employed Margot Farnham (until 1988) to coordinate a volunteer group for an Oral History project. Thirty-five interviews were carried out using new sound recording/transcribing equipment. The tapes and transcriptions are now in the British Library Sound Archive, part of the British Library. The Oral History project culminated in two books \"Inventing Ourselves\" and \"Walking After Midnight\" (see References).\n\nAround this time Kenneth Barrow had established the “National Lesbian & Gay Survey” within HCA. This was a Mass-Observation style survey engaging the opinions of \"ordinary\" lesbians and gay men on various vital or controversial contemporary issues, anthologies from which were later published by Routledge.\n\nThe archives’ GLC funding terminated and the Lyndhurst Settlement helped with funding.\nA fundraiser was employed who wrote to around thirty charitable trusts – but none replied favourably. It looked unlikely that the London Lesbian & Gay Centre would receive funding and its closure was imminent, the Directors made a deliberate choice to try to house the Archives in a university, preferably in London.\n\nCore collections, were moved to the Archives at the London School of Economics (LSE) with the active support of the Archivist, Angela Raspin. A number of gay activists, such as Peter Tatchell and John Chesterman, donated personal collections. The HCA at LSE have continued to grow with new accessions, and have been extensively sorted and indexed by Sue Donnelly and other professional archivists in her team.\nThe Hall–Carpenter Archives Management Committee was in abeyance.\nOliver Merrington, one of the original Directors, took over as the Honorary Secretary/Treasurer, arranging meetings, dissolving the Limited Company, issuing occasional newsletters and drawing up formal agreements with the repositories. He arranged a regular donation of press cuttings from the monthly Gay Times.\n\nThe Press Cuttings Collection proved much more difficult to house, as the LSE archive had a policy of not taking newspaper cuttings, the collection remained in the LLGC building in Cowcross Street, although the early cuttings relating to the start of the AIDS epidemic were moved to the Terence Higgins Trust. The cuttings then moved to SIGMA (an organisation conducting sexual research in relation to HIV) in Brixton. A professional archivist, Mark Collins, joined the volunteer team and started a re-sort of the cuttings collection which had not been touched for a decade. With his then partner Micheal Anthony Chan arranged their transfer in 1995 to the Greenwich Lesbian and Gay Centre, in South East London.\nSimon Bradford, the librarian of the Cat Hill campus of Middlesex University was at this time creating a new Collections Room for a number of historical archives, and offered space to HCA.\n\nIn February the transfer was arranged and a formal ten-year loan agreement signed with Middlesex University.

A collection of such cards either serves as, or aids the creation of, an index for expedited lookup of information (such as a library catalog or a back-of-the-book index). This system was invented by Carl Linnaeus, around 1760.\n\nThe most common size for index cards in North America and UK is , hence the common name 3-by-5 card. Other sizes widely available include , and ISO-size A7 (). Cards are available in blank, ruled and grid styles in a variety of colors. Special divider cards with protruding tabs and a variety of cases and trays to hold the cards are also sold by stationers and office product companies. They are part of standard stationery and office supplies all around the globe.\n\nIndex cards are used for a wide range of applications and environments: in the home to record and store recipes, shopping lists, contact information and other organizational data; in business to record presentation notes, project research and notes, and contact information; in schools as flash cards or other visual aids; and in academic research to hold data such as bibliographical citations or notes. Professional book indexers used index cards in the creation of book indexes until they were replaced by indexing software in the 1980s and 1990s. An often suggested organization method for bibliographical use is to use the smaller 3-inch by 5-inch cards to record the title and citation information of works cited, while using larger cards for recording quotes or other data. Index cards are used for many events and are helpful for planning.\n\nUntil the digitization of library catalogs, which began in the 1980s, the primary tool used to locate books was the card catalog, in which every book was described on three cards, filed alphabetically under its title, author, and subject (if non-fiction). Similar catalogs were used by law firms and other entities to organize large quantities of stored documents. However, the adoption of standard cataloging protocols throughout nations with international agreements, along with the rise of the Internet and the conversion of cataloging systems to digital storage and retrieval, has made obsolescent the widespread use of index cards for cataloging.\n\nThe first early modern card index was designed by Thomas Harrison (ca 1640s). Harrison's manuscript on The Ark of Studies (Arca studiorum) was edited and improved by Vincent Placcius in his well-known handbook on excerpting methods (De arte excerpendi, 1689).\nUsing cards to create an index was the brainchild of 18th-century naturalist Carl Linnaeus, who is known as \"the father of modern taxonomy\" for his work on categorizing species. For organizing data, he needed a system for that was expandable and able to be rearranged easily; so he kept each datum on an individual sheet, and could add new sheets and reorganize simply.\n\nCard catalogs as currently known arose in the 19th century, and Melvil Dewey standardized the index cards used in library card catalogs in the 1870s.\n\nIn the late 1890s, edge-notched cards were invented, which allowed for easy sorting of data by means of a needle-like tool. These edge-notched cards were phased out in the 1980s in favor of computer databases, and they are no longer sold.\nJames Rand, Sr.'s Rand Ledger Company (founded 1898) with its Visible Ledger system, and his son James Rand, Jr.'s American Kardex dominated sales of index card filing systems worldwide through much of the 20th century. \"Kardex\" became a common noun, especially in the medical records field where \"filing a kardex\" came to mean filling out a patient record on an index card.\n\nVladimir Nabokov wrote his works on index cards, a practice mentioned in his work \"Pale Fire\".\n\n\n\n"}

He took over his father's workshop in Amsterdam in 1749 when his father accepted his duties as \"muntmeester\" (mint master). He became mint master of the Utrecht mint, and became the teacher of the medallists David van der Kellen and Hendrik Lageman.\n\nHe made a name for himself designing and striking medals for Dutch honorary societies, and kept the presses for these societies, striking medals on request and engraving the names of the prize winners himself. On his death the presses were often purchased back at great expense by the societies. The Teylers Stichting (English: Teylers Foundation) had him design a prize medal in 1778 that is still used. At 1000 guilders the manufacture of the coin stamps was costly -a consequence of the size of the medals, which matched the ambitions of the new Foundation. Another receipt in the archive of Teylers Stichting testifies to the great care Holtzhey took when sending the medals, which were \"securely packed in wool to protect them from shaking\". After Holtzhey's death the Foundation purchased the stamp press for the Teylers prize medal from the Holtzhey estate for 100 guilders.\n\nIn 1782 Holtzhey designed two medals for John Adams, one to celebrate the Dutch acknowledgement of the independence of the Thirteen colonies on April 19, 1782, and one to celebrate the trade treaty with the Netherlands on October 8, 1782.\nThe face of the medal celebrating independence is in the collection of the Teylers Museum and declares “Libera Soror,” or “A Free Sister,” and depicts the Netherlands Maiden on the left as an armed woman and the United States on the right as a Native American woman. Holland uses a staff to place a Phrygian cap upon America's head, while America holds a shield bearing thirteen stars and rests a foot upon the head of a chained lion (representing England). The reverse shows the unicorn of the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, prostrate with its horn broken against a rock cliff. The inscription reads, “Tyrannis virtute repulsa / sub Galliae auspiciis,” which translates to “Tyranny repelled by valor / under the auspices of France”,\n\nThough Adams wrote ironically to his wife Abigail of the Dutch love for medals as a method of celebrating events, he wrote very respectfully to Holtzhey himself and thanked him for his work and explanation of the designs.\n\nTogether with his father Holtzhey wrote a catalog of 73 historical medals in 1755, \"Catalogus der Medailles en Gedenkpenningen, betrekking hebbende op de voornaamste historien der vereenigde Nederlanden, Amst. 1755\", which was sadly far from complete, though it was quoted in several books on medals. Though he married twice he remained childless, and he was succeeded as mint master in Utrecht by his pupil David van der Kellen Sr., who continued his tradition of striking historical medals for anniversaries and popular events. In 1809 his collection was sold at auction for 4000 guilders.\n"}

He is the father of the late Curt \"Mr. Perfect\" Hennig, and the grandfather of Joe \"Curtis Axel\" Hennig and Amy \"Ms. Perfect\" Hennig. He worked in the American Wrestling Association, National Wrestling Alliance and World Wide Wrestling Federation, and is known by the nickname, \"The Axe\". He was called the \"Axe\" because of his signature, often finishing move of dropping a full weight elbow onto his prone opponents.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Hennig entered the American Wrestling Association (AWA) under the tutelage of Verne Gagne. He eventually found some main event success and shared a brief Tag Team Championship reign with Duke Hoffman. But in frequently losing to rougher, more experienced wrestlers, he began questioning the scientific style instilled into him by Gagne and looked toward a different approach (in kayfabe).\n\nDuring the summer of 1963, Hennig left the AWA for a stint in the Texas territories. While touring Texas, Hennig adopted a more brutal style and won the Texas Heavyweight Title. He also crossed paths with Harley Race. The two young wrestlers struck up a friendship and following their mutual commitment in Amarillo, a new tag team broke out into the Minneapolis wrestling scene. Race and Hennig branded themselves as \"Handsome\" Harley Race and \"Pretty Boy\" Larry Hennig, a cocky villainous tag team with a penchant for breaking the rules to win matches. They quickly became top contenders, and on January 30, 1965, they defeated the tandem of Dick the Bruiser and The Crusher to capture the AWA World Tag Team Championship, becoming, at the time, the youngest tag team champions ever. Race and Hennig continued to feud with the Bruiser and Crusher and other top teams for the next several years, amassing three title reigns.\n\nVerne Gagne, in particular, was a hated rival of the team and recruited many different partners to try to defeat Race and Hennig during their AWA run. Gagne and Crusher won the titles from them six months after Race and Hennig's first reign but lost them back on August 7, 1965. The team retained the titles until May 1966 when they lost to Bruiser and Crusher. They then embarked on a tour through New Zealand, Japan, and Australia where they became the first Tag Team Champions of Australia's World Championship Wrestling in June. Just before leaving to Japan, they dropped the titles to Mark Lewin and Dominic DeNucci.\n\nRace and Hennig returned to the US in fall of 1966, starting back at the bottom of the competition. As they climbed the ranks all over again, they received a title shot on January 6, 1967 and defeated Bruiser and Crusher in Chicago, Illinois. This would prove to be their final reign at AWA Tag Team Champions.\n\nOn November 1, 1967, during a tag team match in Winnipeg, Hennig was in the middle of lifting Johnny Powers as another opponent rammed into him from the front. As he dropped Powers to the mat, Hennig found that his knee had bent inward. Despite severe damage to the cartilage and tendons, he refused to go to the local hospital and instead had Race drive him 500 miles home to Minneapolis. The injury ended their last title run. The AWA allowed Harley Race to select another partner to defend the championship.\n\nIn March 1968, Hennig returned to once again wrestle alongside Race. After several years at the top of the tag team division, however, Race left in December 1968 to pursue a singles career in the National Wrestling Alliance. Hennig was immediately partnered with Lars Anderson for the next three years. In the mid-1970s, while competing in Florida, Hennig teamed for some matches with Race. 1972 had Hennig pair with \"Dirty\" Dusty Rhodes (then a heel), and in 1973, Larry worked as a singles star feuding with Verne Gagne and son Greg.\n\nHennig made a face turn on August 10, 1974 at a TV taping in Minneapolis, now sporting a full red beard and calling himself \"the Axe\" when he saved the High Flyers, Jim Brunzell and Greg Gagne, from an attack. The event had Hennig opposing his former allies, Nick Bockwinkel and Ray Stevens, and manager Bobby Heenan (who Bockwinkel and Stevens hired following their recent loss of the AWA World Tag Team title to The Crusher and Billy Robinson the previous month) as they assaulted the Flyers during an episode of \"AWA All-Star Wrestling\".\n\nDuring this time, Hennig also appeared in the independent film, \"The Wrestler\", where he faced Verne Gagne at the Cow Palace in the opening match. In 1976, Hennig formed a team with Joe LeDuc.\n\nWhen Harley Race returned to the AWA in 1984, he wrestled Hennig's son, Curt - a match that was fueled by Larry Hennig's confronting his former tag team partner at the end of the match. The following year, Curt's first major push would be alongside his father in a feud with The Road Warriors. Before Larry's retirement in 1985, however, the Hennigs won the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship.\n\nHennig also traveled to New York City to unsuccessfully challenge Bruno Sammartino for his WWF World Heavyweight Championship title.\n\nBefore pursuing a career in professional wrestling, Hennig became the Minnesota State High School Heavyweight Champion from Robbinsdale, Minnesota in 1954. He was awarded a scholarship from the University of Minnesota to wrestle and play football but had to quit due to the priorities of family and raising children. He has five children, including professional wrestler Curt Hennig. Curt died on February 10, 2003 of acute cocaine intoxication. After the highly publicized death of Chris Benoit and his son, Hennig shared a few words with \"USA Today\" regarding premature deaths in professional wrestling.\n\nPost-retirement, Hennig and his wife became owners of a real estate company in St. Cloud, Minnesota. He had sold real estate since 1957 and also worked as an auctioneer. He also dabbles in Commodity Futures, specifically CME Dairy.\n\n\n"}

He also translated 10 poems and 4 pieces of prose. The majority of Anwar's original poems are included in his collections: \"Deru Campur Debu\", \"Kerikil-Kerikil Tajam dan yang Terampas dan yang Putus\" (both 1949), and \"Tiga Menguak Takdir\" (1950). In 1956 documentarian HB Jassin compiled most of Anwar's remaining works as \"Chairil Anwar: Pelopor Angkatan 45\", and in 1970 Burton Raffel published English translations of Anwar's original works as \"The Complete Poetry and Prose of Chairil Anwar\".\n\nBorn in Medan, North Sumatra, Anwar studied at schools run by the Dutch colonial government until around 1940, when he and his mother moved to the capital, Batavia (now Jakarta). There he began immersing himself within the local literary scene. In 1942 he wrote \"Nisan\" (\"Gravestone\"), which is generally considered his first poem. He wrote extensively during the Japanese occupation (1942–1945), at times having to change his poems to avoid censorship; for instance, the title of his best-known work, \"Aku\" (\"Me\"), was temporarily known as \"Semangat\" (\"Spirit\") to avoid censorship based on themes of individuality. Anwar possessed a passionate individualism, and the line \"I want to live another thousand years\" from \"Aku\" is often quoted. As the years passed, this individualism developed into a feeling of mortality and surrender; ultimately it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify a single theme which unites all of Anwar's work. A notorious womaniser, he died at age 27; several sources suggest syphilis as the cause of his death.\n\nAfter his death Anwar was criticised for plagiarism, with several works revealed to have been uncredited translations of foreign poems. His original works, unlike poems by earlier writers, used everyday language in an unusual manner in his poetry, mixing in words from foreign languages. Anwar's poems were also multi-interpretable. As such, the criticism of his plagiarism – although extensive at the time of discovery – has not affected his legacy. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw described Anwar as \"the perfect poet\", while Raffel describes him as \"Indonesia's greatest literary figure\". The anniversary of his death, 28 April, is celebrated as National Poetry Day.\n\nThe following list is divided into five tables based on the type of works contained within. The tables are initially arranged alphabetically by title, although they are also sortable. Titles, originally in the Van Ophuijsen and Republican spelling systems, are here standardised with the Perfected Spelling System now in use in Indonesia. English translations of titles are provided underneath the original ones; Raffel's translations have been used for those in his book, while literal translations are provided for the titles of other works. Untitled works are recorded with their first words in parentheses. Years given are in the Gregorian calendar; works written between 1942 and 1945 generally used the Japanese \"kōki\" (皇紀) calendar.

He is best known for his appearances with Championship Wrestling from Florida and Georgia Championship Wrestling in the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nWalker was trained by Tony Morelli and Pat O'Connor. He debuted in 1955 under the ring name Johnny Walker.\n\nAfter debuting as a wrestler, Walker spent a good portion of his early career (approximately from the late 1950s to the 1960s) as journeyman wrestler Johnny \"Rubberman\" Walker, a mainstay of Houston promoter Paul Boesch. Boesch gave him the nickname due to his flexibility.\n\nWalker retired in 1964.\n\nWalker broke his retirement in 1967. In the early 1970s, Walker wrestled on the independent circuit in Florida under a mask as \"The Grappler\".\n\nIn 1972, Walker was semi-retired and running a gas station in Tennessee. The Georgia promoter, Paul Jones, and his booker Leo Garibaldi asked for him to return to wrestling as the masked Mr. Wrestling II. Introduced originally as the partner of the original Mr. Wrestling (Tim Woods), Walker would take his place in many instances. Eddie Graham, the owner of the NWA Florida promotion, was also a part owner of the Georgia promotion. Graham was sending talent back and forth between the two promotions, due to the promotional war which occurred in Atlanta over a dispute with Ray Gunkel's widow Ann Gunkel and her \"outlaw promotion\" All-South Wrestling Alliance.\n\nWalker as Wrestling II became an immediate top draw and legend for the territory, leading to ten reigns as the Georgia Heavyweight Champion. During Walker's time in Georgia as Wrestling II, he was considered one of the top five most popular wrestlers in the United States. He also attracted a high-profile fan in Jimmy Carter, at the time the governor of Georgia. (see below)\n\nWhile most of his career during the 1970s and 1980s was focused on the southeastern corner of the United States, he also made a prominent appearance in Mid-South Wrestling during 1983 and 1984 as the coach and mentor of a young wrestler named Terry Allen. Vignettes aired on television, hosted by either Reisor Bowden or Jim Ross, in which Wrestling II was shown away from the ring with T.A. discussing his philosophy in taking on a rising young star in the role of a \"coach\" or showing training sessions with the two. As a tag team, they also won the promotion's tag team title from Butch Reed and Jim Neidhart on December 25, 1983.\n\nSubtle seeds of resentment were planted along the way, which led to the pair splitting and feuding. Wrestling II turned his back on T.A. in a tag team match against The Midnight Express, which saw T.A. bloodied. On the following week's program, Wrestling II threw in the towel to cost T.A. the match while he was participating in the tournament for the promotion's television title, claiming that T.A. was too badly cut to continue. Wrestling II had previously won the North American Championship from the departing Junkyard Dog, which T.A. won from him in Tulsa, Oklahoma on May 13, 1984.\n\nWalker was later signed by Vince McMahon for the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, as part of McMahon's national expansion. However, as he was in the twilight of his career, Walker was mainly used as enhancement talent and rarely ever appeared on TV, only appearing a handful of times. He spent two years in the WWF before leaving in 1986.\n\nMr. Wrestling II was the director of talent relations for Hawai'i Championship Wrestling. On October 13, 2007, he came out of retirement and won the HCW Kekaulike Heritage Tag Team Championship with Mr. Wrestling 3, II's protégé.\n\nJimmy Carter, the governor of Georgia and later president of the United States during Wrestling II's 1970s heyday, considered him to be his favorite wrestler, as well as his mother's favorite. Walker was invited to Carter's inauguration, but in the end declined the invitation. The United States Secret Service insisted that Walker appear unmasked for security reasons. Due to his popularity at the time under the mask, he couldn't justify the possible ramifications of his identity being exposed. Wrestling II did, however, on several occasions enjoy a private audience with Lillian Carter. He faced scrutiny from the Secret Service on these occasions as well, but they went off without incident.\n\nWalker had two children with his wife, Olivia. She was a seamstress and costume maker. Many of her clients were country music performers including Porter Wagoner. During an interview, Ric Flair stated that many of his robes were made by her. Olivia died in October 2000.\n\n"}

It was formerly the town house (\"hôtel\") of the abbots of Cluny, started in 1334. The structure was rebuilt by Jacques d'Amboise, abbot \"in commendam\" of Cluny 1485–1510; it combines Gothic and Renaissance elements.

Although originally intended for the use of the Cluny abbots, the residence was taken over by Jacques d'Amboise, Bishop of Clermont and Abbot of Jumièges, and rebuilt to its present form in the period of 1485-1500. Occupants of the house over the years have included Mary Tudor, the sister of Henry VIII of England. She resided here in 1515 after the death of her husband Louis XII, whose successor, Francis I, kept her under surveillance, particularly to see if she was pregnant. Seventeenth-century occupants included several papal nuncios, including Mazarin.\n\nIn the 18th century, the tower of the Hôtel de Cluny was used as an observatory by the astronomer Charles Messier who, in 1771, published his observations in the landmark Messier catalog. In 1789, the \"hôtel\" was confiscated by the state, and for the next three decades served several functions. At one point, it was owned by a physician who used the magnificent Flamboyant chapel on the first floor as a dissection room.\n\nIn 1833, Alexandre du Sommerard bought the Hôtel de Cluny and installed his large collection of medieval and Renaissance objects. Upon his death in 1842, the collection was purchased by the state; the building was opened as a museum in 1843, with Sommerard's son serving as its first curator. The present-day gardens, opened in 1971, include a \"forêt de la licorne\" inspired by the tapestries.\n\nThe Hôtel de Cluny is partially constructed on the remnants of the third century Gallo-Roman baths (known as the Thermes de Cluny), famous in their own right, and which may be visited. In fact, the museum itself actually consists of two buildings: the \"frigidarium\" (\"cooling room\"), where the vestiges of the Thermes de Cluny are, and the Hôtel de Cluny itself, which houses its impressive collections.\n\nThe Musée de Cluny houses a variety of important medieval artifacts, in particular its tapestry collection, which includes the fifteenth-century tapestry cycle \"La Dame à la Licorne\".\n\nOther notable works stored there include early medieval sculptures from the seventh and eighth centuries, and works of gold, ivory, antique furnishings, stained glass, and illuminated manuscripts.\n\nHerman Melville visited Paris in 1849, and the Hôtel de Cluny evidently fired his imagination. The structure figures prominently in Chapter 41 of \"Moby-Dick,\" when Ishmael, probing Ahab's \"darker, deeper\" motives, invokes the building as a symbol of man's noble but buried psyche.\n\nIn G. K. Chesterton's \"The Man Who Was Thursday\", the narrator states (chapter 13) that the wealthy Dr. Renard's rooms \"were like the Musée de Cluny\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7188009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7188009", "title": "RICE (medicine)", "text": "RICE (medicine)\n\nRICE is a mnemonic for four elements of treatment for soft tissue injuries – an acronym for rest, ice, compression and elevation. The mnemonic was introduced by Gabe Mirkin in Sportsmedicine Book () in year 1978. However, he has since recanted his support for the regimen. On March 16, 2014, he wrote \"Coaches have used my 'RICE' guideline for decades, but now it appears that both Ice and complete Rest may delay healing, instead of helping. In a recent study, athletes were told to exercise so intensely that they developed severe muscle damage that caused extensive muscle soreness. Although cooling delayed swelling, it did not hasten recovery from this muscle damage.\"\n\nRICE is considered a first-aid treatment, rather than a cure for soft tissue injuries. The aim is to manage discomfort and internal bleeding.\n\nThere is not enough evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine the true effectiveness of RICE therapy for acute ankle sprains. Treatment decisions for ankle sprains must be made on an individual basis and relies on expert opinions and national guidelines.\n\nRest is a key component of\nrepairing the body. Without rest, continual strain is placed on the affected area that is injured, leading to increased inflammation, pain, and possible further injury. Rest is recommended during the initial 24–48 hours after an injury, but after that modified activities can be started. Additionally, some soft tissue injuries will take longer to heal without rest. There is also a risk of abnormal repair or chronic inflammation resulting from a failure to rest. In general, the period of rest should be long enough that the patient is able to use the affected limb with the majority of function restored and pain essentially gone. \n\nIce is excellent at reducing the inflammatory response and pain associated with heat generated by increased blood flow and/or blood loss. A good method is apply ice for 20 minutes of each hour. Other recommendations are an alternation of ice and no-ice for 15–20 minutes each, for a 48-hour period. To prevent localised ischemia or frostbite to the skin, it is recommended that the ice be placed within a towel or other insulating material before wrapping around the area.\n\nExceeding the recommended time for ice application may be detrimental, as it has been shown to delay healing.\n\nCompression aims to reduce the edematous swelling that results from the inflammatory process. Although some swelling is inevitable, too much swelling results in significant loss of function, excessive pain and eventual slowing of blood flow through vessel restriction.\n\nAn elastic bandage, rather than a firm plastic bandage (such as zinc-oxide tape) is required. Usage of a tight, non-elastic bandage will result in reduction of adequate blood flow, potentially causing ischemia. The fit should be snug so as to not move freely, but still allow expansion for when muscles contract and fill with blood.\n\nCompression stockings or sleeves are a viable option to manage swelling of extremities with graduated compression (where the amount of compression decreases as the distance to the heart decreases). These garments are especially effective post-operatively and are used in virtually all hospitals to manage acute or chronic swelling, such as congestive heart failure.\n\nElevation aims to reduce swelling by increasing venous return of blood to the systemic circulation. This will result in less edema which reduces pain and/or swelling.\n\nVariations of the acronym are sometimes used, to emphasize additional steps that should be taken. These include:\n\nAs the Cold or Ice component of RICE and its variations reduces blood flow to the injured area and delays healing, some people argue that for certain types of injuries (such as damage to ligaments and tendons) a protocol that increases blood flow, such as MEAT (Movement, Exercise, Analgesics and Treatments), should be used instead.\n\n"}

The painter's intention is to highlight the protection enjoyed by culture and the arts in the Spanish Netherlands under its Spanish rulers, while this protection is not available in the rebellious Protestant United Provinces in the North.\n\nThe painting falls in the genre of the gallery paintings. Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. Frans Francken the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder started the genre by creating paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s. Some gallery paintings include portraits of the owners or collectors of the art objects or artists at work. The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch and Hieronymus Janssens.\n\nA number of gallery paintings have traditionally been attributed to van Stalbemt. This includes the composition \"\" discussed here and its reduced replica of the lower right hand corner called \"\" (also in the Prado). \"\", which is similar to the paintings in the Prado, was sold at Sotheby's on 9 July 2014 as lot 57. Most art historians now appear to agree that these works should be attributed to Hieronymus Francken II as van Stalbemt's figures differ from those in these gallery paintings. The staffage in all of the gallery interiors is now seen as most probably the work of as yet unidentified figure painters. Other gallery paintings that were formerly attributed to van Stalbemt have also been re-attributed to Hieronymus Francken II. Even so, some art historians still are of the view that van Stalbemt was also active in this genre. For instance, some art historians still see the hand of van Stalbemt in one of the best known gallery pictures - \"The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet\" (collection of The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland).\n\nThere are five known versions of this composition. \nOne in the Prado Museum in Madrid, another in the Galerie Kugel in Paris in 1988; the third was recorded in Hawkins Collection of London in 1951, a fourth version, the Galerie de Jonckheere in Paris in 2002 and the fifth at the Galerie Robert Finck in Brussels on 1955 (which was auctioned at Sotheby's on 9 July 2014 lot 57, as Hieronymus Francken II).\n"}

Publication of the magazine ceased in 1984; the unexpired portion of mail subscriptions was completed by \"Rolling Stone\" sister publication \"Record\", which itself folded in 1985. \"Trouser Press\" has continued to exist in various formats.\n\nThe magazine's original scope was British bands and artists (early issues featured the slogan \"America's Only British Rock Magazine\"). Initial issues contained occasional interviews with major artists like Brian Eno and Robert Fripp and extensive record reviews. After 14 issues, the title was shortened to simply \"Trouser Press\", and it gradually transformed into a professional magazine with color covers and advertising.\nAs the 1970s music scene transformed, so did the magazine's editorial focus. From 1976 on, \"Trouser Press\" frequently centered on the growing punk movements in both London and New York. The magazine provided in-depth articles on bands such as the Sex Pistols, The Boomtown Rats, The Clash, The Damned, the Ramones, Television, and many other similar groups, long before other U.S. music publications did. In 1980, the magazine introduced \"America Underground\", a recurring column devoted to local music scenes from different areas of the country. By the early 1980s, the magazine's focus was almost exclusively on new wave, alternative rock, and underground rock from both sides of the Atlantic. Starting in 1982, flexi-discs were included with every issue, totaling 27 releases. Although the magazine seemed to be thriving, with an ever-growing circulation, editor Robbins ceased publication after the April 1984 issue (#96), citing a lack of interest in the continuing but stagnating new wave scene that left his writers with very little to say.\n\nAs a concept, \"Trouser Press\" continued to evolve after the publication of the magazine ceased. In 1983, \"The Trouser Press Guide to New Wave Records\", edited by Robbins, was published by Charles Scribner's Sons. The book was sufficiently popular for four more substantially updated editions, with varying titles and publishers, to be issued over the years, culminating in 1997's \"The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock\". This final edition featured all-new entries on over 2,000 bands and reviews of approximately 8,500 records and CDs. The contents of all five volumes are currently available on the \"Trouser Press\" website, which is updated with entries on new bands, as well as revisions/expansions of old articles, by Robbins and other writers. TrouserPress.com went online in August 2002.\n\n"}
{"id": "65627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65627", "title": "Völuspá", "text": "Völuspá\n\nVöluspá (Old Norse Vǫluspá or Vǫluspǫ́, \"Prophecy of the Völva (Seeress)\"; reconstructed Old Norse , Modern Icelandic ) is the first and best known poem of the Poetic Edda. It tells the story of the creation of the world and its coming end, related to the audience by a völva addressing Odin. It is one of the most important primary sources for the study of Norse mythology. Henry Adam Bellows proposed a 10th-century dating and authorship by a pagan Icelander with knowledge of Christianity. He also assumes the early hearers would have been very familiar with the \"story\" of the poem and not in need of an explanation.\n\nThe poem is preserved whole in the Codex Regius and Hauksbók manuscripts while parts of it are quoted in the Prose Edda. It consists of approximately 60 \"fornyrðislag\" stanzas.\n\n\"Völuspá\" is found in the Codex Regius manuscript (ca. 1270) and in Haukr Erlendsson's \"Hauksbók\" Codex (ca. 1334), and many of its stanzas are quoted or paraphrased in Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda (composed ca. 1220, oldest extant manuscript dates from ca. 1300). The order and number of the stanzas varies in these sources. Some editors and translators have further rearranged the material. The Codex Regius version is usually taken as a base for editions.\n\nThe poem starts with the völva requesting silence from \"the sons of Heimdallr\" (human beings) and asking Odin whether he wants her to recite ancient lore. She says she remembers giants born in antiquity who reared her.\n\nShe then goes on to relate a creation myth and mentions Ymir; the world was empty until the sons of Burr lifted the earth out of the sea. The Æsir then established order in the cosmos by finding places for the sun, the moon and the stars, thereby starting the cycle of day and night. A golden age ensued where the Æsir had plenty of gold and happily constructed temples and made tools. But then three mighty giant maidens came from Jötunheimr and the golden age came to an end. The Æsir then created the dwarves, of whom Mótsognir and Durinn are the mightiest.\n\nAt this point ten of the poem's stanzas are over and six stanzas ensue which contain names of dwarves. This section, sometimes called \"Dvergatal\" (\"Catalogue of Dwarves\"), is usually considered an interpolation and sometimes omitted by editors and translators.\n\nAfter the \"Dvergatal\", the creation of the first man and woman are recounted and Yggdrasill, the world-tree, is described. The seer recalls the burning of Gullveig that led to the first \"folk\" war, and what occurred in the struggle between the Æsir and Vanir. She then recalls the time Freyja was given to the giants, which is commonly interpreted as a reference to the myth of the giant builder, as told in Gylfaginning 42.\n\nThe seeress then reveals to Odin that she knows some of his own secrets, and that he sacrificed an eye in pursuit of knowledge. She tells him she knows where his eye is hidden and how he gave it up in exchange for knowledge. She asks him in several refrains if he understands, or if he would like to hear more.\n\nIn the Codex Regius version, the seeress goes on to describe the slaying of Baldr, best and fairest of the gods and the enmity of Loki, and of others. Then she prophesies the destruction of the gods where fire and flood overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight their final battles with their enemies. This is the \"fate of the gods\" - Ragnarök. She describes the summons to battle, the deaths of many of the gods and how Odin, himself, is slain by Fenrir, the great wolf. Thor, the god of thunder and sworn protector of the earth, faces Jörmungandr, the world serpent, and wins but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterward before collapsing due to the serpent's venom. Víðarr faces Fenrir and kicks his jaw open before stabbing the wolf in the heart with his spear. The god Freyr fights the giant Surtr, who wields a fiery sword that shines brighter than the sun, and Freyr falls. \n\nFinally a beautiful reborn world will rise from the ashes of death and destruction where Baldr and Höðr will live again in a new world where the earth sprouts abundance without sowing seed. The surviving Æsir reunite with Hœnir and meet together at the field of Iðavöllr, discussing Jörmungandr, great events of the past, and the runic alphabet. A final stanza describes the sudden appearance of Nidhogg the dragon, bearing corpses in his wings, before the seeress emerges from her trance.\n\n\"Völuspá\" is still one of the most discussed poems of the \"Poetic Edda\" and dates to the 10th century, the century before the Christianization of Iceland. Most scholars agree that there are Christian influences on the text, some specifically pointing out parallels with the Sibylline Prophecies. Bellows stated in 1936 that the author of \"Völuspá\" would have had knowledge of Christianity and infused it in his poem. Bellows dates the poem to the 10th century which was a transitional period between paganism and Christianity and both religions would have co-existed before Christianity was declared the official religion on Iceland and the old paganism was tolerated if practiced in private. This allowed the traditions to survive to an extent in Iceland unlike in mainland Scandinavia. Some authors have pointed out that there is religious syncretism in the text.\n\nSome have suggested that the \"Dvergatal\" section and the part where the \"Almighty who rules over all\" are later insertions to the poem. Although some have identified \"the Almighty\" (a seemingly alien concept in Norse Mythology) with Jesus, Bellows thought this was not necessarily the case.\n\n\n\n\n"}
