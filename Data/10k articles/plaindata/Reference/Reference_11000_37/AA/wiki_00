The inaugural class was announced in 1998 and the Hall was not formally organized until 2011. Prior to 2011, there were four classes: 1998–2000 and then another in 2002. The Arena Football Hall of Fame is the highest honor for players, coaches, and contributors involved in the AFL. The voting process consists of fans and current Hall of Fame members voting on the finalists. The finalists are selected by the League Office in which they collect ballots from the Arena Football Hall of Fame Advisory Board, a group which consisted of former players, executives, journalists and media personnel with a long-time involvement in the league.\n\nIn order to be nominated for the Arena Football Hall of Fame, a candidate must meet at least one of four criteria (as of 2015, depending upon whether he is being considered as a player, a coach, or a contributor). A player who has played after the 1989 season must have played a minimum of three seasons. A player must be retired for a minimum of three full seasons. A coach must have been active for a minimum of five seasons but does not need to be retired. There is no minimum number of seasons required for contributors but rather contribution to the significant advancement of the AFL.\n\nThere is currently no physical location for the Arena Football Hall of Fame. Unlike the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which recognizes the greats not only of the NFL but the history of other outdoor pro football leagues, there is not a museum associated with Arena Football, but there is, however, within the Pro Football Hall of Fame a relatively small exhibit that features the history of the Arena Football League.\n\nMuch like the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Arena Football League has a weekend dedicated to the inductees and during a selected Hall of Fame Game the inductees will partake in a Hall of Fame ceremony. This ceremony takes place prior to the game and will feature highlights as well as speeches from each of the inductees; each of the Hall of Fame Games are aired on CBS Sports Network annually.\n\nThe list is complete up to date 2014 Hall of Fame class.\n\nClass of 2019 Finalists:\n\nJoe DeLamielleure was the first Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee to ever play with an Arena Football Team; as an apparent publicity stunt, he played two games for the Charlotte Rage in the 1992 season, seven years after he had retired from professional football.\n\nKurt Warner, who played three seasons with the Iowa Barnstormers from 1995 to 1997 and was inducted into the Arena Football Hall of Fame in 2011, is the first player with substantial arena football experience to make the Pro Football Hall of Fame, as well as the first to be inducted into both halls. Warner was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\n\n"}

In 2018, the Mountain West Conference moved away from using the poll, along with three others, to determine the host site for its conference championship game in football.\n\nIn this initial paper at Princeton University, Colley states, \"The method is based on very simple statistical principles, and uses only Div. I-A wins and losses as input — margin of victory does not matter. The scheme adjusts effectively for strength of schedule, in a\nway that is free of bias toward conference, tradition, or region.\" Colley claims that his method is bias-free for estimating the ranking of a team given a particular schedule.

Typically, a user answers a set of questions about their responses to conflict and is scored accordingly.\n\nMost people develop a patterned response to conflict based on their life history and history with others. This response may fit some situations well, but may be ineffective or destructive in other circumstances. The goal is to increase people's awareness of their own patterns and bring more options and flexibility within reach. \n\nThe most widely used conflict style inventories are based on the Mouton Blake Axis which posits five styles of conflict response (see Managerial Grid Model). These include the Jay Hall Conflict Management Survey, the Thomas Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument, a standard since the 1960s, and the Kraybill Conflict Style Inventory, a more recent publication that is culturally sensitive.\n\nMore extensive personality type instruments are also useful to help understand conflict style differences. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which is based on the work of Carl Jung, and the Gilmore Fraleigh instruments fall in this category.\n\nConflict resolution teachers and trainers, mediators, organizational consultants, and human resource managers use conflict style inventories in their work to help people reflect on and improve their responses to conflict. Awareness of styles helps people recognize that they have choices in how to respond to conflict. Since each style has a preferred way of interacting with others in conflict, style awareness also can greatly assist people in meeting the needs of those they live and work with.\n\n"}
{"id": "232417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232417", "title": "Dictionary of National Biography", "text": "Dictionary of National Biography\n\nThe Dictionary of National Biography (DNB) is a standard work of reference on notable figures from British history, published from 1885. The updated Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) was published on 23 September 2004 in 60 volumes and online, with 50,113 biographical articles covering 54,922 lives.\n\nHoping to emulate national biographical collections published elsewhere in Europe, such as the \"Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie\" (1875), in 1882 the publisher George Smith (1824–1901), of Smith, Elder & Co., planned a universal dictionary that would include biographical entries on individuals from world history. He approached Leslie Stephen, then editor of the \"Cornhill Magazine\", owned by Smith, to become the editor. Stephen persuaded Smith that the work should focus only on subjects from the United Kingdom and its present and former colonies. An early working title was the \"Biographia Britannica\", the name of an earlier eighteenth-century reference work.\n\nThe first volume of the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" appeared on 1 January 1885. In May 1891 Leslie Stephen resigned and Sidney Lee, Stephen's assistant editor from the beginning of the project, succeeded him as editor. A dedicated team of sub-editors and researchers worked under Stephen and Lee, combining a variety of talents from veteran journalists to young scholars who cut their academic teeth on dictionary articles at a time when postgraduate historical research in British universities was still in its infancy. While much of the dictionary was written in-house, the \"DNB\" also relied on external contributors, who included several respected writers and scholars of the late nineteenth century. By 1900, more than 700 individuals had contributed to the work. Successive volumes appeared quarterly with complete punctuality until midsummer 1900, when the series closed with volume 63. The year of publication, the editor and the range of names in each volume is given below.\n\nSince the scope included only deceased figures, the \"DNB\" was soon extended by the issue of three supplementary volumes, covering subjects who had died between 1885 and 1900 or who had been overlooked in the original alphabetical sequence. The supplements brought the whole work up to the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901. Corrections were added.\n\nAfter issuing a volume of errata in 1904, the dictionary was reissued with minor revisions in 22 volumes in 1908 and 1909; a subtitle said that it covered British history \"from the earliest times to the year 1900\". In the words of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition\", the dictionary had \"proved of inestimable service in elucidating the private annals of the British\", providing not only concise lives of the notable deceased, but additionally lists of sources which were invaluable to researchers in a period when few libraries or collections of manuscripts had published catalogues or indices, and the production of indices to periodical literatures was just beginning. Throughout the twentieth century, further volumes were published for those who had died, generally on a decade-by-decade basis, beginning in 1912 with a supplement edited by Lee covering those who died between 1901 and 1911. The dictionary was transferred from its original publishers, Smith, Elder & Co., to Oxford University Press in 1917. Until 1996, Oxford University Press continued to add further supplements featuring articles on subjects who had died during the twentieth century.\n\nThe supplements published between 1912 and 1996 added about 6,000 lives of people who died in the twentieth century to the 29,120 in the 63 volumes of the original \"DNB\". In 1993 a volume containing missing biographies was published. This had an additional 1,000 lives, selected from over 100,000 suggestions. This did not seek to replace any articles on existing \"DNB\" subjects, even though the original work had been written from a Victorian perspective and had become out of date due to changes in historical assessments and discoveries of new information during the twentieth century. Consequently, the dictionary was becoming less and less useful as a reference work.\n\nIn 1966, the University of London published a volume of corrections, cumulated from the \"Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research\".\n\nThere were various versions of the \"Concise Dictionary of National Biography\", which covered everyone in the main work but with much shorter articles; some were only two lines. The last edition, in three volumes, covered everyone who died before 1986.\n\nIn the early 1990s Oxford University Press committed itself to overhauling the \"DNB\". Work on what was known until 2001 as the \"New Dictionary of National Biography\", or \"New DNB\", began in 1992 under the editorship of Colin Matthew, professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford. Matthew decided that no subjects from the old dictionary would be excluded, however insignificant the subjects appeared to a late twentieth-century eye; that a minority of shorter articles from the original dictionary would remain in the new version in revised form, but most would be rewritten; and that room would be made for about 14,000 new subjects. Suggestions for new subjects were solicited through questionnaires placed in libraries and universities and, as the 1990s advanced, online, and assessed by the editor, the 12 external consultant editors and several hundred associate editors and in-house staff.\n\nThe new dictionary would cover British history, \"broadly defined\" (including, for example, subjects from Roman Britain, the United States of America before its independence, and from Britain's former colonies, provided they were functionally part of the Empire and not of \"the indigenous culture\", as stated in the Introduction), up to 31 December 2000. The research project was conceived as a collaborative one, with in-house staff co-ordinating the work of nearly 10,000 contributors internationally. It would remain selective – there would be no attempt to include all members of parliament, for example – but would seek to include significant, influential or notorious figures from the whole canvas of the life of Britain and its former colonies, overlaying the decisions of the late-nineteenth-century editors with the interests of late-twentieth-century scholarship in the hope that \"the two epochs in collaboration might produce something more useful for the future than either epoch on its own\", but acknowledging also that a final definitive selection is impossible to achieve.\n\nFollowing Matthew's death in October 1999, he was succeeded as editor by another Oxford historian, Professor Brian Harrison, in January 2000. The new dictionary, now known as the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" (or \"ODNB\"), was published on 23 September 2004 in 60 volumes in print at a price of £7500, and in an online edition for subscribers. Most UK holders of a current library card can access it online free of charge. In subsequent years, the print edition has been able to be obtained new for a much lower price. At publication, the 2004 edition had 50,113 biographical articles covering 54,922 lives, including entries on all subjects included in the old \"DNB\". (The old \"DNB\" entries on these subjects may be accessed separately through a link to the \"DNB Archive\" – many of the longer entries are still highly regarded.) A small permanent staff remain in Oxford to update and extend the coverage of the online edition. Harrison was succeeded as editor by another Oxford historian, Dr Lawrence Goldman, in October 2004. The first online update was published on 4 January 2005, including subjects who had died in 2001. A further update, including subjects from all periods, followed on 23 May 2005, and another on 6 October 2005. New subjects who died in 2002 were added to the online dictionary on 5 January 2006, with continuing releases in May and October in subsequent years following the precedent of 2005. The \"ODNB\" also includes some new biographies on people who died before the \"DNB\" was published and are not included in the original \"DNB\", because they have become notable since the \"DNB\" was published through the work of more recent historians, for example William Eyre (fl. 1634–1675).\n\nThe online version has an advanced search facility, allowing a search for people by area of interest, religion and \"Places, Dates, Life Events\". This accesses an electronic index that cannot be directly viewed.\n\nResponse to the new dictionary has been for the most part positive, but in the months following publication there was occasional criticism of the dictionary in some British newspapers and periodicals for reported factual inaccuracies. However, the number of articles publicly queried in this way was small – only 23 of the 50,113 articles published in September 2004, leading to fewer than 100 substantiated factual amendments. These and other queries received since publication are being considered as part of an ongoing programme of assessing proposed corrections or additions to existing subject articles, which can, when approved, be incorporated into the online edition of the dictionary. In 2005, The American Library Association awarded the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\" its prestigious Dartmouth Medal. A general review of the dictionary was published in 2007.\n\nSir David Cannadine took over the editorship from October 2014.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2701770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2701770", "title": "Directorium Inquisitorum", "text": "Directorium Inquisitorum\n\nThe Directorium Inquisitorum is Nicholas Eymerich's most prominent and enduring work, written in Latin and consisting of approximately 800 pages, which he had composed as early as 1376. Eymerich had written an earlier treatise on sorcery, perhaps as early as 1359, which he extensively reworked into the \"Directorium Inqusitorum\" In compiling the book, Eymerich used many of the magic texts he had previously confiscated from accused sorcerers. It can also be considered as an assessment of a century and half of official Inquisition in the \"albigensian\" country.\n\nThe Dominican friar Nicholas Eymerich was appointed Inquisitor General of Aragon in 1357. As he directed much of his efforts to the apparent errors of members of the clergy, he often found his investigations blocked by the court, curia, or papacy. King Peter IV of Aragon had him removed from office at the general chapter held at Perpignan in 1360.\n\nIn lieu of being elected the Vicar General of the Dominicans in Aragon in 1362 however, Eymerich was again Inquisitor General. For a time King Peter IV of Aragon prevented Eymerich from serving as inquisitor. Finally in 1376 he drove him from the kingdom and Eymerich fled to the papal court of Pope Gregory XI in Avignon. There he wrote the \"Directorium Inquisitorum\". It was further amplified by Spanish canonist Francis Peña in 1578. According to Karen Sullivan, they viewed the accused \"as a soul deciding for itself whether it is to be united with God or forever alienated from him.\n\nEymerich appears to have been familiar with Bernard Gui's earlier \"Liber sententiarum\" and other inquisitorial treatises. The \"Directorium Inquisitorum\" includes definitions of various types of heresies, discussion of questions of jurisdiction, and proper trial procedure. The book was used as a manual for inquisitors, and gave practical advice on how to conduct inquiries. It also described various means an accused heretic might use to dissemble, such as equivocation or the pretense of insanity.\n\nWitchcraft, which was a marginal issue for early inquisitors, assumed more importance in the later edition. On the subject of magic, it discusses various types and techniques of divination and draws a distinction between practices deemed heretical and non-heretical.\n\nHe quotes Pope Innocent V in saying that in order to receive aid from a demon, a person must enter into some form of pact with the demon. Eymerich then extrapolates on this postulate to demonstrate that any agreement with a demon is a heresy. Eymerich was among the first to condemn all forms of demonic conjuration as heresy. Previously, the common belief had been that even a saint might make a demonic pact as exemplified by the story of Saint Theophilus, who made a pact with the devil to gain an ecclesiastical position.\n\nIn addition to describing common magical practices, Eymerich also described means of extracting a confession which included primitive psychological manipulation as well as outright torture. Regarding torture, Eymerich said, \"Quaestiones sunt fallaces et inefficaces\" meaning, \"Torture is deceptive and ineffectual.\" However, Eymerich was the first inquisitor to get around the Church's prohibition against torturing a subject twice. He interpreted the directive very liberally, permitting a separate instance of torture for a separate charge of heresy.\n\nThe \"Directorium Inquisitorum\" was to become the definitive handbook of procedure for the Spanish Inquisition until into the seventeenth century. It saw numerous printings, including a run at Barcelona in 1503 and one in Rome in 1578. The \"Directorium Inquisitorum\" was one of the primary forerunners of the better known \"Malleus Maleficarum\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8339", "title": "Domain Name System", "text": "Domain Name System\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.\n\nThe Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.\n\nThe Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite.\n\nThe Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy and the Internet Protocol (IP) address spaces. The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet name servers and a communication protocol implement the Domain Name System. A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.\n\nThe most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as \"responsible person\" (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating unsolicited email (spam) by storing a real-time blackhole list (RBL). The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the zone file, but other database systems are common.\n\nAn often-used analogy to explain the Domain Name System is that it serves as the phone book for the Internet by translating human-friendly computer hostnames into IP addresses. For example, the domain name www.example.com translates to the addresses 93.184.216.34 (IPv4) and 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 (IPv6). Unlike a phone book, DNS can be quickly updated, allowing a service's location on the network to change without affecting the end users, who continue to use the same hostname. Users take advantage of this when they use meaningful Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and e-mail addresses without having to know how the computer actually locates the services.\n\nAn important and ubiquitous function of DNS is its central role in distributed Internet services such as cloud services and content delivery networks. When a user accesses a distributed Internet service using a URL, the domain name of the URL is translated to the IP address of a server that is proximal to the user. The key functionality of DNS exploited here is that different users can \"simultaneously\" receive different translations for the \"same\" domain name, a key point of divergence from a traditional phone-book view of the DNS. This process of using the DNS to assign proximal servers to users is key to providing faster and more reliable responses on the Internet and is widely used by most major Internet services.\n\nThe DNS reflects the structure of administrative responsibility in the Internet. Each subdomain is a zone of administrative autonomy delegated to a manager. For zones operated by a registry, administrative information is often complemented by the registry's RDAP and WHOIS services. That data can be used to gain insight on, and track responsibility for, a given host on the Internet.\n\nUsing a simpler, more memorable name in place of a host's numerical address dates back to the ARPANET era. The Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International) maintained a text file named HOSTS.TXT that mapped host names to the numerical addresses of computers on the ARPANET. Elizabeth Feinler developed the first Resource Handbook for the ARPANET which later became the ARPANET directory. Feinler and her staff maintained the directory. Maintenance of numerical addresses, called the Assigned Numbers List, was handled by Jon Postel at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute (ISI), whose team worked closely with SRI.\n\nAddresses were assigned manually. To request a hostname and an address and add a computer to the master file, users contacted the SRI's Network Information Center (NIC), directed by Elizabeth Feinler, by telephone during business hours. Later, Feinler set up a WHOIS directory on a server in the NIC which would retrieve information about people and entities. She and her team developed the idea of domains. Feinler suggested that domains should be based on where the physical address of the computer. Computers at educational institutions would have the domain of .edu, for example. She and her team would manage the Host Naming Registry from 1972 to 1989.\n\nBy the early 1980s, maintaining a single, centralized host table had become slow and unwieldy and the emerging network required an automated naming system to address technical and personnel issues. Postel directed the task of forging a compromise between five competing proposals of solutions to Paul Mockapetris. Mockapetris instead created the Domain Name System.\n\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force published the original specifications in RFC 882 and RFC 883 in November 1983.\n\nIn 1984, four UC Berkeley students, Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riggle, and Songnian Zhou, wrote the first Unix name server implementation for the Berkeley Internet Name Domain, commonly referred to as BIND. In 1985, Kevin Dunlap of DEC substantially revised the DNS implementation. Mike Karels, Phil Almquist, and Paul Vixie have maintained BIND since then. In the early 1990s, BIND was ported to the Windows NT platform. It was widely distributed, especially on Unix systems, and is still the most widely used DNS software on the Internet.\n\nIn November 1987, RFC 1034 and RFC 1035 superseded the 1983 DNS specifications. Several additional Request for Comments have proposed extensions to the core DNS protocols.\n\nThe domain name space consists of a tree data structure. Each node or leaf in the tree has a \"label\" and zero or more \"resource records\" (RR), which hold information associated with the domain name. The domain name itself consists of the label, possibly concatenated with the name of its parent node on the right, separated by a dot.\n\nThe tree sub-divides into \"zones\" beginning at the root zone. A DNS zone may consist of only one domain, or may consist of many domains and sub-domains, depending on the administrative choices of the zone manager. DNS can also be partitioned according to \"class\" where the separate classes can be thought of as an array of parallel namespace trees.\n\nAdministrative responsibility for any zone may be divided by creating additional zones. Authority over the new zone is said to be \"delegated\" to a designated name server. The parent zone ceases to be authoritative for the new zone.\n\nThe definitive descriptions of the rules for forming domain names appear in RFC 1035, RFC 1123, and RFC 2181.\nA domain name consists of one or more parts, technically called \"labels\", that are conventionally concatenated, and delimited by dots, such as example.com.\n\nThe right-most label conveys the top-level domain; for example, the domain name www.example.com belongs to the top-level domain \"com\".\n\nThe hierarchy of domains descends from right to left; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or subdomain of the domain to the right. For example, the label \"example\" specifies a subdomain of the \"com\" domain, and \"www\" is a subdomain of example.com. This tree of subdivisions may have up to 127 levels.\n\nA label may contain zero to 63 characters. The null label, of length zero, is reserved for the root zone. The full domain name may not exceed the length of 253 characters in its textual representation. In the internal binary representation of the DNS the maximum length requires 255 octets of storage, as it also stores the length of the name.\n\nAlthough no technical limitation exists to use any character in domain name labels which are representable by an octet, hostnames use a preferred format and character set. The characters allowed in labels are a subset of the ASCII character set, consisting of characters \"a\" through \"z\", \"A\" through \"Z\", digits \"0\" through \"9\", and hyphen. This rule is known as the \"LDH rule\" (letters, digits, hyphen). Domain names are interpreted in case-independent manner. Labels may not start or end with a hyphen. An additional rule requires that top-level domain names should not be all-numeric.\n\nThe limited set of ASCII characters permitted in the DNS prevented the representation of names and words of many languages in their native alphabets or scripts. To make this possible, ICANN approved the Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) system, by which user applications, such as web browsers, map Unicode strings into the valid DNS character set using Punycode. In 2009 ICANN approved the installation of internationalized domain name country code top-level domains (\"ccTLD\"s). In addition, many registries of the existing top-level domain names (\"TLD\"s) have adopted the IDNA system.\n\nThe Domain Name System is maintained by a distributed database system, which uses the client–server model. The nodes of this database are the name servers. Each domain has at least one authoritative DNS server that publishes information about that domain and the name servers of any domains subordinate to it. The top of the hierarchy is served by the root name servers, the servers to query when looking up (\"resolving\") a TLD.\n\nAn \"authoritative\" name server is a name server that only gives answers to DNS queries from data that has been configured by an original source, for example, the domain administrator or by dynamic DNS methods, in contrast to answers obtained via a query to another name server that only maintains a cache of data.\n\nAn authoritative name server can either be a \"master\" server or a \"slave\" server. A master server is a server that stores the original (\"master\") copies of all zone records. A slave server uses a special automatic updating mechanism in the DNS protocol in communication with its master to maintain an identical copy of the master records.\n\nEvery DNS zone must be assigned a set of authoritative name servers. This set of servers is stored in the parent domain zone with name server (NS) records.\n\nAn authoritative server indicates its status of supplying definitive answers, deemed \"authoritative\", by setting a protocol flag, called the \"Authoritative Answer\" (\"AA\") bit in its responses. This flag is usually reproduced prominently in the output of DNS administration query tools, such as dig, to indicate \"that the responding name server is an authority for the domain name in question.\"\n\nDomain name resolvers determine the domain name servers responsible for the domain name in question by a sequence of queries starting with the right-most (top-level) domain label.\n\nFor proper operation of its domain name resolver, a network host is configured with an initial cache (\"hints\") of the known addresses of the root name servers. The hints are updated periodically by an administrator by retrieving a dataset from a reliable source.\n\nAssuming the resolver has no cached records to accelerate the process, the resolution process starts with a query to one of the root servers. In typical operation, the root servers do not answer directly, but respond with a referral to more authoritative servers, e.g., a query for \"www.wikipedia.org\" is referred to the \"org\" servers. The resolver now queries the servers referred to, and iteratively repeats this process until it receives an authoritative answer. The diagram illustrates this process for the host that is named by the fully qualified domain name \"www.wikipedia.org\".\n\nThis mechanism would place a large traffic burden on the root servers, if every resolution on the Internet required starting at the root. In practice caching is used in DNS servers to off-load the root servers, and as a result, root name servers actually are involved in only a relatively small fraction of all requests.\n\nIn theory, authoritative name servers are sufficient for the operation of the Internet. However, with only authoritative name servers operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the root zone of the Domain Name System and each user system would have to implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.\n\nTo improve efficiency, reduce DNS traffic across the Internet, and increase performance in end-user applications, the Domain Name System supports DNS cache servers which store DNS query results for a period of time determined in the configuration (\"time-to-live\") of the domain name record in question.\nTypically, such caching DNS servers also implement the recursive algorithm necessary to resolve a given name starting with the DNS root through to the authoritative name servers of the queried domain. With this function implemented in the name server, user applications gain efficiency in design and operation.\n\nThe combination of DNS caching and recursive functions in a name server is not mandatory; the functions can be implemented independently in servers for special purposes.\n\nInternet service providers typically provide recursive and caching name servers for their customers. In addition, many home networking routers implement DNS caches and recursors to improve efficiency in the local network.\n\nThe client side of the DNS is called a DNS resolver. A resolver is responsible for initiating and sequencing the queries that ultimately lead to a full resolution (translation) of the resource sought, e.g., translation of a domain name into an IP address. DNS resolvers are classified by a variety of query methods, such as \"recursive\", \"non-recursive\", and \"iterative\". A resolution process may use a combination of these methods.\n\nIn a \"non-recursive query\", a DNS resolver queries a DNS server that provides a record either for which the server is authoritative, or it provides a partial result without querying other servers. In case of a caching DNS resolver, the non-recursive query of its local DNS cache delivers a result and reduces the load on upstream DNS servers by caching DNS request records for a period of time after an initial response from upstream DNS servers.\n\nIn a \"recursive query\", a DNS resolver queries a single DNS server, which may in turn query other DNS servers on behalf of the requester. For example, a simple stub resolver running on a home router typically makes a recursive query to the DNS server run by the user's ISP. A recursive query is one for which the DNS server answers the query completely by querying other name servers as needed. In typical operation, a client issues a recursive query to a caching recursive DNS server, which subsequently issues non-recursive queries to determine the answer and send a single answer back to the client. The resolver, or another DNS server acting recursively on behalf of the resolver, negotiates use of recursive service using bits in the query headers. DNS servers are not required to support recursive queries.\n\nThe \"iterative query\" procedure is a process in which a DNS resolver queries a chain of one or more DNS servers. Each server refers the client to the next server in the chain, until the current server can fully resolve the request. For example, a possible resolution of www.example.com would query a global root server, then a \"com\" server, and finally an \"example.com\" server.\n\nName servers in delegations are identified by name, rather than by IP address. This means that a resolving name server must issue another DNS request to find out the IP address of the server to which it has been referred. If the name given in the delegation is a subdomain of the domain for which the delegation is being provided, there is a circular dependency.\n\nIn this case, the name server providing the delegation must also provide one or more IP addresses for the authoritative name server mentioned in the delegation. This information is called \"glue\". The delegating name server provides this glue in the form of records in the \"additional section\" of the DNS response, and provides the delegation in the \"authority section\" of the response. A glue record is a combination of the name server and IP address.\n\nFor example, if the authoritative name server for example.org is ns1.example.org, a computer trying to resolve www.example.org first resolves ns1.example.org. As ns1 is contained in example.org, this requires resolving example.org first, which presents a circular dependency. To break the dependency, the name server for the top level domain org includes glue along with the delegation for example.org. The glue records are address records that provide IP addresses for ns1.example.org. The resolver uses one or more of these IP addresses to query one of the domain's authoritative servers, which allows it to complete the DNS query.\n\nA standard practice in implementing name resolution in applications is to reduce the load on the Domain Name System servers by caching results locally, or in intermediate resolver hosts. Results obtained from a DNS request are always associated with the time to live (TTL), an expiration time after which the results must be discarded or refreshed. The TTL is set by the administrator of the authoritative DNS server. The period of validity may vary from a few seconds to days or even weeks.\n\nAs a result of this distributed caching architecture, changes to DNS records do not propagate throughout the network immediately, but require all caches to expire and to be refreshed after the TTL. RFC 1912 conveys basic rules for determining appropriate TTL values.\n\nSome resolvers may override TTL values, as the protocol supports caching for up to sixty-eight years or no caching at all. Negative caching, i.e. the caching of the fact of non-existence of a record, is determined by name servers authoritative for a zone which must include the Start of Authority (SOA) record when reporting no data of the requested type exists. The value of the \"minimum\" field of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself is used to establish the TTL for the negative answer.\n\nA reverse lookup is a query of the DNS for domain names when the IP address is known. Multiple domain names may be associated with an IP address. The DNS stores IP addresses in the form of domain names as specially formatted names in pointer (PTR) records within the infrastructure top-level domain arpa. For IPv4, the domain is in-addr.arpa. For IPv6, the reverse lookup domain is ip6.arpa. The IP address is represented as a name in reverse-ordered octet representation for IPv4, and reverse-ordered nibble representation for IPv6.\n\nWhen performing a reverse lookup, the DNS client converts the address into these formats before querying the name for a PTR record following the delegation chain as for any DNS query. For example, assuming the IPv4 address 208.80.152.2 is assigned to Wikimedia, it is represented as a DNS name in reverse order: 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa. When the DNS resolver gets a pointer (PTR) request, it begins by querying the root servers, which point to the servers of American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) for the 208.in-addr.arpa zone. ARIN's servers delegate 152.80.208.in-addr.arpa to Wikimedia to which the resolver sends another query for 2.152.80.208.in-addr.arpa, which results in an authoritative response.\n\nUsers generally do not communicate directly with a DNS resolver. Instead DNS resolution takes place transparently in applications such as web browsers, e-mail clients, and other Internet applications. When an application makes a request that requires a domain name lookup, such programs send a resolution request to the DNS resolver in the local operating system, which in turn handles the communications required.\n\nThe DNS resolver will almost invariably have a cache (see above) containing recent lookups. If the cache can provide the answer to the request, the resolver will return the value in the cache to the program that made the request. If the cache does not contain the answer, the resolver will send the request to one or more designated DNS servers. In the case of most home users, the Internet service provider to which the machine connects will usually supply this DNS server: such a user will either have configured that server's address manually or allowed DHCP to set it; however, where systems administrators have configured systems to use their own DNS servers, their DNS resolvers point to separately maintained name servers of the organization. In any event, the name server thus queried will follow the process outlined above, until it either successfully finds a result or does not. It then returns its results to the DNS resolver; assuming it has found a result, the resolver duly caches that result for future use, and hands the result back to the software which initiated the request.\n\nSome large ISPs have configured their DNS servers to violate rules, such as by disobeying TTLs, or by indicating that a domain name does not exist just because one of its name servers does not respond.\n\nSome applications, such as web browsers, maintain an internal DNS cache to avoid repeated lookups via the network. This practice can add extra difficulty when debugging DNS issues, as it obscures the history of such data. These caches typically use very short caching times – in the order of one minute.\n\nInternet Explorer represents a notable exception: versions up to IE 3.x cache DNS records for 24 hours by default. Internet Explorer 4.x and later versions (up to IE 8) decrease the default time out value to half an hour, which may be changed by modifying default configuration.\n\nGoogle Chrome triggers a specific error message for DNS issues. When the DNS server is down or broken, Google Chrome returns an error message.\nThe Domain Name System includes several other functions and features.\n\nHostnames and IP addresses are not required to match in a one-to-one relationship. Multiple hostnames may correspond to a single IP address, which is useful in virtual hosting, in which many web sites are served from a single host. Alternatively, a single hostname may resolve to many IP addresses to facilitate fault tolerance and load distribution to multiple server instances across an enterprise or the global Internet.\n\nDNS serves other purposes in addition to translating names to IP addresses. For instance, mail transfer agents use DNS to find the best mail server to deliver e-mail: An MX record provides a mapping between a domain and a mail exchanger; this can provide an additional layer of fault tolerance and load distribution.\n\nThe DNS is used for efficient storage and distribution of IP addresses of blacklisted email hosts. A common method is to place the IP address of the subject host into the sub-domain of a higher level domain name, and to resolve that name to a record that indicates a positive or a negative indication.\n\nFor example:\nE-mail servers can query blacklist.example to find out if a specific host connecting to them is in the blacklist. Many of such blacklists, either subscription-based or free of cost, are available for use by email administrators and anti-spam software.\n\nThe Sender Policy Framework and DomainKeys were designed to take advantage of another DNS record type, the TXT record, but have since been assigned specific record types.\n\nTo provide resilience in the event of computer or network failure, multiple DNS servers are usually provided for coverage of each domain. At the top level of global DNS, thirteen groups of root name servers exist, with additional \"copies\" of them distributed worldwide via anycast addressing.\n\nDynamic DNS (DDNS) updates a DNS server with a client IP address on-the-fly, for example, when moving between ISPs or mobile hot spots, or when the IP address changes administratively.\n\nThe DNS protocol uses two types of DNS messages, queries and replies, and they both have the same format. Each message consists of a header and four sections: question, answer, authority, and an additional space. A header field (\"flags\") controls the content of these four sections.\n\nThe header section contains the following fields: \"Identification\", \"Flags\", \"Number of questions\", \"Number of answers\", \"Number of authority resource records\" (RRs), and \"Number of additional RRs\". The identification field can be used to match responses with queries. The flag field consists of several sub-fields. The first is a single bit which indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). The second sub-field consists of four bits indicating the type of query, or the type of query this message is a response to. 0 is a standard query, 1 an inverse query, 2 is a server status request. A single-bit sub-field indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname. Another single-bit sub-field indicates if the client wants to send a recursive query (\"RD\"). The next single-bit sub-field indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion (\"RA\"), as not all DNS servers are configured to do this task. Another sub-field indicates if the message was truncated for some reason (\"TC\"), and a four-bit sub-field is used for error codes. The \"question\" section contains the domain name and type of record (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) being resolved. The domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label. The \"answer\" section has the resource records of the queried name. A domain name may occur in multiple records if it has multiple IP addresses associated.\n\nDNS primarily uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) on port number 53 to serve requests. DNS queries consist of a single UDP request from the client followed by a single UDP reply from the server. When the length of the answer exceeds 512 bytes and both client and server support EDNS, larger UDP packets are used. Otherwise, the query is sent again using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is also used for tasks such as zone transfers. Some resolver implementations use TCP for all queries.\n\nThe Domain Name System specifies a set of various types of resource records (RRs), which are the basic information elements of the domain name system. Each record has a type (name and number), an expiration time (time to live), a class, and type-specific data. Resource records of the same type are described as a \"resource record set\" (RRset). The order of resource records in a set, which is returned by a resolver to an application, is undefined, but often servers implement round-robin ordering to achieve load balancing. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), however, work on the complete set of resource record in canonical order.\n\nWhen sent over an Internet Protocol network, all records use the common format specified in RFC 1035:\n\n\"NAME\" is the fully qualified domain name of the node in the tree . On the wire, the name may be shortened using label compression where ends of domain names mentioned earlier in the packet can be substituted for the end of the current domain name. A free standing \"@\" is used to denote the current origin.\n\n\"TYPE\" is the record type. It indicates the format of the data and it gives a hint of its intended use. For example, the \"A\" record is used to translate from a domain name to an IPv4 address, the \"NS\" record lists which name servers can answer lookups on a DNS zone, and the \"MX\" record specifies the mail server used to handle mail for a domain specified in an e-mail address.\n\n\"RDATA\" is data of type-specific relevance, such as the IP address for address records, or the priority and hostname for MX records. Well known record types may use label compression in the RDATA field, but \"unknown\" record types must not (RFC 3597).\n\nThe \"CLASS\" of a record is set to IN (for \"Internet\") for common DNS records involving Internet hostnames, servers, or IP addresses. In addition, the classes Chaos (CH) and Hesiod (HS) exist. Each class is an independent name space with potentially different delegations of DNS zones.\n\nIn addition to resource records defined in a zone file, the domain name system also defines several request types that are used only in communication with other DNS nodes (\"on the wire\"), such as when performing zone transfers (AXFR/IXFR) or for EDNS (OPT).\n\nThe domain name system supports wildcard DNS records which specify names that start with the \"asterisk label\", '*', e.g., *.example. DNS records belonging to wildcard domain names specify rules for generating resource records within a single DNS zone by substituting whole labels with matching components of the query name, including any specified descendants. For example, in the following configuration, the DNS zone \"x.example\" specifies that all subdomains, including subdomains of subdomains, of \"x.example\" use the mail exchanger (MX) \"a.x.example\". The A record for \"a.x.example\" is needed to specify the mail exchanger IP address. As this has the result of excluding this domain name and its subdomains from the wildcard matches, an additional MX record for the subdomain \"a.x.example\", as well as a wildcarded MX record for all of its subdomains, must also be defined in the DNS zone.\n\nThe role of wildcard records was refined in RFC 4592, because the original definition in RFC 1034 was incomplete and resulted in misinterpretations by implementers.\n\nThe original DNS protocol had limited provisions for extension with new features. In 1999, Paul Vixie published in RFC 2671 (superseded by RFC 6891) an extension mechanism, called Extension mechanisms for DNS (EDNS) that introduced optional protocol elements without increasing overhead when not in use. This was accomplished through the OPT pseudo-resource record that only exists in wire transmissions of the protocol, but not in any zone files. Initial extensions were also suggested (EDNS0), such as increasing the DNS message size in UDP datagrams.\n\nDynamic DNS updates use the UPDATE DNS opcode to add or remove resource records dynamically from a zone database maintained on an authoritative DNS server. The feature is described in RFC 2136. This facility is useful to register network clients into the DNS when they boot or become otherwise available on the network. As a booting client may be assigned a different IP address each time from a DHCP server, it is not possible to provide static DNS assignments for such clients.\n\nOriginally, security concerns were not major design considerations for DNS software or any software for deployment on the early Internet, as the network was not open for participation by the general public. However, the expansion of the Internet into the commercial sector in the 1990s changed the requirements for security measures to protect data integrity and user authentication.\n\nSeveral vulnerability issues were discovered and exploited by malicious users. One such issue is DNS cache poisoning, in which data is distributed to caching resolvers under the pretense of being an authoritative origin server, thereby polluting the data store with potentially false information and long expiration times (time-to-live). Subsequently, legitimate application requests may be redirected to network hosts operated with malicious intent.\n\nDNS responses traditionally do not have a cryptographic signature, leading to many attack possibilities; the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) modify DNS to add support for cryptographically signed responses. DNSCurve has been proposed as an alternative to DNSSEC. Other extensions, such as TSIG, add support for cryptographic authentication between trusted peers and are commonly used to authorize zone transfer or dynamic update operations.\n\nSome domain names may be used to achieve spoofing effects. For example, and paypa1.com are different names, yet users may be unable to distinguish them in a graphical user interface depending on the user's chosen typeface. In many fonts the letter \"l\" and the numeral \"1\" look very similar or even identical. This problem is acute in systems that support internationalized domain names, as many character codes in ISO 10646 may appear identical on typical computer screens. This vulnerability is occasionally exploited in phishing.\n\nTechniques such as forward-confirmed reverse DNS can also be used to help validate DNS results.\n\nA device looking up a DNS record must communicate with a DNS server to do so. Considerable attention has been given to the adverse privacy implications. Even if DNS records cannot easily be read, modified or spoofed due to security extensions, a person with access to the DNS server or the traffic stream \"on the wire\" may have little difficulty in matching the IP address of the device (which often identifies the user), to the websites, email or other domains they visit, and track how often and when these records are queried, since DNS records typically expire and must be requeried regularly.\n\nDNS can also \"leak\" from otherwise secure or private connections, if attention is not paid to their configuration, and at times DNS has been used to bypass firewalls by malicious persons, and exfiltrate data, since it is often seen as innocuous.\n\nTwo main approaches are in use to counter privacy issues with DNS:\n\nThe right to use a domain name is delegated by domain name registrars which are accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or other organizations such as OpenNIC, that are charged with overseeing the name and number systems of the Internet. In addition to ICANN, each top-level domain (TLD) is maintained and serviced technically by an administrative organization, operating a registry. A \"registry\" is responsible for operating the database of names within its authoritative zone, although the term is most often used for TLDs. A \"registrant\" is a person or organization who asked for domain registration. The registry receives registration information from each domain name \"registrar\", which is authorized (accredited) to assign names in the corresponding zone and publishes the information using the WHOIS protocol. As of 2015, usage of RDAP is being considered.\n\nICANN publishes the complete list of TLDs, TLD registries, and domain name registrars. Registrant information associated with domain names is maintained in an online database accessible with the WHOIS service. For most of the more than 290 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs), the domain registries maintain the WHOIS (Registrant, name servers, expiration dates, etc.) information. For instance, DENIC, Germany NIC, holds the DE domain data. From about 2001, most Generic top-level domain (gTLD) registries have adopted this so-called \"thick\" registry approach, i.e. keeping the WHOIS data in central registries instead of registrar databases.\n\nFor top-level domains on COM and NET, a \"thin\" registry model is used. The domain registry (e.g., GoDaddy, BigRock and PDR, VeriSign, etc, etc) holds basic WHOIS data (i.e., registrar and name servers, etc.). Organizations, or registrants using ORG on the other hand, are on the Public Interest Registry exclusively.\n\nSome domain name registries, often called \"network information centers\" (NIC), also function as registrars to end-users, in addition to providing access to the WHOIS datasets. The top-level domain registries, such as for the domains COM, NET, and ORG use a registry-registrar model consisting of many domain name registrars. In this method of management, the registry only manages the domain name database and the relationship with the registrars. The \"registrants\" (users of a domain name) are customers of the registrar, in some cases through additional subcontracting of resellers.\n\nThe Domain Name System is defined by Request for Comments (RFC) documents published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (Internet standards). The following is a list of RFCs that define the DNS protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese RFCs are advisory in nature, but may provide useful information despite defining neither a standard or BCP. (RFC 1796)\n\n\nThese RFCs have an official status of Unknown, but due to their age are not clearly labeled as such.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "397114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=397114", "title": "Enûma Eliš", "text": "Enûma Eliš\n\nThe (Akkadian Cuneiform: , also spelled \"Enuma Elish\"), is the Babylonian creation myth (named after its opening words). It was recovered by Austen Henry Layard in 1849 (in fragmentary form) in the ruined Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh (Mosul, Iraq). A form of the myth was first published by George Smith in 1876; active research and further excavations led to near completion of the texts, and improved translation.\n\nThe \"Enûma Eliš\" has about a thousand lines and is recorded in Old Babylonian on seven clay tablets, each holding between 115 and 170 lines of Sumero-Akkadian cuneiform script. Most of Tablet V has never been recovered but, aside from this lacuna, the text is almost complete.\n\nThis epic is one of the most important sources for understanding the Babylonian world view. Over the seven tablets it describes the creation of the world, a battle between gods focused on supremacy of Marduk, the creation of man destined for the service of the Mesopotamian deities, and ends with a long passage praising Marduk. Its primary original purpose is unknown, although a version is known to have been used for certain festivals, there may also have been a political element to the myth, centered on the legitimization or primacy of Mesopotomia over Assyria. Some later versions replace Marduk with the Assyrian primary god Ashur.\n\nThe \"Enûma Eliš\" exists in various copies from Babylon and Assyria. The version from the Library of Ashurbanipal dates to the 7th century BCE. The composition of the text probably dates to the Bronze Age, or even earlier, to the time of Hammurabi. Some elements of the myth are attested by illustrations that date to, at least, as early as the Kassite era (roughly 18th to 16th centuries BCE).\n\nPrior to the discovery of the tablets, substantial elements of the myth had survived via the writings of Berossus, a 3rd-century BC Babylonian writer and priest of Bel (Marduk). These were preseved in Alexander Polyhistor's book on Chaldean History, which was reproduced by Eusebius in Book 1 of his \"Chronicon\". In it are described the primeval state of an abyssal darkness and water, the two primeval beings existing therein, said to be of a twofold principle. The description then relates the creation of further beings, partly human but with variants of wings, animal heads and bodies, and some with both sex organs. (Berossus states images of these are to be found at the temple of Bel in Babylon.) The text also describes a female being leading over them, named as Omoroca (Chaldean: \"Thalatth\"), and her slaying by Bel, who cut her in half, forming Heaven of one part and Earth of the other - this, Berossus claims to have been an allegory. The text also describes the beheading of a god, and the mixing of the god's blood with the Earth's soil, leading to the creation of men (people). Finally, there is also reference to Bel's creation of the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets. Berossus also gave an account of the Oannes, a sort of fish-man hybrid, who appeared from the sea and taught people all manner of knowledge, including writing, lawmaking, construction, mathematics, and agriculture; Berossus presented the account of creation in the form of a speech given by the Oannes. The neo-platonist Damascius also gave a short version of the Babylonian cosmological view, which closely matches the Enuma Elis.\n\nClay tablets containing inscriptions relating to analogues of biblical stories were discovered by A.H. Layard, Hormuzd Rassam, and George Smith in the ruins of the Palace and Library of Ashur-bani-pal (668-626 BC) during excavations at the mound of Kuyunjik, Nineveh (near Mosul) between 1848 and 1876. Smith worked through Rassam's find of ~20,000 fragments from 1852, and identified references to the kings Shalmaneser II, Tiglath-Pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and other rulers mentioned in the Bible - furthermore he discovered versions of a Babylonian deluge myth (see Gilgamesh flood myth), as well as creation myths.\n\nOn examination it became clear that the Assyrian myths were drawn from or similar to the Babylonian ones; additionally Sir Henry Rawlinson had noted similarities between Biblical accounts of creation and the geography of Babylonia - he suggested that biblical creation stories might have their origin in that area - a link was found on a tablet labeled K 63 at the British Museum's collection by Smith, as well as similar text on other tablets - Smith then began searching the collection for textual similarities between the two mythoses, and found several references to a deluge myth with an 'Izdubar' (literal translation of cuneiform for Gilgamesh). Smith's publication of his work led to an expedition to Assyria funded by the Daily Telegraph - there he found further tablets describing the deluge as well as fragmentary accounts of creation, a text on a war between good and evil 'gods', and a Fall of man myth. A second expedition by Smith brought back further creation legend fragments. By 1875 he had returned and began publishing accounts of these discoveries in the Daily Telegraph from 4 March 1875.\n\nSmith envisioned that the creation myth, including a part describing the fall of man must have originally spanned at least nine or ten tablets. He also identified tablets that in part were closer with Borusus' account. Some of Smith's early assignments, such as references to the stories of the temptation of Eve, to the Tower of Babel, and to instructions given from God to Adam and Eve, were later held to be erroneous.\n\nThe connection with the Bible stories brought a great deal of additional attention to the tablets - in addition to Smith's early scholarship on the tablets, early translation work included that done by E. Schrader, A.H. Sayce, and Jules Oppert. In 1890 P. Jensen published a translation and commentary \"Die Kosmologie der Babylonier\" , followed by an updated translation in his 1900 \"Mythen und Epen\" ; in 1895 Prof. Zimmern of Liepzig gave a translation of all known fragments, , shortly followed by a translation by Friedrich Delitzsch, as well as contributions by several other authors.\n\nIn 1898 the trustees of the British Museum ordered publication of a collation of all the Assyrian and Babylonian creation texts held by them, a work which was undertaken by L.W.King. King concluded that the creation myth as known in Nineveh was originally contained on seven tablets. This collection was published 1901 as \"\"Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets in the British Museum\" (Part XIII)\" . King published his own translations and notes in two volumes with additional material 1902 as \"The Seven Tablets of Creation, or the Babylonian and Assyrian Legends concerning the creation of the world and of mankind\". By then additional fragments of tablet six had been found, concerning the creation of man - here Marduk was found to have made man from his blood combined with bone, which brought comparison with Genesis 2:23 (\"This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man\") where the creation of woman required the use of a man's bone.\n\nNew material contributing to the fourth and sixth tablets also further corroborated other elements of Berossus' account. The seventh tablet added by King was a praise of Marduk, using around fifty titles over more than one hundred lines of cuneiform. Thus King's composition of the \"Enuma Elis\" consisted of five parts - the birth of gods, legend of Ea and Apsu, Dragon (Tiamat) myth, account of creation, and finally a hymn to Marduk using his many titles. Importantly, tablets, both Assyrian and Babylonian, when possessing colophons had the number of the tablet inscribed.\n\nFurther expeditions by German researchers uncovered further tablet fragments (specifically tablet 1, 6, and 7) during the period 1902-1914 - these works replaced Marduk with the Assyrian god Ashur; additional important sources for tablets 1 and 6, and tablet 7 were discovered by expeditions in 1924-5, and 1928-9 respectively. The Ashur texts uncovered by the Germans necessitated some corrections - it was Kingu not Marduk who was killed and whose blood made men. These discoveries were further supplemented by purchases from antiquity dealers - as a result by the mid 20th century most of the text of the work was known, with the exception of tablet 5.(Although a version of tablet 5 was recently discovered in 2011 in the Iraq museum archives) These further discoveries were complemented by a stream of publications and translations in the early 20th century.\n\nIn the 21st century the text continues to be a subject of active research, analysis, or discussion - significant publications include \"The Standard Babylonian Creation Myth Enūma Eliš\" ; \"Das Babylonische Weltschopfungsepos Enuma Elis\" , and \"Babylonian Creation Myths\" ; as well as other works.\n\nKing's set of tablets dated to no earlier than the 7th century BC, being from the library of Ashur-bani-pal at Nineveh - however King proposed that the tablets were copies of earlier Babylonian works as they glorified Marduk (of Babylon), and not the Assyrians' favored god, Ashur. He also thought sculptures found at the temple of Ninib at Nimrud depicted Marduk fighting Tiamat and so date the dragon legend to at least Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC), two centuries earlier than the date of Ashur-bani-pal's library. Legends of Tiamat and her monsters existed much earlier, as far as the Kassite ruler Agum I, ~17th C. BC.\n\nIt has been suggested that the myth, or at least the promotion of Marduk in it, dates to the ascendancy of the First Babylonian dynasty (1894-1595 BC), during the same period that Marduk became a national god. A similar promotion of Marduk is seen in the first lines of the Code of Hammurabi (c.1754 BC).\n\nNumerous copies of the tablets exist - even by 1902 fragments of four copies of the first tablet where known, as well as extracts, possibly examples of 'handwriting practice'. Tablets from the library of Ashur-bani-pal tended to be well written on fine clay, whereas the Neo-Babylonian tablets were often less well written and made, though fine examples existed. All tablets, both Assyrian and Babylonian had the text in lines, not columns, and the form of the text was generally identical between both.\n\nA tablet at the British Museum (No 93014.), known as the \"bilingual\" version of the creation legend describes a version of the creation legend that describes the creation of man, and animals (by Marduk with the aid of Aruru), as well as the creation of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, of land and plants, as well as the first houses and cities.\n\nOther variants of the creation myth can be found described in and \n\nThe epic itself does not rhyme, and has no meter - it is composed of couplets, usually written on the same line, occasionally forming quatrains. The title \"Enuma Elish\", meaning \"when on high\", is the incipit.\n\nThe tale begins before the advent of \"anything\", when only the primordial entities Apsu and Tiamat existed, co-mingled together. No other things or gods are said to exist, nor had any future destinies been foretold .. then from the mixture of Apsu and Tiamat two gods were made - Lahmu and Lahamu; next Anshar and Kishar were created. From Anshar came a firstly the god Anu, and from Anu, came Nudimmud (also known as Ea).\n\nThen these new gods disturbed Tiamat through their motions, and Apsu could not calm them. Further Tiamat found this abhorrent - Apsu called Mummu so that they might speak with Tiamat - he proposed to destroy them, but Tiamat was reticent on destroying what they had made. Mummu advised Apsu to destroy them, and he took it to do so, and embraced Mummu. The new gods heard of this and were worried - Ea however crafted a spell against Apsu's plan, and put Apsu to sleep with it.\n\nMummu sought to wake Apsu but could not - Ea took Apsu's halo and wore it himself, slew Apsu, and chained Mummu. Apsu became the dwelling place of Ea, together with his wife Damkina. Within the heart of Apsu Ea and Damkina created Marduk. Marduk exceeded Ea and the other gods in his godliness - Ea called him \"My son, the Sun!\". Anu creates four winds.\n\nOther gods then say to Tiamat - 'when your consort (Apsu) was slain you did nothing', and complain about the wind which disturbs them. Tiamat then proposed to make 'Monsters' and do battle with the other gods. She creates eleven chimeric creatures armed with weapons, and makes the god Kingu chief of the war party, and her new consort too. The 'Tablet of Destinies' is then given to Kingu, making his command unchallengeable.\n\nEa heard of Tiamat's plan to fight and avenge Apsu. He speaks to his grandfather Anshar - he tells that many gods have gone to Tiamat's cause, and that she has created eleven monstrous creatures fit for war, and made Kingu their leader, given him the 'Tablet of Destinies'. Anshar is troubled. Eventually Anshar tells Anu to go speak with Tiamat, see if he can calm her, but is too weak to face her and turns back. Anshar becomes more worried, thinking no god can or will stand against Tiamat.\n\nAfter thinking, Anshar proposes Marduk as their champion. Marduk is brought forth, and asks what god he must fight—to which Anshar replies that it is not a god but the goddess Tiamat. Marduk confidently assures the other gods that he will defeat Tiamat in short order, but presents the condition that he will be proclaimed supreme god—and be given authority over even Anshar—if he succeeds.\n\nAnshar speaks to Gaga, his advisor, who tells him to fetch Lahmu and Lahamu - tell them of Tiamat's war plans, of the eleven monsters she has created, and so on, telling also of Marduk's willingness to fight, and his demands for overlordship if he wins. Lahmu and Lahamu and other Igigi (heavenly gods) are distressed by this tale. The gods then drank together, becoming drowsy, whilst agreeing the contract with Marduk.\n\nMarduk is given a throne, and sits presiding over the other gods - the other gods honor him, agreeing to his overlordship.\n\nMarduk is given both the throne, as well as sceptre and vestments. He is given weapons, and sent to fight Tiamat - bow, quiver, mace, and bolts of lightning, together with the four winds - his body was aflame.\n\nUsing the four winds Marduk made a trap so that Tiamat could not escape - he added a whirlwind, a cyclone, and Imhullu (\"the Evil Wind\") - together the seven winds stirred up Tiamat. In his war chariot drawn by four creatures he advanced. He challenges Tiamat stating she has unrightfully made Kingu her consort, accusing her of being the source of the trouble. Tiamat becomes enraged and single combat begins.\n\nMarduk uses a net, a gift from Anu, to entrap Tiamat; Tiamat attempts to swallow Marduk, but 'the Evil Wind' enters her mouth, preventing this. With the winds swirling within her she becomes distended - Marduk then fires his arrow, hitting her heart - she is slain. The other gods attempt to flee but cannot, and Marduk captures them, breaks their weapons, and are trapped in the net. Her eleven monsters are also captured and chained; whilst Kingu is taken to Uggae (the Angel of Death) - the 'Tablet of Destinies' is taken from Kingu. Marduk then smashes Tiamat's head with the mace, whilst her blood is carried off by the North Wind.\n\nMarduk then splits Tiamat's remains in two - from one half he makes the sky - in it he made places for Anu, Enlil, and Ea.\n\nMarduk makes likenesses of the gods in the sky, creating constellations, and defines the days of the year from them. He creates night and day, and the moon also. He creates clouds, causes them to rain, and their water to make the Tigris and Euphrates. He gives the 'Tablet of Destinies' to Anu.\n\nStatues of the eleven monsters of Tiamat are made and installed at the gate of Apsu\n\nMarduk then speaks to Ea - saying he will use his blood to create man - and that man will serve the gods. Ea advises one of the gods be chosen as a sacrifice - the Igigi advice that Kingu be chosen - his blood is then used to create man.\n\nMarduk then divides the gods into \"above\" and \"below\" - three hundred are placed in the heavens, and six hundred on earth. The gods then propose that they should build a throne or shrine for him - Marduk tells them to construct Babylon. The gods then spend a year making bricks - they build the Esagila (Temple to Marduk) to a great height, making it a place for Marduk, Ea, and Enlil.\n\nA banquet is then held, with fifty of the great gods taking seats. Anu praises Enlil's bow, then Marduk is praised.\n\nThe first nine names or titles of Marduk are given.\n\nThe remainder of Marduk's fifty names or titles are read.\n\nTablets Smith examined also contained attributions on the rear of the tablet - the first tablet contained eight lines of a colophon - Smith's reconstruction and translation of this states : \n\nThe \"Enuma Elis\" is the primary source for Mesopotamian cosmology. According to Heidel its main purpose was as a praise of Marduk, and was important in making that Babylonian god head of the entire pantheon, through his deeds in defeating Tiamat, and in creation of the universe. Heidel also considers the text to have a political as well as religious message - that is - the promotion to primacy of a Babylonian god to better justify any Babylonian influence over the whole Mesopotamian region. The text as a whole contains many words which are Sumerian in origin, including the names of Tiamat's monsters, Marduk's wind, and the name for man used is the Sumerian \"lullu\"; however the chief god in the epic is the Babylonian Marduk, and not the Sumerian Enlil.\n\nA ritual text from the Seleucid period states that the \"Enuma Elis\" was recited during the Akitu festival. The purpose of the reading, if it occurred, and even the identity of the said text to be used as this festival is a matter of debate amongst scholars. Most analysists considered that the festival concerned and included some form of re-enactment of Tiamat's defeat by Marduk, representing a renewal cycle and or triumph over chaos, however a more detailed analysis by Jonathan Z. Smith led him to argue that the described ritual should be understood in terms of its post-Assyrian and post-Babylonian imperial temporal context, and may include an elements of psychological and political theater addressing the non-native origin of the Seleucid rulers who then controlled the area; he also questions whether the \"Enuma Elis\" read during that period was the same as that known to the ancient Assyrians. Whether the \"Enuma Elis\" creation myth was created for the Akitu ritual, or \"vice versa\", or neither, is unclear; nevertheless there are definite connections in subject matter between the myth and festival, and there is also evidence of the festival as celebrated during the neo-Babylonian period that correlates well with the \"Enuma Elis\" myth. A version of the \"Enuma Elis\" is also thought to have been read during the month of Kislimu.\n\nIt has been suggested that ritual reading of the poem coincided with spring flooding of the Tigris or Euphrates in following the melting of snow in mountainous regions upstream - this interpretation is supported by the defeat of the (watery being) Tiamat by Marduk.\n\nThe \"Enuma Elis\" contains numerous parallels with the Old Testament, and has led to a general conclusion amongst some researchers that the paralleled Old Testament stories were based on the mesopotamian work. Overarching similarities include : reference to a watery chaos before creation; a separation of the chaos into heaven and earth; different types of waters and their separation during the creation process; as well as the indirect textual similarity between the number of tablets, and the number of days of creation - that is - seven. However, in a deeper analysis notes many differences, including polytheism vs. monotheism, and personification of forces or properties in the Babylonian myth vs. imperative creation by god in the biblical stories; permanence of matter vs. creation out of nothing; and the lack of any real parallel for the extended description of Marduk's battles with monsters. He also notes some broad commonalities with other religions in both e.g. a \"watery chaos\" found in Egyptian, Phoenician, and Vedic works; and that the linguistic analysis of both belief system's texts are complicated by a common Semitic root for both languages. In terms of creation of man there are similarities in terms of the use of dust or earth (clay) for his creation, but man's purpose is inverted in the two texts - in the Enuma Elis man is created as a servant of gods, whereas in Genesis man is given more agency - nevertheless in both man contains \"godhood\" - either through a god's blood in the Babylonia, or being made \"in His own Image\" in Genesis; in both man is the final creative act of the god/gods. In terms of the seven tablets and seven days of each system - the numbered itineraries in general do not closely match - but there are some broad commonalities in order of occurrence i.e. creation event; theme of darkness; light created; firmament created; dry land created; man created; followed by god/god's inactivity.\n\nDifferent theories have been proposed to explain the similarities. Based on an analysis of proper names in the texts A.T. Clay proposed that the Enuma Elish was a combination of a Semitic myth from Amurru and a Sumerian myth from Eridu - this theory is thought to lack solidity, and specifically any historical or archaeological evidence. An alternative theory is a westward migration of the Mesopotamian myth, being known to other cultures such as the Hebrews, and so influencing their own beliefs; additionally the Hebrews specifically would expect to be influenced during their exposure to Mesopotamian culture during their Babylonian captivity. A third explanation supposes a common ancestor for both sets of belief.\n\nConrad Hyers of the Princeton Theological Seminary suggests that the Genesis creation myth polemically addressed earlier Babylonian and other creation myths to \"repudiate the divinization of nature and the attendant myths of divine origins, divine conflict, and divine ascent,\" thus rejecting the idea that Genesis borrowed from or appropriated the form of the Enûma Eliš. According to this theory, the Enûma Eliš was comfortable using connections between the divine and inert matter, while the aim of Genesis was to state the superiority of the Hebrew God Yahweh Elohim over all creation (and subsequent deities).\n\nReconstruction of the broken Enûma Eliš tablet seems to define the rarely attested \"Sapattu\" or \"Sabattu\" as the full moon. This word is cognate or merged with Hebrew \"Shabbat\" (cf. ), but is monthly rather than weekly; it is regarded as a form of Sumerian \"sa-bat\" (\"mid-rest\"), attested in Akkadian as \"um nuh libbi\" (\"day of mid-repose\"). This conclusion is a contextual restoration of the damaged tablet, which is read as \"[Sa]bbath shalt thou then encounter, mid[month]ly.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "102036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102036", "title": "Giorgio Vasari", "text": "Giorgio Vasari\n\nGiorgio Vasari (; 30 July 1511 – 27 June 1574) was an Italian painter, architect, writer, and historian, most famous today for his \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\", considered the ideological foundation of art-historical writing.\n\nVasari was born on 30 July 1511 in Arezzo, Tuscany. Recommended at an early age by his cousin Luca Signorelli, he became a pupil of Guglielmo da Marsiglia, a skillful painter of stained glass. Sent to Florence at the age of sixteen by Cardinal Silvio Passerini, he joined the circle of Andrea del Sarto and his pupils Rosso Fiorentino and Jacopo Pontormo, where his humanist education was encouraged. He was befriended by Michelangelo, whose painting style would influence his own. He died on 27 June 1574 in Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, at aged 62.\n\nIn 1529, he visited Rome where he studied the works of Raphael and other artists of the Roman High Renaissance. Vasari's own Mannerist paintings were more admired in his lifetime than afterwards. In 1547 he completed the hall of the chancery in Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome with frescoes that received the name Sala dei Cento Giorni. He was consistently employed by members of the Medici family in Florence and Rome, and worked in Naples (for example on the Vasari Sacristy), Arezzo and other places. Many of his pictures still exist, the most important being the wall and ceiling paintings in the Sala di Cosimo I in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, where he and his assistants were at work from 1555, and the frescoes begun by him inside the vast cupola of the Duomo were completed by Federico Zuccari and with the help of Giovanni Balducci. He also helped to organize the decoration of the Studiolo, now reassembled in the Palazzo Vecchio.\n\nAmong his other pupils or followers are included Sebastiano Flori, Bartolomeo Carducci, Domenico Benci, Tommaso del Verrocchio, Federigo di Lamberto (Federigo del Padovano), Niccolo Betti, Vittor Casini, Mirabello Cavalori (Salincorno), Jacopo Coppi (Jacopo di Meglio), Piero di Ridolfo, Stefano Veltroni of Monte San Savino, Orazio Porta of Monte San Savino, Alessandro Fortori of Arezzo, Bastiano Flori of Arezzo, Fra Salvatore Foschi of Arezzo, and Andrea Aretino.\n\nAside from his career as a painter, Vasari was also successful as an architect. His loggia of the Palazzo degli Uffizi by the Arno opens up the vista at the far end of its long narrow courtyard. It is a unique piece of urban planning that functions as a public piazza, and which, if considered as a short street, is unique as a Renaissance street with a unified architectural treatment. The view of the Loggia from the Arno reveals that, with the Vasari Corridor, it is one of very few structures that line the river which are open to the river itself and appear to embrace the riverside environment.\nIn Florence, Vasari also built the long passage, now called Vasari Corridor, which connects the Uffizi with the Palazzo Pitti on the other side of the river. The enclosed corridor passes alongside the River Arno on an arcade, crosses the Ponte Vecchio and winds around the exterior of several buildings. It was once the home of the Mercado de Vecchio.\n\nHe also renovated the medieval churches of Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce. At both he removed the original rood screen and loft, and remodelled the retro-choirs in the Mannerist taste of his time. In Santa Croce, he was responsible for the painting of \"The Adoration of the Magi\" which was commissioned by Pope Pius V in 1566 and completed in February 1567. It was recently restored, before being put on exhibition in 2011 in Rome and in Naples. Eventually it is planned to return it to the church of Santa Croce in Bosco Marengo (Province of Alessandria, Piedmont).\n\nIn 1562 Vasari built the octagonal dome on the Basilica of Our Lady of Humility in Pistoia, an important example of high Renaissance architecture.\n\nIn Rome, Vasari worked with Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola and Bartolomeo Ammanati at Pope Julius III's Villa Giulia.\n\nOften called \"the first art historian\", Vasari invented the genre of the encyclopedia of artistic biographies with his \"Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori\" (\"Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\"), dedicated to Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, which was first published in 1550. He was the first to use the term \"Renaissance\" (\"rinascita\") in print, though an awareness of the ongoing \"rebirth\" in the arts had been in the air since the time of Alberti, and he was responsible for our use of the term Gothic Art, though he only used the word Goth which he associated with the \"barbaric\" German style. The \"Lives\" also included a novel treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts. The book was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568, with the addition of woodcut portraits of artists (some conjectural).\n\nThe work has a consistent and notorious bias in favour of Florentines, and tends to attribute to them all the developments in Renaissance art – for example, the invention of engraving. Venetian art in particular (along with arts from other parts of Europe), is systematically ignored in the first edition. Between the first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and while the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including Titian), it did so without achieving a neutral point of view. There are also many inaccuracies within his \"Lives\". For example, Vasari writes that Andrea del Castagno killed Domenico Veneziano, which is not true, given Andrea died several years before Domenico.\n\nVasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, while others are inventions or generic fictions, such as the tale of young Giotto painting a fly on the surface of a painting by Cimabue that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter Apelles. He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and those of the immediate past. Modern criticism – with new materials opened up by research – has corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions.\n\nVasari includes a sketch of his own biography at the end of the \"Lives\", and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and Francesco Salviati.\n\nAccording to the historian Richard Goldthwaite, Vasari was one of the earliest authors to use the term \"competition\" (or \"concorrenza\" in Italian) in its economic sense. He used it repeatedly, and stressed the concept in his introduction to the life of Pietro Perugino, in explaining the reasons for Florentine artistic preeminence. In Vasari's view, Florentine artists excelled because they were hungry, and they were hungry because their fierce competition amongst themselves for commissions kept them so. Competition, he said, is \"one of the nourishments that maintain them.\"\n\nVasari enjoyed high repute during his lifetime and amassed a considerable fortune. In 1547, he built himself a fine house in Arezzo (now a museum honouring him), and decorated its walls and vaults with paintings. He was elected to the municipal council or priori of his native town, and finally rose to the supreme office of gonfaloniere.\n\nIn 1563, he helped found the Florence \"Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno\", with the Grand Duke and Michelangelo as \"capi\" of the institution and 36 artists chosen as members.\n\n\n\n\nCopies of Vasari's \"Lives of the Artists\" online:\n"}

The guild-like group had its own altar in the St. Bavochurch and they even had processions through town on the name day of their saint. The town suffered from uprisings in 1417 and 1422. After another uprising in 1425, a \"New\" schutterij was formed to educate young men in the use of the crossbow and they defended the city in 1426 against Jacoba of Beieren. The \"New\" crossbow schutterij had a new meeting hall built for them near the Spaarne river, and in 1468 a separate schutterij was formed under the patronage of St. Sebastian for hand bowmen. Around 1500 Haarlem had three schutterij groups, two (old and new) under the patronage of St. George (St. Joris), and one under the patronage of St. Sebastian, all with their own altars in church. \n\nIn 1520 the Haarlem schutterij was reorganized; the two groups under St. Joris were merged into one group for crossbowmen and a new group was formed under the patron saint St. Hadrian (St. Adrian), called \"Cloveniers\". Though the St. Sebastian group was also still active, by 1560 all were using muskets, and the town even owned some cannons, for which special \"kannoniers\" were trained. They still kept up their social activities in church, though the Protestant reformation began to cause various problems with their political support for the court of Justice.\n\nThe most heroic deeds of the Haarlem schutterij occurred during the Spanish siege of Haarlem, which ended in victory for the Spanish. After the changeover to the Dutch Republic in 1581, the Haarlem schutters, or shooters, were reorganized into two groups, one keeping the name St. Joris and also called the \"Oude schuts\", and the other keeping the name Cloveniers, and receiving a new building in their old location in the Gasthuisstraat in 1612, leading them to earn the nickname \"Nieuwe schuts\". The activities of both groups around their church altars, including the yearly processions, were discontinued. Today many of the shooters have been immortalized in the group portraits by Frans Hals and other portrait painters on show at the Frans Hals museum.\n\nThe split into two groups was more for convenience sake than for tradition, as the two groups were split geographically into a group north of the Bavochurch (officially renamed Grote Kerk) and a group south of the Bavochurch. \n\nThe term \"Cloveniers\", or \"Cluveniers\", just means \"musket bearers\". The group name changed over time according to the fashions and locations of the guild. Until the siege of Haarlem they were under the patronage of the Saint Adrian, but were most often referred to as the \"Jonge schuts\", or \"New shoots\", since they were formed in 1520. After the siege, since all \"Catholic\" saints were banned, and they had a new meeting hall built in 1612, they became known as the \"Nieuwe schuts\", or \"New shoots\". That meeting hall in the Gasthuisstraat is still called the \"Doelen\" building after them. Today it is a study hall and part of the Haarlem Public Library. The paintings by Hals and others hung in the main hall of the building in the Gasthuisstraat. Today all of the schutterstukken that once hung here have been transferred to the Frans Hals Museum.\n\nIn 1577, the city council refurbished the main buildings of the old St. Michiels cloister to house the schutterij called the \"Oude schuts\", whose hall had been burned in the fire of 1572. Though they officially no longer had a patron saint, they were still referred to as the \"St. Jorisdoelen\", or \"St. George militia target field\". The former garden was converted to include two shooting lanes, and a new meeting hall was built in 1592. Today the location houses a shop, restaurant, and a hofje surrounds the garden called the Proveniershuis.\n\n"}

It is the first specialised lexicon on the history of the Free State of Bavaria and its various regions.\n\nThe concept of publishing an online encyclopedia on the history of Bavaria has been worked on since the late 1990s. Work on the lexicon began in February 2005, the first articles on the module Weimar Republic were published in May 2006. By the end of 2015, the HLB, which had been expanded with modules on the Late Middle Ages in 2007 and the post-1945 period in 2008, had grown to 966 articles. The aim of the HLB is to provide comprehensive coverage of all historical eras in Bavaria since the time of prehistory. Authors of the articles are professional historians and experts in their particular field.\n\nThe HLB sees itself as part of the Bavarian Regional Library Online which has been developed since 2000. It is also the linked to the Bavarian cultural portal, bavarikon. In 2014/2015 the HLB underwent an extensive technical and optical relaunch. Since then, it has been possible to conduct a search by eras and categories, as well as entering it via a map.\n\nThe sponsors of the HLB are the Bavarian State Library (BSB), the Commission for Bavarian Regional History at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and the Conference of Regional Historians at the Bavarian universities. Its editorial team is located at the Bavarian State Library.\n\nThe project leader of the HLB is the head of Bavarica unit of BSB, Stephan Kellner. The lead historian is Ferdinand Kramer, Institute of Bavarian History at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.\nTechnical support is provided by the Munich Digitization Centre / Digital Library of BSB (Director: Markus Brantl).\n\nThe HLB is aimed both at specialist historians as well as that element of the wider public interested in history.\n\nThe HLB's articles are structured as in a traditional specialist lexicon. It provides information based on the most current research on particular subjects in compressed form. In addition, the articles are supplemented by short extracts and other information in the form of significant secondary literature, illustrations, primary sources and external links; the HLB thereby benefits from the growing electronic section of the Bavarian State Library and other institutions, by being directly linked to digitalised sources and works.\n\nAll article content is indexed by standard people and location data. Readers are able to make comments and suggestions to the author of the article via the editorial staff.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41392077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41392077", "title": "Im Tirtzu", "text": "Im Tirtzu\n\nIm Tirtzu (Hebrew: אם תרצו, lit. 'If you will it') is a Zionist non-governmental organization based in Israel. Its name is derived from an epigraph appended to the frontespiece of Theodor Herzl's novel Altneuland, 'if you wish it, it is no fairy-tale,' rendered into modern Hebrew in Nahum Sokolow's translation in 1903, as \"Im tirtzu ein zo agadah.\" (\"If you will it, it is no dream.\")\n\nOn its establishment in 2006, the organization stated that its mission was to renew \"Zionist discourse, Zionist thinking and Zionist ideology to ensure the future of the Jewish nation and the State of Israel.\" Claiming to \"strengthen and advance the values of Zionism in Israel\", it sees itself as dedicated to combating a \"campaign of de-legitimization against the State of Israel and to [provide] responses to Post-Zionist and Anti-Zionist phenomena\". Im Tirtzu is mostly known for its campaigns against the New Israel Fund, foreign government-funded NGOs, and alleged bias in the curricula of Israeli universities.\nAccording to critics, Im Tirtzu's strategies focus on delegitimizing Israeli left and human-rights groups and driving a wedge between them and their funding sources.\n\nIm Tirtzu operates fifteen branches at universities and colleges throughout the country and runs the largest Zionist academic extra-curricular program in Israel. \nSome have maintained that Im Tirtzu bears similarities to fascist groups, and others have labelled it an important Zionist movement. Im Tirtzu has received wide support from the Israeli government.\nIm Tirtzu was set up in 2006, and soon was closely meshed with a network of other bodies, new and old, such as The Legal Forum for the Land of Israel, Israel Sheli, Institute for Zionist Strategies, and NGO Monitor, organized to further Zionist aims. It was little known until February 2010 when it made headlines with a claim that Israeli NGOs, esp. the New Israel Fund, were in good part responsible for the damage to Israel’s international standing that resulted from the publication of the Goldstone Report regarding the conduct of the 2008-2009 Gaza War. Some three months later, Kadima led by Ronit Tirosh, together with right wing parties, proposed a bill to outlaw any NGO that furnished foreign or international organizations with information that might buttress accusations of war crimes by either Israel or the IDF. \n\nIn 2008, Im Tirtzu published a report about the syllabuses used in various academic departments in Israel. According to the report, authors who reject the notion of nationality, or support anti-Zionist views, get much more exposure in reading lists. In 2010, Im Tirtzu sent Rivka Karmi, the head of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev a letter, demanding that the university stop the anti-Zionist bias in its Department of Politics and Government. The letter alleged that 9 out of 11 professors in the department were involved in extreme left-wing activities (among others, attempting to persuade other countries to join the academic boycott of Israel). Im Tirtzu threatened to notify the donors of the university if the problem was not rectified.\n\nIn a joint statement about the above campaign, the heads of Israel's seven leading universities urged condemnation of what they called Im Tirtzu's \"dangerous attempt to create a thought police\". Im Tirtzu responded, \"All Im Tirtzu asked from BGU is that a solution be found to the extreme bias found in the Political Science department, where only post-Zionist opinions are presented.\"\n\nFollowing Im Tirtzu's report, the Israeli Council for Higher Education appointed an international committee to investigate the allegations. The committee came to the conclusion that the curriculum in the Political Science department was imbalanced. The committee said it was \"concerned that the study of politics as a scientific discipline may be impeded by such strong emphasis on political activism\", and recommended closing the department unless changes were made. The report was widely criticized by academics, who said that it was politically motivated, noting that well-known scholars had been rejected from the committee because of their political views and that the original committee chair had resigned. Minister of Education, Gideon Sa'ar, said \"I believe the report is important since it encourages public discussion\" but rejected any attempts to block or apply conditions for donations to Israeli universities.\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu alleged that Ben-Gurion University was sponsoring a conference featuring the CEO and public relations coordinator of Breaking the Silence in violation of a ruling by Israel's Council for Higher Education against politicizing academia. The University denied claims of politicization and responded that it is a \"pluralistic academic institution, which promotes and enables an open and diverse dialogue and does not seek to espouse a particular political viewpoint\".\n\nIn response to the conference, a prominent donor and longstanding member of the university's board of governors announced that he was withholding a donation of $1 million due to the conference. The university responded that they were unaware of such a pledge.\n\nIn 2013 Im Tirtzu released a report alleging \"severe politicization\" of the legal clinics at the University of Haifa. According to the report, 80% of the cases treated by the clinics dealt with security prisoners, among those convicted of terrorism and espionage.\n\nThe report charged that certain clinics of the University are part of the \"Arab nationalist struggle against Zionism\" and \"cooperate with organizations that oppose the existence of the State of Israel as a democratic state\".\n\nFollowing the report, then Minister of Education Shai Piron together with the Council for Higher Education in Israel commissioned an international committee of experts to investigate the clinics. In 2016, the committee published its recommendations that matched \"virtually all of the conclusions from the Im Tirtzu report\".\n\nFollowing numerous media reports citing Im Tirtzu's criticism of a Minerva Center program that offers students four academic credits and a scholarship in exchange for interning eight hours per week at a human rights organization, a group of bereaved families penned a letter to Education Minister Naftali Bennett calling on him to investigate the program.\n\nAccording to the bereaved families, they were \"horrified\" to learn that the program allows for internship at organizations including B'Tselem, HaMoked and Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, which they called \"anti-Israel\" organizations.\n\nAt a Knesset Education Committee that was convened to discuss the program, Hebrew University's legal advisor Pepi Yakirevich stated: \"The program asks of students to volunteer 8 weekly hours in human rights organizations that the Law Faculty sees of holding high importance... Do you expect for the Hebrew University to act as a content filter? At the moment there is no red line.\"\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu released a report alleging the involvement of Israeli academics in the proposed resolution of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) to impose an academic boycott on Israel. The report cited a letter allegedly sent by 20 Israeli academics that the group said encouraged the members to vote in favor of the resolution. In light of the report, Yisrael Beiteinu Member of Knesset Oded Forer called an emergency session of the Knesset Education Committee that was attended by MKs from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu released a report stating that a number of Israeli citizens and organizations were among the participants in the annual Israeli Apartheid Week. The report named Zochrot and individuals including Ilan Pappe, Uri Davis and Jeff Halper.\n\nGuy Davidi, producer of 5 Broken Cameras who was also named in the report, responded by saying: \"I strongly reject the attempt to present boycott actions taken by Israelis as an act of treason. In my view, boycotting and divesting are legitimate political actions that represent a positive way to protest -- a positive alternative to violent action, which I strongly condemn. It is the right of every person to choose to boycott certain products if they don't accept the origin or the way the product is manufactured.\"\n\nIn May 2011, with the approach of Nakba Day, Im Tirtzu launched a campaign accompanied by a 70-page booklet titled \"Nakba Harta\" in Hebrew (נכבה חרטא), translated by \"The Jerusalem Post\" as \"Nakba BS\", and titled \"Nakba Nonsense\" in English. The booklet describes the 1948 Palestinian exodus, called \"Nakba\" by Palestinians, as \"a lie that threatens to drown us like a tsunami\" and attempts to discredit what Im Tirtzu regards as \"a narrative of myths and lies dealing with the teaching of the founding of the State of Israel\". On 15 May 2011, dozens of Im Tirtzu activists gathered outside the offices of UNRWA in Jerusalem holding signs and chanting, \"They expelled, they attacked, they lost.\"\n\nIn 2016, Im Tirtzu set up a 15-foot-tall inflatable Pinocchio doll across from the Nakba ceremony at Tel Aviv University in order to \"emphasize the lie of the Nakba.\"\n\nIm Tirtzu has acted in a number of ways to support IDF soldiers:\n\n\nIm Tirtzu has advocated for minorities in Israel to join the Israeli military. The Forum for Drafting the Christian Community and its founder Father Gabriel Naddaf have worked closely with Im Tirtzu to encourage and promote the safety of Christian Israelis who wish to perform IDF service. Father Naddaf is a frequent guest speaker at Im Tirtzu events and sits on their Public Council. Other Israeli Arabs who promote the integration of minorities in Israeli society have received awards from the movement.\n\nIm Tirtzu has also organized social activities with Israeli minorities, including distributing clothing and toys in Bedouin kindergartens and organizing meetings and tours in Druze villages. Following an act of vandalism against Jerusalem's Dormition Abbey, in which vandals spray-painted anti-Christian slogans, Im Tirtzu activists arrived for a solidarity visit. Im Tirtzu CEO Matan Peleg stated: \"[We] see this as an act that is at its very core both anti-Zionist as well as anti-Israeli, an act which dangerously threatens all of the Israeli society.\"\n\nIn 2015, a new parliamentary caucus to encourage minorities to join the army was created based on the idea of Im Tirtzu. The opening ceremony of the caucus was attended by MKs from the right, center, and left.\n\nIn 2016, Im Tirtzu's fourth annual Zionist Conference for Human Rights centered around the integration of minorities, featuring speeches from Deputy Minister Ayoob Kara, Father Gabriel Naddaf and other Israeli Arabs.\n\nIn 2012, Im Tirtzu inaugurated its first Program for Zionist Thought, a serious of lectures given by prominent Israeli figures and personalities. The program is featured at Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University, Ben-Gurion University, University of Haifa, Bar-Ilan University, and Ariel University.\n\nSome of the speakers include Nobel Prize laureate Robert Aumann, Caroline Glick, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, Father Gabriel Naddaf, Ben-Dror Yemini, Mordechai Kedar, Major General Yaakov Amidror, former MK Einat Wilf, Rabbi David Stav, Yoram Ettinger, and Ran Baratz.\n\nThe program is the largest Zionist academic extra-curricular program in Israel.\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu began to organize student tours of Hebron together with the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\n\nAccording to Im Tirtzu CEO Matan Peleg, the tours are aimed to provide an answer to the tours of Hebron given by left-wing NGO Breaking the Silence, which he dubs \"de-legitimization and lies\".\n\nIn September 2017 Im Tirtzu held a conference celebrating ten years of activity. Hundreds of activists and supporters participated in the event, which featured a keynote speech from Speaker of the Knesset Yuli-Yoel Edelstein and video-recorded congratulatory messages from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, and a number of other ministers, members of Knesset, and cultural figures.\n\nIn 2012, Im Tirtzu organized a campaign against Israeli-Arab actor Mohammed Bakri who was slated to appear in Federico Garcia Lorca's \"The House of Bernarda Alba\" at Tel Aviv's Tzavta Theater. Im Tirtzu objected to Bakri because of his involvement in the film \"Jenin, Jenin\". In a \"Haaretz\" opinion piece, Im Tirtzu chairman Ronen Shoval called \"Jenin, Jenin\" an antisemitic blood libel \"unprecedented in its fierceness\" and referred to Bakri as a \"sophisticated enemy\". Shoval accused the Tzavta Club of offering a platform to \"an inciter and a liar\".\n\nIn 2010, Im Tirtzu published a document and launched a campaign in the Israeli media that said there were connections between organizations supported by the New Israel Fund and the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (also known as the Goldstone Report). Im Tirtzu said that 92 percent of all Israeli testimonials in the report came from NIF funded organizations. The campaign included \"vilifying\" NIF chairwoman Naomi Chazan as an agent of Hamas and Iran and the diffusion of posters caricaturing her with a horn strapped by a string on her forehead (in Hebrew, the word for \"horn\" also means \"fund\"), and a caption reading \"Naomi-Goldstone-Chazan.\" According to Ron Kampeas (Jewish Telegraphic Agency) Im Tirtzu's report said 16 NIF affiliated groups comprised 14 percent of all sources for the Goldstone report, while stating in a separate section that these constitute 92 percent of Israel-based negative reporting in the Goldstone report; some reporting had incorrectly confused the two separate figures and accused Im Tirzu as being inaccurate.\n\nAs a result of the report there were calls in the Knesset to investigate the NIF and its operational arms in Israel. Benny Begin, a cabinet minister at the time, characterized the allegations Im Tirtzu published as \"lies\" in a radio interview. Abe Foxman said it was \"absurd to blame Goldstone on the NIF\".\n\nChazan claimed that, in her eyes, the campaign was directed against democracy itself. The executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Hagai El-Ad, denied Im Tirtzu's allegations. Gideon Levy, writing in \"Haaretz\", likened Im Tirtzu's campaign against NIF to fascist tactics. Gershon Baskin, a columnist in \"The Jerusalem Post\", spoke out about the newspaper's decision to cancel Naomi Chazan's column and accused Im Tirtzu of using an \"anti-Semitic motif\" as part of a \"witch-hunt\" that \"is reminiscent of the darkest days of McCarthyism\". That poster was called \"style \"Der Stürmer\"\" by the Facebook group \"Im Tirzu - fascists\" and was charged for libel by \"Im Tirtzu\". Judge Refael Yaakobi accepted the characterization of Im Tirtzu's poster as being similar in style to that of the Nazi party's newspaper, writing in the court's decision, \"examining that publication and the source for comparison reveals that indeed there is truth in the matter.\"\n\nDuring Operation Pillar of Defense, Im Tirtzu published an open letter in American Jewish newspapers addressed to the New Israel Fund chair. The letter gave examples of NIF funded organizations that Im Tirtzu said accused Israel of war crimes, and asked if the NIF agrees with their accusations. The NIF rebutted Im Tirtzu's charges, stating, \"Not one of the human rights organizations Im Tirtzu attacks accused Israel of war crimes in the recent Gaza action.\" NIF also quoted Avichai Mandelblit, the IDF's Chief Military Advocate General during Operation Cast Lead: \"The organizations are a conduit for getting information on very important matters so that IDF activity is normative... I'm trying to get at the truth and they really help us do that. Our cooperation with B'tselem [A NIF-supported group] stands out. They help us to speak with witnesses, to investigate complaints ... with all of the criticism from these organizations on us, their goal is to get to the truth.\"\n\nIn December 2015, Im Tirtzu launched a campaign calling Israeli left-wing and human rights organizations that receive funding from foreign entities as \"foreign agents\". It released a video depicting the heads of these organizations as foreign agents encouraging terrorist attacks; the Anti-Defamation League criticized the video as \"hate speech;\" a lawsuit against Im Tirtzu for incitement to violence was dismissed after the Attorney General determined that the video was urging the Israeli public to support MK Yoav Kisch's \"foreign agent bill\". They also made a Facebook post calling a number of Israeli artists \"cultural foreign agents\". Following criticism, Im Tirtzu apologized and CEO Matan Peleg decided to suspend himself over the decision to upload the post.\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu released a report claiming that the Israeli NGO HaMoked received over 15 million NIS from European governments and has submitted nearly 60 petitions to the Supreme Court from mid-2014 to 2016 on behalf of 48 families of Palestinian terrorists responsible for the murder of 50 people.\n\nHaMoked declined to comment on the report.\n\nIn response to the report, MK Oded Forer submitted a bill that would require organizations that receive the majority of their funding from foreign governments to declare their funding sources on every document submitted to the court.\n\nIm Tirtzu released a report ahead of 2017's International Holocaust Remembrance Day detailing Germany's funding of the NGO Zochrot, which works to \"promote Israeli Jewish society's acknowledgement of and accountability for the ongoing injustices of the Nakba and the reconceptualization of Return as the imperative redress of the Nakba\".\n\nAccording to the report, the Government of Germany had provided over 1,100,000 shekels ($290,000) to Zochrot from 2012 to 2016, which is used by Zochrot to engage in \"anti-Israeli\" activities including screening its \"Film Festival on Nakba and the Right of Return\" on college campuses during \"Israeli Apartheid Week\", promoting an \"iNakba\" smartphone application, and accusing Israel of \"ethnic cleansing\".\n\nIm Tirtzu contacted the German Ambassador to Israel over the funding, yet received no response.\n\nIn May 2011 the organization called on Attorney-General Yehuda Weinstein to launch a criminal investigation into the operations of Machsom Watch (an NIF funded organization) for allegedly violating an IDF order prohibiting Israelis from entering the Palestinian village of Awarta. About a week before the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) revealed the identities of the murder suspects for the Itamar attack, senior Machsom Watch activist, Raya Yaron, was photographed hugging the mother of one of the men. Yaron said many other human rights organizations had also visited the village.\n\nIn May 2012 Peace Now filed a police complaint that said Im Tirtzu activists had impersonated Peace Now activists and waved Palestinian flags during Jerusalem Day celebrations in what was reported as a presumed attempt to portray them as Palestinian sympathizers. They described Im Tirtzu as an \"extremist movement\" that, together with \"extreme Islamic movements on the Arab side\", they claimed would \"drag us to a religious war steeped in blood\". Im Tirtzu accused Peace Now of \"impersonating an Israeli organization while operating with backing from foreign countries in order to give the Temple Mount to Palestinian Authority\" and said freedom of speech gave them the right to ridicule Peace Now's positions.\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu issued a report stating that at least seven foreign government funded organizations that it deemed \"anti-Israel\" are eligible to receive Sherut Leumi (National Service) positions.\n\nIn response to the report, MK Amir Ohana introduced a bill in cooperation with Im Tirtzu that was supported by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which aimed to cancel national service positions in groups that receive the majority of their funding from foreign governments.\n\nThe bill was later passed into law by the Knesset in a vote of 40–12.\n\nIn 2015 Im Tirtzu released a report titled \"Activity of Israeli Organizations with Advisor Status to the United Nations, Against Israeli Policy\", which claims that three Israeli NGOs use their U.N. advisor to promote anti-Israel sentiments in the United Nations.\n\nAccording to the report, Adalah, Ittijah, and the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions encourage the U.N. to accuse Israel of international law violations. These three organizations declined to comment on the report.\n\nFollowing the release of the findings by the \"United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict\", Im Tirtzu released a report detailing the use by the UN of research by Israeli NGOs in the report.\n\nAccording to the report, the UN report contained 72 references to reports by B'tselem, 8 references to Adalah, 8 references to Breaking the Silence, 12 references to HaMoked: Center for the Defence of the Individual, and 5 references to Yesh Din.\n\nAhead of 2016's Jerusalem Day, Im Tirtzu released a report claiming that the Palestinian organization Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Secretariat transfers millions of dollars to Israeli NGOs in order to delegitimize Israel and \"obscure Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem\". According to the report, the Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Secretariat acts as an independent organizations that manages donations from Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Holland and then transfers them to pro-BDS Palestinian and Israeli NGOs.\n\nSarit Michaeli, the spokesperson for B'Tselem – one of the NGOs named in the report as receiving funds – said \"this is a recycled lie by Im Tirtzu. This money actually comes from Switzerland, Holland, Denmark and Sweden. This organization transfers the funds from the donating countries and deals with the bureaucracy of the transfer. The organization itself does not determine who receives the funds.\"\n\nIn 2010, Im Tirtzu received funding from the following sources:\n\nUnder John Hagee's management, Christians United for Israel was a funder of Im Tirtzu but discontinued the funding on the grounds that Im Tirtzu \"misrepresented its focus\" by claiming that their work focused on \"Zionist education\" rather than \"political\" activity according to a spokesperson for the Evangelical organization.\n\nAccording to Uri Blau, in an Haaretz investigation Im Tirtzu, though highly critical of foreign governmental funding for 'leftist' Israeli NGOs, is itself the beneficiary of substantial donations from two American organisations closely associated with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.During the 2015 election, Shining City, a U.S. front group, contributed 3.7 million shekels (about 1 million U.S. dollars) to Im Tirtzu. Rabbi Aryeh Lightstone, the alleged leader of Shining City, now serves as senior adviser to U.S. ambassador to Israel David M. Friedman. According to Im Tirzu, most of its donors are Israelis, but the group is \"pleased to find private donors from around the world as well (individuals and private foundations)\" except those that are from a \"foreign state entity or foundations that promote delegitimization of Israeli society\".\n\nThe group was founded in 2006 by Ronen Shoval, who also served as its chairman until his retirement in 2013, and Erez Tadmor, who was a group spokesperson until his retirement in 2011.\n\nFollowing Ronen's retirement, Matan Peleg was elected as Im Tirtzu's chairman. Peleg was the founder of the Im Tirtzu branch in Haifa and the head of the northern branch of the movement. After Erez's retired, Matan replaced him in the role of missions coordinator. Alon Schwartzer was elected as head of the policy department alongside Matan.\n\nMatan Peleg suspended himself in January 2016 in the wake of an Im Tirtzu campaign against Israeli artists who supported human rights groups. Several months later in May 2016 Peleg returned to his role.\n\nA NIS 2.6-million lawsuit was filed by Im Tirtzu against Israelis who had opened a Facebook page that suggested that Im Tirtzu was a Fascist group. A court in Jerusalem rejected some of the charges but found one person guilty of slander. In the verdict the Judge Refael Ya'akobi found that there were commonalities between the group and \"certain principles of Fascism\". He also stated that it is clear that the defendants are \"bitter adversaries\" of Im Tirtzu. He additionally wrote that the defendants do not imply a full identification Fascism with Im Tirtzu, but only some common lines. Finally the judge ruled that as Im Tirtzu emphasizes national aspects, the defendants can rely on the protections set in the law in order to be acquitted. and wrote also that there is truth in comparing the poster of \"Im Tirtzu\" against the New Israel Fund to the style of the Nazi newspaper \"Der Stürmer\". The judge wrote: \"One should view these publications (against Im Tirtzu) as saying and warning that past experience teaches that support of similar principles to those that Im Tirtzu supports ... brought harsh and bad results.\" In September 2013, the judge rejected the majority of Im Tirtzu's arguments, and cleared four of the five defendants. One defendant, Roy Yellin, was found to have libeled Im Tirtzu by implying that the group shared the \"Nazi race theory\". However, the judge criticised Im Tirtzu for bringing the action in the first place, and postponed awarding any damages for the one successful claim. In February 2014, the court rejected Im Tirtzu's claim for damages, though it also rejected the defendants' claim for legal costs. Both Im Tirtzu and the defendants appealed to the high court. In the appeal, the high court declared the previous ruling as void and null and decided that the libel suit should have not been heard in court, since the main discussion is ideological, not juridical.\n\nIn court proceedings, Professor Zeev Sternhell, one of the world's leading experts on Fascism, testified that Im Tirtzu was \"not worse than Fascism, it is that, more or less\". He also testified that Fascist principles \"provide a basis for Im Tirtzu's operations\". Sternhell analyzed the writings published by Im Tirtzu and observed expressions of fascist thinking in the writings of the group's founder. These include seeing the nation as an organic body, viewing the West as being weakened, and describing the situation in the country as an emergency situation that requires unusual action against \"traitors\".\n\nOther court testimony documented that Im Tirtzu's founder admitted to drawing inspiration from German philosophers considered to have been precursors to Fascist ideology.\n\nIn 2016, Knesset Member Benny Begin also used the term \"Fascist\" to describe a campaign by the organization.\n\nIn 2009, Im Tirtzu's largest donor was the John Hagee Ministries (JHM) via the Christian-Zionist organization Christians United for Israel (CUFI). Im Tirtzu received US$100,000 from JHM and $34,000 from other sources. In 2010, \"The Jerusalem Post\" reported that JHM \"expressed deep displeasure\" with Im Tirtzu after its campaigns against the New Israel Fund and Ben-Gurion University and announced the cessation of its funding. A JHM spokesman said that Im Tirtzu \"misrepresented its focus when they told us their mission was strictly Zionist education\".\n\nThe group's former spokesperson, Erez Tadmor, was found guilty of embezzling munitions from the Israeli military.\n\nThe organization was accused of acting in an Anti-Semitic fashion, including emulating Nazi propaganda, in its criticisms of U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk and of the New Israel Fund.\n\nHaaretz newspaper alleged that \"Im Tirtzu has taken over political discourse in Israel, and injected into it the crazy idea of the internal enemy,\" and accused The Jewish Home party as \"operating as the political arm of Im Tirtzu.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly endorsed Im Tirtzu.\n\nIm Tirtzu has been active on college campuses throughout Israel, and has received support from members of the Israeli Parliament and prominent Israeli writers and personalities.\n\nArutz Sheva has described Im Tirtzu as the largest Zionist movement in Israel.\n\nIn a 2012 Ministry of Culture and Education competition, Im Tirtzu won first prize for their video titled, \"Zionism Without Jerusalem?\" In a competition featuring almost 150 entries, Im Tirtzu's video won the most popular video, and was awarded a prize of 25,000 shekels.\n"}
{"id": "6229482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6229482", "title": "Japanese eel", "text": "Japanese eel\n\nThe Japanese eel (\"Anguilla japonica\"; Japanese: 日本鰻 \"nihon'unagi\") is a species of anguillid eel found in Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, as well as the northern Philippines. Like all the eels of the genus \"Anguilla\" and the family Anguillidae, it is catadromous, meaning it spawns in the sea, but lives parts of its life in fresh water. The spawning area of this species is in the North Equatorial Current in the western North Pacific to the west of the Mariana Islands. The larvae are called leptocephali and are carried westward by the North Equatorial Current and then northward by the Kuroshio Current to East Asia, where they live in rivers, lakes, and estuaries. The Japanese eel is an important food fish in East Asia, where it is raised in aquaculture ponds in most countries in the region. In Japan, where they are called \"unagi\", they are an important part of the food culture, with many restaurants serving grilled eel, which is called \"kabayaki\". Eels also have uses in Chinese medicine.\n\nThe Japanese eel and other anguillid eels live in fresh water and estuaries where they feed and grow as yellow eels for a number of years before they begin to mature and become silver eels. The silver eels then migrate out of fresh water into the ocean and start their long journey to their spawning area. Adult Japanese eels migrate thousands of kilometers from freshwater rivers in East Asia to their spawning area without feeding. The spawning area of this species was discovered in 1991 by collecting small leptocephali about 10 mm in size, and then in 2005 the same team of Japanese scientists at the University of Tokyo found a more precise location of spawning based on genetically identified specimens of newly hatched preleptocephali only 2 to 5 days old in a small area near the Suruga Seamount to the west of the Mariana Islands (14–17° N, 142–143° E).\n\nSince then, more pre-leptocephali have been collected at sea, and even Japanese eel eggs have been collected and genetically identified on the research vessel. The collections of eggs and recently hatched larvae have been made along the western side of the seamount chain of the West Mariana Ridge. Mature adults of the Japanese eel and giant mottled eel were captured using large midwater trawls in 2008 by Japanese scientists at the Fisheries Research Agency. The adults of the Japanese eel appear to spawn in the upper few hundred meters of the ocean, based on the recent catches of their spawning adults, eggs, and newly hatched larvae. The timing of catches of eggs and larvae and the ages of larger larvae have shown that Japanese eels only spawn during the few days just before the new moon period of each month during their spawning season.\n\nAfter hatching in the ocean, the leptocephali are carried westward by the North Equatorial Current and then northward by the Kuroshio Current to East Asia. In the open ocean, the larvae feed on marine snow, before they metamorphose into the glass eel stage. The glass eels then enter the estuaries and headwaters of rivers and many travel upstream. In fresh water and estuaries, the diet of yellow eels consists mainly of shrimp, other crustaceans, aquatic insects, and small fishes.\n\nThe Japanese eel population, along with anguillid eel populations worldwide, have declined drastically in recent years, presumably due to a combination of overfishing and habitat loss or changing water conditions in the ocean interfering with spawning and the transport of their leptocephali. In the case of the Japanese eel, spawning is likely affected by the north-south shifts of a salinity front created by an area of low-salinity waters resulting from tropical rainfall. The front is thought to be detected by the adult spawning eels and to affect the latitudes at which they spawn. A northward shift in the front that occurred over the past 30 years appears to have occurred, which could cause more larvae to be retained in eddies offshore in the region east of Taiwan, and southward shifts in the salinity front have been observed in recent years that could increase southward transport into the Mindanao Current that flows into the Celebes Sea. These types of unfavorable larval transport are thought to reduce the recruitment success of the Japanese eels that reach river mouths as glass eels.\n\nThe Japanese freshwater eel produces a fluorescent protein. This protein is the basis of a new test to assess dangerous blood toxins that can trigger liver disease.\n\nIn the manga and anime series \"\", in Team Shokugeki, Satoshi Isshiki and Jurio Shiratsu are competing each other with Japanese eel as main ingredient.\n\nIn various Super Mario games, most notably Super Mario 64 and New Super Mario Bros there is an enemy by the of name Maw-Ray. This a reference to the Japanese eel, as the character was previously called simply Unagi.\n\n"}
{"id": "1557427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1557427", "title": "Jorge Luis Borges bibliography", "text": "Jorge Luis Borges bibliography\n\nThis is a bibliography of works by Argentine short-story writer, essayist, poet, and translator Jorge Luis Borges (1899–1986).\n\nEach year links to its corresponding \"[year] in literature\" article (for prose) or \"[year] in poetry\" article (for verse).\n\nThis list follows the chronology of original (typically Spanish-language) publication in books, based in part on the rather comprehensive (but incomplete) bibliography online at the Borges Center (originally the J. L. Borges Center for Studies & Documentation at the University of Aarhus, then at the University of Iowa, now—as of 2010—at the University of Pittsburgh). The following list focuses on book-length \npublication of original work (including collaborative work): it does not include individual short stories, poems, and translations published in magazines, nor does it include books (such as anthologies of fantasy and of Argentine literature) that Borges edited or co-edited. It also excludes several chapbooks, privately printed editions, etc. of under 50 pages each and does not attempt to identify first publication dates of individual stories, poems, etc. ISBNs refer to recent editions, not original publications. (Many English-language titles and ISBNs still missing. Some of the volumes might be better classified in terms of genre.)\n\nThere are also 1953, 1974, 1984, and 1989 \"Obras completas\" (complete works) with varying degrees of completeness and a 1981 \"Obras completas en coloboración\" (complete collaborative works).\n\nSeveral bibliographies also choose to include a collection of previously published essays, published in 1971 under the name \"Narraciones\".\n\nSome web-based lists misattribute \"El Caudillo\", (1921 novel), to Borges. It was actually written by his father, also a Jorge Borges.\n\n\n\nThe translations of the titles are from \"Collected Fictions\", translated by Andrew Hurley. The information is compiled from the \"Bibliografía cronológica de la obra de Jorge Luis Borges\" by Annick Louis and Florian Ziche. Not all of these works can be classified as short stories. For example, \"The Dread Redeemer Lazarus Morell\" is largely factual, but it reads like a work of fiction. Conversely, the fictional \"Pierre Menard, Author of the \"Quixote\"\" is written in a style resembling an essay in literary criticism.\n\nThe groupings represent books in which these were first published; they are listed by the English translation of the original Spanish-language book.\n\n\n\nBorges's work was first published in book form in English in 1962, with the translation and publication of \"Ficciones\" (1944) and the collection known as \"Labyrinths\".\n\nIn 1967, Borges began a five-year period of collaboration with the American translator Norman Thomas di Giovanni, after which he became better known in the English-speaking world. Di Giovanni would continue to be his primary English-language translator from that time forward.\n\nThis is a listing of book-length English-language volumes that are reorganizations of Borges' works; translations of original collections are listed above.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "515922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=515922", "title": "Judith Miller", "text": "Judith Miller\n\nJudith Miller (born January 2, 1948) is an American journalist and commentator known for her coverage of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) program both before and after the 2003 invasion, which was later discovered to have been based on inaccurate information from the intelligence community. She worked in \"The New York Times\" Washington bureau before joining Fox News in 2008.\n\nMiller co-wrote a book, \"\", which became a top \"New York Times\" best seller shortly after she became a victim of the 2001 anthrax attacks. \n\n\"The New York Times\" determined several stories she wrote about Iraq were inaccurate, and she was forced to resign from the paper in 2005. According to commentator Ken Silverstein, Miller's Iraq reporting \"effectively ended her career as a respectable journalist\". Miller acknowledged in \"The Wall Street Journal\" on April 4, 2015, that some of her \"Times\" coverage was inaccurate, although she relied on sources she had used previously. She further stated that policymakers and intelligence analysts had relied on the same sources, and that at the time there was broad consensus that Iraq had WMD. In a book published in 2015, Miller attempted to convince people that reporting is difficult.\n\nMiller was involved in the Plame Affair which outed Valerie Plame as a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) spy. Miller spent 85 days in jail for refusing to reveal that her source in the Plame Affair was Scooter Libby. Later, she contributed to the Fox News Channel and was a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute. On December 29, 2010, numerous media outlets reported that she had signed on as a contributing writer to the conservative magazine \"Newsmax\".\n\nHer Russian-born father, Bill Miller, was Jewish. He owned a night club in New Jersey and later in Las Vegas.\nBill Miller was famous for booking iconic Las Vegas performances. His biggest success was getting Elvis Presley to return to Las Vegas after initially bombing. Her mother was a \"pretty Irish Catholic showgirl\".\n\nMiller attended Ohio State University, where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. She graduated from Barnard College in 1969 and received a master's degree in public affairs from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Early in her career at the \"Times\" bureau in Washington, D.C. she dated \"Times\" reporter and future investment banker Steven Rattner. In 1993, she married Jason Epstein, an editor and publisher.\n\nJudith Miller is the half sister of the late Jimmy Miller famous as the recording producer for many classic Rock bands of the 60's through the 90's including the Rolling Stones, Traffic and Cream.\n\nDuring Miller's tenure at \"The New York Times\", she was a member of the team that won the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting, for its 2001 coverage of global terrorism before and after the September 11 attacks. She and James Risen received the award and one of the cited articles appeared under her byline.\n\nHer writing during this period has been criticised by Middle-east scholar Edward Said for the anti-Islamic bias in her writing. In his book \"Covering Islam\" Said stated that Miller's book \"God Has Ninety-Nine Names\" \"is like a textbook of the inadequacies and distortions of media coverage of Islam.\" He criticised her poor grasp of Arabic, saying that \"nearly every time she tries to impress us with her ability to say a phrase or two in Arabic she unerringly gets it wrong... They are the crude mistakes committed by a foreigner who neither has care nor... respect for her subject.\" He concludes, \"she fears and dislikes Lebanon, hates Syria, laughs at Libya, dismisses Sudan, feels sorry for and a little alarmed by Egypt and is repulsed by Saudi Arabia. She hasn't bothered to learn the language and is relentlessly only concerned with the dangers of Islamic militancy, which, I would hazard a guess, accounts for less than 5 percent of the billion-strong Islamic world.\" However, Miller asserted that in the wake of the September 11 attacks she argued that militant Islamism of the type represented by Al Qaeda had peaked and was fading into insignificance.\n\nOn October 12, 2001, Miller opened an anthrax hoax letter mailed to her \"New York Times\" office. The 2001 anthrax attacks had begun occurring in the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001, with anthrax-laced letters sent to ABC News, CBS News, NBC News, and the \"New York Post\", all in New York City, as well as the \"National Enquirer\" in Boca Raton, Florida. Two additional letters (with a higher grade of anthrax) were sent on October 9, 2001, to Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy in Washington. Twenty-two people were infected; five died. In 2008, the government's investigation of these mailings focused on Bruce Ivins, who later committed suicide, with the investigation determining that Ivins acted alone.\n\nMiller was the only major U.S. media reporter, and \"The New York Times\" the only major U.S. media organization, to be victimized by a fake anthrax letter in the fall of 2001. Miller had reported extensively on the subject of biological threats and had co-authored, with Stephen Engelberg and William Broad, a book on bio-terrorism, \"\" which was published on October 2, 2001. Miller co-authored an article on Pentagon plans to develop a more potent version of weaponized anthrax, \"U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits\", published in \"The New York Times\" on September 4, 2001, weeks before the first anthrax mailings.\n\nMiller also participated in a senior-level bio-terror attack simulation on Oklahoma City conducted on June 22 and June 23, 2001, called \"Operation Dark Winter\"; her role was media reporter/observer.\n\nShortly after the September 11 attacks, the U.S. government was considering adding the Holy Land Foundation to a list of organizations with suspected links to terrorism and was planning to search the premises of the organization. The information about the impending raid was given to Miller by a confidential source. On December 3, 2001, Miller telephoned the Holy Land Foundation for comment, and \"The New York Times\" published an article in the late edition papers and on its website that day. The next day, the government searched HLF's offices. These occurrences led to a lawsuit brought by US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, with prosecutors claiming that Miller and her colleague Philip Shenon had queried this Islamic charity, and another, in ways that made them aware of the planned searches.\n\nAt \"The New York Times\", Miller wrote on security issues, particularly about Iraq and weapons of mass destruction. Many of these stories later turned out to have been based upon faulty information. (One of her stories that wasn't disproved reported that inspectors in Iraq \"saw nothing to prompt a war.\")\n\nOn September 8, 2002, Miller and fellow \"Times\" reporter Michael R. Gordon reported the interception of \"aluminum tubes\" bound for Iraq. Her front-page story quoted unnamed \"American officials\" and \"American intelligence experts\" who said the tubes were intended to be used to enrich nuclear material, and cited unnamed \"Bush administration officials\" who claimed that, in recent months, Iraq had \"stepped up its quest for nuclear weapons and [had] embarked on a worldwide hunt for materials to make an atomic bomb\". Miller added that\n\nMr. Hussein's dogged insistence on pursuing his nuclear ambitions, along with what defectors described in interviews as Iraq's push to improve and expand Baghdad's chemical and biological arsenals, have brought Iraq and the United States to the brink of war.\n\nShortly after Miller's article was published, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, and Donald Rumsfeld appeared on television and pointed to Miller's story in support of their position. As summarized by the \"New York Review of Books\", \"in the following months, the tubes would become a key prop in the administration's case for war, and the \"Times\" played a critical part in legitimizing it.\" Miller later said of the controversy\n\n[M]y job isn't to assess the government's information and be an independent intelligence analyst myself. My job is to tell readers of \"The New York Times\" what the government thought about Iraq's arsenal.\n\nIn an April 2003 article, Miller, ostensibly on the basis of statements from the military unit in which she was embedded, reported claims allegedly made by an Iraqi scientist that Iraq had kept biological and chemical weapons until \"right before the invasion.\" This report was widely repeated in the press. Miller went on \"The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\" and stated:\n\nWell, I think they found something more than a smoking gun. What they've found is a silver bullet in the form of a person, an Iraqi individual, a scientist, as we've called him, who really worked on the programs, who knows them firsthand, and who has led MET Alpha people to some pretty startling conclusions.\n\nOn May 26, 2004, a week after the U.S. government apparently severed ties with Ahmed Chalabi, a \"Times\" editorial acknowledged that some of the paper's coverage in the run-up to the war had relied too heavily on Chalabi and other Iraqi exiles, who were bent on regime change. The editorial also expressed \"regret\" that \"information that was controversial [was] allowed to stand unchallenged.\" However, the editorial explicitly rejected \"blame on individual reporters.\"\n\nOn May 27, 2004, the day after the \"Times\"' \"mea culpa,\" James C. Moore quoted Miller in an article in \"Salon\":\n\nYou know what, ... I was proved fucking right. That's what happened. People who disagreed with me were saying, 'There she goes again.' But I was proved fucking right.\"\n\nThe statement about being \"proved...right\" was in relation to another Miller story, wherein she'd claimed that trailers found in Iraq had been shown to be mobile weapons labs. However that claim, too, was subsequently refuted as false.\n\nIt was alleged later in \"Editor & Publisher\" that, while Miller's reporting \"frequently [did] not meet published \"Times\" standards\", she was not sanctioned and was given a relatively free rein, because she consistently delivered frequent front-page scoops for the paper by \"cultivating top-ranking sources.\"\n\nIn 2005, facing federal court proceedings for refusing to divulge a source in the Plame affair criminal investigation, Miller spent 85 days in jail in Alexandria, Va. (where French terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui was also held). After her release, the \"Times\"' Public Editor Byron Calame wrote:\n\nMs. Miller may still be best known for her role in a series of \"Times\" articles in 2002 and 2003 that strongly suggested Saddam Hussein already had or was acquiring an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction ... Many of those articles turned out to be inaccurate ... [T]he problems facing her inside and outside the newsroom will make it difficult for her to return to the paper as a reporter. \n\nTwo weeks later, Miller negotiated a private severance package with \"Times\"' publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. She contested Calame's claims about her reporting and gave no ground in defending her work. She cited \"difficulty\" in performing her job effectively after having become \"an integral part of the stories [she] was sent to cover.\"\n\nIn July 2005, several months prior to her October 2005 resignation from \"The New York Times\", Miller was jailed for contempt of court for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury investigating a leak naming Valerie Plame as a CIA officer. While Miller never wrote about Plame, she was believed to be in possession of evidence relevant to the leak investigation. According to a subpoena, Miller met with an unnamed government official, later revealed to be I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, Vice President Cheney's Chief of Staff, on July 8, 2003. Plame's CIA identity was divulged publicly in a column by conservative political commentator Robert Novak on July 14, 2003. Novak's source was revealed to have not been Libby, but Richard Armitage of the Department of State.\n\nOn July 16, 2005, \"The Washington Post\" reported that Miller could face criminal contempt charges, which could have extended her jail time six months beyond the four months then anticipated. The \"Post\" suggested that special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was particularly interested in hearing Miller's version of her encounter with Libby. Filings by Fitzgerald reportedly alleged that Miller's defiance of the court constituted a crime. On September 29, 2005, after spending 85 days in jail, Miller was released following a telephone call with Libby. He had reconfirmed the release of confidentiality. Under oath, Miller was questioned by Fitzgerald before a federal grand jury the following day, September 30, 2005, but was not relieved of contempt charges until after testifying again on October 12, 2005.\n\nFor her second grand jury appearance, Miller produced a notebook from a previously undisclosed meeting with Libby on June 23, 2003. This was several weeks \"before\" Joseph Wilson's \"New York Times\" editorial was published. This belied the theory that Libby was retaliating against Wilson for his \"Times\" editorial. According to Miller's notes from that earlier meeting, Libby disclosed that Joseph Wilson's wife was a CIA employee involved in her husband's trip to Niger. Miller's notebook from her July 8, 2003, meeting with Libby contains the name \"Valerie Flame [sic]\". This reference occurred six days before Novak published Plame's name and unmasked her as a CIA operative.\n\nMiller's grand jury account was the basis for her last article in the \"Times\". \"The New York Times\" published Miller's first-person account, \"My Four Hours Testifying in the Federal Grand Jury Room\", on October 16, 2005. Miller claimed she could not remember who gave her the name \"Valerie Plame\" but she was sure it didn't come from Libby.\n\nMiller testified as a witness on January 30, 2007, at the trial of Scooter Libby, which began in January 2007. The trial ended on March 6, 2007, with Libby's conviction on four of five counts, though none of the counts had to do with actually revealing Plame's name to the media.\n\nOn October 1, 2004, federal Judge Thomas F. Hogan found Miller in contempt of court for refusing to appear before a federal grand jury, which was investigating who had leaked to reporters the fact that Valerie Plame was a CIA operative. Miller did not write an article about the subject at the time of the leak, but others did, notably Robert Novak, spurring the investigation. Judge Hogan sentenced her to 18 months in jail, but stayed the sentence while her appeal proceeded. On February 15, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld Judge Hogan's ruling. On June 17, 2005, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case. On July 6, 2005, Judge Hogan ordered Miller to serve her sentence at \"a suitable jail within the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia\". She was taken to Alexandria City Jail on July 7, 2005.\n\nIn a separate case, Federal Judge Robert W. Sweet ruled on February 24, 2005, that Miller was not required to reveal who in the government leaked word of an impending raid to her. Patrick Fitzgerald, the same prosecutor who had had Miller jailed in the Plame case, argued that Miller's calls to groups suspected of funding terrorists had tipped them off to the raid and allowed them time to destroy evidence. Fitzgerald wanted Miller's phone records to confirm the time of the tip and determine who had leaked the information to Miller in the first place. Judge Sweet held that because Fitzgerald could not demonstrate in advance that the phone records would provide the information he sought the prosecutor's needs were outweighed by a 'reporter's privilege' to keep sources confidential. On August 1, 2006, a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Sweet's decision, holding 2–1 that federal prosecutors could inspect the telephone records of Miller and Philip Shenon. Judge Ralph K. Winter, Jr. wrote: \"No grand jury can make an informed decision to pursue the investigation further, much less to indict or not indict, without the reporters' evidence\".\n\nPrior to her jailing for civil contempt, Miller's lawyers argued that it was pointless to imprison her because she would never talk or reveal confidential sources. Under such circumstances, argued her lawyers, jail term would be \"merely punitive\" and would serve no purpose. Arguing that Miller should be confined to her home and could forego Internet access and cellphone use, Miller's lawyers suggested that \"impairing her unrestricted ability to do her job as an investigative journalist ... would present the strictest form of coercion to her\". Failing that, Miller's lawyers asked that she be sent to a women's facility in Danbury, Connecticut, nearer to \"Ms. Miller's 76-year-old husband\", retired book publisher Jason Epstein, who lives in New York City, and whose state of health was the subject of a confidential medical report filed by Miller's attorneys. Upon being jailed, the Times reported on July 7, 2005, that Miller had purchased a cockapoo puppy to keep her husband company during her absence.\n\nOn September 17, 2005, \"The Washington Post\" reported that Miller had received a \"parade of prominent government and media officials\" during her first 11 weeks in prison, including visits by former U.S. Republican Senator Bob Dole, NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, and John R. Bolton, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. After her release on September 29, 2005, Miller agreed to disclose to the grand jury the identity of her source, Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 30, 2007, Miller took the stand as a witness for the prosecution against Lewis Libby. Miller discussed three conversations she had had with Libby in June and July 2003, including the meeting on June 23, 2003. In her first appearance before the grand jury, Miller said she could not remember. According to \"The New York Times\", when asked if Libby discussed Valerie Plame, Miller responded in the affirmative, \"adding that Libby had said Wilson worked at the agency's (C.I.A.) division that dealt with limiting the proliferation of unconventional weapons\". The trial resulted in guilty verdicts against Libby.\n\nSince leaving \"The New York Times\", Miller has continued her work as a writer in Manhattan and has contributed several op-ed pieces to \"The Wall Street Journal\". On May 16, 2006, she summarized her investigations on U.S. foreign policy regarding Libya's dismantling of its weapons programs in an essay published in two parts.\n\nOn May 17, 2006, NavySEALs.com and MediaChannel.org published an exclusive interview with Miller in which she detailed how the attack on the U.S.S. \"Cole\" led her to investigate Al-Qaeda and, in July 2001, to her receiving information from a top-level White House source concerning top-secret NSA signals intelligence (SIGINT) about an impending Al-Qaeda attack, possibly against the continental United States. Two months later, on September 11, Miller and her editor at the \"Times\", Stephen Engelberg, both regretted not writing that story.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, she was hired as an adjunct fellow of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a neo-conservative free-market think tank. Her duties included being a contributing editor for the organization's publication, \"City Journal\". On October 20, 2008, Fox News announced that it had hired Miller.\n\nAs of 2018, she is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. She has also been a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, and has served on a prestigious National Academy of Sciences panel examining how best to expand of the work of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, which since 1991 has sought to stop the spread of WMD material and expertise from the former Soviet Union. She lectures frequently on the Middle East, Islam, terrorism, biological and chemical weapons, as well as other national security topics.\n\nOn April 3, 2015, \"The Wall Street Journal\" published an op-ed piece by Miller in which she defended her comportment during the lead-up to the war in Iraq, as well as the Bush administration's stance and decisions regarding the war. \"Officials [of the Bush administration] didn't lie, and I wasn't fed a line,\" she wrote. Miller acknowledged that \"there was no shortage of mistakes about Iraq, and I made my share of them. The newsworthy claims of some of my prewar WMD stories were wrong\", but rejected the notion that \"I took America to war in Iraq. It was all me\", which according to her \"continue[d] to have believers\".\n\nCritics subsequently wrote that \"Miller's war reporting was disastrously wrong, and now she's trying desperately to spin it all away,\". Valerie Plame commented that while \"no one is crediting [Miller] with starting the Iraq war,\" and she was \"not actually on the team that took us into the biggest, most tragic US foreign policy debacle ever..., [Miller's] attempt to re-write history is both pathetic and self-serving.\"\n\n\"The Guardian\" wrote that \"in arguing that Bush was a victim of faulty intelligence analysis, Miller ignores extensive reporting showing that the Bush administration was making plans for an Iraq invasion \"before\" the advent of intelligence used to justify it.\"\n\nOthers focused on what they termed as factual inaccuracies, such as Miller's claim that \"Hans Blix, the former chief of the international weapons inspectors, bears some responsibility [for the war]\" because he \"told the U.N. in January 2003 that despite America's ultimatum, Saddam was still not complying fully with his U.N. pledges.\" Her critics pointed out that, although Blix indeed reported that \"Iraq wasn't fully compliant,\" he also reported that Iraq was \"largely cooperative with regard to process,\" and, subsequently, \"made it abundantly clear, in an interview published in \"The New York Times\", that nothing he'd seen at the time justified war,\" an interview taken by Miller herself.\n\nIn April 2015, Miller published \"The Story: A Reporter's Journey\", a memoir that focused largely on her reporting during the second Gulf War. Her former colleague Neil Lewis characterized most of the reviews as \"unreservedly critical.\" Writing in \"The New York Times\", former \"Los Angeles Times\" reporter Terry McDermott wrote that although \"this is not a score-settling book,\" he found it \"sad and flawed\". Ιn \"The Washington Post\", Erik Wemple wrote that the book's \"dynamic\" of \"Judy Miller against the world\" lends her book an aspect that is \"both depressing and desperate\". A review in \"The Columbia Journalism Review\" called the book \"less a memoir than an apologia and an assault\". In \"The Daily Beast\", Lloyd Grove characterized Miller's work as \"self-pitying\". Criticizing Miller's failure to fully take responsibility for the flaws in her reporting, Matt Taibbi wrote in \"Rolling Stone\", \"Most of \"The Story\" is a tale of dog after scheming dog eating Miller's homework. ... Mostly, she just had a lot of rotten luck. Or at least, that's how it reads. It's a sweeping, epic non-apology. Every bad thing Miller has ever been accused of turns out to be wrong or taken out of context, according to her.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "99707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99707", "title": "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung", "text": "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung\n\nQuotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung () is a book of statements from speeches and writings by Mao Zedong (formerly romanized as Mao Tse-tung), the former Chairman of the Communist Party of China, published from 1964 to about 1976 and widely distributed during the Cultural Revolution.\nThe most popular versions were printed in small sizes that could be easily carried and were bound in bright red covers, becoming commonly known in the West as the Little Red Book.\n\n\"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung\" was originally compiled by an office of the \"PLA Daily\" (\"People's Liberation Army Daily\") as an inspirational political and military document. The initial publication covered 23 topics with 200 selected quotations by the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and was entitled \"200 Quotations from Chairman Mao\". It was first given to delegates of a conference on 5 January 1964 who were asked to comment on it. In response to the views of the deputies and compilers of the book, the work was expanded to address 25 topics with 267 quotations, and the title was changed simply to \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung\".\n\nOn 10 January, the work was re-issued to the delegates and sent to select units of the People's Liberation Army who received their advance copies for educating troops as well as for their comments. In May 1964, the PLA General Political Department, the chief political organ under Central Military Commission, revised \"Quotations\", adding a half title page with the slogan \"Workers of the world, unite!\" (全世界的无产阶级，联合起来！) in bold red letters, and endorsement leaves written by Lin Biao, Mao's chosen successor, that included three lines from the diary of revolutionary soldier Lei Feng who is considered a hero in China. This version was issued \"for internal use\" to the military leaders. Following discussions that expanded the book twice more—finally closing on 33 topics and 427 quotations by Mao—the commission began publishing the definitive version in May 1965.\nAt the end of 1965, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China officially approved the book for publication by the People's Publishing House and for distribution within China by the Xinhua Bookstore.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture held special study meetings to develop a production and distribution plan. It sought assurances that the book would receive publishing priority and that there would be sufficient paper, ink, and printing presses available. The goal was for \"ninety-nine percent (of the population of China to) read Chairman Mao's book\", according to a catalogue of publication records of the People's Publishing House. Provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across China were ordered to build hundreds of new printing houses to publish the \"Quotations\" during the second half of 1966 which pushed the limits of the Chinese printing industry.\n\nThis disrupted plans for publishing any new volumes of \"The Complete Works of Marx and Engels\" that was already in progress. It also halted distribution of other ideological works. As late as 1970, more than 8 million copies of the 4-volume set of \"Selected Works of Marx and Engels\" that had already been printed (both in cloth hardcover and paperback) remained undistributed in storage warehouses on the grounds that other works \"should not interfere with learning \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung\"\".\n\nOn the other hand, several other works by Mao had very large printings during the same period, even though these editions were not produced in the huge numbers of \"Quotations from Chairman Mao\". These include \"Selected Works of Mao Zedong\" (in four volumes, 2.875 million copies in 14 languages), \"Selected Articles of Mao Zedong\" (various editions totalling 252 million copies), single article books, and works of poetry.\n\nIn 1966, the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China approved \"Quotations from Chairman Mao\" for export. To meet overseas requirements, the editors of the Chinese Foreign Languages Press made revisions necessitated by the situation. They added a \"second edition preface\" endorsement by Lin Biao, dated 16 December 1966 (which was torn out following Lin Biao's death and public disgrace in September 1971). On the last page, they listed the names of the publisher (PLA General Political Department) without an ISBN, the printer and distributor (both Xinhua Bookstore), and the publication year.\n\nBy May 1967, bookstores in 117 countries and territories around the world – including Great Britain, France, Spain, Japan, the Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, Nepal, Indonesia, Burma, Iran, Arab and African nations and others – were distributing Mao's \"Quotations\". Foreign presses operating in 20 countries contributed to the publication of 20 translations in 35 versions.\n\nThe \"Little Red Book\" has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures. Some sources claim that over 6.5 billion printed volumes have been distributed in total, others contend that the distribution ran into the \"billions,\" and others cite \"over a billion\" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as \"untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations.\"\n\nThe book's popularity may be because it was essentially an unofficial requirement for every Chinese citizen to own, to read, and to carry it at all times during the latter half of Mao's rule, especially during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe most widely produced editions of the \"Quotations of Chairman Mao\" were published with a printed red vinyl cover wrapper over cardboard with pages bound in 64 folios that included colour photos of Mao. Other editions of the book were covered in cloth, silk, leather, paper, and other materials.\n\nMost editions were produced in a functional, compact size that fitted into a pocket, were easy to carry, and could be taken out at any time \"for practice, learning, application.\" It was published in 32 other common sizes, allegedly the largest format printed on only 4 pages as large as the newspaper \"Reference News\", and the smallest format the size of a matchbox.\n\nToday in China, the book is a symbol of Mao Zedong Thought. The tradition of the ritual chanting of slogans originated with Lin Biao, whom Mao Zedong met in the Red Guard. Among the best known is: \"Saying \"Wansui\" (literally: 10,000 years old) in their mouths, holding the Quotations (from Chairman Mao) in their hands!\" () which became a cliché of dogmatism or formalist irony.\nIn certain situations, the \"Quotations\" is given as a gift, for example, when public funds are involved, or when personal events arise, such as congratulating newlyweds, and so on.\n\nForeign press report called the work \"The Little Red Book\", reflecting its common small size and bright cover. After the Cultural Revolution ended, some Chinese people also adopted the nickname (back-translated into Chinese as \"The Treasured Red Book\") .\n\nDuring the 1960s, the book was the single most visible icon in mainland China, even more visible than the image of the Chairman himself. In posters and pictures created by CPC's propaganda artists, nearly every painted character, whether smiling or looking determined, was seen with a copy of the book in his or her hand. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the rise of Deng Xiaoping in 1978, the importance of the book waned considerably, and the glorification of Mao's quotations was considered to be left deviationism and a cult of personality.\n\nToday in China, the book \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung\" is mostly a piece of nostalgia. Various editions are popular with some collectors, and rare and unusual printings command extremely high prices. It may be purchased at shops in Beijing, Shanghai, other major cities in China, as well as at some tourist attractions.\n\n\"Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung\" consists of 427 quotations, organized thematically into 33 chapters. It is also called \"Thoughts of Chairman Mao\" by many Chinese people. The quotations range in length from a sentence to a few short paragraphs, and borrow heavily from a group of about two dozen documents in the four volumes of Mao's \"Selected Works\".\n\nIn the book's latter half, a strong empiricist tendency evidences itself in Mao's thought. Usually the quotations are arranged logically, to deal with one to three themes in the development of a chapter. The table below summarizes the book.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8894490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8894490", "title": "Resolvconf", "text": "Resolvconf\n\nIn some FreeBSD, Linux distributions, and other Unix-like operating systems, the resolvconf program maintains the system information about the currently available name servers and manages the contents of the configuration file \"resolv.conf\", which determines Domain Name System (DNS) resolver parameters.\n\nBefore a computer can connect to an external network resource by name, it must convert that alpha-numeric name (e.g., \"wikipedia.org\") into its corresponding network address called an IP address (e.g., \"66.230.200.10\"). The computer performs this conversion by contacting one of a number of special computers called name servers, which have tables of resource names and corresponding IP addresses. The information about the servers is kept in the configuration file \"resolv.conf\". However, when multiple programs need to dynamically modify the \"resolv.conf\" file, they can interfere with each other and store incorrect information in the file.\n\nThe \"resolvconf\" program addresses this problem. It acts as an intermediary between programs that supply name server information (e.g., DHCP clients) and programs that use name server information (e.g., resolvers). When \"resolvconf\" is properly installed, the \"resolv.conf\" file is replaced by a symbolic link to /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf and the resolver instead uses the dynamically generated linked file. In a system without resolvconf, the file is normally maintained manually or by a collection of scripts. The scripts may cause problems, because there is no program to control access to the file. Resolvconf controls access to the file, allowing many programs to use it at the same time.\n\nresolvconf cannot easily be disabled on some systems. On FreeBSD it can be disabled by placing resolvconf=NO in resolvconf.conf(5).\n\nIn securely administered environments the resolvconf program (or daemon, depending on the implementation) causes uneasiness since it interferes with the containment of resolv.conf security vulnerabilities, making changes to it without authorization. (Centralized change management, or centralized compliance, requires that system changes cannot be made from the sidelines.)\n\n"}

Scrivener provides a management system for documents, notes and metadata. This allows the user to organize notes, concepts, research and whole documents for easy access and reference (documents including rich text, images, PDF, audio, video, web pages, etc.). Scrivener offers templates for screenplays, fiction, and non-fiction manuscripts. After writing a text, the user may export it for final formatting to a standard word processor, screenwriting software, desktop publishing software, or TeX.\n\nFeatures include a corkboard, the ability to rearrange files by dragging-and-dropping virtual index cards on the corkboard, an outliner, a split screen mode that enables users to edit several documents at once, a full-screen mode, the ability to export text into multiple document formats (including popular e-book formats like EPUB and Mobipocket for Kindle, and markup languages such as Fountain, HTML, and MultiMarkdown), the ability to assign multiple keywords (and other metadata) to parts of a text and to sort the parts by keyword (such as characters, locations, themes, narrative lines, etc.), hyperlinks between parts of a text, and \"snapshots\" (the ability to save a copy of a particular document prior to any drastic changes).\n\nScrivener allows photos, URLs, and multiple other file formats, to be dragged into its interface as well. Because of its breadth of interfaces and features, it has positioned itself not only as a word processor, but as a project management tool for writers, and includes many user-interface features that resemble Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment (IDE). One computer programmer has called Scrivener \"an IDE for writing\".\n\nKeith Blount created, and continues to maintain, the program as a tool to help him write the \"big novel\", allowing him to keep track of ideas and research. It is built mostly on libraries and features of Mac OS X from version 10.4 onward. In 2011, a Windows version of the software was released, written and maintained by Lee Powell.\n\nScrivener for iOS was launched for iOS July 20, 2016.\n\nThere is no official release for Linux, but there is a public beta version which has been abandoned.\n\nThe latest version of Scrivener for Mac is version 3.0, and requires macOS Sierra or newer. Scrivener can be obtained from the Mac App Store, but since the Mac App Store application is only usable on OS X 10.6.6 and later, users of earlier versions of OS X must buy it directly from the developer's website instead of the Mac App Store.\n\nThe company also makes Scrivener 2.5 available for earlier version of Mac OS X, but claims it is the final version of the software that was built to run on both PowerPC and Intel systems running Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.8. This version is available on the direct sale page in the sidebar titled \"Mac OS X 10.4–8 and PowerPC\".\n\nIn addition to the Scrivener version 2 releases, the direct download page provides access to the obsolete version 1.54, but licenses are no longer available for purchase.

A subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain; the only domain that is not also a subdomain is the root domain. For example, codice_1 and codice_2 are subdomains of the codice_3 domain, which in turn is a subdomain of the codice_4 top-level domain (TLD).\nA \"subdomain\" expresses relative dependence, not absolute dependence: for example, codice_5 comprises a subdomain of the codice_6 domain, and codice_7 comprises a subdomain of the domain codice_5. In theory this subdivision can go 127 levels deep (though that limit is not in any published RFC). Per RFC 1035, each DNS label can contain up to 63 characters, as long as the whole domain name does not exceed a total length of 255 characters, but in practice most domain registries limit at 253 characters.\n\nSubdomains in this context are defined by editing the DNS zone file pertaining to the parent domain. However, there is an ongoing debate over the use of the term “subdomain” when referring to names which map to the Address record A (host) and various other types of zone records which may map to any public IP address destination and any type of server. Certain groups insist that it is inappropriate to use the term “subdomain” to refer to any mapping other than that provided by zone NS (name server) records and any server-destination other than that\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the third-level domain names are standard and branch off from the second-level domains. For example:\n\n\nSubdomains are also used by organizations that wish to assign a unique name to a particular department, function, or service related to the organization. For example, a university might assign \"cs\" to the computer science department, such that a number of hosts could be used inside that subdomain, such as codice_9 or codice_10.\n\nA vanity domain is a subdomain of an ISP's domain that is aliased to an individual user account, or a subdomain that expresses the individuality of the person on whose behalf it is registered.\n\nDepending on application, a record inside a domain, or subdomain might refer to a hostname, or a service provided by a number of machines in a cluster. Some websites use different subdomains to point to different server clusters. For example, codice_11 points to Server Cluster 1 or Datacentre 1, and codice_12 points to Server Cluster 2 or Datacentre 2 etc..\n\nSome domains host their nameservers as ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com, etc., and these do not typically show up in search engine results.\n\nSubdomains are different from directories. For example, example.com/yn points to a directory within the example.com domain, not to a subdomain of example.com.\n\n"}

Once they ran out of the lower priced product the stores began to replace it with the regularly priced stock. The manager failed to take the signs down and a customer was charged at the higher price.

In its defence Tesco argued that the company had taken all reasonable precautions and all due diligence, and that the conduct of the manager could not attach liability to the corporation.\n\nThe House of Lords accepted the defence and found that the manager was not a part of the \"directing mind\" of the corporation and therefore his conduct was not attributable to the corporation.

In a career that spanned from the 1950s into the 1970s, he garnered several world championships.\n\nWeiczorkiewicz was born in 1926 in Roanne, Loire, France to a Russian father and a Polish mother. He joined the French resistance during World War II under the German occupation and was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Croix du combattant medals by the French government at the close of the war. He moved to Montreal, Québec in 1956 and became a Canadian citizen. He also became an all around athlete with gymnastic skills.\n\nCarpentier was a crowd favourite, one of the first wrestlers to delight fans with acrobatic leaps from the turnbuckles and a variety of other aerial manoeuvres such as the rope-aided twisting headscissors. He was always a fan favourite in his bouts and was matched against numerous villains, perhaps the most well known of whom was the legendary Killer Kowalski.\n\nThe highpoint of his career was his NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign from 1956 to 1957. He won the title in a disputed contest against Lou Thesz on 14 June 1957. Some NWA territories and officials recognized the disputed win as a legitimate title change, while others did not. This led to the split of the NWA and led to the creation of the American Wrestling Association and other organizations, all with their own world titles. He was later recognized as the first holder of the AWA's Omaha version of the World Heavyweight Championship. He eventually dropped the belt to Verne Gagne.\n\nCarpentier headlined Madison Square Garden three times in 1962 with tag team partner Bobo Brazil. They had two main events against Buddy Rogers & Handsome Johnny Barend; another against Rogers & Killer Kowalski. He teamed numerous times with Antonino Rocca, as well as with Vittorio Apollo. In solo matches at the Garden, he defeated Giant Baba, Skull Murphy, Magnificent Maurice, and Hans Mortier.\n\nAfter his retirement, Carpentier operated a school for teaching professional wrestling skills. He also operated in the early 1980s as a babyface colour commentator, alongside heel play-by-play host Guy Hauray, for the Montreal-based Grand Prix Wrestling, and then, together for the World Wrestling Federation, when the WWF bought the Montreal territory in 1985. They hosted the French edition of the WWF television show \"Superstars\", sold to French-speaking countries. He was replaced by former Québécois wrestler Raymond Rougeau in 1992.\n\nOn 30 October 2010, Carpentier died of a heart attack at his home in Montreal, aged 84. He had also suffered a heart attack in 2000. Carpentier had been in poor health for many years, battered from his acrobatic, high-flying style.\n\n\n"}

This is reportedly the first commercial featuring Atatürk.\n\nThe commercial features a dialogue between a young boy and Atatürk working in a rose garden. A thorn pricks Atatürk's finger. The boy asks how a thorn \"can\" prick Atatürk's hand. Atatürk replies with the question: \"can it not prick?\" The boy further asks how Atatürk's hand \"can\" bleed. Atatürk replies with the question: \"can it not bleed?\" Shocked, the boy inquires whether he isn't Atatürk? Atatürk replies that he is indeed Atatürk. The boy, still shocked, replies \"but...\". Atatürk interrupts and explains that if one is going to grow a rose, one will suffer pain, one's hand will bleed, sun will make one sweat, there will be people putting to the gardener that the roses in the garden will never die, and that there will be people confronting the gardener on how a rose is supposed to be grown. Atatürk continues by saying that the boy should be asking him just one question: \"Do I want to make this place a rose garden? Do I want to grow the world's most beautiful roses in this garden?\" Atatürk further adds that if the boy really wishes it to be so, \"he wouldn't care about neither the thorns that prick nor the words said\". Atatürk continues by saying that whoever it might be, all he would care about is the scent of the rose garden. Atatürk concludes by asking, whether the boy understood the lesson and the boy acknowledges this. The commercial concludes with the statement \"We respectfully commemorate Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of our country and bank\".\n\nThe commercial was directed by Gürkan Kurtkaya and was shot in black and white giving it a historic feel with the slogan \"the roses you have grown are mourning\" (). The preparations for the commercial lasted three weeks. The actual filming itself lasted 3 days. A technical team made out of 50 people took part in the filming. For the details of the era, Rıdvan Akar was consulted.\n\nThe role of the boy was acted by Hakan Büyüktopçu and the role of Atatürk was acted by Haluk Bilginer. Prior to the shooting, Haluk Bilginer received a natural make-up lasting hours. Including the test shootings, Bilginer spent a total of 40 hours in the make-up room. The make-up work was conducted by Vittorio Sodano and his team. For one week, the make-up team worked in Italy for preparations and worked for another week in the set during the shootings. To convert Bilginer's face to Atatürk, first a cast was made of his face. Hair and eyebrow pieces that were prepared in Italy were put in their places by Suzan Kardeş after a 2-day worth work on them. The costumes were based on a photo from June 21, 1936 of Atatürk. Designer Nalan Türkoğlu and her team of six people created ten costumes in one week.\n\nTo find a suitable location for the take representing the features of the era, three separate teams searched İstanbul, Edirne, Bursa, İzmir, and Antalya. Finally Paşabahçe was the location agreement concluded with. A special set was made for the filming, and the take of the 107-second commercial started in the morning and lasted till later that night. After each take, Bilginer went behind camera and had inspected each plan.\n\nThe resemblance of Haluk Bilginer to Atatürk featured heavily in the comments by reviewers. Acting in the role of Atatürk for the first time, Bilginer himself stated that he was honored by the role and that he was very excited about getting to play it.\n\nThe commercial also established a candidate for the debated role of Atatürk in the upcoming movie on Atatürk. Kevin Costner, who was in Turkey for a concert, declined this post, reportedly asking whether there wasn't a Turkish actor for the role. The commercial portraying Turkey as a rose garden also demonstrates the difficulties Atatürk coped with in founding the republic and his reforms.\n"}
