The building had been in development since 2006, and construction began in late 2014. It was topped out in April 2018. , 53W53 is the seventh-tallest building in the city.\n\nThe building, designed by Jean Nouvel, initially was proposed to stand 1,250 feet (381 m) tall (the same height as the Empire State Building below its mast). The mid-block building had run into considerable opposition focusing on fears that it would cast a shadow over Central Park during the winter and that its mid-block location would create traffic problems. Financing had been scarce until October 2013, when the Kwee brothers' Pontiac Land agreed to provide $200 million in equity, supported by an $860 million loan from a consortium of Asian banks.\n\nThe building bought air rights from the University Club of New York and St. Thomas Church. On September 9, 2009, the New York City Planning Commission said the building could be built if were clipped off the top. The City's decision not to approve Tower Verre as proposed was greeted with disappointment and derision by several prominent architecture critics.\nThe version was approved by the City Council on October 28, 2009 in a 44-3 vote.\n\nThe building's skin would contain a faceted exterior that tapers to a set of crystalline peaks at the apex of the tower Due to this, the project is said to be one of the most exciting additions to New York's skyline in a generation. MoMA, which owned the building's lot and completed a renovation in 2005, sold the lot to Hines for $125 million in 2007. In September 2014, the air rights were purchased from MOMA and the building became known as 53W53.\n\nPontiac Land Group and Goldman Sachs are the development partners for Hines on the building, and together they secured an $860 million construction loan from a consortium of Asian Banks led by United Overseas Bank Limited. The building is 82-story, 145-unit tower. In addition to the MOMA, the air rights were purchased from the St. Thomas Church for $71 million. The building's total floor area will be approximately , and condominiums in the building are designed by Thierry Despont. As of July 2016, construction management company Lend Lease had completed excavation and foundation work with superstructure concrete up to the 8th floor.\n\nThe building will be mixed-use, with gallery space, condominiums, and a private restaurant. There will be 145 residences, from one to five bedroom options. One bedroom residences will begin at $3 million and the top floor duplex penthouse is priced at over $80 million.\n\nResidents will be given special privileges at MoMA, including unlimited free admission to the museum, exhibition previews, discounts in MoMA stores, and access to film screenings. The building will also include a private formal dining room, priority access to an in-building restaurant, a library with a fireplace, a children's playroom, a wine tasting room and a lounge with Central Park views available for events. Services available for a fee will include a pantry stocking service, a housekeeping service, and pet walking.\n\n\n"}

The entries span from the Deluge, dated as 2,242 years after creation to AD 1616.\n\nDue to the criticisms by Irish historian Tuileagna Ó Maol Chonaire, the text was not published in the lifetime of any of the participants.\n\nThe annals are mainly a compilation of earlier annals, although there is some original work. They were compiled between 1632 and 1636 at a Franciscan friary near the Drowes river in County Leitrim, on the border with County Donegal and County Sligo. The patron of the project was Fearghal Ó Gadhra, M.P., a Gaelic lord in Coolavin, County Sligo.\n\nThe chief compiler of the annals was Brother Mícheál Ó Cléirigh from Ballyshannon, who was assisted by, among others, Cú Choigcríche Ó Cléirigh, Fearfeasa Ó Maol Chonaire and Peregrine Ó Duibhgeannain. Although only one of the authors, Mícheál Ó Cléirigh, was a Franciscan friar, they became known as 'The Four Friars' or in the original Irish, \"Na Ceithre Máistrí\". The Anglicized version of this was \"The Four Masters\", the name that has become associated with the annals themselves.\n\nThe annals are written in Irish. The several manuscript copies are held at Trinity College Dublin, the Royal Irish Academy, University College Dublin and the National Library of Ireland.\n\nThe first substantial English translation (starting at AD 1171) was published by Owen Connellan in 1846. The Connellan translation included the annals from the eleventh to the seventeenth centuries. The only version to have a four-colour frontispiece, it included a large folding map showing the location of families in Ireland. This edition, neglected for over 150 years, was republished in the early twenty-first century. The original Connellan translation was followed several years later by a full translation by the historian John O'Donovan. The translation was funded by a government grant of £1,000 obtained by the notable mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton while he was president of the Royal Irish Academy.\n\nThe Annals are one of the principal Irish-language sources for Irish history up to 1616. While many of the early chapters are essentially lists of names and dates, the later chapters, dealing with events of which the authors had first-hand accounts, are much more detailed.\n\nThe reliability and usefulness of the \"Annals\" as a historical source has sometimes been questioned on the grounds that they were limited to accounts of the births, deaths and activities of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland and often ignore wider social trends or events.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"Annals\", as one of the few prose sources in Irish from this period, also provide a valuable insight into events such as the Desmond Rebellions and the Nine Years War from a Gaelic Irish perspective.\n\nThe early part of this work is based upon the Lebor Gabala. Today, most scholars regard the Lebor Gabála as primarily myth rather than history. It appears to be mostly based on medieval Christian pseudo-histories, but it also incorporates some of Ireland's native pagan mythology. Scholars believe the goal of its writers was to provide an epic history for Ireland that could compare to that of the Israelites or the Romans, and which reconciled native myth with the Christian view of history.] It is suggested, for example, that there are six 'takings' to match the \"Six Ages of the World\" Lebor Gabála Érenn is also considered a \"highly influential Middle Irish prose-and-verse treatise [...] written in order to bridge the chasm between Christian world-chronology and the prehistory of Ireland\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Even though the round carries less explosive than a 60mm mortar shell, this is thought to be counterbalanced by its much higher volume of fire.\n\nThe most popular caliber for automatic grenade launchers in the west has been 40mm. The Soviet Union successfully fielded a 30mm grenade launcher, the AGS-17 during its war in Afghanistan, in 2002, Russia introduced a successor weapon, the AGS-30, and in 2017, AGS-40 Balkan. Traditional munitions for automatic grenade launchers include high explosive, fragmentation, and shaped charge for attacking light armored vehicles. Less lethal rounds, like tear gas and sponge rounds, for crowd control, have also been made. In the 21st century, AGLs have been made with integrated sight/range systems which can set a fused round to detonate precisely on, above, or behind a designated target. \n\nDifferent weapons use different methods of operation, with \"blowback\" and \"long recoil\" being two popular choices. In all these weapons the energy released by firing a round loads the next round into the weapon's breech. The popular Mark 19 is automatically reloaded through the blowback method, where expanding gases blow back the firing bolt.\n\nIn the long recoil method the bolt is fixed to the firing chamber, and the whole firing chamber is blown back. These weapons are slightly less accurate, but weigh less than blowback weapons.\nGeneral Dynamics manufactures a long recoil weapon, the Mark 47 Automatic Grenade Launcher, as does the Spanish firm Santa Bárbara. The LAG-40 manufactured by Santa Bárbara has a relatively low rate of fire -- 215 rounds per minute.\n\n"}

It is an annually published collection of quality standards for UK medicinal substances. It is used by individuals and organisations involved in pharmaceutical research, development, manufacture and testing.\n\nPharmacopoeial standards are publicly available and legally enforceable standards of quality for medicinal products and their constituents. The \"British Pharmacopoeia\" is an important statutory component in the control of medicines which complements and assists the licensing and inspection processes of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the United Kingdom. Together with the \"British National Formulary\" (BNF), the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" defines the UK's pharmaceutical standards.\n\nPharmacopoeial standards are compliance requirements; that is, they provide the means for an independent judgement as to the overall quality of an article, and apply throughout the shelf-life of a product. Inclusion of a substance in a pharmacopoeia does not indicate that it is either safe or effective for the treatment of any disease.\n\nThe \"British Pharmacopoeia\" is published on behalf of the Health Ministers of the United Kingdom; on the recommendation of the Commission on Human Medicines, in accordance with section 99(6) of the Medicines Act 1968, and notified in draft to the European Commission (EC) in accordance with Directive 98/34/EEC.\n\nThe monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia (as amended by Supplements published by the Council of Europe) are reproduced either in the \"British Pharmacopoeia\", or in the associated edition of the \"British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary)\".\n\nIn the pharmacopoeia, certain drugs and preparations are included regardless of the existence of actual or potential patent rights. Where substances are protected by letters patent, their inclusion in the pharmacopoeia neither conveys, nor implies, license to manufacture.\n\nThe regulation of medicinal products by officials in the United Kingdom dates back to the reign of King Henry VIII (1491–1547). The Royal College of Physicians of London had the power to inspect apothecaries’ products in the London area, and to destroy defective stock. The first list of approved drugs, with information on how they should be prepared, was the \"London Pharmacopoeia\", published in 1618. The first edition of what is now known as the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" was published in 1864, and was one of the first attempts to harmonise pharmaceutical standards, through the merger of the \"London\", \"Edinburgh\" and \"Dublin Pharmacopoeias\". The New Latin name that had some currency at the time was \"Pharmacopoeia Britannica\" (Ph. Br.).\n\nA commission was first appointed by the General Medical Council (GMC), when the body was made statutorily responsible under the Medical Act 1858 for producing a British pharmacopoeia on a national basis. In 1907, the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" was supplemented by the \"British Pharmaceutical Codex\", which gave information on drugs and other pharmaceutical substances not included in the \"BP\", and provided standards for these.\n\nThe Medicines Act 1968 established the legal status of the British Pharmacopoeia Commission, and of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\", as the UK standard for medicinal products under section 4 of the Act. The British Pharmacopoeia Commission continues the work of the earlier Commissions appointed by the GMC, and is responsible for preparing new editions of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" and the \"British Pharmacopoeia (Veterinary)\", and for keeping them up to date. Under Section 100 of the Medicines Act, the British Pharmacopoeia Commission is also responsible for selecting and devising British Approved Names (BANs )(see #British Approved Names).\n\nSince its first publication back in 1864, the distribution of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" has grown throughout the world. It is now used in over 100 countries. Australia and Canada are two of the countries that have adopted the \"BP\" as their national standard alongside the UK; in other countries, e.g. South Korea, the \"BP\" is recognised as an acceptable reference standard.\n\nThe current edition of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" comprises six volumes, which contain nearly 3,000 monographs for drug substances, excipients, and formulated preparation, together with supporting general notices, appendices (test methods, reagents etc.), and reference spectra, used in the practice of medicine, all comprehensively indexed and cross-referenced for easy reference. Items used exclusively in veterinary medicine in the UK are included in the \"BP (Veterinary)\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"British Pharmacopoeia\" is available as a printed volume and electronically in both on-line and CD-ROM versions; the electronic products use sophisticated search techniques to locate information quickly. For example, pharmacists referring to a monograph can immediately link to other related substances and appendices referenced in the content by using 130,000+ hypertext links within the text.\n\nThe \"British Pharmacopoeia\" is prepared by the Pharmacopoeial Secretariat, working in collaboration with the British Pharmacopoeia Laboratory, the British Pharmacopoeia Commission (BPC), and its Expert Advisory Groups (EAG) and Advisory Panels. The development of pharmacopoeial standards receives input from relevant industries, hospitals, academia, professional bodies and governmental sources, both within and outside the UK.\n\nThe British Pharmacopoeia Laboratory provides analytical and technical support to the \"British Pharmacopoeia\". Its major functions are:\n\nThe current edition of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\" is available from The Stationery Office Bookshop.\n\nDetailed information and guidance on various aspects of current pharmacopoeial policy and practice is provided in supplementary chapters of the \"British Pharmacopoeia\". This includes explanation of the basis of pharmacopoeial specifications, and information on the development of monographs including guidance to manufacturers.\n\nBritish Approved Names (BANs) are devised or selected by the British Pharmacopoeia Commission (BPC), and published by the Health Ministers, on the recommendation of the Commission on Human Medicines, to provide a list of names of substances or articles referred to in Section 100 of the Medicines Act 1968. BANs are short, distinctive names, for substances; where the systematic chemical or other scientific names are too complex for convenient general use.\n\nAs a consequence of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, the British Approved Names, since 2002, may be assumed to be the recommended International Non-proprietary Name (rINN), except where otherwise stated. A World Health Organization (WHO) INN identifies a pharmaceutical substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient by a unique name that is globally recognised, and in which no party can claim any proprietary rights. A non-proprietary name is also known as a generic name.\n\nThere are equivalent pharmacopoeia in many other countries, such as U.S. (the \"United States Pharmacopoeia\"), Japan (\"Japanese Pharmacopoeia\"), and China (\"Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China\"), and the World Health Organization maintains \"The International Pharmacopoeia\".\n\nThe \"British National Formulary\" (BNF) and its related publications contains information on prescribing, indications, side effects and costs of all medication drugs available on the National Health Service (NHS).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3947899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3947899", "title": "Byron Edmund Walker", "text": "Byron Edmund Walker\n\nSir Byron Edmund Walker, CVO (14 October 1848 – 27 March 1924) was a Canadian banker. He was the president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce from 1907 to 1924, and a generous patron of the arts, helping to found and nurture many of Canada's cultural and educational institutions, including the University of Toronto, National Gallery of Canada, the Champlain Society, Appleby College, Art Gallery of Ontario and Royal Ontario Museum.\n\nIn 1910, King George V knighted Walker for his contributions to business and the arts.\n\nByron Edmund Walker was born on 14 October 1848 on the outskirts of Caledonia in Seneca Township, Haldimand County, Canada West.\n\nHis grandfather, Thomas Walker, had been a manufacturer of watchcases in London, England. He arrived in Upper Canada (now Ontario) in 1834 with four of his children, some books and some pictures. The loss of his wife and four of his children contributed heavily to his decision to leave London for Canada. The third youngest child was Alfred Edmund Walker, Sir Edmund's father, a farmer who became a clerk. He was also an amateur naturalist, paleontologist and watercolour painter. Alfred Edmund married Fanny Murton of Hamilton in 1845. Fanny's parents also were immigrants from England, having arrived in 1832. Her father, William Murton, was college educated and her mother spoke Italian and French and played the harpsichord. She also ran a private junior school in Hamilton.\n\nThe Walkers had nine children of which Byron Edmund (or Edmund, as he preferred to be called) was the second oldest. The family moved from their farm near Caledonia, to Hamilton in 1852. There, at the age of four, Edmund began studies at his grandmother's school and then at the Hamilton Central School where he completed all six grades. He hoped to pursue a teaching career but poor health curtailed his enrollment in the Toronto Normal School, the teacher's college founded by Egerton Ryerson in 1851. At the age of 12, Walker entered the service of his uncle, John Walter Murton, who had a currency exchange business in Hamilton.\n\nWhile working at his uncle's \"bureau de change\", Walker became an expert in recognizing counterfeit bills being circulated during the American Civil War. After seven years at his uncle's firm, he spent a few months in Montreal but poor health forced him to return to Hamilton in 1868 where he began work as a discount clerk in the newly opened Canadian Bank of Commerce.\n\nThe Canadian Bank of Commerce was established by industrialist William McMaster in 1867. McMaster would serve as a guiding light to the young Edmund, who quickly rose through the ranks. In 1872, he was appointed chief accountant at the bank's head office in Toronto. In May 1873, Walker was sent to New York City as junior agent for the bank. Charged with responsibility for loans of gold against currency, he successfully maintained proper margins in spite of his clients' many sudden bankruptcies. The enterprising Walker was then sent to the bank's Windsor branch in 1875. In 1878, he was appointed manager of the London, Ontario branch, a year later was made inspector of the bank, and in 1880 he returned to Hamilton as manager.\n\nWalker married Mary Alexander in 1874 while living in New York. Together they had four sons and three daughters. She was the daughter of Alexander Alexander, a carpenter who emigrated from Scotland to Lockport, New York, in 1834. That year, he married Isabella Buchan and moved to Hamilton, Ontario, where he became a green grocer. Together they had five children.\n\nFrom 1881 to 1886, Edmund was again in New York as the bank's joint agent, giving him the opportunity to increase his talents in foreign exchange and to conduct international banking on a much larger scale. There he could expand his cultural interests, visiting galleries and museums, and beginning, in earnest, his art collection. In 1886, at age 38, Walker was recalled to Toronto as general manager of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. By then there were 30 branches in Ontario and agencies in Toronto, Montreal and New York. The bank's assets at its inception were $2,997,081; 50 years later, these were $440,310,703 with branches across the country, largely attributable to Walker's strong leadership.\n\nWalker is known for developing the first set of written regulations for dividing a bank into a complex array of departments and is widely credited for the Canadian government's 1881/82 revision of the \"Canada Banking Act\" that gave Canada a centralized, panic-proof banking system. Walker was also professionally respected internationally. As vice-president of the American Bankers Association he was invited by a U.S. congressional committee to advise on the drafting of the Federal Reserve legislation. He held many key national and international positions; chairman of the bankers' section of the Toronto Board of Trade from 1891–92; vice-president of the Canadian Bankers Association (which he helped found in 1891) in 1893 and its president from 1894–95; chairman of the 1899 Royal Commission on the financial position of the province of Ontario; and chairman of the Section of Money and Credit for the 1904 Universal Exposition in St. Louis. He was a fellow of the Institute of Bankers of England and fellow of the Royal Economic Society of England.\n\nIn 1906, he was elected director of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. He served as president from 1907 until his death in 1924.\n\nThe Liberal Party government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed Walker to the National Battlefields Commission in 1908. The commission was charged with the recovery of non-Crown land for a \"Battlefields Park\" in Quebec City where the Battle of the Plains of Abraham was fought between French and British forces. The commission was also charged with supervision of the expenditures of the Tercentenary Celebration of Samuel de Champlain founding Quebec in 1608. Later, Walker was made chairman of the Canadian committee of the Peace Centenary, an event planned by the Canadian, American and British governments to commemorate 100 years of peace between Canada and the United States following the War of 1812-14.\n\nAlthough Walker tried to stay out of active politics all his life and never joined a political party, he decided to take a pivotal role in the political arena with a group of 18 prominent businessmen who opposed the Reciprocity Agreement with the United States proposed by the Laurier government. Walker feared that the giant American trusts, once allowed into Canada, would paralyze the Canadian market. Furthermore, as an ardent patriot and staunch imperialist, he feared it would weaken Canada's ties with Britain and lead to annexation by the United States. The anti-reciprocity forces led to the defeat of Laurier's government in 1911. Walker was among those who advised the new Conservative Party prime minister, Sir Robert Borden, on preserving the financial stability of Canada during the First World War.\n\nWalker credited his father for developing his broad interests and love for learning, and always regretted that poor health prevented him from getting a formal education. He believed that the basis of a civilized society was its educational system and that a nation's universities were its most treasured institutions. Throughout his life he took an active interest in educational institutions. One of the first and most lasting of his interests was the University of Toronto. In 1887, the denominational institutions of Victoria College (Methodist), Knox College (Presbyterian), Wycliffe College (Anglican theological school), and St. Michael's College (Roman Catholic) had entered into a federation with the secular University College, the only one funded by the government. After fire destroyed the eastern portion of University College in 1890, Walker was instrumental in persuading the Ontario government to make its first grant to the amalgamated University of Toronto.\n\nHe was also responsible for leading the last denominational college - Trinity College, affiliated with the Church of England - into the federation in 1904. Trinity awarded him a Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) that same year. In 1905, he was a member of the Royal Commission on the reorganization of the university, which was responsible for securing annual government grants thereafter. Over the course of his 32-year involvement with the university, Walker served as trustee (1892–1906), senator (1893–1901), member of the Board of Governors (1906–10), chairman (1910–23) and chancellor (1923–24).\n\nThe Toronto Conservatory of Music also joined the university through his efforts. He served as a member of its Board of Governors, and later as president (1917–24). His support for music also included the Mendelssohn Choir, for which he was honorary president (1900–24).\n\nWith a lasting commitment to education and the importance of Canadian history in nurturing patriotism and a Canadian identity, he founded the Champlain Society in 1905. Established as a non-profit organization, its mandate was to publish important documents relating to Canadian history, projects that commercial publishers would consider unprofitable. He believed that this Society was his finest achievement. He served as its president until his death.\n\nAs an author of articles on a variety of subjects - banking, Robert Browning, Italian and Japanese art - it is not surprising that Walker would be one of the founders of the Canadian Society of Authors, established to promote Canadian literature and protect authors with copyright laws. Walker served as president from 1904-09.\n\nIn 1911, Walker established Appleby School, a boys' private boarding school, for which he purchased the initial property in Oakville. The first headmaster of the school was Walker's son-in-law John Guest.\n\nThrough his years in New York City and early trips to Europe - including to London in 1887 and Italy in 1892 - Walker developed skills as an art connoisseur and collector, often lecturing on the subject. His collection of art was housed in his Toronto residence - \"Long Garth\" at 99 St. George Street. The Victorian brick structure had fine wood interiors, Art Nouveau ceiling decorations by Gustav Hahn, and allegorical murals by George Agnew Reid. \"Long Garth\" became a treasure trove of etchings, prints, embroideries and oriental carpets, bronzes, brass and ivory work, porcelain china, not to mention his fossil collection and his extensive library. Walker had a particular fascination with printmaking and it was said that his expert eye for detail in detecting counterfeit banknotes aided his connoisseurship. Walker also was a member of the Japan Society of America and the most notable part of his collection, 1,070 Japanese woodblock prints, were bequeathed to the Royal Ontario Museum on his death. Equally of note is the collection of over 400 works of graphic art, ranging from the 15th to the 9th centuries, which he assembled between 1880 and 1924, including works by Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt. His children gave the collection to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1926.\n\nBeyond purchasing some pictures by Canadian artists, Walker's first real connection with the Canadian art world began when he was approached by a number of prominent Toronto artists to help them organize a guild. With these like-minded laymen and artists who shared his ideals he formed the Toronto Guild of Civic Art. Spearheaded by George Agnew Reid, the guild pressed for civic improvements in the city. Walker served as its first president in 1897. As the Guild's representative on the committee to select the artist for the monument to Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe at Queen's Park, Walker was largely responsible for the commission being awarded to sculptor Walter Seymour Allward. Later, Walker was responsible for Allward's commissions to design the South African War Memorial on University Avenue in Toronto, as well as the Bell Telephone Memorial in Brantford.\n\nWalker's relationship with George Agnew Reid led to the founding of the Art Gallery of Ontario. On 15 March 1900, Reid, then president of the Ontario Society of Artists, brought a group of citizens together to consider the formation of an art gallery for Toronto. At that meeting, a Provisional Art Museum Board was set in place with Walker as chairman and Reid as secretary. Through effective lobbying and fundraising ($5,000 each from 10 benefactors), the Ontario Legislature later that year passed a bill incorporating the Art Museum of Toronto. Walker became president of its Board of Trustees and served until his death.\n\nThe initial challenge was to find a home for the new institution. It was Walker who convinced his friends, writer Dr. Goldwin Smith and his wife, the former Mrs. William Henry Boulton, to leave their historic house, \"The Grange,\" to the new museum. Before the news became public, Walker bought surrounding land so that the museum would have space for future expansion. The Art Museum of Toronto (later renamed the Art Gallery of Toronto and then the Art Gallery of Ontario) officially opened its first galleries in The Grange in April 1913. In 1926, two years after his death, when the gallery was expanding, the Canadian Bank of Commerce donated the funds to build the magnificent room that bears his name, the \"Walker Court\".\n\nThe campaign for a world-class public museum for Toronto was led by Walker, philanthropist Sir Edmund Boyd Osler, then director of the Canadian Pacific Railway and president of The Dominion Bank, and Dr. Charles Trick Currelly, the first curator of the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology. An archaeologist, Currelly had been doing fieldwork in Egypt, Crete and Asia Minor for the purpose of collecting artifacts as a core collection for the small museum he established at Victoria College in 1907. But he wanted a larger museum for the university and others soon became involved. Walker, Osler and others provided funds and solicited financial support from the government.\n\nTogether, Osler and Walker created an organizational structure for the museum, including how funding was to be shared between the university and the government. In 1912, the \"Royal Ontario Museum Act\" was passed. A Board of Trustees was created, with appointments shared equally by university and government. Walker was its first chairman.\n\nThe Royal Ontario Museum opened on 19 March 1914. Currelly became director in 1914 until his retirement in 1946 and Walker remained chairman of the Board of Trustees until his death. In the ensuing years he contributed financially, and assisted through generous lines of credit from the Canadian Bank of Commerce, notably for Currelly's substantial acquisitions of Chinese artifacts. Walker's fossil collection became the nucleus of the museum's paleontology collection, and resulted in a dinosaur, \"Parasaurolophus walkeri\", being named after him in 1922. His interest and support of paleontology had led to an earlier association with the Royal Canadian Institute, another scientific institution of which he was president from 1898-1900.\n\nAt the first official exhibition of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts on 6 March 1880, Canada's Governor General, the Marquis of Lorne, established the National Gallery of Canada at the Clarendon Hotel in Ottawa. An Advisory Arts Council was formed in 1907 and consisted of Sir George Drummond, president of the Bank of Montreal, as chairman; the senator from Montreal, Arthur Boyer, as secretary; and Sir Edmund Walker, then just newly appointed president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, as member. The council was charged with advising the government on architecture and decoration of public buildings and public monuments. It was responsible for selecting and purchasing artworks for the collection. Drummond favoured the acquisition of European works while Walker was adamant that Canadian art be included. On Drummond's death in 1909, Walker became chairman of the council. Walker's influence as a print collector was crucial in launching the gallery's Prints and Drawings Department, which opened in 1911.\n\nAnother responsibility of the council was to advise on the Victoria Memorial Museum (Ottawa's present Natural History Museum), which opened in 1913. The same year the \"National Gallery of Canada Act\" was passed with an independent Board of Trustees constituted; Walker was appointed chairman and served until his death. Its trustees were charged, among other duties, with the development, encouragement and cultivation of \"correct artistic taste in the fine arts.\" By 1924, this collection had over 4,000 items.\n\nWalker was key in the creation of what today is the collection of First World War \"war pictures\" now housed in the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa. In 1915, the Canadian financier and expatriate, William Maxwell Aitken (later Baron Beaverbrook), was appointed the Canadian force's official records officer in England. Beaverbrook established the Canadian War Memorials Fund to record for posterity the events of that war. As both a member of the fund's committee and chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery, Walker insisted that the commissioned artists include Canadians, as well as the British artists Beaverbook proposed. By 1918, a large number of Canadian artists, among them A.Y. Jackson and Frederick Varley, were in Europe sketching munitions factories and various theatres of operations where Canadians were active. Other artists, C.W. Jefferys among them, recorded the war effort at home in Canada. In 1921, the Beaverbrook-funded war collection was deposited with the National Gallery.\n\nWalker also served on both the Canadian and British Commissions on War Records and Trophies, formed in 1918. In the Canadian plan, a gallery for the war pictures and a hall of trophies was to be built on Sussex Drive in Ottawa. Efforts to complete the building in 1922 and 1923 were unsuccessful and the paintings and trophies were loaned out. In 1971, the paintings were transferred from the National Gallery to the Canadian War Museum and now are displayed.\n\nFor weekend retreats, Walker began to purchase land in 1890 at De Grassi Point in Innisfil Township, Simcoe County. \"Innisfree,\" as his wife named it, became the centre of Walker's family life. There, he built \"Broadeaves\" designed by leading Canadian architect Frank Darling. Darling was the architect of the University of Toronto and designed many buildings associated with Walker such as Convocation Hall and Trinity College at the University of Toronto and the Canadian Bank of Commerce (now Commerce Court North) on King Street West in Toronto. In 1913-14, Walker built \"Innisfree Farm\" to further his interest in livestock husbandry. Innisfree was left in trust to his descendants as a private land trust. Managed today with the assistance of the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Innisfree is designated an Area of Natural and Scientific Interest for its prairie grassland and remnants of an old growth forest ecosystem.\n\nSir Byron Edmund Walker left his imprint on the financial, artistic, and intellectual development of Canada. A wizard of finance, skilled in the intricacies of exchange and international business, he molded a tiny bank into a national institution and was largely responsible for overhauling the Canadian banking system. Simultaneously he established a wide range of cultural icons - the National Gallery of Canada, the collection of \"war pictures\" forming the nucleus of the Canadian War Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Champlain Society, the federation of colleges that became the University of Toronto - and many more. An amateur paleontologist, he was also an author of note. He was knighted by King George V, was a Knight of Grace of the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, and Japan appointed him Honorary Japanese Consul-General. Walker died at the age of 75, on 27 March 1924. After his death, \"The Globe and Mail\" wrote this description of Walker:\n\"Possibly no more versatile Canadian existed in his day and age; probably few others have done so much for Canada.\"\n\nAn Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate Sir Byron Edmund Walker, C.V.O., LL.D., D.C.L. 1848-1924's role in Ontario's heritage.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5012545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5012545", "title": "Casca (series)", "text": "Casca (series)\n\nCasca is a series of paperback novels, and since January 2014, ebooks as well, created and written by author Barry Sadler in 1979. The stories revolve around the life of Casca Rufio Longinus, the soldier in the Roman legions who drove the Holy Lance into the side of Jesus Christ on Golgotha, and (in the novels) who is doomed by Jesus to wander the Earth aimlessly, always as a soldier, until the Second Coming. The character is loosely based on the Longinus legend of Christianity.\n\nSadler wrote some of the early novels in the series while the others were assigned to ghostwriters. Two subsequent novels (\"Casca 23: The Liberator\" and \"Casca 24: The Defiant\") were written by Paul Dengelegi. The current author, Tony Roberts, has written all the novels since 2006, excluding \"Casca 29: Immortal Dragon\" and \"Casca 33: The Outlaw\", which were written by Michael B. Goodwin. In April 2013, \"Casca 29: Immortal Dragon\" was removed from the list of books on casca.net due to alleged plagiarism, and shortly afterwards his other novel in the series, \"Casca 33: The Outlaw\", was removed for the same reason. There is another story, in the form of an unauthorized audiobook, \"Casca: The Outcast\", which was written by Paul Dengelegi in 2004.\n\nCasca was first introduced in \"Casca 1: The Eternal Mercenary\". Little is known about his early life, although vague clues are given in various books in the series. He spent most of his adult life serving the Roman empire in the Legions, and there are some scraps of information about his family. He grew up in the hill country of Etruria, now known as Tuscany, to the north of Rome. The village name was Falerno. When he was a child, he saw the 10th Legion march through his village en route to Gaul. His uncle, Tontine, enlisted into the army under Julius Caesar. His family died of plague and the young Casca burned the family home afterward. He enlisted into the 7th Legion at either Messilia or Livorno. His first battle under the eagle of the 7th was on the German border against the Suevii when 15,000 tribesmen attacked them at dawn. Only 300 made it back into the forests of Germania. He joined the 10th Legion and was sent to Jerusalem where he was assigned to the execution detail for three prisoners, amongst whom was Jesus.\n\nAt Golgotha, Casca stabbed Jesus with his spear, in an attempt to relieve Jesus of his pain and suffering. Jesus condemned Casca by saying, \"Soldier, you are content with what you are. Then that you shall remain until we meet again. As I go now to My Father, you must one day come to Me.\" As Jesus died, blood from his wound trickled down Casca's spear and onto his hand, and Casca unknowingly tasted it after wiping sweat from his mouth, causing his body to convulse in pain. Casca did not initially understand what was happening to him until he was condemned to work in labor mines over a 30-year period. There he slowly discovered that he does not age and cannot be killed or seriously wounded. He learned that he is immortal, although he can feel all pain inflicted on his person. While his wounds heal completely, his body accumulates countless scars over the centuries.\n\nCasca possesses an affinity for spoken languages. He can master most languages that he encounters, including their dialects, colloquialisms, and sub-tongues. Casca is also superbly skilled in edged weapons. He was first trained as a Roman Legionnaire with the Gladius Iberius sword. He later improved those skills as a Gladiator in the Circus Maximus.\n\nCasca is easily recognizable by the long facial scar that he possesses. It runs from the side of his eye to his mouth in a crescent shape, giving him a permanent sneer. Casca acquired the scar while trying to short-change a local prostitute in the Holy Land. Over the years many onlookers assume that Casca received the wound while in battle; Casca just chuckles and thinks, \"If they only knew.\"\n\nCasca knew some of the most famous people throughout history, including:\n\nHe was a surgeon in United States Army with the rank of Major, stationed at the 8th Field Hospital in Nha Trang during the Vietnam War. He first met Casca when the latter was brought into the hospital with multiple gunshot wounds and a large mortar shell fragment lodged in his skull and into his brain, which should have been fatal. Dr. Goldman discovered Casca's unusual healing properties and became his biographer and chronicler after hearing his story. He is often visited by Casca for updates on his life and experiences throughout the ages. Dr. Goldman later leaves the Army and establishes his own practice.\n\nAs Dr Goldman ages and reaches his mid-70s, he introduces Casca to Danny Landries, the son of his former army comrade, Colonel Bob Landries. Danny first meets Casca in book 34 (\"Devil's Horseman\") and gradually takes over from Goldman as his biographer.\n\nThe Brotherhood of the Lamb is a fanatical religious sect and sworn enemy of Casca. It is run by an elder, who oversees the sect's hierarchy, the Inner Circle. The circle is composed of an elder and twelve other specially chosen brothers who run the militant religious organization. They preach force and power over traditional virtues of piety and compassion.\n\nThe Brotherhood was founded by Izram, a man who called himself the Thirteenth Disciple, in the wake of Jesus's death at the hands of Casca's spear thrust. He purchased the spear from some of Casca's comrades to be used as a relic and symbol for the events on Golgotha. Known as \"The Spear of Longinus\", the sect worships the spear which forms the central focus at prayer times.\n\nOn the most holy of days in the Brotherhood's calendar, the sect recreates the crucifixion, right down to killing one of their blessed brethren who has been selected to act the part of Jesus. Another, usually the Elder, plays the part of Casca, dressed in Roman uniform, who executes \"Jesus\" with their holiest relic, the Spear of Longinus.\n\nIzram went into the wilderness for forty days before a revelation came to him: Jesus said to Casca, \"Soldier, you are content with what you are, so shall you be until we meet again\". Therefore, he reasoned that when Jesus returned at the Second Coming he would meet Casca. The Brotherhood keeps Casca in their sights until that day; though they may hate Casca for his actions on Golgotha, they must not prevent him from meeting their Lord. Casca Longinus is their path back to Christ and they will stop at nothing in keeping their most hated enemy in their sights for all time. On occasions they inflict severe pain on Casca as punishment for his actions. Once, the Elder Dacort severed Casca's hand for daring to touch the Spear at their monastery in Asia. In \"Casca 6: The Persian\", Rasheed, a minor acolyte, arranges to have Casca burned at the stake, thinking it just punishment for spearing Jesus. In \"Casca 9: The Sentinel\", Elder Gregory murders Casca's adopted son, Demos, and his woman, Ireina, for which Casca crucifies Gregory to death. Casca was also a prisoner of the Brotherhood, in \"Casca 18: The Cursed\" and \"Casca 4: Panzer Soldier\". In \"Casca 28: The Avenger\" he kills Elder Thassus as part of his mission of vengeance.\n\nIn the novel \"Casca 35: Sword of the Brotherhood\", the spear of Longinus is stolen by the Sassanid Persians and Casca is blackmailed into retrieving it.\n\nKnown Elders of The Brotherhood of the Lamb:\n\nIn Casca 28 we are introduced to the Longini, a family that is created to protect Casca through his long life. Unbeknown to the Eternal Mercenary, this family slowly grows and seeks to thwart the efforts of the Brotherhood. We encounter them next in Casca 40 where Isabella Longini helps Casca during WWII, and again in Casca 42. Unlike the common habit where when a woman marries a man and loses her maiden name, in all cases of marriage the union results in the family name of Longini being retained, thus preserving their identity to one another.\n\n\nNOTE: Books #29, \"Casca: Immortal Dragon\", and #33, \"Casca: the Outlaw\", have both been proven to be plagiarized from other books and are a) no longer considered \"canon\", b) These books have been pulled out of the order and will no longer be published, and c) These book numbers will not be re-issued, they will simply be skipped over and ignored.\n\n\nIn 2004, former \"Casca\" author Paul Dengelegi wrote an unauthorized story titled \"Casca: The Outcast\". Without the permission of the \"Casca\" publishers, he contracted with Americana Audio to have it published as a three-disc audiobook CD. This was subsequently withdrawn in 2006 following the collapse of Americana Audio.\n\nFrom January 2014, the series was put into ebook format, and all existing books in the series with the exception of the two Paul Dengelegi novels (23 & 24) and the two removed novels of Michael Goodwin (29 & 33) were available in kindle format from all amazon sites with effect from 3 June 2014.\n\n"}

{"id": "1230181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1230181", "title": "De vulgari eloquentia", "text": "De vulgari eloquentia\n\nDe vulgari eloquentia (, ; ; \"On eloquence in the vernacular\") is the title of a Latin essay by Dante Alighieri. Although meant to consist of four books, its writing was abandoned in the middle of the second book. It was probably composed shortly after Dante went into exile; internal evidence points to a date between 1302 and 1305.\n\nIn the first book, Dante discusses the relationship between Latin and vernacular, and the search for an \"illustrious\" vernacular in the Italian area; the second book is an analysis of the structure of the \"canto\" or song (also spelled \"canzuni\" in Sicilian), which is a literary genre developed in the Sicilian School of poetry.\n\nLatin essays were very popular in the Middle Ages, but Dante made some innovations in his work: firstly, the subject (writing in vernacular) was an uncommon topic in literary discussion at that time. Also significant was how Dante approached this theme; that is, he presented an argument for giving vernacular the same dignity and legitimacy Latin was typically given. Finally, Dante wrote this essay in order to analyse the origin and the philosophy of the vernacular, because, in his opinion, this language was not something static, but something that evolves and needed a historical contextualisation.\n\nDante interrupted his work at the fourteenth chapter of the second book, and though historians have tried to find a reason for this, it is still not known why Dante so abruptly aborted his essay. Indeed it is an unfinished project, and so information about its intended structure is limited. Though at some point, Dante mentions a fourth book in which he planned to deal with the comic genre and the \"mediocre\" style, nothing at all is known about the third book. It is thought, however, that the first book was meant to be a sort of preface to the following three books, and so shorter than the others.\n\nIn the beginning, Dante tackles the historical evolution of language, which he thinks was born unitary and, at a later stage, was separated into different idioms because of the presumptuousness demonstrated by humankind at the time of the building of the Tower of Babel. He compiles a map of the geographical position of the languages he knows, dividing the European territory into three parts: one to the east, with the Greek languages; one to the north, with the Germanic languages, which he believed included Magyar and Slavic languages; one to the south, separated into three Romance languages identified by their word for 'yes': oc language, oïl language and sì language. He then discusses \"gramatica\", \"grammar\", which is a static language consisting of unchanging rules, needed to make up for the natural languages. In chapters ten to fifteen of the first book, Dante writes about his search for the illustrious vernacular, among the fourteen varieties he claims to have found in the Italian region. In the second book, Dante deals with literary genres, specifying which are the ones that suit the vernacular.\n\nDante takes inspiration from rhetorical essays in Latin, Occitan, Sicilian, and Italian, and from philosophical readings. The main classical rhetorical texts from which he drew information were the \"Ars Poetica\" by Horace, the \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\" by an anonymous author, and \"De Inventione\" by Cicero. About the philosophical works, it is important to know that Dante read not only first hand texts, but also summaries that sometimes were not of the original work, but of an intermediary one. The influence and importance of the contribution of the Sicilian language is emphasized by his assertion that \"the first hundred and fifty years of Italian poetry was written in Sicilian\". \n\nThe major Occitan work that influenced Dante was probably \"Razos de trobar\" by the Catalan troubadour Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun and the \"Vers e regles de trobar\", an amplification of Vidal's manual, by Jofre de Foixà. Both of these works were Occitan manuals of grammar for troubadour poetry. They implicitly and explicitly defended Occitan as the best vernacular for song and verse, prompting Dante to come to the defence of his beloved Tuscan tongue. The popularity of both singing and composing in Occitan by Italians prompted Dante to write: , meaning \"To the perpetual shame and lowness of the wicked men of Italy, that praise somebody else's vernacular and despise their own, I say...\" (\"Convivio\", treatise I, XI).\n\nDirectly or indirectly, Dante came to read Saint Augustine's works, the \"De Consolatione Philosophiae\" by Boëthius, Saint Thomas Aquinas's works and some encyclopedic dictionaries like the \"Etymologiae\" by Isidore of Seville and the \"Livre du Tresor\" by Brunetto Latini. He takes also inspiration from Aristotelian philosophy, and references to texts by representatives of what is sometimes referred to as Radical Aristotelianism can be found in Dante's work.\n\n\n"}

W. F. Hegel. Tom Rockmore described Hegel, for example, as a polymath and \"a modern Aristotle, perhaps the last person to know everything of value that was known during his lifetime.\" Such persons are generally described as such based on their deep cognitive grasp of multiple and diverse fields of inquiry—an intellectually exceptional subset of philosophers who might also be differentiated from the multi-talented, the genius, or the \"Renaissance man.\"\n\nIt is no longer considered realistic, or feasible, for any one person to be truthfully described as having encyclopedic knowledge. The concept has been subsumed into the discourses on the production of knowledge and artificial intelligence. Instead, we are now preoccupied with knowledge bases distributed as software or web services.\n\nThe idea of encyclopedic knowledge has made many appearances in popular culture and literature. In 1887, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle introduced his fictional master sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, who applied his keen deductive acumen and prodigious range of knowledge to solve his cases. \"Encyclopedia Brown\" is a series of books by Donald J. Sobol featuring the adventures of boy detective Leroy Brown, nicknamed \"Encyclopedia\" for his intelligence and range of knowledge that was first published in 1963. One of the most celebrated is the fictional \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" by the late Douglas Adams which began its evolution through numerous mediums as a British radio program in 1978. In 2004, NPR contributor A.J. Jacobs published \"The Know-It-All\", about his experience reading the entire \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" from start to finish.\n\nWhile deep encyclopedic knowledge across numerous fields of inquiry by a single person is no longer feasible, encyclopedic knowledge within a field of inquiry or topic has great historical precedent and is still often ascribed to individuals. For example, it has been said of Raphael Lemkin that \"his knowledge of the logic behind the Nazi war machine was encyclopedic.\"\n\nIn 1900, Alexander Graham Bell, who set out to read the entire \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" himself, served as the second president of the National Geographic Society and declared the Society should cover \"the world and all that is in it.\" While this goal sounds all-encompassing, it is in fact a statement towards comprehensive geographic knowledge, meaning the scope of the National Geographic Society's enterprise should attempt to be terrestrially unbounded.\n\nIn an era of specialization, be it academic or functional or epistemological, obtaining \"domain-specific\" encyclopedic knowledge as an expert is typically celebrated and often rewarded by institutions in modern society. (This appreciation for having extensive niche knowledge, however, should not be confused with the historical experimentation and debate surrounding the \"division of labor\" which has been argued to limit the knowledge of workers compelled to perform repetitive tasks for the sake of an overall increase in economic productivity.)\n\n Edward Said, in his seminal postcolonial work, \"Orientalism\", examines the encyclopedic endeavor in great detail, revealing it to be an historically . Orientalists' \"unremitting ambition was to master \"all\" of a world, not some easily delimited part of it such as an author or a collection of texts.\"\n\nTim Chambers, an early Wikipedian who proposed the name \"Wikipedia\", has a page of historical interest in the Wikimedia archives entitled \"The Value of Encyclopedic Knowledge\" in which he describes a new model for growing encyclopedic knowledge \"powered by \"numerous\" scholars around the world.\" The idea of encyclopedic knowledge being re-constellated as a community of knowledge is central to the theory of Connectivism as established by George Siemens and Stephen Downes.\n\n"}
{"id": "696324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=696324", "title": "Evocation", "text": "Evocation\n\nEvocation is the act of calling upon or summoning a spirit, demon, god or other supernatural agent, in the Western mystery tradition. Comparable practices exist in many religions and magical traditions and may employ the use of mind-altering substances with and without uttered word formulas.\n\nThe Latin word \"evocatio\" was the \"calling forth\" or \"summoning away\" of a city's tutelary deity. The ritual was conducted in a military setting either as a threat during a siege or as a result of surrender, and aimed at diverting the god's favor from the opposing city to the Roman side, customarily with a promise of a better-endowed cult or a more lavish temple. \"Evocatio\" was thus a kind of ritual dodge to mitigate looting of sacred objects or images from shrines that would otherwise be sacrilegious or impious.\n\nThe calling forth of spirits was a relatively common practice in Neoplatonism, theurgy and other esoteric systems of antiquity. In contemporary western esotericism, the magic of the grimoires is frequently seen as the classical example of this idea. Manuals such as the \"Greater Key of Solomon the King\", The \"Lesser Key of Solomon\" (or \"Lemegeton\"), the \"Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage\" and many others provided instructions that combined intense devotion to the divine with the summoning of a personal cadre of spiritual advisers and familiars.\n\nThe grimoires provided a variety of methods of evocation. The spirits are, in many cases, commanded in the name of God - most commonly using cabalistic and Hellenic 'barbarous names' added together to form long litanies. The magician used wands, staves, incense and fire, daggers and complex diagrams drawn on parchment or upon the ground. In Enochian magic, spirits are evoked into a crystal ball or mirror, in which a human volunteer (a 'seer') is expected to be able to see the spirit and hear its voice, passing the words on to the evoker. Sometimes such a seer might be an actual medium, speaking as the spirit, not just for it. In other cases the spirit might be 'housed' in a symbolic image, or conjured into a diagram from which it cannot escape without the magician's permission.\n\nWhile many later, corrupt and commercialized grimoires include elements of 'diabolism' and one (\"The Grand Grimoire\") even offers a method for making a pact with the devil, in general the art of evocation of spirits is said to be done entirely under the power of the divine. The magician is thought to gain authority among the spirits only by purity, worship and personal devotion and study.\n\nIn more recent usage, \"evocation\" refers to the calling out of lesser spirits (beneath the deific or archangelic level), sometimes conceived of as arising from the self. This sort of evocation is contrasted with invocation, in which spiritual powers are called into the self from a divine source.\n\nImportant contributors to the concept of evocation include Henry Cornelius Agrippa, Francis Barrett, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, Aleister Crowley, Franz Bardon and Kenneth Grant. The work of all of these authors can be seen as attempts to systematize and modernize the grimoiric procedure of evocation. Many modern authors, such as Peter Carroll and Konstantinos, have attempted to describe evocation in a way independent enough from the grimoiric tradition to fit similar methods of interaction with alleged supernatural agents in other traditions.\n\nConjuration in traditional and most contemporary usage refers to a magical act of invoking spirits or using incantations or charms to cast magical spells. In the context of legerdemain, it may also refer to the performance of illusion or magic tricks for show. This article discusses mainly the original and primary usage, describing acts of a supernatural or paranormal nature.\n\nThe word conjuration (from Latin \"conjure\", \"conjurare\", to \"swear together\") can be interpreted in several different ways: as an invocation or evocation (the latter in the sense of binding by a vow); as an exorcism; and as an act of producing effects by magical means.\n\nThe word is often used synonymously with terms such as \"invocation\" or \"evocation\" or \"summoning\", although many authors find it useful to maintain some distinction between these terms. The term \"conjuring\" is also used as a general term for casting spells in some magical traditions, such as Hoodoo. In that context, amulets and talismans are often kept in a \"conjure bag\" and \"conjuring oils\" may be used to anoint candles and other magical supplies and thus imbue them with specific magical powers.\n\nAlternatively, the term \"conjuration\" may be used refer to an act of illusionism or legerdemain, as in the performance of magic tricks for entertainment.\n\nOne who performs conjurations is called a conjurer or conjuror.\nThe word (as \"conjuration\" or \"conjurison\") was formerly used in its Latin meaning of \"conspiracy\".\n\nThe text of the charms to be recited to conjure the spirit varies considerably from simple sentences to complex paragraphs with plenty of magic words. The language usually is that of the conjurer's, but since the Middle Ages in Western tradition, Latin was the most common (although many texts have been translated into other languages).\n\nThe conjuration of the ghosts or souls of the dead for the purpose of divination is called necromancy.\n\nWhen it is said that a person is calling upon or conjuring misfortune or disease, it is due to the ancient belief that personified diseases and misfortune as evil deities, spirits or demons that could enter a human or bestial body; see demon possession.\n\nA conjuration is traditionally linked to repelling negative spirits away, and protecting an individual, space or collective. However, it is also believed by some, particularly in Christianity and Islam, that magic and conjuration is an inherently evil practice. Conjurers summon demons or other evil spirits to cause harm to people or things, to obtain favors from them, or simply to enter their servitude. The belief in similarly-minded conjurers also exists in belief systems in which magic is not inherently evil, although in these cultures these \"black magicians\" are not the rule and have opposition among more traditional magicians.\n\nConjuration is a very common mystical practice in Mid-West Asia, most commonly found in Morocco, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. Many practice it to settle personal grudges or for healing, personal enhancement, or foretelling the future. There are also those who will sell their services as conjurers to others.\n\nIslam strongly forbids the use of conjuration, because it is seen as an unholy procedure, and therefore to perform it is to give an insult to Allah. It is also considered to, in the end, harm people more than help them: those who regularly contact demons are believed to go mad through overdosing on power, or being possessed (since demons are thought to be short-tempered entities, and given the opportunity might overpower and enslave the one who summoned them).\n\nWithin some magical traditions today, such as contemporary witchcraft, hoodoo and Hermeticism or ceremonial magic, conjuration may refer specifically to an act of calling or invoking deities and other spirits; or it may refer more generally to the casting of magic spells by a variety of techniques. Used in the sense of invoking or evoking deities and other spirits, conjuration can be regarded as one aspect of religious magic.\n\nIn the context of illusionist magic practiced today as entertainment only, \"conjurer\" or \"conjuror\" is still a common term used by practitioners. In times past, illusionist conjurors were suspected of using magic power to create their entertaining illusions and even suspected of casting spells. They were regarded as \"magicians\" by the general public, who were often not cognizant of the techniques and tricks used to create their illusions.\n\nEvocation is the magical art of calling forth spirits, angels or demons to bring spiritual inspiration, do the bidding of the magician or provide information. Methods of this exist in many cultures that feature a belief in spirits, such as the shamanic traditions. Daoism, Shintoism, Spiritism and the African-American religions (Santería, Umbanda etc.), have particular systems of evocation.\n\n\n\n"}

It was owned for more than a century by the Dicx family, and it remained a brewery until the beginning of the 20th century. The historic contents of the old parlor were sold to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, where they are on show.\n\nIn 1565 Dirck Diricksz. (ca. 1537-1618), a ship's captain, bought a house with property on the Scheepmakersdijk. At that time ships were built there (\"Shipbuilder's dike\"), but today this street is called the Houtmarkt. His son Dirck Diricksz. de Jonge (1571 1619) was also a captain, who married Cornelia Cornelisdr. Jonck (ca. 1570-1630) and had 4 children. In 1606 he bought a house next to his father's property, along with some other properties on the Scheepmakersdijk. He named his house \"Scheepje\", which means \"little ship\". Shortly after this he became a member of the brewer's guild, and in documents he is listed as owner of the brewery \"Het Scheepje\", which was part of the brewery \"De Vogel Struijs\", along with Johan Claesz Loo. Dirck Diricksz kept on purchasing properties until most of the brewery was his. In the facade of his former house a gable stone is a memorial to the old name with a picture of a sailing ship and the text \"Godt bewaert het schip\" (\"God saves the ship\"). In 1616 Dirck Diricksz received permission to build a windmill for grinding malt for beer. In 1618 he was promoted to mayor of Haarlem by Prince Maurits. His success did not last long however, and he died a year later, but his wife continued the beer business until her death in 1630. In June 1633 their daughter Agatha and her husband Nicolaes Olycan bought the inheritance rights of the remaining 3 children and took over the brewery and adjoining house.\n\nNicolaes Olycan, son of the brewer Pieter Jacobsz Olycan, was a member of the Haarlem brewing elite and until his death in 1639, he and his wife ran the brewery with great success. In 1631 the Amsterdam-Haarlem trekvaart was dug, which made it easier to export beer to Amsterdam by boat. Because the rear of the brewery was on the canal leading to the trekvaart, the brewery was located very advantageously for this business. The couple gave employment to many \"zakkedragers\" (\"carriers\") for loading and unloading boats at the front and rear of the property. Another gable stone attests to this with the symbol of the carrier's guild, a man with a sack on his back. There was also a disadvantage to this location however. In the night of 14–15 November 1775, a flood caused the water to rise and the entire area of the Scheepmakersdijk came under water, and the windows of Het Scheepje were so low to the ground that the water came in through the windows.\n\nLike her mother before her, Agatha continued the business after the death of her husband and when she died in 1667 it was taken over by her two daughters Marie and Alida. They called themselves Dicx, and it was descendants of this family, Catharina and Cornelia Dicx, who sold the brewery at auction in 1818.\n\nHet Scheepje remained a brewery until 1916 when it was sold to the Stuyt brothers, who were cheese traders. They rebuilt the premises for cheese storage in 1918 and had the 17th century parlor room dismantled for sale to H. H. Lugard Jr., who wanted to use it for a museum in Deventer. Before dismantling it, Karel Sluyterman had his engineering students make detailed sketches and photographs of the room. In 1926 many of the rooms in Het Scheepje were again redesigned when the premises became a printing shop. Little remains today of the original layout of the 17th century house.\n\nThe Deventer museum plans never materialized and the room contents were put up for sale again in 1923, when the Historical Society of Haarlem tried to purchase it for the Frans Hals Museum. It was bought by J.D. De Vries of New York, who in turn sold it to Edward Bok to be installed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Sluyterman was consulted and his drawings were used for the final installation in the museum.\n\n"}

IFML includes a set of graphic notations to create visual models of user interactions and front-end behavior in software systems.\n\nThe Interaction Flow Modeling Language was developed in 2012 and 2013 under the lead of WebRatio and was inspired by the WebML notation, as well as by a few other experiences in the Web modeling field.\n\nIt was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG) in March 2013.\n\nIFML supports the platform independent description of graphical user interfaces for applications accessed or deployed on such systems as desktop computers, laptop computers, PDAs, mobile phones, and tablets. The focus of the description is on the structure and behavior of the application as perceived by the end user.\n\nIFML describes user interactions and control behaviors of front-end of applications belonging to the following domains:\nIFML does not cater to the specification of bi-dimensional and tri-dimensional computer based graphics.\n\nIFML does not apply to the modeling of presentation issues (layout/look and feel) of an application front-end or to the design of business logic and data components. Although these aspects are not the focus of the language, IFML allows designers to reference external models or modeling artifacts regarding these aspects from within IFML models.\n\nThe IFML specification consists of:\n\nAn IFML model consists of one or more \"view container\"s (possibly nested).\nFor example, windows in traditional desktop applications or page templates in\nWeb applications. A view container can contain \"view component\"s, which denote\nthe publication of static or dynamic content, or interface elements for data entry\n(such as input forms). A view component can have input and output \"parameter\"s.\n\nA view container and a view component can be associated with \"event\"s, that can represent users'\ninteractions or system-generated occurrences. For example, an event for selecting\none or more items from a list or for submitting inputs from a form. The effect\nof an event is represented by an \"interaction flow\" connection. The interaction\nflow expresses a change of state of the user interface. An event\ncan also trigger an \"action\", which is executed prior to updating\nthe state of the user interface; for example, a delete or update operation on\ninstances of a database. An input-output dependency between elements can be specified through\nparameter bindings associated with navigation flows or through \"data flow\"s, that only describe data transfer.\n\nIFML also includes concepts for defining constraints, modularization, and context awareness (e.g., based on user profile, device, location) over modeling elements.\nIFML concepts can be extended with standard extension mechanisms based on stereotyping.\n\nThe cost of front-end application development has increased with the emergence of an unprecedented range of devices, technological platforms, and communication channels, which are not accompanied by the advent of an adequate approach for creating a Platform Independent Model (PIM) that can be used for designing user interactions independently of the implementation platform. This causes front-end development to be a costly and inefficient process, where manual coding is the predominant development approach, reuse of design artifacts is low, and portability of applications across platforms remains difficult.\n\nIFML brings several benefits to the development of application front-ends:\n\nIFML is currently supported by WebRatio .\nA set of blog posts describing the standardization process is available here.\n\nA new, opensource IFML editor based on Eclipse, EMF/GMF and the Graphiti API is under development. The\ntool will be released as an open-source Eclipse Project. The tool will include mappings from IFML abstract concepts to the platform-\nspecific concepts of Java Swing, Microsoft WPF, and HTML.\nThe modeling of the IFML diagrams for the UI part can be complemented with (executable) UML diagrams according to fUML specifications combined with Alf\nscripts for the back-end business logic. A sneak preview of the tool features can be seen in this video.\n\nIFML was inspired by the WebML notation, invented at Politecnico di Milano by Stefano Ceri and Piero Fraternali, with a team of people including Roberto Acerbis, Aldo Bongio, Marco Brambilla, Sara Comai, Stefano Butti and Maristella Matera.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3051678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3051678", "title": "Refrigerator magnet", "text": "Refrigerator magnet\n\nA refrigerator magnet or fridge magnet is an ornament, often whimsical, attached to a small magnet, which is used to post items such as shopping lists, child art or reminders on a refrigerator door, or which simply serves as decoration. Refrigerator magnets come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and may have promotional messages placed on them. Refrigerator magnets are popular souvenir and collectible objects.\n\nThe first fridge magnets were cylindrical or solid rectangular magnets. Later, a flexible magnet was developed, composed of a high-coercivity ferromagnetic compound (usually ferric oxide) mixed with a plastic binder. This is extruded as a sheet and passes on a conveyor belt over a line of powerful cylindrical permanent magnets. These magnets are arranged in a stack with alternating magnetic poles facing up (N, S, N, S...) on a freely rotating shaft. This impresses the plastic sheet with the magnetic poles in an alternating line format. No electromagnetism is used to generate the magnets. The pole-pole distance is on the order of 5 mm, but varies with manufacturer. Ferrite magnets are commonly used, too, with decorative elements attached to the magnets with adhesive. They were created in the 1920s.\n\nUnlike most conventional magnets that have distinct north and south poles, flat refrigerator magnets are magnetized during manufacture with alternating north and south poles on the refrigerator side. This can be felt by taking two similar (or identical) refrigerator magnets and sliding them against each other with the \"magnetic\" sides facing each other: the magnets will alternately repel and attract as they are moved a few millimeters. One can note that magnetic field outside a uniformly magnetized thin sheet is actually zero, neglecting the edge effects (see, for instance, D. Budker and A. Sushkov, \"Physics in Your Feet\", OUP, 2015\"), so a uniformly magnetized magnet does not stick to a refrigerator. Most magnets have a special, slightly more sophisticated magnetization pattern called a Halbach array. This construction gives enhanced magnetic field on one side and almost zero magnetic field on the other.\n\nCollecting magnets is a hobby, with some collectors specializing in magnets from their travels, or of a particular theme. They are sold at souvenir shops worldwide. There is no generally recognized term (e.g. numismatics for currency collecting) for magnet collecting. A Russian collector has proposed the term memomagnetics (Russian: \"мемомагнетика\"), derived from the words \"memoriale\" (Latin) and \"magnetis\" (Greek) A collector of magnets would be called memomagnetist. These terms have been used by at least one Russian online community for magnet collectors.\n\nAccording to Collector's Lot magazine, in March 1999, Tony Lloyd of Cardiff, Wales, coined the term \"thuramgist\" for a \"collector of fridge magnets\".\n\nAt one time, the largest verified collection of refrigerator magnets belonged to Louise J. Greenfarb from Henderson, Nevada (suburb of Las Vegas, United States). Her world record was included to the \"Guinness World Records\" with 19,300 items as of 1997. According to the British \"Book of alternative records\", it grew to 29,000 as of February 2002, and later up to over 30,000 items. Over 7,000 magnets from Greenfarb's collection were exhibited at the Guinness Museum in Las Vegas, which has since closed. According to her son, Bryan Greenfarb, as of November 2015 Louise still collects and has around 45,000 plus non-duplicate refrigerator magnets but the Guinness verification process, which can take over 6 plus months, is just too taxing to keep validating the exact number.\n\nIn January 1999, Tony Lloyd, a teacher in Cardiff, Wales, was interviewed by the Channel 4 Television programme \"Collector's Lot\" when it was ascertained that he had largest collection of fridge magnets in Europe at that time, over 2000. As of January 2016 he had a collection of over 4500. He was again interviewed by the BBC and ITV during 2017. In February 2018, whilst on holiday in Sri Lanka, his 104th country, Tony's collection surpassed 5,000 magnets.\n\nRefrigerator magnets are also popular as crafts projects.\n"}

Generally speaking, they are members of the family Soleidae, but, outside Europe, the name \"sole\" is also applied to various other similar flatfish, especially other members of the sole suborder Soleoidei as well as members of the flounder family. In European cookery, there are several species which may be considered \"true soles\", but the common or Dover sole \"Solea solea\", often simply called \"the sole\", is the most esteemed and most widely available.\n\nThe word \"sole\" in English, سول پیس in Urdu, French and Italian comes from its resemblance to a sandal, Latin \"solea\". In other languages, it is named for the tongue, e.g. , , or ', , , Elsan Eth-thawr (for the common sole) '.\n\nA partial list of common names for species referred to as sole include:\n\n\nThe true sole, \"Solea solea\", is sufficiently distributed that it is not considered a threatened species; however, overfishing in Europe has produced severely diminished populations, with declining catches in many regions. For example, the western English Channel and Irish Sea sole fisheries face potential collapse according to data in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.\n\nSole, along with the other major bottom-feeding fish in the North Sea such as cod, monkfish, and plaice, is listed by the ICES as \"outside safe biological limits.\" Moreover, they are growing less quickly now and are rarely older than six years, although they can reach forty. World stocks of large predatory fish and large ground fish such as sole and flounder were estimated in 2003 to be only about 10% of pre-industrial levels. According to the World Wildlife Fund in 2006, \"of the nine sole stocks, seven are overfished with the status of the remaining two unknown.\"\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International has added the common sole to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "181274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181274", "title": "The Young Ones (TV series)", "text": "The Young Ones (TV series)\n\nThe Young Ones is a British sitcom, broadcast in the United Kingdom from 1982 to 1984 in two six-part series. Shown on BBC2, it featured anarchic, offbeat humour which helped bring alternative comedy to British television in the 1980s and made household names of its writers and performers. In 1985, it was shown on MTV, one of the first non-music television shows on the fledgling channel. In a 2004 poll, it ranked at number 31 in the BBC's list of \"Britain's Best Sitcoms\". The show's title relates to the song of the same name, written by Sid Tepper and Roy C. Bennett, and sung by Cliff Richard and The Shadows, which was a No. 1 UK hit single.\n\n\"The Young Ones\" originated on London's comedy club circuit in the early 1980s, where most of the show's cast had gained popularity at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the prominent act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive compere. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as the double act 20th Century Coyote, which later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was also in a double act with Peter Richardson called \"The Outer Limits\".\n\nAs The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote, and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in the Raymond Revuebar club in Soho. The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy venues in London, and came to the attention of Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then negotiated a deal for six self-contained half-hour films, using the group as comedy actors rather than stand-up performers. In response, the BBC began negotiations with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in a sitcom in a similar style. Paul Jackson was installed as a producer. Richardson's project, \"The Comic Strip Presents...\", aired on Channel 4's opening night on 2 November 1982, with \"The Young Ones\" following a week later on BBC2.\n\nThe series was written by Mayall, his then-girlfriend Lise Mayer, and Ben Elton (who had attended the University of Manchester with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was originally set to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian. The show was voted number 31 in the BBC's Best Sitcom poll in 2004.\n\nThe main characters were four undergraduate students who were sharing a house: aggressive punk medical student, Vyvyan Basterd (Adrian Edmondson); conceited wannabe anarchist sociology student, Rick (Rik Mayall); oppressed paranoid hippie peace studies student, Neil Wheedon Watkins Pye (Nigel Planer); and the suave, charming would-be underground mob boss, Mike The-Cool-Person (Christopher Ryan). It also featured Alexei Sayle, who played various members of the Balowski family—most often Jerzei Balowski, the quartet's landlord—and occasional independent characters, such as the train driver in \"Bambi\" and the Mussolini-lookalike Police Chief in \"Cash\".\n\nThe show combined traditional sitcom style with violent slapstick, non-sequitur plot turns, and surrealism. These older styles were mixed with the working and lower-middle class attitudes of the growing 1980s alternative comedy boom, in which all the principal performers except Ryan had been involved. Every episode except one featured a live performance by a band, including Madness, Motörhead, and The Damned. This was a device used to qualify the series for a larger budget, as \"variety\" shows attracted higher fees than \"comedy\".\n\nStories were set in a squalid house where the four students lived during their time at the fictional Scumbag College. It can be classified as a comedy of manners.\n\nWhen it was first broadcast, the show gained attention for its violent slapstick, which Edmondson and Mayall had been using in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also featured surreal elements, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with lengthy cutaways with no relation to the main plot. Throughout the series, the fourth wall was frequently broken for comedic effect by all characters at various parts of the show. The wall was usually broken as either a punchline to a joke or to make a plot point more obvious. On several occasions, Alexei Sayle broke both the fourth wall and character to address the audience in his real-life Liverpudlian accent.\n\nThe show featured a wide variety of guest appearances by comedians, actors, and singers, including co-creator Ben Elton, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Hale and Pace, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Mark Arden, Stephen Frost, Jools Holland, Mel Smith, Griff Rhys Jones, Terry Jones, Chris Barrie, Norman Lovett, Lenny Henry, David Rappaport, Robbie Coltrane, Tony Robinson, Andy De La Tour, and Emma Thompson.\n\nEpisodes in the second series sometimes included \"flash frames\" (three frames, equivalent to one eighth of a second), but these were edited out of some repeats. These were included as a mockery of the public's fear of subliminal messages in television and music. Unlike original flash frames, which lasted only one frame, these were long enough to be noticeable without being identifiable. The images included the end caption of \"Carry On Cowboy\", a rusty dripping tap, a leaping frog, a dove in flight, a skier, and a hand making pottery.\nThe episodes lasted 35 minutes, but are often edited to half-hour when repeated on the BBC or satellite channels.\n\nIn the United States, \"The Young Ones\" started airing on MTV on 5 June 1985. The show also ran on PBS, USA Network's Night Flight, Comedy Central in 1994, and BBC America in the early 2000s.\n\nIn New Zealand, the show premièred late at night on 30 August 1985, after TVNZ purchased the broadcast rights.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the show was aired in 1985 by public broadcaster VPRO.\n\nIn Catalonia, public broadcaster TV3 began airing the show in February 1986 on a Sunday evening slot. The show became very popular and got several re-runs in successive years. Indeed, in 2016, Nigel Planer appeared in a show involving foreign travellers visiting Catalonia. One of the characteristics of the Catalan dubbing is that Vyvyan speaks with a thick Catalan rural accent, totally opposed to his urban environment in the series.\n\nThe series' theme song featured the cast singing Cliff Richard and The Shadows' UK No. 1 song \"The Young Ones\" (1961), the title song from the film of the same name. Throughout the series there are many references to Richard, as Mayall's character is a fan.\n\nThe theme over the end credits was written by Peter Brewis, who also created the incidental music on many episodes.\n\nIn 1984, after the second series, Planer (in character as Neil) reached No. 2 in the UK charts with a version of Traffic's \"Hole in My Shoe\". The accompanying \"Neil's Heavy Concept Album\", a loose collection of songs and spoken comedy, included appearances by \"The Young Ones\" alumni Dawn French and Stephen Fry.\n\nIn 1986 the cast sang \"Living Doll\" with Cliff Richard and Hank Marvin for Comic Relief. The song, a reworking of his 1959 hit, reached the top of the UK, Australian, and New Zealand Charts.\n\nEleven of the twelve episodes had a musical guest performing in the house or street. By including the groups, the show qualified as variety rather than light entertainment by the BBC and was allocated a bigger budget than a sitcom. Groups that appeared included Dexys Midnight Runners, Motörhead, The Damned, and Madness, who appeared in two episodes. The one episode that featured no musical act still fulfilled the variety criteria by including a lion tamer whose presence also directly contributed to the plot.\n\nSome of these performances were omitted from DVD release for copyright reasons. Some musical acts were also edited out for similar reasons on some satellite reruns.\n\nPortrayed by Christopher Ryan\n\nMike is the assumed leader of the group (within which Vyvyan is his enforcer) who frequently makes puns, which are either deliberately cheap or humorous. These confusing, profound-sounding phrases baffle the others (for example, when asked by Rick if he stole his half an apple, Mike replies; \"Well, if you're gonna sin you might as well be original.\") Mike is supposedly the 'ladies' man' and often brags of his prowess with women, although he is shown to share his bed with an inflatable sex doll and practically admitted his virginity to the others in \"Nasty\". He makes every attempt at wooing the opposite sex, being both forward and unsuccessful. During \"Boring\", however, he has an encounter with (and also instigated by) Vyvyan's mother, where (until after a comment made by Rick), he makes progress, although her direct approach initially worries Mike.\n\nMike is a con artist: he always has some kind of plan to make quick money such as renting out Rick's bedroom as a roller disco and taking bids for the unexploded atomic bomb that fell into the house. He also fancies himself to be a rising underground mob boss. Mike attends Scumbag College only nominally as he has blackmailed his tutor and the Dean of the school for grants and successful grades. This is shown in the title sequence of series 1 in which he is seen to pay a bribe in exchange for a qualification. In \"Summer Holiday\" he muses, \"I think I'll ask for one of those PhDs next year.\" While it wasn't mentioned what he was studying at the college, when it once came up, in \"Sick\", by Mrs. Wheedon Watkins Pye when Neil was introducing him, he answers her, \"\"I'm in, what you'd call, a \"school of life\", Mrs. Pye\"\" (before groping her).\n\nWhile Mike often does things at the expense of, or to the detriment of, his housemates, he rarely expresses the sort of open hostility that Rick and Vyvyan do, and seems to cause his housemates trouble only when it benefits him, rather than out of sadistic joy. While it is rare for him to be victim to violence, he has been on a few occasions; such as when he was flirting with a Christian, this resulted in her repeatedly kneeing Mike in the crotch. At the end of the \"Living Doll\" song with Cliff Richard, Vyvyan hit Mike and everyone else over the head with a hammer, knocking them out. Also when Mike was trying to nail plates to the dining table, he managed to nail his own legs to the table in the process. On another occasion, Mike accidentally knocked Neil out during a game of cricket.\n\nMike has been shown to be helpful to the others on occasion; if any situation becomes problematic he does what he can to try and restore calm. He also tried to teach Vyvyan how to tell time in \"Bambi\" and in the final episode \"Summer Holiday\", he comforts Vyvyan when he bursts into tears after crashing his car and when SPG dies.\nHe also appears to have more sense than the others, while he frequently says odd things and does little to stop his housemates causing chaos, he can be very rational if his own life is at risk or if he feels it's gone too far. Examples of this include trying to stop Vyvyan detonating the bomb, being concerned that Neil might suffocate when sick, forcing Vyvyan to stop using the dangerously modified vacuum cleaner and being the only one to have a (not very good) plan thought out when they rob the bank.\nPerversely, when it is not of personal interest, he often pretends to misunderstand things that people say or make up nonsense for his own amusement or convenience.\n\nAlthough generally aloof and laid back, Mike loses his cool when his authority is questioned, however small. For example, in \"Summer Holiday\" when Vyvyan tells everyone to shut up he was very indignant that this included him.\nMike is the shortest member of the four, and the best-dressed and groomed of all of them. In the final episode, \"Summer Holiday\", Mike admits that he came from very poor beginnings out on the streets, and had sworn that he would never again go back to that life, thus his leap into a con artist's life in the first place.\n\nMike's surname is ambiguous, \"The Bachelor Boys\" book refers to him as \"The Cool Person\" several times, but in different styles including quotes.\n\nPortrayed by Rik Mayall\n\nRick is a self-proclaimed anarchist who is studying sociology and/or domestic sciences (depending on the episode). Rick writes bad poetry, and styles himself \"The People's Poet\", believing himself to be the \"spokesperson for a generation\"; he is in fact a hypocritical, tantrum-throwing, attention-seeking Diva and Cliff Richard fan, or, as Vyvyan describes him, \"The classic example of an only child!\" Rick constantly tries to impress the others using wit and humour, despite not having any discernible talent. The only time he comes close to succeeding is when it seems like he has wooed a girl; this turns out to be a lie, however, and he is exposed and punished (beset by Vyvyan) almost immediately. He insults Neil at every opportunity, using Neil as a target and an outlet, picks fights and bickers with Vyvyan and attempts to impress Mike. He is portrayed as being so self-absorbed that he believes he is the \"most popular member of the flat\" despite being disliked by virtually everyone he knows; even though his housemates hate him, he claims that they all \"really are terrific friends\". This is further emphasised in the episode \"Bambi\" when Neil reads graffiti aloud from Rick's History 'O' Level text book; \"Prick is a wonker- signed, The Rest of the Class\" which Rick dismisses as banter until Neil further reads \"I agree with the rest of the class – signed, Teacher.\"\n\nHe can't say the \"R\" sound correctly and instead enunciates a mixture of a \"W\" and a \"R\" sound. In the episode \"Bomb\", he dictates his name to a woman who looks up in confusion and repeats it back as \"Wick?\". Vyvyan, for his own amusement, describes Rick's name as being spelled \"with a silent P\", as he wrote it on Rick's name card (\"PRick\") during the University Challenge against Footlights College in the episode \"Bambi\".\n\nRick's political beliefs vary, depending on how they benefit his particular situation, but can usually be categorised as radical. While Rick sees himself as both a revolutionary and follower of Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, in reality he has little understanding of the political ideals he purports to follow, and aspirations that far exceeds his reach. During \"Cash\" he is shown with a copy of Marx's \"Das Kapital\", seemingly having fallen asleep while trying to read it.\n\nHe greatly dislikes Margaret Thatcher, as is noted by his threatening to blow up England with an atomic bomb in the episode \"Bomb\" if she \"doesn't do something to help the kids, by this afternoon\", and from negative references to Thatcher and the Conservative Party mentioned in \"The Young Ones\" book \"Bachelor Boys\". However, Rick sometimes displays a markedly conservative mindset, contrary to the image he has adopted, as again in \"Bomb\" while talking to an old man at the DHSS office (which he has mistaken for a post office), and in \"Summer Holiday\" comments \"That's one thing I'll say for Thatcher, she definitely has put this country back on its feet\".\n\nRick is vegetarian, agnostic, and wishes all men to love each other like brothers, except for Neil, whom he hates.\nThis hatred is ironic as in theory he and Neil share many values, such as a longing for a peaceful world and a hatred for meat and alcohol. However unlike Neil, Rick has been known to both drink (see time sbd interesting) and is occasionally physically violent, therefore his hatred of Neil merely shows his hypocrisy.\nDespite this he claims to care for the people but nearly everything he does is hypocritical and self-serving.\n\nRick exaggerates or lies about his political activism and class background, which is exposed in the final episode, \"Summer Holiday\", when it is suggested he comes from a well-off family with Conservative beliefs. He is a closet-transvestite, as during \"Nasty\" Neil finds a dress in Rick's wardrobe with his name stitched in it. In the episode \"Cash\", Rick admits to Mike that he is unable to tell the time, a trait that he shares with Vyvyan.\n\nIn an interview for the BBC series \"Comedy Connections\", Ben Elton described Rick's character as the \"try-hard wanna-be Leftie\" typically found on university campuses.\n\nPortrayed by Adrian Edmondson\n\nVyvyan, often referred to as \"Vyv\", is a psychopathic, sociopathic, sadistic, misanthropic punk medical student. He has spiked red hair and four metal stars seemingly embedded into his forehead. He wears a denim waistcoat over a black T-shirt, a black studded belt across his denim jeans and bovver boots. In the episode \"Interesting\", he drinks a pint of blue liquid which makes his hair fall out and the number 666 is visible on the side of his head. He is extremely violent and regularly attacks Neil and Rick with pieces of wood, cricket bats, other large objects or simply his fists. For some reason he looks up to Mike, whom he never attacks and often addresses as \"Michael\". He despises Rick more than he does Neil; for example when Rick, Mike and Neil meet his mother at a bar in the episode \"Boring\", he calls both Neil and Mike his friends, but refers to Rick as \"a complete bastard.\" This antagonistic relationship between Rick and Vyvyan makes them virtually inseparable, as the two spend by far more time together than with the other housemates, albeit this time is spent fighting.\n\nVyvyan owns a talking Glaswegian hamster named Special Patrol Group (\"SPG\" for short) of whom he is very fond, although SPG is also frequently subjected to Vyvyan's extreme violence. This is usually provoked, such as when SPG bit Vyvyan and made him destroy his cardboard submarine in \"Flood\" or plugging in the TV after Vyvyan swallowed it in \"Bomb\". Vyvyan's mother is a barmaid and former shoplifter, who named him a girls name \"Vyvyan\", gave him his first gift (a box of matches) at 8-weeks-old, and before the events of \"Boring\" had not seen Vyvyan in ten years and still has no idea who his father is. Neil revealed that Vyvyan has more friends than the other housemates but \"... apparently he doesn't like any of them.\"\n\nVyvyan occasionally displays feats of superhuman strength and resilience, such as surviving a pickaxe through his head, moving entire walls with his bare hands, lifting Neil above his head in a fight with Rick, biting through a brick (making the comment that some of the house's bricks explode), using dynamite to try and cure his hangover, and even being decapitated and re-attaching his own head. He eats just about anything from televisions and dead rats to caviar and cornflakes with ketchup.\n\nRegardless of his violent and mostly simple-minded nature, Vyvyan seems to be the smartest of the group (though Neil does better in exams than him), and he has on a couple of occasions demonstrated his talent as a medical student. In the episode \"Flood\", he develops a potion to transform a person into an \"axe-wielding homicidal maniac\", claiming that \"it's basically a cure... for \"not\" being an axe-wielding homicidal maniac... the potential market's enormous!\". On occasion, he has made several eloquent statements regarding subjects ranging from Rick's manifest personality problems to the inherent dullness of \"The Good Life\", and the end of \"Oil\" implies he manipulated the rest of the household, possibly for amusement. Vyvyan also appears to have good knowledge of electrics and technology; on one occasion he wired the doorbell to a bomb \"to pep it up a bit\" so the housemates would be able to hear it, and he also added a small car engine to the vacuum cleaner as previously it \"looked a bit on the tentative side\" which then proceeds to suck up the carpet, the floorboards and a friend of Neil's. The vacuum also prompted one of the few clashes between Vyvyan and Mike; when Mike admonished Vyvyan and told him not to use it any more, Vyvyan replied by calling him a \"poof\". In the episode \"Nasty\", the boys trap a vampire in their bathroom, and when he denies being a vampire, Vyvyan successfully tricks him into admitting that he is. In \"Bambi\" Vyvyan displays impressive mathematical talent as he worked out instantly that he has worn his three pairs of knickers 269 times each since their last wash. However, like Rick, he cannot tell the time from a watch.\n\nAlthough Vyvyan is constantly unruly, he does possess a compassionate side; primarily in the episode \"Cash\", when he thought he was pregnant he was considering names to call his baby and he also patted his \"bump\" saying \"that's my boy!\" when it hit Rick in the face and knocked him into the fireplace. Also when Vyvyan began having \"contractions\" he appealed to the other housemates for help, this led to Neil getting a job in the police force (it was later revealed that he just had a really bad case of built-up gas). On another occasion, in the last episode \"Summer Holiday\" Vyvyan dissolved into tears because he crashed his car and also because it caused SPG's death while he was asleep on the car's radiator.\n\nVyvyan is the only member of the group who owns a car, a yellow Ford Anglia with red flames painted along the sides and has \"Vyv\" written across the back window. Neil is forbidden from touching his car, as when he suggested using it to listen to a tape, Vyvyan cheerfully reminded him that he would be killed if he even touched the car.\nHe also appears to have exceptional knowledge of driving and road awareness, as he demonstrated when he tricked the vampire in \"Nasty\" to admitting he was really a vampire rather than a driving instructor as he had initially said. Vyvyan is not the only house member who can drive, however, during the last episode Rick is briefly seen driving the stolen AEC Routemaster double-decker bus.\n\nPortrayed by Nigel Planer.\n\nNeil Pye, is a morose, pacifist, vegetarian hippie working toward a Peace Studies degree. He is frequently victimised by the other housemates and forced to do the housework, shopping, cleaning and cooking. He is never acknowledged for it unless it goes wrong. He normally provides tea to drink and cornflakes or lentils for his housemates to eat.\n\nNeil is a pessimist and believes everyone and everything hates him, although he does have three hippie friends; one also named Neil, one named Warlock and a female hippie named Stonehenge. This makes him the second most sociable character behind Vyvyan and also the only character to have a female friend. He dislikes most forms of technology except for televisions and video recorders. He appears to be a fan of cartoon series Scooby-Doo, missing an episode his major concern when the house is transported back to the Middle Ages in 'Time'. He avoids sleep, believing that it causes cancer, and in the episode \"Boring\" he is shown to merely be standing at his window waiting for dawn. Neil frequently demonstrates a very literal interpretation of terms and phrases. For example, when Vyvyan says that his mother used to be a shoplifter, Neil responds \"She doesn't look strong enough... to lift shops\".\n\nNeil wants the others to feel sorry for him, or just acknowledge his presence. He claims \"the most interesting thing that ever happens to me is sneezing\", the force of which is sufficient to blow a door off its hinges.\n\nIn the pilot episode \"Demolition\", Neil is shown to have suicidal tendencies, attempting to kill himself at least three times. However, this was not carried through for the rest of the series, with the exception of the episode \"Boring\", in which he attempts to kill himself in a desperate attempt at relieving boredom. On only two occasions has Neil shown any form of aggression; this was when Rick insulted Neil's flared trousers in the episode 'Nasty'. He also seemed to enjoy hitting people with his truncheon when he became a police officer in \"Cash\" and did the same to his housemates when he thought they had committed a robbery.\n\nIn the episode \"Sick\" in the second series, Neil's parents are introduced as upper middle class Tories who look down on Neil for starring in such a disreputable comedy series. His father wonders why his son cannot be in a nice comedy, such as the ones Neil's mother likes e.g. \"The Good Life\". This provokes an angry tirade from Vyvyan, on his hatred of that show, followed by a parody episode of \"The Good Life\" where Neil is killed by Rick and covered with garden fertiliser only for several of him to emerge from the ground later on.\n\nAs established in \"Neil's Heavy Concept Album\", Neil comes from Twickenham (his name punning on Eel Pie Island). His middle names (\"Wheedon Watkins\") are revealed in \"Neil's Book of the Dead\".\n\nHe is a fan of Hawkwind, Marillion, and Steve Hillage. More information about his musical tastes was revealed when the character 'guest v-jayed' on the still young MTV network in ca. 1985, playing several videos (e.g. T. Rex, \"Get It On\"), including his own hit \"Hole in My Shoe\", a cover version of the Traffic song which Nigel Planer, as his character \"neil\" [with a small 'n'], took to number 2 in the UK singles chart in July 1984.\n\nThroughout the two series, Alexei Sayle routinely appeared as many different characters, interjecting his own material into the programme in ways that emulated his comedy routines. His main role was that of the flat's landlord Jerzei (Jeremy) Balowski, which was the only character he reprised, appearing in \"Demolition\", \"Flood\" and \"Summer Holiday\". The rest of the time, he was billed as playing various male members of \"The Balowski Family\", including nephew \"Alexei Yuri Gagarin Siege of Stalingrad Glorious Five Year Plan Sputnik Tractor Moscow Dynamo Back Four Balowski\" (a protest singer), son Reggie Balowski (an international arms dealer), brother Billy Balowski (a lunatic who believed he was a taxi driver), cousin Tommy Balowski (a drunk), escaped convict Brian Damage Balowski, and a medieval jester \"Jester Balowski\" (with Helen Lederer as his sidekick).\n\nJerzei was apparently Russian; however, several times during the series he would break character, or in one case the fourth wall and declare directly to the camera \"I'm not really foreign, you know – I just do it to appear more sophisticated!\" Also during a discussion between the guys about his nationality Vyv comments \"He certainly knows a lot about the Mersey Sound.\"— implying he is in fact from Liverpool, although he is so worried when Mike lies about a visit from Moscow Dynamo ice hockey squad that he allows the gang to renege on their monthly rent.\n\nIn the second series, Sayle's characters also included a train driver, a Benito Mussolini look-alike (by day the head of the local police force, by night an entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest), \"Harry the Bastard\" (manager of the local Rumbelows electrical goods store, disguised as a South African vampire) and, very briefly in an aside sketch that deliberately bore no relevance to the plot, a man in a bowler hat asking if he was in a cheese shop (a reference to the Monty Python Cheese Shop sketch).\n\nMike is the natural \"leader\" of the house. Always trying to make himself appear more important and exciting than he really is, he does appear to have done some of the things he claims to have done (such as getting Bambi the \"Babycham\" Advert in \"Bambi\"). He experiences little hostility from the other members of the house. If there is any \"fruitful\" or amicable relationship in the house it is between Mike and Vyvyan. Vyvyan accepts Mike's role as the house leader whereas Mike needs Vyvyan's physique and willingness to act forcibly to enforce his own authority (as was literally shown in \"Oil\" when Vyvyan became 'Col. Vyvyan', the right-hand-man to Mike's 'El Presidente').\n\nNeil is unpopular, although he is the only one who performs any kind of household chores and is therefore needed by the other three.\n\nRick is the most disliked although he thinks very highly of himself. He tells poor jokes and stories (but finds them hilarious himself), is a would-be anarchist (although deep-down he is quite conservative), and frequently acts like a child when he does not get his way. He generally vents his frustration (when trying to impress the others) on Neil, since Neil never sticks up for himself and is ignored by the others. The majority of his anger is generated in endless battles with Vyvyan, which he invariably loses.\n\nRik Mayall once opined that the characters in \"The Young Ones\" form the basis of a classic nuclear family, comprising Neil as the mother figure, Mike as the father figure and Vyvyan and Rick as the children, Vyvyan the boy and Rick the girl.\n\nIn the first six episodes of the series, a person whose hair covers their face appears in the background of some scenes, such as to the left when Neil gets hit by Vyvyan with a kettle in \"Bomb\". In the episode Demolition he appears slumped against the back wall when Rick is watching TV. These rumours of a mysterious fifth housemate have been the subject of fan speculation on the internet. In 2016 journalist Peter Farquhar sent members of the cast and crew email enquiries about this unnamed character. Writer Ben Elton replied saying \"I have no idea what you are talking about I'm afraid...\" but Geoff Posner, one of the directors of the series replied saying that he and Paul Jackson \"thought it would be fun to have some ghostly figure in the background of some scenes that was never explained or talked about...\" \n\nDuring an event at the Bristol Slapstick Festival 2018, Ade Edmondson was asked about the fifth housemate during an audience question session and named the person playing the 'fifth housemate' as his university friend Mark Dewison. Mark also played a speaking role as Neil's friend (also called 'Neil') during series one episode \"Interesting\". He emerges from Vyvyan's full vacuum cleaner bag and ends up being shoved into the fridge by Rick.\n\nIn an exclusive documentary \"How the Young Ones Changed Comedy\" that aired in 2018 on Gold, series co-writer Lise Mayer stated that the idea was there had been a party at the student house at some point in the past and there was a person who had just never left. This is why you see them just hanging around.\n\nIn the final episode, the four students steal a red AEC Routemaster after robbing a bank (Special Patrol Group dies during their escape), only to drive it through a billboard with a picture of Cliff Richard on it and then over a cliff, which the bus tumbles down until it comes to rest at the bottom, at which point they proclaim—in unison—\"Phew! That was close!\", after which the bus explodes. Although Vyvyan and some of the others have had (what should have been) fatal accidents before without suffering any real effects, this time it really signified the end of the series. Even so, it did not stop The Young Ones from occasionally appearing on TV afterwards for charity, such as in Comic Relief in 1986 with a video clip and live performance of \"Living Doll\".\n\nAlthough the series was set in north London, many external scenes were filmed in Bristol, namely the suburb of Bishopston, where the student house is situated at the top of Codrington Road. Other locations include the Fascist Pig Bank, the Launderette and the Army Careers Office, all around the corner on Gloucester Road. The pub in which Vyvyan's mum works, the Kebab and Calculator in the series, was the Cock of the North (since renamed the Westbury Park Tavern) in Northumbria Drive, Bristol. A brief scene in a pharmacy was filmed outside GK Chemists, now taken over by Lloyds Pharmacy, in St Johns Lane, Bedminster. The shop was renamed \"OK Chemists\" for the scene, in which Mike goes to buy cough medicine, but orders £180 worth of Durex condoms instead - \"Force of habit\".\n\nAll four characters attended the fictional Scumbag College. As Neil sometimes wore a University of London T-shirt, it seems likely that Scumbag is one of the University of London's constituent colleges, although they were never seen attending the institution and were rarely seen studying.\n\nThe end of the series was not the last appearance of \"The Young Ones\". For the British charity television appeal Comic Relief, the four recorded a song and video for Cliff Richard's \"Living Doll\", accompanied by Richard and Shadows guitarist Hank B. Marvin. Alexei Sayle was not involved, as he felt collaborating with Richard was against the alternative ethos of the show, but had already achieved chart success in 1984 with \"'Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?\".\n\nIn 1984, Planer released an album of music and skits in character as Neil, entitled \"Neil's Heavy Concept Album\". Musical direction was by Canterbury scene keyboardist Dave Stewart. It featured Stewart's alums Barbara Gaskin, Jakko Jakszyk, Pip Pyle, Gavin Harrison, Jimmy Hastings and Rick Biddulph. \"Hole in My Shoe\", a single taken from the LP, reached number 2. Soulwax used \"Hello Vegetables\" to kick off their Radio Soulwax mix \"Introversy.\"\n\nIn 1985, MTV aired edited versions of the episodes.\n\nAt the 1986 Comic Relief stage shows, The Young Ones performed \"Living Doll\" live (following a short skit which involved Rick doing a comic song about showing his underwear and bodily parts, before being ejected from the group by Mike, and Vyvyan supposedly having backstage sex with Kate Bush with Neil as his contraceptive). The skit climaxed with Neil claiming Cliff Richard could not perform with them as he was \"doing time\" (the musical Time was premiering the following week) and John Craven had been booked as a replacement, only for Cliff to then appear. However he was only available to appear on the second night of the run, with Bob Geldof replacing him on the other two nights.\n\nOn one occasion, Edmondson, Mayall and Planer as their \"Young Ones\" characters did a parody of the song \"My Generation\" by The Who.\n\nMayall, Planer, and Edmondson reunited in 1986 for the Elton-written \"Filthy Rich & Catflap\". The series had many of the same characteristics as \"The Young Ones\" as did Mayall and Edmondson's next sitcom \"Bottom\". Ryan, for his part, was regularly recruited to play roles on associated series (such as \"Happy Families\", \"Bottom\" and \"Absolutely Fabulous\"). Mayall, Edmondson and Planer have also appeared in episodes of \"Blackadder\".\n\nBoth series were repeated consecutively over twelve weeks in early 1985, but went unrepeated for four years, when the second series was shown on BBC2. In the mid-1990s all twelve episodes of \"The Young Ones\" were shown on BBC2 in a 30-minute revised format, missing scenes and dialogue. The series was also shown on digital channel UK Gold throughout the 1990s. A mix of both the edited and unedited versions was shown in the 2000s (decade) on UKTV G2 and Paramount Comedy 1.\n\nDVD releases were initially very basic: Only the US \"Every Stoopid Episode\" edition featured excerpts from existing documentaries, and no extra footage was included. Musical references proved difficult to clear so \"The Sounds of Silence\" (one line) and \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\" were excised from the US editions. A new DVD release of all episodes (\"Extra Stoopid Edition\") was launched in November 2007, containing new documentaries and two commentary tracks. This edition restores the line from \"The Sounds of Silence\" and \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\". The music video \"Living Doll\" featuring Cliff Richard has not been included on any edition, and neither is the live performance done for comic relief in 1986.\n\nA pilot episode was filmed of an American version of \"The Young Ones\", titled \"Oh, No! Not THEM!\". It featured Planer as Neil and Jackie Earle Haley, and had a claymation opening credit sequence. The Fox network did not pick up the series. It was produced by David Mirkin.\n\nRobert Llewellyn wrote in his book \"The Man in the Rubber Mask\" (1994):\n\nIn the episode \"Bambi\", the housemates appeared on \"University Challenge\", where they played against Footlights College, Oxbridge, a reference to the Footlights drama club at Cambridge University. The Footlights College team was played by show writer Ben Elton and three actors who were once members of the real Cambridge Footlights: Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, the last of whom had actually appeared on the quiz show while at Cambridge. The episode title is a reference to the show's presenter, Bamber Gascoigne, impersonated by Griff Rhys Jones.\n\nIn the episode \"Sick\", the quartet enter a scenario parodying \"The Good Life\", after Neil's mother says the sitcom should be more like \"The Good Life\" and Vyvyan has an outburst against it, saying, \"It's so bloody nice! Felicity 'Treacle' Kendal and Richard 'Sugar-Flavoured Snot' Briers! They're nothing but a couple of reactionary stereotypes, confirming the myth that everyone in Britain is a lovable middle-class eccentric. And I hate them!\"\n\nMayall and Edmondson elaborated on some of the series' concepts later in their sitcoms \"Filthy Rich & Catflap\" (written by Elton, with additional material by Mayall) and \"Bottom\" (written by Mayall and Edmondson. Christopher Ryan also made appearances as the character \"Dave Hedgehog\").\n\nMost of the regular cast (and several of the guests) also appeared in Channel 4 and BBC2's \"The Comic Strip Presents\" comedy shows. All four main actors went on to gain reputations as both dramatic and comic actors.\n\nIn 1990, ITV puppet series \"Spitting Image\" made reference to \"The Young Ones\" when four members of the Margaret Thatcher cabinet reminisced about their younger days, with all four playing one \"Young Ones\" character each – Cecil Parkinson as Mike, Douglas Hurd as Vyvyan, Michael Heseltine as Rick and Geoffrey Howe as Neil.\n\nWhen originally broadcast, episodes were shown on BBC2 Tuesdays at 9 pm.\n\nBoth series of \"The Young Ones\" have both been released on DVD individually and in a special edition boxset in both regions 2 and 4. Region 1 has two boxsets, one being just series 1 & 2, the other being series 1 & 2 special edition. The entire series is also available for download on iTunes,\n\nThe original VHS releases were in a set of 4, each tape containing 3 episodes. Though the Series 1 and 2 DVDs are rated 15 and three of the VHS releases were rated PG. There was also complete series 1 and complete series 2 VHS releases.\n\n\"The Young Ones\" is a video game based on the British comedy television series of the same name.\n\nThe game takes place in the students' home. The player can choose to play as either Mike, Neil, Vyvyan or Rick to explore the house and enter different rooms. The other characters become computer-controlled players. All characters can move around the house, pick up and drop objects, as well as break and fix things. The characters often talk, giving the player clues as to what the character is intended to do.\nThe aim of the game is to try and move out of the house with all the character's belongings in the shortest time possible. This is not so easy, because these possessions are typically not in their preferred condition, or are hidden around the house, and players need various tools to get to them. The other characters will move around the house, behaving in-character, occasionally moving around or further damaging the possessions - making the task harder.\n\nThe game was published by Orpheus Software, based in Hatley St George in Bedfordshire. The Young Ones characters were licensed from the owners of the BBC TV series, Rik Mayall, Ben Elton and Lise Mayer.\n\nDue to difficulty in licensing the original series music from the BBC, an alternative music sound track was commissioned to sound similar to the original theme. Over 10,000 copies of the game were sold, mainly through Boots stores, Woolworths, and independent computer stores. Due to obscure bugs in the software, it was impossible to solve the game, although few users realised this at the time. Orpheus ceased trading before the problems could be remedied.\n\n"}
{"id": "61283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61283", "title": "Zine", "text": "Zine\n\nA zine ( ; short for \"magazine\" or \"fanzine\") is a small-circulation self-published work of original or appropriated texts and images, usually reproduced via photocopier. Zines are either the product of a single person, or of a very small group and are popularly photocopied into physical prints for circulation. A fanzine (blend of \"fan\" and \"magazine\") is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by enthusiasts of a particular cultural phenomenon (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest. The term was coined in an October 1940 science fiction fanzine by Russ Chauvenet and popularized within science fiction fandom, entering the Oxford English Dictionary in 1949.\n\nPopularly defined within a circulation of 1,000 or fewer copies, in practice many zines are produced in editions of fewer than 100. Among the various intentions for creation and publication are developing one's identity, sharing a niche-skill or art, or developing a story, as opposed to seeking profit. Zines have served as a significant medium of communication in various subcultures, and frequently draw inspiration from a \"do-it-yourself\" philosophy that disregard the traditional conventions of professional design and publishing houses proposing an alternative, confident and \"self-aware\" contribution. Handwrittenzines, or carbon zines are individually made, emphasizing personal connection between creator and reader, turning imagined communities into embodied ones.\n\nWritten in a variety of formats from desktop-published text to comics, collages and stories, zines cover broad topics including fanfiction, politics, poetry, art & design, ephemera, personal journals, social theory, intersectional feminism, single-topic obsession, or sexual content far outside the mainstream enough to be prohibitive of inclusion in more traditional media. (An example of the latter is Boyd McDonald's \"Straight to Hell\", which reached a circulation of 20,000.) Although there are a few eras associated with zine-making, this \"wave\" narrative proposes a limited view of the vast range of topics, styles and environments zines occupied.\n\nDissidents and members of socially marginalized groups have published their own opinions in leaflet and pamphlet form for as long as such technology has been available. The concept of zines had an ancestor in the amateur press movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, which would in its turn cross-pollinate with the subculture of science fiction fandom in the 1930s. The popular graphic-style associated with zines is influenced artistically and politically by the subcultures of Dada, Fluxus, Surrealism and Situationism.\n\nMany trace zine's' lineage from as far back as Thomas Paine's exceptionally popular 1775 pamphlet \"Common Sense, Benjamin Franklin's\" literary magazine for psychiatric patients at a Pennsylvania hospital and \"The Dial\" (1840–44) by Margaret Fuller and Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nDuring and after the Great Depression, editors of \"pulp\" science fiction magazines became increasingly frustrated with letters detailing the impossibilities of their science fiction stories. Over time they began to publish these overly-scrutinizing letters, complete with their return addresses. Hugo Gernsback published the first science fiction magazine, \"Amazing Stories\" in 1926, and allowed for a large letter column which printed reader's addresses. By 1927 readers, often young adults, would write to each other, bypassing the magazine. This allowed these fans to begin writing to each other, now complete with a mailing list for their own science fiction fanzines that allowed them to write not only about science fiction but about fandom itself and, in self-proclaimed perzines, about themselves. Science fiction fanzines vary in content, from short stories to convention reports to fanfiction were one of the earliest incarnations of the zine and influenced subsequent publications. \"Zinesters\" like Lisa Ben and Jim Kepner honed their talents in the science fiction fandom before tackling gay rights, creating zines such as \"Vice Versa\" and \"ONE\" that drew networking and distribution ideas from their SF roots. A number of leading science fiction and fantasy authors rose through the ranks of fandom, creating \"pro-zines\" such as Frederik Pohl and Isaac Asimov. The first science fiction fanzine, \"The Comet\", was published in 1930 by the Science Correspondence Club in Chicago and edited by Raymond A. Palmer and Walter Dennis. The first version of Superman (a bald-headed villain) appeared in the third issue of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's 1933 fanzine \"Science Fiction\".\n\nThe first media fanzine was a \"Star Trek\" fan publication called \"Spockanalia\", published in September 1967 by members of the Lunarians. Some of the earliest examples of academic fandom were written on \"Star Trek\" zines, specifically K/S (Kirk/Spock) slash zines, which displayed a gay relationship between the two. Author Joanna Russ wrote in her 1985 analysis of K/S zines that slash fandom at the time consisted of around 500 core fans and was 100% female. Russ observed that while SF fans looked down on Star Trek fans, Star Trek fans looked down on K/S writers. Kirk/Spock zines contained fanfiction, artwork, and poetry created by fans. Zines were then sent to fans on a mailing list or sold at conventions. Many had high production values and some were sold at convention auctions for hundreds of dollars.\"K/S not only speaks to my condition. It is written in Female. I don't mean that literally, of course. What I mean is that I can read it without translating it from the consensual, public world, which is sexist, and unconcerned with women per se, and managing to make it make sense to me and my condition.\" \n\n\"Janus\", later called \"Aurora\", was a science fiction feminist zine created by Janice Bogstad and Jeanne Gomoll in 1975. It contained short stories, essays, and film reviews. Among its contributors were authors such as Octavia Butler, Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, and Suzette Hayden Elgin. \"Janus/Aurora\" was nominated for the Hugo Award for \"Best Fanzine\" in 1978, 1979, and 1980. \"Janus/Aurora\" was the most prominent science fiction feminist zine during its run, as well as one of the only zines that dealt with such content.\n\nComics were mentioned and discussed as early as the late 1930s in the fanzines of science fiction fandom. They often included fan artwork based on existing characters as well as discussion of the history of comics. Through the 1960s, and 1970s, comic fanzines followed some general formats, such as the industry news and information magazine (\"The Comic Reader\" was one example), interview, history and review-based fanzines, and the fanzines which basically represented independent comic book-format exercises.\n\nIn 1936, David Kyle published \" The Fantasy World \", possibly the first comics fanzine.\n\nMalcolm Willits and Jim Bradley started \"The Comic Collector's News\" in October, 1947. In 1953, Bhob Stewart published \"The EC Fan Bulletin\", which launched EC fandom of imitative EC fanzines. Among the wave of EC fanzines that followed, the best-known was Ron Parker's \"Hoo-Hah! In 1960, Richard and Pat Lupoff launched their science fiction and comics fanzine Xero and in 1961, Jerry Bails' Alter Ego, devoted to costumed heroes, became a focal point for superhero comics fandom.\n\nCalvin T. Beck's \"Journal of Frankenstein\" (later \"Castle of Frankenstein\") and Gary Svehla's \"Gore Creatures\" were the first horror fanzines created as more serious alternatives to the popular Forrest J Ackerman 1958 magazine \"Famous Monsters of Filmland.\" \"Garden Ghouls Gazette\" – a 1960s horror title under the editorship of Dave Keil, then Gary Collins—was later headed by Frederick S. Clarke and in 1967 became the respected journal \"Cinefantastique.\" It later became a prozine under journalist-screenwriter Mark A. Altman and has continued as a webzine. Richard Klemensen's \"Little Shoppe of Horrors\", having a particular focus on \"Hammer Horrors,\" began in 1972 and is still publishing as of 2017. The Baltimore-based \"Black Oracle\" (1969–1978) from writer-turned-John Waters repertory member George Stover was a diminutive zine that evolved into the larger-format \"Cinemacabre.\" Stover's \"Black Oracle\" partner Bill George published his own short-lived zine \"The Late Show\" (1974–1976; with co-editor Martin Falck), and later became editor of the \"Cinefantastique\" prozine spinoff \"Femme Fatales.\" In the mid-1970s, North Carolina teenager Sam Irvin published the horror/science-fiction fanzine \"Bizarre\" which included his original interviews with UK actors and filmmakers; Irvin would later become a producer-director in his own right. \"Japanese Fantasy Film Journal\" (JFFJ) (1968–1983) from Greg Shoemaker covered Toho's \"Godzilla\" and his Asian brethren when no other publications much cared. In 1993, \"G-FAN\" picked up where JFFJ left off, and reached its 100th regularly published issue in Fall 2012. \"FXRH\" (Special Effects by Ray Harryhausen) (1971–1976) was a specialized zine co-created by future Hollywood FX artist Ernest D. Farino.\n\nSeveral fans active in science fiction and comics fandom recognized a shared interest in rock music, and the rock fanzine was born. Paul Williams and Greg Shaw were two such SF-fans turned rock zine editors. Williams' \"Crawdaddy!\" (1966) and Shaw's two California-based zines, \"Mojo Navigator\" \"Rock and Roll News\" (1966) and \"Who Put the Bomp\" (1970), are among the most popular early rock fanzines.\n\n\"Crawdaddy!\" (1966) quickly moved from its fanzine roots to become one of the first rock music \"prozines\" with paid advertisers and newsstand distribution. \"Bomp\" remained a fanzine, featuring many writers who would later become prominent music journalists, including Lester Bangs, Greil Marcus, Ken Barnes, Ed Ward, Dave Marsh, Mike Saunders and R. Meltzer as well as cover art by Jay Kinney and Bill Rotsler (both veterans of SF and Comics fandom). Other rock fanzines of this period include \"denim delinquent\" (1971) edited by Jymn Parrett, \"Flash\" (1972) edited by Mark Shipper, \"Eurock Magazine\" (1973–1993) edited by Archie Patterson and \"Bam Balam\" written and published by Brian Hogg in East Lothian, Scotland, (1974).\n\nIn the 1980s, with the rise of stadium superstars, many home-grown rock fanzines emerged. At the peak of Bruce Springsteen's megastardom following the \"Born in the U.S.A.\" album and Born in the U.S.A. Tour in the mid-1980s, there were no less than five Springsteen fanzines circulating at the same time in the UK alone, and many others elsewhere. Gary Desmond's \"Candy's Room\", coming from Liverpool, was the first in 1980, quickly followed by Dan French's \"Point Blank\", Dave Percival's \"The Fever\", Jeff Matthews' \"Rendezvous\", and Paul Limbrick's \"Jackson Cage\". In the US, \"Backstreets Magazine\" started in Seattle in 1980 and still continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen's management and official website. \"Crème Brûlée\" documented post-rock genre and experimental music (1990s).\n\nPunk zines emerged as part of the punk subculture in the late 1970s, along with the increasing accessibility to copy machines, publishing software, and home printing technologies. Punk emerged from the United Kingdom's black subcultures and became a genre for the working class because of the economic necessity to use creative DIY methods, echoed in both zine and Punk music creation. Zines became vital to the popularization and spread of punk spreading to countries outside the UK and America, such as Ireland, Indonesia, and more by 1977. Amateur, fan-created zines played an important role in spreading information about different scenes (city or regional-based subcultures) and bands (e.g. British fanzines like Mark Perry's \"Sniffin Glue\" and Shane MacGowan's \"Bondage\") in the pre-Internet era. They typically included reviews of shows and records, interviews with bands, letters, and ads for records and labels.\n\nThe punk subculture in the United Kingdom spearheaded a surge of interest in fanzines as a countercultural alternative to established print media. The first and still best known UK 'punk zine' was \"Sniffin' Glue\", produced by Deptford punk fan Mark Perry which ran for 12 photocopied issues; the first issue produced by Perry immediately following (and in response to) the London debut of The Ramones on 4 July 1976. Other UK fanzines included \"Blam!\", \"Bombsite\", Wool City Rocker, \"Burnt Offering\", \"Chainsaw\", \"New Crimes\", \"Vague\", \"Jamming\", Artcore Fanzine, \"Love and Molotov Cocktails\", \"To Hell With Poverty\", \"New Youth\", \"Peroxide\", \"ENZK\", \"Juniper beri-beri\", \"No Cure\",\"Communication Blur\", \"Rox\", \"Grim Humour\", \"Spuno\", \"Cool Notes\" and \"Fumes\". By 1990, \"Maximum Rocknroll\" \"had become the de facto bible of the scene, presenting a \"passionate yet dogmatic view\" of what hardcore was supposed to be. \"HeartattaCk\" and \"Profane Existence\" took the DIY lifestyle to a religious level for emo and post-hardcore and crust punk culture. \"Slug and Lettuce\" started at the state college of PA and became an international 10,000 copy production - all for free. In Canada, the zine \"Standard Issue\" chronicles the Ottawa hardcore scene. The Bay Area zine \"Cometbus\" was first created at Berkeley by the zinester and musician Aaron Cometbus. \"Gearhead Nation\" was a monthly punk freesheet that lasted from the early 90's to 1997 in Dublin, Ireland. Some hardcore punk zines became available online such as the e-zine chronicling the Australian hardcore scene, \"RestAssured.\" In Italy, Mazquerade ran from 1979 to 1981 and Raw Art Fanzine ran from 1995-2000.\n\nIn the US, \"Flipside\" and \"Slash\" were important punk zines for the Los Angeles scene, both debuting in 1977. In 1977 in Australia, Bruce Milne and Clinton Walker fused their respective punk zines \"Plastered Press\" and \"Suicide Alley\" to launch \"Pulp\"; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with \"Fast Forward\", in 1980. In the American Midwest, a zine called Touch and Go described the area's hardcore scene from 1979 to 1983. We Got Power described the LA scene from 1981 to 1984, and included show reviews and band interviews with groups including DOA, the Misfits, Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies and the Circle Jerks. My Rules was a photo zine that included photos of hardcore shows from across the US an In Effect, launched in 1988 described the New York City punk scene. Among later titles, \"Maximum RocknRoll\" is a major punk zine, with over 300 issues published. As a result, in part, of the popular and commercial resurgence of punk in the late 1980s, and after, with the growing popularity of such bands as Sonic Youth, Nirvana, Fugazi, Bikini Kill, Green Day and The Offspring, a number of other punk zines have appeared, such as \"Punk Planet\", \"Razorcake\", \"Tail Spins\", \"Sobriquet\", \"Profane Existence\" and \"Slug and Lettuce\". The early American punkzine \"Search and Destroy\" eventually became the influential fringe-cultural magazine \"Re/Search\".\n\nIn the post-punk era several well-written fanzines emerged that cast an almost academic look at earlier, neglected musical forms, including Mike Stax' \"Ugly Things\", Billy Miller and Miriam Linna's \"Kicks\", Jake Austen's \"Roctober\", Kim Cooper's \"Scram\", P. Edwin Letcher's \"Garage & Beat\", and the UK's Shindig! and Italy's \"Misty Lane\". Mark Wilkins, the promotion director for 1982 onwards US punk/thrash label Mystic Records, had over 450 US fanzines and 150 foreign fanzines he promoted to regularly. He and Mystic Records owner Doug Moody edited \"The Mystic News Newsletter\" which was published quarterly and went into every promo package to fanzines. Wilkins also published the highly successful Los Angeles punk humor zine \"Wild Times\" and when he ran out of funding for the zine syndicated some of the humorous material to over 100 US fanzines under the name of Mystic Mark.\n\nDuring the 1980s and onwards, \"Factsheet Five\" (the name came from a short story by John Brunner), originally published by Mike Gunderloy and now defunct, catalogued and reviewed any zine or small press creation sent to it, along with their mailing addresses. In doing so, it formed a networking point for zine creators and readers (usually the same people). The concept of \"zine\" as an art form distinct from \"fanzine\", and of the \"zinesters\" as member of their own subculture, had emerged. Zines of this era ranged from perzines of all varieties to those that covered an assortment of different and obscure topics. Genres reviewed by Factsheet Five included quirky, medley, fringe, music, punk, grrrlz, personal, science fiction, food, humour, spirituality, politics, queer, arts & letters, comix.\n\nThe Riot Grrrl movement emerged from the DIY Punk subculture in tandem with the American era of third-wave feminism, and used the consciousness-raising method of organizing and communication. As feminist documents, they follow a longer legacy of feminist and women's self-publication that includes scrapbooking, periodicals and health publications, allowing women to circulate ideas that would not otherwise be published. The American publication \"Bikini Kill\" (1990) introduced the Riot Grrrl Manifesto in their second issue as a way of establishing space. Zinesters Erika Rienstien and May Summer founded the Riot Grrrl Press to serve as a zine distribution network that would allow riot grrrls to \"express themselves and reach large audiences without having to rely on the mainstream press\". Girls use this grassroots medium to discuss their personal lived experiences, and themes including body image, sexuality, gender norms, and violence to express anger, and reclaim/refigure femininity. Scholar and zinester Mimi Thi Nguyen notes that these norms unequally burdened riot grrrls of color with allowing white riot grrrls access to their personal experiences, an act which in itself was supposed to address systemic racism.\n\nBUST - \"The voice of the new world order\" was created by Debbie Stoller, Laurie Hanzel and Marcelle Karp in 1993 to propose an alternate to the popular mainstream magazines Cosmopolitan and Glamour. Additional zines following this path are Shocking Pink (1981–82, 1987–92), Jigsaw (1988- ), Bikini Kill (1990), Girl Germs (1990), Bamboo Girl (1995- ), BITCH Magazine (1996- ), Hip Mama (1997- ), Kitten Scratches (1999) and Rockrgrl (1995-2005).\n\nStarting in this decade, multinational companies started appropriating and commodifying zines and DIY culture. Their faux zines created a commercialized \"hipster\" lifestyle. By late in the decade, independent zinesters were accused of \"selling out\" to make a profit.\n\nBefore the invention of the printing press (1440), the Mesopotamians, Chinese and Egyptians used stamps and presses to emboss images into clay and print on cloth (BC). With the invention of paper in the second century AD, reproduction of literature became more efficient. The thirteenth century brought letterpress and relief printing to the scene, a method used to produce religious scripts. Since then, offset printing (1875), the mimeograph (1886), the duplicator/\"ditto machine\" (1920s), Xerography (1938), inkjet printing (1951), laser printing (1965), and digital printing (1991) have made the process increasingly more accessible to the general public. Comparatively, digital printing produces 2,400 times more sheets per hour than the original printing press.\n\nZines are sold, traded or given as gifts at symposiums, publishing fairs, record and book stores and concerts, via independent media outlets, zine 'distros', mail order or through direct correspondence with the author. They are also sold online on distro websites, Etsy shops, blogs, or social networking profiles and are available for download. While zines are generally self-published, there are a few independent publishers who specialize in art zines such as Nieves Books in Zurich, founded by Benjamin Sommerhalder, and Café Royal Books founded by Craig Atkinson in 2005. In recent years a number of photocopied zines have risen to prominence or professional status and have found wide bookstore and online distribution. Notable among these are \"Giant Robot\", \"Dazed & Confused\", \"Bust\", \"Bitch\", \"Cometbus\", \"Doris\", \"Brainscan\", The Miscreant, and \"Maximum RocknRoll\".\n\nThere are many catalogued and online based mail-order distros for zines. Some of the longer running and most stable operations include Last Gasp in San Francisco, Parcell Press in Philadelphia, Microcosm Publishing in Portland, Oregon, Great Worm Express Distribution in Toronto, CornDog Publishing in Ipswich in the UK, Café Royal Books in Southport in the UK, Fistful of Books in Scotland, AK Press in Oakland, California, Missing Link Records in Melbourne and Soft Skull Press in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nA number of major public and academic libraries carry zines and other small press publications, often with a specific focus (e.g. women's studies) or those that are relevant to a local region. Libraries with notable zine collections include Barnard College Library, the University of Iowa Special Collections and the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture at Duke University, which has one of the largest collections of zines on the east coast and is housed in the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book and Manuscript Library. \nThe Indie Photobook Library, an independent archive in the Washington, DC area has a large collection of photobook zines from 2010 to the present. In California, the Long Beach Public Library began to be the first public library in the state to start circulating zines for three weeks at a time in 2015. In 2017 the Los Angeles Public Library started to circulate zines publicly to its patrons as well. Both projects have been credited to librarian Ziba Zehdar who has been an advocate in promoting circulating zines publicly at libraries in California.\n\nThere has been a recent insurgence in the alternative publication culture, in tandem with the influx of zine libraries and as a result of the digital age, which has sparked zine festivals across the globe. The Los Angeles Zine Fest, which is considered to be one of the biggest in the United States started in 2012 with only a handful of exhibitors, now hosting over 200 exhibitors. Other big zine fests across the globe include, San Francisco Zine Fest, Brooklyn Zine Fest, Chicago Zine Fest Feminist Zine Fest, Amsterdam Zine Jam, and Sticky Zine Fair. At each zine fest, the zinester can be their own independent distributor and publisher simply by standing behind a table to sell or barter their work. Over time, zinesters have added posters, stickers, buttons and patches to these events. In many libraries, schools and community centers around the world, Zinesters hold meetings to create, share, and pass down the art of making zines.\n\nWith the rise of the Internet in the mid-1990s, zines initially faded from public awareness possibly due to the ability of private web-pages to fulfill much the same role of personal expression. Indeed, many zines were transformed into Webzines, such as Boingboing or monochrom. The metadata standard for cataloging zines is \"xZineCorex\", which maps to Dublin Core. E-zine creators were originally referred to as \"adopters\" because of their use of pre-made type and layouts, making the process less ambiguous. Since, social media, blogging and vlogging have adopted a similar do-it-yourself publication model, with the most efficient form of communication yet.\n\nIn the UK \"Fracture\" and \"Reason To Believe\" were significant fanzines in the early 2000s, both ending in late 2003. \"Rancid News\" filled the gap left by these two zines for a short while. On its tenth issue \"Rancid News\" changed its name to \"Last Hours\" with 7 issues published under this title before going on hiatus. \"Last Hours\" still operates as a webzine though with more focus on the anti-authoritarian movement than its original title. \"Artcore Fanzine\" (established in 1986) continues to this day, recently publishing a number of 30 year anniversary issues.\n\nThe Usenet newsgroup \"alt.zines\" was created in 1992 by Jerod Pore and Edward Vielmetti for the discussion of zines and zine-related topics. Since that time, alt.zines has seen more than 26,000 postings. Throughout the 1990s alt.zines was the only online forum for zinesters to promote, talk, and discuss small publishing issues and tips. It was a place where a zine reader or first time publisher could rub elbows with infamous zinesters.\n\nAn open-source wiki site solely for zines, small press publications and independent media as well as their history. The online encyclopedia for zines was launched in 2006 by Alan Lastufka and Kate Sandler.\n\nTwo popular kids shows in the late 1990s – early 2000s featured zine-making: \"Our Hero\" (2000–02) and \"Rocket Power\" (1999-2004). The main character in \"Our Hero\", Kale Stiglic, writes about her life in the Toronto suburbs. The episodes are narrated and presented in the form of zine issues that she creates, inheriting her father's storytelling passion. The show won titles from the Canadian Comedy Awards and Gemini Awards during its development.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49283143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49283143", "title": "Zitong dictionary", "text": "Zitong dictionary\n\nThe (1254) Zitong 字通 or Mastery of Characters is a Chinese dictionary of orthography that was compiled by the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279) scholar Li Congzhou 李從周. It discussed logographic differences among Chinese characters written in the ancient Qin dynasty seal script, standard Han dynasty clerical script, and contemporary Song regular script.\n\nThe title combines two common words: \"zì\" 字 \"character; script; writing; graph; style\" and \"tōng\" 通 \"communicate/connect (with); join; understand thoroughly; master\". While the title is usually transliterated as \"Zitong\" or \"Tzu-t'ung\", English translations are \"Summary of Characters\" (Zhou and Zhang 2003: 72), \"General Dictionary of Chinese Characters\" (Yong and Peng (2008: 198), and \"(A Scholar) Versed in Characters\" (Theobald 2013).\n\nLi Congzhou's choice of title was the name of an earlier character dictionary that is now a lost work: the (c. 500) \"Zitong\" 字通 by Yang Chengqing 楊承慶 of the Northern Wei dynasty. It contained 13,734 character head entries, which was more than the (c. 350) \"Zilin\" with 12,824 entries (Zhou and Zhang 2003: 72; Lin 2008). Yang's \"Zitong\" has been partially reconstructed from fragments of early texts and quotations in classical texts (Xu 2013).\n\nThe similarly titled (1671) \"Zhengzitong\" 正字通 \"Correct Character Mastery\" (with \"zhèng\" 正 \"right; straight; correct\") was published by Qing dynasty scholar Liao Wenying 廖文英, who bought and renamed the (1627) \"Zihui bian\" 字彙辯 \"\"Zihui\" Disputations\", which was written by the Ming dynasty author Zhang Zilie 張自烈 as a supplement to the (1615) \"Zihui\" dictionary.\n\nFurthermore, the Japanese lexicographer Shirakawa Shizuka 白川静 edited an identically titled (1996) \"Jitsū\" 字通 \"Mastery of Characters\" Japanese dictionary.\n\nIn an alphabetic language like English, orthography means \"Correct or proper spelling; spelling according to accepted usage; the way in which words are conventionally written. (By extension) Any mode or system of spelling.\" (\"OED\" 2009, v. 4.0). When semantically extended into a logographic language like Chinese, it means \"the way in which Chinese characters are conventionally written\", which includes calligraphic aspects such as the script styles, stroke order, and character structure.\n\nThe first Chinese orthographic dictionaries, or \"'character model' dictionaries\", were compiled during the Tang dynasty (618–907) in an effort to rectify discrepancies among characters written in seal, clerical, and regular scripts, and to standardize variant characters (Yong and Peng 2008: 197, 177). Emperor Taizong of Tang put the scholar and calligrapher Yan Shigu (581–645) in charge of the Palace Library in order to \"verify and authorize\" the \"Five Classics\" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 194). The Archival Bureau's duties were to print authoritative editions of the classic works, to collate the styles of characters, to check and proofread government texts, and to produce a standard orthographic handbook. This became the first Chinese orthographic dictionary, Yan Shigu's book the \"Zìyàng\" 字樣 \"Character Models\" (aka \"Yanshi ziyang\" 顏氏字樣 \"Mr. Yan's Character Models\") gave model samples of writing characters in different scripts, which his grandson Yan Yuansun 顏元孫 (d. 732) used as the basis for his \"Ganlu Zishu\" orthographic dictionary.\n\nIn addition to the \"Zitong\", various orthography dictionaries and character books were published during the Song dynasty (960–1279), for instance, the \"Fugubian\" 复古編 \"Return to Old Chapters\" by Zhang You 張有 and the \"Peixi\" 佩觿 \"Ivory Bodkin\" by the painter Guo Zhongshu.\n\nThe \"Zitong\" was in one volume, and based upon the classic (121) \"Shuowen jiezi\" character dictionary. It included 601 character head entries, which were arranged into 89 sections according to the number of strokes in the regular script. The head character was in seal script and entries were in regular script, giving notation first, followed by the definition. All the exegetic interpretations quote the \"Shuowen jiezi\" without any other sources.\n\nThere were flaws in the \"Zitong\", such as listing some characters twice and inconsistencies in the 89-radical system. It did have a useful appendix with 82 popular erroneous writings, such as \"yīchang\" 衣常 instead of \"yīshang\" 衣裳 \"clothing; clothes\" (Theobald 2013). Nevertheless, this dictionary was important for the study of lexicographical theories concerning dictionary compilation in the Song Dynasty (Yong and Peng 2008: 198).\n\n\n"}
