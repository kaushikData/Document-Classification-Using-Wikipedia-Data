Members of these military units have been accused of perpetrating human rights abuses against local villagers. Fearing for the lives of its employees after a series of attacks, ExxonMobil shut down its Arun natural gas operations in Aceh in March 2001. In 2015, ExxonMobil sold its Aceh operations to Pertamina. The company denies these accusations; its primary defense is that the human rights violations which were occurring were not a result of specific intention of the organization and therefore it cannot be held liable.\n\nAceh is located on the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The region is rich in natural resources, including oil and natural gas. In 1992, it was reported that Aceh provided 15% of Indonesia's total exports, and the value of the oil and gas fields was estimated in 2003 to generate US$1.2-1.5 billion annually.\n\nIn 1968, Mobil began operating the Arun gas fields, which are owned by the Indonesian state oil company, Pertamina. In 1971, Mobil Oil Indonesia discovered massive reserves of natural gas in north Aceh, which led to the creation of the Lhokesemawe Industrial Zone (ZILS). After Exxon bought Mobil in 1999, the merged company, which is based in Irving, Texas, took over the management of Arun. The gas fields there, until their closing in March, contributed to the Indonesian budget with about $1 billion in revenue annually. Aceh, the home for the natural gas field has been witnessing an armed resistance organized under the banner of the Free Aceh Movement. From 1989 to 1998, the Indonesian government designated Aceh as a Military Operation Area, with thousands of troops assigned to defeat the armed independence force.\n\nThe International Labor Rights Fund took on the cause of people claiming to be victims of abuse. In 2001, ILRF filed an ATCA claim in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of 11 villagers from Aceh claiming to be victims of human rights abuses by security forces hired by ExxonMobil. The suit alleges that ExxonMobil employed military troops to protect its operations, and aided and abetted human rights violations through financial and other material support to the security forces. In addition, the suit alleges that the security forces are either employees or agents of Exxon Mobil, and thus Exxon Mobil is liable for their actions.\n\nIn 2005 a US federal judge ruled that the case could proceed on District of Columbia state law claims, including wrongful death, theft by coercion and assault and battery, but dismissed claims under the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Torture Victim Protection Act. In 2006 a motion to dismiss filed by ExxonMobil was dismissed, as was an appeal in 2007. In 2008 the US Supreme court, having invited the US Solicitor General to comment, declined to hear an appeal. In 2009 the District Court accepted Exxon's motion to dismiss, based on lack of standing by the plaintiffs' in a US court; this was revered in 2011 by the appeals court.\n\nIn 2014, a US federal court decided that the case could proceed; in 2015 that the claims sufficiently \"touch and concern\" the United States that they may proceed in US court.\n\n"}
{"id": "28151955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28151955", "title": "Afghan War documents leak", "text": "Afghan War documents leak\n\nThe Afghan War documents leak, also called the Afghan War Diary, is the disclosure of a collection of internal U.S. military logs of the War in Afghanistan, which were published by WikiLeaks on 2010. The logs consist of over 91,000 Afghan War documents, covering the period between January 2004 and December 2009. Most of the documents are classified secret. As of 28 July 2010, only 75,000 of the documents have been released to the public, a move which WikiLeaks says is \"part of a harm minimization process demanded by [the] source\". Prior to releasing the initial 75,000 documents, WikiLeaks made the logs available to \"The Guardian\", \"The New York Times\" and \"Der Spiegel\" in its German and English online edition, which published reports per previous agreement on that same day, 25 July 2010.\n\nThe leak, which is considered to be one of the largest in U.S. military history, revealed information on the deaths of civilians, increased Taliban attacks, and involvement by Pakistan and Iran in the insurgency. WikiLeaks says it does not know the source of the leaked data. The three outlets which had received the documents in advance, \"The New York Times\", \"The Guardian\", and \"Der Spiegel\", have all concluded that they are genuine when compared with independent reports.\n\n\"The New York Times\" described the leak as \"a six-year archive of classified military documents [that] offers an unvarnished and grim picture of the Afghan war\". \"The Guardian\" called the material \"one of the biggest leaks in U.S. military history ... a devastating portrait of the failing war in Afghanistan, revealing how coalition forces have killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents, Taliban attacks have soared and NATO commanders fear neighbouring Pakistan and Iran are fuelling the insurgency\". \"Der Spiegel\" wrote that \"the editors in chief of \"Spiegel\", \"The New York Times\" and the \"Guardian\" were 'unanimous in their belief that there is a justified public interest in the material'.\"\n\nSome time after the first dissemination by WikiLeaks, the U.S. Justice Department considered using the U.S. Espionage Act of 1917 to prevent WikiLeaks from posting the remaining 15,000 secret war documents it claimed to possess.\n\nIn June 2010, \"Guardian\" journalist Nick Davies and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange established that the U.S. Army had built a huge database with six years of sensitive military intelligence material, to which many thousands of U.S. soldiers had access and some of them had been able to download copies, and WikiLeaks had one copy which it proposed to publish online, via a series of uncensorable global servers. Some of the soldiers were not supposed to have any access as they were not involved in those operations.\n\nWikiLeaks describes itself as \"a multi-jurisdictional public service designed to protect whistleblowers, journalists and activists who have sensitive materials to communicate to the public\". In an interview with the UK's Channel 4, Assange said that \"we have a stated commitment to a particular kind of process and objective, and that commitment is to get censored material out and never to take it down\". He contrasted the group with other media outlets by saying that \"other journalists try to verify sources. We don't do that, we verify documents. We don't care where it came from.\" He denied that the group has an inherent bias against the Afghanistan War, saying that \"We don't have a view about whether the war should continue or stop – we do have a view that it should be prosecuted as humanely as possible.\" However, he also said that he believes the leaked information will turn world public opinion to think more negatively of the war.\n\nAn Obama administration statement disputed the self-reported status of WikiLeaks, stating that it \"is not an objective news outlet but rather an organization that opposes U.S. policy in Afghanistan\". Journalist Will Heaven of \"The Daily Telegraph\" has said that WikiLeaks was not politically neutral when it fed its information to the left-leaning newspapers \"The Guardian\", \"The New York Times\", and \"Der Spiegel\" instead of releasing the data openly. He said that the selectivity of the leak \"contravene[d] its own mission statement – that crowdsourcing and open data are paramount\". The \"Toronto Sun\" has referred to Assange's statements \"This material shines light on the everyday brutality and squalor of war\" and \"The archive will change public opinion and it will change the opinion of people in positions of political and diplomatic influence\" as evidence that he has an anti-war mission.\n\nAccording to \"Der Spiegel\", \"the documents clearly show that the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (usually known as the ISI) is the most important accomplice the Taliban has outside of Afghanistan\". \"The New York Times\" was especially alarmed by the level of collusion with the Taliban, having concluded that Pakistan \"allows representatives of its spy service to meet directly with the Taliban in secret strategy sessions to organize networks of militant groups that fight against American soldiers in Afghanistan, and even hatch plots to assassinate Afghan leaders\". \"The Guardian\", however, did not think there was \"a convincing smoking gun\" for complicity between Pakistan intelligence services and the Taliban.\n\nIn particular, the leaks discuss an alleged incident in which Pakistan's former ISI spy chief Hamid Gul met with Afghan insurgents in January 2009, occurring right after alleged Pakistani al-Qaeda figure Osama al-Kini's death by a CIA drone attack. \"The meeting attendees were saddened by the news of Zamarai's death and discussed plans to complete Zamarai's last mission by facilitating the movement of a suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device from Pakistan to Afghanistan through the Khan Pass\", leaked reports said. \"The New York Times\" stated that it could not confirm whether or not that the attack ever took place.\n\nThe initial web article in \"The New York Times\" on the subject, appearing 25 July was written by Mark Mazzetti, Jane Perlez, Eric Schmitt, and Andrew Lehren, and titled \"Pakistan Spy Service Aids Insurgents, Reports Assert\". It was the lead article in the 26 July print edition of the \"Times\". The article provided a wide range of excerpts from the paper, at some points focusing on coalition successes, and at other times excerpting sections that highlighted coalition failures. Many of the excerpts illustrated American frustration with local involvement, quoting the sources, noting that \"glimpses of what appear to be Pakistani skullduggery contrast sharply with the frequently rosy public pronouncements of Pakistan as an ally by American officials\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" had a very different take. Its Sunday, 25 July 2010 article by Declan Walsh states: \n\nBut for all their eye-popping details, the intelligence files, which are mostly collated by junior officers relying on informants and Afghan officials, fail to provide a convincing smoking gun for ISI complicity. Most of the reports are vague, filled with incongruent detail, or crudely fabricated. The same characters – famous Taliban commanders, well-known ISI officials – and scenarios repeatedly pop up. And few of the events predicted in the reports subsequently occurred. A retired senior American officer said ground-level reports were considered to be a mixture of \"rumours, bullshit and second-hand information\" and were weeded out as they passed up the chain of command.\n\nThe Obama administration, in response to the leaks, re-expressed their long-held doubts about links between Pakistan intelligence agents and Afghan insurgents. An anonymous official said to Al Arabiya, \"I don't think anyone who follows this issue will find it surprising that there are concerns about ISI and safe havens in Pakistan\".\n\nEvidence that Iran provided extensive assistance to the Taliban was also revealed. Coming from sources such as Afghan spies and paid informants, Iranian involvement in Afghanistan steadily widened from 2004 to today and constituted armaments, money, and physical deployment of anti-NATO militants. The government of Iran denies supporting the militants.\n\nThe documents, wrote journalist Jeff Stein of the \"Washington Post\", stated that Hezb-e-Islami party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Amin al-Haq, a financial advisor to Osama Bin Laden, both flew to North Korea on 19 November 2005, and purchased remote-controlled rockets to be used against American and coalition aircraft. Stein cautioned that he has found no corroborating reports of North Korean involvement in Taliban armaments dealing.\n\nHundreds of civilians have been wounded or killed by coalition forces in several instances that were not previously revealed. The press listed several examples of such previously unreported incidents of civilian injuries and deaths. David Leigh of \"The Guardian\" wrote: \n\nIn one incident, a U.S. patrol machine-gunned a bus, wounding or killing 15 of its passengers.\n\nOn 4 March 2007, in the Shinwar shooting, U.S. Marines opened fire on civilians after witnessing a suicide bombing and supposedly coming under small arms fire. \"The Guardian\" reported their actions: \n\nThe marines made a frenzied escape [from the scene of the bombing], opening fire with automatic weapons as they tore down a six-mile stretch of highway, hitting almost anyone in their way – teenage girls in the fields, motorists in their cars, old men as they walked along the road. Nineteen unarmed civilians were killed and 50 wounded.\n\nThe military report of the incident (written by the same soldiers involved in it) later failed to make any reference to the deaths and injuries and none of the soldiers involved were charged or disciplined.\n\nOn 21 March 2007, CIA paramilitaries fired on a civilian man who was running from them. The man, Shum Khan, was deaf and mute and did not hear their warnings.\n\nIn 2007, documents detail how U.S. special forces dropped six 2,000 lb bombs on a compound where they believed a \"high-value individual\" was hiding, after \"ensuring there were no innocent Afghans in the surrounding area\". A senior U.S. commander reported that 150 Taliban had been killed. Locals, however, reported that up to 300 civilians had died.\n\nOn 16 August 2007, Polish troops mortared the village of Nangar Khel, killing five people – including a woman and her baby – in what \"The Guardian\" described as an apparent revenge attack shortly after experiencing an IED explosion.\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", the logs also detail \"how the Taliban have caused growing carnage with a massive escalation of their roadside bombing campaign, which has killed more than 2,000 civilians to date\".\n\nA significant number of documents describe unreported or previously misleading friendly fire incidents between Afghan police and army forces, coalition forces, and the U.S. military.\n\nA document dating 3 September 2006 suggests that four Canadian soldiers died in the Panjwaye District of Afghanistan during Operation Medusa, when an American jet dropped a bomb on a building they occupied during the second day of the operation. Seven other Canadian soldiers and one civilian were also reported wounded in the attack. At the time, the Canadian military reported that the deaths and injuries were caused by a firefight with the Taliban, which it still insists. Michel Drapeau, a former colonel with the Canadian Forces, commented that the document is disturbing, due to it differing from the military's report at the time of the soldiers' deaths, which could make the document incorrect. The Canadian military insists it had not been misleading facts about deaths of Canadian soldiers. Former Chief of the Defence Staff Rick Hillier also rejects the document and maintains the deaths were due to enemy fire, as do some of the deceased soldiers' families.\n\nA document from 11 June 2007 details an incident where Task Force 373 engaged in a firefight with what were believed to be insurgents. An airstrike was called in, which killed seven Afghan police officers, and injured four others. Nangarhar Province governor Gul Agha Sherzai had labelled the incident a misunderstanding.\n\nLess than 48 hours after the documents were leaked, the UK's Ministry of Defense released a statement announcing a new friendly fire death in Afghanistan. \n\nThe Ministry had previously announced an investigation into a friendly fire incident in 2009 in Helmand province.\n\nThe war logs made clear that suicide bombing, generally carried out by non-Afghan foreign fighters, was increasing and claim that they were nurtured by al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, whose influence was pervasive and possibly growing. A report generated September 2004 stated that terrorists had been assigned by Bin Laden to conduct a suicidal attack against the Afghan president Hamid Karzai, during a press conference or a meeting held. Another report, in September 2008, spoke of coordinated, multinational al-Qaeda attack planning. More suicide bombings allegedly were planned with al-Qaeda's Afghan allies, such as the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin militia led by the notorious warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Numerous reports linked Bin Laden and al-Qaeda to insurgent activities. In one report, al-Qaeda was claimed to be involved in a plan to manufacture chemical weapons payloads for rocket-propelled grenades.\n\nGovernment accounts of coalition activity were, according to \"The Guardian\", sometimes \"misleading\". The British paper cited as an example a press statement that concealed the fact that the real reason for a coalition presence in a particular area was because a group known as Task Force 373 was on a mission to kill or capture Abu Laith al-Libi. \"The New York Times\" reported that the United States had given Afghans credit for missions actually carried out by Special Operations commandos.\"The New York Times\" said \"over all, the documents do not contradict official accounts of the war. But in some cases the documents show that the American military made misleading public statements\".\n\nThe records log 144 incidents regarding Task Force 373 and involving Afghan civilian casualties, including 195 deaths.\n\nThe leak lends hard numbers such as prisoner head counts and prisoner transfer dates to existing journalistic concerns around certain detainment facilities, such as Bagram Theater Internment Facility, and their practices.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that the documents reveal the Taliban have used heat-seeking missiles to down coalition aircraft. The U.S. military had not previously acknowledged that the Taliban possessed these weapons.\n\nSome, including Barack Obama and Hamid Karzai, raised concerns that the detailed logs had exposed the names of Afghan informants, thereby endangering their lives. Partially in response to this criticism, Julian Assange claimed that WikiLeaks had sought the help of the White House, via \"The New York Times\", in redacting the names of 'innocent' people but that this request had been denied. However, \"New York Times\" reporter, Eric Schmitt, who was acting as an intermediary between WikiLeaks and the White House, told the \"Associated Press\" that, \"I certainly didn't consider this a serious and realistic offer to the White House to vet any of the documents before they were to be posted, and I think it's ridiculous that Assange is portraying it that way now.\" WikiLeaks spokesperson, Daniel Schmitt, told \"The Daily Beast\" that they had sought the help of the Department of Defense in reviewing a further 15,000 documents for redactions before releasing them but Marine Colonel David Lapan, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Defense, said they had not been contacted by WikiLeaks. Julian Assange later told an Associated Press reporter in Sweden that WikiLeaks had contacted the Department of Defense's chief legal counsel, via its lawyers—a claim that was denied by Bryan Whitman, a spokesman for Defense Secretary, Robert Gates. However, a letter, written by General Counsel of the Department of Defense, Jeh Charles Johnson, in reply to WikiLeaks' attorney, Timothy Matusheski, was later released (either by the Department of Defense or WikiLeaks), in which Johnson identified the names of Afghan informants as 'sensitive items' but, in keeping with Bryan Whitman's later public statement, stated that: \n\nAsked by \"The Daily Beast\" why WikiLeaks did not review all of the documents and make redactions where necessary before their release, Daniel Schmitt replied that the volume of documents made it impossible.\n\nSpeaking to \"Channel 4 News\", official spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, said that the Taliban would study the released documents in order to discover and punish informants. \n\nWhen Assange was questioned about this statement by Amy Goodman in a \"Democracy Now!\" interview, he responded, \n\nFormer WikiLeaks volunteer, Smári McCarthy, told \"The Independent\", 'there were serious disagreements over the decision not to redact the names of Afghan civilians'. \"Guardian\" journalist, David Leigh, claimed that Julian Assange initially refused to redact the names of informants. In his book, co-authored with Luke Harding, \"\", Leigh claimed Assange to have said in relation to whether the names should be redacted, \"Well, they're informants. So, if they get killed, they've got it coming to them. They deserve it.\" In response to the book's publication, WikiLeaks posted on Twitter: \"\"The Guardian\" book serialization contains malicious libels. We will be taking action.\" When Douglas Murray relayed these comments in a debate, Assange interjected \"We are in the process of suing \"The Guardian\" in relation to that comment.\" \"The Guardian\" claimed the following day that they had 'not received any notification of such action from WikiLeaks or its lawyers', two months after the publication of the book.\n\nEvidence within the documents suggest that the U.S. military has been paying Afghan radio and print media to run favorable stories, with two prominent examples being Radio Ghaznawiyaan and Wakht News Agency. One document refers to supplying pre-made content to a radio station, describing that content as psychological operations/psychological warfare (PSYOP) material.\n\nThe leaked documents describe many purported incidents of Taliban and other Afghan insurgent forces attacking civilians. Those forces would also, according to leaked reports, post \"Night Letters\" on civilian buildings such as mosques foretelling death for the inhabitants. In one leak from April 2007, Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Karen Hughes requests to verify a video of a 12-year-old child soldier forced to kill a Pakistani hostage. Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, remarked that \"the documents demonstrate just how pervasive the Taliban's brutality is in this fight\".\n\nThe documents revealed that contractors for the U.S. Department of Defense had hired local male child prostitutes.\n\nJulian Assange said \"it is the most comprehensive history of a war ever to be published, during the course of the war\". He compared the release of the war logs with the release of the Pentagon Papers in the 1970s. In an interview with \"Der Spiegel\", Assange said that he believed the release would \"change public opinion\", and said that \"we understand why it is important to protect certain U.S. and ISAF sources\". He added that \"the most dangerous men are those who are in charge of war. And they need to be stopped.\" Assange also claimed that the files \"suggest thousands of war crimes\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" described the war logs as \"a six-year archive of classified military documents [that] offers an unvarnished and grim picture of the Afghan war\".\n\nOn the decision to publish, they stated:\n\n\"The Guardian\" called the material \"one of the biggest leaks in U.S. military history...a devastating portrait of the failing war in Afghanistan, revealing how coalition forces have killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents, Taliban attacks have soared and NATO commanders fear neighbouring Pakistan and Iran are fuelling the insurgency\".\n\n\"The Guardian\" also reported that Daniel Ellsberg has described the disclosure as on the scale of his leaking of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 revealing how the U.S. public was misled about the Vietnam War.\n\n\"Der Spiegel\" wrote that \"the editors in chief of \"Spiegel\", \"The New York Times\" and the \"Guardian\" were 'unanimous in their belief that there is a justified public interest in the material.\n\nU.S. Army officials condemned the public dissemination of military secrets and the White House urged the website WikiLeaks to not publish any more classified documents related to the Afghan war. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that it is up to the Justice Department to determine if there would be criminal charges in the release of classified military documents by WikiLeaks, but the website was \"morally guilty for putting lives at risk\".\n\nOn 6 August 2010, U.S. military authorities urged Wikileaks to return the already published 70,000 documents, and the other 15,000 records the website was expected to post soon as well, which contained sensitive details of Afghans who had assisted ISAF forces. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said \"If doing the right thing is not good enough for them, then we will figure out what alternatives we have to compel them to do the right thing.\" On 7 August 2010, spokesman Daniel Schmitt said that WikiLeaks would continue to publish secret files from governments around the world despite the U.S. demands to cancel plans for further release, claiming that this directly contributed to the public's understanding of the conflict and rejecting allegations that the publication was a threat to America's national security or put lives at risk.\n\nAccording to a statement by Rangin Dadfar Spanta, security advisor to the Afghan government and a former Minister of Foreign Affairs, the allies of Afghanistan had failed to pay necessary attention to prevent the support for international terrorism and to eliminate its hideouts and centres that can create a major threat to security and stability in the region. \"The content of these documents reveal that Afghanistan has been righteous in its stance about the rise of terrorism and political and military discrepancies in counter-terrorism struggle\".\n\nDaniel Markey, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations and former South Asia analyst for the Bush administration, said, \n\nWhether WikiLeaks uncovered anything new isn't actually important – it's on the front page of every newspaper in the country; the media is now focused on Afghanistan, and that makes it a big deal. [...] The public is now more skeptical about the administration's strategy in Afghanistan than they were last week, and that makes it real.\n\nAn editorial in the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated that comparisons to the Pentagon Papers was an exaggeration as the documents lacked the policy implications of the papers, but that \"no democracy can or should fight a war without the consent of its people, and that consent is only meaningful if it is predicated on real information\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" did seem to indicate the documents have parallels with the Pentagon Papers in being published during a subsequent administration \"the documents offer insight primarily into the war-fighting of the recently departed George W. Bush administration; the Pentagon Papers ended with the Johnson administration and were not published until Richard Nixon was president.\"\n\nAn editorial in \"The Washington Post \"stated \"they hardly provide a secret history of the war or disclose previously unknown malfeasance\" and that \"tends to fill out and confirm the narrative of Afghanistan between 2004 and 2009 that most Americans are already familiar with\". \"The Post\" commented that it hardly merited the media hype and was not comparable to the Pentagon Papers or the MfS files. The editorial argued that WikiLeaks' founder revealed his organization's antiwar agenda by making the claim it contained evidence for prosecuting war crimes.\n\nBlake Hounshell wrote in his blog on \"Foreign Policy\" that, after reading \"selected documents\", he believed that there is less new information in the documents than \"The New York Times\", \"The Guardian\", and \"Der Spiegel\" were reporting. Hounshell indicated how careful both \"The Guardian\" and \"The New York Times\" were to note \"the raw reports in the Wikileaks archive often seem poorly sourced and present implausible information\". Commenting on the significance of the documents:\n\nAnn Woolner wrote in an editorial in \"Bloomberg\" that WikiLeaks' publication of the documents is legally allowed in the United States because the group did not solicit the documents. Asking someone to leak secret information, \"with intent or reason to believe that the information to be obtained is to be used to the injury of the United States\", would violate the United States' Espionage Act of 1917 In violation of the post-World War I accord.\n\n An official from the European Union has told The Associated Press \"that the organization 'wants to stay as far from this as possible.\n\nAnother document suggests that a Canadian was among the casualties in a helicopter that was destroyed by heat-seeking missiles. The document indicates that the United States wanted Canada to put pressure on Saudi Arabia and South Africa, where the United States believed Taliban fundraising was taking place. The documents claim that American diplomats spoke with two senior Canadian Foreign Affairs officials in their appeal for the Canadian government to join the U.S. government in issuing a joint diplomatic rebuke to Saudi Arabia and South Africa. The documents also allege that Canada was asked to rebuke the United Arab Emirates independently over alleged militant fundraising.\n\nOne document suggests that a Canadian C-130 Hercules was hit with an anti-aircraft weapon fired by the Taliban during takeoff. The document states that the C-130's landing gear and some of its fuselage was destroyed by a 14.5 mm round as the aircraft departed from the western province of Farah, with the report stating, \"It is unusual that insurgents would engage aircraft in such close proximity to an airfield with a weapon of this caliber.\" The documents also say that a number of Canadian unmanned drones have crashed and that in one instance, locals removed a vehicle's technology before soldiers could recover it.\n\nCannon refused to comment on the documents, saying that they had \"nothing to do with Canada\" and denied the Canadian government was misleading its citizens on the war in Afghanistan. New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton said that the documents \"undermines the confidence\" Canadian citizens have in their government and called on politicians to \"get to the bottom of\" the situation regarding the friendly fire report.\n\nThe Greens also showed distrust in the federal government over the lack of disclosure of U.S. special forces activities in German-controlled areas. Omid Nouripour, the security spokesman for the party, said, \"On our reading of the U.S. documents, it is disturbing how little the federal government has informed the parliament about the activities of American special forces in German areas. We demand an immediate explanation from the federal government as to what they know about the missions. We will push with all force for answers.\"\n\nA senior ISI official denied the allegations, saying they were from raw intelligence reports that had not been verified and were meant to impugn the reputation of the spy agency. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with the agency's policy. Former ISI Chief Hamid Gul, who headed the agency in the late 1980s when Pakistan and the United States were supporting militants in their fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan, denied the allegations that he was working with the Taliban, saying \"these leaked documents against me are fiction and nothing else\".\n\nPoliticians and defense analysts critically commented on leaks and the western media in using the ISI card while not highlighting most of the civilian casualties resulting from bombing of NATO forces like how U.S. special forces dropped six 2,000 lb bombs on a compound where they believed a \"high-value individual\" was hiding, after \"ensuring there were no innocent Afghans in the surrounding area\". In fact, up to 300 civilians had died in those attacks.\n\n\nTaliban – spokesperson, Zabihullah Mujahid, has stated they are inspecting the leaked documents which contain the names, tribes, and family information of Afghan informants who were helping the United States. \"We knew about the spies and people who collaborate with U.S. forces\", he said. \"We will investigate through our own secret service whether the people mentioned are really spies working for the United States. If they are U.S. spies, then we know how to punish them\". This statement comes after the Taliban has recently begun intimidating and brutally executing those who cooperate with NATO forces.\n\nA coalition of five human-rights organizations addressed Julian Assange, founder and editor of WikiLeaks, expressing concerns for the safety of persons identified in the published documents. These human-rights groups were Amnesty International, Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict (CIVIC), Open Society Institute (OSI), the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) and the Kabul office of the International Crisis Group (ICG), all worried about the execution of Afghan civilians by the Taliban and other insurgent groups. The AIHRC published figures showing that executions had soared in the first seven months of 2010 to 197, from a total of 225 in all of 2009. The victims were often persons who supported the Afghan government, or their family members, who may have come into contact with the U.S. or other international forces.\n\nOn 12 August 2010, the international press watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RWB) accused WikiLeaks of \"incredible irresponsibility\" after the website said it \"absolutely\" would release the remaining 15,000 documents. In an open letter to Assange, Jean-François Julliard, RWB secretary-general, and Clothilde Le Coz, RWB's representative in Washington, D.C., wrote that the publication was \"highly dangerous\", particularly when it named Afghan informants.\n\nThe publication of the book \"WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy\" forced Assange's hand. The authors inadvertently divulged the entire set of unredacted documents by including the decryption key for those documents in their book. Once decrypted portions of these documents started appearing across the Internet , Assange decided that the most responsible course of action was to simply make them available through WikiLeaks.\n\nWikiLeaks originally said it did not know the source of the leaked data. Julian Assange stated, \"Our whole system is designed such that we don't have to keep that secret\". The Pentagon launched an inquiry; Colonel Dave Lapan, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, said that investigators were trying to determine who leaked the material and said that Chelsea Manning, a 22-year-old U.S. Army intelligence analyst, was someone they were \"looking at closely\" in 2010. In August 2013, Manning was convicted of espionage and other charges for disclosing the Baghdad airstrike video of 2007 (known as \"Collateral Murder\"), the diplomatic cables leak of 2010 (known as \"Cablegate\"), and other classified information. That video was made public through WikiLeaks, along with many diplomatic cables, but war logs were not specifically among the charges against Manning at the time.\n\nOn 30 July, a few days after the initial disclosure, media began to report that WikiLeaks had released an additional file named \"insurance.aes256\" in connection with the Afghan War Diary disclosure. The new \"insurance file\" was AES-256 encrypted, 1.4 GB in size, with a timestamp of 31 December 2010 6:00 PM, and with a SHA1 checksum of \"cce54d3a8af370213d23fcbfe8cddc8619a0734c\". It is also available at the Internet Archive.\n\nAt 1.4 GB, that file was 20 times larger than the batch of 77,000 secret U.S. military documents about Afghanistan that WikiLeaks already published, and cryptographers said that the file was virtually impossible to crack, unless WikiLeaks releases the key used to encode the material.\n\n"}
{"id": "40819697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40819697", "title": "African art in Western collections", "text": "African art in Western collections\n\nBetween 1890 and 1918, Western colonial expansion in Africa led to the removal of many pieces of sub-Saharan African art that were subsequently brought to Europe and displayed. These objects entered the collections of natural history museums, art museums (both encyclopedic and specialist) and private collections in Europe and the United States.\n\nBefore the Berlin Conference of 1885, traders and explorers to Africa bought or stole art as souvenirs and curios, speading beyond the coast; ivory objects made along African coasts had been collected for centuries, and many were made by Africans for European markets in a style matching European taste, mainly in areas reached by the Portuguese, the Afro-Portuguese ivories. The period dominated by curio collecting, in which objects served as souvenirs, was followed by a period of trophy collecting in which large collections of artifacts (mostly weapons), and animal skins, horns, and tusks from hunting expeditions, were a tangible means of showing penetration, conquest and domination.\n\nStarting in the 1870s, thousands of African sculptures arrived in Europe in the aftermath of colonial conquest and exploratory expeditions. They were placed on view in museums such as the Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro, founded in 1878 in Paris, and its counterparts in other European cities. At the time, these objects were treated as artifacts of colonized cultures rather than as artworks and were very cheap, often sold in flea markets and pawnshops.\n\nThe different histories of museums inEurope and the United States affected the collecting and display of African art in both places. European museums typically were founded as state institutions and thus their collections and displays were shaped by national interests. The appreciation of African objects purely as fine art in Europe was largely limited to private galleries in the early twentieth century. In Paris, dealers such Paul Guillaume, Charles Ratton and Louis Carre played a role in the formation of major private collections of African art. The latter half of the twentieth century saw the opening of the first European art museums devoted to collecting and displaying African art, including the Musee Barbier-Mueller in Geneva (1977), the Musee Dapper in Paris (1986), but many if not most general national art museums by then had collections.\n\nIn 1897, King Leopold II took advantage of the Brussels International Exhibition in Tervuren to promote his holdings of the Congo. The 1897 International Exhibition piqued scientific interest in the people and animals of Central Africa, thus King Leopold II decided to build on his promotion of Congo. The Royal Museum of Central Africa was established in 1898 as a permanent museum and scientific institution responsible for mounting exhibitions for the Belgian public and encouraging the study of Central Africa.\n\nThe Sainsbury African Galleries in the British Museum in London display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. A great addition was material amassed by Sir Henry Wellcome, which was donated by the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum in 1954. \n\nHighlights of the African collection include the Benin and Igbo-Ukwu bronze sculptures, the beautiful Bronze Head of Queen Idia, a magnificent brass head of a Yoruba ruler from Ife, the Apapa Hoard from Lagos, southern Nigeria, a dozen exquisite Afro-Portuguese ivories, Asante goldwork from Ghana including the Bowdich collection, the rare Akan Drum from the same region in West Africa, a series of soapstone figures from the Kissi people in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the Torday collection of Central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry, important material from Ethiopia following the British Expedition to Abyssinia, the unique Luzira Head from Uganda, excavated objects from Great Zimbabwe and satellite towns such as Mutare including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, a rare divining bowl from the Venda peoples and cave paintings and petroglyphs from South Africa.\nThe Benin Bronzes were seized by a British force in the Benin Expedition of 1897 and given to the British Foreign Office. As Paula Girshick Ben-Amos, a professor of anthropology and African Studies at Indiana University, states in The Art of Benin, “art of the Benin Kingdom came to public and scholarly attention in the West in 1897 when members of a British Punitive Expedition brought out thousands of objects as war booty.”2\n\nAround 200 of the bronzes were passed on to the British Museum, while the remainder were divided among a variety of collections, with the majority being purchased by Felix von Luschan on behalf of the \"Königliches Museum für Völkerkunde\" in Berlin (the present-day Ethnological Museum). In 1936, Oba Akenzua II began the movement to return the corpus of objects now known in modern discourse as the 'Benin Bronzes'.\n\nThe Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro was the first anthropological museum in Paris, founded in 1878. It closed in 1935 when the building that housed it, the Trocadéro Palace, was demolished; its descendant is the Musée de l'Homme, housed in the Palais de Chaillot on the same site, and its French collections formed the nucleus of the Musée National des Arts et Traditions Populaires, also in the Palais de Chaillot. Numerous Fauvist and Cubist artists discovered African art at the Trocadéro Museum. Picasso said that this art taught him \"what painting was all about\", seeing it in the museum's African masks, which had been created \"as a kind of mediation between [humanity] and the unknown hostile forces that [surround us]\", and to have been influenced by the masks in the forms of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, which eventually led to Cubism. Most of the African collection has since been transferred to the Musee du Quai Branly.\n\nInitially, all African art objects were viewed as ethnographic specimens. Notably, during the period of 1890 through 1913, all large museums redefined their public image in terms of an educational prerogative. In response to the debate around the use of the terms \"curio\" and \"curiosity\", the League of the Empire in 1904 recommended the \"orderly arrangement and the transformation of mere curios into objects of scientific interest by appropriate classification.\" Likewise, as a means of validating the expansion of ethnographic collections, the rhetoric often employed was one of the necessity of conservation and preservation in the face of the inevitable extinction of the producers of the materials culture in their custody (121).\n\nStewart Culin, curator at the Brooklyn Museum, was the first American curator to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens, which he did in 1923. Culin distinguished his installation from those of contemporaneous ethnological collections at institutions such as the American Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in saying that \"the objects of Negro art which are displayed publicly form part of museum collections of African ethnology and receive no special attention at the hands of ethnologists... In the majority of these collections their artistic significance is obscured by the wealth of material, and lost, not infrequently, in the efforts made for its elucidation.\"\n\"Art/Artifact\", an exhibition organized by Susan Vogel in 1988, presented 160 objects of art and ethnography selected from the Buffalo Museum of Science, the Hampton University Museum (Virginia), and the American Museum of Natural History (New York City). All three are anthropology museums founded in the 1860s with distinguished African collections. The exhibition examined the shifting definitions of art and artifact, and dealt with the question of how we look at objects from traditional African cultures whose classification systems differ from contemporary Western culture.\n\nDuring the early 1900s, the aesthetics of traditional African sculpture became a powerful influence among European artists who formed an avant-garde in the development of modern art, known as the \"Primitivism\" movement. In France, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and their School of Paris friends blended the highly stylized treatment of the human figure in African sculptures with painting styles derived from the post-Impressionist works of Cézanne and Gauguin. The resulting pictorial flatness, vivid color palette, and fragmented Cubist shapes helped to define early modernism. While these artists knew nothing of the original meaning and function of the West and Central African sculptures they encountered, they claimed to instantly recognize the spiritual aspect of the composition and to adapt these qualities to their own efforts to move beyond the naturalism that had defined Western art since the Renaissance.\n\nGerman Expressionist painters such as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner of Die Brücke (The Bridge) group, based in Dresden and Berlin, conflated African aesthetics with the emotional intensity of dissonant color tones and figural distortion, to depict the anxieties of modern life, while Paul Klee of the Blaue Reiter (Blue Rider) in Munich developed transcendent symbolic imagery. The Expressionists' interest in non-Western art intensified after a 1910 Gauguin exhibition in Dresden, while modernist movements in Italy, England, and the United States initially engaged with African art through contacts with School of Paris artists. These avant-garde artists, their dealers, and leading critics of the era were among the first Europeans to collect African sculptures for their aesthetic value.\n\nThe 1913 Armory Show marked a seminal moment for America’s avant-garde. An exposition of about 1,300 works, it introduced the New York art audience to movements like Cubism, Fauvism and Futurism, as well as the work of European artists including Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Marcel Duchamp. The Armory Show and its promotion of Modernism also helped create a taste and a market for African art in New York.\n\nNotably, in 1914 two New York galleries introduced African sculpture to their audiences: Robert J. Coady’s newly opened Washington Square Gallery and Alfred Stieglitz's well-established Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession. Stieglitz’s held an exhibition in 1914 dedicated entirely to African artifacts as works of art.\n\nNew York City progressively positioned itself as a central marketplace for African art. During the years 1915-19, American dealers began promoting African objects as art to a growing group of collectors. Among the dealers, Mexican artist Marius de Zayas (1880–1961) was largely responsible for helping some adventurous modern-art collectors, including Walter and Louise Arensberg, John Quinn, and Agnes and Eugene Meyer, to build their African art collections. During the early 1920s, several American institutions began opening their doors to African art.\n\nIn 1903, Stewart Culin (1858–1929) became the founding curator of the Department of Ethnology at the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, now the Brooklyn Museum. Culin, a self-taught ethnologist, built the foundation of four curatorial collections for the Museum, acquiring objects representing African, Asian, Native American, and Eastern European cultures. Culin was among the first curators to recognize museum installation as an art form. He was also among the first to display ethnological collections as art objects, not as ethnographic specimens. This approach is evidenced in his exhibition \"Primitive Negro Art, Chiefly from the Belgian Congo\". The exhibition opened in April 1923, and displayed African objects he had acquired in Europe from dealers.\n\nAlbert Barnes was one of the first American collectors to selectively acquire an extensive collection of African sculpture purely on aesthetic merits. In 1923, two years before the Barnes Foundation opening in Merion, Pennsylvania, Barnes wrote, \"When the foundation opens, negro art will have a place among the great manifestations of all times.\" Through his active promotion of the foundation's collection of African sculpture and its aesthetic importance, Barnes himself played a critical role in fostering appreciation of African art in the United States in the early twentieth century.\n\nFounded in 1954 by Nelson A. Rockefeller and Rene d'Harnoncourt, the Museum of Primitive Art was the first art museum exclusively devoted to exhibiting and collecting works of art from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas for their aesthetic value rather than as ethnographic documents or colonial trophies. The museum closed in 1974, and its collection, staff and library were transferred to the Metropolitan Museum of Art according to an agreement made between Rockefeller and the Met in 1969. The Museum of Primitive Art was in many ways an outgrowth of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). It was located directly behind MoMA and was also built on Rockefeller-owned property. Rockefeller was MoMA's president and d'Harnoncourt was its director. MoMA's 1935 landmark exhibition African Negro Art was influential in shaping the director of the Museum of Primitive Art. Today, the Museum of Primitive Art collection is housed in the Metropolitan Michael C. Rockefeller Wing.\n\nThe National Museum of African Art in Washington D.C. was founded by Warren M. Robbins in 1964 as a private and relatively small collection. In 1979 the collection, by then about 8,000 objects, was taken over by the Smithsonian Institution and is now housed in a central if underground location on the National Mall.\n\nMany scholars and curators have debated the efficacy of different modes of display of African art in Western museums. Generally, scholars agree that the Western art museum was, and continues to be, incompatible with the contexts from which most traditional African arts emerged. The following quotation from Kathleen Bickford Berzock and Christa Clarke's introduction to their book \"Representing Africa in American Art Museum\" summarizes the reasons for this incompatibility:\n\nPost-1980s curatorial approaches to collecting and displaying historical African art tend towards greater specialization, broadening definitions, and a desire for contextualization.\n\nCuratorial debate surrounds questions about where boundaries should be drawn between traditional and modern, between African and the African diaspora in the Americas and Europe, and between sub-Saharan and North African art. In certain instances, tradition-based and contemporary works have been exhibited together, a practice that began with the exhibition \"Astonishment and Power: Kingo Minkisi & the Art of Renee Stout\" at the National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C. However, this exhibition was criticized for suggesting a cultural continuity between pre-modern African art and African-American art today while ignoring crucial cultural differences between these two bodies of work.\nThe Benin artist Meschac Gaba's installation \"Museum of Contemporary African Art\" at Tate Modern belies the fact that there is no such thing as a museum of contemporary African art.\n\n"}

The series' protagonist, Bert, is Kamagurka's most recognizable character.\n\nBert is a middle-aged bespectacled man with a long nose who always wears a sweater and long trousers.

{"id": "341879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341879", "title": "Biggles", "text": "Biggles\n\nJames Bigglesworth, nicknamed \"Biggles\", is a fictional pilot and adventurer, the title character and hero of the \"Biggles\" series of adventure books, written for young readers by W. E. Johns (1893–1968). Biggles made his first appearance in the story \"The White Fokker\", published in the first issue of \"Popular Flying\" magazine and again as part of the first collection of Biggles stories, \"The Camels Are Coming\" (both 1932). Johns continued to write \"Biggles books\" until his death in 1968, the series eventually spanning nearly a hundred volumes – including novels and short story collections – most of the latter with a common setting and time.\n\nBiggles first appears as a teenaged \"scout\" (fighter) pilot in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) during the First World War. He has joined the RFC in 1916 at the age of 17, having conveniently \"lost\" his birth certificate. Biggles represents a particularly \"British\" hero, combining professionalism with a gentlemanly air. Under the stress of combat he develops from a slightly hysterical youth prone to practical jokes to a calm, confident, competent leader. He is occasionally given \"special\" (secret) missions by the shadowy figure of Colonel (initially Major) Raymond (Wing Commander/Air Commodore in later books, reflecting the creation of the Royal Air Force with its own ranks), who is already involved with the intelligence side of operations. Biggles is accompanied by his cousin Algernon ('Algy') Lacey and his mechanic Flight Sergeant Smyth, who are to accompany Biggles on his adventures after the war; added to the team in 1935 is the teenager Ginger Hebblethwaite.\n\nW. E. Johns was himself a First World War pilot, although his own career did not parallel that of Biggles particularly closely. The author's initial war service was as an infantryman, fighting at Gallipoli and on the Macedonian front. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in September 1917, seconded to the Royal Flying Corps and posted back to England for flight training: Johns served as a flying instructor in England until August 1918, when he transferred to the Western Front. On 16 September 1918 his De Havilland DH4 was shot down on a bombing raid. His observer, Lieutenant Amey, was killed (in two of the stories in \"Biggles Learns to Fly\" observers flying with Biggles are killed or badly wounded) but Johns survived to be taken prisoner of war. Johns remained with the RAF until 1927, latterly as an administrative officer rather than a pilot: his final rank was Flying Officer (equivalent to Lieutenant in the RFC) rather than the \"Captain\" he later claimed as part of his pen name.\n\nWhile the purpose of the Biggles stories was to entertain adolescent boys, in the First World War stories, Johns paid attention to historical detail and helped recreate the primitive days of early air combat, when pilots often died in their first combat and before devices such as respirators and parachutes had become practical. Various models on which the Biggles character might have been based have been suggested, including rugby player and WWI flying ace Cyril Lowe, fighter pilot Albert Ball and air commodore Arthur Bigsworth. Johns stated that the character was a composite of many individuals in the RFC (including himself).\n\nThe bulk of the Biggles books are set after the First World War, and after Johns' flying career was over. Biggles has an unusually lengthy career, flying a number of aircraft representative of the history of British military aviation, from Sopwith Camels during the First World War, Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires in the Second World War, right up to the Hawker Hunter jet fighter in a postwar adventure \"Biggles in the Terai\". In these later books geographic and historical accuracy is rather less evident and the sometimes rather grim detail of the first stories is moderated, in deference to the increasing popularity of the Biggles books with a younger audience than the older adolescents at which they were initially targeted. The books were popular and were eventually translated into Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Flemish, German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish.\n\nAccording to stories in \"The Boy Biggles\" and \"Biggles Goes to School\", James Bigglesworth was born in India in May 1899, the son of an administrator in the Indian Civil Service and his wife (née Lacey). James was the younger of two sons, Charles being the elder by five years. The young James had little contact with European culture and commenced a lifelong affection for India, befriending the local Indian boys, exploring the countryside and learning to speak fluent Hindi. He retained a lifetime gift for languages and as an adult spoke French and German fluently, with a \"fair command\" of various other languages. He spent holidays in England, under the custody of \"Dickpa\", an eccentric uncle and inventor who lived in rural Norfolk. When Biggles, now an adult, visits Dickpa, his father's brother, again, an adventure begins that takes both men to Brazil. Biggles then attended Malton Hall School in Hertbury, England. His first encounter with an aircraft was with a Blériot that landed on the school cricket ground.\n\nBiggles left school and initially joined the army as a subaltern in the Rifle Regiment in 1916. He transferred to the RFC and learned to fly in the summer of 1916, at No. 17 Flying Training School, which was at Settling, Norfolk, flying solo after two hours of instruction. He then attended No. 4 'School of Fighting' in Frensham, Lincolnshire.\n\nPosted to France with under 15 hours, dual and solo, he first flew in combat in September 1916 with 169 Squadron, RFC, (commanded by Major Paynter). His observer was another youth named Mark Way, a New Zealander. Biggles began flying the F.E.2b \"pusher\" and later the Bristol F2B. In late summer 1917, he was transferred to 266 Squadron RFC, commanded by a Dubliner, Major Mullen. With 266 Squadron, Biggles flew the Sopwith Pup and the famed Sopwith Camel, developing a friendly rivalry with 'Wilks' (Captain Wilkinson) and the S.E.5s of 287 squadron and forming a close friendship with his young cousin Algy (the Hon. Algernon Montgomery Lacey). A study of the short stories featuring his First World War exploits, suggests that he claimed at least 32 kills and was shot down or crash-landed eight times. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Military Cross and bar.\n\nAfter the Great War, Biggles' adventures as a freelance charter pilot, took him around the world in an unidentified amphibian named the \"Vandal\" (often illustrated on covers, anachronistically, as either a Supermarine Walrus or Supermarine Sea Otter). The nearest \"real\" aircraft that fits W. E. Johns description of the \"Vandal\", is a Vickers Viking Mk 4. His team grows when he and Algy meet young Ginger Hebblethwaite in \"The Black Peril\", while foiling a possible German plot against Britain. Post-Second World War editions of the book change this to a Russian plot. Ginger brings the energy and daring of youth to these and many of their later adventures. Between the wars Biggles and his friends mix their own escapades with ventures on behalf of British Secret Service.\n\nBiggles returned to service in the Second World War, initially with a Supermarine S6B type machine in the Baltic Sea and then to defy the Nazis and their allies in Norway. He then took up his post as Commanding Officer of 666 Squadron, RAF, a Special Duties squadron that fought in the Battle of Britain before being sent around the world on specific assignments. Biggles, Algy, Smyth and Hebblethwaite are joined by a new companion, the monocle-wearing Lord Bertram 'Bertie' Lissie. The changed venue forced Johns to update his material with references to new flying slang and aeroplanes, unsuccessfully at first but later with more realism. Biggles' new squadron includes a diverse cast, including the American 'Tex' O'Hara (from Texas), the Welshman 'Taffy' Hughes, the Cockney 'Tug' Carrington, the Oxford graduate Henry Harcourt and 'Ferocity' Ferris from the streets of Liverpool.\n\nAfter the Second World War Johns reinvents Biggles' career yet again, with his former boss the Air Commodore Raymond hiring him as a \"flying detective\" for Scotland Yard. Biggles returns to his rooms in Mount Street, Mayfair and assumes a role as head of the new Special Air Police division with Algy, Ginger and Bertie making up the flying squad. The group takes on criminals who have taken to the air, both at home in Britain and around the globe, as well as battling opponents behind the Iron Curtain. The team fly a wide variety of machines, with Auster and Percival types doing much of the work.\n\nJohns continued writing Biggles short stories and novels up until his death in 1968; in all, nearly 100 Biggles books were published.\n\nA final unfinished novel \"Biggles Does Some Homework\" shows Biggles at last preparing to retire and meeting his mixed-race replacement; Johns died while writing this novel. The 12 completed chapters were issued privately in 1997.\n\nThe Honourable Algernon Montgomery Lacey or “Algy” is a cousin, who is posted to Biggles' flight in 266 Squadron by the influence of his aunt. Despite initial misgivings, the two soon become very close friends and eventually Algy adopts the role of Biggles' second in command. In the books set in the 1930s, Algy, Ginger and Smyth become Biggles' regular companions.\nAlgy starts off in the books as an irresponsible youngster but later on as he ages he becomes more sarcastic and pessimistic.\n\nGinger (his real forename is never revealed) first appears in \"The Black Peril\" (1935) as a teenage runaway found hiding in a railway shed. Ginger left his father, a mineworker in Smettleworth, after an argument about Ginger's determination to become a pilot. When he first meets Biggles, he tells him he is on his way to London to join the RAF. Biggles immediately calls him Ginger because of his red hair. He proves his worth by rescuing Biggles from some enemy agents. He becomes one of the regular team and is often Biggles's chosen companion. He is a talented mechanic and his speech is peppered with youthful slang and Americanisms, learned from the cinema.\n\nFlight Sergeant Smyth is Biggles' trusty mechanic and logistic organiser since they first worked together in 266 Squadron during the First World War. Smyth, aside from being a mechanic in both world wars in Biggles's squadron, also joins them on some journeys to act as mechanic, like \"Cruise of the Condor\" and \"Goes to War\".\n\nFirst appearing in \"Spitfire Parade\" (1941), Lord Bertie is a pilot in 666 Squadron. An eccentric former racing driver, who flies with a hunting horn and a monocle, Bertie joins Biggles in the Air Police in most of the post-war stories. He is a brave and talented fighter, an expert shot and he has a lot of handy knowledge on a range of unusual subjects.\n\nA counterpoint to Lord Bertie, Tug is a boxer from the slums of London. His parents being killed in the war, Tug is out for revenge and can be a very risky person to have around. He scorns alcohol, much to the amusement of his fellow squadron members. In return for Biggles setting him up for a job as a London cabby, he occasionally helps Biggles and his gang on their missions after the Second World War.\n\nBiggles' greatest opponent is the German intelligence officer Erich von Stalhein, a member of an old Prussian family of soldiers. They first meet in \"Biggles Flies East\", in which Biggles is a spy in the Middle East during the First World War, having some narrow escapes. Stalhein returns as an adversary in numerous other adventures: in \"Biggles & Co.\" he is the leader of a group of smugglers based in a medieval castle somewhere in Germany. As the Cold War begins, Stalhein enters the services of the Communist bloc, until his new masters imprison him on the island of Sakhalin, from where Biggles helps him to escape in \"Biggles Buries a Hatchet\". Stalhein then settles in London and he and Biggles remain in touch. It is from Stalhein that Biggles learns that Janis (see \"Female characters\" below) survived the Second World War and was imprisoned in Czechoslovakia, from where Biggles rescues her and goes on to support her in England.\n\nFirst appears as a major (later colonel) in the British Intelligence service during the First World War, in which capacity he organises secret (\"special\") missions in which Biggles takes part. In later books he reappeared as an air commodore.\n\nIn the Biggles stories, female characters appear infrequently. Despite brief affairs, Biggles and his chums remain steadfastly single. Biggles suffers a disappointment in the First World War, when he falls in love with German spy Marie Janis in the short story \"Affaire de Coeur\" set in 1918. Rather than being considered asexual or a repressed homosexual, Biggles' relationship with Janis suggests he is a romantic hero, \"tragically loyal to the only woman he ever really loved\".\n\nIn \"Biggles & Co.\" Stella Carstairs, the daughter of the man Biggles helps, turns up. A pilot herself, she is concerned for Biggles's safety and tells him more than once not to take on her father's request. \n\nIn \"Biggles Flies Again\" (1934), Algy becomes close to Consuelo, the daughter of the President of Bolivia but is dissuaded from continuing the relationship by Biggles, \"...unless you intend marrying her\". In \"Biggles Fails to Return\" (1943), Ginger falls in love with the sister of the French pilot who has flown Biggles into France on a secret mission and at the end of the story Ginger gets to spend several weeks in her company while awaiting transport back to England. The young Ginger is also smitten by the beautiful Polynesian girl Full Moon, in \"Biggles in the South Seas\" (1940).\n\nThere is a discussion of the issue of Biggles, sex and alcohol in \"By Jove, Biggles: The Life of Captain W. E. Johns\" (1981) by Peter Berresford Ellis and Piers Williams.\n\nIn the 1950s, a popular Australian radio version of Biggles, \"The Air Adventures of Biggles\", was made under licence. Johns did not write the scripts and apparently ended the contract after receiving complaints from young readers that the storyline had made Biggles \"go soft\" by taking up a blonde female lover.\n\nAnother female character appears in the form of Worrals (Flight Officer Joan Worralson), eponymous heroine of a related series of books featuring this resourceful and \"plucky\" member of the WAAF. A further Johns creation, the commando Captain Lorrington \"Gimlet\" King, also features in a series of books that intersect with Biggles at times.\n\nThe settings of the Biggles books are spread over more than 50 years; this produces a number of credibility difficulties, especially for older readers.\n\nThough Biggles and his friends age in the books, they do so much more slowly (and inconsistently) than is historically credible. For instance Biggles (with some of his First World War \"chums\") who by now should be well into their forties, are still relatively junior squadron officers flying Spitfires during the Battle of Britain. In the stories set after the end of the Second World War Biggles and Algy, in particular, are, by the rules of arithmetic, passing into their fifties and early sixties, while retaining levels of activity and lifestyle more typical of people at least thirty years younger.\n\nEven within a group of stories set in the same time frame there are some chronological inconsistencies:\n\nIt is doubtful whether a careful rearrangement of the various First World War stories could result in a coherent sequence.\n\nThe author succeeds reasonably well in chronicling developments in aviation technology but social and cultural changes are much more difficult. The cultural and social world of Biggles (whether in the 1930s or some earlier period) does not persist completely unchanged through the whole series – for instance, in an early book, the evidence points to an English nobleman as the perpetrator but Biggles dismisses this out of hand as the gentry would never commit a crime; in a later novel, one of the gentry is the villain. Nonetheless, the social context of the books, viewed in chronological order, does become increasingly old-fashioned, even anachronistic, especially in those works set after the Second World War.\n\nSince the Biggles books were first published, attitudes to race and ethnicity have changed. During the 1960s and 1970s a perception of Biggles as unacceptably racially prejudiced, especially considered as children's literature, drove Biggles from many public and school libraries. \n\nBiggles was brought up in India, speaks fluent Hindi and has a number of Indian friends and colleagues. In \"Biggles Goes to School\", on one occasion when told to write lines in Latin, he remarks that he would rather do so in Hindi. On another occasion the adult Biggles asserts to Air Commodore Raymond that \"while men are decent to me I try to be decent to them, regardless of race, colour, politics, creed or anything else\". While individually developed non-white characters are rather infrequent, when they do occur, they are usually \"positive\", from the Oxford-educated \"Chinaman\", Li Chi, in \"Biggles Flies Again\" and \"Biggles Delivers the Goods\" and the perky Polynesian girl, Full Moon, in \"Biggles in the South Seas\", to Alexander MacKay, a part \"Red Indian\" nicknamed \"Minnie\" who joins \"the chums\" as a valued colleague and is even set to inherit Biggles' job in \"Biggles Does Some Homework\". It has been pointed out that the positive characteristics of these characters tend to be such features as relatively light complexions, Western education and general usefulness to the white hero and his friends and allies.\n\nOn the other hand, when Johns wishes to present an unpleasant \"foreigner\" he will quite often drop a gratuitous and offensive hint that the person involved is of mixed race. Non-whites taken \"en masse\" also tend to be systematically demonised. With the evil \"Chungs\" of \"Biggles Hits the Trail\" and the sub-human Aboriginals of \"Biggles in Australia\", in particular, Johns succumbs to the tendency, typical of his time, to apply unpleasant stereotyping to non-white opponents of his hero. \"No Rest for Biggles\", set in Liberia, where he encounters descendants of Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henri Cristophe plotting to set up a black empire, is another novel which is overtly racist. In \"Biggles in Borneo\", Dayak headhunters are stereotyped as barely human \"savages\", even though they are Biggles' allies against the Japanese. The racism in these books (and others in the \"Biggles\" canon) is typical of a genre of fiction for young people that was once common.\n\n\"Biggles Delivers the Goods\" (published just three years after \"Biggles in Borneo\") repeats the earlier work's plot so closely that the later novel is clearly a revision. In both books, Biggles establishes a secret airfield behind Japanese lines, which is discovered and attacked by the Japanese before he can achieve his objectives. Algy is captured by the Japanese and threatened with execution by a brutal Japanese commandant; rubber (as an important strategic material) figures largely. All ends well in both novels, as a massive air attack relieves the airfield's brave defenders and defeats the Japanese. The protagonists are also closely paralleled in both novels, although in \"Biggles Delivers the Goods\" Li Chi (originally from a short story in \"Biggles Flies Again\") reappears to take the place of a white character from the earlier version; the headhunters, while still milked for \"exotic colour\", are much more sympathetically treated.\n\nThe early Biggles stories and novels, especially those set in First World War, were apparently written mainly for older adolescents. Death is treated rather frequently and sometimes in quite a grim fashion. Other \"adult themes\" are also touched on: more than once Biggles sets out on a mission in a \"red mist\", inspired by the death of a comrade. The emotional strain of combat is also realistically described, as Biggles becomes a \"highly-strung\" fidgeting pale youth, lacking his usual sense of humour. In these stories, in particular, alcohol is mentioned occasionally and cigarettes are much in evidence. The early First World War books were reprinted in the 1950s, when the Biggles books had acquired a younger readership and were bowdlerised. In the short story \"The Balloonatics\", as republished in \"Biggles of the Special Air Police\", the prize for capturing a German observation balloon was altered from a case of Scotch whisky to a case of lemonade. The reprint also removes all references to drinking and swearing. The books contain no explicit sexual content and the traditional values of bravery, honesty and fair play are stressed. Romantic stories, which would have bored his younger readers and embarrassed the older ones, are on the whole avoided, with the odd exception, such as in \"Biggles Looks Back\", where he and Stalhein rescue Marie Janis (with whom Biggles was briefly in love in an earlier story) from her prison in Bohemia.\n\n\n\nJohns died while still writing \"Biggles Does Some Homework\". Although never completed, it was released as a strictly limited edition of 300 copies in paperback. A further limited print run of 300 hardback copies has been printed in 2007 by Norman Wright publishing.\n\nBiggles appeared in a TV series based on the books with Neville Whiting playing the title role. There were 44 B&W untitled episodes of 30 minutes, which were made by Granada and ran from 1 April till 9 September 1960. Biggles was a Detective Air Inspector attached to Scotland Yard. Helping him was Ginger (John Leyton) and Bertie (David Drummond) and they fought against villains like von Stalhein (Carl Duering).\n\nHe was also featured in the 1986 feature film \"Biggles\", directed by John Hough with Neil Dickson in the title role. The film attempted to add appeal to the character by adding a science fiction element but it was a commercial and critical failure. Dickson reprised the character in all but name in the Pet Shop Boys' feature film, \"It Couldn't Happen Here\".\n\nIn 1986, a Biggles video game was released as a tie-in to movie \"Biggles: Adventures in Time\" by Mirrorsoft for the platforms Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. It included levels based in 1917 and other levels set in modern-day London.\n\nThere have been many different versions of Biggles comics published in different countries in Europe, including Great Britain, Belgium, France and Sweden.\n\nThe first British annual appeared in 1980.\nSome albums were released in 1990 featuring the Biggles team. The titles are separate from the books though they cover the same war or after war investigation operations of Biggles.\n\nIn India, Euro Books published 14 titles of the Biggles Series along with compilations of the same in 2007.\n\nBiggles, or members of his team, have appeared in the following Gimlet books\nAir Commodore Raymond also appeared in W E Johns' \"Steeley Books\".\n\nThe books are collectors' items and lesser known titles, especially those never released in paperback, are rare. A copy of \"Biggles and the Deep Blue Sea\" fetched $1,000 on eBay. In 2013, most Biggles books were out of print but a core of popular titles have been reprinted from time to time in various editions. Red Fox (a Random House imprint) reprinted a selection of the \"pre-1945\" titles, with footnotes added to explain slang and military terms used by Johns; fifteen or sixteen of these seem to have been in print in 2013. Collectors interested in acquiring readable copies of the texts (as opposed to mint copies of first editions) have a fair choice of second-hand copies at reasonable prices. \n\n\"Biggles – The Authorised Biography\" by John Pearson, published in 1978, added new and embellished elements to the character's history, including the ageing Biggles' (apparent) suicide in a vintage Spitfire A number of Biggles characters appear in Kim Newman's alternate history novel \"The Bloody Red Baron\". In the \"Red Dwarf\" Series III episode \"Marooned\", Dave Lister burns Arnold Rimmer's copy of \"Biggles Learns to Fly\" to stay warm, while stranded on a hostile moon. Later in the Series X opener \"Trojan\", Rimmer recounts how his brother Howard once painted his rear with orange glow paint, allowing him to read \"Biggles Flies West\" for three nights without needing a torch.\n\nIn \"The Thin Blue Line\" series I episode \"The Queen's Birthday Present\", it is revealed that Inspector Fowler (Rowan Atkinson) is an avid reader of Biggles. Fowler is shocked, when constable Habib (Mina Anwar) suggests that Biggles and Ginger are lovers, something she argues is also the case for Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Upset, Fowler argues that sex has no part in these stories, hetero or otherwise; \"the point of Biggles and of Sherlock Holmes is to solve crimes and kill Germans. And by heaven, that should be enough for any man\". \n\nThe lyrics of the Jethro Tull song, \"Thick As a Brick\", has a line that mentions Biggles (\"So, where the hell was Biggles when you needed him last Saturday?\"). Biggles is mentioned several times in the elaborate album cover, which is a parody of a local British newspaper, most significantly in a story entitled \"Do Not See Me Rabbit\".\n\nBiggles was parodied in a series of skits on the 1970s British comedy television show, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", including one titled \"Biggles Dictates a Letter\". In the sketch, Biggles (Graham Chapman) behaves in a naive and overreactive manner about the sexual orientation of his comrades, shooting Algy in the process.\n\nOther Monty Python treatments of Biggles include:\n\n\"Biggles Flies A Fokker Home\" is a 2011 play written by former cricketer James Graham-Brown under the pen name, Dougie Blaxland. Blogger Reed dé Buch has written a series of short Biggles spoofs, set in the Iraq War called \"Biggles Over Baghdad\", with titles such as \"Biggles and the Weapons of Mass Destruction\" and \"Biggles and the Undersand Railway\".\n\n\"Jiggles and the Test Pilot\", \"Jiggles and the Archaeologists\" and \"Jiggles and the Flying Boats\" are erotic adventures, available as ebooks, pastiching the Biggles books. Veronica Jiggleswick runs Jiggleswick Air with her old school chum Ally, and their mechanic Ginge. Set in the late thirties, their adventures see them pitted against Nazis and common criminals, enjoying lots of sex along the way.\n\n"}
{"id": "39364726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39364726", "title": "Birdman (film)", "text": "Birdman (film)\n\nBirdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance), commonly known simply as Birdman, is a 2014 American black comedy film directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu. It was written by Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris Jr., and Armando Bo. The film stars Michael Keaton with a supporting cast of Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts. The story follows Riggan Thomson (Keaton), a faded Hollywood actor best known for playing the superhero \"Birdman\", as he struggles to mount a Broadway adaptation of a short story by Raymond Carver.\n\nThe film covers the period of previews leading to the play's opening, and with a brief exception appears as if filmed in a single shot, an idea Iñárritu had from the film's conception. Emmanuel Lubezki, who won the Academy Award for his cinematography in \"Birdman\", believed that the recording time necessary for the long take approach taken in \"Birdman\" could not have been made with older technology. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, New Regency Pictures and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival.\n\n\"Birdman\" had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14, grossing more than $103 million worldwide. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography from a total of nine nominations, tying it with \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" for the most nominated and awarded film at the Academy's 87th annual awards ceremony with four wins per film. It also won Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Keaton and Best Screenplay at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards.\n\nRiggan Thomson is a faded American actor who is famous for playing the superhero Birdman in a film trilogy 20 years ago. He is tormented by the mocking and critical internal voice of Birdman and frequently visualises himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis. Riggan is trying to gain recognition as a serious actor for writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.\"\n\nJake, Riggan's best friend and lawyer, is producing the play which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura and Broadway débutante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict whom he is trying to reconnect with, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hapless co-star Ralph, which Riggan tells Jake he caused. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile method actor Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water, attempts to have real sex with Lesley during a sex scene and claims that the prop gun does not look real which is hindering his performance. Riggan clashes continually with Mike and is incensed at influential theater critic Tabitha Dickinson's praise for Mike's performance, but Jake persuades him to continue with the play. Riggan catches Sam using marijuana and berates her; she tells him he is expendable and that his play is a vanity project.\n\nDuring the final preview, Riggan accidentally locks himself outside with his robe stuck in the fire escape door. He is forced to walk through Times Square in his underwear and enter through the audience to do the final scene. A concerned Sam is waiting in his dressing room after the show. She thinks the performance was very weird but sort of cool. She shows him that the Times Square footage is going viral and explains how this actually helps him.\n\nRiggan goes to a bar for a drink and approaches Tabitha, accusing her of not understanding theater and just crudely labeling things. She tells him that she hates ignorant Hollywood celebrities who pretend to be serious actors and promises to \"kill\" his play with a deprecating review without even having seen it. On the way back, Riggan buys a pint of whiskey, drinks it and passes out on a stoop. The next day, walking to the theater with a severe hangover, he has a conversation with the now visible Birdman, who tries to convince him to quit the play and make a fourth Birdman film. Riggan visualises himself flying through the streets of Manhattan before arriving at the theater.\n\nOn the opening night the play is going very well. In his dressing room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife Sylvia that several years ago he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about his inner Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia wishes him luck and leaves the room, Riggan picks up a real gun, rather than a prop, for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on-stage. The play receives a standing ovation as Tabitha rushes out to file copy.\n\nThe next day, Riggan wakes up in a hospital with his face covered in a mask of bandages where his nose has been surgically reconstructed after he blew it off during the botched suicide. Sylvia is worried about him but Jake cannot contain his excitement that the play will run forever after Tabitha's rave-review which called the suicide attempt \"super-realism\" and just what American theater needed. Sam visits with flowers, which he cannot smell, and takes a picture of him to scare the skyrocketing number of followers on the Twitter account she has created for him. While she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and obscenely says goodbye to Birdman, whom he sees sitting on the toilet. Fascinated by some birds flying outside his room, he opens the window and climbs out onto the ledge. When Sam returns, Riggan is nowhere to be seen. She frantically scans the ground below the open window before slowly looking up into the sky, smiling, and laughing.\n\n\"Birdman\" director Alejandro G. Iñárritu originally conceived the film as a comedy filmed in a single shot set in a theatre. The original choice behind the film's genre, which was subsequently re-adapted to concentrate on Riggan's final emotional tail spin, came from the director wanting to see a change in his approach. All his previous films were dramas, and after directing \"Biutiful\", he did not want to approach his new film in the same tragic manner again. The decision to make the film appear as a single shot came from his realization that \"we live our lives with no editing.\" By presenting the film as a continuous shot he could \"submerge the protagonist in an 'inescapable reality' and take the audience with him\". Iñárritu shared his idea with the Argentine screenwriters/cousins Nicolás Giacobone and Armando Bo, as well as playwright Alexander Dinelaris Jr., who had all worked with him on his previous film. Their first reaction was to tell him the continuous-shot idea could not work. According to Dinelaris and Giacobone, \"huge\" and \"important\" people told him to not even try the project for the same reason. Iñárritu himself described the technique as \"almost suicidal\", worrying that it would be distracting instead of immersive. Dinelaris later said that had they truly paused and considered the idea, they might have talked Iñárritu out of it.\n\nThe personal and vocational experiences of the four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film \"were really more like play scenes\". Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of \"Birdman\"s themes. \"What this film talks about, I have been through,\" Iñárritu recalled. \"I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through the last years of my life.\" Dinelaris described this aspect as \"a laughing look at oneself\", but said it had to be done in a comedic way otherwise \"it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject\". Themes from Raymond Carver's short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's. Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was \"terrifying\" because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.\n\nWhile some aspects of the film the first frame with Riggan, for instance went unchanged from \"Birdman's\" conception to release, others went through several iterations. One of these was the sequence in which alter ego Birdman takes complete control over Riggan's thoughts. The writers knew it would occur at Riggan's lowest point, so at one stage planned for it to happen after Riggan hears the initial negative press coverage and destroys his dressing room. In another discarded version, Riggan tries to drown himself in Central Park and flies out to save himself.\n\nThe film's ending also changed, the final version being written halfway through filming. The original intended to depict Johnny Depp in Riggan's dressing room with a \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" poster in the back. Iñárritu grew to strongly dislike this ending, calling it \"so embarrassing\", and rewrote it with Dinelaris and Giacobone after a new ending came to him in a dream. Iñárritu was reluctant to describe the original ending but it was leaked by Dinelaris. He said the original ending was set in the theatre instead of the hospital, and involved Depp putting on Riggan Thomson's wig, and in Jack Sparrow's voice \"...the poster asks Depp, 'What the fuck are we doing here, mate?' and it was going to be the satire of the endless loop of that.\" The director and co-authors ruled out the satirical ending, and favored the new, more ambiguous, ending.\n\nThe project of co-writing was expedited by the collaboration between the four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in \"Birdman\" came from Skype sessions at two in the morning where he and Giacobone were \"cracking each other up\". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said \"We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting\". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be \"very, very sure about what was on the page.\" As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: \"You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. \"Birdman\" looks like a good idea now, but [at the time of production] we did not know how we would land.\"\n\nIñárritu cast several of the leading roles before the film was financed. Among these was the lead role. Early in script development, Iñárritu did not have Keaton in mind, but he had changed his mind by the end: \"When I finished the script, I knew that Michael was not the choice or option, he was the guy\". Iñárritu cast Keaton for his depth in a variety of acting styles: he could handle the demands of the stage, up-close work, and comedy and empathy \"with a profound depth to both.\"\n\nKeaton knew about \"Birdman\" before Iñárritu contacted him. He was in the middle of production of another project when he learned that Iñárritu was making another film. Keaton, a fan of his work, flew home to find out more. Iñárritu sent him the script and they discussed it over dinner. The first thing Keaton asked the director was whether he was making fun of him (regarding his role in Tim Burton's \"Batman\" films), but after Iñárritu explained the role, its technicalities and the film's production, Keaton agreed to play Riggan.\n\nIñárritu called his decision behind casting Galifianakis as Jake \"a bet\". Galifianakis met the director's criteria of being lovable and funny, but Iñárritu also considered him sensitive, which scored him the role. Emma Stone already knew she wanted to work with Iñárritu before she was offered the role of Sam. The script that Iñárritu gave her and the rest of the cast came with the photo \"Man on Wire\", which featured Philippe Petit crossing the Twin Towers on a tightrope. Iñárritu told the cast, \"We are doing that\".\n\nOnce these actors were committed, Iñárritu sought funding. He first invited Fox Searchlight Pictures to finance the project, but they turned his offer down because they felt his asking budget was too high. At one stage Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures wanted to be involved in the project, but decided against it because, unlike her other films, she had not been involved since the beginning. Iñárritu approached Brad Weston, president of New Regency, who accepted the offer. When executive Claudia Lewis of Searchlight heard about the deal, she reconsidered and asked to be included in the deal. Searchlight and New Regency had previously worked together to finance \"12 Years a Slave\", and they decided to join together for \"Birdman\", financing a budget of $16.5 million.\n\nWeston and Lewis developed a close relationship with Iñárritu, editing the script with him and switching some of the actors. When they joined production, Josh Brolin was set to play the role of Mike Shiner, but the financiers decided to switch him for Norton because of scheduling conflicts.\n\nHe said Norton's experience as a theatre actor combined with his self-confidence meant that \"in a way there was some kind of mental reality to Edward\", but Norton believes he was the one who convinced Iñárritu to take him on. Norton was a fan of the director's work and impressed with his ability to push outside film-making boundaries. Norton heard about Iñárritu's project from a friend. Once he got the script, he read it straight through until 3:00 am. Norton said, \"I laughed so hard I woke people up.\" Norton wanted to meet Iñárritu the next day, and once they met, Norton told him he could not cast someone who was the \"embodiment\" of what the script was taking aim at. Instead, the director needed to cast someone \"who has at least a little bit of authentic depth of experience, in this world.\" Iñárritu agreed.\n\nRyan, one of the last actors to be cast, was invited because Iñárritu had seen her in the play \"Detroit\". Lindsay Duncan had vast experience in the theatre world too, and decided to accept the offer to play the critic because of the quality of the script. \"It's delicious because of the writing.\" But like Shiner's character, Iñárritu found casting Laura difficult. Riseborough met him on a street corner for a cup of tea, and recalling the event, said \"I told him that I would crawl across hot coals to work with him\". Iñárritu described Laura as \"a very wacky, quirky role\", but said \"when [Andrea Riseborough] did it I knew that it was her, because she did it right in the tone, and she understood who she was – she was not judging\".\n\nOnce the writing was finished, Iñárritu contacted friend and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki to discuss his idea for the film. After reading the script, Lubezki was worried that Iñárritu would offer him the job since \"[Birdman] had all of the elements of a movie that I did not want to do at all\" comedy, studio work and long takes but changed his mind after further discussion with the director. The pair had worked together on commercials and a short film in the anthology \"To Each His Own Cinema\", but not on any feature films. Lubezki wanted to be sure that this was a decision Rodrigo Prieto, cinematographer of all four of Iñárritu's feature films, was comfortable with, but after receiving his blessing, the two headed into pre-production.\n\nLubezki was concerned that no film had been shot in the way Iñárritu envisioned, meaning there would be no reference material to look up. The two decided the only way to learn how to shoot it would be to shoot it themselves, so they hired a warehouse in Sony Studios, Los Angeles, and built a proxy stage. The setup was minimal. Canvas and C-stands were used for walls, while tape and a few pieces of furniture marked out areas. Using a camera and some stand-ins, the duo worked through the movie to see if it was possible. Realizing no theatre could accommodate the intricate camerawork they needed, they hired Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. Still, Iñárritu wanted to shoot at a Broadway theater, but would have to wait until several weeks into rehearsals before securing St. James Theatre. They then spent a few months designing and making \"blueprints\" of the shots and blocking the scenes, using the stand-ins to read and walk through the script. The planning was precise. Iñárritu said \"There was no room to improvise at all. Every movement, every line, every door opening, absolutely everything was rehearsed.\" The actors started rehearsing once this preliminary work was completed: according to Lubezki, they did the scenes with the actors \"once we kind of knew what the rhythm of the scenes were.\" He described the atypical approach \"like an upside down movie where you do post-production before the production\".\n\nEditors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione were involved in the project by this stage. When Iñárritu told Mirrone that he planned for Lubezki to record table readings and the rehearsals, he suggested they edit them immediately to discover what was and was not working early on. The editing also allowed the editors to discuss pacing issues with the director, such as the position of the night-day transitions and other moments of rest in the film. Production designer Kevin Thompson was on hand too, and mapped out the scenes. The camerawork required many elements of the set to be built in a certain way. For example, Riggan's makeup mirror and desk were constructed so that the camera would see his reflection. Thompson also took into consideration the needs of the crew, for instance designing the stairs a little wider for Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff's footsize.\nHe then constructed a template of the set they would build when in New York. The writers were also involved in the rehearsals, fine-tuning the script to \"make sure the film was fluid and never stopped\".\n\nOnce the logistics of the scenes were worked out and they had the timing down, the team headed to Kaufman Studios for more rehearsals, followed by principal photography based exclusively in New York during the spring of 2013. The studios were used to film the backstage areas of the film, including Riggan's dressing room and the theatre corridors. St. James Theatre was used for two weeks; it was the location for the stage scenes. The bar segments were shot in The Rum House on 47th Street, and 43rd Street was used for the action-sequence. The film was unable to be shot chronologically because of scheduling with the theatre. Throughout the locations, including the studio, the scenes were lit with natural light, since Lubezki wanted the movie \"to look as naturalistic as possible.\" The night-time scenes were possible to film in this way due to the brightness of New York. Lubezki found lighting the scenes to be the hardest part of his work on the film. Not only did the lighting need to look realistic, but also had to be designed so that the continuous movements of the camera did not project the crew's shadows onto the actors.\n\nThroughout shooting, Arri Alexa cameras were used; an Alexa M was used for handheld sequences, and an Alexa XT was attached to the Steadicam. Neither used matteboxes, however. Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff explained this decision: \"We didn't want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline. This way we could get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actor's face.\" Lubezki who did all the handheld camerawork had chosen the Alexa M because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors, sometimes filming two inches away from Keaton's face. The camera also allowed recording for such a long period necessary for the long takes of the movie that Lubezki went so far as to say the movie would have been impossible to do years before. The cameras were lensed with Leica Summilux-C or Zeiss Master Primes. Lubezki stated that these gave clean images, saying \"You can have all these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that\". In terms of sizes, they initially trialled a 21mm, but this did not give Iñárritu the \"intimacy\" he wanted. The crew instead went to an 18mm Leica, which was used for the majority of the film. Only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm, but this was rare.\n\nDespite all the preparation, a typical shooting day would begin with rehearsals. These usually lasted most of the morning, after which photography followed. The meticulous timing for the scenes meant that takes were canceled because of the slightest mishaps. Emma Stone, in an interview with Jimmy Fallon, recalled how a six-minute take of the scene where Riggan first meets Mike was ruined after she walked around a corner too quickly. Takes were also repeated if a scene's rhythm did not feel right to Iñárritu, or if he and Lubezki were not satisfied with a shot's framing. As shooting progressed lines of dialog would also be dropped, giving Iñárritu more options during post-production. Because of this, the number of takes for a given scene was high, usually twenty for the shorter scenes, the takes running smoothly around the fifteenth. Chris Haarhoff described it as \"a type of dance where everyone would hopefully try to peak all at the same moment.\" The locations sometimes placed restrictions on the takes too; the live Times Square sequence was shot only twice since they did not want to attract the attention of tourists.\n\nWhenever shooting was taking place there was pressure on everyone involved, but the cast had a positive experience. Norton said that normally in movie production half the people can \"check out\" due to repetitive aspects, but during the shooting of \"Birdman\" \"everybody's on, the whole thing, and you're all on pins and needles because you're all relying on forty other people not to drop the ball.\" Because of this, Stone said the director was able to get the best out of the cast, saying \"[Iñárritu's process] creates this sort of fury in you, and then you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didn't even know you had\". Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere \"felt emblematic of how it feels onstageat least my long-time memories from long ago\". Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as \"wonderful\", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived and then \"the magic happens with you, and then everything leaves you, and everything's silent\". Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved. Norton said \"I've never, ever been on a set where every day ended with an enormous, authentic sort of cheer at having made it. You're waiting for the scream from [Iñárritu] and everybody was genuinely excited.\"\n\nThe film's original music segments are a drum score consisting entirely of solo jazz percussion performances by Antonio Sánchez. The score is offset by a number of well known classical music pieces, including Mahler and Tchaikovsky. Iñárritu did not regard the particular choice of classical pieces as important. Nonetheless, the choice of classical music was strongly oriented to highly melodic scores taken predominantly from the 19th century classical repertoire (Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Ravel). Iñárritu stated that the classical components come from the world of the play, citing the radio in Riggan's room and the show itself as two sources of the music. The classical music segments also included two compositions by American composer John Adams. Several jazz compositions by Victor Hernández Stumpfhauser and Joan Valent counterbalance the original music composition by Sánchez. The drum sections comprise the majority of the score however, and were composed by Sánchez. Iñárritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes, and that \"The drums, for me, was a great way to find the rhythm of the film... In comedy, rhythm is king, and not having the tools of editing to determine time and space, I knew I needed something to help me find the internal rhythm of the film.\"\n\nIñárritu contacted friend and jazz drummer Antonio Sánchez in January 2013, inviting him to compose the score for the film. His reaction to writing a soundtrack using only drums was similar to Lubezki's thoughts of shooting the movie like a single shot: \"It was a scary proposition because I had no point of reference of how to achieve this. There's no other movie I know that has a score like this.\" Sánchez had also not worked on a film before, nevertheless, after receiving the script, he composed \"rhythmic themes\" for each of the characters. Iñárritu was looking for the opposite approach however, preferring spontaneity and improvisation. Sánchez then waited until production moved to New York before composing more, where he visited the set for a couple of days to get a better idea of the film. Following this, a week before principal photography, he and Iñárritu went to a studio to record some demos. During these sessions the director would first talk him through the scene, then while Sánchez was improvising guide him by raising his hand to indicate an event such as a character opening a door or by describing the rhythm with verbal sounds. They recorded around seventy demos, which Iñárritu used to inform the pacing of the scenes on set, and once filming was complete, spliced them into the rough cut. Sánchez summarized the process by saying \"The movie fed on the drums and the drums fed on the imagery.\" The official soundtrack was released as a CD (77 min) in October 2014, and as an LP (69 min) in April 2015.\n\nWhen the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released their longlist for the Academy Award for Best Original Score in December 2014, \"Birdman\" was absent from the list. The previous day, Sánchez received a note from the award committee explaining the decision, quoting rule fifteen of the 87th Academy Award Rules, noting \"the fact that the film also contains over a half an hour of non-original (mostly classical) music cues that are featured very prominently in numerous pivotal moments in the film made it difficult for the committee to accept your submission\". Sánchez launched an appeal, and along with Iñárritu and the executive vice-president of Fox Music, they sent letters to Charles Fox, the chair of the Academy's music branch executive committee, asking that the committee reconsider their decision. One of the points they raised was that the committee incorrectly calculated the ratio of classical to original music, which after being clarified Sánchez thought he was \"on really solid ground\". A response from Fox on December 19 however, explained that a special meeting of the music committee was held, and although its members had \"great respect\" for the score and considered it \"superb\", they thought that the classical music \"was also used as scoring\", \"equally contributes to the effectiveness of the film\", and that the musical identity of the film was created by both the drums and classical music. Ultimately, they did not overturn their decision. Sánchez said that he and Iñárritu were not satisfied with the explanation.\n\n\"Birdman\" was edited by Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, who had both worked with the director before on \"21 Grams\" and \"Babel\". Stitching shots together was, of course, a crucial component of the editing, but Crise and Mirrone already had experience doing this. The director had included takes that were joined together in previous films, but in these if the editors didn't think the stitching worked they had the ability to introduce cuts. Mirrone said that in \"Birdman\" Iñárritu had \"let go of that safety net\". Because of this the editors needed to be involved in the project early on, and during principal photography Crise was on set every day. (Mirrone was busy and unable to be in New York.) Crise was not used to being on set and providing feedback, but said he was happy Iñárritu \"dragged it out\" of him, knowing that they wouldn't have much room to fix scenes later so they needed to get them right. For stitching, aside from the director, Crise also discussed strategies with Lubezki and Thompson, and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors' bodies. The editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts, so without this tool used Sánchez's music instead. The director gave the New York recordings to Crise early on to help with pacing, asking him to cut the music to the film. Still, in terms of the editing workflow, Crise described it as \"pretty traditional\". The editors cut the film together back in Los Angeles. A few weeks after shooting they were quite far along the cut itself, and transitioned into visual-effects mode, where they fine-tuned the shots.\n\nThe visual effects for the film were created by Montreal studio Rodeo FX. They spent four months working on the film, and according to visual effects supervisor Ara Khanikian \"visual effects touched 90% of the frames in the movie\". A lot of the work was subtle. For example, stitching shots together, or creating the background for the windows in the hospital scene. Many shots in the film feature mirrors, and much work was spent removing the reflections of the crew from these. To accomplish this the studio created a 2.5D digital matte painting of the reflected environment. They then rotoscoped out the parts of the mirror not containing the foreground actors and their reflections, and replaced these with the digital environment. Some of the original shots captured smudges and dirt on the mirrors, so the studio developed a way to extract them so they could paste them back into the film. A matte-painting was constructed for the night-day time lapses in the film too, created by matchmoving and reprojecting shots of the buildings it features, captured at different times of the day, together. Rodeo FX also adjusted the pace of scenes. Iñárritu demanded a \"very precise rhythm and flow\" to the film, so the studio had to re-speed much of it with timewarp curves to fit the pacing the director desired.\n\nUnlike some of the smaller adjustments though, the flying sequence required extensive preparation. Iñárritu spent three weeks with Halon Entertainment to previsualize the sequence. In New York, Lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence, using a camera crane on a truck. When these were shot, Lubezki had mounted four GoPro cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him. Later, on a greenstage in Montreal, using a technique he had developed on Gravity, Lubezki lit Keaton with LED panels featuring high-dynamic-range images of the surrounding New York footage. The panels then realistically lit Keaton. Khanikian described the effect of the process, saying \"instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen [we were getting] the proper red bounce from the red bricks and the same color of the sky reflected on Michael's head. It worked so well.\" Rodeo FX then completed the final shots. The sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film. Mirrone commented that before the sequence was finished they \"had only imagined what it was going to feel like\", but once it was completed \"it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away.\"\n\nSound design for the film was handled by Martín Hernández, who has worked on all the director's feature films. The production sound his team was given was \"surprisingly perfect and clean\", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it. The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hernández edited sound though. \"Normally Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds.' The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on \"Birdman\" because here, everything is flowing.\" Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task since the camera was nearly always moving. Hernández also helped to cut Sánchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film. When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order \"to have distance, and closeness and resonance\" the team used thirty two microphones for each take. Hernández described the job as \"crazy\". A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. Iñárritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers. Hernández said he thought, for a film in general, that the narrative created by sound \"provokes more 'explosions'\" than that created by images, and that in \"Birdman\" \"Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film.\"\n\nThe digital intermediate was completed by a team at Technicolor led by Steven Scott. They had previously collaborated with Lubezki on \"Gravity\", but needed to approach \"Birdman\" differently because of the continuous-shot approach. According to Scott, \"we have never done anything like it before.\" The color timing had to be done in such a way that the transitions between color-corrected environments were invisible, in contrast to a usual film where the transitions coincide with visible cuts. To do this, the team inserted their own cuts whenever the camera was stationary, and in the middle of pans and other camera movements. They then devised a way to color correct the stationary cuts and turn the moving cuts into a form of dissolve, allowing them to \"do all these independent, crazy, complicated, color corrections that would flow organically from one to another.\" Inserting the dissolves required rotoscoping methods which the software Scott and his team were using did not have, but an enterprise agreement between Technicolor and the software's developer led to the creation of a tool Scott required. For the color timing itself, one of the priorities of the team was making the faces as dimensional and readable as possible. This required, amongst other things, that faces be highlighted, but the moving camerawork meant that the mattes used in this process had to be animated by hand. Lubezki would provide notes on the areas he wanted tracked, then the team would carry out the animations. Of the whole process, Iñárritu remarked that \"everyone was out of their comfort zone\", while Scott said it was the most challenging DI project of his career.\n\nThe director has emphasized and defended the various ambiguities intentionally included in the film: \"At the ending of the film [it] can be interpreted as many ways as there are seats in the theater.\" Many aspects of film theory were debated concerning the film by critical reviews which included, among other subjects, (a) film genre; (b) intended and unresolved ambiguities of plot; and (c) the complex interaction of Riggan's personal life with his professional life as an actor. A short list of the diverse forms of film genre associated with the film has included it being referred to alternatively as a black-humor film, a mental health film, a realism/surrealism/magical realism film, a dark-humor parody film, a film of psychological realism, a failed domestic reconciliation drama, or a film concerning theatrical realism and naturalism. Inarritu has maintained his penchant, well-known to followers of his previous films, for deliberately including multiple plot lines in this film which are intentionally left unresolved at the ending. Separate reviews in the press have also summarized the film as closely associated with the theme of the final tailspin of a late mid-life crisis in the life of a has-been actor seeking closure and resolution in his public and private life.\n\nThe father-daughter themes in the film, portrayed through the relationship of Riggan and Samantha, were the \"most difficult\" and important parts of the film to depict for co-writers Dinelaris and Giacobone, as they both had similar experiences within their families involving their own relationships with their daughters. When the writers were asked about the meaning of the ambiguous ending which the director was refusing to comment upon, they stated that any comedic ending was completely ruled out. The writers also stated that reflections about the conclusion to the film were not directly concentrated upon Riggan or the character of Birdman as much as upon the lives of the surviving characters portrayed in the film, in particular the portrayal of Riggan's daughter Samantha, rather than upon the character of Riggan himself.\n\nNoting the thematic pull between Riggan's insanity or actual superpowers, Travis LaCouter of \"First Things\" writes that \"the importance of these powers real or imagined is apparent: They are for Riggan the thing beyond the labels, the kernel of his genius and, because he sees drawing upon them as selling out, the source of his great angst.\" LaCouter concludes that \"the quirky profundity of this film is in how it dares the viewer to consider the everyday magic that we tend to ignore, repress, or resent\".\n\nCritics Barbara Schweizerhof and Matthew Pejkovici see the film's central theme as a satirical critique of contemporary theatrical realism, with Pejkovici laudably comparing it to Fellini's film \"8½\" (1963). As Pejkovici states: \"Much like Fellini's 1960[sic] classic \"8½\", Iñárritu's \"Birdman\" is a very intimate film about an artist's malaise, yet is epic, innovative, and ambitious in approach. Iñárritu captures the artist's battle between ambition, admiration and celebrity with stunning scope and skill in the form of a one take format, as his camera sweeps through the backstage corridors, across the stage, out on the busy NYC streets, and back again in breathtaking fashion.\"\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\"s Caryn James compared the story to that of \"Don Quixote\" (who believes himself to be a knight), as the main character believes he is a superhero (the equivalent to a knight in the 21st century).\n\n\"Birdman\" was selected as the opening film of the 71st Venice International Film Festival along with Mohsen Makhmalbaf's new film. A limited release began in four North American theatres on October 17, 2014, followed by a nationwide release in 857 theatres on November 14, 2014.\n\n\"Birdman\" grossed $42.3 million in North America and $60.9 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $103.2 million, against a budget of about $17 million.\n\nThe film earned $424,397 during its limited North America opening in four theatres in New York and Los Angeles on the weekend of October 17, 2014, a per-theater average of $106,099, making it the 18th all-time earner (eighth among live-action movies) and ranking 20. In the second weekend of October 24, 2014, \"Birdman\" expanded to 50 theaters and earned $1.38 million, which translates to a $27,593 per-theater average. The film expanded nationwide to 857 theaters in the weekend of November 14, 2014, grossing $2,471,471 with a per theatre average of $2,884 and ranking 10. In the same weekend, \"Birdman\" grossed $11.6 million.\n\nThe film opened in Mexico on November 13, 2014, grossing $628,915 in its opening weekend, and opened in the United Kingdom on January 2, 2015, grossing $2,337,407 over the weekend. In the United Kingdom, Australia and Italy, the film grossed $7.6 million, $3.97 million, and $1.97 million respectively.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 322 reviews, and an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A thrilling leap forward for director Alejandro González Iñárritu, \"Birdman\" is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.\" On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 88 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A–\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWriting for \"The New Yorker\", Richard Brody called the film \"Godardian\", comparing it to \"Pierrot le Fou\" (1965), \"Every Man for Himself\" (1980), \"Alphaville\" (1965), and \"Germany Year 90 Nine Zero\" (1991), four classic films by French director Jean-Luc Godard. However, he suggested the film fell short of reaching the same cinematic mastery, adding, \"it's not a good idea for a filmmaker to get in the ring with Mr. Godard\". Thematically, he also compared it to \"Opening Night\" (1977) by John Cassavetes. Brody said that the actors played in \"the sort of modern naturalism, without eccentricity of gesture, excess of expression, or heightened and formalistic precision, that is the business-casual of contemporary cinema.\" In his critical comments on the film, he concluded that the film \"trade[d] on facile, casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce\" and \"deliver[ed] a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama\".\n\nIn a review in \"The New Yorker\" separately supplementing the review by Brody, Anthony Lane rejected the film's suggestion that film critics are out to destroy films, explaining, \"Someone could have told Iñárritu that critics, though often mean, are not preemptively so, and that anybody who'd say, as Tabitha does, 'I'm going to destroy your play,' before actually seeing it, would not stay long in the job.\" In \"The New York Times\", Manohla Dargis compared the main character to Icarus, the Greek mythological figure who crashed to his death after flying too close to the sun. She also noted a reference to Susan Sontag's \"Against Interpretation\" in the dressing-room mirror.\n\nRichard Kolker compared the film to both Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rope\" (1948) and Alexander Sokurov's \"Russian Ark\" (2002). Kolker conclude that \"Birdman\" is \"a film about acting, identity, transformation, and the mysterious effects of superheroes, (and) is filmed to create the illusion of being made in one continuous take. As with \"Rope\", the edits are hidden and the result is a rhythmic slide through the life of an actor in search of his self, a search doomed from the start.\"\n\nInternational reception of the film was also at a high level of praise. In Germany, a film aggregate rating at EPD Film gave the film a 3.4 out of 5 rating based on seven critiques. The German critic Barbara Schweizerhof gave the film a 4 out of 5 possible stars complimenting the director's satirical virtuosity in making the film. In her review, Schweizerhof spoke of the film as inviting the viewer to re-watch it \"a second and third time\", and praised the technical achievement of representing a storyline depicting \"the feverish stream of consciousness\" of its main character throughout the film.\n\nThe camerawork, which depicts most of the film as one continuous take, was met with extensive acclaim for its execution and usage. The acting was widely praised, particularly Keaton's, with Peter Debruge of \"Variety\" calling the performance the \"comeback of the century.\" Debruge described the film as \"a self-aware showbiz satire\" and called it \"a triumph on every creative level.\" Robbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" rated the film 5/5 and gave particular praise to the use of long takes by Emmanuel Lubezki, director of photography. Richard Roeper gave the film an \"A\" and wrote that Keaton made a serious case for an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination (which Keaton later achieved).\n\nMargaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from \"At the Movies\" praised the film's writing, direction, performances and cinematography. Stratton also described the implementation of the percussion score as \"really exciting\", while Pomeranz summarised \"it's just really beautifully written and stunningly performed and beautifully made.\" The pair both gave the film five stars, making \"Birdman\" the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2014.\n\nSome critics, however, provided negative reviews. Reviewing it for \"Vanity Fair\", Richard Lawson called the film \"hoary\" and \"deceptively simple\". Scott Tobias, writing for The Dissolve, gave the film 1.5 stars. He commends Lubezki's cinematography as succeeding at \"trapping viewers in a pressure-cooker atmosphere as Riggan and his players struggle to keep it together\", but suggests that Iñárritu is \"incapable of modulation\" and that there exists \"a sourness to \"Birdman\" that Iñárritu can't turn into wit.\"\n\nIn 2015, the film was named as one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by \"The Guardian\".\n\nAt the 87th Academy Awards, \"Birdman\" won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. Michael Keaton was nominated for Best Actor, Edward Norton and Emma Stone were nominated in Best Supporting Acting categories, and it also received nominations for Sound Editing and Sound Mixing.\n\nKeaton received his first Golden Globe Award, winning for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. The film also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay.\n\n\"Birdman\" was listed on many critics' top ten lists.\n\n\n"}

It is situated in the Kalmar Strait, between the mainland province of Småland and the island province of Öland. Administratively, the uninhabited island is part of the municipality of Oskarshamn and covers an area of approximately with a mean height above sea level of . Home to black guillemots and a Swedish National Park since 1926, freedom to roam at Blå Jungfrun is limited with visitors prohibited from staying overnight on the island or making fires.\n\nThe island consists partly of bare rock with the remainder covered in dense hardwood forest. There are several caves and an ancient stone labyrinth from which it is forbidden to remove stones.\n\nGeologically the island is an ancient inselberg rising from the Sub-Cambrian peneplain. After its formation in the Precambrian time Blå Jungfrun was buried in sandstone being shielded for erosion. It was freed from its sandstone cover in geologically recent times.\n\nThe island plays an important role in Swedish folklore, where it is viewed as an evil and magical place. The name Blå Jungfrun was originally used by sailors to avoid provoking the evil spirits who dwelt on the island. According to a widespread belief, related already by Olaus Magnus in 1555, witches meet there each Maundy Thursday. Carl Linnaeus, who visited the island in 1741, was sceptical:\n\"Women and fairy-tales ... generally say that all witches will go here (truly a rather difficult journey) each Maundy Thursday; but those who have visited the place once are not likely to return, and should find out the reason for the fable: If any place in the world looks hideous, this is surely one of the most cruel.\"\n\nThe many water polished stones on the beaches of Blå Jungfrun are illegal to remove from the island because of its national park status. And according to tradition, anyone who steals a stone from the island will suffer from bad luck until it is returned. The town of Oskarshamn yearly receives stones from former Blå Jungfrun visitors, often with an accompanying letter describing misfortunes and disasters which happened to the letter writers after removing them. In May 2004, over 160 such stones were publicly brought back to the island on a ferry from Oskarshamn.\n\nBetween 1904 and 1925 the red granite of Blå Jungfrun was extracted in three quarries on the south of the island. It was exported chiefly to Germany as decorative stone. The destruction led to efforts to protect the island. A donation from the Swedish entrepreneur Torsten Kreuger made it possible to acquire the island and stop the quarrying. The national park was established on February5, 1926 by the Government of Sweden.\n\nIn summer, the island can be visited by tour boats from Oskarshamn or from Byxelkrok. Regular trips began in the 1950s. A park guide on Blå Jungfrun informs the visitors about the national park and its regulations. The visit on the island lasts for about 3,5 hours.\n\n\n"}

It was developed in the 1950s by Investor's Business Daily founder William O'Neil. The method was named the top-performing investment strategy from 1998-2009 by the American Association of Individual Investors. In 2015, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) was launched focusing on the companies listed on the IBD 50, a computer generated list published by Investors Business Daily that highlights stocks based on the CAN SLIM investment criteria.\n\nCAN SLIM is a growth stock investing strategy formulated from a study of stock market winners dating back to 1953 in the book \"How to Make Money in Stocks: A Winning System In Good Times or Bad\". This strategy involves implementation of both technical analysis and fundamental analysis.\n\nThe objective of the strategy is to discover leading stocks before they make major price advances. These pre-advance periods are \"buy points\" for stocks as they emerge from price consolidation areas (or \"bases\"), most often in the form of a \"cup-with-handle\" chart pattern, of at least 7 weeks on weekly price charts.\n\nThe strategy is one that strongly encourages cutting all losses at no more than 7% or 8% below the buy point, with no exceptions, to minimize losses and to preserve gains. It is stated in the book, that buying stocks of solid companies should generally lessen chances of having to cut losses, since a strong company (good current quarterly earnings-per-share growth, annual growth rate, and other strong fundamentals) will usually shoot up—in bull markets—rather than descend. Some investors have criticized the strategy when they didn't use the stop-loss criterion; O'Neil has replied that you have to use the whole strategy and not just the parts you like.\n\nO'Neil has stated that the CANSLIM strategy is not momentum investing, but that the system identifies companies with strong fundamentals—big sales and earnings increases which is a result of unique new products or services—and encourages buying their stock when they emerge from price consolidation periods (or \"bases\") and before they advance dramatically in price.\n\nThe seven parts of the acronym are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31994535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31994535", "title": "Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism", "text": "Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism\n\nA number of authors have carried out comparisons of Nazism and Stalinism, in which they have considered the similarities and differences of the two ideologies and political systems, what relationship existed between the two regimes, and why both of them came to prominence at the same time. During the 20th century, the comparison of Stalinism and Nazism was made on the topics of totalitarianism, ideology, and personality cult. Both regimes were seen in contrast to the liberal West, with an emphasis on the similarities between the two. The American political scientists Zbigniew Brzezinski, Hannah Arendt and Carl Friedrich and historian Robert Conquest were prominent advocates of applying the \"totalitarian\" concept to compare Nazism and Stalinism.\n\nOne of the first scholars to publish a comparative study of Nazi Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union was Hannah Arendt. In her 1951 work, \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\", Arendt puts forward the idea of totalitarianism as a distinct type of political movement and form of government, which “differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship.” Furthermore, Arendt distinguishes between a totalitarian movement (such as a political party with totalitarian aims) and a totalitarian government. Not all totalitarian movements succeed in creating totalitarian governments once they gain power. In Arendt’s view, although many totalitarian movements existed in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, only the governments of Stalin and Hitler succeeded in fully implementing their totalitarian aims. \n\nArendt traced the origin of totalitarian movements to the nineteenth century, focusing especially on antisemitism and imperialism. She emphasized the connection between the rise of European nation-states and the growth of antisemitism, which was due to the fact that the Jews represented an “inter-European, non-national element in a world of growing or existing nations.” Conspiracy theories abounded, and the Jews were accused of being part of various international schemes to ruin European nations. Small antisemitic political parties formed in response to this perceived Jewish threat, and, according to Arendt, these were the first political organizations in Europe that claimed to represent the interests of the whole nation as opposed to the interests of a class or other social group. The later totalitarian movements would copy or inherit this claim to speak for the whole nation, with the implication that any opposition to them constituted treason.\n\nEuropean imperialism of the nineteenth century also paved the way for totalitarianism, by legitimizing the concept of endless expansion. After Europeans had engaged in imperialist expansion on other continents, political movements developed which aimed to copy the methods of imperialism on the European continent itself. Arendt refers specifically to the “pan-movements” of pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism, which promised continental empires to nations that had little hope of overseas expansion. According to Arendt, “Nazism and Bolshevism owe more to Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism (respectively) than to any other ideology or political movement.”\n\nArendt argues that both the Nazi and Bolshevik movements “recruited their members from [a] mass of apparently indifferent people whom all other parties had given up,” and who “had reason to be equally hostile to all parties.” For this reason, totalitarian movements did not need to use debate or persuasion, and did not need to refute the arguments of the other parties. Their target audience did not have to be persuaded to despise the other parties or the democratic system, because it consisted of people who already despised mainstream politics. As a result, totalitarian movements were free to use violence and terror against their opponents without fear that this might alienate their own supporters. Instead of arguing against their opponents, they adopted deterministic views of human behavior and presented opposing ideas as “originating in deep natural, social, or psychological sources beyond the control of the individual and therefore beyond the power of reason.” The Nazis in particular, during the years before their rise to power, engaged in “killing small socialist functionaries or influential members of opposing parties” both as a means to intimidate opponents and as a means of demonstrating to their supporters that they were a party of action, “different from the ‘idle talkers’ of other parties.”\n\nTotalitarian governments make extensive use of propaganda, and are often characterized by having a strong distinction between what they tell their own supporters and the propaganda they produce for others. Arendt distinguishes these two categories as \"indoctrination\" and \"propaganda\". Indoctrination consists of the message that a totalitarian government promotes internally, to the members of the ruling party and that segment of the population which supports the government. Propaganda consists of the message that a totalitarian government seeks to promote in the outside world, and also among those parts of its own society which may not support the government. Thus, “the necessities for propaganda are always dictated by the outside world,” while the opportunities for indoctrination depend on “the totalitarian governments’ isolation and security from outside interference.” \n\nThe type of indoctrination used by the Soviets and the Nazis was characterized by claims of “scientific” truth, and appeals to “objective laws of nature.” Both movements took a deterministic view of human society and claimed that their ideologies were based on scientific discoveries regarding race (in the case of the Nazis) or the forces governing human history (in the case of the Soviets). Arendt identifies this as being in certain ways similar to modern advertising, in which companies claim that scientific research shows their products to be superior, but more generally she argues that it is an extreme version of “that obsession with science which has characterized the Western world since the rise of mathematics and physics in the sixteenth century.” By their use of pseudoscience as the main justification for their actions, Nazism and Stalinism are distinguished from earlier historical despotic regimes, who appealed instead to religion or sometimes did not try to justify themselves at all. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments did not merely use these appeals to supposed scientific laws as propaganda to manipulate others. Rather, totalitarian leaders like Hitler and Stalin genuinely believed that they were acting in accordance with immutable natural laws, to such an extent that they were willing to sacrifice the self-interest of their regimes for the sake of enacting those supposed laws. For instance, the Nazis treated the inhabitants of occupied territories with extreme brutality and planned to depopulate Eastern Europe in order to make way for colonists from the German “master race,” despite the fact that this actively harmed their war effort. Stalin repeatedly purged the Communist Party of people who deviated even slightly from the party line, even when this weakened the party or the Soviet government, because he believed that they represented the interests of “dying classes” and their demise was historically inevitable.\n\nArendt also identifies the central importance of an all-powerful leader in totalitarian movements. As in other areas, she distinguishes between totalitarian leaders (such as Hitler and Stalin) and non-totalitarian dictators or autocratic leaders. The totalitarian leader does not rise to power by personally using violence or through any special organizational skills, but rather by controlling appointments of personnel within the party, so that all other prominent party members owe their positions to him. With loyalty to the leader becoming the primary criterion for promotion, ambitious party members compete with each other in trying to express their loyalty, and a cult of personality develops around the leader. Even when the leader is not particularly competent and the members of his inner circle are aware of his deficiencies, they remain committed to him out of fear that without him the entire power structure would collapse.\n\nOnce in power, according to Arendt, totalitarian movements face a major dilemma: they built their support on the basis of anger against the status quo and on impossible or dishonest promises, but now they have become the new status quo and are expected to carry out their promises. They deal with this problem by engaging in a constant struggle against external and internal enemies, real or imagined, so as to enable them to say that, in a sense, they have not yet gained the power they need to fulfill their promises. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments must be constantly fighting enemies in order to survive. This explains their apparently irrational behavior, for example when Hitler continued to make territorial demands even after he was offered everything he asked for in the Munich Agreement, or when Stalin unleashed the Great Terror despite the fact that he faced no significant internal opposition.\n\nArendt points out the widespread use of concentration camps by totalitarian governments, arguing that they are the most important manifestation of the need to find enemies to fight against, and are therefore “more essential to the preservation of the regime’s power than any of its other institutions.” Although forced labor was commonly imposed on inmates of concentration camps, Arendt argues that their primary purpose was not any kind of material gain for the regime: “The only permanent economic function of the camps has been the financing of their own supervisory apparatus; thus from the economic point of view the concentration camps exist mostly for their own sake.” The Nazis in particular carried this to the point of “open anti-utility,” by expending large sums of money, resources and manpower – during a war – for the purpose of building and staffing extermination camps and transporting people to them. This sets apart the concentration camps of totalitarian regimes from older human institutions that bear some similarity to them, such as slavery. Slaves were abused and killed for the sake of profit; concentration camp inmates were abused and killed because a totalitarian government needed to justify its existence. Finally, Arendt points out that concentration camps under both Hitler and Stalin included large numbers of inmates who were innocent of any crime – not only in the ordinary sense of the word, but even by the standards of the regimes themselves. That is to say, most of the inmates had not actually committed any action against the regime.\n\nThroughout her analysis, Arendt emphasized the modernity and novelty of the governmental structures set up by Stalin and Hitler, arguing that they represented “an entirely new form of government” which is likely to manifest itself again in various other forms in the future. She also cautioned against the belief that future totalitarian movements would necessarily share the ideological foundations of Nazism or Stalinism, writing that “all ideologies contain totalitarian elements.”\n\nThe totalitarian paradigm in the comparative study of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was further developed by Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski, who wrote extensively on this topic both individually and in collaboration. Similar to Hannah Arendt, they state that “totalitarian dictatorship is a new phenomenon; there has never been anything quite like it before.” Friedrich and Brzezinski classify totalitarian dictatorship as a type of autocracy, but argue that it is different in important ways from most other historical autocracies. In particular, it is distinguished by a reliance on modern technology and mass legitimation. Unlike Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski apply the notion of totalitarian dictatorship not only to the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, but also to the USSR throughout its entire existence, as well as the regime of Benito Mussolini in Italy and the People’s Republic of China under Mao Zedong.\n\nCarl Friedrich noted that the “possibility of equating the dictatorship of Stalin in the Soviet Union and that of Hitler in Germany” has been a deeply controversial topic and a subject of debate almost from the beginning of those dictatorships. Various other aspects of the two regimes have also been the subject of intense scholarly debate, such as whether Nazi and Stalinist ideologies were genuinely believed and pursued by the respective governments, or whether the ideologies were merely convenient justifications for dictatorial rule. Friedrich himself argues in favor of the former view.\n\nFriedrich and Brzezinski argue that Nazism and Stalinism are not only similar to each other, but also represent a continuation or a return to the tradition of European absolute monarchy on certain levels. In the absolute monarchies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the monarch ultimately held all decisional power, and was considered accountable only to God. In Stalinism and Nazism, the leader likewise held all real power, and was considered accountable only to various intangible entities such as “the people”, “the masses” or “the Volk.” Thus the common feature of autocracies – whether monarchical or totalitarian – is the concentration of power in the hands of a leader who cannot be held accountable by any legal mechanisms, and who is supposed to be the embodiment of the will of an abstract entity. Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify other features common to all autocracies, such as “the oscillation between tight and loose control.” The regime alternates between periods of intense repression and periods of relative freedom, often represented by different leaders. This depends in part on the personal character of different leaders, but Friedrich and Brzezinski believe that there is also an underlying political cycle, in which rising discontent leads to increased repression up to the point at which the opposition is eliminated, then controls are relaxed until the next time that popular dissatisfaction begins to grow.\n\nThus, placing Stalinism and Nazism within the broader historical tradition of autocratic government, Friedrich and Brzezinski hold that “totalitarian dictatorship, in a sense, is the adaptation of autocracy to twentieth-century industrial society.” However, at the same time, they insist that totalitarian dictatorship is a “\"novel\" type of autocracy” and argue that twentieth century totalitarian regimes (such as those of Hitler and Stalin) had more in common with each other than with any other form of government, including historical autocracies of the past. Totalitarianism can only exist after the creation of modern technology, because such technology is essential for propaganda, for surveillance of the population, and for the operation of a secret police. Furthermore, when speaking of the differences and similarities between fascist and communist regimes, Friedrich and Brzezinski insist that the two kinds of totalitarian governments are “basically alike” but “not wholly alike” – they are more similar to each other than to other forms of government, but they are not the same. Among the major differences between them, Friedrich and Brzezinski identify in particular the fact that communists seek “the world revolution of the proletariat,” while fascists wish to “establish the imperial predominance of a particular nation or race.” \n\nIn terms of the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, Friedrich lists five main aspects that they hold in common: First, an official ideology that is supposed to be followed by all members of society, at least passively, and which promises to serve as a perfect guide towards some ultimate goal. Second, a single political party, composed of the most enthusiastic supporters of the official ideology, representing an elite group within society (no more than 10 percent of the population), and organized along strictly regimented lines. Third, “a technologically conditioned near-complete monopoly of control of all means of effective armed combat” in the hands of the party or its representatives. Fourth, a similar monopoly held by the party over the mass media and all technological forms of communication. Fifth, “a system of terroristic police control” that is not only used to defend the regime against real enemies, but also to persecute various groups of people who are only suspected of being enemies or who may potentially become enemies in the future.\n\nTwo first pillars of any totalitarian government, according to Friedrich and Brzezinski, are the dictator and the Party. The dictator, whether Stalin, Hitler or Mussolini, holds supreme power. Friedrich and Brzezinski explicitly reject the claim that the Party, or any other institution, could provide a significant counterweight to the power of the dictator in Nazism or Stalinism. The dictator needs the Party in order to be able to rule, so he may be careful not to make decisions that would go directly against the wishes of other leading Party members, but ultimate authority rests with him and not with them. Like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify the cult of personality surrounding the leader as an essential element of a totalitarian dictatorship, and reference Stalin’s personality cult in particular. They also draw attention to the fact that Hitler and Stalin were expected to provide ideological direction for their governments and not merely practical leadership. Friedrich and Brzezinski write that “unlike military dictators in the past, but like certain types of primitive chieftains, the totalitarian dictator is both ruler and high priest.” That is to say, he not only governs, but also provides the principles on which his government is to be based. This is partly due to the way that totalitarian governments arise. They come about when a militant ideological movement seizes power, so the first leader of a totalitarian government is usually the ideologue who built the movement that seized power, and subsequent leaders try to emulate him.\n\nThe totalitarian dictator needs loyal lieutenants to carry out his orders faithfully and with a reasonable degree of efficiency. Friedrich and Brzezinski identify parallels between the men in Hitler and Stalin’s entourage, arguing that both dictators used similar people to perform similar tasks. Thus, for example, Martin Bormann and Georgy Malenkov were both capable administrators and bureaucrats, while Heinrich Himmler and Lavrentiy Beria were ruthless secret police chiefs responsible for suppressing any potential challenge to the dictator’s power. Both Hitler and Stalin promoted rivalry and distrust among their lieutenants so as to ensure that none of them would become powerful enough to challenge the dictator himself. This is the cause of an important weakness of the totalitarian regimes: the problem of succession. Friedrich points out that neither the Nazi nor the Stalinist government ever established any official line of succession or any mechanism to decide who would replace the dictator after his death. The dictator, being the venerated “father of the people,” was regarded as irreplaceable. There could never be any heir apparent, because such an heir would have been a threat to the power of the dictator while he was alive. Thus the dictator’s inevitable death would always leave behind a major power vacuum and cause a political crisis. In the case of the Nazi regime, since Hitler died mere days before the final defeat of Germany in the war, this never became a major issue. In the case of the USSR, Stalin’s death led to a prolonged power struggle.\n\nFriedrich and Brzezinski also identify key similarities between the Nazi and Stalinist political parties, which set them apart from other types of political parties. Both the Nazi Party and the CPSU under Stalin had very strict membership requirements and did not accept members on the basis of mere agreement with the Party’s ideology and goals. Rather, they strictly tested potential members, in a manner similar to exclusive clubs, and often engaged in political purges of the membership, expelling large numbers of people from their ranks (and sometimes arresting and executing those expelled, such as in the Great Purge or the Night of the Long Knives). Thus, the totalitarian party cultivates the idea that to be a member is a privilege which needs to be earned, and total obedience to the leader is required in order to maintain this privilege. While both Nazism and Stalinism required party members to display such total loyalty in practice, they differed in the way they dealt with it in theory. Nazism openly proclaimed the hierarchical ideal of absolute obedience to the Führer as one of its key ideological principles (the \"Führerprinzip\"). Stalinism, meanwhile, denied that it did anything similar, and claimed instead to uphold democratic principles, with the Party Congress (made up of elected delegates) supposedly being the highest authority. However, Stalinist elections typically featured only a single candidate, and the Party Congress met very rarely and simply approved Stalin’s decisions. Thus, regardless of the differences in their underlying ideological claims, the Nazi and Stalinist parties were organized in practice along similar lines, with a rigid hierarchy and centralized leadership.\n\nEach totalitarian party and dictator is supported by a specific totalitarian ideology. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue, in agreement with Arendt, that Nazi and Stalinist leaders really believed in their respective ideologies and did not merely use them as tools to gain power. Several major policies, such as the Stalinist collectivization of agriculture or the Nazi “final solution”, cannot be explained by anything other than a genuine commitment to achieve ideological goals, even at great cost. The ideologies were different and their goals were different, but what they had in common was a utopian commitment to reshaping the world, and a determination to fight by any means necessary against a real or imagined enemy. This stereotyped enemy could be described as “the fat rich Jew or the Jewish Bolshevik” for the Nazis, or “the war-mongering, atom-bomb-wielding American Wallstreeter” for the Soviets.\n\nAccording to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most important difference between Nazi and Stalinist ideology lies in the degree of universality involved. Stalinism, and communist ideology in general, is universal in its appeal and addresses itself to all the “workers of the world.” Nazism, on the other hand, and fascist ideology in general, can only address itself to one particular race or nation – the “master race” that is destined to dominate all others. Therefore, “in communism social justice appears to be the ultimate value, unless it be the classless society that is its essential condition; in fascism, the highest value is dominion, eventually world dominion, and the strong and pure nation-race is \"its\" essential condition, as seen by its ideology.” This means that fascist or Nazi movements from different countries will be natural enemies, rather than natural allies, as they each seek to extend the dominion of their own nation at the expense of others. Friedrich and Brzezinski see this as a weakness inherent in fascist and Nazi ideology, while communist universalism is a source of ideological strength for Stalinism.\n\nFriedrich and Brzezinski also draw attention to the symbols used by Nazis and Stalinists to represent themselves. The Soviet Union adopted the hammer and sickle, a newly-created symbol, “invented by the leaders of the movement and pointing to the future.” Meanwhile, Nazi Germany used the swastika, “a ritual symbol of uncertain origin, quite common in primitive societies.” Thus, one is trying to project itself as being oriented towards a radically new future, while the other is appealing to a mythical heroic past.\n\nTotalitarian dictatorships maintain themselves in power through the use of propaganda and terror, which Friedrich and Brzezinski believe to be closely connected. Terror may be enforced with arrests and executions of dissenters, but it can also take more subtle forms, such as the threat of losing one’s job, social stigma and defamation. “Terror” can refer to any widespread method used to intimidate people into submission as a matter of daily life. According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most effective terror is invisible to the people it affects. They simply develop a habit of acting in a conformist manner and not questioning authority, without necessarily being aware that this is what they are doing. Thus, terror creates a society dominated by apparent consensus, where the vast majority of the population appears to support the government. Propaganda is then used to maintain this appearance of popular consent. \n\nTotalitarian propaganda is one of the features that distinguishes totalitarian regimes as modern forms of government and separates them from older autocracies, since a totalitarian government holds complete control over all means of communication (not only public communication such as the mass media, but also private communication such as letters and telephone calls, which are strictly monitored). The methods of propaganda were very similar in the Stalinist USSR and in Nazi Germany. Both Joseph Goebbels and Soviet propagandists sought to demonize their enemies and present a picture of a united people standing behind its leader to confront foreign threats. In both cases there was no attempt to convey complex ideological nuances to the masses, with the message being instead about a simplistic struggle between good and evil. Both Nazi and Stalinist regimes produced two very different sets of propaganda – one for internal consumption and one for potential sympathizers in other countries. And both regimes would sometimes radically change their propaganda line as they made peace with a former enemy or got into a war with a former ally. Yet, paradoxically, a totalitarian government’s complete control over communications renders that government highly misinformed. With no way for anyone to express criticism, the dictator has no way of knowing how much support he actually has among the general populace. With all government policies always declared successful in propaganda, officials are unable to determine what actually worked and what didn’t. Both Stalinism and Nazism suffered from this problem, especially during the war between them. As the war turned against Germany, there was growing opposition to Hitler’s rule, including within the ranks of the military, but Hitler was never aware of this until it was too late (see: 20 July plot). In 1948, during the early days of the Berlin Blockade, the Soviet leadership apparently believed that the population of West Berlin was sympathetic to Soviet Communism and that they would request to join the Soviet zone. Given enough time, the gap between real public opinion and what the totalitarian government believes about public opinion can grow so wide that the government is no longer able to even produce effective propaganda, because it does not know what the people actually think and so it does not know what to tell them. Friedrich and Brzezinski refer to this as the “ritualization of propaganda”: the totalitarian regime continues to produce propaganda as a political ritual, with little real impact on public opinion.\n\nThe totalitarian use of mass arrests, executions and concentration camps – also noted by Arendt – was analyzed at length by Friedrich and Brzezinski. They hold that “totalitarian terror maintains, in institutionalized form, the civil war that originally produced the totalitarian movement and by means of which the regime is able to proceed with its program, first of social disintegration and then of social reconstruction.” Both Stalinism and Nazism saw themselves as engaging in a life-or-death struggle against implacable enemies. But to declare that the struggle had been won would have meant to declare that most of the totalitarian features of the government were no longer needed. A secret police force, for instance, has no reason to exist if there are no dangerous traitors who need to be found. Thus the struggle, or “civil war” against internal enemies, must be institutionalized and must continue indefinitely. In the Stalinist USSR, the repressive apparatus was eventually turned against members of the Communist Party itself in the Great Purge and the show trials that accompanied it. Nazism, by contrast, had a much shorter lifespan in power, and Nazi terror generally maintained an outward focus, with the extermination of the Jews always given top priority. The Nazis did not turn inward towards purging their own party except in a limited way on two occasions (the Night of the Long Knives and the aftermath of the 20 July plot). \n\nThe peak of totalitarian terror was reached with the Nazi concentration camps. These ranged from labor camps to extermination camps, and they are described by Friedrich and Brzezinski as aiming to “eliminate all actual, potential, and imagined enemies of the regime.” As the field of Holocaust studies was still in its early stages at the time of their writing, they do not describe the conditions in detail, but do refer to the camps as involving “extreme viciousness.” They also compare these camps with the Soviet Gulag system, and highlight the use of concentration camps as a method of punishment and execution by Nazi and Stalinist regimes alike. However, unlike Hannah Arendt, who held that the Gulag camps served no economic purpose, Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that they provided an important source of cheap labor for the Stalinist economy.\n\nThe comparative study of Nazism and Stalinism was carried further by other groups of scholars, such as Moshe Lewin and Ian Kershaw together with their collaborators. Writing after the dissolution of the USSR, Lewin and Kershaw take a longer historical perspective and regard Nazism and Stalinism not so much as examples of a new type of society (like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski did), but more as historical “anomalies” – unusual deviations from the typical path of development that most industrial societies are expected to follow. Therefore, the task of comparing Nazism and Stalinism is, to them, a task of explaining why Germany and Russia (along with other countries) deviated from the historical norm. At the outset, Lewin and Kershaw identify similarities between the historical situations in Germany and Russia prior to the First World War and during that war. Both countries were ruled by authoritarian monarchies, who were under pressure to make concessions to popular demands. Both countries had “powerful bureaucracies and strong military traditions.” Both had “powerful landowning classes,” while also being in the process of rapid industrialization and modernization. And both countries had expansionist foreign policies with a particular interest in Central and Eastern Europe. Lewin and Kershaw do not claim that these factors made Stalinism or Nazism inevitable, but rather that they help to explain why the Stalinist and Nazi regimes developed similar features.\n\nIan Kershaw admitted that Stalinism and Nazism are comparable in “the nature and extent of their inhumanity,” but noted that the two regimes were different in a number of aspects Lewin and Kershaw question the usefulness of grouping the Stalinist and Nazi regimes together under a “totalitarian” category, saying that it remains an open question whether the similarities between them are greater or smaller than the differences. In particular, they criticize what they see as the ideologically-motivated attempt to determine which regime killed more people, saying that apologists of each regime are trying to defend their side by claiming the other was responsible for more deaths.\n\nLewin and Kershaw place the cult of personality at the center of their comparison of Nazism and Stalinism, writing that both regimes “represented a new genre of political system centred upon the artificial construct of a leadership cult – the ‘heroic myth’ of the ‘great leader’, no longer a king or emperor but a ‘man of the people.” With regard to Stalinism, they emphasize its bureaucratic character, and its “merging of the most modern with the most archaic traits” by combining modern technology and the latest methods of administration and propaganda with the ancient practice of arbitrary rule by a single man. They compare this with the Prussian military tradition in Germany, which had been called “bureaucratic absolutism” in the eighteenth century, and which played a significant role in the organization of the Nazi state in the twentieth century.\n\nKershaw agrees with Mommsen that there was a fundamental difference between Nazism and Stalinism regarding the importance of the leader. Stalinism had an absolute leader, but he was not essential. He could be replaced by another. Nazism, on the other hand, was a “classic charismatic leadership movement,” defined entirely by its leader. Stalinism had an ideology which existed independently of Stalin. But for Nazism, “Hitler \"was\" ideological orthodoxy” – Nazi ideals were by definition whatever Hitler said they were. In Stalinism, the bureaucratic apparatus was the foundation of the system, while in Nazism, the person of the leader was the foundation.\n\nMoshe Lewin also focuses on the comparison between the personality cults of Hitler and Stalin, and their respective roles in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. He refers to them as the “Hitler myth” and the “Stalin myth,” and argues that they served different functions within their two regimes. The function of the “Hitler myth” was to legitimize Nazi rule. The function of the “Stalin myth” was to legitimize not Soviet rule itself, but Stalin’s leadership within the Party. Stalin’s personality cult existed precisely because Stalin knew that he was replaceable, and feared that he might be replaced, and so needed to bolster his authority as much as possible. While the “Hitler myth” was essential to Nazi Germany, the “Stalin myth” was essential only to Stalin, not to the Soviet Union itself.\n\nTogether with fellow historian Hans Mommsen, Lewin argues that the Stalinist and Nazi regimes featured an “intrinsic structural contradiction” which led to “inherent self-destructiveness”: they depended on a highly organized state bureaucracy which was trying to set up complex rules and procedures for every aspect of life, yet this bureaucracy was under the complete personal control of a despot who made policy decisions as he saw fit, routinely changing his mind on major issues, without any regard for the rules and institutions which his own bureaucracy had set up. The bureaucracy and the leader needed each other, but also undermined each other with their different priorities. Mommsen sees this as being a much greater problem in Nazi Germany than in Stalin’s Soviet Union, as the Nazis inherited large parts of the traditional German bureaucracy, while the Soviets largely built their own bureaucracy from the ground up. He argues that many of the irrational features of the Nazi regime – such as wasting resources on exterminating undesirable populations instead of using those resources in the war effort – were caused by the dysfunction of the Nazi state rather than by fanatical commitment to Nazi ideology. In accordance with the Führerprinzip, all decisional power in the Nazi state ultimately rested with Hitler. But Hitler often issued only vague and general directives, forcing other Nazi leaders lower down in the hierarchy to guess what precisely the Führer wanted. This confusion produced competition between Nazi officials, as each of them attempted to prove that he was a more dedicated Nazi than his rivals, by engaging in ever more extreme policies. This competition to please Hitler was, according to Mommsen, the real cause of Nazi irrationality. Hitler was aware of it, and deliberately encouraged it out of a “social-darwinist conviction that the best man would ultimately prevail.” Mommsen argues that this represents a structural difference between the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. In spite of its purges, Stalin’s regime was more effective in building a stable bureaucracy, such that it was possible for the system to sustain itself and continue even without Stalin. The Nazi regime, on the other hand, was much more personalized and depended entirely on Hitler, being unable to build any lasting institutions.\n\nKershaw also saw major personal differences between Stalin and Hitler and their respective styles of rule. He describes Stalin as “a committee man, chief oligarch, man of the machine” and a “creature of his party,” who came to power only thanks to his party and his ability to manipulate the levers of power within that party. Hitler, by contrast, came to power based on his charisma and mass appeal, and in the Nazi regime it was the leader that created the party instead of the other way around. According to Kershaw, “Stalin was a highly interventionist dictator, sending a stream of letters and directives determining or interfering with policy,” while Hitler “was a non-interventionist dictator as far as government administration was concerned,” preferring to involve himself in military affairs and plans for conquest rather than the daily routine of government work, and giving only broad verbal instructions to his subordinates regarding civilian affairs, which they were expected to translate into policy. Furthermore, although both regimes featured all-pervasive cults of personality, there was a qualitative difference between those cults. Stalin’s personality cult was “superimposed upon the Marxist-Leninist ideology and Communist Party,” and could be abandoned (or replaced with a personality cult around some other leader) without major changes to the regime. On the other hand, “the ‘Hitler myth’ was structurally indispensable to, in fact the very basis of, and scarcely distinguishable from, the Nazi Movement and its \"Weltanschauung\".” The belief in the person of Adolf Hitler as the unique savior of the German nation was the very foundation of Nazism, to such an extent that Nazism found it impossible to even imagine a successor to Hitler. Thus, in Kershaw’s analysis, Stalinism was a fundamentally bureaucratic system while Nazism was the embodiment of “charismatic authority” as described by Max Weber. Stalinism could exist without its leader. Nazism could not. \n\nThe topic of comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism was also studied in the 1990s and 2000s by historians Henry Rousso, Nicolas Werth and Philippe Burrin.\n\nRousso defends the work of Carl Friedrich by pointing out that Friedrich himself had only said that Stalinism and Nazism were comparable, not that they were identical. Rousso also argues that the popularity of the concept of totalitarianism (the way that large numbers of people have come to routinely refer to certain governments as “totalitarian”) should be seen as evidence that the concept is useful, that it really describes a specific type of government which is different from other dictatorships. At the same time, however, Rousso notes that the concept of totalitarianism is descriptive rather than analytical: the regimes described as totalitarian do not have a common origin and did not arise in similar ways. Nazism is unique among totalitarian regimes in having taken power in “a country endowed with an advanced industrial economy and with a system of political democracy (and an even older political pluralism).” All other examples of totalitarianism (including the Stalinist regime) took power, according to Rousso, “in an agrarian economy, in a poor society without a tradition of political pluralism, not to mention democracy, and where diverse forms of tyranny had traditionally prevailed.” He sees this as a weakness of the concept of totalitarianism, because it merely describes the similarities between Stalinism and Nazism without dealing with the very different ways they came to power. On the other hand, Rousso agrees with Hannah Arendt that “totalitarian regimes constitute something new in regard to classical tyranny, authoritarian regimes, or other forms of ancient and medieval dictatorships,” and he says that the main strength of the concept of totalitarianism is the way it highlights this inherent novelty of the regimes involved.\n\nNicolas Werth and Philippe Burrin have worked together on comparative assessments of Stalinism and Nazism, with Werth covering the Stalinist regime and Burrin covering Nazi Germany. One of the topics they have studied is the question of how much power the dictator really held in the two regimes. Werth identifies two main historiographical approaches in the study of the Stalinist regime: Those who emphasize the power and control exercised by Joseph Stalin himself, attributing most of the actions of the Soviet government to deliberate plans and decisions made by him, and those who argue that Stalin had no pre-determined course of action in mind, that he was reacting to events as they unfolded, and that the Soviet bureaucracy had its own agenda which often differed from Stalin’s wishes. Werth regards these as two mistaken extremes, one making Stalin seem all-powerful, the other making him seem like a weak dictator. But he believes that the competing perspectives are useful in drawing attention to the tension between two different forms of organization in the Stalinist USSR: an “administrative system of command,” bureaucratic and resistant to change but effective in running the Soviet state, and the strategy of “running the country in a crudely despotic way by Stalin and his small cadre of directors.” Thus, Werth agrees with Lewin that there was an inherent conflict between the priorities of the Soviet bureaucracy and Stalin’s accumulation of absolute power in his own hands. According to Werth, it was this unresolved and unstated conflict that led to the Great Purge and to the use of terror by Stalin’s regime against its own party and state cadres.\n\nIn studying similar issues with regard to the Nazi regime, Philippe Burrin draws attention to the debate between the “Intentionalist” and “Functionalist” schools of thought, which dealt with the question of whether the Nazi regime represented an extension of Hitler’s autocratic will, faithfully obeying his wishes, or whether it was an essentially chaotic and uncontrollable system that functioned on its own with little direct input from the Führer. Like Kershaw and Lewin, Burrin says that the relationship between the leader and his party’s ideology was different in Nazism compared to Stalinism: “One can rightly state that Nazism cannot be dissociated from Hitlerism, something that is difficult to affirm for Bolshevism and Stalinism.” Unlike Stalin, who inherited an existing system with an existing ideology and presented himself as the heir to the Leninist political tradition, Hitler created both his movement and its ideology by himself, claiming to be “someone sent by Providence, a Messiah whom the German people had been expecting for centuries, even for two thousand years, as Heinrich Himmler enjoyed saying.” Thus, there could be no real conflict between the Party and the leader in Nazi Germany, because the Nazi Party’s entire reason for existence was to support and follow Hitler. However, there was a potential for division between the leader and the state bureaucracy, due to the way that Nazism came to power – as part of an alliance with traditional conservative elites, industrialists, and the army. Unlike the USSR, Nazi Germany did not build its own state, but rather inherited the state machinery of the previous government. This provided the Nazis with an immediate supply of capable and experienced managers and military commanders, but on the other hand it also meant that the Nazi regime had to rely on the cooperation of people who had not been Nazis prior to Hitler’s rise to power, and whose loyalty was questionable. It was only during the war, when Nazi Germany conquered large territories and had to create Nazi administrations for them, that brand new Nazi bureaucracies were created without any input or participation from traditional German elites. This produced a surprising difference between Nazism and Stalinism: When the Stalinist USSR conquered territory, it created smaller copies of itself and installed them as the governments of the occupied countries. When Nazi Germany conquered territory, on the other hand, it did not attempt to create copies of the German government back home. Instead, it experimented with different power structures and policies, often reflecting a “far more ample Nazification of society than what the balance of power authorized in the Reich.”\n\nAnother major topic investigated by Werth and Burrin was the violence and terror employed by the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Werth reports that the Stalinist USSR underwent an “extraordinary brutalization of the relations between state and society” for the purpose of rapid modernization and industrialization, to “gain one hundred years in one decade, and to metamorphose the country into a great industrial power.” This transformation was accomplished at the cost of massive violence and a sociopolitical regression into what Werth calls “military-feudal exploitation.” The types of violence employed by the Stalinist regime included loss of civil rights, mass arrests, deportations of entire ethnic groups from one part of the USSR to another, forced labor in the Gulag, mass executions (especially during the Great Terror of 1937-38), and most of all the great famine of 1932-33, known as the Holodomor. All levels of Soviet society were affected by Stalinist repression, from the top to the bottom. At the top, high-ranking members of the Communist Party were arrested and executed under the claim that they had plotted against Stalin (and in some cases they were forced to confess to imaginary crimes in show trials). At the bottom, the peasantry suffered the Holodomor famine (especially in Ukraine), and even outside of the famine years they were faced with very high grain quotas.\n\nWerth identifies four categories of people that became the targets of Stalinist violence in the USSR. He lists them from smallest to largest. The first and smallest group consisted of many of Stalin’s former comrades-in-arms, who had participated in the revolution and were known as “Old Bolsheviks.” They were dangerous to Stalin because they had known him before his rise to power and could expose the many false claims made by his personality cult. The second group consisted of mid-level Communist Party officials, who were subject to mass arrests and executions in the late 1930s, particularly during the Great Purge. Eliminating them served a dual purpose: It helped Stalin to centralize power in the Kremlin (as opposed to regional centers), and it also provided him with “corrupt officials” that he could blame for earlier repressions and unpopular policies. Werth draws parallels between this and the old Tsarist tradition of blaming “bad bureaucrats” – rather than the Tsar – for unpopular government actions. The third group was made up of ordinary citizens from all walks of life who resorted to petty crime in order to provide for themselves in the face of worsening living standards (for example by taking home some wheat from the fields or tools from the factory). This type of petty crime became very widespread, and was often punished as if it were intentional sabotage motivated by political opposition to the USSR. The fourth and largest category consisted of ethnic groups that were subject to deportation, famine, or arbitrary arrests under the suspicion of being collectively disloyal to Stalin or to the Soviet state. This included the Holodomor famine directed at the Ukrainians, the deportation of ethnic groups suspected of pro-German sympathies (such as the Volga Germans, the Crimean Tatars, the Chechens and others), and eventually also persecution of ethnic Jews, especially as Stalin grew increasingly antisemitic near the end of his life.\n\nBurrin’s study of violence carried out by the Nazi regime begins with the observation that “violence is at the heart of Nazism,” and that Nazi violence is “established as a doctrine and exalted in speech.” This marks a point of difference between Nazism and Stalinism, according to Burrin. In Stalinism, there was a gulf between ideology and reality when it came to violence. The Soviet regime continuously denied that it was repressive, proclaimed itself a defender of peace, and sought to conceal all the evidence to the contrary. In Nazism, on the other hand, “doctrine and reality were fused from the start.” Nazism not only practiced violent repression and war, but advocated it in principle as well, considering war to be a positive force in human civilization and openly seeking ”living space” and the domination of the European continent by ethnic Germans.\n\nBurrin identifies three motivations for Nazi violence: political repression, exclusion and social repression, and racial politics. The first of these, political repression, is common in many dictatorships. The Nazis aimed to eliminate their real or imagined political opponents, first in the Reich and later in the occupied territories during the war. Some of these opponents were executed, while others were imprisoned in concentration camps. The first targets of political repression, immediately after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, were the parties of the Left in general and the Communists in particular. Then, after the mid-1930s, repression was extended to members of the clergy, and later to the conservative opposition as well (especially after the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944). The death penalty was used on a wide scale, even before the war. During the war, political repression was greatly expanded both inside Germany and especially in the newly occupied territories. Political prisoners in the concentration camps numbered only about 25,000 at the beginning of the war. By January 1945 they had swelled to 714,211 – most of them non-Germans accused of plotting against the Reich.\n\nThe second type of Nazi violence, motivated by exclusion and social repression, was the violence aimed at purging German society of people whose lifestyle was considered incompatible with the social norms of the Nazi regime (even if the people involved were racially pure and able-bodied). Such people were divided into two categories: homosexuals and “asocials.” The “asocials” were only vaguely defined, and included “Gypsies, tramps, beggars, prostitutes, alcoholics, the jobless who refused any employment, and those who left their work frequently or for no reason.”\n\nThe third and final type of Nazi violence, by far the most extensive, was violence motivated by Nazi racial policies. This was aimed both inward, to cleanse the “Aryan race” of “degenerate” elements and life unworthy of life, as well as outward, to seek the extermination of “inferior races”. Germans considered physically or mentally unfit were among the first victims. One of the first laws of the Nazi regime mandated the forced sterilization of people suffering from physical handicaps or who had psychiatric conditions deemed to be hereditary. Later, sterilization was replaced by murder of the mentally ill and of people with severe disabilities, as part of a “euthanasia” program called Aktion T4. Burrin notes that this served no practical political purpose – the people being murdered could not have possibly been political opponents of the regime – so the motivation was purely a matter of racial ideology. The most systematic and by far the most large-scale acts of Nazi violence, however, were directed at “racially inferior” non-German populations. As laid out in \"Generalplan Ost\", the Nazis wished to eliminate most of the Slavic populations of Eastern Europe, partly through deportation and partly through murder, in order to secure land for ethnic German settlement and colonization. But even more urgently, the Nazis wished to exterminate the Jews of Europe, whom they regarded as the implacable racial enemy of the Germans. This culminated in the Holocaust, the Nazi genocide of the Jews. Unlike in the case of all other target populations, the Jews were to be exterminated completely, with no individual exceptions for any reason.\n\nIn \"Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared\", editors Michael Geyer and Sheila Fitzpatrick disputed the concept of totalitarianism, noting that the term entered political discourse first as a term of self-description by the Italian Fascists and was only later used as a framework to compare Nazi Germany with the Soviet Union. They argued that the totalitarian states were not as monolithic or as ideology-driven as they seemed. Geyer and Fitzpatrick describe Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR as “immensely powerful, threatening, and contagious dictatorships” who “shook the world in their antagonism.” Without calling them totalitarian, they identified their common features, including genocide, an all-powerful party, a charismatic leader, and pervasive invasion of privacy. However, they argue that Stalinism and Nazism did not represent a new and unique type of government, but rather that they can be placed in the broader context of the turn to dictatorship in Europe in the interwar period. The reason they appear extraordinary is because they were the “most prominent, most hard-headed, and most violent” of the European dictatorships of the 20th century. They are comparable because of their “shock and awe” and sheer ruthlessness, but underneath superficial similarities they were fundamentally different and that “when it comes to one-on-one comparison, the two societies and regimes may as well have hailed from different worlds.”\n\nAccording to Geyer and Fitzpatrick, the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism stem from the fact that they were both “ideology driven” and sought to subordinate all aspects of life to their respective ideologies. The differences stem from the fact that their ideologies were opposed to each other and regarded each other as enemies. Another major difference is that Stalin created a stable and long-lasting regime, while Nazi Germany had a “short-lived, explosive nature.” Notably, the stable state created by Stalinism was based on an entirely new elite, while Nazism, despite having the support of the traditional elite, failed to achieve stability.\n\nHowever, the two regimes did borrow ideas from one another, especially regarding propaganda techniques (most of all in architecture and cinema), but also in terms of state surveillance and antisemitism. At the same time, they both vigorously denied borrowing anything from each other. While their methods of propaganda were similar, the content was different. For instance, Soviet wartime propaganda revolved around the idea of resisting imperial aggression, while Nazi propaganda was about wars of racial conquest. Geyer and Fitzpatrick also take note of the fact that both Stalinism and Nazism sought to create a New Man, an “entirely modern, illiberal, and self-fashioned personage,” even though they had different visions about what being a “New Man” would mean.\n\nAmong the other authors contributing to the volume edited by Geyer and Fitzpatrick, David Hoffmann and Annette Timm discuss biopolitics and the pro-natalist policies of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. Both governments were highly concerned over low fertility rates in their respective populations, and applied extensive and intrusive social engineering techniques to increase the number of births. Reproductive policies in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were administered through their health care systems—both regimes saw health care as a key pillar to their designs to develop a new society. While the Soviet Union had to design a public health care system from scratch, Nazi Germany built upon the pre-existing public health care system in Germany that had existed since 1883, when Otto von Bismarck's legislation had created the world's first national public health care program. The Nazis centralized the German health care system in order to enforce Nazi ideological components upon it, and replaced existing voluntary and government welfare agencies with new ones that were devoted to racial hygiene and other components of Nazi ideology.\n\nThe Nazi and Stalinist attempt to control family size was not unique, as many other European states practiced eugenics at this time, and the Stalinist and Nazi ideals were vastly different. In fact, they had more in common with third parties than with each other: Nazi Germany’s policies were rather similar to those in Scandinavia at the time, while the USSR’s policies resembled those in Catholic countries.The common point between Nazi and Stalinist practices was the connection of reproduction policies with the ideological goals of the state — \"part of the project of a rational, hypermodern vision for the re-organization of society\". There were nevertheless substantial differences between the two regimes' approaches. Stalin's Soviet Union never officially supported eugenics as the Nazis did—the Soviet government called eugenics a \"fascist science\"—although there were in fact Soviet eugenicists. The two regimes also had different approaches to the relationship between family and paid labor—Nazism promoted the male single-breadwinner family while Stalinism promoted the dual-wage-earner household.\n\nIn another contribution to the same volume, Christian Gerlach and Nicolas Werth discuss the topic of mass violence, and the way that it was used by both Stalinism and Nazism. Both Stalin's Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were violent societies where mass violence was accepted by the state, such as in the Great Terror of 1937 to 1938 in the Soviet Union and the Holocaust in Nazi Germany and its occupied territories in World War II.\n\nBoth the Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany utilized internment camps led by agents of the state – the NKVD in the Soviet Union and the SS in Nazi Germany. They also both engaged in violence against minorities based on xenophobia – the xenophobic violence of the Nazis was outspoken but rationalized as being against \"asocial\" elements while the xenophobic violence of the Stalinists was disguised as being against \"anti-soviet\", \"counter-revolutionary\" and \"socially harmful\" elements – a term which often targeted diaspora nationalities. The Stalinist Soviet Union established \"special settlements\" where the \"socially harmful\" or \"socially dangerous\" who included ex-convicts, criminals, vagrants, the disenfranchised and \"declassed elements\" were expelled to. These \"special settlements\" were largely in Siberia, the far north, the Urals, or other inhospitable territories. In July 1933, the Soviet Union made a mass arrest of 5000 Romani people effectively on the basis of their ethnicity, who were deported that month to the \"special settlements\" in Western Siberia. In 1935, the Soviet Union arrested 160,000 homeless people and juvenile delinquents and sent many of them to NKVD labor colonies where they did forced labor.\n\nThe Nazi regime was founded upon a racialist view of politics and envisioned the deportation or extermination of the majority of the population of Eastern Europe in order to open up “living space” for ethnic German settlers. This was mainly intended to be carried out after an eventual German victory in the war, but steps had already started being taken while the war was still ongoing. For instance, by the end of 1942, the Nazis had deported 365,000 Poles and Jews from their original homes in western Poland (now German-annexed) and into the General Government. A further 194,000 Poles were internally displaced (not deported to another territory but expelled from their homes). The Nazis had also deported 100,000 persons from Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, as well as 54,000 Slovenians.\n\nStalinism in practice in the Soviet Union pursued ethnic deportations from the 1930s to the early 1950s, with a total of 3 million Soviet citizens being subjected to ethnic-based resettlement. The first major ethnic deportation took place from December 1932 to January 1933, during which some 60,000 Kuban Cossacks were collectively criminally charged as a whole with association with resistance to socialism and affiliation with Ukrainian nationalism. From 1935 to 1936, the Soviet Union deported Soviet citizens of Polish and German origins living in the western districts of Ukraine, and Soviet citizens of Finnish origins living on the Finland-Soviet Union border. These deportations from 1935 to 1936 affected tens of thousands of families. From September to October 1937, Soviet authorities deported the Korean minority from its Far Eastern region that bordered on Japanese-controlled Korea. Soviet authorities claimed the territory was \"rich soil for the Japanese to till\" – implying a Soviet suspicion that the Koreans could potentially join forces with the Japanese to unite the land with Japanese-held Korea. Over 170,000 Koreans were deported to remote parts of Soviet Central Asia from September to October 1937. These ethnically-based deportations reflected a new trend in Stalinist policy, a \"Soviet xenophobia\" based on ideological grounds that suspected that these people were susceptible to foreign influence, and which was also based on a resurgent Russian nationalism.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941, the Soviet Union initiated another major round of ethnic deportations. The first group targeted were Soviet Germans. Between September 1941 and February 1942, 900,000 people – over 70 percent of the entire Soviet German community – were deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia in mass operations. A second wave of mass deportations took place between November 1943 and May 1944, in which Soviet authorities expelled six ethnic groups (the Balkars, Chechens, Crimean Tatars, Ingush, Karachai, and Kalmyks) that together numbered 900,000. There were also smaller-scale operations involving ethnic cleansing of diaspora minorities during and after World War II, in which tens of thousands of Crimean Bulgarians, Greeks, Iranians, Khemshils, Kurds, and Meskhetian Turks were deported from the Black Sea and Transcaucasian border regions.\n\nTwo ethnic groups that were specifically targeted for persecution by Stalin's Soviet Union were the Chechens and the Ingush. Unlike the other nationalities that could be suspected of connection to foreign states which shared their ethnic background, the Chechens and the Ingush were completely indigenous people of the Soviet Union. Rather than being accused of collaboration with foreign enemies, these two ethnic groups were considered to have cultures which did not fit in with Soviet culture – such as accusing Chechens of being associated with “banditism” – and the authorities claimed that the Soviet Union had to intervene in order to “remake” and “reform” these cultures. In practice this meant heavily armed punitive operations carried out against Chechen “bandits” that failed to achieve forced assimilation, culminating in an ethnic cleansing operation in 1944, which involved the arrests and deportation of over 500,000 Chechens and Ingush from the Caucasus to Central Asia and Kazakhstan. The deportations of the Chechens and Ingush also involved the outright massacre of thousands of people, and severe conditions placed upon the deportees – they were put in unsealed train cars, with little to no food for a four-week journey during which many died from hunger and exhaustion.\n\nThe main difference between Nazi and Stalinist deportations was in their purpose: while Nazi Germany sought ethnic cleansing to allow settlement by Germans into the cleansed territory, Stalin's Soviet Union pursued ethnic cleansing in order to remove minorities from strategically important areas.\n\nOther historians and political scientists have also made comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism as part of their work.\n\nStanley Payne, in his work on fascism, said that although the Nazi Party was ideologically opposed to communism, Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders frequently expressed recognition that only in Soviet Russia were their revolutionary and ideological counterparts to be found. Both placed a major emphasis on creating a \"party-army,\" with the regular armed forces controlled by the party. In the case of the Soviet Union this was done through the political commissars, while Nazi Germany introduced a roughly equivalent leadership role for \"National Socialist Guidance Officers\" in 1943.\n\nFrançois Furet, in his work on communism, noted that Hitler personally admired Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and on numerous occasions publicly praised Stalin for seeking to purify the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of Jewish influences, especially by purging Jewish communists such as Leon Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and Karl Radek.\n\nRichard Pipes draws attention to Stalin and his antisemitism in a parallel with Nazi antisemitism. He notes that soon after the 1917 October Revolution, the Soviet Union undertook practices to break up Jewish culture, religion and language. In the fall of 1918, the Soviet Communist Party set up the Jewish section Yevsektsiya, with a stated mission of “destruction of traditional Jewish life, the Zionist movement, and Hebrew culture.” By 1919, the Bolsheviks began to confiscate Jewish properties, Hebrew schools, libraries, books, and synagogues in accordance with newly imposed anti-religious laws, turning their buildings into \"Communist centers, clubs or restaurants.\" After Joseph Stalin rose to power, antisemitism continued to be endemic throughout Russia, although official Soviet policy condemned it. On August 12, 1952, Stalin's personal antisemitism became more visible, as he ordered the execution of the most prominent Yiddish authors in the Soviet Union, in an event known as the \"Night of the Murdered Poets\". Shortly before his death, Stalin also organized the anti-Semitic campaign known as the Doctors' plot.\n\nA number of research institutions are focusing on the analysis of fascism/Nazism and Stalinism/communism, and the comparative approach, including the Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism in Germany, the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes in the Czech Republic and the Institute of National Remembrance in Poland.\n\nIn comparing the deaths caused by both Stalin and Hitler's policies, some historians have asserted that archival evidence released after the collapse of the USSR confirms that Stalin did not kill more people than Hitler. American historian Timothy D. Snyder, for example, after assessing such data, says that while the Nazi regime killed approximately 11 million non-combatants (which rises to above 12 million if \"foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included\"), Stalin's deliberately killed about 6 million (rising to 9 million if foreseeable deaths arising from policies are taken into account). Australian historian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft posits that \"The Stalinist regime was consequently responsible for about a million purposive killings, and through its criminal neglect and irresponsibility it was probably responsible for the premature deaths of about another two million more victims amongst the repressed population, i.e. in the camps, colonies, prisons, exile, in transit and in the POW camps for Germans. These are clearly much lower figures than those for whom Hitler's regime was responsible.\" Wheatcroft also says that, unlike Hitler, Stalin's \"purposive killings\" fit more closely into the category of \"execution\" than \"murder\", given he thought the accused were indeed guilty of crimes against the state and insisted on documentation, whereas Hitler simply wanted to kill Jews and communists because of who they were, and insisted on no documentation and was indifferent at even a pretence of legality for these actions.\n\nKristen R. Ghodsee, an ethnographer of post-Cold War Eastern Europe, contends that the efforts to institutionalize the \"double genocide thesis\", or the moral equivalence between the Nazi Holocaust (race murder) and the victims of communism (class murder), and in particular the recent push at the beginning of the global financial crisis for commemoration of the latter in Europe, can be seen as the response by economic and political elites to fears of a leftist resurgence in the face of devastated economies and extreme inequalities in both the East and West as the result of neoliberal capitalism. She notes that any discussion of the achievements under communism, including literacy, education, women’s rights, and social security is usually silenced, and any discourse on the subject of communism is focused almost exclusively on Stalin's crimes and the \"double genocide thesis\", an intellectual paradigm summed up as such: \"1) any move towards redistribution and away from a completely free market is seen as communist; 2) anything communist inevitably leads to class murder; and 3) class murder is the moral equivalent of the Holocaust.\" By linking all leftist and socialist ideals to the excesses of Stalinism, Ghodsee concludes, the elites in the West hope to discredit and marginalize all political ideologies that could \"threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.\"\n\nThe comparison of Stalinism and Nazism remains a neglected field of academic study.\n\nThe comparison of Nazism and Stalinism has long provoked political controversy, and it led to the historians' dispute within Germany in the 1980s.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), under the leadership of Chancellor Hermann Müller, adopted the view that \"red equals brown\", i.e. that the communists and Nazis posed an equal danger to liberal democracy. In 1930, Kurt Schumacher said that the two movements enabled each other. He argued that the Communist Party of Germany, which was staunchly Stalinist, were \"red-painted Nazis.\" This comparison was mirrored by the social fascism theory advanced by the Soviet government and the Comintern (including the Communist Party of Germany), which accused social democracy of enabling fascism and went as far as to call social democrats \"social fascists.\" After the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was announced, \"The New York Times\" published an editorial arguing that \"Hitlerism is brown communism, Stalinism is red fascism.\"\n\nMarxist theories of fascism have seen fascism as a form of reaction to socialism and a feature of capitalism. Several modern historians have tried to pay more attention to the economic, political and ideological differences between these two regimes than to their similarities. \n\nThe 2008 Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism, initiated by the Czech government and signed by figures such as Václav Havel, called for \"a common approach regarding crimes of totalitarian regimes, inter alia Communist regimes\" and for\nThe Communist Party of Greece opposes the Prague Declaration and has criticized \"the new escalation of the anti-communist hysteria led by the EU council, the European Commission and the political staff of the bourgeois class in the European Parliament.\" The Communist Party of Britain opined that the Prague Declaration \"is a rehash of the persistent attempts by reactionary historians to equate Soviet Communism and Hitlerite Fascism, echoing the old slanders of British authors George Orwell and Robert Conquest.\"\n\nThe 2008 documentary film \"The Soviet Story\", commissioned by the Union for Europe of the Nations group in the European Parliament, published archival records which listed thousands of German Jews who were arrested in the Soviet Union by the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) from 1937 to 1941 and handed over to Gestapo or SS officials in Germany. These German Jews had originally sought asylum in the USSR. The documentary film accuses Stalin's regime of being an accomplice in Hitler's Holocaust by arresting these asylum seekers and sending them back to Germany.\n\nSince 2009, the European Union has officially commemorated the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism, proclaimed by the European Parliament in 2008 and endorsed by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2009, and officially known as the Black Ribbon Day in some countries (including Canada).\n\nThe former President of the European Parliament and Christian Democratic Union member, Hans-Gert Pöttering, argued that \"both totalitarian systems (Stalinism and Nazism) are comparable and terrible.\"\n\nIn some Eastern European countries the denial of both Nazi and Communist crimes has been explicitly outlawed, and Czech foreign minister Karel Schwarzenberg has argued that \"there is a fundamental concern here that totalitarian systems be measured by the same standard.\" However, the European Commission rejected calls for similar EU-wide legislation, due to the lack of consensus among member states.\n\nA statement adopted by Russia's legislature said that comparisons of Nazism and Stalinism are \"blasphemous towards all of the anti-fascist movement veterans, Holocaust victims, concentration camp prisoners and tens of millions of people ... who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the fight against the Nazis' anti-human racial theory.\"\n\nBritish journalist Seumas Milne posits that the impact of the post-Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, and therefore Communism is as monstrous as Nazism, \"has been to relativise the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7357", "title": "Complaint", "text": "Complaint\n\nIn legal terminology, a complaint is any formal legal document that sets out the facts and legal reasons (see: cause of action) that the filing party or parties (the plaintiff(s)) believes are sufficient to support a claim against the party or parties against whom the claim is brought (the defendant(s)) that entitles the plaintiff(s) to a remedy (either money damages or injunctive relief). For example, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) that govern civil litigation in United States courts provide that a civil action is commenced with the filing or service of a pleading called a complaint. Civil court rules in states that have incorporated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure use the same term for the same pleading. \n\nIn Civil Law, a “complaint” is the very first formal action taken to officially begin a lawsuit. This written document contains the allegations against the defense, the specific laws violated, the facts that led to the dispute, and any demands made by the plaintiff to restore justice.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be commenced by the filing of a complaint, also sometimes called a criminal complaint or felony complaint. Most criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority that promulgates criminal statutes and enforces the police power of the state with the goal of seeking criminal sanctions, such as the State (also sometimes called the People) or Crown (in Commonwealth realms). In the United States, the complaint is often associated with misdemeanor criminal charges presented by the prosecutor without the grand jury process. In most U.S. jurisdictions, the charging instrument presented to and authorized by a grand jury is referred to as an indictment.\n\nVirtually every U.S. state has some forms available on the web for most common complaints for lawyers and self-representing litigants; if a petitioner cannot find an appropriate form in their state, they often can modify a form from another state to fit his or her request. Several United States federal courts publish general guidelines for the petitioners and Civil Rights complaint forms.\n\nA complaint generally has the following structural elements:\n\nAfter the complaint has been filed with the court, it has to be properly served to the opposite parties, but usually petitioners are not allowed to serve the complaint personally. The court also can issue a summons - an official summary document which the plaintiff needs to have served together with the complaint. The defendants have limited time to respond, depending on the State or Federal rules. A defendant's failure to answer a complaint can result in a default judgment in favor of the petitioner.\n\nFor example, in United States federal courts, any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a summons and complaint in a civil case. The defendant must submit an answer within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint, or request a waiver, according to FRCP Rule 12. After the civil complaint has been served to the defendants, the plaintiff must, as soon as practicable initiate a conference between the parties to plan for the rest of the discovery process and then the parties should submit a proposed discovery plan to the judge within 14 days after the conference.\n\nIn many U.S. jurisdictions, a complaint submitted to a court must be accompanied by a Case Information Statement, which sets forth specific key information about the case and the lawyers representing the parties. This allows the judge to make determinations about which deadlines to set for different phases of the case, as it moves through the court system.\n\nThere are also freely accessible web search engines to assist parties in finding court decisions that can be cited in the complaint as an example or analogy to resolve similar questions of law. Google Scholar is the biggest database of full text state and federal courts decisions that can be accessed without charge. These web search engines often allow one to select specific state courts to search.\n\nFederal courts created the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system to obtain case and docket information from the United States district courts, United States courts of appeals, and United States bankruptcy courts. The system is managed by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts; it allows lawyers and self-represented clients to obtain documents entered in the case much faster than regular mail.\n\nIn addition to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, many of the U.S. district courts have developed their own requirements included in Local Rules for filing with the Court. Local Rules can set up a limit on the number of pages, establish deadlines for motions and responses, explain whether it is acceptable to combine a motion petition with a response, specify if a judge needs an additional copy of the documents (called \"judge’s copy\"), etc. Local Rules can define page layout elements like: margins, text font/size, distance between lines, mandatory footer text, page numbering, and provide directions on how the pages need to be bound together – i.e. acceptable fasteners, number and location of fastening holes, etc. If the filed motion does not comply with the Local Rules then the judge can choose to strike the motion completely, or order the party to re-file its motion, or grant a special exception to the Local Rules.\n\nAccording to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) , sensitive text like Social Security number, Taxpayer Identification Number, birthday, bank accounts and children’s names, should be redacted from the filings made with the court and accompanying exhibits, (however, exhibits normally do not need to be attached to the original complaint, but should be presented to Court after the discovery). The redacted text can be erased with black-out or white-out, and the page should have an indication that it was redacted - most often by stamping word \"redacted\" on the bottom. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court’s permission to file some exhibits completely under seal. A minor's name of the petitions should be replaced with initials.\n\nA person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the Court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction. Copies of both redacted and unredacted documents filed with court should be provided to the other parties in the case. Some courts also require that an additional electronic courtesy copy be emailed to the other parties.\n\nBefore filing the complaint, it is important for plaintiffs to remember that Federal courts can impose liability for the prevailing party's attorney fees to the losing party, if the judge considers the case frivolous or for purposes of harassment, even when the case was voluntarily dismissed. In the case of Fox v. Vice, the U.S. Supreme Court held that reasonable attorneys' fees could be awarded to the defendant under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988, but only for costs that the defendant would not have incurred \"but for the frivolous claims.\" Even when there is no actual trial or judgment, if there is only pre-trial motion practice such as motions to dismiss, attorney fee shifting still can be awarded under FRCP Rule 11 when the opposing party files a Motion for Sanctions and the court issue an order identifying the sanctioned conduct and the basis for the sanction. The losing party has a right to appeal any order for sanctions in the higher court. In the state courts, however, each party is generally responsible only for its own attorney fees, with certain exceptions.\n\n\n"}

This practice includes understanding the composition and agents of deterioration of photographic plates, as well as the preventive conservation and interventive conservation measures that can be taken to increase their longevity. \n\nThe term photographic plates refers to a type of photograph that consists of an image bound to a glass support. Glass plates emerged as a common support medium for photographic negatives in the mid-nineteenth century. In general, black-and-white photographic negatives are made up of fine silver particles, (or color dyes for color negatives), which are embedded in a thin layer called a binder. Combined with the image substance, these two elements make-up what is called the emulsion. This emulsion layer sits upon what is called the support, which can be paper, metal, film, or as in the case of photographic plates, glass. An important part of the photographic process, \"fixing,\" is used to wash the silver particles that are not part of the image, which then produces a stable negative image. This negative image can then be used over many years to produce paper positives. Glass plates as a form of support were popular in use between 1851 and the 1920s.\n\n\n\nPhotographic plates face certain challenges to their preservation. In order to protect against deterioration or damage, conservators seek to identify the agents that threaten the various materials that make-up photographic glass plates. The primary agents of deterioration include the following:\n\nRelative humidity (RH) and temperature are two of the most serious threats to photographic plates and can determine their longevity. As with other cultural collections, an overall high temperature in combination with high humidity can lead to mold growth as well as attract pests. Heat is also a danger to collections because it is an element that accelerates any type of chemical deterioration that occurs, specifically in photographic materials. \n\nPhotographic plates face significant structural and chemical challenges unique to their makeup - Fluctuations in RH can strain the adhesion of the gelatin to the glass plate as changes can cause the gelatin to expand and contract as well as cause emulsion to crack or separate along the edges. Also, on a gelatin dry plate, high humidity can cause mold to grow on the emulsion and cause the plates to stick together. Increasing the relative humidity can cause deterioration of other elements as well such as the silver, varnish, and glass support. Decreasing the RH will cause deterioration by leading to the flaking of the binder and dehydration of the glass.\n\nPhotographic plates, along with all photographic materials, are very sensitive to light. Extensive and ongoing exposure to light can cause significant deterioration that is irreversible. Sunlight is the most damaging type of light, but indoor lighting and any other UV lighting all pose a serious threat to photographic plates causing fading and yellowing. \n\nLight is especially threatening to color photographic materials since it accelerates the fading of the color dyes. It was not uncommon for photographic plates to be hand-painted in order to produce color images. Exposure to light of colored glass slides could deteriorate and lead to discoloration of the pigments.\n\nAir pollution can pose a threat to photographic plates through poor air quality and dirt that can damage the materials. This can include dust, gaseous pollution from an urban environment, and dirt particulate. Air pollution can cause fading of photographic materials as well as damage the surface of the image by causing an abrasion. Other sources of air pollution include \"photocopying machines, construction materials, paint fumes, cardboard, carpets, and janitorial supplies,\" as well as other types of outdated or obsolete media.\n\nThe glass composition of photographic plates can be a factor of deterioration. Due to poor quality or an inherent vice, \"sick glass\" can occur. Environmental conditions are usually linked to the increase or presence of this glass corrosion. The effect of \"sick glass\" can be weeping and crizzling which can be caused by excessive alkali present and a lack of stabilizers. Weeping involves droplets forming on the glass that appear as small crystals. This type of deterioration is especially threatening for cased photographs because the cover glass could be corroded and damage the photographic image underneath. Corrosion of the glass plate support can also damage the image layer by causing the lifting of the binder and varnish layers. \n\nThe other chemical components of glass plate negatives can also be threatening agents of deterioration. For instance, the silver image layer could possibly undergo oxidative deterioration which can lead to fading and discoloration. Additionally, the collodion binder itself is made up of cellulose nitrate which is known to be a flammable compound. While this is very dangerous as a film support, it is not thought to be as threatening in the binder. Most of these agents of deterioration are the result of poor chemical processing, but they are usually exacerbated by poor environmental and storage conditions.\n\nGlass plates are rather stable dimensionally, but they are also very fragile and brittle. Because glass is brittle, it is highly susceptible to breakage, cracks, and fractures. This can be caused by human error including dropping or bumping the glass plate, or it can be caused by failure of storage equipment, housing, shelves, etc. which may lead to an impact to the glass. \n\nTypes of breakage:\n\nCertain types of breakage and stress states affect the image layer and binder in different ways.\n\nEnvironmental controls are a crucial part of the preservation of photographic glass plates. Relative humidity (RH), temperature, and light play a large role in keeping the multiple materials in photographic glass plates maintained. The following regulatory measures are taken for their preservation:\n\n\nPhotographic glass plates are handled carefully to avoid physical or chemical deterioration and damage – the following aids in their preservation through proper handling: \n\n\nStorage and housing of photographic glass plates is an important part of their preservation. Museums and other cultural institutions take the following measures to ensure their glass plates are properly housed: \n\n\nBroken or cracked glass plates are stored in a special manner, separate from other photographic plates and in the following ways:\n\n\nMaintenance/housekeeping of photographic plates requires minimal intervention: \n\n\n\nBroken or cracked glass plates make up a large portion of those in need of conservation treatment. There are various actions taken in reassembling and restoring these plates using the following materials and methods: \n\nAdhesives: (There is no one ideal adhesive to be used)\n\nApplication:\n\n\nBacking material:\n\n\nRepair methods & techniques:\n\n\nThe Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre\n\nIdentification resources: \n\nConservation & restoration resources:\n\nConservation of Glass Plate Negatives at the Smithsonian\n\nCase Study: Repair of a Broken Glass Plate Negative\nThe Conservation of Glass Plates: Student Placement\n"}

FAST is developed as a part of WorldCat by the Online Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLC), with the goal of making subject cataloging less costly and easier to implement in online contexts. FAST headings separate topical data from non-topical data, such as information about a document's form, chronological coverage, or geographical coverage.\n\nUnlike LCSH, which are pre-coordinated, FAST headings are post-coordinated.\n\nOCLC has been developing FAST since 1998, and originally intended the system to describe Web resources in simple metadata schemata, particularly Dublin Core.\nFAST separates headings into eight distinct facets: topical, geographic, personal name, corporate name, form, chronological, title as subject, and meeting name. Each facet can be mapped to a specific Dublin Core element. For example, the geographic facet can be mapped to the \"coverage\" element in the basic Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, and to the \"coverage.geographic\" element in qualified Dublin Core.\n\nIn keeping with Dublin Core's simplicity, FAST headings are meant to be \"simple and easy to apply and to comprehend.\" To facilitate subject assignment, OCLC has developed a tool called \"assignFast\". This tool uses an autocomplete feature to assist catalogers with the details of FAST headings.\n\nOCLC has published FAST as linked data under an Open Data Commons Attribution (ODC-By) License.\n\nOrganisations using the FAST vocabulary include:\n\nAnalysis & Policy Observatory (APO)\n\nBritish Library\n\nHarvard University\n\nInformit\n\nNational Library of New Zealand\n\nThe FAST Policy and Outreach Committee (FPOC) was established in 2018. \n\nThe FAST authority file contains over 1,700,000 authority records.\n\nFAST's chronological periods have been critiqued as making little sense outside the context of full LCSH. An OCLC study showed that several libraries that had adopted FAST were impressed by its \"ease of use, simple syntax, [and] suitability for use by non-specialist staff.\" However, several libraries in the same study were discouraged by a lack of communication with OCLC.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1522196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1522196", "title": "Gorgeous George", "text": "Gorgeous George\n\nGeorge Raymond Wagner (March 24, 1915 – December 26, 1963) was an American professional wrestler best known by his ring name Gorgeous George. In the United States, during the First Golden Age of Professional Wrestling in the 1940s–1950s, Gorgeous George gained mainstream popularity and became one of the biggest stars of this period, gaining media attention for his outrageous character, which was described as flamboyant and charismatic. He was posthumously inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2002 and the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2010.\n\nWagner, of German-American heritage, was born March 24, 1915 in Butte, Nebraska. For a time, his family lived on a farm near the village of Phoenix in Holt County and probably in Seward County before they moved to Waterloo, Iowa and later Sioux City. When George was 7 years old, his family moved to Houston, Texas, where he associated with kids from a tough neighborhood. As a child, he trained at the local YMCA and often staged matches against his friends.\n\nIn 1929, he dropped out of Milby High School at 14, and worked odd jobs to help support his family. At this time, he competed at carnivals, where he could earn 35 cents for a win. By age 17, he was getting booked by the region's top promoter, Morris Siegel, and in 1938, he won his first title by defeating Buck Lipscomb for Northwest Middleweight crown. Moreover, on May 19, 1939, he captured the Pacific Coast Light Heavyweight Championship.\n\nAt 5 ft 9 in and 215 pounds (1.75 m and 98 kg), Wagner was not particularly physically imposing by professional wrestling standards, nor was he an exceptionally gifted athlete, although he was a gifted amateur wrestler. Nevertheless, he soon developed a reputation as a solid in-ring wrestler. In the late 1930s, he met Elizabeth \"Betty\" Hanson, whom he would eventually marry in an in-ring ceremony. When the wedding proved a good drawing card, the couple re-enacted it in arenas across the country (which thus enlightened Wagner to the potential entertainment value that was left untapped within the industry). Around this same time, \"Vanity Magazine\" published a feature article about a professional wrestler named 'Lord' Patrick Lansdowne, who entered the ring accompanied by two valets while wearing a velvet robe and doublet. Wagner was impressed with the bravado of such a character, but he believed that he could take it to a much greater extreme. What he needed was a new professional persona.\n\nLater, in Portland, Oregon, Betty (George's wife) told Dean Higinbotham, the nephew of Betty's sister, Evangeline \"Eva\", how George got the name Gorgeous George. In the early 1940s George had a wrestling match at the Portland Oregon Armory. As he walked down the aisle to the ring, there were two mature women on his right, two rows back from the ring. One of the women loudly exclaimed, \"Oh, isn't he gorgeous.\" That word \"gorgeous\" struck George and he immediately felt he had found his new professional persona. He would be \"Gorgeous George\". As Elsie Hanson, Betty's mother, was a skilled seamstress, George asked her to make him some resplendent capes that would accentuate his new persona. George wore those capes in all his future matches.\n\nSubsequently, George debuted his new \"glamour boy\" image on a 1941 card in Eugene, Oregon; and he quickly antagonized the fans with his exaggerated effeminate behavior when the ring announcer introduced him as \"Gorgeous George\". Such showmanship was unheard of for the time; and consequently, arena crowds grew in size as fans turned out to ridicule George (who relished the sudden attention).\n\nGorgeous George was soon recruited to Los Angeles by promoter Johnny Doyle. Known as the \"Human Orchid\", his persona was created in part by growing his hair long, dyeing it platinum blonde, and putting gold-plated bobby pins in it (which he called \"Georgie Pins\" and distributed to the audience). Furthermore, he transformed his ring entrance into a bona-fide spectacle that would often take up more time than his actual matches. He strolled nobly to the ring to the sounds of \"Pomp and Circumstance\", followed by his valet and a purple spotlight. Wearing an elegant robe sporting an array of sequins, Gorgeous George was always escorted down a personal red carpet by his ring valet \"Jeffries\", who would carry a silver mirror while spreading rose petals at his feet. While George removed his robe, Jeffries would spray the ring with disinfectant, ostensibly Chanel No. 5 perfume, which George referred to as \"Chanel #10\" (\"Why be half-safe?\" he was famous for saying) before he would start wrestling. Moreover, George required that his valets spray the referee's hands before the official was allowed to check him for any illegal objects, which thus prompted his now-famous outcry \"Get your filthy hands off me!\" Once the match finally began, he would cheat in every way he could. Gorgeous George was the industry's first true cowardly villain, and he would cheat at every opportunity, which infuriated the crowd. His credo was \"Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat!\" This flamboyant image and his showman's ability to work a crowd were so successful in the early days of television that he became the most famous wrestler of his time, drawing furious heel heat wherever he appeared.\n\nIt was with the advent of television, however, that George's character exploded into the biggest drawing card the industry had ever known. With the networks looking for cheap, effective programming to fill its time slots, pro wrestling's glorified action became a genuine hit with the viewing public, as it was the first program of any kind to draw a real profit. Consequently, it was Gorgeous George who brought the sport into the nation's living rooms, as his histrionics and melodramatic behavior made him a larger-than-life figure in American pop-culture. His first television appearance took place on November 11, 1947 (an event that was recently named among the top 100 televised acts of the 20th century by Entertainment Weekly) and he immediately became a national celebrity at the same level of Lucille Ball and Bob Hope (who personally donated hundreds of chic robes for George's collection) while changing the course of the industry forever. No longer was pro wrestling simply about the in-ring action, but George had created a new sense of theatrics and character performance that had not previously existed. Moreover, in a very real sense, it was Gorgeous George who single-handedly established television as a viable entertainment medium that could potentially reach millions of homes across the country. It is said that George was probably responsible for selling as many television receivers as Milton Berle.\n\nIn addition to his grandiose theatrics, Gorgeous George was an accomplished wrestler. While many may have considered him a mere gimmick wrestler, he was actually a very competent freestyle wrestler, having started learning the sport in amateur wrestling as a teenager, and he could handle himself quite well if it came to a legitimate contest. The great Lou Thesz, who would take the AWA title away from Wagner, and who was one of the best \"legit\" wrestlers ever in professional wrestling, displayed some disdain for the gimmick wrestlers. Nevertheless, he admitted that Wagner \"could wrestle pretty well\", but added that, \"he [Wagner] could never draw a fan until he became Gorgeous George.\"\nOn March 26, 1947, he defeated Enrique Torres to capture the Los Angeles Heavyweight Championship. Then on February 22, 1949, George was booked as the feature attraction at New York City's Madison Square Garden in what would be pro wrestling's first return to the building in 12 years. By the 1950s, Gorgeous George's star power was so huge that he was able to command 50% of the gate for his performances, which allowed him to earn over $100,000 a year, thus making him one of the highest paid athletes in the world. Moreover, on May 26, 1950, Gorgeous George defeated Don Eagle to claim the AWA World Heavyweight Championship (Boston version), which he held for several months. During this reign he was beaten by the National Wrestling Alliance World Champion Lou Thesz in a highly publicized bout in Chicago. However, perhaps Gorgeous George's most famous match was against his longtime rival Whipper Billy Watson on March 12, 1959, in which a beaten George had his treasured golden locks shaved bald before 20,000 delighted fans at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens and millions more on national television.\n\nIn one of his final matches, Gorgeous George later faced off against (and lost to) an up-and-coming Bruno Sammartino, though he would lose his precious hair again when he was defeated by the Destroyer in a hair vs. mask match at the Olympic Auditorium on November 7, 1962. This was his final match, as he was nearly 50 years old and suffering from the effects of alcoholism. In 2002, he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame (PWHF.org) by a committee of his peers. On March 27, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2010. His 97-year-old former wife, Betty Wagner accepted the honor on his behalf, answering questions and telling the story of how he became Gorgeous George.\n\nAs his wrestling career wound down, Wagner invested in a turkey ranch built in Beaumont, California, and the wrestler used his showman skills to promote his prized poultry at his wrestling matches and sport shows, popular during his heyday. He raised turkeys and owned a cocktail lounge in Van Nuys, California, which he named \"Gorgeous George's Ringside Restaurant\".\n\nWagner was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1962 and so his doctors ordered him to retire from wrestling. This, combined with financial troubles which stemmed from a recent divorce, worsened his health. He suffered a heart attack on December 24, 1963, and died two days later, at age 48. According to Lanny Poffo, Angelo Poffo, who credited Wagner for motivating his wrestling career, paid for his funeral. A plaque at his gravesite reads \"Love to our Daddy Gorgeous George\".\n\nMuhammad Ali and James Brown acknowledged that their own approach to flamboyant self-promotion was influenced by George. A 19 year old Ali met a 46 year old George at a Las Vegas radio station. During George's radio interview, the wrestler's promo caught the attention of the future heavyweight champion. If George lost to Classy Freddie Blassie, George exclaimed, \"I'll crawl across the ring and cut my hair off! But that's not gonna happen because I'm the greatest wrestler in the world!\" Ali, who later echoed that very promo when taunting opponent Sonny Liston, recalled, \"I saw 15,000 people comin' to see this man get beat. And his talking did it. I said, 'This is a gooood idea!'\" In the locker room afterward, the seasoned wrestler gave the future legend some invaluable advice: \"A lot of people will pay to see someone shut your mouth. So keep on bragging, keep on sassing and always be outrageous.\"\n\nIn September 2008, the first full-length biography of Gorgeous George was published by HarperEntertainment Press. The title of the 304 page book is \"Gorgeous George: The Outrageous Bad Boy Wrestler who Created American Pop Culture\" by John Capouya. In the 2005 book \"I Feel Good: A Memoir in a Life of Soul\", James Brown said he used many of Gorgeous George's antics to \"create the James Brown you see on stage\".\n\nBob Dylan said meeting George changed his life. In Dylan's book \"The Chronicles: Volume One\", Dylan recounts a story of meeting Gorgeous George in person. He wrote, \"He winked and seemed to mouth the phrase, 'You're making it come alive.' I never forgot it. It was all the recognition and encouragement I would need for years.\"\n\nThe 1951 Warner Brothers \"Merrie Melodies\" cartoon \"Bunny Hugged\" featured the one-shot character \"Ravishing Ronald\", modeled after Gorgeous George. The Bowery Boys also lampooned Gorgeous George (with Huntz Hall as a much-heralded wrestler) in the 1952 feature \"No Holds Barred\". Musical performers such as Liberace, Little Richard, Elton John, Prince and Morris Day show signs of the George meme.\n\nThe 1978 motion picture \"The One and Only\" starring Henry Winkler was loosely based on his career.\n\nThe Simpsons episode \"Gorgeous Grampa\" was partially based on Gorgeous George's career.\n\nGorgeous George appeared in one motion picture, \"Alias the Champ\", made in 1949.\n\nKredo, a Swiss DJ, named one of his Cells EP tracks 'Gorgeous George', as a tribute to the wrestler.\n\nHe was parodied in the 1951 Bugs Bunny cartoon ‘Bunny Hugged’ as ‘Ravishing Ronald’.\n\nWagner was married twice. First to Betty Hanson (1913–2011), whom he married in 1939 in Eugene, Oregon inside a wrestling ring. They adopted two children. In 1951, after divorcing Betty, he married Cherie Dupré (1927–2000). By this marriage, he had one biological son, Gary George. His son had one daughter, Amanda George who gave birth to three daughters, Wagner's only biological great-granddaughters. Cheri filed for divorce from George in April 1962. George also had a son whom he named Gorgeous George in 1946 by an extramarital relationship.\n\nHis grand-nephew Robert Kellum later wrestled as \"Gorgeous George III\" in the United States Wrestling Association. George's first wife Betty died on June 3, 2011 at the age of 98.\n\n\n\n"}

Some people believe that spirits discarded by their previous owners will haunt places associated with water. The unguided and lost spirit roams the area and feeds on anything available, including humans.\n\nSuperstitions arising among the locals tell of this evil spirit dwelling in watery places where it sometimes disguises itself as an old tree trunk, a beautiful lady, fish or other animals in order to lure people into its trap. When caught the human will be eaten or drowned.\n\nCurrently, deaths near watery areas are attributed to outbreaks of Leptospirosis, instead of Hantu Air.\n\nA ceremony called Semah Pantai was once popular among local older Malays, especially in the East Coast of Malaysia.

HRHD is an unofficial standard of encoding video, meaning that the video signal was ripped directly from a HDTV broadcast, then downsampled to approximately 960 × 540, and usually encoded with Xvid. While the horizontal resolution of 960 remains constant the vertical resolution can fluctuate up to 5% to provide clean cropping. It is sometimes erroneously referred to as \"Half\"-Resolution High-Definition.\n\nEncoding for a 40–55-minute HRHD TV show should be approximately 700 MB, the size of a compact disc. It contains the original AC3 sound, which is often 5.1 channels, instead of the re-encoded stereo MP3 stream found in 350MB releases.\n\nThe HRHD format began in late 2003 when the TV capture group FUA began distributing what they termed \"HRHDTV rips\" on the private FTP sites of The Scene.

The alleged violations include rape, extrajudicial killings, ethnic cleansing, misconduct and bombings of civilians.\n\nLuis Moreno Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, estimated that between 500 and 700 people were killed by Gaddafi's security forces in February 2011, before the rebels even took up arms. \"Shooting at protesters was systematic,\" Moreno-Ocampo stated, discussing the Libyan government's response to the initial anti-government demonstrations.\n\nThe Libyan government denied that they ordered killings of demonstrators in the early days of the uprising. They said that soldiers acted in self-defense as they were attacked by mobs.\n\nMoreno-Ocampo further stated that during the conflict, \"War crimes are apparently committed as a matter of policy\" by forces loyal to Gaddafi.\nThis is further supported by claims of Human Rights Watch, that 10 protesters, who had already agreed to lay down arms, were executed by a government paramilitary group in Bani Walid in May.\n\nIn June 2011, an investigation carried out by Amnesty International claimed that allegations of use of anti-aircraft guns against crowds lack evidence, noting that rebels at times appeared to have made false claims or manufactured evidence. The used cartridges after protesters were shot at \"came from Kalashnikovs or similar calibre weapons\". According to the Amnesty investigation, \"there is no proof of mass killing of civilians on the scale of Syria or Yemen\", adding that in Bengazi 100 to 110 people were killed, and in Baida 59 to 64 people were killed. Most of these were probably protesters, and some might have had weapons.\n\nHowever, in a later report from Amnesty International it was found that \"al-Gaddafi forces committed serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL), including war crimes, and gross human rights violations,which point to the commission of crimes against humanity. They deliberately killed and injured scores of unarmed protesters; subjected perceived opponents and critics to enforced disappearance and torture and other ill-\ntreatment; and arbitrarily detained scores of civilians. They launched indiscriminate attacks and attacks targeting civilians in their efforts to regain control of Misratah and territory in the east. They launched artillery, mortar and rocket attacks against residential areas. They used inherently indiscriminate weapons such as anti-personnel land mines and cluster bombs,including in residential areas.\"\n\nIn July 2011, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi had an interview with \"Russia Today\", where he denied the ICC's allegations that he or his father ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He contended that as he was not a member of the government or the military, he therefore had no authority to give such orders. According to Saif, he made recorded calls to General Abdul Fatah Younis (who later defected to the rebel forces) to request that force not be used against protesters, to which Younis responded that they were attacking a military site, where surprised guards fired in self-defense.\n\nA Libyan psychologist, Siham Sergewa, conducted a survey of refugees in Tunisia and Egypt to document the trauma of the civil war. Nearly 300 women were reported to have been raped. The real number could be much higher, considering the stigma attached to rape victims in Libyan society. Every single woman in the survey who admitted to being raped said they were raped by loyalist soldiers or militiamen.\n\nHowever, United Nations war-crimes expert M. Cherif Bassiouni, Human Rights Watch (HRW), Doctors Without Borders and Amnesty International say that they have found no evidence of systematic rape conducted by the Libyan government. Amnesty International's Donatella Rovera said that the Benghazi rebels had knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence, quoting one example of pristine boxes of Viagra that the rebels said were found inside a totally burned out tank belonging to Gaddafi's troops. This raised serious doubts about the claim that Gaddafi handed out Viagra to his soldiers to enable them to rape more efficiently.\n\nPhysicians for Human Rights (PHR) collected testimony of eyewitness who reported that pro-Gaddafi forces transformed an elementary school into a detention site where they raped women and girls as young as 14 years old. PHR also reports of honor killings that occurred in response to these rapes.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has confirmed claims of rebels, that pro-Gaddafi forces used land mines frequently during the conflict. It found them on at least six different locations in Libya, mostly on frontlines of the Gaddafi forces. Among these land mines are not only anti-tank mines, but also anti-personnel mines, which can permanently pose a threat to civilians.\nGaddafi forces have been accused by human-rights groups of shelling towns with heavy weapons, risking civilian lives indiscriminately. The most accusations refer to the siege of Misrata, accusing Gaddafi forces of targeting hospitals and civilian areas, also using internationally outlawed cluster bombs of Spanish production as ammunition, having risked the lives of civilians.\n\nA Human Rights Watch report documents the \"unlawful occupation and terror of hospital staff\" by pro-Government forces in Yafran in the western mountains, risking the lives of the patients and terrifying the staff contrary to international law.\n\nIn August 2011, Physicians for Human Rights released a report documenting severe violations of human rights and evidence of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity in Misrata. Findings included that Qaddafi forces used civilians as human shields, attacked ambulances bearing the Red Crescent, destroyed religious buildings, and intentionally starved civilians. In the same report, PHR gave evidence to violations of medical neutrality, such as attacks on medical facilities, medical transport, and medical workers.\n\nA group of 15 to 22 Libyan army soldiers captured in Derna were reportedly executed in the neighboring village of Martuba. According to a widely circulated story, the men were claimed to have been \"executed by their own officers for disobeying orders\".\n\nAnother group of 15 dark-skinned Libyan prisoners were publicly executed by hanging in front of the Bayda courthouse.\n\nOn 17 February, the Bayda hospital admitted two injured men, one of darker complexion and the other of olive complexion. The men were accused of fighting against the rebels. A hospital doctor claimed that the black man was murdered and hung by an angry mob that had gathered around the hospital. The other injured man was reportedly beaten, shot and returned to the emergency room.\n\nIn four towns in the western mountains captured in June by the opposition, HRW noticed looting of private property and beatings of alleged Gaddafi sympathizers by rebel forces. The National Transitional Council (NTC) then pledged to hold responsible the causers of the attacks and to prevent such abuses in the future.\n\nDuring the Battle of Sirte, the rebels killed many civilians, including men, women, and children, while there were also reports of the rebels harassing and stealing from the locals. According to one resident, \"The rebels are worse than rats. NATO is the same as Osama bin Laden.\" According to another local woman, \"We lived in democracy under Muammar Gaddafi, he was not a dictator. I lived in freedom, Libyan women had full human rights. It isn't that we need Muammar Gaddafi again, but we want to live just as we did before.\" A local elderly woman stated \"They are killing our children. Why are they doing this? For what? Life was good before!\"\n\nOn 9 August, the Libyan government claimed that 85 civilians were killed in NATO airstrikes on the village of Majer near Zliten. A NATO spokesman said that they were targeting four buildings in which nine vehicles were destroyed and that government claim \"was not corroborated by available factual information at the site\". The Libyan government declared three days of national mourning. Reporters were later taken to a hospital where they saw at least 30 dead bodies, including the bodies of at least two young children. The Libyan government claimed that the bodies of others killed in the airstrikes were taken to other hospitals. Neither of these claims were independently verified, although some media outlets came to the conclusion that it seemed more credible than usual that something tragic happened due to the presence of at least 14 bodies at one hospital, including an infant.\n\nRussia's U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said a council-mandated investigation of NATO involvement in the Libyan Civil War is essential \"given the fact that initially we were led to believe by NATO leaders there are zero civilian casualties of their bombing campaign.\" The U.S. and France called Russia's demand for an investigation \"a distraction\"\n\nSome journalists have accused human-rights organizations of falsifying claims, that Gaddafi was using mercenaries from other parts of Africa to attack protesters, Among the sources pointing to the existence of mercenaries are the claims by Gaddafi's former Chief of Protocol Nouri Al Mismari, who has claimed the presence of mercenaries from countries such as Chad, Niger, and Mali.\n\nThe Chadian government called on coalition forces to protect its citizens in rebel-held areas in Libya. It claimed that dozens had been accused and executed for allegedly being mercenaries in the pay of Gaddafi.\n\nA Turkish oil worker reported witnessing the murder of 70 to 80 Sudanese and Chadian guest workers with pruning shears and axes by Libyans who accused them of being Gaddafi mercenaries.\n\nHRW's Peter Bouckaert visited Bayda where 156 supposed mercenaries were being held captive. He reported that these men were actually black Libyans from Southern Libya. He argued that the support of the black southern Libyans for the Gaddafi regime was explainable, as Gaddafi fought to counter discrimination against them in Libyan society. In the same interview, Bouckaert also said that those 156 individuals were released by the rebels less than two weeks after being captured.\n\nKillings of unarmed migrant workers by insurgents have been described. On 18 April, a British reporter who had just arrived at Benghazi by sea from Misrata described the sufferings of large numbers of migrant workers trapped in Misrata in a broadcast on BBC Radio 4. After mentioning casualties during government forces attack he said about the migrant workers that \"…some have also died in clashes with the, err, rebel fighters. They were protesting about the conditions, demanding that they should be repatriated and on a couple of occasions \"this has led to the rebels opening fire and, err, people dying\".\"\n"}
{"id": "439244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439244", "title": "Incubus", "text": "Incubus\n\nAn incubus is a demon in male form who, according to mythological and legendary traditions, lies upon sleeping women\nin order to engage in sexual activity with them. Its female counterpart is a succubus. Salacious tales of incubi and succubi have been told for many centuries in traditional societies. Some traditions hold that repeated sexual activity with an incubus or succubus may result in the deterioration of health, mental state, or even death.\n\nThe word \"incubus\" is derived from Late Latin \"incubo\" \"a nightmare induced by such a demon\" from \"incubare\" \"to lie upon.\" One of the earliest mentions of an incubus comes from Mesopotamia on the Sumerian King List, ca. 2400 BC, where the hero Gilgamesh's father is listed as Lilu. It is said that Lilu disturbs and seduces women in their sleep, while Lilitu, a female demon, appears to men in their erotic dreams. Two other corresponding demons appear as well: Ardat lili, who visits men by night and begets ghostly children from them, and Irdu lili, who is known as a male counterpart to Ardat lili and visits women by night and begets from them. These demons were originally storm demons, but they eventually became regarded as night demons because of mistaken etymology. Written later but described as happening before the Sumerian King List was completed is the mention of the Nephilim: Christian tradition attributes the completion of the Biblical book of Genesis to the 5th century BC.\n\nIncubi were thought to be demons who had sexual relations with women, sometimes producing a child by the woman. Succubi, by contrast, were demons thought to have intercourse with men.\nDebate about these demons began early in the Christian tradition. St. Augustine touched on the topic in \"De Civitate Dei\" (\"The City of God\"); there were too many alleged attacks by incubi to deny them. He stated, \"There is also a very general rumor. Many have verified it by their own experience and trustworthy persons have corroborated the experience others told, that sylvans and fauns, commonly called incubi, have often made wicked assaults upon women.\" Questions about the reproductive capabilities of the demons continued. Eight hundred years later, Thomas Aquinas lent himself to the ongoing discussion, stating, \"Still, if some are occasionally begotten from demons, it is not from the seed of such demons, nor from their assumed bodies, but from the seed of men, taken for the purpose; as when the demon assumes first the form of a woman, and afterwards of a man; just so they take the seed of other things for other generating purposes.\" This view was also shared by King James and in his dissertation titled Dæmonologie he refutes the possibility for angelic entities to reproduce and instead offered a suggestion that a devil would carry out two methods of impregnating women: the first, to steal the sperm out of a dead man and deliver it into a woman. If a demon could extract the semen quickly, the transportation of the substance could not be instantly transported to a female host, causing it to go cold. This explains his view that Succubae and Incubi were the same demonic entity only to be described differently based on the sexes being conversed with. Being abused in such a way caused women at nunneries to be burned if they were found pregnant. The second method was the idea that a dead body could be possessed by a devil, causing it to rise and have sexual relations with others. This is similar to depictions of revenants or vampires and a spirit taking deceased corpse to cause some mischief. It became generally accepted that incubi and succubi were the same demon, able to switch between male and female forms. A succubus would be able to sleep with a man and collect his sperm, and then transform into an incubus and use that seed on women. Even though sperm and egg came from humans originally, the spirits' offspring were often thought of as supernatural.\n\nSome sources indicate that it may be identified by its unnaturally large or cold penis. Though many tales claim that the incubus is bisexual, others indicate that it is strictly heterosexual and finds attacking a male victim either unpleasant or detrimental.\n\nIncubi are sometimes said to be able to conceive children. The half-human offspring of such a union is sometimes referred to as a cambion. An incubus may pursue sexual relations with a woman in order to father a child, as in the legend of Merlin.\n\nAccording to the \"Malleus Maleficarum\", exorcism is one of the five ways to overcome the attacks of incubi, the others being Sacramental Confession, the Sign of the Cross (or recital of the Angelic Salutation), moving the afflicted to another location, and by excommunication of the attacking entity, \"which is perhaps the same as exorcism.\" On the other hand, the Franciscan friar Ludovico Maria Sinistrari stated that incubi \"do not obey exorcists, have no dread of exorcisms, show no reverence for holy things, at the approach of which they are not in the least overawed.\"\n\nThere are a number of variations on the incubus theme around the world. The alp of Teutonic or German folklore is one of the better known. In Zanzibar, Popo Bawa primarily attacks men and generally behind closed doors. \"The Trauco\", according to the traditional mythology of the Chiloé Province of Chile, is a hideous deformed dwarf who lulls nubile young women and seduces them. The Trauco is said to be responsible for unwanted pregnancies, especially in unmarried women. Perhaps another variation of this conception is the \"Tintín\" in Ecuador, a dwarf who is fond of abundant haired women and seduces them at night by playing the guitar outside their windows — a myth that researchers believe was created during the Colonial period of time to explain pregnancies in women who never left their houses without a chaperone, very likely covering incest or sexual abuse by one of the family's friends. In Hungary, a \"lidérc\" can be a Satanic lover that flies at night and appears as a fiery light (an \"ignis fatuus\" or will o' the wisp) or, in its more benign form as a featherless chicken.\n\nIn Brazil and the rainforests of the Amazon Basin, the Amazon River Dolphin (or \"boto\") is believed to be a combination of siren and incubus that shape-shifts into a very charming and handsome man who seduces young women and takes them into the river. It is said to be responsible for disappearances and unwanted pregnancies. According to legend, a boto always wears a hat to disguise the breathing hole at the top of its head while in human form, metamorphosing back into a dolphin during the day.\n\nThe Southern African incubus demon is the Tokolosh. Chaste women place their beds upon bricks to deter the rather short fellows from attaining their sleeping forms. They also share the hole in the head detail and water dwelling habits of the Boto.\n\nIn Swedish folklore, there is the mara or mare, a spirit or goblin that rides on the chests of humans while they sleep, giving them bad dreams (or \"nightmares\"). Belief in the mare goes back to the Norse Ynglinga saga from the 13th century, but the belief is probably even older. The mare was likely inspired by sleep paralysis.\n\nIn Assam, a north-eastern province of India it is mostly known as \"pori\" (Assamese: পৰী, meaning \"angel\"). According to the mythology, Pori comes to a man at night in his dreams and seduces him. Gradually the victim's health deteriorates and in some cases develops suicidal tendencies.\n\nIn Turkish culture, incubus is known as Karabasan. It is an evil being that descends upon some sleepers at night. These beings are thought to be spirits or jinns. It can be seen or heard in the nightmare and a heavy weight is felt on the chest. Yet, people cannot wake up from that state. Some of the causes are sleeping without adequately covering the body (especially women) and eating in bed.\n\nVictims may have been experiencing waking dreams or sleep paralysis. The phenomenon of sleep paralysis is well-established. During the first phase of sleep (also known as REM sleep), motor centers in the brain are inhibited, producing paralysis. The reason for this is ultimately unknown but the most common explanation is that this prevents one from acting out one's dreams. Malfunctions of this process can either result in somnambulism (sleepwalking) or, conversely, sleep paralysis—where one remains partially or wholly paralysed for a short time after waking.\n\nAdditional to sleep paralysis is hypnagogia. In a near-dream state, it is common to experience auditory and visual hallucinations. Mostly these are forgotten upon fully waking or soon afterwards, in the same manner as dreams. However, most people remember the phenomenon of hearing music or seeing things in near-sleep states at some point in their lives. Typical examples include a feeling of being crushed or suffocated, electric \"tingles\" or \"vibrations\", imagined speech and other noises, the imagined presence of a visible or invisible entity, and sometimes intense emotions of fear or euphoria and orgasmic feelings. These often appear quite real and vivid; especially auditory hallucinations of music which can be quite loud, indistinguishable from music being played in the same room. Humanoid and animal figures, often shadowy or blurry, are often present in hypnagogic hallucinations, more so than other hallucinogenic states. This may be a relic of an ancient instinct to detect predatory animals.\n\nThe combination of sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucination could easily cause someone to believe that a \"demon was holding them down\". Nocturnal arousal etc. could be explained away by creatures causing otherwise guilt-producing behavior. Add to this the common phenomena of nocturnal arousal and nocturnal emission, and all the elements required to believe in an incubus are present.\n\nOn the other hand, some victims of incubi could well have been the victims of real sexual assault. Rapists may have attributed the rapes of sleeping women to demons in order to escape punishment. A friend or relative is at the top of the list in such cases and would be kept secret by the intervention of \"spirits\".\n\n \n\n<--!male equivalent of succubus-->"}

Originally a sky spirit, her compassion for human suffering brought her to earth to share our fate.\n\nLaumės are the very oldest goddesses of Lithuanian mythology. The image of these goddesses may have formed during the historical Mesolithic period, just after the Ice Age. \nLaumės could appear in the form of animals, as mares or as female goats, bears and dogs. Later, Laumės had an anthropomorphic appearance: they usually had birds’ claws for feet and appeared as women with the head or lower body of a female goat. Other forms included half-human/half dog or half mare, similar to centaurs. Like cyclops, Laumės often had only one eye. They also had large breasts with stone nipples; pieces of belemnitida found on ground were called \"Laumės nipples.\"\n\nLaumės were dangerous, especially to men. They could tickle or tweak them to death and then eat their bodies, and in this way they were similar to Lamia of Greek mythology. The Lithuanian myth also claimed Laumės kept huge cows which could be milked by all people. However, after very cold weathers, the cows died; pieces of belemnitida were considered to be the remains of their udders. Laumės were afraid of tools made from iron.\n\nLaumės can be considered as atmospheric goddesses. It is said that Laumė was a beautiful goddess, who lived in clouds and had a diamond throne. Some myths claimed Laumė was a bride of thunder god Perkūnas; however, they did not marry because Laumė fell in love with the Moon, who was considered a male god in Lithuania. In other stories the bride was stolen by the devil Velnias, named Tuolius. That's why Laumė liked moonshine. In other myth, the bride of Perkūnas was a Laumė called Vaiva. The rainbow was called the ribbon of Vaiva. Despite her marriage she had a beloved singer named Straublys. Straublys had stolen the ribbon of Vaiva. During the rain, Straublys stretches the ribbon of Vaiva across the sky, while Perkūnas is angry and shouts in thunder. It was believed it is the rainbow that cause the rain, while Lithuanian shepherds had a prayer or curse by which the rainbow had to turn to pieces and make the rain go away. The other myth claimed Laumė fell in love with a beautiful young man down to earth. They both had a son named Meilius (name derived from word 'Meilė' - love). Laumė descended to sky to feed her son with her breasts from time to time. However, the highest God found out about the son of sacrilegious love, smashed him into highest place of the sky and gave him a place between stars. After that he cut Laumės breasts, and so, stone pieces of it can be found on Earth.\n\nLaumės descended from sky to Earth. They lived near by lakes, abandoned bath-houses, in islands of lakes or dense forests. Lots of names of water pools in Lithuania are named after word Laumė. Laumės liked to gather near rivers, lakes, swamps, in meadows, there dew fell in night in New Moon or Full Moon. They danced and enjoyed themselves, leaving circles (like Fairy Ring) in the grass. Usually, Laumės were most powerful at Friday of New Moon, at the most rainy days of month in Lithuania. Laumės could cause hail, storm or rain by singing, dancing or by curses. Laumės song was traditionally performed during weddings up until the 19th century. The song was performed by girls dancing in circle, with one in the middle. The dance and song was also said to cause rain.\n\nLater on, Laumės were depicted as very beautiful women, who appeared both naked or wearing a very fine clothing. The Rainbow was often called a ribbon lost by Laumės. What's how they were associated with weaving. Laumės usually appeared in groups of three. They were able to do women’s work perfectly, as are especially skilled in weaving and spinning. They love children, respect industriousness and help those in need. They punish those who ridicule them, and those who are lazy. Following are two example folk tales featuring Laumės:\n\nA woman was harvesting a flower bed and had taken her child with her. She was so busy with her work that the child slept the day through, and she left the little one behind.\n\nThe woman went home at the end of the day to milk the cows and make dinner. She served her husband, who asked her \"Where’s my son?\" With terror she whispered, \"I have forgotten him!\" She ran as fast as she could to the place in which she left her son, hearing a Laumé speak: \"Čiūčia liūlia, forgotten child.\" The mother, from the distance, asked the Laume for her child back. The fairie said, \"Come, come, dear woman, take your child, we have done nothing to him. We know that you work very hard, at many jobs, and that you didn’t want to leave your child behind.\"\n\nThe fairies then went on to shower the babe with much treasure, enough gifts to raise several children upon. The mother went home with her precious baby and with her gifts; she was greeted with great joy.\n\nAnother woman, hearing of her good fortune, was taken over by jealousy. She took to thinking, \"I shall do the same as her, and also be showered in gifts.\" The next evening, at dusk, she took her child, left him in the fields and went home. She ate dinner, thoughtlessly, before pausing to think of her child—and the treasure.\n\nWhen she approached the field, she heard the fairies, \"Čiūčia liūlia, you left your child in greed.\" And the child screamed with such great pain, for he was pinched and tortured mercilessly. They continued their torture until the mother came. The fairies tossed the child at her feet. The babe was dead.\n\nA Laumė would come to a window and would yell, \"Hundreds born, hundreds died, what of his fate?\" Another would answer back, \"Birth at night, death at night.\" And again they would yell and moan at the window. From within another would answer, \"This nightly birth is a big work smarter not harder, to live well whole life long.\" Again, yelling at the window, \"Hundreds born, hundreds dead, what of his fate?” Another answer: \"Morning time born will be a strong worker\". And again, after some time, begins the same questioning. The answer was \"Noontime born is a very happy child, full of bubbles and envy for what is not strictly in accordance with wealth.\"\n\nIn Latvian mythology Lauma is an assistant at birth, assuring the health and welfare of both mother and child. If the mother does not survive, or gives the child up, she takes on the role of spiritual foster mother for the child. She spins the cloth of life for the child, but weeps at the fate of some. The fact that the cloth can, to a degree, weave itself, indicates a higher power than Lauma.\n\nOver the years, her image has gradually degraded. Accused of baby-snatching by disrespectful husbands (since she is unable to bear children of her own), her looks and sweetness were lost, turning her into an evil old hag. She weeps at her destined fate, hoping for the day when she will return to her former beautiful self.\n"}

His most famous appearance was in a six-man match at WrestleMania III for the World Wrestling Federation.\n\nLionel Giroux began his wrestling career in 1950, at the age of fifteen, and then began to wrestle for promoters in Quebec. He, along with Sky Low Low, became two of the most famous midget wrestlers in wrestling who had enough drawing power to command a large portion of the live gate for wrestling events. Giroux helped to create the comedy matches that have since become a trademark for midget wrestling in Canada and the United States. In 1973, Giroux won the Pro Wrestling Illustrated Midget Wrestler of the Year award.\n\nHis last in-ring appearance was at WrestleMania III in the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan in 1987, at the age of 52. Giroux, wrestling as Little Beaver, teamed with Hillbilly Jim and fellow midget wrestler the Haiti Kid, defeating King Kong Bundy and his midget tag-team partners Little Tokyo and Lord Littlebrook, after Bundy was disqualified for attacking Little Beaver. During the match, Giroux suffered a back injury at the hands of Bundy after he was bodyslammed and had an elbow dropped on him by the Bundy, which forced him to retire from professional wrestling (through the match Beaver had \"annoyed\" Bundy including elbowing him in the stomach, delivering a drop kick that had literally no effect, and slapping him with his Moccasin which Bundy claimed \"Stung like a son-of-a-bitch\"). In a 1998 interview Bundy said he hoped that he wasn't responsible for Giroux's early death, saying he wouldn't want that on his conscience.\n\nA few months after Wrestlemania III, during a match at the Boston Garden that aired later on WWF Prime Time Wrestling, Giroux (again as Little Beaver) was in Hillbilly Jim's corner for a match against the One Man Gang. In a comical match eventually won by Hillbilly via a countout, Beaver got involved on several occasions, including antagonizing Gang's manager, Slick, throughout the match and hitting the back of Gang's head with a broom after the match was finished. The Gang finally caught Little Beaver in the ring and after delivering a blow that sent him sprawling, he followed Slick's orders to hit Beaver with his 747 Splash.\n\nGiroux died on December 4, 1995 of emphysema.

However, until recently those same local authorities have not held a unified and consistent list of addresses within their areas. This has led to various services within individual local authorities maintaining separate and incompatible address databases.\n\nIn recent years the central government of the UK has required local authorities to modernise their processes to take advantage of new technologies and provide better linked up services to their residents and businesses. One of the key ways to achieve this goal has been to develop one address resource for their entire local authority area. This has ultimately meant that a resident may notify a council of their change of address at one place without having to repeat the process throughout a number of service areas within an authority.\n\nAs part of this process the National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG) was created. This is a central repository or “hub” for all LLPGs and coordinates the many LLPGs created by local authorities. It also enforces the compliance of all LLPGs with the national standard for the representation of address information, British Standard 7666 (BS7666).\n\nLargely through pressure from the central UK government for a consistent address resource the NLPG has become UK’s definitive address infrastructure. However, the development of the NLPG has been held back by arguments between local authorities and the national mapping agency, Ordnance Survey, who are required to act as a trading entity. This has led to the NLPG being unable to compel local authorities to maintain their LLPGs as well as protracted negotiations regarding issues of ownership of address data.\n\nIn May 2005 local authorities in the UK signed an agreement (Mapping Services Agreement) with suppliers of geographic data, which included Ordnance Survey and the managers of the NLPG. This solved the issues surrounding ownership of address data and contained many restrictions on the use of LLPGs by local authorities as well as compulsions upn local authorities to maintain their LLPGs.\n\nHowever, simultaneously, Ordnance Survey published a proposal to develop an alternative address infrastructure called the National Spatial Address Infrastructure (NSAI). This involved Ordnance Survey taking ownership of the NLPG and then selling it back to the same local authorities that had created the LLPGs that make up the NLPG. This provoked another round of arguments between Ordnance Survey and local authorities. The NSAI has now been abandoned by Ordnance Survey.\n\nOn 3 December 2010, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government announced the formation of GeoPlace to provide a freely-available national address gazetteer. This is a joint venture between the Local Government Association and Ordnance Survey. The venture underwent a process of approval by the Office of Fair Trading, which passed a judgement allowing the venture on 15 February 2011.\n\nFollowing the setting up of GeoPlace, NLPG data has been brought together with Ordnance Survey, Valuation Office Agency and Royal Mail data into the National Address Gazetteer infrastructure. The National Address Gazetteer infrastructure is the single source from which the AddressBase products from Ordnance Survey are developed. Through agreement between Ordnance Survey and Scotland’s Improvement Service, working on behalf of Scottish Local Government, the National Address Gazetteer includes DT\n\n"}

The guide describes the fictional country Molvanîa, a Soviet state, a nation described as \"the birthplace of the whooping cough\" and \"owner of Europe's oldest nuclear reactor\". It was created by Australians Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro and Rob Sitch (locally known for \"The D-Generation\" and \"The Panel\" in Australia). The book has been criticized for promoting racial stereotypes.\n\nThe book became a surprise success after its initial publication in Australia, sparking a bidding war for the international publication rights. Qantas has even run the half-hour video segment produced in association with the book on its international flights.\n\nThe Republic of Molvanîa is a composite of many of the worst stereotypes and clichés about Soviet states. The exact location of Molvanîa is never specified; it is said to border Germany, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, and Romania. The shape of the country with its divisions strongly suggests Moldova, and the name has similarities (as has the location description by the authors as \"somewhere between Romania and downwind from Chernobyl\"); it can also represent a composite country consisting of parts of Hungary, Czech Republic, Croatia, Serbia, Slovakia, Austria, and perhaps Poland). The book mentions Bulgarians, Hungarians, and perhaps Moldovans (ethnic Romanians) as its inhabitants: \"The Molvanian population is made up of three major ethnic groups: the Bulgs (68%) who live predominantly in the centre and south, the Hungars (29%) who inhabit the northern cities, and the Molvs (3%) who can be found mainly in prison.\"\n\nThe book describes the nation as having been a desolate wasteland for much of its history, similar to Russia since the 12th century, torn by civil war and ethnic unrest. Eventually Molvanîa's various warring factions were united as a single kingdom, ruled by a series of cruel despotic kings. In the late 19th century the monarchy was overthrown, but the royal family remained popular in exile. During World War II the country was allied with Nazi Germany, and then afterwards was occupied by the Soviet Union, who set up a Communist puppet government. After the fall of European Communism in the 1990s, the country became a dictatorship run by a corrupt government with heavy ties to the Mafia.\n\nMolvanîa is described as a very poor and rural country, heavily polluted and geographically barren. The infrastructure is terrible, with necessities such as electricity, clean water, and indoor plumbing being rare finds, largely due to bureaucratic incompetence. Though the travel guide tries to suggest otherwise, there is little to do in the country, the hotels are tiny, filthy and dilapidated, the ethnic cuisine disgusting, and the \"tourist attractions\" boring and overpriced.\n\nThe Molvanîan people are portrayed as being generally rude, dirty, and at times slightly psychotic, with numerous bizarre and illogical beliefs and traditions. The country's patron saint is Fyodor.\n\nThe fictional Molvanîan language is said to be so complicated that it takes an average of 16 years to learn. Not only is the tone in which one speaks important to the meaning, but also the pitch. It is a gendered language, with different articles being used depending on whether a noun is masculine, feminine, neutral, or a type of cheese. There are language schools for tourists to attend, which are described by the book as a \"waste of time.\"\n\nThe flag of Molvanîa is called the \"Trikolor\" despite the fact it only contains two colours, red and yellow. During the Soviet occupation, the flag had a yellow hammer and sickle in the top left corner. After the fall of Communism, Molvanîa became one of the few ex-soviet states to retain the hammer and sickle but added a trowel into the symbol.\n\nThe country's national anthem can be heard on the website Molvania.com, which sounds more like a funeral march than a patriotic tune. Its lyrics are largely Anti-Gypsy, yet when anyone leaves the country the border security gives citizens and tourist the Gypsy Curse and it rubs in the fact the country is a Failed State.\n\nThe book was criticized by the United Kingdom's former Minister for Europe Keith Vaz, who accused it of exploiting prejudice.\n\nHe said the book was a little \"cheeky\" because \"it does reflect some of the prejudices which are taking root [in Europe]. He [Mr Gleisner] does try and show exactly where we are lacking in our knowledge, the sad thing is, some people might actually believe that this country exists.\"\n\nSubsequent travel guide parodies published examine Southeast Asian nation \"Phaic Tăn\" (published in 2004) and \"San Sombrèro\" in Latin America (published in 2006).\n\n\n"}

Wide glazed surfaces allow the viewer to admire the Ara Pacis with uniform lighting conditions.\n\nThe white colour is the trademark of Richard Meier, while the travertine plates decorating part of the building are a consequence of in-progress changes (aluminum surfaces were initially planned), after a design review following controversies with some nostalgia for the previous pavilion that was built in 1938 by the architect Vittorio Ballio Morpurgo.\n\nThe challenging design of Meier wants to assert itself in the very hearth of the town, becoming a nerve and transit centre. The complex was intended to include a crosswalk with an underpass linking the museum to the Tiber river; presently the underpass design seems to have been abandoned completely.\n\nThe building, designed by architect Richard Meier, was inaugurated and opened to the public after seven years of works, on April 21, 2006 (the anniversary of the traditional date of the foundation of Rome).\n\nDuring the night of May 31 2009, unknown persons defaced the white outer wall with green and red paint and placed a toilet bowl at the foot of the wall.\n\nOn December 12, 2009, a group of activists of Earth First!, during the Copenhagen Summit, colored the water of the fountain green and affixed on the side facing Via Tomacelli a banner saying \"Earth First! Act Now\". The officers and the employees of the museum intervened immediately, removing the banner and emptying the fountain.\n\nThe building has attracted conflicting opinions. The New York Times judged it a flop, while the famous art critic and polemicist Vittorio Sgarbi called it, \"A Texas gas station in the very earth of one of the most important urban centres in the world\", and the first step towards an \"internationalisation\" of the city of Rome.\nNonetheless, opinion was not unanimous at all and, for instance, Achille Bonito Oliva praised Meier's design.\n\nIn November 2013 a faulty roof allowed water to leak into the building during heavy rain. Staff members had to use buckets to remove water from the top of the altar.\n\nDuring one of his first declarations after being elected Mayor of Rome (April 2008), Gianni Alemanno announced his intention to remove Meier's building, on the grounds that the Roman right wing had always disapproved. However, Alemanno himself later pointed out that the removal was not a priority of his administration.\n\n\n"}

The \"sons of God\" have been interpreted as fallen angels in some traditional Jewish explanations.\n\nAccording to Numbers 13:33, they later inhabited Canaan at the time of the Israelite conquest of Canaan.\n\nThe Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon (1908) gives the meaning of nephilim as \"giants\", and holds that proposed etymologies of the word are \"all very precarious\". Many suggested interpretations are based on the assumption that the word is a derivative of Hebrew verbal root () \"fall\". Robert Baker Girdlestone argued in 1871 the word comes from the Hiphil causative stem, implying that the nephilim are to be perceived as \"those that cause others to fall down\". Ronald Hendel states that it is a passive form: \"ones who have fallen\", grammatically analogous to \"one who is appointed\" (i.e., overseer), \"one who is bound\" (i.e., prisoner), etc.\n\nThe majority of ancient biblical versions—including the Septuagint, Theodotion, Latin Vulgate, Samaritan Targum, Targum Onkelos, and Targum Neofiti—interpret the word to mean \"giants\". Symmachus translates it as \"the violent ones\" and Aquila's translation has been interpreted to mean either \"the fallen ones\" or \"the ones falling [upon their enemies]\".\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible there are three interconnected passages referencing the \"nephilim\". Two of them come from the Pentateuch and the first occurrence is in Genesis 6:1–4, immediately before the account of Noah's Ark. Genesis 6:4 reads as follows:The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown. Where the Jewish Publication Society translation simply transliterated the Hebrew \"nephilim\" as \"Nephilim\", the King James Version translated the term as \"giants\".\n\nThe nature of the Nephilim is complicated by the ambiguity of Genesis 6:4, which leaves it unclear whether they are the \"\"sons of God\" or their offspring who are the \"mighty men of old, men of renown\". Richard Hess takes it to mean that the Nephilim are the offspring, as does P.W. Coxon.\n\nThe second is Numbers 13:32-33, where ten of the Twelve Spies report that they have seen fearsome giants in Canaan:And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.\n\nOutside the Pentateuch there is one more passage indirectly referencing \"nephilim\" and this is Ezekiel 32:17–32. Of special significance is Ezekiel 32:27, which contains a phrase of disputed meaning. With the traditional vowels added to the text in the medieval period, the phrase is read \"gibborim nophlim\" (\"fallen warriors\" or \"fallen Gibborim\"), although some scholars read the phrase as \"gibborim nephilim\" (\"Nephilim warriors\" or \"warriors, Nephilim\"). According to Ronald S. Hendel, the phrase should be interpreted as \"warriors, the Nephilim\" in a reference to Genesis 6:4. The verse as understood by Hendel readsThey lie with the warriors, the Nephilim of old, who descended to Sheol with their weapons of war. They placed their swords beneath their heads and their shields upon their bones, for the terror of the warriors was upon the land of the living. Brian R. Doak, on the other hand, proposes to read the term as the Hebrew verb \"fallen\"\" (\"nophlim\"), not a use of the specific term \"Nephilim\", but still according to Doak a clear reference to the Nephilim tradition as found in Genesis.\n\nMost of the contemporary English translations of Genesis 6:1-4 and Numbers 13:33 render the Heb. \"nefilim\" as \"giants\". This tendency in turn stems from the fact that one of the earliest translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Septuagint, composed in III/II century BCE, renders the said word as \"gigantes\". The choice made by the Greek translators has been later adopted into the Latin translation, the Vulgate, compiled in IV/V century CE, which uses the transcription of the Greek term rather than the literal translation of the Heb. \"nefilim\". From there, the tradition of the giant progeny of the sons of God and the daughters of men spread to later medieval translations of the Bible.\n\nThe decision of the Greek translators to render the Heb. \"nefilim\" as Gr. \"gigantes\" is a separate matter. The Heb. \"nefilim\" means literally \"the fallen ones\" and the strict translation into Greek would be \"peptokotes\", which in fact appears in the Septuagint of Ezekiel 32:22-27. It seems then that the authors of Septuagint wished not only to simply translate the foreign term into Greek, but also to employ a term which would be intelligible and meaningful for their Hellenistic audiences. Given the complex of meaning of the \"nefilim\" which emerged from the three interconnected biblical passages (human-divine hybrids in Genesis 6, autochthonous people in Numbers 13 and ancient warriors trapped in the underworld in Ezekiel 32), the Greek translators recognized some similarities. First and foremost, both \"nefilim\" and \"gigantes\" were liminal figures resulting from the union of the opposite orders and as such retained the unclear status between the human and divine. Similarly, dim was their moral designation and the sources witnessed to both awe and fascination with which these figures must have been looked upon. Secondly, both were presented as impersonating chaotic qualities and posing some serious danger to gods and humans. They appeared either in the prehistoric or early historical context, but in both cases they preceded the ordering of the cosmos. Lastly, both \"gigantes\" and \"nefilim\" were clearly connected with underworld and were said to have originated from earth and as well end up closed therein.\n\nAll early sources refer to the \"sons of heaven\" as angels. From the third century BCE onwards, references are found in the Enochic literature, the Dead Sea Scrolls (the Genesis Apocryphon, the Damascus Document, 4Q180), Jubilees, the Testament of Reuben, 2 Baruch, Josephus, and the book of Jude (compare with 2 Peter 2). For example: 1 Enoch 7:2 \"And when the angels, (3) the sons of heaven, beheld them, they became enamoured of them, saying to each other, Come, let us select for ourselves wives from the progeny of men, and let us beget children.\" Some Christian apologists, such as Tertullian and especially Lactantius, shared this opinion.\n\nThe earliest statement in a secondary commentary explicitly interpreting this to mean that angelic beings mated with humans can be traced to the rabbinical \"Targum Pseudo-Jonathan\" and it has since become especially commonplace in modern Christian commentaries. This line of interpretation finds additional support in the text of Genesis 6:4, which juxtaposes the sons of God (male gender, divine nature) with the daughters of men (female gender, human nature). From this parallelism it could be inferred that the sons of God are understood as some superhuman beings.\n\nThe \"New American Bible\" commentary draws a parallel to the Epistle of Jude and the statements set forth in Genesis, suggesting that the Epistle refers implicitly to the paternity of Nephilim as heavenly beings who came to earth and had sexual intercourse with women. The footnotes of the Jerusalem Bible suggest that the biblical author intended the Nephilim to be an \"anecdote of a superhuman race\".\n\nSome Christian commentators have argued against this view, citing Jesus's statement that angels do not marry. Others believe that Jesus was only referring to angels in heaven.\n\nEvidence cited in favor of the fallen angels interpretation includes the fact that the phrase \"the sons of God\" (Hebrew: ; or \"sons of the gods\") is used twice outside of Genesis chapter 6, in the Book of Job (1:6 and 2:1) where the phrase explicitly references angels. The Septuagint manuscript Codex Alexandrinus reading of Genesis 6:2 renders this phrase as \"the angels of God\" while Codex Vaticanus reads \"sons\".\n\nTargum Pseudo-Jonathan identifies the Nephilim as Shemihaza and the angels in the name list from 1 Enoch.\n\nThe story of the Nephilim is further elaborated in the Book of Enoch. The Greek, Aramaic, and main Ge'ez manuscripts of 1 Enoch and Jubilees obtained in the 19th century and held in the British Museum and Vatican Library, connect the origin of the Nephilim with the fallen angels, and in particular with the egrḗgoroi (\"watchers\"). Samyaza, an angel of high rank, is described as leading a rebel sect of angels in a descent to earth to have sexual intercourse with human females:\n\nIn this tradition, the children of the Nephilim are called the Elioud, who are considered a separate race from the Nephilim, but they share the fate of the Nephilim.\n\nAccording to these texts, the fallen angels who begat the Nephilim were cast into Tartarus (2 Peter 2:4, Jude 1:6) (Greek Enoch 20:2), a place of \"total darkness\". However, Jubilees also states that God granted ten percent of the disembodied spirits of the Nephilim to remain after the flood, as demons, to try to lead the human race astray until the final Judgment.\n\nIn addition to \"Enoch\", the \"Book of Jubilees\" (7:21–25) also states that ridding the Earth of these Nephilim was one of God's purposes for flooding the Earth in Noah's time. These works describe the Nephilim as being evil giants.\n\nThere are also allusions to these descendants in the deuterocanonical books of \"Judith\" (16:6), \"Sirach\" (16:7), \"Baruch\" (3:26–28), and \"Wisdom of Solomon\" (14:6), and in the non-deuterocanonical \"3 Maccabees\" (2:4).\n\nThe New Testament Epistle of Jude (14–15) cites from 1 Enoch 1:9, which many scholars believe is based on Deuteronomy 33:2. To most commentators this confirms that the author of Jude regarded the Enochic interpretations of Genesis 6 as correct; however, others have questioned this.\n\nReferences to the offspring of Seth rebelling from God and mingling with the daughters of Cain are found from the second century CE onwards in both Christian and Jewish sources (e.g. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, Augustine of Hippo, Sextus Julius Africanus, and the Letters attributed to St. Clement). It is also the view expressed in the modern canonical Amharic Ethiopian Orthodox Bible: Henok 2:1–3 \"and the Offspring of Seth, who were upon the Holy Mount, saw them and loved them. And they told one another, 'Come, let us choose for us daughters from Cain's children; let us bear children for us.'\"\n\nOrthodox Judaism has taken a stance against the idea that Genesis 6 refers to angels or that angels could intermarry with men. Shimon bar Yochai pronounced a curse on anyone teaching this idea. Rashi and Nachmanides followed this. Pseudo-Philo (\"Biblical Antiquities\" 3:1–3) may also imply that the \"sons of God\" were human. Consequently, most Jewish commentaries and translations describe the Nephilim as being from the offspring of \"sons of nobles\", rather than from \"sons of God\" or \"sons of angels\". This is also the rendering suggested in the Targum Onqelos, Symmachus and the Samaritan Targum, which read \"sons of the rulers\", where Targum Neophyti reads \"sons of the judges\".\n\nLikewise, a long-held view among some Christians is that the \"sons of God\" were the formerly righteous descendants of Seth who rebelled, while the \"daughters of men\" were the unrighteous descendants of Cain, and the Nephilim the offspring of their union. This view, dating to at least the 1st century AD in Jewish literature as described above, is also found in Christian sources from the 3rd century if not earlier, with references throughout the Clementine literature, as well as in Sextus Julius Africanus, Ephrem the Syrian and others. Holders of this view have looked for support in Jesus' statement that \"in those days before the flood \"they\" [humans] were ... \"marrying and giving in marriage\"\" ().\n\nSome individuals and groups, including St. Augustine, John Chrysostom, and John Calvin, take the view of Genesis 6:2 that the \"Angels\" who fathered the Nephilim referred to certain human males from the lineage of Seth, who were called \"sons of God\" probably in reference to their prior covenant with Yahweh (cf. ; ); according to these sources, these men had begun to pursue bodily interests, and so took wives of \"the daughters of men\", e.g., those who were descended from Cain or from any people who did not worship God.\n\nThis also is the view of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, supported by their own Ge'ez manuscripts and Amharic translation of the Haile Selassie Bible—where the books of \"1 Enoch\" and \"Jubilees\", counted as canonical by this church, differ from western academic editions. The \"Sons of Seth view\" is also the view presented in a few extra-biblical, yet ancient works, including Clementine literature, the 3rd century \"Cave of Treasures\", and the ca. 6th Century Ge'ez work \"The Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan\". In these sources, these offspring of Seth were said to have disobeyed God, by breeding with the Cainites and producing wicked children \"who were all unlike\", thus angering God into bringing about the Deluge, as in the \"Conflict\":\n\nIn Aramaic culture, the term \"niyphelah\" refers to the Constellation of Orion and \"nephilim\" to the offspring of Orion in mythology. However the Brown-Driver-Briggs lexicon notes this as a \"dubious etymology\" and \"all very precarious\".\n\nJ. C. Greenfield mentions that \"it has been proposed that the tale of the Nephilim, alluded to in Genesis 6 is based on some of the negative aspects of the Apkallu tradition\". The \"apkallu\" in Sumerian mythology were seven legendary culture heroes from before the Flood, of human descent, but possessing extraordinary wisdom from the gods, and one of the seven \"apkallu\", Adapa, was therefore called \"son of Ea\" the Babylonian god, despite his human origin.\n\nCotton Mather believed that fossilized leg bones and teeth discovered near Albany, New York in 1705 were the remains of nephilim who perished in a great flood. However, paleontologists have identified these as mastodon remains.\n\nThe name and idea of Nephilim, like many other religious concepts, is sometimes used in popular culture. Examples include the gothic rock band Fields of the Nephilim, \"The Renquist Quartet\" novels by Mick Farren, \"The Mortal Instruments\" series by Cassandra Clare, the \"Hush, Hush\" series by Becca Fitzpatrick, and TV series \"The X-Files\" and \"Supernatural\". In the video game series Darksiders, the four horsemen of the apocalypse are said to be nephilim, wherein the nephilim were created by the unholy union of angels and demons. The main characters of the game \"\" (2013), Dante and Vergil, are also referred to as Nephilim; being the offspring of the demon Sparda and the angel Eva.\n\n"}
{"id": "233467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=233467", "title": "New York Public Library", "text": "New York Public Library\n\nThe New York Public Library (NYPL) is a public library system in New York City. With nearly 53 million items and 92 locations, the New York Public Library is the second largest public library in the United States (behind the Library of Congress) and the third largest in the world. It is a private, non-governmental, independently managed, nonprofit corporation operating with both private and public financing. The library has branches in the boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island and affiliations with academic and professional libraries in the metropolitan area of New York State. The City of New York's other two boroughs, Brooklyn and Queens, are served by the Brooklyn Public Library and the Queens Library, respectively. The branch libraries are open to the general public and consist of circulating libraries. The New York Public Library also has four research libraries, which are also open to the general public.\n\nThe library, officially chartered as The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations, was developed in the 19th century, founded from an amalgamation of grass-roots libraries and social libraries of bibliophiles and the wealthy, aided by the philanthropy of the wealthiest Americans of their age.\n\nThe New York Public Library Main Branch building, which is easily recognizable by its lion statues named Patience and Fortitude that sit either side of the entrance, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966, and designated a New York City Landmark in 1967. It has also been featured in many television shows, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"Sex and the City\", as well as films such as \"The Wiz\" in 1978, \"Ghostbusters\" in 1984, and \"The Day After Tomorrow\" in 2004.\n\nAt the behest of Joseph Cogswell, John Jacob Astor placed a codicil in his will to bequeath $400,000 (equivalent of $ million in 2017) for the creation of a public library. After Astor's death in 1848, the resulting board of trustees executed the will's conditions and constructed the Astor Library in 1854 in the East Village. The library created was a free reference library; its books were not permitted to circulate. By 1872, the Astor Library was described in a \"New York Times\" editorial as a \"major reference and research resource\", but, \"Popular it certainly is not, and, so greatly is it lacking in the essentials of a public library, that its stores might almost as well be under lock and key, for any access the masses of the people can get thereto\".\n\nAn act of the New York State Legislature incorporated the Lenox Library in 1870. The library was built on Fifth Avenue, between 70th and 71th Streets, in 1877. Bibliophile and philanthropist James Lenox donated a vast collection of his Americana, art works, manuscripts, and rare books, including the first Gutenberg Bible in the New World. At its inception, the library charged admission and did not permit physical access to any literary items.\nFormer Governor of New York and presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden believed that a library with citywide reach was required, and upon his death in 1886, he bequeathed the bulk of his fortune—about (equivalent of $ million in 2017)—to \"establish and maintain a free library and reading room in the city of New York\". This money would sit untouched in a trust for several years, until John Bigelow, a New York attorney, and Andrew Haswell Green, both trustees of the Tilden fortune, came up with an idea to merge two of the city's largest libraries.\n\nBoth the Astor and Lenox libraries were struggling financially. Although New York City already had numerous libraries in the 19th century, almost all of them were privately funded and many charged admission or usage fees. Bigelow, the most prominent supporter of the plan to merge the libraries found support in Lewis Cass Ledyard, a member of the Tilden Board, as well as John Cadwalader, on the Astor board. Eventually, John Stewart Kennedy, president of the Lenox board came to support the plan as well. On May 23, 1895, Bigelow, Cadwalader, and George L. Rives agreed to create \"The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations\". The plan was hailed as an example of private philanthropy for the public good. On December 11, John Shaw Billings was named as the library's first director. The newly established library consolidated with the grass-roots New York Free Circulating Library in February 1901.\n\nIn March, Andrew Carnegie tentatively agreed to donate (equivalent of $ million in 2017) to construct sixty-five branch libraries in the city, with the requirement that they be operated and maintained by the City of New York. The Brooklyn and Queens public library systems, which predated the consolidation of New York City, eschewed the grants offered to them and did not join the NYPL system; they believed that they would not get treatment equal to the Manhattan and the Bronx counterparts. Later in 1901, Carnegie formally signed a contract with the City of New York to transfer his donation to the city in order to enable it to justify purchasing the land for building the branch libraries. The NYPL Board of trustees hired consultants for the planning, and accepted their recommendation that a limited number of architectural firms be hired to build the Carnegie libraries: this would ensure uniformity of appearance and minimize cost. The trustees hired McKim, Mead & White, Carrère and Hastings, and Walter Cook to design all the branch libraries.\nThe notable New York author Washington Irving was a close friend of Astor for decades and had helped the philanthropist design the Astor Library. Irving served as President of the library's Board of Trustees from 1848 until his death in 1859, shaping the library's collecting policies with his strong sensibility regarding European intellectual life. Subsequently, the library hired nationally prominent experts to guide its collections policies; they reported directly to directors John Shaw Billings (who also developed the National Library of Medicine), Edwin H. Anderson, Harry M. Lydenberg, Franklin F. Hopper, Ralph A. Beals, and Edward Freehafer (1954–70). They emphasized expertise, objectivity, and a very broad worldwide range of knowledge in acquiring, preserving, organizing, and making available to the general population nearly 12 million books and 26.5 million additional items. The directors in turn reported to an elite board of trustees, chiefly elderly, well-educated, philanthropic, predominantly Protestant, upper-class white men with commanding positions in American society. They saw their role as protecting the library's autonomy from politicians as well as bestowing upon it status, resources, and prudent care.\n\nRepresentative of many major board decisions was the purchase in 1931 of the private library of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich (1847–1909), uncle of the last tsar. This was one of the largest acquisitions of Russian books and photographic materials; at the time, the Soviet government had a policy of selling its cultural collections abroad for gold.\n\nThe military drew extensively from the library's map and book collections in the world wars, including hiring its staff. For example, the Map Division's chief Walter Ristow was appointed as head of the geography section of the War Department's New York Office of Military Intelligence from 1942 to 1945. Ristow and his staff discovered, copied, and loaned thousands of strategic, rare or unique maps to war agencies in need of information not available through other sources.\n\nThe organizers of the New York Public Library, wanting an imposing main branch, chose a central site available at the two-block section of Fifth Avenue between 40th and 42nd Streets. It was occupied by the defunct Croton Reservoir. Dr. John Shaw Billings, the first director of the library, created an initial design that became the basis of the new building (now known as the Schwarzman Building) on Fifth Avenue. Billings' plan called for a huge reading room on top of seven floors of book stacks, combined with a system that was designed to get books into the hands of library users as fast as possible. Following a competition among the city's most prominent architects, Carrère and Hastings was selected to design and construct the building. The cornerstone was laid in May 1902, and the building's completion was expected to be in three years. In 1910, of shelves were installed, and it took a year to move and install the books that were in the Astor and Lenox libraries.\n\nOn May 23, 1911, the main branch of the New York Public Library was officially opened in a ceremony presided over by President William Howard Taft. After a dedication ceremony, attended by 50,000 people, the library was open to the general public that day. The library had cost to build, and its collection consisted of more than 1,000,000 volumes. The library structure was a Beaux-Arts design and was the largest marble structure up to that time in the United States. The two stone lions guarding the entrance were sculpted by E.C. Potter and carved by the Piccirilli Brothers. Its main reading room was contemporaneously the largest of its kind in the world at wide by long, with ceilings. It is lined with thousands of reference books on open shelves along the floor level and along the balcony.\n\nThe building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. Over the decades, the library system added branch libraries, and the research collection expanded. By the 1970s, it was clear the collection eventually would outgrow the existing Fifth Avenue structure. In the 1980s, the central research library added more than of space and literally miles of bookshelf space to make room for future acquisitions. This expansion required a major construction project in which Bryant Park, directly west of the library, was closed to the public and excavated. The new library facilities were built below ground level and the park was restored above it.\n\nIn the three decades before 2007, the building's interior was gradually renovated. On December 20, 2007, the library announced it would undertake a three-year, renovation of the building exterior, which has suffered damage from weathering and pollution. The renovation was completed on time, and on February 2, 2011, the refurbished facade was unveiled. The restoration design was overseen by Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc., whose previous projects include the Metropolitan Museum of Art's limestone facades and the American Museum of Natural History, made of granite. These renovations were underwritten by a $100 million gift from philanthropist Stephen A. Schwarzman, whose name was to be inscribed at the bottom of the columns framing the building's entrances. Today, the main reading room is equipped with computers with access to library collections and the Internet as well as docking facilities for laptops. A Fellows program makes reserved rooms available for writers and scholars, selected annually, and many have accomplished important research and writing at the library.\n\nIn the 1990s, the New York Public Library decided to relocate that portion of the research collection devoted to science, technology, and business to a new location. The library purchased and adapted the former B. Altman department store on 34th Street. In 1995, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the library, the Science, Industry and Business Library (SIBL), designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates of Manhattan, opened to the public. Upon the creation of the SIBL, the central research library on 42nd Street was renamed the Humanities and Social Sciences Library.\n\nToday there are four research libraries that comprise the NYPL's research library system; together they hold approximately 44,000,000 items. Total item holdings, including the collections of the Branch Libraries, are . The Humanities and Social Sciences Library on 42nd Street is still the heart of the NYPL's research library system. The SIBL, with approximately volumes and 60,000 periodicals, is the nation's largest public library devoted solely to science and business. The NYPL's two other research libraries are the Schomburg Center for Research and Black Culture, located at 135th Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem, and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, located at Lincoln Center. In addition to their reference collections, the Library for the Performing Arts and the SIBL also have circulating components that are administered as ordinary branch libraries.\n\nThe New York Public Library was not created by government statute. From its earliest days, the library was formed from a partnership of city government with private philanthropy. As of 2010, the research libraries in the system are largely funded with private money, and the branch or circulating libraries are financed primarily with city government funds. Until 2009, the research and branch libraries operated almost entirely as separate systems, but that year various operations were merged. By early 2010, the NYPL staff had been reduced by about 16 percent, in part through the consolidations.\n\nIn 2010, as part of the consolidation program, the NYPL moved various back-office operations to a new Library Services Center building in Long Island City. A former warehouse was renovated for this purpose for . In the basement, a new, book sorter uses bar codes on library items to sort them for delivery to 132 branch libraries. At two-thirds the length of a football field, the machine is the largest of its kind in the world, according to library officials. Books located in one branch and requested from another go through the sorter, which use has cut the previous waiting time by at least a day. Together with 14 library employees, the machine can sort 7,500 items an hour (or 125 a minute). On the first floor of the Library Services Center is an ordering and cataloging office; on the second, the digital imaging department (formerly at the Main Branch building) and the manuscripts and archives division, where the air is kept cooler; on the third, the Barbara Goldsmith Preservation Division, with a staff of 10 (as of 2010) but designed for as many as 30 employees.\n\nThe NYPL maintains a force of NYC special patrolmen, who provide security and protection to various libraries, and NYPL special investigators, who oversee security operations at the library facilities. These officials have on-duty arrest authority granted by the New York Penal Law. Some library branches contract for security guards.\n\nIn February 2013, the New York and Brooklyn public libraries announced that they would merge their technical services departments. The new department is called BookOps. The proposed merger anticipates a savings of $2 million for the Brooklyn Public Library and $1.5 million for the New York Public Library. Although not currently part of the merger, it is expected that the Queens Library will eventually share some resources with the other city libraries. As of 2011, circulation in the New York Public Library systems and Brooklyn Public Library systems has increased by 59%. Located in Long Island City, BookOps was created as a way to save money while improving patrons service. The services of BookOps include the Selection Team which \"acquires, describes, prepares, and delivers new items for the circulating collections of Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) and New York Public Library, and for the general collections of NYPL's research libraries.\" Under the Selection Team are the Acquisitions Department, the Cataloging Department, The Collections Processing Unit, and the Logistics Department. Before this facility opened, all the aforementioned departments were housed in different locations with no accountability between them, and items sometimes taking up to two weeks to reach their intended destination. BookOps now has all departments in one building and in 2015 sorted almost eight million items. The building has numerous rooms, including a room dedicated to caring for damaged books.\n\nThe consolidations and changes in collections have promoted continuing debate and controversy since 2004 when David Ferriero was named the Andrew W. Mellon Director and Chief Executive of the Research Libraries. NYPL had engaged consultants Booz Allen Hamilton to survey the institution, and Ferriero endorsed the survey's report as a big step \"in the process of reinventing the library\". The consolidation program has resulted in the elimination of subjects such as the Asian and Middle East Division (formerly named Oriental Division), as well as the Slavic and Baltic Division.\n\nA number of innovations in recent years have been criticized. In 2004 NYPL announced participation in the Google Books Library Project. By agreement between Google and major international libraries, selected collections of public domain books would be scanned in their entirety and made available online for free to the public. The negotiations between the two partners called for each to project guesses about ways that libraries are likely to expand in the future. According to the terms of the agreement, the data cannot be crawled or harvested by any other search engine; no downloading or redistribution is allowed. The partners and a wider community of research libraries can share the content.\n\nThe sale of the separately endowed former Donnell Library in midtown provoked controversy. The elimination of Donnell was a result of the dissolution of children's, young adult and foreign language collections. The Donnell Media Center was also dismantled, the bulk of its collection relocated at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts as the Reserve Film and Video Collection, with parts of its collection redistributed. The site was redeveloped for a luxury hotel.\n\nSeveral veteran librarians have retired, and the number of age-level specialists in the boroughs have been cut back.\nThe New York Public Library system maintains commitment as a public lending library through its branch libraries in The Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island, including the Mid-Manhattan Library, the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, the circulating collections of the Science, Industry and Business Library, and the circulating collections of the Library for the Performing Arts. The branch libraries comprise the third-largest library in the United States. These circulating libraries offer a wide range of collections, programs, and services, including the renowned Picture Collection at Mid-Manhattan Library and the Media Center, redistributed from Donnell.\n\nThe system has 39 libraries in Manhattan, 35 in the Bronx, and 13 in Staten Island. The newest is the 53rd Street Branch Library, located in Manhattan, which opened on June 26, 2016.\n\nAs of 2016, the New York Public Library consisted of four research centers and 88 neighborhood branch libraries in the three boroughs served. All libraries in the NYPL system may be used free of charge by all visitors. As of 2010, the research collections contain 44,507,623 items (books, videotapes, maps, etc.). The Branch Libraries contain 8,438,775 items. Together the collections total nearly items, a number surpassed only by the Library of Congress and the British Library.\n\nTaken as a whole, the three library systems in the city have 209 branches with 63 million items in their collections.\n\nTelephone Reference, known as ASK NYPL, answers 100,000 questions per year, by phone and online, as well as in \"The New York Times\".\n\nThe Library website provides access to the library's catalogs, online collections and subscription databases. It also has information about the library's free events, exhibitions, computer classes and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. The two online catalogs, LEO (which searches the circulating collections) and CATNYP (which searches the research collections) allow users to search the library's holdings of books, journals and other materials. The LEO system allows cardholders to request books from any branch and have them delivered to any branch.\n\nThe NYPL gives cardholders free access from home to thousands of current and historical magazines, newspapers, journals and reference books in subscription databases, including EBSCOhost, which contains full text of major magazines; full text of the \"New York Times\" (1995–present), Gale's Ready Reference Shelf which includes the \"Encyclopedia of Associations\" and periodical indexes, \"Books in Print\"; and Ulrich's Periodicals Directory. The New York Public Library also links to outside resources, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics' \"Occupational Outlook Handbook\", and the CIA's \"World Factbook\". Databases are available for children, teenagers, and adults of all ages.\n\nThe NYPL Digital Collections (formerly named Digital Gallery) is a database of over 700,000 images digitized from the library's collections. The Digital Collections was named one of \"Time Magazine\"'s 50 Coolest Websites of 2005 and Best Research Site of 2006 by an international panel of museum professionals.\n\nThe \"Photographers' Identities Catalog\" (PIC) is an experimental online service of the \"Photography Collection\" in the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building.\n\nOther databases available only from within the library include \"Nature\", IEEE and Wiley science journals, \"Wall Street Journal\" archives, and Factiva. Overall, the digital holdings for the Library consist of more than a petabyte of data as of 2015.\n\nIn 2006, the library adopted a new strategy that merged branch and research libraries into \"One NYPL\". The organizational change developed a unified online catalog for all the collections, and one card to that could be used at both branch and research libraries. The 2009 website and online-catalog transition had some initial difficulties, but ultimately the catalogues were integrated.\nThe New York Public Library offers many services to its patrons. Some of these services include services for immigrants. New York City is known for having a welcoming environment when its comes to people of diverse backgrounds. The library offers free work and life skills classes. These are offered in conjunction with volunteers and partnerships at the library. In addition, the library offers non-English speakers materials and coaching for them to acclimate to the U.S. For these non-English speakers, the library offers free ESOL classes. An initiative was taken in July 2018, NYC library card holders are allowed to visit Whitney Museum, the Guggenheim and 31 other prominent New York cultural institutions for free.\n\nThe NYPL, like all public libraries in New York, is granted a charter from the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York and is registered with the New York State Education Department. The basic powers and duties of all library boards of trustees are defined in the Education Law and are subject to Part 90 of Title 8 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations.\n\nThe NYPL's charter, as restated and granted in 1975, gives the name of the corporation as \"The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations\". The library is governed by a board of trustees, composed of between 25–42 trustees of several classes who collectively choose their own successors, including \"ex officio\" the New York City Mayor, New York City Council Speaker and New York City Comptroller.\n\nThe historian David McCullough has described the New York Public Library as one of the five most important libraries in the United States; the others are the Library of Congress, the Boston Public Library, and the university libraries of Harvard and Yale.\n\nThe New York Public Library has been referenced numerous times in popular culture. The library has appeared as a setting and topic multiple times in film, poetry, music, television, and music.\n\nThe New York Public Library, serving Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island, is one of three separate and independent public library systems in New York City. The other two library systems are the Brooklyn Public Library and the Queens Library.\n\nAccording to the 2006 \"Mayor's Management Report,\" New York City's three public library systems had a total library circulation of 35 million: the NYPL and BPL (with 143 branches combined) had a circulation of , and the Queens system had a circulation of through its 62 branch libraries. Altogether the three library systems hosted visitors in 2006.\n\nOther libraries in New York City, some of which can be used by the public, are listed in the Directory of Special Libraries and Information Centers.\n\nIn June 2017 Subway Library was announced. It was an initiative between The New York Public Library, Brooklyn Public Library, and Queens Library, the MTA, and Transit Wireless. The Subway Library gave riders access to e-books, excerpts, and short stories. Subway Library has since ended, but riders can still download free e-books via the SimplyE app or by visiting SimplyE.net.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "404425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=404425", "title": "Patagonian toothfish", "text": "Patagonian toothfish\n\nThe Patagonian toothfish, Dissostichus eleginoides, is a species of cod icefish found in cold waters () between depths of in the southern Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans and Southern Ocean on seamounts and continental shelves around most sub-Antarctic islands.\n\nA close relative, the Antarctic toothfish, (Dissostichus mawsoni) is found farther south around the edges of the Antarctic shelf; and a Marine Stewardship Council-certified fishery is active in the Ross Sea.\n\nThe average weight of a commercially caught Patagonian toothfish is , depending on the fishery, with large adults occasionally exceeding . They are thought to live up to 50 years and to reach a length up to . Several commercial fisheries exist for Patagonian toothfish which are detailed below.\n\nThis species is also sold under the trade names Chilean seabass in the United States and Canada; in Argentina, Peru and Uruguay; legine australe in France; mero in Korea, Japan, and Spain, and bacalao de profundidad in Chile.\n\nThe name \"Chilean seabass\" was invented by a fish wholesaler named Lee Lantz in 1977. He was looking for a name that would make it attractive to the American market. He considered \"Pacific sea bass\" and \"South American sea bass\" before settling on \"Chilean sea bass\". In 1994, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted \"Chilean Seabass\" as an \"alternative market name\" for Patagonian toothfish, and in 2013 for Antarctic toothfish.\n\nIn the UK, the approved commercial designations for \"D. eleginoides\" and \"D. mawsoni\" are \"icefish\" and \"toothfish\". This has created some confusion as there is a genuine \"icefish\" (\"Champsocephalus gunnari\") caught in subantarctic waters, which does not resemble toothfish in any way.\n\nPatagonian toothfish spawn in deep water (around 1,000m) during the austral winter, producing pelagic eggs and larvae. Larvae switch to a demersal habitat at around 100m (1 year old) and inhabit relatively shallow water (<300m) until 6–7 years of age, when they begin a gradual migration into deeper water. As juveniles in shallow water, toothfish are primarily piscivorous, consuming the most abundant suitably sized local prey. With increasing size and habitat depth, the diet diversifies and includes more scavenging of squid, fish, and crustaceans. In turn, toothfish constitute a small part of the diets of sperm whales, southern elephant seals, and colossal squid.\n\nAs most toothfish fisheries are managed in accordance with CCAMLR regulations and conservation measures, it should be noted that CCAMLR adopts an “ecosystem approach” which requires that all other living resources of the Southern Ocean are treated as an integrated system where effects on predator, prey and related species are considered, and decisions on sustainable harvesting levels are made on the basis of sound, internationally peer reviewed scientific advice.\n\nCommercial fishing of toothfish is managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) inside the CCAMLR Convention Area which spans the Antarctic continent and waters between 45°S and 60°S. Some fisheries inside territorial waters within the Convention Area (e.g. Crozet Island, Prince Edwards and Marion Islands) are managed separately by countries with territorial waters taking CCAMLR management practices into account. Toothfish fisheries outside the CCAMLR Convention Area in the coastal waters of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay are managed by the relevant coastal state. However, these fisheries are still subject to the CCAMLR Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) which tracks the trade of toothfish from the point of unloading to the point of final consumption.\n\nIn the legal toothfish fisheries managed by CCAMLR and countries with territorial waters, the most common method is fishing by longlines (where a long \"mainline\" is set in the water, with many baited hooks coming off that line). A small quantity of toothfish is caught by trawling (where a net is towed behind the boat for short periods of time). For all methods of legal fishing for toothfish, there are minimal interactions with, and risks to, seabirds. This is a result of requirements for legal operators to use mitigation devices or approaches such as:\n\nIn 2011 the CCAMLR Scientific Committee Chair, David Agnew, was quoted as saying “levels of seabird mortality are negligible in most areas”, with the one region yet to achieve these \"near zero\" results, having reduced seabird interactions by over 98% from their peak levels, and have continued to improve each year.\n\nTrawling generally catches toothfish in the smaller size range, which requires calculations to be made at the annual stock assessment meetings of CCAMLR to take these catches of smaller sized fish into account, and lowers the overall available catch of toothfish by trawl. CCAMLR has prohibited all trawl fishing in high seas waters and exploratory fisheries.\n\nTo minimise the risk of long-term adverse effects on target species, by-catch species and marine ecosystems, CCAMLR uses a number of compliance systems to monitor fishing activities in the Convention Area. This includes:\n\nThe Catch Documentation Scheme (CDS) for Patagonian toothfish (\"Dissostichus eleginoides\") and Antarctic toothfish (\"Dissostichus mawsoni\") was one measure that ensured reductions in illegal fishing for toothfish and reduced the scope for trade in illegally caught fish. The CDS is an innovative online catch document information system (DCD: Dissostichus Catch Document) developed to identify legal toothfish harvested, which tracks toothfish from the point of landing throughout the trade cycle to point of sale. The CDS requires verification and authorisation by national authorities at regular intervals in the trade cycle. Identification of the origin of toothfish entering the ports and markets of CDS Parties is essential.\n\nThe Coalition of Legal Toothfish Operators, Inc. (COLTO) is a toothfish fishing industry body whose members represent around 85% of the legal toothfish catch worldwide. Seven of the fisheries that are fished by COLTO members are now independently certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) as sustainable and well managed fisheries. Commercial fishing of Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish is managed by CCAMLR around most of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic regions, however a fishery that lies within a nation’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is managed by that nation, taking into account management recommendations and approaches by CCAMLR.\n\nIn 2004, the South Georgia toothfish fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 48.3) was the first toothfish fishery to be MSC certified, and was recertified in 2009 and 2014, as all MSC certified fisheries must be audited annually, and fully reassessed every five years. Currently, the South Georgia Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is 2,400t, and there are 6 longline vessels being operated by 4 companies in this fishery, which is managed by the UK overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.\n\nThe Ross Sea fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 88.1 and 88.2) was the second toothfish fishery to be independently evaluated and certified by the MSC as sustainable and well managed (in 2010, and re-certified in 2015). This fishery catches mainly Antarctic toothfish, a close relative to the Patagonian toothfish.\n\nThe Heard Island and McDonald Islands fishery (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.5.2) was certified as a sustainable and well managed fishery by the MSC in March 2012 (and re-certified in 2017) and is operated under Australian jurisdiction in a manner consistent with CCAMLR regulations. There are 4 vessels operated by 2 Australian companies (Austral Fisheries and Australian Longline). The CCAMLR determined TAC is 3,405t of toothfish for the 2016/17 season.\n\nThe Macquarie Island toothfish fishery is within the Australian EEZ, and is situated outside the CCAMLR Convention Area within FAO Statistical Area 81, though it is managed in a complementary way with the conservation measures adopted by CCAMLR. In May 2012, this was the fourth toothfish fishery to gain MSC certification (and re-certified in 2017). There are 2 Australian companies that are allocated to catch 450t of toothfish in 2017/18.\n\nFrance regulates Patagonian toothfish in the waters surrounding the French islands in the South Indian Ocean, with scientific oversight from the National Museum of Natural History. These fisheries are located around the Kerguelen Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.5.1) and the Crozet Islands (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58.6). Fishing authorizations have been granted to six fishing companies based out of Reunion Island. The TAC for the Kerguelen Island fishery is 5,050 t and was certified by the MSC in September 2013. The current TAC for the Crozet Islands fishery is 1,300 t, and was certified by the MSC in 2017.\n\nThe Falkland Islands, a self-governing British Overseas Territory, also has a toothfish fishery and was awarded MSC certification in 2014. The Falklands do not fall in the CCAMLR Convention area, though regulations on fishing methods, science and management mirror CCAMLR requirements. The TAC is currently 1,040 t and is caught by a sole longline vessel.\n\nCombined, over 50% of all legally harvested toothfish is independently assessed and certified by the MSC as being from sustainable and well managed fisheries.\n\nThe Chilean toothfish fishery is separated into two separate fleets. The \"artisanal fleet\" of small boats operates in the region north of 47°S inside the Chilean EEZ; and 8 vessels from the \"industrial fleet\" operate south of 47°S inside the Chilean EEZ as well as on the high seas both within and outside CCAMLR waters. The TAC for the industrial fleet is determined each year by the Chilean government based on biological studies carried out by both public and private scientific bodies. The current Chilean TAC for the industrial fleet is 1,656t that is caught by 3 companies. Since 2006, artisanal fleet catches have fluctuated between 2,091t and 1,558t per annum. Its current quota is 1,491 t.\n\nArgentina has a toothfish fishery off its coastline that is managed by the Argentine Federal Fisheries Council under recommendations from the National Fisheries Research Institute. This season the Argentine TAC is 3,700 t that is caught by five vessels from four companies.\n\nThe Prince Edward and Marion Islands toothfish fishery is managed and regulated by Branch Fisheries, part of the South African Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The South African Marine Resource Authorities fully supports and follows all CCAMLR Conservation Measures. The current TAC is 575t and is fished by two vessels belonging to two fishing companies/cooperatives, with catches having been restricted significantly following excessive illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in those waters in the late 1990s. TACs from this fishery have slowly started to increase as the stock begins to recover.\n\nThe total allowable catch of toothfish worldwide is around 28,300 tonnes in 2017, with around 85% of this coming from COLTO members, and 56% of the total catch (15,900 tonnes) now being independently certified as coming from sustainable and well managed fisheries by the Marine Stewardship Council.\n\nIn the late 1990s to early 2000s, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) for toothfish nearly collapsed some fisheries in the Southern Ocean. Though, since 2005, because of CCAMLR Member nations, government patrol vessels, NGOs, media exposure and a trade and port state measures, IUU fishing has been all but eliminated from within countries' exclusive economic zones, and until 2015 a relatively small portion of IUU fishing still occurred in high seas areas. In 2014 and 2015 there were several major campaigns to eliminate IUU fishing for toothfish. This included the Sea Shepherd campaign, \"\"Operation Icefish\", which pursued one of the vessels, the \"Thunder\", for 110 days before it was scuttled. Operations by the Royal New Zealand Navy, the Royal Australian Navy, Interpol, and governments of Spain, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia all combined to successfully apprehend, arrest and prosecute all of the remaining 6 IUU vessels fishing illegally for toothfish on the high seas.\n\nAt the peak of IUU fishing, illegal catches were estimated to be 32,000 tonnes in 1997 with approximately 55 vessels believed to be active. By 2010, IUU catches had fallen to an estimated 1,615 tonnes, all taken in high seas areas, with just four IUU fishing vessels reported to be active. This was a decrease in IUU fishing by over 95% since the mid 1990s. CCAMLR estimated in 2012 that 90% of IUU catches at the time were of Antarctic toothfish, not Patagonian toothfish.\n\nCCAMLR annually reviews information on IUU fishing activities in the Convention Area and has established a Contracting Party and a Non-Contracting Party IUU Vessel List (CCAMLR Conservation Measure 10-06 and Conservation Measure 10-07). Vessels included on the IUU Vessel Lists have engaged in IUU activities in the Convention Area and undermined the effectiveness of conservation measures, thereby threatening toothfish stocks, marine habitats and by-catch species. Vessels are included on the IUU Vessel Lists after a consensus decision from the Commission based on set criteria. This measure, combined with additional surveillance by member nations, catch documentation schemes has played a significant part in the reduction of IUU fishing for toothfish.\n\nIn the past, France sold some fishing rights to Japanese and other foreign fisheries, but because of IUU fishing, rights are now reserved for French fishers based at Réunion Island. Because of previous poaching, the French Navy and Australian Customs vessels still work in concert, patrolling both French and Australian EEZs, having made numerous arrests and seizures in the late 1990s to early 2000s. An Australian Customs vessel, the \"Southern Supporter\", was involved in the renowned chase and apprehension of an IUU vessel in the 2003 \"Viarsa\" incident that stretched over 7,200 kilometers.\n\nTACs for legal operators in CCAMLR are set, taking into account the estimated IUU catches from past years, and any current IUU activity that may be occurring in the different fisheries. In some fisheries this has meant a considerable reduction in legal catches – an example of this is the Australian Heard Island and McDonald Islands fishery, where the legal TAC was 3,800t in 1996/97. This was dropped to a minimum of 2,427t by 2006/07 with a substantial portion of that decline attributed to the IUU catches taken from the fishery between 1996 and 2002. Since then there has been zero IUU fishing in that fishery, and the legal TAC has steadily increased.\n\nIn addition to the Catch Documentation System mentioned above, USA regulations do not allow toothfish imports without valid Dissostichus Catch Documents; and dealer permit and pre-approval certificates issued in advance by NOAA. In addition, toothfish must be caught from vessels equipped with satellite-linked automated VMS that track vessel movements from port-to-port to ensure compliance with set quotas and boundaries. All vessel VMS data must be reported to the centralized CCAMLR system, with confirmation to USA required that it has occurred, in order for any products from those boats to be imported into the United States.\n\nAs revealed by the \"Black spider memos\", Charles, Prince of Wales, was worried about the future for the species. An open reply noted that sea birds had indeed been protected in toothfish fisheries globally, and that IUU fishing was virtually eliminated.\n\nThe EU has also imposed requirements against IUU fishing that include:\n\nPatagonian Toothfish is currently listed by the Monterey Bay Aquarium on its Seafood Watch list and pocket guides. In April 2013, Seafood Watch produced an updated report, indicating new ratings for some fisheries, which allocates approximately 78% of toothfish caught worldwide, which are as follows:\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International added the Patagonian toothfish to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.\" Greenpeace have not updated their rating of toothfish since the 2013 Monterey Bay Aquarium review.\n\n\n"}

It is the second entry in his trilogy of metrical films, between \"Adebar\" and \"Arnulf Rainer\".\n\nOriginally commissioned to make an advertisement for , Kubelka edited footage from the shoot based on a complex set of rules, producing a rapid procession of images. Although the company was displeased with the commercial, \"Schwechater\" found favour as a work of avant-garde cinema.\n\n\"Schwechater\" contains 1,440 frames, making it exactly one minute long when projected at the standard rate of 24 frames per second. The film has no narrative, and it cuts between images quickly enough that they form flickering patterns.\n\nFour different moving images appear throughout the film. One shows a woman sitting at a table as beer is poured into her glass, and another shows her drinking the beer. There is also footage of a champagne glass filled with beer as well as a group of people in a restaurant.\n\nThe Schwechater Bier brewery commissioned Kubelka to make an advertisement for its beer. Kubelka shot using an old, hand-operated 35 mm scientific camera. The camera had no viewfinder, and Kubelka largely ignored the composition of the images. Once the film stock was used up, Kubelka humored the art director for Schwechater Bier and cranked the empty camera, pretending to continue filming.\n\nKubelka used four shots spanning 16, 30, 90, and 1,440 frames as the material for \"Schwechater\". He produced high-contrast positive and negative prints, copied so that each shot looped for exactly 1,440 frames. After getting the developed film from the laboratory, Kubelka let it sit for six weeks until executives from Schwechater Bier began asking about the commercial.\n\nThe editing process for \"Schwechater\" lasted six months. Kubelka produced a score for the film with a complex system of overlapping structures to determine how to combine the eight film strips. One such structure specifies outlines the gradual permeation of the colour red in \"Schwechater\". The film starts alternates between black-and-white sequences and red sequences; the black and white sequences decrease in duration from 110 frames down to 10 frames as the red sequences remain are all roughly 30 frames. As such, the film becomes increasingly red over the course of its runtime.\n\nAnother structure specifies which frames do and do not contain images. Each sequence of frames with images is immediately followed by a sequence of the same length containing frames showing a solid color—either black or red. The frame count of these sequences traverses the powers of two, from 1 up to 32 and back down.\n\nFor the film's soundtrack, Kubelka created a score of rasping sounds and beeps. The intermittent periods of sound happen parallel to the red-tinted sequences, with a low hum and one to three sine tones. When the Schwechater logo appears at the end of the film, Kubelka used a sustained, high-pitched sine tone.\n\nAfter Kubelka delivered the finished version to Schwechater, they stopped payment to him, ended their relation with him, and destroyed the company's print of the film. Initial reaction to \"Schwechater\" was very negative. The company sued Kubelka, and the film lab, which had Schwechater as a client, stopped making prints for him. His decision to leave Austria was in part because of the response to \"Schwechater\".\n\nThe film found success on the European film festival circuit.

Under the doctrine, as long as the facilities provided to each race were equal, state and local governments could require that services, facilities, public accommodations, housing, medical care, education, employment, and transportation be segregated by race, which was already the case throughout the former Confederacy. The phrase was derived from a Louisiana law of 1890, although the law actually used the phrase \"equal but separate\".\n\nThe doctrine was confirmed in the \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" Supreme Court decision of 1896, which allowed state-sponsored segregation. Though segregation laws existed before that case, the decision emboldened segregation states during the Jim Crow era, which had commenced in 1876 and supplanted the Black Codes, which restricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African-Americans during the Reconstruction Era. \n\nIn practice the separate facilities provided to African Americans were rarely equal; usually they were not even close to equal, or they did not exist at all. For example, according to the 1934–36 report of the Florida Superintendent of Public Instruction, the value of \"white school property\" in the state was $70,543,000, while the value of African-American school property was $4,900,000. The report says that \"in a few south Florida counties and in most north Florida counties many Negro schools are housed in churches, shacks, and lodges, and have no toilets, water supply, desks, blackboards, etc. [See Station One School.] Counties use these schools as a means to get State funds and yet these counties invest little or nothing in them.\" High school education for African Americans was provided in only 28 of Florida's 67 counties.\n\nThe doctrine of separate but equal was overturned by a series of Supreme Court decisions, starting with \"Brown v. Board of Education\" of 1954. However, the overturning of segregation laws in the United States was a long process that lasted through much of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, involving federal legislation (especially the Civil Rights Act of 1964), and many court cases.\n\nThe American Civil War brought slavery in the United States to an end, with the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865. Following the war, the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteed equal protection under the law to all people, and Congress established the Freedmen's Bureau to assist the integration of former slaves into Southern society. After the end of Reconstruction with the Compromise of 1877, and the withdrawal of federal troops from all Southern states, former slave-holding states enacted various laws to undermine the equal treatment of African Americans, although the Fourteenth Amendment as well as federal Civil Rights laws enacted during reconstruction were meant to guarantee it. However, Southern states contended that the requirement of equality could be met in a way that kept the races separate. Furthermore, the state and federal courts tended to reject the pleas by African Americans that their Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated, arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to federal, not state, citizenship. This rejection is evident in the Slaughter-House Cases and Civil Rights Cases.\n\nAfter the end of Reconstruction, the federal government adopted a general policy of leaving racial segregation up to the individual states. One example of this policy was the second Morrill Act (Morrill Act of 1890). Before the end of the war, the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act (Morrill Act of 1862) had provided federal funding for higher education by each state with the details left to the state legislatures. The 1890 Act implicitly accepted the legal concept of \"separate but equal\" for the 17 states that had institutionalized segregation.\n\nProvided, That no money shall be paid out under this act to any State or Territory for the support and maintenance of a college where a distinction of race or color is made in the admission of students, but the establishment and maintenance of such colleges \"separately\" for white and colored students shall be held to be a compliance with the provisions of this act if the funds received in such State or Territory be \"equitably\" divided as hereinafter set forth.\nPrior to the Second Morrill Act, 17 states excluded blacks from access to the land grant colleges without providing similar educational opportunities. In response to the Second Morrill Act, 17 states established separate land grant colleges for blacks which are now referred to as public historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). In fact, some states adopted laws prohibiting schools from educating blacks and whites together, even if a school was willing to do so. (The Constitutionality of such laws was upheld in \"Berea College v. Kentucky\", 211 U.S. 45 (1908).) Under the 'separate but equal doctrine', blacks were entitled to receive the same public services and accommodations such as schools, bathrooms, and water fountains, but states were allowed to maintain different facilities for the two groups. The legitimacy of such laws under the 14th Amendment was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1896 case of \"Plessy v. Ferguson\", \"163 U.S. 537.\" The \"Plessy\" doctrine was extended to the public schools in \"Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education\", 175 U.S. 528 (1899).\n\nAlthough the Constitutional doctrine required equality, the facilities and social services offered to African-Americans were almost always of lower quality than those offered to white Americans; for example, many African American schools received less public funding per student than nearby white schools. In Texas, the state established a state-funded law school for white students without any law school for black students.\n\nIn 1892, Homer Plessy, who was of mixed ancestry and appeared to be white, boarded an all-white railroad car between New Orleans and Covington, Louisiana. The conductor of the train collected passenger tickets at their seats. When Plessy told the conductor he was 7/8ths white and 1/8th black, he was advised he needed to move to a coloreds-only car. Plessy said he resented sitting in a coloreds-only car and was arrested immediately.\n\nOne month after his arrest, Plessy appeared in court before Judge John Howard Ferguson. Plessy's lawyer, Albion Tourgee, claimed Plessy’s 13th and 14th amendment rights were violated. The 13th amendment abolished slavery, and the 14th amendment granted equal protection to all under the law.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision in \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" established the phrase \"separate but equal\". The ruling required \"railway companies carrying passengers in their coaches in that State to provide equal, but separate, accommodations for the white and colored races\". Accommodations provided on each railroad car were required to be the same as those provided on the others. Separate railroad cars could be provided. The railroad could refuse service to passengers who refused to comply, and the Supreme Court ruled this did not infringe upon the 13th and 14th amendments.\n\nThe \"separate but equal\" doctrine applied to railroad cars and to schools, voting rights, and drinking fountains. Segregated schools were created for students, as long as they followed \"separate but equal\". The majority of all black schools received old textbooks, used equipment, and poorly prepared or trained teachers. A study conducted by the American Psychological Association found that black students were emotionally impaired when segregated at a young age. State voting right restrictions, such as literacy tests and poll taxes, created an environment that made it almost impossible for blacks to vote. This era also saw separate drinking fountains in public areas.\n\nThe \"Separate but Equal\" doctrine was eventually overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of \"Brown v. Board of Education\" in 1954, although the implementation of the changes this implied was long, contentious, and sometimes violent. (See Massive resistance and Southern Manifesto.) Modern legal doctrine interprets the 14th amendment to prohibit \"explicit\" segregation on the basis of race.\n\nThe repeal of such restrictive laws, generally known as Jim Crow laws, was a key focus of the Civil Rights Movement prior to 1954. In \"Sweatt v. Painter\", the Supreme Court addressed a legal challenge to the doctrine by a student seeking admission to a state-supported law school in Texas. Because Texas did not have a law school for blacks, the lower court delayed the case until Texas could create one. However, the Supreme Court ordered that the student be admitted to the white law school on the grounds that the separate school failed to qualify as being \"equal\", both because of quantitative differences in facilities and intangible factors, such as its isolation from most of the future lawyers with whom its graduates would interact. The court held that, when considering graduate education, intangibles must be considered as part of \"substantive equality\". The same day, the Supreme Court in \"McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents\" ruled that Oklahoma segregation laws which required a graduate student working on a Doctor of Education degree to sit in the hallway outside the classroom door did not qualify as \"separate but equal\". These cases ended \"separate but equal\" in graduate and professional education.\n\nIn \"Brown v. Board of Education\", \"347 U.S. 483\" (1954), attorneys for the NAACP referred to the phrase \"equal but separate\" used in \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" as a custom \"de jure\" racial segregation enacted into law. The NAACP, led by the soon-to-be first black Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, was successful in challenging the constitutional viability of the separate but equal doctrine, and the court voted to overturn sixty years of law that had developed under \"Plessy\". The Supreme Court outlawed segregated public education facilities for blacks and whites at the state level. The companion case of \"Bolling v. Sharpe\", \"347 U.S. 497\" outlawed such practices at the Federal level in the District of Columbia. The court held:\nWe conclude that, in the field of public education, the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAlthough \"Brown\" overturned the doctrine of separate but equal with respect to institutions of public education, it would be almost ten more years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would prohibit private discrimination in facilities, such as transportation and hotels, that were considered public accommodations. Additionally, in 1967 under \"Loving v. Virginia\", the United States Supreme Court declared Virginia's anti-miscegenation statute, the \"Racial Integrity Act of 1924\", unconstitutional, and invalidated all anti-miscegenation laws in the United States. Although federal legislation prohibits racial discrimination in college admissions, the historically black colleges and universities continue to teach student bodies that are 75% to 90% African American. This however does not necessarily indicate racial discrimination within college admissions in those schools when factors such as student preference are taken into account. In 1975, Jake Ayers Sr. filed a lawsuit against Mississippi, stating that they gave more financial support to the predominantly white public colleges. The state settled the lawsuit in 2002, directing $503 million to three historically black colleges over 17 years.\n\n\n"}

They differ from their now much smaller rival Akhbari group in favoring the use of \"ijtihad\" (i.e., reasoning) in the creation of new rules of \"fiqh\"; in assessing hadith to exclude traditions they believe unreliable; and in considering it obligatory to obey a \"mujtahid\" when seeking to determine Islamically correct behavior.\n\nSince the crushing of the Akhbaris in the late 18th century, it has been the dominant school of Twelver Shi'a and now forms an overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia denomination.\n\nThe name \"Usuli\" derives from the term \"Uṣūl al-fiqh\" (principles of jurisprudence). In Usuli thought, there are four valid sources of law: the Quran, hadith, ijma' and 'aql. Ijma' refers to a unanimous consensus. Aql, in Shia jurisprudence, is applied to four practical principles which are applied when other religious proofs are not applicable: \"bara'at\" (immunity), \"ihtiyat\" (recommended precautions), \"takhyir\" (selection), and \"istishab\" (the presumption of continuity in the previous state).\n\nThe term Usuli is also sometimes used to refer more generally to students of usul especially among early Muslims, without regard to Shia Islam. Students/scholars of the \"principles\" of fiqh are distinguished from scholars of \"fiqh\" itself, whose scholars are known as \"faqīh\" (plural \"fuqahā\"'). \n\nThe Usuli believe that the Hadith collections contained traditions of varying degrees of reliability, and that critical analysis was necessary to assess their authority. In contrast the Akhbari believe that the sole sources of law are the Qur'an and the Hadith, in particular the Four Books accepted by the Shia: everything in these sources is in principle reliable, and outside them there was no authority competent to enact or deduce further legal rules.\n\nIn addition to assessing the reliability of the Hadith, Usuli believe the task of the legal scholar is to establish intellectual principles of general application (\"Usul al-fiqh\"), from which particular rules may be derived by way of deduction. Accordingly, Usuli legal scholarship has the tools in principle for resolving new situations that are not already addressed in Quran or Hadith (see Ijtihad).\n\nAn important tenet of Usuli doctrine is Taqlid or \"imitation\", i.e. the acceptance of a religious ruling in matters of worship and personal affairs from someone regarded as a higher religious authority (e.g. an 'ālim) without necessarily asking for the technical proof. These higher religious authorities can be known as a \"source of imitation\" (Arabic \"marja taqlid\" مرجع تقليد, Persian marja) or less exaltedly as an \"imitated one\" (Arabic مقلَد \"muqallad\"). However, his verdicts are not to be taken as the only source of religious information and he can be always corrected by other muqalladeen (the plural of muqallad) which come after him. Obeying a deceased taqlid is forbidden in Usuli.\n\nTaqlid has been introduced by scholars who felt that Quranic verses and traditions were not enough and that ulama were needed not only to interpret the Quran and Sunna but to make \"new rulings to respond to new challenges and push the boundaries of Shia law in new directions.\"\n\nBy their debates and books, Al-Mufid, Sayyid-al Murtada, and Shaykh al-Tusi in Iraq, were the first to introduce the \"Uṣūl al-fiqh\" (principles of Islamic jurisprudence) under the influence of the Shafe'i and Mu'tazili doctrines. Al-Kulayni, in Rey, and al-Sadduq, in Qom, were concerned with a traditionalist approach. The second wave of the Usuli was shaped in the Mongol period when al-Hilli introduced the term \"mujtahid\", meaning an individual qualified to deduce ordinances on the basis of authentic religious arguments. By developing the theory of the \"usul\", al-Hilli introduced more legal and logical norms which extended the meaning of the \"usul\" beyond the four principle sources. Amili was the first scholar to fully formulate the principles of \"ijtihad\". \n\nThese traditional principles of Shi'a jurisprudence were challenged by the 17th-century Akhbari school, led by Muhammad Amin al-Astarabadi. A reaction against Akhbari arguments was led in the last half of the 18th century by Muhammad Baqir Behbahani. He attacked the Akhbari and their method was abandoned by Shia. The dominance of the Usuli over the Akhbari came when Behbahani led the Usuli to dominance and \"completely routed the Akhbaris at Karbala and Najaf,\" so that \"only a handful of Shi'i ulama have remained Akhbari to the present day.\"\n\n\n"}

These principles were enshrined as a constitutional principal for the new nation and were radically opposed to the political, cultural, and social practices that had existed during three hundred years of colonization.\n\nSeven of the ten provinces belonging to the Captaincy General of Venezuela declared their independence and explained their reasons for this action, among them, that it was baneful that a small European nation ruled the great expanses of the New World, that Spanish America recovered its right to self-government after the abdications of Charles IV and Ferdinand VII at Bayonne, and that the political instability in Spain dictated that Venezuelans rule themselves, despite the brotherhood they shared with Spaniards. The seven provinces were Caracas Province, Cumaná Province, Barinas Province, Margarita Province, Barcelona Province, Mérida Province and Trujillo Province.\n\nThe three remaining provinces (Maracaibo Province, Coro Province and Guayana Province) which did not take part in the Venezuelan congress opted to stay under Spanish rule.\n\nThe declaration proclaimed a new nation called the American Confederacy of Venezuela and was mainly written by Cristóbal Mendoza and Juan Germán Roscio.

The book is cited today as having influenced the careers of several Michelin starred and celebrity chefs, and was described by one critic as \"possibly the most influential recipe book of the last 20 years\".\n\nInitially published in 1990, \"White Heat\" was part autobiography of chef Marco Pierre White and part cookbook, that portrays White's \"bad boy\" chef image. White was introduced by actress Lowri-Ann Richards to her friend Bob Carlos Clarke. Clarke photographed White for a Levi jeans advert and went on to create the images for \"White Heat\". Speaking following Clarke's death in 2006, Marco Pierre White said, \"He was like my prop. Without Bob there would never have been \"White Heat\".\"\n\n\"White Heat\" is credited with changing the image of chefs to sex symbols. The photographs showed White in and out of the workplace, including smoking in the kitchen and working with his team, including a young Gordon Ramsay. One of the photographs featured White with a dead baby shark, which was laid across his lap in Clarke's garden for the shot. Clarke's wife Lindsay later said in an interview that Marco went on to gut the shark there and then in the garden, \"The stench was unbelievable. I was pregnant at the time and the odour haunted me.\" Another photograph featured White nude with a side of piglet in his lap. One of Clarke's images of White was included in a set of ten donated to the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 2013.\n\nJohn Lanchester, for \"The Observer\" magazine supplement \"Life\" in 2003, described the book as \"gastroporn\". Sue Gaisford, reviewing the book for \"The Independent\", described it as a \"Marco Pierre White fanzine-with-recipes\" and an \"ego-trip\". In 2005 food critic Jay Rayner called \"White Heat\" \"possibly the most influential recipe book of the last 20 years\".\n\n\"White Heat\" is credited as being the first chef memoir, and has been cited as influencing the future careers of Michelin starred chefs, including Sat Bains and Tom Kerridge, and celebrity chefs Curtis Stone and Jean-Christophe Novelli.\n\n\"The New York Times\" published an article on 13 May 1998 describing White's career, using a passage from \"White Heat\" to say that the chef had a \"well-publicized bout with drugs and alcohol\". It published an apology to the chef regarding this statement later that year on 16 September, describing the passage it had used from the book as \"ambiguous\". The passage described White going on a drink and drugs \"bender\", something that White later denied in court during the libel case, saying that he did not proof-read his books as he is dyslexic.\n\nWhite's first appearance on the television show \"Hell's Kitchen\" in 2007 caused the price of second-hand copies of his old cookbooks to spike. \"White Heat\" had been seen as a collector's item, but after the television show, the price increased to as much as £250 for a signed first edition. In 2008 it was recommended by television chef Michael Symon, writing for \"Women's Health\", despite being out of print in America at the time.
