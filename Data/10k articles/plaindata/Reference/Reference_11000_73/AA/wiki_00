The report investigates the circumstances surrounding the death of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad. Upon submission, the report was immediately classified by the Prime Minister and its findings were not made public.<ref name=\"Express Tribune, 06/13\"></ref>\n\nIndicated by the media, the report compiled the 700-pages, which lists some 200 recommendations after interviewing over 300 witnesses and scrutinising more than 3,000 documents pertaining to the raid by US special operations forces to kill al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on 2 May 2011.<ref name=\"Express Tribune, 01/13\"></ref> In response to American unilateral actions, the government formed the commission which was to find out exactly what happened and who was responsible for failing to catch the high-profile target, who had taken refuge in Abbottabad. In 2013, parts of the reports published by the news channels in the country and most of the findings of the said report were leaked to the press and were strongly criticised by defence experts. The government then classified all of its publications despite American reservations and concerns, but the report was released by Al Jazeera on 8 July 2013.\n\nIn 2011, the United States took unilateral actions to target and kill al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, who was reportedly in hiding in Abottabad, in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. After much criticism, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani formed the commission under Senior Justice Javed Iqbal. Soon after conducting session interviews, Senior Justice Iqbal announced that Abbottabad Commission report will be made public in a few weeks. Despite Iqbal's claims, the commission did not release the report and its preparation period further prolonged to next years.\n\nIn 2012, the Pakistani Ministry of Justice (MoJ) issued a notification to the commission on asking to complete its investigation and submit the report on 12 October 2012.\n\nParts of the report duly recommended a trial against the medical doctor-turned spy, Dr. Shakil Afridi. Asked by a journalist for delaying of the report, Senior Justice Iqbal maintained that the presence of CIA in Pakistan is also being investigated, adding that it would be mentioned in the report. To another question by a journalist as to whether the person killed in the compound in Abbottabad was Osama bin Laden, Justice Javed Iqbal quoted: If we tell you that what's left... You'll find out soon.\"\n\nRevealed by the British \"Daily Telegraph\", the papers ultimately cleared the Government, armed forces, the establishment, and intelligence services of involvement in protection of the al-Qaeda chief. American literary political critics have accused Pakistan officials of knowing more about Osama's presence than they were letting on. United States had been long demanding Pakistan to declassify the papers of the reports, maintaining that it is important for the Pakistani and American public to see the report of Abbottabad Commission. All request had been dismissed by the Government of Pakistan.\n\nBefore the full submission of the papers in 2013, only a few parts of the papers were obtained by the \"World News channel of Pakistan and televised it all over the nation in 2012. Following the broadcast, the US State Department declined to comment on the report.\n\nIn an official press briefing to media, the US State Department maintained that \"U.S. shares with Pakistan a \"profound\" interest in learning about what kind of support network al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden might have had during his hiding but would only comment on the Abbottabad Commission's findings on the issue when it gets the actual report.\" Sensing the impact on the military, the defence authors had had earlier hinted to media that the papers would be marked as classified expect little of substance to be revealed. Excerpts leaked to the press from the yet-to-be-made-public report differed with the American account of the incident.\n\nIn January 2013, the final report was submitted to Prime Minister Pervez Ashraf to review the papers. After briefly reviewing the papers, Prime Minister Ashraf classified the publications of the report before leaving the office.\n\nThe report of the Abbottabad Commission, formed in June 2011 to probe the circumstances around the killing of Osama bin Laden by American forces in a unilateral raid on the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, was leaked by the Al Jazeera Investigative Unit on 8 July 2013, after being suppressed by the Pakistani government. The report drew on testimony from more than 200 witnesses, including members of Bin Laden's family, Pakistan's then spy chief Ahmad Shuja Pasha, senior ministers in the government and officials at every level of the military, bureaucracy and security services. The four-member Abbottabad Commission interviewed 201 people, including the country's intelligence leaders, in an effort to piece together the events around the American raid on 2 May 2011, that killed Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, and embarrassed the Pakistani government. The commission was led by Justice Javed Iqbal of the Pakistani Supreme Court, a retired police officer, a diplomat and an army general. It first met in July 2011, two months after the American raid, and has held 52 hearings and conducted seven field visits.\n\nOsama bin Laden was able to hide in Pakistan for nine years due to the \"collective failure\" of state military and intelligence authorities and \"routine\" incompetence at every level of civil governance structure allowed the once world's most wanted man to move to six different locations within the country. The Commission's 336-page report is scathing, holding both the government and the military responsible for \"gross incompetence\" leading to \"collective failures\" that allowed both Bin Laden to escape detection, and the United States to perpetrate \"an act of war\". It found that Pakistan's intelligence establishment had \"closed the book\" on bin Laden by 2005, and was no longer actively pursuing intelligence that could lead to his capture. The Abbottabad Commission report blasted the Pakistani government and military for a \"national disaster\" over its handling of bin Laden and calls on the leadership to apologise to the people of Pakistan for their \"dereliction of duty.\"\n\nThe document repeatedly returned to what it describes as \"government implosion syndrome\" to explain the failure of any institution to investigate Bin Laden's unusual hideout. \"It is a glaring testimony to the collective incompetence and negligence, at the very least, of the security and intelligence community in the Abbottabad area,\" said the report. \"How the entire neighbourhood, local officials, police and security and intelligence officials all missed the size, the strange shape, the barbed wire, the lack of cars and visitors … over a period of nearly six years beggars belief,\" it said. The report said that Bin Laden must have required a support network \"that could not possibly have been confined to the two Pashtun brothers who worked as his couriers, security guards and general factotums\". The report said: \"Over a period of time an effective intelligence agency should have been able to contact, infiltrate or co-opt them and to develop a whole caseload of information. Apparently, this was not the case.\" The commission didn't rule out the possibility of involvement by rogue Pakistani intelligence officers, who have been accused of deliberately shielding Bin Laden by some commentators. \"Given the length of stay and the changes of residence of [Bin Laden] and his family in Pakistan … the possibility of some such direct or indirect and \"plausibly deniable\" support cannot be ruled out, at least, at some level outside formal structures of the intelligence establishment.\" \"Connivance, collaboration and cooperation at some levels cannot be entirely discounted,\" it said.\n\nThe commission made several findings. Among these include:\n\nWith respect to the death of bin Laden at the hands of US Navy SEALs, the report concluded: \n\nThe Pakistani military's inability to prevent an American incursion into its airspace was described as the country's greatest \"humiliation\" since 1971, when Indian forces routed Pakistan in a war that led to the creation of the present-day state of Bangladesh, according to the report. Despite American assurances that US forces would enter Pakistan if they thought they could capture Osama bin Laden, Pakistani air defences were set to a \"peace time mode\" when American helicopters crossed into Pakistani airspace, the report stated. The report didn't name the persons responsible for the failures in the hunt for bin Laden as well as the American intrusion into Pakistan and said that it may be politically unrealistic to suggest punishments for them, but \"as honourable men, they ought to do the honourable thing, including submitting a formal apology to the nation for their dereliction of duty.\"\n"}

He is chiefly remembered for reprinting much rare Elizabethan literature, a work which he undertook because of his interest in Puritan theology.\n\nThe son of a building contractor, he was born at Stirling and educated at the University of Edinburgh. In 1856 he became a minister of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland at Kinross, serving the congregation known as First United Presbyterian Church. In 1865 he went to Liverpool, and three years later to Blackburn.\n\nHe resigned from the ministry in 1892, and died at Dublin.\n\nAmong the first writers whose works he edited were the Puritan writers, Richard Sibbes, Thomas Brooks and Herbert Palmer. Editions of Michael Bruce's \"Poems\" (1865) and Richard Gilpin's \"Demonologia sacra\" (1867) followed. In 1868 he brought out a bibliography of the writings of Richard Baxter, and from that year until 1876 he was occupied in reproducing for private subscribers the “Fuller Worthies Library,” a series of thirty-nine volumes which included the works of Thomas Fuller, Sir John Davies, Fulke Greville, Edward de Vere, Henry Vaughan, Andrew Marvell, George Herbert, Richard Crashaw, John Donne and Sir Philip Sidney. The last four volumes of the series were devoted to the works of many little known and otherwise inaccessible authors. He also wrote a biography of the Scottish poet, Robert Fergusson (Edinburgh: Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier, 1898)\nin the “Famous Scots Series”.\n\nHis \"Occasional Issues of Unique and Very Rare Books\" (1875–1881) included among other things the \"Annalia Dubrensia\" of Robert Dover. In 1876 still another series, known as the “Chertsey Worthies Library,” was begun. It included editions of the works of Nicholas Breton, Francis Quarles, Dr Joseph Beaumont, Abraham Cowley, Henry More and John Davies of Hereford.\n\nThe two last-named series were being produced simultaneously until 1881, and no sooner had they been completed than Grosart began the “Huth Library,” so called from the bibliophile Henry Huth, who possessed the originals of many of the reprints. It included the works of Robert Greene, Thomas Nashe, Gabriel Harvey, and the prose tracts of Thomas Dekker. He also edited the complete works of Edmund Spenser and Samuel Daniel. From the Townley Hall collection he reprinted several manuscripts and edited Sir John Eliot's works, Sir Richard Boyle's \"Lismore Papers\", and various publications for the Chetham Society, the Camden Society and the Roxburghe Club.\n\n\n"}

The goal of the publication of the cards was two-fold according to Fort Drum archaeologist Laurie Rush - to prevent unnecessary damage to ancient sites and to stem the illegal trade of artifacts in Iraq. The military has long recognized that educational playing cards are a good way to capitalize on the time soldiers spend waiting for orders.\n\nThey were devised following the success of the most-wanted Iraqi playing cards (officially called \"personality identification playing cards\") that were used in the 2003 invasion of Iraq to help members of the U.S. military identify wanted personnel from the Baathist regime. Approximately 40,000 sets of the cards were issued to U.S. forces. In the archaeology deck, each suit has a theme: diamonds for artifacts, spades for digs, hearts for \"winning hearts and minds,\" and clubs for heritage preservation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set also contained other cards such as the jokers that provided additional information about heritage preservation.\n\nOn November 7, 2007, the DoD program, entitled \"In-Theater Heritage Training for Deploying Personnel\", was awarded the \"Chairman's Award\" from the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, an independent federal agency that promotes the preservation, enhancement, and productive use of the United States of America's historic resources, and advises the President and Congress on national historic preservation policy.\n\n\n\n"}

Hutchinson\n\nCharles Lawrence Hutchinson (March 7, 1854 – October 7, 1924) was a prominent Chicago business leader and philanthropist who is best remembered today as the founding and long-time president of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nHutchinson was born in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1854 to Benjamin P. Hutchinson (1828-1899) and Sarah (née Ingalls) Hutchinson (1833-1909), and relocated with his family to Chicago in 1856 after a brief stay in Milwaukee. In Chicago Benjamin Hutchinson founded Chicago Packing & Provision Co., which for many years was the leading meat processor in the United States. In 1863 he became one of the first directors of the First National Bank of Chicago and in 1881 founded the Corn Exchange Bank (with subsequent mergers and acquisitions now Bank of America) and as a member of the Chicago Board of Trade was known as one of the city’s wealthiest and most colorful speculators. Charles graduated from the Chicago public schools in 1872 and entered the business world as a clerk in his father's office, becoming a junior partner with his father in 1875 in the firm B.P. Hutchinson and Son., commission merchants. Although he never attended college, he was a founding trustee and the first treasurer of the University of Chicago, positions he held until his death. He married Frances Angeline Kinsley, daughter of Herbert Milton Kinsley, on May 26, 1881. Herbert Kinsley had, in the last decades of the 19th Century, become one of Chicago’s premier caterers and restaurateurs after having made his reputation during his peripatetic career in part by hosting a ball for the Prince of Wales at the Anglo-American Hotel in Hamilton, Ontario Canada.\n\nBecause of his contributions to the world of philanthropy, art and education Hutchinson was twice awarded honorary degrees by what is today Tufts University, the first one a being a Master of Arts in 1901, and the second one an LL.D in 1920. Hutchinson was also the recipient of an honorary Master of Arts degree by Harvard University in 1915. \nFor his service as consul general for Greece in Chicago during the World's Columbian Exposition, Hutchinson was awarded the Badge of the Order of the Redeemer by King George I of Greece in 1908. He was granted a knighthood by King Albert I of Belgium in 1919 for his work with the Belgian Relief Committee during World War I, and was a supporter of the founding of the League of Nations at the war's end.\n\nHutchinson served as Chairman, Committee of Fine Arts for the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893.\n\n\"Established in 1879 from the remnants of a foundering art academy, the Art Institute of Chicago grew into a sturdy organization largely through the efforts of ... Hutchinson, who served as its president from 1882 to 1924.\" Although Hutchinson’s personal wealth was generated thru banking, grain speculation and meatpacking enterprises that his father had established after coming to Chicago in 1856, Charles L. Hutchinson’s “greatest enthusiasm was for art and the establishment and growth of the Art Institute”. Founded on May 24, 1879 as The Chicago Academy of Fine Arts; The Art Institute assumed its present name in 1882. Hutchinson was a founding trustee of the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, and recognizing his energy and vision, was named by the board of trustees as its first president three years later when it was renamed the Art Institute of Chicago. As one of many accolades conferred on Hutchinson by the Art Institute, the trustees passed a resolution On October 22, 1907 dedicating Gallery 32 as the Charles Lawrence Hutchinson Gallery of Old Masters to commemorate Hutchinson’s twenty-fifth anniversary as president of the institution. After he died in 1924, his obituary notice in \"The Bulletin of the Art Institute\" noted that “His entire life was devoted to public service, but his service to the Art Institute was so intimate, his devotion so complete that it is not possible to measure it. He \"was\" The Art Institute, and it will stand as his most permanent monument”.\n\nCharles L. Hutchinson saw the Art Institute thru every move and building program from the time of its founding until the time of his death in 1924. The institution’s first headquarters were located in Pike's Building at 170 State St. in the rooms of the recently defunct Chicago Academy of Design. They remained there until May 1 of 1882, when Hutchinson recognized that the growth of the organization required a larger facility that featured more artist-friendly accommodation. At that time the group relocated to rooms on the second floor of the D Battery Armory on Michigan Avenue (located just north of where today the Allerton Building of the Art Institute is located). The drive for what was intended to be a permanent facility also began that year when Hutchinson acquired a lot at the southwest corner of Michigan Avenue and VanBuren Street that had built on it a two-story commercial building that was leased in part to a medical college, for which he advanced the Art Institute the purchase price of $45,000. The Art Institute moved its offices into the vacant part of the building, and subsequent to the purchase a three story addition of pressed brick was built on the back portion of the lot. Classes moved from the armory into this new space on January 8, 1883 and these accommodations remained the extent of the Art Institute's real estate holdings until 1885, when the lot to the immediate south was acquired for expansion. Because of the organization's continued rapid growth the medical college building was demolished in 1885 and a new building by John Wellborn Root was built around the 1882 structure to provide more classrooms, galleries and museum space, with a portion of the building set aside for artistically-oriented tenants and organizations whose rent was intended to help pay for the new building and its operations. Contemporary news reports credited the efforts of Hutchinson as being the drive behind the construction of the new building and “the one man to whom the Art Institute owes its splendid status”. \nUnder Hutchinson's watch, plans for expansion of the museum's collection and the building program continued unabated. He used his influence as an organizer of the World's Columbian Exposition to acquire property for a new building for the Art Institute on the east side of Michigan Avenue in Lake Park (today Grant Park) on landfill that had been created with debris from the Great Chicago Fire. On this property was then located a structure that was initially designed and built as a conference center for the fair, but that afterwards became the new home of the Art Institute. It was intended that proceeds from the sale of the VanBuren Street building and $200,000 from the directors of the fair would provide the Art Institute with \"a permanent home for art works which will eclipse everything in the nature of fine structures Chicago has known hitherto\". This new structure (now the Allerton Building) replaced the Exposition Building (built in 1873) that was standing on the site, and was designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, the later of whom was a friend of Hutchinson's having been the architect of Hutchinson Hall at the University of Chicago (1890). The Art Institute moved into the new structure in November 1893 after the fair closed, and Hutchinson spent the next several years leading the effort to reconfigure the interior of the new building. The work entailed the building of the Grand Staircase and the creation of space for the school, libraries, galleries, and the filling of that space with world-class art acquired locally or (more frequently) thru buying expeditions to Europe and Asia. \nAs the Art Institute was not able to provide Hutchinson with the generous purse that would be required for that purpose in those early days, this feat was effected thru Hutchinson's personal connections to Chicago's wealthiest families. An early coup in this regard for Hutchinson and Martin A. Ryerson, a fellow trustee and his frequent companion in these forays, was the 1889 purchase, \"at great sacrifice\" to the seller, of thirteen seventeenth century Dutch paintings that were purchased for $200,000, the money for which was advanced by Marshall Field, Philip Armour and others. \"The New York Press\" sniffed at this effort in what was perceived as an example of Chicago’s cultural barbarism, considering the city’s position as hog butcher to the world and its philistine reputation as a resolute accumulator of wealth for its own sake by whatever means: “He (Hutchinson) probably paid $1,000 a front foot for them, and we assume the citizens of Chicago will give him a triumphal procession when they arrive, carrying them and him in huge floats, drawn by teams of milk-white Berkshire hogs that have been newly washed with a ten inch hose jet of water until their pink flesh shows under the clean bristles.” Hutchinson's connections would serve the Art Institute well over the next few decades. Among the notable additions to the museum's collection acquired through them included bequests by Bertha Palmer, Martin L. Ryerson and Clarence Buckingham, whose gifts would add resources which respectively formed the basis of the museum's notable Impressionist collection and augmented other collections with more than two hundred additional Old Master, Impressionist, and Post-Impressionist paintings and 1,400 Japanese woodblock prints.\nIn 1912 a bridge was built to span the by-then suppressed tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad that ran immediately behind the 1893 building, and in 1916 a two-story structure was built on top of it, funded with a $50,000 donation made by railroad inventor William H. Miner. This structure was named Gunsaulus Hall to honor Frank W. Gunsaulus, museum trustee and the first president of the Armour Institute, and housed the museum's industrial arts and related media collection (the Alsdorf Galleries today occupy the first floor of that space). By 1920 there were talks in earnest regarding the addition of McKlintock Court and the Hutchinson Wing which surrounds it and the Goodman Theater/Goodman School of Drama, which was a gift of the family of the playwright Kenneth S. Goodman, who died in 1918. Ground for the building of the latter pair (by Howard Van Doren Shaw) was broken in 1923 and the theater opened to the public in 1925.\n\nHutchinson believed that a man’s secret of success lie not only in “intense industry”, but also in “his recreations [that] make or break him as surely as do his business habits”. Over the course of his lifetime, Hutchinson was president, board member, trustee and/or supporter of perhaps as many as seventy commercial, civic and philanthropic institutions. Among those were included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Art Institute was never far from Hutchinson’s mind, and on his deathbed he was heard remarking to a friend “I love to lie here and think of it -- of all it will do for the people in the years to come!\" He died at Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago on October 7, 1924 after a brief attack of bronchial pneumonia, at which time he was remembered for the “many official positions [he held] in charitable, philanthropic and educational bodies.” His will provided for generous donations to be made to the Art Institute, including twenty paintings from his private collection including those by Rossetti (\"Beata Beatrix\", 1871/72), Maes (\"Portrait of a Woman\" and \"Portrait of Pierre Corneille\"), Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp (\"Self-Portrait\"), Corot (\"Farm at Seine-et-Oise\"), Daubigny (\"Bords de l’Oise à Anvers\"), Palamedes (\"Portrait of Jan Miclasz Gael\"), Watts (\"Time, Death and Judgement\" and \"Portrait of Joachim\"), Leys (\"Rembrandt's Studio\"), Ranger(\"Noank Shipyard\" and \"Brooklyn Bridge\"), Dupré (\"Cows in Stream\"), Fromentin (\"Arab Boys at Play\"), Teniers (\"Man Lighting a Pipe\"), Dias (\"Wood Interior\" and \"Forest Pool\"), Caspar Netscher (\"Lady at the Mirror\"), Aert van der Neer (\"Winter Sports on the Schie River\") and Hals (\"Portrait of Willem Van Heytheysen\"), as well as a cash bequest in the amount of $95,000 (c. $1,326,000 in 2015). Hutchinson is buried at Chicago's Graceland Cemetery.\n\n\n"}

Since their establishment in 1903, Chetniks had been instrumental to the nationalist and expansionist politics of Serbia. They acted to preserve the centralized Greater Serbian political system within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The historian Vladimir Žerjavić estimates that the Chetniks killed 29,000 Muslims and 18,000 Croats over the course of the war, mostly civilians. The historian Zdravko Dizdar offers a similar figure, stating that 50,000 Muslims and Croats were killed.\n\nHistorians Zdravko Dizdar and Mihajlo Sobolevski divided the criminal methods used by Chetniks into six categories: mass slaughter, rape, burning alive, beheading, impalement, and execution of the wounded. Other methods included hanging, killing with various objects, stoning, maiming, starving, and robbing. Forcible conversions to Orthodoxy took place in prisons such as the internment camp near Knin.\n\nThe surrender of captured Yugoslav Partisans to the Nazis occurred during the November 1941 uprising in Serbia. General Dragoljub (Draža) Mihailović's staff handed 350 captured Partisans to the Nazis, who executed them. During the Chetnik-Partisan conflict in western Serbia, the Chetniks captured over one hundred Partisans. A group of approximately 500 prisoners, including Partisans captured in the towns of Gornji Milanovac, Kosjerić, Karan, and Planinica, were captured by Chetniks in the Ravna Gora mountain range. \n\nAround 13 November 1941, Chetniks took a group of 365 prisoners to the town of Mionica and then to the village of Slovac. They were brought by Nazi and Serbian collaborationist forces to the city of Valjevo. The convoy was secured by Chetnik leader Jovan Škavović Škava. The meeting between Mihailović and the Nazis in the village of Divci (at which they agreed to cooperate) preceded the Partisans' surrender. Of this group of prisoners, the Nazis executed 263 on 27 November 1941 in Krušik, Valjevo; others were later executed, deported to concentration camps, or released.\n\nPartisans were executed on a regular basis: \"Captured 25 Partisans and killed 24 on the site\" (Miloš Erkić, commander of the Tuzla Brigade of the 58th May Corps, to the commanders of the Sember and May brigades on 24 December 1943). Telegram no. 12.425 (No. 486) of 14 December 1943 from He He (Major Radoslav Đurić, commander of the Second Kosovo Corps) reported, \"We broke traitor Lieutenant Radulović and his group. Fighting was conducted by the Second Studen Brigade in the village of Gumništa, where 21 Partisans and nine captives were killed.\n\nThe Bralenovice facility near Danilovgrad, which housed an orphanage before World War II, was used as a concentration camp for Partisans and civilians. The largest imprisonments occurred in April and May 1942. As Jakov N. Jovović wrote in letter number 8 to Baja Stanišić on 30 May 1942, \"489 people, ranging from one year to old men\" were imprisoned in the camp. The number of prisoners was estimated at 610 in August 1942, and ranged between 700 and 1,000 at certain periods. It is estimated that Stanišić killed 426 partisans between April 1942 and September 1943. Chetniks received cash rewards from the Nazis for the capture and execution of Montenegrin partisans.\n\nOn 31 October 1941, Chetniks attacked the hospital of the Pomoravlje Partisan Detachment near the village of Ursule. This attack was part of the general attack by Nazi and Serb collaborationist units on the free Partisan territory of Levača. About ten nurses and fighters from the Levača Unit of the Pomoravlje Partisan Detachment were captured. All the prisoners were taken to Rekovac, redirected to Riljac and Ljubostinje and killed, sent to concentration camps or escaped.\n\nChetniks attacked the Partisan hospital in the village of Gornja Gorevnica, captured eleven partisans, and killed a nurse between 4 and 5 November 1941. The prisoners were taken to Brajići, where they were sentenced to death by a court-martial; the sentence was carried out on 5 November in Brajići.\n\nOn 25 March 1943, Chetnik units of the Dinaric Division were ordered to begin \"cleansing (the area) of Croats and Bosniaks\" and to create \"one national corridor along the Dinara mountain for the connection of Herzegovina with Northern Dalmatia and Lika.\" The Chetniks slaughtered dozens of captured partisans, including renowned Croatian poet Ivan Goran Kovačić, during the Case Black operation in June 1943. The \"1st Mountain Division\" reported: \"Captured 498, of which 411 were executed.\" In Cikota (eastern Bosnia) in mid-July, the Chetniks found 80 wounded Partisans from the First Proletarian Division, seized their weapons, and handed them to the Nazis. The Nazis killed them and burned their bodies. \n\nThat month, Chetniks found wounded partisans from the First and Second Proletarian Brigades in Bišina and handed them over to the Nazis; the wounded partisans were later executed. Chetnik Dragutin Keserović found a partisan hospital in Jastrebac in May 1944, shooting 24 patients and four nurses. The Chetniks discovered another partisan hospital in Semberija that month, killing about 300 seriously-wounded patients. In Krčan, southeast of Udbina, about 90 seriously-wounded Partisans were hiding in 16 houses. They initially hid in the basements with fifteen nurses for ten days after Operation Morgenstern, a joint anti-Partisan offensive of the Wehrmacht, NDH forces and Chetniks in Lika. The region held from 7 to 23 May 1944. Nurses, mostly members of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia from surrounding villages, carried the wounded from the basements to Krčan. A group of Partisans guarded Trnova Poljana, protecting access to Krčan, Kuke, and Visuć from Lapac. Jovo Popović knew about Partisan posts, and brought Chetniks to the village by a roundabout route. They entered Krčan on 2 June 1944 at 10 am, and killed 36 wounded partisans; women and old men hid 56 other wounded partisans. Two doctors (Croat Josip Kajfeš and an Italian named Suppa) were killed, and a Dr. Finderle was wounded. \n\n, Commissar of the 8th Kordun Division, was murdered in Obrad Radočaj's house by Popović. He was later praised by Momčilo Đujić, and received the Star of Obilić.\n\nChetniks terrorized civilians suspected of collaboration with the partisans, intimidating others to discourage partisan support. A suspect's family was often tortured for collaboration with partisans.\n\nIn late December 1943, Draža Mihailović ordered an anti-communist operation south of Belgrade. Colonel Jevrem Simić (general inspector of the Chetnik Detachments) and Nikola Kalabić (commander of the Chetnik Hill Guard Corps) were the main coordinators. After they signed a ceasefire-and-cooperation agreement with the Nazis in the region on 26 November 1943, Chetniks brought their units and began to clear the area.\n\nMihailović's operation lasted from 20 to 21 December. Members of the Smederevo Corps under the command of Živan Lazović killed 72 civilians, nine of whom were children from nine months to 12 years old. This became known as the Vranić Massacre. After the operation, Mihailović reported: \"Terrible inactivity of the elders of Aval Corps. Živan Lazović must come so he could show what could be done.\"\n\nIn January 1943, under Komarčević's command, Chetniks killed 72 partisan supporters in Posavina Srez. In December, Chetnik commander Živan Lazović killed 15 peasant partisan supporters. That month, Chetniks under the command of Nikola Kalabić killed 21 peasants in Kopljare and, under the command of Vuk Kalaitović, shot 18 Partisan supporters in the town of Sjenica. Chetniks under the command of Sveto Bogičević entered Sepci, where they captured Sava Sremečević, Konstantin Vojinović, Ilija Radojević and Ilija Jovanović, in August 1944. After torturing them in an attempt to extract a confession of collaboration with Partisans, they killed all four.\n\n\nThe Partisan newspaper \"Borba\" reported that \"about 2,000 souls\" were \"killed by the Chetniks in Croatian and Muslim villages of Prozor, Konjic, and Vakuf\", and \"the districts of Prozor and Konjic have hundreds of slaughtered and murdered women and children as well as burnt houses.\" Chetnik units under Kosta Pećanac were active throughout the war in Kosovo, committing a number of crimes against the ethnic Albanian population.\n\nChetnik ideologists contended that ethnic cleansing of certain areas was necessary to consolidate an ethnically-\"pure\" Serb territory as a basis of post-war Yugoslavia. The ethnic cleansing was expected to be conducted \"at a convenient moment.\" One of a number of documents that attest to this plan is Mihailović's written memorandum to Pavle Đurišić of 20 December 1941: \n\nThe precondition for creating an ethnically-\"clean\" area was the destruction of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and ethnic cleansing of the region inhabited by Croats and Bosniaks. About \"Homogeneous Serbia\", Stevan Moljević's discourse about his Greater Serbian program, Moljević wrote to Dragiša Vasić in February 1942:\n\nWritten evidence by Chetnik commanders indicates that terrorism against the non-Serb population was intended to establish an ethnically-pure Greater Serbia in the historical territory of other ethnic groups (most notably Croatian and Muslim, but also Bulgarian, Romanian, Hungarian, Macedonian and Montenegrin). Mihailović went further than Moljević and requested over 90 percent of the NDH's territory, where more than 2,500,000 Catholics and over 800,000 Muslims lived (70 percent of the total population, with Orthodox Serbs the remaining 30 percent). Chetnik commander Milan Šantić said in Trebinje in July 1942, \"The Serb lands must be cleansed from Catholics and Muslims. They will be inhabited only by the Serbs. Cleansing will be carried out thoroughly, and we will suppress and destroy them all without exception and without pity, which will be the starting point for our liberation.\"\n\nAccording to a March 1942 document from the Chetnik Dinaric Battalion, the primary Chetnik goal was to create a \"Serbian national state in the areas in which the Serbs live, and even those to which Serbs aspire (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lika and part of Dalmatia)\" where \"only Orthodox population would live\". Bosniaks should realize that the Serbs were their allies, and not join the Partisans. According to Bajo Stanišić, the final goal of the Chetniks was the \"founding of a new Serbian state, not a geographical term but a purely Serbian, with four basic attributes: the Serbian state [Greater Serbia], the Serb King [of] the Karađorđević dynasty, Serbian nationality, and Serbian faith. The Balkan federation is also the next stage, but the main axis and leadership of this federation must be our Serbian state, that is, the Greater Serbia.\"\n\nThe Chetnik leadership saw their \"convenient moment\" in January and February 1943. During this period, Chetniks commanded by Zaharije Ostojić and assisted by Pavle Đurišić and Vojislav Lukačević's units conducted extensive genocidal operations and ethnic cleansing in eastern Bosnia and Sandžak. After they finished, Đurić wrote in a report to Mihailović:\n\nIn late March and April 1943, the Yugoslav Partisans expelled Chetnicks from the region. The German command, equally willing cooperate with Chetnik and Muslim collaborators, later halted the operations. Chetnik planners and ideologists postponed their blueprint for the end of the war. Dragiša Vasić wrote in an April 1942 letter to Mihailović:\n\nA 13 February 1943 letter from the commander of the Ozren Chetnik Corps from to the commander of the Zenica Military-Chetnik Detachment says that the source of Chetnik genocide of Croats and Muslims dates back to the 1882 creation of an independent Serbia:\n\nAt the beginning of August 1945, the first public post-war trial (before the court-martial) was held in liberated Belgrade of Vojislav Lukačević and others. Public prosecutor Miloš Minić accused Lukačević of a massacre in Foča as commander of Chetnik units in Bosnia, participation in the extermination of the Muslim population, collaboration with the Nazis and Milan Nedić, and of crimes against Yugoslav Partisans. Lukačević, found guilty and sentenced to death, was executed in Belgrade in late August 1945.\n\nChetnik leader Dragoljub Mihailović was captured on 13 March 1946 by agents of the Yugoslav Security Agency (OZNA) and indicted on 47 counts. He was convicted of eight, including crimes against humanity and high treason. Mihailović, sentenced to death on 15 July, was executed with nine other Chetnik commanders in Lisičji Potok in the early hours of 18 July 1946.\n\n"}

Closed-source software is maintained by a team who produces their product in a compiled-executable state, which is what the market is allowed access to. Microsoft, the owner and developer of Windows and Microsoft Office, along with other major software companies, have long been proponents of this business model, although in August 2010, Microsoft interoperability general manager Jean Paoli said Microsoft \"loves open source\" and its anti-open-source position was a mistake.\n\nThe FOSS model allows for able users to view and modify a product's source code, but most of such code is not in the public domain. Common advantages cited by proponents for having such a structure are expressed in terms of trust, acceptance, teamwork and quality.\n\nA non-free license is used to limit what free software movement advocates consider to be the essential freedoms. A license, whether providing open-source code or not, that does not stipulate the \"four software freedoms\", are not considered \"free\" by the free software movement. A closed source license is one that limits only the availability of the source code. By contrast a copyleft license claims to protect the \"four software freedoms\" by explicitly granting them and then explicitly prohibiting anyone to redistribute the package or reuse the code in it to make derivative works without including the same licensing clauses. Some licenses grant the four software freedoms but allow redistributors to remove them if they wish. Such licenses are sometimes called \"permissive software licenses\". An example of such a license is the FreeBSD License which allows derivative software to be distributed as non-free or closed source, as long as they give credit to the original designers.\n\nA misconception that is often made by both proponents and detractors of FOSS is that it cannot be capitalized. FOSS can and has been commercialized by companies such as Red Hat, Canonical, Mozilla, Google, IBM, Novell, Sun/Oracle, VMware and others.\n\nThe primary business model for closed-source software involves the use of constraints on what can be done with the software and the restriction of access to the original source code. This can result in a form of imposed artificial scarcity on a product that is otherwise very easy to copy and redistribute. The end result is that an end-user is not actually purchasing software, but purchasing the right to use the software. To this end, the source code to closed-source software is considered a trade secret by its manufacturers.\n\nFOSS methods, on the other hand, typically do not limit the use of software in this fashion. Instead, the revenue model is based mainly on support services. Red Hat Inc. and Canonical Ltd. are such companies that give its software away freely, but charge for support services. The source code of the software is usually given away, and pre-compiled binary software frequently accompanies it for convenience. As a result, the source code can be freely modified. However, there can be some license-based restrictions on re-distributing the software. Generally, software can be modified and re-distributed for free, as long as credit is given to the original manufacturer of the software. In addition, FOSS can generally be sold commercially, as long as the source-code is provided. There are a wide variety of free software licenses that define how a program can be used, modified, and sold commercially (see GPL, LGPL, and BSD-type licenses). FOSS may also be funded through donations.\n\nA software philosophy that combines aspects of FOSS and proprietary software is open core software, or commercial open source software. Despite having received criticism from some proponents of FOSS, it has exhibited marginal success. Examples of open core software include MySQL and VirtualBox. The MINIX operating system used to follow this business model, but came under the full terms of the BSD license after the year 2000.\n\nThis model has proved somewhat successful, as witnessed in the Linux community. There are numerous GNU/Linux distributions available, but a great many of them are simply modified versions of some previous version. For example, Fedora Linux, Mandriva Linux, and PCLinuxOS are all derivatives of an earlier product, Red Hat Linux. In fact, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is itself a derivative of Fedora Linux. This is an example of one vendor creating a product, allowing a third-party to modify the software, and then creating a tertiary product based on the modified version. All of the products listed above are currently produced by software service companies.\n\nOperating systems built on the Linux kernel are available for a wider range of processor architectures than Microsoft Windows, including PowerPC and SPARC. None of these can match the sheer popularity of the x86 architecture, nevertheless they do have significant numbers of users; Windows remains unavailable for these alternative architectures, although there have been such ports of it in the past.\n\nThe most obvious complaint against FOSS revolves around the fact that making money through some traditional methods, such as the sale of the use of individual copies and patent royalty payments, is much more difficult and sometimes impractical with FOSS. Moreover, FOSS has been considered damaging to the commercial software market, evidenced in documents released as part of the Microsoft Halloween documents leak.\n\nThe cost of making a copy of a software program is essentially zero, so per-use fees are perhaps unreasonable for open-source software. At one time, open-source software development was almost entirely volunteer-driven, and although this is true for many small projects, many alternative funding streams have been identified and employed for FOSS:\n\n\nIncreasingly, FOSS is developed by commercial organizations. In 2004, Andrew Morton noted that 37,000 of the 38,000 recent patches in the Linux kernel were created by developers directly paid to develop the Linux kernel. Many projects, such as the X Window System and Apache, have had commercial development as a primary source of improvements since their inception. This trend has accelerated over time.\n\nThere are some who counter that the commercialization of FOSS is a poorly devised business model because commercial FOSS companies answer to parties with opposite agendas. On one hand commercial FOSS companies answer to volunteers developers, who are difficult to keep on a schedule, and on the other hand they answer to shareholders, who are expecting a return on their investment. Often FOSS development is not on a schedule and therefore it may have an adverse effect on a commercial FOSS company releasing software on time.\n\nGary Hamel counters this claim by saying that quantifying who or what is innovative is impossible.\n\nThe implementation of compatible FOSS replacements for proprietary software is encouraged by the Free Software Foundation to make it possible for their users to use FOSS instead of proprietary software, for example they have listed GNU Octave, an API-compatible replacement for MATLAB, as one of their high priority projects. In the past this list contained free binary compatible Java and CLI implementations, like GNU Classpath and DotGNU. Thus even \"derivative\" developments are important in the opinion of many people from FOSS. However, there is no quantitative analysis, if FOSS is less innovative than proprietary software, since there are derivative/re-implementing proprietary developments, too.\n\nSome of the largest well-known FOSS projects are either legacy code (e.g., FreeBSD or Apache) developed a long time ago independently of the free software movement, or by companies like Netscape (which open-sourced its code with the hope that they could compete better), or by companies like MySQL which use FOSS to lure customers for its more expensive licensed product. However, it is notable that most of these projects have seen major or even complete rewrites (in the case of the Mozilla and Apache 2 code, for example) and do not contain much of the original code.\n\nInnovations have come, and continue to come, from the open-source world:\n\nAn analysis of the code of the FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, and Windows operating system kernels looked for differences between code developed using open-source properties (the first two kernels) and proprietary code (the other two kernels). The study collected metrics in the areas of file organization, code structure, code style, the use of the C preprocessor, and data organization. The aggregate results indicate that across various areas and many different metrics, four systems developed using open- and closed-source development processes score comparably.\nThe study mentioned above is refuted by a study conducted by Coverity, Inc finding open source code to be of better quality.\n\nA study was done on seventeen open-source and closed-source software showed that the number of vulnerabilities existing in a piece of software is not affected by the source availability model that it uses. The study used a very simple metrics of comparing the number of vulnerabilities between the open-source and closed-source software. Another study was also done by a group of professors in Northern Kentucky University on fourteen open-source web applications written in PHP. The study measured the vulnerability density in the web applications and shown that some of them had increased vulnerability density, but some of them also had decreased vulnerability density.\n\nIn its 2008 Annual Report, Microsoft stated that FOSS business models challenge its license-based software model and that the firms who use these business models do not bear the cost for their software development. The company also stated in the report:\nThere are numerous business models for open source companies which can be found in the literature.\n\n"}

For example, 'brother' is \"kardeş,\" and 'dog' is \"köpek,\" but 'brother's dog' is \"kardeşin köpeği.\" (The consonant change is part of a regular consonant mutation.)\n\nAnother example is a language in which endings that mark gender or case are used to indicate the role of both nouns and their associated modifiers (such as adjectives) in a sentence (such as Russian and Spanish) or in which case endings are supplemented by verb endings marking the subject, direct object and/or indirect object of a sentence.\n\nProto-Indo-European had double-marking in both verb phrases (verbs were marked for person and number, nominals for case) and noun-adjective phrases (both marked with the same case-and-number endings) but not in possessive phrases (only the dependent was marked).\n\n"}

It holds one of the world's leading collections of European paintings from the 13th to the 18th centuries. Its collection includes masterpieces from such artists as Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach, Hans Holbein, Rogier van der Weyden, Jan van Eyck, Raphael, Botticelli, Titian, Caravaggio, Giambattista Pittoni, Peter Paul Rubens, David Teniers the Younger, Rembrandt, Johannes Vermeer, and Antonio Viviani. It was first opened in 1830, and the current building was completed in 1998. It is located in the Kulturforum museum district west of Potsdamer Platz.\n\nThe Gemäldegalerie prides itself on its scientific methodology in collecting and displaying art. Each room can be taken in as a single statement about one to five artists in a certain period or following a certain style. The German collection is the finest and most comprehensive in the world, rivalled only by Vienna and Munich, and the Early Netherlandish and Italian collections also exceptionally comprehensive. The holdings of Spanish, French and British art are much smaller. Especially notable rooms include the octagonal Rembrandt room and a room containing five different Madonnas by Raphael.\n\nThere are two paintings by Vermeer in the collection, \"The Wine Glass\" and\" Woman with a Pearl Necklace\".\n\nOther notable experiences include Flemish moralistic paintings which stretch across the north side of the museum, showing an interplay between the religious motives of the artists' patrons and the often sensual inspirations of the artists. In the Renaissance section, for example, Caravaggio's \"Amor Victorious\" is displayed alongside Giovanni Baglione's \"Sacred Love Versus Profane Love\". The two paintings are historically connected; after hearing of the scandalous portrayal of the theme \"love conquers all\" in Caravaggio's work, a Roman bishop commissioned Baglione's reply, which mimics Carvaggio's style, including the features of \"Amor\".\n\nThe current gallery sits in the southwest corner of the Kulturforum, a modern-styled answer to the old Museumsinsel (Museum Island). The gallery was designed by Munich architects Heinz Hilmer and Christoph Sattler. The building consists of 72 rooms providing a two-kilometer (1.25 mi) floor. Upstairs the rooms flow around a large central hall, described by the museum as a \"meditation hall\". The hall sometimes displays sculpture, but is mostly empty, allowing easy crossing between rooms, and somewhere for school parties to sit. There are also works downstairs, a gallery devoted to frames, and a digital gallery.\n\nThe collection is arranged more or less chronologically starting from the entrance and moving toward the farthest room; however there are many doors back to the long central space, so it is straightforward to reach any other room at any point. The visitor chooses between southern, mainly Italian, art to the left, and German and Flemish art to the right. Completing the circuit takes the visitor first forward, then backward, in time. The numbering system starting on the north side of the museum covers mostly Northern European art, then British art. A visitor following along the southern side will go through mostly Italian and Southern European art. The main floor galleries contain some 850 works in 53 rooms, with around 400 more in several rooms off a corridor downstairs, which are also open to visitors.\n\nUnlike most major national European collections (with the exception of the National Gallery, London), the Gemäldegalerie collection is not essentially formed around the former dynastic royal collection, but created by a process of acquisition by the Prussian government beginning in 1815. From the first the museum was intended to reflect the full range of European art, giving a different emphasis from that of older royal collections, including the royal collection of Saxony, now mostly in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, the finest German princely collection, which like other royal collections is strongest in Italian art.\nThe collection was first opened to the public in 1830, on completion of construction of the Royal Museum, now called the Altes Museum (\"Old Museum\"), designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel and sited by the Lustgarten opposite the Royal Palace on the other side of Unter den Linden. The paintings occupied the upper floor with the collection of antiquities on the lower. At this point the collection contained nearly 1200 paintings, with a core of 160 from the 17th century collection of Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, bought in Paris in 1815. An even more important purchase was 677 paintings from the collection formed in Berlin by the English merchant Edward Solly was acquired in 1821; Solly was an early collector of Italian Trecento and Quattrocento paintings and Early Netherlandish painting. Purchases continued throughout the 19th century, with 345 works acquired during the inaugural directorship of Gustav Friedrich Waagen from 1830–1868, though paintings competed with antiquities for rather reduced purchasing budgets. \nAfter Berlin became the capital of the new German Empire in 1871 the funds available greatly increased, and purchases accelerated, as Berlin strove to catch up with the greatest European collections. In 1874 the collection acquired the best of the collection of mostly north European art formed by the industrialist Barthold Suermondt of Aachen after his business collapsed. This was handled for the museum by the art historian Wilhelm von Bode, who had joined in 1872, and was to be the Berlin Museums' greatest Director. He headed the sculpture collections from 1883, then the paintings from 1890, becoming general head of the Berlin Museums from 1890 to 1920. A specialist in Rembrandt and Dutch painting, he made very significant additions in those areas, but did not neglect Italian painting. His leadership marked the rise of the Gemäldegalerie to international prominence.\nIn 1904 the Gemäldegalerie moved to the newly built Kaiser Friedrich Museum, now the Bode Museum, where the collection continued to expand. The museum was badly damaged during World War II, but most of the collection survived the war in shelters across Germany. At the end of the war, however, 400 works that were regarded as too large to take to the remoter hiding places were destroyed in a fire in a Flak tower that served as a bomb shelter. Many important altarpieces and other large works were lost, and the collection remains short of very large works compared to the other major European collections. Furthermore, several hundred paintings were looted by Russian or American soldiers or confiscated by the Red Army and never returned, although in June 2006 a small painting by Alessandro Allori, missing since 1944, was returned by the British journalist Charles Wheeler, who had picked it up at the end of the war in Berlin. The surviving collection was divided between East Berlin (mostly at the Bode Museum on Museumsinsel) and West Berlin in Berlin-Dahlem, where from the 1950s they were housed in a building originally used for the Asiatic collections, built in 1923, with post-war additions.\n\nPurchases for the West Berlin collection eventually resumed after the war, with Dutch Golden Age painting, Italian Baroque painting, and the creation of a small section for English painting being priorities for successive directors before the Re-unification of Germany. In 1992 the museum administrations of East and West were re-united, but uniting the collections physically took longer. The current building on the Kulturforum was completed in 1998, and displays some 1,250 paintings, although yet another move currently seems likely (see below). Other works are displayed elsewhere, as the museum forms part of the Berlin State Museums and does not own a distinct collection as most museums do. For example, \"L'Enseigne de Gersaint\", or \"Gersaint's Shopsign\", (1720), a famous painting by Jean-Antoine Watteau, is displayed with other works in the appropriate setting of Charlottenburg Palace. The whole collection of Old Master Western paintings in the Berlin State Museums is usually said to be around 3,000.\n\n, the gallery's collection faces a pending move to a temporary site on Berlin's Museumsinsel, to make room for the expansion of the Neue Nationalgalerie and the 20th-century collection of Ulla and Heiner Pietzsch, bequeathed on condition that it be displayed in its entirety. The proposal has provoked controversy and criticism, particularly since there are no permanent plans for a new structure that would house the collection in its full scope.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "251306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=251306", "title": "Getica", "text": "Getica\n\nDe origine actibusque Getarum (\"The Origin and Deeds of the Getae/Goths\"), or the Getica, written in Late Latin by Jordanes (or \"Iordanes/Jornandes\") in or shortly after 551 AD, claims to be a summary of a voluminous account by Cassiodorus of the origin and history of the Gothic people, which is now lost. However, the extent to which Jordanes actually used the work of Cassiodorus is unknown. It is significant as the only remaining contemporaneous resource that gives the full story of the origin and history of the Goths. Another aspect of this work is its information about the early history and the customs of Slavs.\n\nThe \"Getica\" begins with a geography/ethnography of the North, especially of Scandza (16-24). He lets the history of the Goths commence with the emigration of Berig with three ships from Scandza to Gothiscandza (25, 94), in a distant past. In the pen of Jordanes (or Cassiodorus), Herodotus' Getian demi-god Zalmoxis becomes a king of the Goths (39). Jordanes tells how the Goths sacked \"Troy and Ilium\" just after they had recovered somewhat from the war with Agamemnon (108). They are also said to have encountered the Egyptian pharaoh Vesosis (47). The less-fictional part of Jordanes' work begins when the Goths encounter Roman military forces in the 3rd century AD. The work concludes with the defeat of the Goths by the Byzantine general Belisarius. Jordanes concludes the work by stating that he writes to honour those who were victorious over the Goths after a history of 2030 years.\n\nBecause the original work of Cassiodorus has not survived, the work of Jordanes is one of the most important sources for the period of the migration of the European tribes, and the Ostrogoths and Visigoths in particular, from the 3rd century CE. Cassiodorus had claimed to have the Gothic \"folk songs\" — \"carmina prisca\" (Latin) — as an important source; recent scholarship regards this as highly questionable. Its main purpose was to give the Gothic ruling class a glorious past, to match the past of the senatorial families of Roman Italy.\n\nJordanes stated that Getae are the same as the Goths, on the testimony of Orosius Paulus. A controversial passage identifies the ancient people of Venedi mentioned by Tacitus, Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy, with the Slavs of the 6th century. As early as 1844, it has been used by eastern European scholars to support the idea of the existence of a Slavic ethnicity long before the last phase of the Late Roman period. Others have rejected this view, based on the absence of concrete archaeological and historiographical data.\n\nThe book is important to some medieval historians because it mentions the campaign in Gaul of one Riothamus, \"King of the Brettones,\" who was a possible source of inspiration for the early stories of King Arthur.\n\nOne of the major questions concerning the historicity of the work is whether the identities mentioned are as ancient as stated or date from a later time. The evidence allows a wide range of views, the most skeptical being that the work is mainly mythological, or if Jordanes did exist and is the author, that he describes peoples of the 6th century only. According to the latter, his main source's credibility is questionable for a number of reasons. First, the originality of his main source, Cassiodorus, is debatable because large part of it consists of culling of ancient Greek and Latin authors for descriptions of peoples who \"might\" have been Goths. Not only that but it seems that Jordanes has distorted Cassiodorus's narrative by presenting us a cursory abridgement of the latter, mixed with 6th century ethnic names.\n\nSome scholars claim, that while acceptance of Jordanes at face value may be too naive, a totally skeptical view is not warranted. For example, Jordanes says that the Goths originated in Scandinavia 1490 BC. Austrian historian Herwig Wolfram, believes that there might be a kernel of truth in that claim, if we assume that a clan of the Gutae left Scandinavia long before the establishment of the Amali in the leadership of the Goths. This clan might have contributed to the ethnogenesis of the Gutones in east Pomerania (see Wielbark culture). Another example is the name of the king Cniva which David S. Potter thinks is genuine because, since it doesn't appear in the fictionalized genealogy of Gothic kings given by Jordanes, he must have found it in a genuine 3rd-century source.\n\nDanish scholar Arne Søby Christensen on the other hand claims that the \"Getica\" was an entirely fabricated account, and that the origin of the Goths in the book is a construction based on popular Greek and Roman myths as well as a misinterpretation of recorded names from Northern Europe. The purpose of this fabrication, according to Christensen, was to establish a glorious identity for the peoples that had recently gained power in post-Roman Europe. Canadian scholar Walter Goffart suggests another incentive: \"Getica\" was part of a conscious plan by emperor Justinian and the propaganda machine at his court. He wanted to affirm that Goths (and their barbarian cousins) did not belong to the Roman world, thus justifying the claims of the Eastern Roman Empire to the western part of the latter.\n\nThe migration of the Goths from Scandinavia however bears some similarities with the story of the Gutasaga, which tells of an emigration that is associated with the historical migration of the Goths during the Migration period:\n\n\"This Thielvar had a son called Hafthi. And Hafthi's wife was called Whitestar. Those two were the first to settle on Gotland. The first night they slept together she dreamt that three snakes were coiled in her lap. And it seemed to her that they slid out of her lap. She told this dream to her husband Hafthi. He interpreted it thus:\n\n\"\"All is bound with bangles,\n\"it will be inhabited, this land,\n\"and we shall have three sons.\"\n\n\"While still unborn, he gave them all names:\n\n\"\"Guti will own Gotland,\n\"Graip will be the second,\n\"and Gunfiaun third.\"\n\n\"These later divided Gotland into three parts, so that Graip the eldest got the northern third, Guti the middle third, and Gunfjaun the youngest had the south. Then, over a long time, the people descended from these three multiplied so much that the land couldn't support them all. So they selected every third person by lot to leave, with the right to keep and take away with them everything they owned except for their land. They were unwilling to leave then, but went to instead Torsburgen and settled there. But afterwards the country (i.e. Gotland) would not tolerate them, and drove them away.\n\n\"Then they went away to Fårö and settled there. They couldn't support themselves in that place, so they went to a certain island off the coast of Estland, called Dagö, and settled there and built a town that can still be seen. But they couldn't support themselves there either, so they went up the river Dvina, up through Russia. They went so far that they came to the land of the Greeks (i.e. the Byzantine empire). They asked leave of the Greek king to stay there while the moon waxed and waned. The king granted that, thinking it was just for one month. Then after a month, he wanted to send them away, but they answered that the moon waxed and waned for ever and always, and so they said they were allowed to stay. Word of this dispute of theirs reached the queen. She said, \"My lord king, you granted them permission to dwell while the moon waxed and waned; now that's for ever and always, so you can't take it off them.\" So they settled there, and live there still, and still have something of our language.\"\n\nThat the Goths should have gone \"to the land of the Greeks\" is consistent with their first appearance in classical sources: Eusebius of Caesarea reported that they devastated \"Macedonia, Greece, the Pontus, and Asia\" in 263.\n\nThe emigration would have taken place in the 1st century AD, and loose contact with their homeland would have been maintained for another two centuries, the comment that the emigrant's language \"still has something\" in common shows awareness of dialectal separation. The events would have needed to be transmitted orally for almost a millennium before the text was written down.\n\nThe mention of the Dvina river is in good agreement with the Wielbark Culture. Historically, the Goths followed the Vistula, but during the Viking Age, the Dvina-Dniepr waterway succeeded the Vistula as the main trade route to Greece for the \"Gutes\" (or \"Gotar\" in standard Old Norse), and it is not surprising that it also replaced the Vistula in the migration traditions.\n\nA manuscript of the text was rediscovered in Vienna in 1442 by the Italian humanist Enea Silvio Piccolomini. Its \"editio princeps\" was issued in 1515 by Konrad Peutinger, followed by many other editions.\n\nThe classic edition is that of 19th-century German classical scholar Theodor Mommsen (in \"Monumenta Germaniae Historica\", \"auctores antiqui\", v. ii.). The best surviving manuscript was the \"Heidelberg manuscript\", written in Heidelberg, Germany, probably in the 8th century, but this was destroyed in a fire at Mommsen's house on July 7, 1880. Subsequently, another 8th-century manuscript was discovered, containing chapters I to XLV, and is now the 'Codice Basile' at the Archivio di Stato in Palermo. The next of the manuscripts in historical value are the \"Vaticanus Palatinus\" of the 10th century, and the \"Valenciennes manuscript\" of the 9th century.\n\nJordanes' work had been well known prior to Mommsen's 1882 edition. It was cited in Edward Gibbon's classic 6 volumes of \"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1776), and had been earlier mentioned by Degoreus Whear (1623) who refers to both Jordanes' \"De regnorum ac temporum successione\" and to \"De rebus Geticis\".\n\nIn his Preface, Jordanes presents his plan\nJordanes admits that he did not then have direct access to Cassiodorus's book, and could not remember the exact words, but that he felt confident that he had retained the substance in its entirety.</ref> He goes on to say that he added relevant passages from Latin and Greek sources, composed the Introduction and Conclusion, and inserted various things of his own authorship. Due to this mixed origin, the text has been examined in an attempt to sort out the sources for the information it presents.\n\nFormer notarius to a Gothic magister militum Gunthigis, Jordanes would have been in a position to know traditions concerning the Gothic peoples without necessarily relying on anyone else. However, there is no evidence for this in the text, and some of the instances where the work refers to \"carmina prisca\" can be shown to depend on classical authors.\n\nCassiodorus was a native Italian (Squillace, Bruttium), who rose to become advisor and secretary to the Gothic kings in various high offices. His and the Goths' most successful years were perhaps the reign of Theodoric. The policy of Theodoric's government at that time was reconciliation and in that spirit he incorporated Italians into the government whenever he could. He asked Cassiodorus to write a work on the Goths that would, in essence, demonstrate their antiquity, nobility, experience and fitness to rule.\n\nTheodoric died in 526 and Cassiodorus went on to serve his successors in the same capacity. He had not by any means forgotten the task assigned to him by his former king. In 533 a letter ostensibly written by King Athalaric to the senate in Rome, but ghosted by Cassiodorus, mentions the great work on the Goths, now complete, in which Cassiodorus \"\"restored the Amali with the illustriousness of their race\".\"\nThe work must have been written at Ravenna, seat of the Gothic kings, between 526 at latest and 533.\n\nWhat Cassiodorus did with the manuscripts after that remains unknown. The fact that Jordanes once obtained them from a steward indicates that the wealthy Cassiodorus was able to hire at least one full-time custodian of them and other manuscripts of his; i.e., a private librarian (a custom not unknown even today).\n\nJordanes says in the preface to \"Getica\" that he obtained them from the librarian for three days in order to read them again (relegi). The times and places of these readings have been the concern of many scholars, as this information possibly bears on how much of \"Getica\" is based on Cassiodorus.\n\nThere are two main theories, one expressed by the Mierow source below, and one by the O'Donnell source below. Mierow's is earlier and does not include a letter cited by O'Donnell.\n\nGothic sovereignty came to an end with the reconquest of Italy by Belisarius, military chief of staff for Justinian, ending in 539. Cassiodorus' last ghost writing for the Gothic kings was done for Witiges, who was removed to Constantinople in 540. A number of token kings ruled from there while Belisarius established that the Goths were not going to reinvade and retake Italy (which was however taken again by the Lombards after Justinian's death).\n\nCassiodorus retired in 540 to his home town of Squillace, where he used his wealth to build a monastery with school and library, \"Vivarium\".\n\nThe events, persons and peoples of \"Getica\" are put forward as being up to many centuries prior to the time of Jordanes. Taken at face value, they precede any other history of Scandinavia.\n\nJordanes does cite some writers well before his time, to whose works he had access but we do not, and other writers whose works are still extant. Mierow gives a summary of these, which is reviewed below, and also states other authors he believed were used by Jordanes but were not cited in \"Getica\" (refer to the Mierow source cited below). Mierow's list of cited authors is summarized as follows:\n\n\nThe early Late Latin of Jordanes evidences a certain variability in the structure of the language which has been taken as an indication that the author no longer had a clear standard of correctness. Jordanes tells us in \"Getica\" that he interrupted work on the \"Romana\" to write \"Getica\", and then finished \"Romana\". Jordanes states in \"Romana\" that he wrote it in the 24th year of the emperor Justinian, which began April 1, 551. In \"Getica\" he mentions a plague of nine years previous. This is probably the Plague of Justinian, that began in Egypt in 541, reached Constantinople in 542 and went on to Italy in 543. The time is too early to identify a direction of change toward any specific Romance language, as none had appeared yet. This variability, however, preceded the appearance of the first French, Italian, Spanish, Romanian, etc. After those languages developed, the scholastics gradually restored classical Latin as a means of scholarly communication.\n\nJordanes refers to himself as \"agrammaticus\" before his conversion. This obscure statement is sometimes taken to refer to his Latin. Variability, however, characterizes all Late Latin, and besides, the author was not writing just after his conversion (for the meaning of the latter, see under Jordanes), but a whole career later, after associating with many Latin speakers and having read many Latin books. According to him, he should have been grammaticus by that time. More likely, his style reflects the way Latin was under the Goths.\n\nSome of the variabilities are as follows (Mierow):\n\nOrthography. The spelling of many words differs from the classical, which Jordanes would certainly have known. For example, Grecia replaces Graecia; Eoropam, Europam; Atriatici, Adriatici.\n\nInflection. Substantives migrate between declensions; verbs between conjugations. Some common changes are fourth to second (lacu to laco), second declension adjective to third (magnanimus to magnanimis), i-stems to non-i-stems (mari to mare in the ablative). Gender may change. Verbs may change voice.\n\nOne obvious change in a modern direction is the indeclinability of many formerly declined nouns, such as corpus. Also, the -m accusative ending disappears, leaving the preceding vowel or replacing it with -o (Italian, Romanian), as in Danubio for Danubium.\n\nSyntax. Case variability and loss of agreement in prepositional phrases (inter Danubium Margumque fluminibus), change of participial tense (egressi .. et transeuntes), loss of subjunctive in favor of indicative, loss of distinction between principal and subordinate clauses, confusion of subordinating conjunctions.\n\nSemantics. A different vocabulary appears: \"germanus\" for \"frater\", \"proprius\" for \"suus\", \"civitas\" for \"urbs\", \"pelagus\" for \"mare\", etc.\n\n"}

Despite historical cooperation between Ghana and the United States, the proposal was controversial due to concerns (raised primarily by the National Democratic Congress party) that the agreement would offer undue privileges to the United States, including a particularly controversial permission to build a United States military base in Ghana. The President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, has denied that the agreement would give the United States permission to build a military base in Ghana.\n\nGhana and the United States of America have had a cordial bilateral relationship since Ghana's independence on 6 March 1957. Ghana has cooperated with the U.S. in a wide variety of fields, including education, aviation, agricultural commodities, extradition, telecommunications, defence, economic and technical support.\n\nIn 1961, Ghana was the first country in which the United States have deployed Peace Corps personnel, after President John F. Kennedy issued an executive order to establish an agency within the Department of State. Since then, the two countries have engaged in joint military cooperation and exchange programs. A recent example of this occurred when Ghanaian Military forces, which had trained in jungle warfare for the past four decades, aided the regionally aligned forces of United States Army Africa in a jungle warfare training exercise in Achiase Military Base, Ghana.\n\nThe main opposition party in Ghana, the National Democratic Congress, raised concerns that the deal provided one-sided benefits to the United States. It emerged afterward that the government of Ghana had agreed to a similar Military Agreement in 1998 and again in 2015 under the leadership of the National Democratic Congress. The NDC denied these claims, and stated that should the NDC be elected back into power in 2020, they would withdraw from the SOFA agreement.\n\nThe Opposition party National Democratic Congress registered their displeasure against some of the terms of the Agreement which give unfettered access to Ghana's resources to their US counterparts. Among some of which the US Department of Defense requested from the Nana Akuffo-Addo led New Patriotic Party Government, which the opposition party deems contentious and must be renegotiated are:\n\n\nThe most contentious clause is the one that states \" The United States Forces may undertake construction activities, and make alterations and improvements to, agreed facilities and areas\". This was largely interpreted by the opposition party and security experts as a request for setting up a Military Base in the country, which the Government vehemently denied.\n\nAfter easily getting cabinet approval, the agreement was sent to the Parliament of Ghana for ratification. The agreement was brought before the House for consideration and ratification after the joint-committee on Defense and Interior Constitutional, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs of Parliament gave it a green light. The minority leader Haruna Iddrisu expressed his reservations on the floor of Parliament House to convince the speaker, Aaron Mike Oquaye to rescind his decision on laying the document before the House. His request was denied and he and his colleagues walked out to express their disapproval of the Agreement.\n\nA section of the population and civil societies also registered their displeasure against the Military Agreement. Notable among them is the Ghana First Patriotic Front (GFPF). They organized a peaceful protest in the national capital to declare their dissatisfaction with the Agreement . The Ghana Federation of Labour also appealed to the President to expunge some of the clauses enshrined in the document, which they said are not in the best interests of the country .\n\nIn response, President Nana Akufo-Addo stated on national television that the military agreement did not approve construction of a future military base, and further added that his government will not consider any such request. \n\nVarious Ghanaian intellectuals and politicians have voiced concerns and opposition to the military agreement, including former president Jerry Rawlings, MP Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, and Bright Simons. Chief among their concerns is that the agreement will impede Ghanaian self-sovereignty. Some commentators specifically voiced concerns that the United States was seeking to use the agreement to take control of Ghana's and Africa's natural resources, particularly oil reserves.\n\n"}

The purpose of Global Information Governance Day is to raise the awareness of information governance. The holiday was created by Garth Landers, Tamir Sigal, and Barclay T. Blair in 2012.\n\nInformation governance is the enforcement of desirable behavior in the creation, use, archiving, and deletion of corporate information. Gartner Inc., an information technology research and advisory firm, defines information governance as the specification of decision rights and an accountability framework to encourage desirable behavior in the valuation, creation, storage, use, archival and deletion of information. It includes the processes, roles, standards and metrics that ensure the effective and efficient use of information in enabling an organization to achieve its goals.\n\nFebruary is Information Governance Month, coordinated by the American Health Information Management Association.\n\nThe celebration is coordinated and promoted by information governance experts.\nRecords management deals with the retention and disposition of records. A record can either be a physical, tangible object, or digital information such as a database, application data, and e-mail. The lifecycle was historically viewed as the point of creation to the eventual disposal of a record. As content generation exploded in recent decades, and regulations and compliance issues increased, traditional records management failed to keep pace. A more comprehensive platform for managing records and information became necessary to address all phases of the lifecycle, which led to the advent of information governance.\n\nInformation governance goes beyond retention and disposition to include privacy, access controls, and other compliance issues. In electronic discovery, or e-discovery, electronically stored information is searched for relevant data by attorneys and placed on legal hold. IG includes consideration of how this content is held and controlled for e-discovery, and also provides a platform for defensible disposition and compliance. Additionally, metadata often accompanies electronically stored data and can be of great value to the enterprise if stored and managed correctly.\n\nWith all of these additional considerations that go beyond traditional records management, IG emerged as a platform for organizations to define policies at the enterprise level, across multiple jurisdictions. IG then also provides for the enforcement of these policies into the various repositories of information, data, and records.\n\nInformation governance was given national recognition in November, 2011 with a directive from President Obama to overhaul current records management processes within the government to encompass current needs more comprehensively.\n\nInformation governance has been a growing trend, even becoming the theme of the annual ARMA International Conference in 2012. While Records Managers are becoming aware of IG, there is still little awareness among many organizations. Global Information Governance Day was established in 2013 to raise this awareness.\n\n\n"}

He is the son of wrestler Johnny Valentine.\n\nIn the course of his career, which has spanned over four decades, Valentine has held more than 40 championships, including the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship, WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship and WWF World Tag Team Championship. An alumnus of Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2004 and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nBorn in Seattle, Washington, Wisniski traveled around Texas in his teens with his father; Johnny Valentine. During a summer vacation, he decided to drop out of college and become a wrestler. His father initially tried to deter him, but eventually ceded to his wishes and sent him to Canada in 1970 to train under Stu Hart in Calgary.\n\nWisniski was trained to wrestle by Stu Hart, wrestling his debut match in July 1970 against Angelo \"King Kong\" Mosca (he lost in around five minutes). Six months later, Wisniski relocated to Detroit to complete his training under the Sheik.\n\nInitially reluctant to take his father's ring name, Wisniski wrestled as Baby Face Nelson before becoming Johnny Fargo, one half of the Fargo Brothers with Don Fargo between 1971 and 1974. The Fargo Brothers initially competed in the Buffalo and Cleveland based National Wrestling Federation before moving on to Texas. They split in 1974 and Wisniski went to Florida, where he began performing as Johnny Valentine Jr., hopeful that he could live up to his father's legacy. He later changed his ring name to Greg \"the Hammer\" Valentine, and was billed as Johnny Valentine's brother, not his son, because of fears that the elder Valentine would be thought of as too old to be a legitimate threat. Valentine remained in Florida for a year while also working in Los Angeles and in Japan under Antonio Inoki in 1975 and early 1976.\n\nIn August 1976, Valentine debuted in Jim Crockett Jr. and George Scott's Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, an affiliate of the National Wrestling Alliance based in the Carolinas and Virginias. Valentine was hired to replace his father, who had been forced to retire after he broke his back in a plane crash in 1975. He immediately began feuding with Johnny Weaver, who he \"retired\" with a top rope elbow drop. Valentine's elbow drop was promoted as a deadly move, with tapes of him breaking wooden boards with his elbow shown to the audiences before his debut.\n\nValentine then formed a tag team with Ric Flair, with whom he twice won the NWA World tag team title and held the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship (between June 30 and August 22, 1977). They first defeated Gene and Ole Anderson on December 26, 1976 (who nine years later would become in storyline Flair's \"cousins\") in Greensboro, injuring Gene so badly that he had to be stretchered out. They held the titles until May 8, 1977, when the Andersons defeated them in a steel cage match in the old Charlotte Coliseum.\n\nFlair and Valentine regained the tag titles from the Andersons on October 30, this time leaving Ole unable to leave under his own power. The team split after they were stripped of the titles in April 1978 by NWA president Eddie Graham as a result of their \"unprofessional conduct\". Flair then set his sights on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, while Valentine held the NWA World Tag Team Championships once more with Baron von Raschke in 1978.\n\nAt the same time, Valentine feuded with Chief Wahoo McDaniel over the NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. Wahoo had cost Valentine and Flair their first tag team championships (Wahoo, the then-nemesis of Flair, had been the special referee in the steel cage match), so Valentine was eager for revenge. On June 11, 1977 in Raleigh he defeated Wahoo, breaking his leg in the process. Though Wahoo's legs were too thick for Valentine to apply his signature Figure Four leglock, he managed to break Wahoo's ankle using a leg/ankle suplex. The heel Valentine then began wearing a T-shirt with the slogan \"\"I broke Wahoo's leg\" on the front and \"No more Wahoo\"\" on the back. Wahoo returned on August 9, 1977 and took back the title. Valentine would hold the title once more, defeating Wahoo again on September 10 and losing to Ken Patera on April 9, 1978.\n\nValentine began working on a casual basis for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), then owned by Vincent J. McMahon, in November 1978. Managed by The Grand Wizard, he was given the gimmick of a methodical wrestler who broke the legs of all his opponents, including Chief Jay Strongbow. In February 1979, he wrestled then WWWF Heavyweight Champion Bob Backlund to a one-hour time-limit draw at Madison Square Garden.\n\nValentine returned to the NWA in late 1979 and asked Flair to reform their tag team. Flair, by then a face, declined. Valentine held the NWA World Tag Team Championship once more with Ray Stevens in 1980. Four days after their victory, the promoter, David Crockett told Valentine and Stevens that he possessed film which proved that the illegal man had been pinned in the tag match, nullifying the win. When Crockett threatened to send the film to Bob Geigel (then the NWA President) who would overturn their victory, Stevens and Valentine attacked him and cut the film up with a pocketknife, destroying the evidence.\n\nValentine later claimed to have \"seen the light\", and reformed his team with Flair, who believed that Valentine was now a face. In a tag match against Jimmy Snuka and The Iron Sheik, Valentine abandoned Flair, leaving him outnumbered. Flair was beaten, and then Valentine snapped Gene Anderson’s hickory cane over his head, legitimately breaking his nose and splitting his lips. The former partners began feuding over Flair's NWA United States Heavyweight Championship, with Valentine finally defeating Flair for the title on July 26 in Flair's adopted hometown of Charlotte. He held the title until November 24, when he was beaten by Flair; Flair became one of Valentine's main opponents in the Mid-Atlantic territory.\n\nValentine would hold the United States Championship twice more, renewing his feud with Wahoo in 1982 and defeating him for the title on November 4 with the assistance of his manager, Sir Oliver Humperdink. Roddy Piper began pursuing the title, and, after Piper gave Valentine a cake with a dog collar inside, the two had a series of brutal dog collar matches, most notably at Starrcade 1983, where Piper pinned Valentine in a non-title match after repeatedly whipping him with the steel chain. The feud was intensified by Valentine's propensity to focus on Piper's ear, which had been injured earlier in his career and would bleed easily. Piper would eventually defeat Valentine on April 16, 1983, but Valentine regained the title on April 30 in Greensboro, NC; after the match, where he regained the US Title from Piper, Valentine hit Piper in the ear with US Title. He dropped the title to Dick Slater on December 14, just before leaving them for the World Wrestling Federation.\n\nValentine returned to the WWWF, now known as the World Wrestling Federation, for a year in 1981 and continued to pursue the title. On October 19, he was pinned by Backlund, but then handed the title belt by the dazed referee. The title was held up, and Backlund defeated Valentine cleanly in the November 23 rematch. In January 1982, Valentine met Backlund yet again, this time in a steel cage, for the WWF Heavyweight Championship at the Philadelphia Spectrum, which Backlund won.\n\nHe also feuded with Pedro Morales over the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, who he \"injured\" by suplexing him on the concrete floor of the arena. Valentine was not successful in winning this title either, and in mid-1982 left the promotion.\n\nValentine went back to the WWF in 1984, predicting that Vince McMahon's plan for national expansion would succeed. His first manager was Captain Lou Albano, and he was later managed by Jimmy Hart.\n\nOn September 24, 1984 in London, Ontario Valentine defeated Tito Santana for the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, focusing on Santana's injured knee throughout the match. Santana initially thought he had the match won, but had in fact only achieved a two-count. As Santana was celebrating, Valentine rolled him up for the pin and the title. Following the win, Valentine put Santana in the figure four leglock, reinjuring him. While Santana was sidelined having leg surgery, Valentine feuded with the Junkyard Dog, who he faced in an Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship Title match at the very first WrestleMania held in Madison Square Garden. Valentine pinned the JYD after using the ropes, but Santana came to ringside and informed the referee, who restarted the match. Valentine then walked out, losing the match by count-out but saving his title. Santana eventually healed and fought Valentine in many matches (after Santana returned to the ring by defeating The Executioner in the first ever match at Wrestlemania). He went on to win the title back on July 6, 1985 in a steel cage match in Baltimore, ending Valentine's 285-day reign, the fifth-longest in Intercontinental title history. Valentine, incensed over losing the championship belt, destroyed it in the steel cage, forcing the WWF to get a new Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt (in reality, this was pre-planned as the WWF already had a newer, more modern Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship belt made and destroying the old title belt was seen as the perfect way to introduce the new one).\n\nValentine would then form a tag team with Brutus Beefcake known as The Dream Team, managed by Luscious Johnny V. Initially the team was managed by both Jimmy Hart and Johnny V, but the WWF dropped Hart from the group and he went on to manage The Hart Foundation (Bret \"Hitman\" Hart and Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart). On August 24, 1985 at The Spectrum in Philadelphia, the Dream Team defeated The U.S. Express (Barry Windham and Mike Rotundo) for the WWF Tag Team Championship when Beefcake (kayfabe) rubbed Johnny V's lit cigar in Windham's eyes allowing him to be pinned. They held the titles until April 7, 1986 when they were defeated at WrestleMania 2 by The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and the Dynamite Kid). At WrestleMania III, The Dream Team defeated The Rougeau Brothers (Jacques and Raymond) as a result of interference by Johnny V and Dino Bravo. Upset because of a missed move by Beefcake during the match, Valentine left with Bravo and abandoned Beefcake, resulting in Brutus turning face later on in the night.\n\nReplacing Beefcake with Dino Bravo, Valentine formed The New Dream Team. Valentine was unhappy about teaming with Bravo, who he felt he had little chemistry with. After the WWF asked him to \"kidnap\" Matilda, the bulldog mascot of The British Bulldogs, Valentine resigned. He was brought back soon after, with Jimmy Hart again as his new manager (while the \"kidnap\" angle was reassigned to The Islanders) but was used in a much diminished role between 1987 and 1990.\n\nValentine was entered in the WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament at WrestleMania IV, where he defeated Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat in the first round before losing to \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, the eventual winner of the tournament, in the quarter-finals.\n\nIn 1988, Valentine feuded with \"The Rock\" Don Muraco, who had turned face a year earlier. The feud was triggered when Valentine viciously attacked Muraco's manager, former WWF Heavyweight Champion Superstar Billy Graham. Graham, walking with a cane, tried to intervene when Valentine held the figure-four leglock on jobber Ricky Ataki, after already winning the match. Valentine then put the figure-four leglock on Graham, who had a plastic hip. The feud was abruptly halted when Muraco was dismissed by the WWF, despite Valentine's pleas for Muraco not to be fired so that the promising program could be allowed to run. (Ironically, kayfabe magazine \"Inside Wrestling\" had run a story on the feud, claiming that it was Muraco, yearning to personally avenge Graham's injuries, who had begged the WWF not to dismiss Valentine).\n\nIn April 1989 he began feuding with \"Rugged\" Ronnie Garvin. Two weeks after WrestleMania V (where he teamed with the Jimmy Hart managed Honky Tonk Man in a loss to the now babyface Hart Foundation), he defeated Garvin in a retirement match on \"Superstars of Wrestling\" by reversing a small package and holding on to the ropes. Garvin became a referee until Valentine and Hart managed to have him fired. Garvin then became a ring announcer, and began aggravating Valentine. At SummerSlam 1989 for his match with Hercules, Garvin announced Valentine as being Hercules' \"so-called opponent\" and at 249 lbs looking to Garvin like he was \"overweight by thirty pounds\" and as he approached the ring. Other insults by Garvin during the introduction included Valentine not knowing whether he was \"coming or going\" and being the only wrestler Garvin knew who had \"two left feet\" and that he had a \"pipsqueak, poor excuse for a manager\". Following the match, Garvin then announced Hercules as the winner when Valentine cheated to win, despite the referee declaring Valentine the winner. Valentine knocked Garvin out of the ring before having a further punching match with Hercules while Garvin climbed back in the ring and nailed Valentine. The Hammer and Jimmy Hart eventually demanded that Garvin be reinstated so that they could fight in the ring.\n\nFor some time Valentine had been wearing a shin guard, which he would rotate (so it covered his calf, not his shin) in order to increase the pressure exerted by the Figure Four Leglock. He referred to the shin guard as the \"Heartbreaker\". Valentine would also (illegally) attach the shin guard to his arm in order to accentuate his elbow drops. In the course of the feud, Garvin countered with a rotated shin guard of his own, which he dubbed \"the Hammer Jammer\". The feud culminated in a submission match at the 1990 Royal Rumble. Garvin utilized the \"Hammer Jammer\" during the match, using it to \"counter\" Valentine's figure-four leglock when Valentine applied it on Garvin during the match (rather than writhing in pain as normal during the hold, Garvin was smiling and making faces at Valentine). Jimmy Hart managed to remove the \"Hammer Jammer\" from Garvin's leg, after which Valentine systematically wore down Garvin's leg, but eventually lost after Garvin hit him with the Heartbreaker and applied a sharpshooter, forcing Valentine to submit.\n\nShortly after, Valentine formed a tag team with The Honky Tonk Man. For around eight months Valentine resisted dying his hair black (an idea of Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura) but eventually relented and the team became known as Rhythm and Blues and were managed by Jimmy Hart. Rhythm and Blues feuded with The Bushwhackers (Butch and Luke) and The Hart Foundation, but were overshadowed by the Legion Of Doom (Animal and Hawk), who were by then dominating the tag division. Famously during the time of Rhythm and Blues, WWF announcer Gorilla Monsoon would proclaim every time Valentine got on the microphone and sang (while also attempting to play a guitar) that \"if you hung The Hammer for being a good singer you would hang an innocent person\".\n\nValentine became a face in December 1990 and on January 19, 1991, Valentine participated in the fourth annual Royal Rumble match. He lasted forty four minutes. He was to feud with his former partner, the Honky Tonk Man, but Honky left the WWF before the feud could begin. Valentine lost to the Jimmy Hart managed Earthquake at WrestleMania VII, and was defeated again at SummerSlam 1991 by Irwin R. Schyster. He participated in the 1992 Royal Rumble for the vacated WWF Championship, where he attacked his old rival Ric Flair before being eliminated by the Repo Man.\n\nConscious of his diminishing status, Valentine left the WWF and signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1992. He formed a tag team with Terry Taylor for six months and the duo went on to win the WCW United States Tag Team Championship. After Taylor was fired, Valentine was left without an angle, and eventually resigned in late 1992 when he was asked to lose to Sting.\n\nHe reappeared in the WWF at the 1993 Survivor Series under a mask as The Blue Knight in an elimination match pitting Shawn Michaels (who was substituting for Jerry Lawler) and his three \"knights\" (who also included Barry Horowitz as the Red Knight and Jeff Gaylord as the Black Knight) against the Hart Family. He would return again, as Greg Valentine, at the 1994 Royal Rumble, lasting over twenty minutes before being eliminated by Rick Martel. That summer Valentine would wrestle three times on a July house show tour, facing Bob Backlund on each occasion.\n\nOn July 1, 1996 Valentine returned to WCW and faced Randy Savage on \"WCW Monday Nitro\" in Landover, Maryland. Valentine was used primarily on television, facing The Giant, Harlem Heat, and Lex Luger. The following year he was used sparingly as well, again on television but had a 6-2 record, defeating Mike Enos, Bobby Eaton, and Billy Kidman. Valentine wrestled four times for the promotion in 1998 and was 3-1. He finished his WCW run with a victory over Pat Tanaka on February 17, 1998.\n\nValentine went on to tour the independent circuit, wrestling in Japan, with the Hamilton based International Championship Wrestling promotion and with the American Wrestling Federation. Starting in the summer of 1996, Valentine made several appearances with WCW over the course of the next two years. He was used on a pay-per-appearance basis, but was rarely utilized and was allowed to continue wrestling on the independent circuit. On October 10, 1999 he appeared on the infamous \"Heroes of Wrestling\" pay per view, pinning George \"The Animal\" Steele with the assistance of Sherri Martel. He wrestled on the 2000 tour of the United Kingdom in which Yokozuna died. He was also involved with the short-lived X Wrestling Federation as an investor and as an in-ring performer. In the 2000s, he began reducing his independent dates in order to pursue a career in real estate.\nOn January 29, 2005 at \"WrestleReunion\", Valentine won a seventeen-man battle royal to become the IWA Heavyweight Champion. He lost the title to Tito Santana at \"WrestleReunion #2\" on August 27 of that year. Valentine also wrestled for several independent promotions, including AWA Superstars of Wrestling, which toured New England. In AWA Superstars of Wrestling, Valentine regularly wrestled Tony Atlas.\n\nIn May 2007, Valentine defeated Quinson Valentino to win the Canadian Grand-Prix Wrestling Championship in Morrisburg, Ontario. On August 24, 2007, Valentine returned to Ontario to defend the CGPW Championship against Koko B. Ware in Cornwall, after Koko defeated Valentine in a non-title match, on the previous night, in Ottawa. Valentine was successful in defeating Koko in Cornwall, though the title was vacated due to inactivity.\n\nIn late 2007, Valentine made an appearance in JCW or Juggalo Championship Wrestling reforming the Dream Team with Brutus Beefcake. in an 8 team elimination match for the then vacant JCW Tag-Team Titles. Where they were the first team to be eliminated after a slightly botched sunset flip from Necro Butcher.\n\nOn January 29, 2011, Valentine was inducted into the Legends Pro Wrestling \"Hall of Fame\" by Jack Blaze in Wheeling, West Virginia, at their annual \"LPW Over The Edge\" event.\n\nOn March 13, 2004, Valentine was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004 by his former manager Jimmy Hart. The following night, at WrestleMania XX at Madison Square Garden, Valentine received loud applause when the class of 2004 was introduced. Shortly after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, Valentine dedicated the plaque he received to his late father by saying: \"This one's for you pop, Johnny Valentine\". On October 3, 2005, Valentine made an appearance at WWE Homecoming, and on October 23 he was defeated by Rob Conway (then using a gimmick similar to that of Randy Orton's gimmick of \"the legend killer\") on an episode of WWE Heat after Eugene interfered on his behalf, causing the referee to award a victory via disqualification to Conway. He was present at the Retirement Ceremony of his long-time friend, Ric Flair, on the March 31, 2008 episode of \"WWE Raw\".\n\nGreg married Julie on February 14, 1995. He had two daughters, Vanessa and Romaine, with his first wife, who once appeared on WWF TV in 1984 to give Valentine a back rub, which he claimed was the secret of his success. Vanessa began training with the Hart Brothers in the late 1990s. Vanessa died of cancer in 2015. He is a born again Christian and occasionally speaks at high schools and colleges with Ted DiBiase. He is also a part of Christian wrestling organization, World Impact Wrestling. He is the brother-in-law of wrestler Brian Knobbs.\n\nValentine has appeared on an episode of \"Hogan Knows Best\" as one of Hulk's party guests. He also co-starred in Fuse's \"Insane Clown Posse Theater\" along with Insane Clown Posse members Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope. The cast was rounded out with Michelle \"Sugar Slam\" Rapp, Kevin Gill, and Vampiro. Valentine played an usher who ejected guests from the theater when their time is up on the show.\n\nHe appeared as a playable character on Legends of Wrestling. Legends of Wrestling II, and WWE Legends of WrestleMania. He was also downloadable content in WWE 2K17 and also appears in WWE 2K18 along with Brutus Beefcake as The Dream Team.\n\nIn 2008 Valentine co-starred with George \"The Animal\" Steele in a short film entitled \"Somethin Fishy\", in which the two former wrestlers purchase a fishing camp. The film served as the pilot for a comedy series that was not developed further.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21564683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21564683", "title": "Irish Queer Archive", "text": "Irish Queer Archive\n\nIrish Queer Archive (IQA) () is a comprehensive collection of material in Ireland relating to homosexuality, LGBT literature and general queer studies.\n\nThe Archive contains the most comprehensive collection of material in Ireland relating to homosexuality in particular and lesbian/gay, bisexual and transgender studies in general. There are some quarter million press cuttings from the late 1960s onwards, a library of several hundred international titles (the earliest, a US title, dates from 1951), a complete set of every lesbian/gay title (periodicals and single issues) published since 1974 on the island of Ireland, and a collection of audiovisual material, photographs and slides, flyers, posters, badges and other ephemera. Amongst the private papers and organisational records are the archives of Alternative Miss Ireland, the Dublin Lesbian & Gay Film Festival [GAZE], National LGBT Federation, IGRM, Gay Health Action, GLEN, Lesbians Organising Together (LOT), Dublin LGBT Pride, and Gay Community News (GCN].\n\nThe Irish Queer Archive – a vast collection of material which provides insights into the social, cultural and political history of the LGBT communities in an Irish and international context during the latter half of the 20th century – was presented in 2008 to the National Library of Ireland following a decision to donate it by the National LGBT Federation. IQA is a living archive and continues to accept donations and deposits.\n\nPost Stonewall ‘69, Irish lesbian and gay groups and individual activists have laboured to document their history; a history that ultimately touches on all of Irish life in the 20th century. Well-preserved yet incomplete records bear witness to the nascent lesbian and gay civil rights era of the early 1970s. Organisations like the Northern Irish Gay Rights Association (NIGRA), Irish Gay Rights Movement (IGRM) and the National LGBT Federation (NXF) maintained a tradition of preservation with keen foresight, often at considerable expense and with limited human resources.\n\nAs one of the largest, oldest and continuous lesbian/gay corporate organisations in Ireland, NXF has been to the forefront of maintaining some semblance of an archive. From the late ‘70s onwards this was confined to a rudimentary press clippings service and some limited research by, amongst others, activists Edmund Lynch, David Norris and Tom McClean. Like many organisations, NXF also managed to acquire or subsume the interests and records of other smaller, often more specialised, groups. One example of this is the entire archive of Out, Ireland's first commercial monthly gay magazine (1984-1988). The Out holding typically includes proofed manuscripts, original artwork, administrative and financial files, photographs, illustrations and file copies.\n\nFrom 1980 onwards a larger group of people in NXF helped maintain and preserve documents and cuttings. NXF capitalised on years of acquisition by holding onto a huge number of international titles that were surplus to ILGA’s requirements when the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) moved its information secretariat from Dublin to Stockholm in 1982. This collection constitutes the bedrock of the archive's library of international titles dating back to 1951.\n\nThe archive and reference library was put on a more organised footing in Midsummer 1997 when NXF and GCN moved into new premises on South William Street, Dublin. At that point, civil rights activist Tonie Walsh, along with librarians Linda Forry and Plunkett Conroy, began a systematic re-organisation of its holdings. A limited public office was set up in a short time, facilitating researchers, students and historians, in addition to servicing the research needs of journalists at Gay Community News.\n\nAlthough it struggled financially in the following years with finding suitable, affordable office and storage accommodation, NXF lost no time in appointing a group of academics, historians and writers to focus on exploiting the collections and making suggestions for a future safe home. This IQA group consisted of Dr. Eibhear Walshe, lecturer in English at UCC; Dr. Mary McAuliffe and Dr. Katherine O’Donnell, both of Gender Studies at UCD; Joan Murphy, an RTÉ archivist; librarian Elizabeth Kirwan of NLI; and Tonie Walsh, coincidentally a former president of NXF and founding editor of Gay Community News (GCN).\n\nExtensive overtures and negotiations with Gerry Lyne (since retired) of the Department of Manuscripts at the National Library of Ireland ultimately bore fruit when it was agreed in 2008 to transfer the collections to NLI. The historic transfer of IQA to NLI was also hugely symbolic as it signalled the Irish state taking ownership of LGBT heritage. However, given the size of the archive, much work needs to be done in filing, cataloguing and ultimately digitising the entire collection.IQA holdings that have been made accessible are described as Manuscripts Collection List No. 151. Further information may be gleaned from the National Library website: www.nli.ie.\n\nAn advisory group, composed of many of the above-mentioned individuals, continues to focus on opportunities to help the National Library of Ireland exploit its collection. Regular cultural updates are featured on its Facebook page: www.facebook.com/IQAadvisorygroup.\n\n"}

They are accompanied by a full, alphabetized list of citations in an end section, usually titled \"references\", \"reference list\", \"works cited\", or \"end-text citations\". Parenthetical referencing can be used in lieu of footnote citations (the Vancouver system).\n\nThere are two styles of parenthetical referencing:\n\nAccording to an 1896 paper, the origin of the author–date style is attributed to a paper by Edward Laurens Mark, Hersey professor of anatomy and director of the zoological laboratory at Harvard University, who may have copied it from the cataloguing system used then and now by the library of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. In 1881 Mark wrote a paper on the embryogenesis of the garden slug, in which he included an author–date citation in parentheses on page 194, the first known instance of such a reference. Until then, according to Eli Chernin writing in the \"British Medical Journal\", references had appeared in inconsistent styles in footnotes, referred to in the text using a variety of printers' symbols, including asterisks and daggers. Chernin writes that a 1903 festschrift dedicated to Mark by 140 students, including Theodore Roosevelt, confirms that the author–date system is attributable to Mark. The festschrift pays tribute to Mark's 1881 paper, writing that it \"introduced into zoology a proper fullness and accuracy of citation and a convenient and uniform method of referring from text to bibliography.\" According to an editorial note in the \"British Medical Journal\" in 1945, an unconfirmed anecdote is that the term \"Owen system\" was introduced by an English visitor to Harvard University library, who was impressed by the citation system and dubbed it \"Harvard system\" upon his return to England.\n\nAlthough it originated in biology, it is now more common in humanities, history, and social science. It is favored by a few scientific journals, including the major biology journal \"Cell.\"\n\nIn the author–date method (Harvard referencing), the in-text citation is placed in parentheses after the sentence or part thereof that the citation supports. The citation includes the author's name, year of publication, and page number(s) when a specific part of the source is referred to (Smith 2008, p. 1) or (Smith 2008:1). A full citation is given in the references section: Smith, John (2008). \"Name of Book\". Name of Publisher.\n\nThe structure of a citation under the author–date method is the author's surname, year of publication, and page number or range, in parentheses, as illustrated in the Smith example near the top of this article.\n\nAn example of a journal reference:\n\nFollowing is an explanation of the components, where the coloring is for demonstration purposes and is not used in actual formatting:\n<br>\nHeilman, J. M. and West, A.

If the city is not internationally well known, the country (or state and country if in the U.S.) is given.\n\nAn example of a newspaper reference:\n\n\n\nIn the author–title or author–page method, also referred to as MLA style, the in-text citation is placed in parentheses after the sentence or part thereof that the citation supports, and includes the author's name (a short title only is necessary when there is more than one work by the same author) and a page number where appropriate (Smith 1) or (Smith, \"Playing\" 1). (No \"p.\" or \"pp.\" prefaces the page numbers and main words in titles appear in capital letters, following MLA style guidelines.) A full citation is given in the references section.\n\nA content note generally contains useful information and explanations that do not fit into the primary text itself. Content notes may be given as footnotes or endnotes or even a combination of both footnotes and endnotes. Such content notes may themselves contain a style of parenthetical referencing, just as the main text does.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56439446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56439446", "title": "Style (book)", "text": "Style (book)\n\nF. L. Lucas's Style (1955) is a book about the writing and appreciation of \"good prose\", expanded for the general reader from lectures originally given to English Literature students at Cambridge University. It sets out to answer the questions, \"Why is so much writing wordy, confused, graceless, dull?\" and \"What are the qualities that endow language, spoken or written, with persuasiveness or power?\" It offers \"a few principles\" and \"a number of examples of the effective use of language, especially in prose\", and adds \"a few warnings\". The book is written as a series of eleven essays (with much quotation and anecdote, and without bullet-points or note-form), which themselves illustrate the virtues commended. The work is unified by what Lucas calls \"one vital thread, on which the random principles of good writing may be strung, and grasped as a whole\". That \"vital thread\" is \"courtesy to readers\". It is upon this emphasis on good manners, urbanity, good humour, grace, control, that the book's aspiration to usefulness rests. Discussion tends to circle back to 18th-century masters like Voltaire, Montesquieu, Gibbon, the later Johnson, or their successors like Sainte-Beuve, Anatole France, Lytton Strachey and Desmond MacCarthy. \n\nThe book begins with a definition of style in prose, and a discussion of its importance. It questions the extent to which style can be taught, given that it is a reflection of personality (\"The problems of style are really problems of personality\" ), but concludes that \"Writers should write from the best side of their characters, and at their best moments.\" It goes on to outline the elements of a lucid, varied and pointed prose style; to warn of perils to be avoided (the book is an anthology of weeds as well as flowers); and to explore different methods of planning, composition and revision. There is a chapter on the rhythms of prose and on aural effects. Passages quoted for analysis are in a range of styles, taken from letters, essays, criticism, biography, history, novels and plays. Aside from simile and metaphor, the book does not deal, except incidentally, with figures of speech; nor with rhetorical tropes, apart from irony and syntactical devices such as inversion and antithesis. Lucas does not deal, except in passing, with points of correct English usage, referring readers to Fowler's \"Modern English Usage\" for these. Giving a few examples of regrettable change and ignorance, however, he stresses the importance of \"preserving the purity of the English tongue\". Languages evolve, but can also degenerate. \n\nThe book was based on one of Lucas's first courses of lectures at Cambridge (1946 to 1953) after his return from Bletchley Park. The decision to lecture on 'Good prose, and the writing of it' (the course was later renamed 'Style') reflected a wish to improve the quality of student essays, adversely affected, Lucas felt, by the New Criticism. The decision to expand the lectures into book form for the general reader was prompted partly by his recent experience as an Intelligence report-writer in Hut 3, and partly by his belief that \"on the quality of a nation's language depends to some extent the quality of its life and thought; and on the quality of its life and thought the quality of its language\". First published in 1955 by Cassell & Company of London and by the Macmillan Company, New York, \"Style\" went through seven impressions in the UK between 1955 and 1964. In the second edition, published by Collier Books of New York in 1962 and by Pan Books of London in 1964, Lucas made minor changes and added – in response to some readers' protests – footnote translations (his own) of the book's foreign-language quotations. Cassell reprinted the first edition in 1974, adding a Foreword by Sir Bruce Fraser; this reissue Cassell mistakenly called the \"second edition\". After being out-of-print for four decades, the real second edition, with Lucas's translations, checked against the first edition, was reprinted in 2012 by Harriman House Publishing, of Petersfield, who added their own sub-title, 'The Art of Writing Well'. \"Though one cannot teach people to write well,\" Lucas had observed, \"one can sometimes teach them to write rather better.\" \n\n\"Style\" was generally well received. \"A delightful book,\" wrote \"Time and Tide\", \"exemplifying brilliantly all that it seeks to instill – enjoyment of reading and mastery of writing.\" It was Lucas's most successful book. He had long had a reputation as a stylist, \"one whose pen possesses the sparkle and fascination which made the essay, in the hands of writers such as Bacon and Montaigne, a thing of beauty and interest\". Raymond Mortimer in \"The Sunday Times\", however, found the author \"sometimes laboured in his anxiety to be debonair\". Some reviewers expressed the view that \"The book's most obvious merit lies in its quotations\" (Rayner Heppenstall in the \"New Statesman\"). \"There are almost as many in French as in English, and their range and aptness are remarkable.\" Others, however, felt that there should have been fewer examples from poetry and more from contemporary prose. \"The Listener\" approved \"the entertaining relevance of anecdote\". Sir Bruce Fraser praised Lucas's close analysis of faulty style: \"The passage in which he dissects a great hunk of Swinburne's prose, reduces it by more than half, recognizes that it could be made shorter still, and ends by suggesting that it need not have been written at all, is in itself worth the whole price of the book\". Philip Toynbee of \"The Observer\" disliked the work and dismissed its author as \"middlebrow\": \"There have been wonderful styles which illustrate the virtues of clarity, brevity, simplicity and vitality. Other styles, no less wonderful, have exhibited obscurity, amplitude, complexity and decadence. Good writers have been urbane, gay and healthy: other good writers have been boorish, melancholic and diseased... Mr Lucas pays lip-service to the recalcitrant disorder of the scene\" but \"writes far too briefly of variety\". More recently, Joseph Epstein in \"The New Criterion\" (2011) considered the book \"filled with fine things ... F. L. Lucas wrote the best book on prose composition, for the not-so-simple reason that, in the modern era, he was the smartest, most cultivated man to turn his energies to the task\". The 2011 article \"brought attention to this neglected classic and helped set in train its reissue\".\n\nLucas returned to the subject in a 4000-word essay, 'On the Fascination of Style', published in the March 1960 number of \"Holiday\" magazine. The essay reworks the core points of \"Style\" more succinctly, in a different order and with some changes in emphasis, and adds new examples and a few autobiographical anecdotes. It was reprinted in Birk & Birk, \"The Odyssey Reader: Ideas and Style\" (New York, 1968) and in McCuen & Winkler, \"Readings for Writers\" (New York, 2009). The essay was reissued in 2012 as 'How to Write Powerful Prose', by Harriman House Publishing, Petersfield.\n"}
{"id": "169303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169303", "title": "The Far Side", "text": "The Far Side\n\nThe Far Side is a single-panel comic created by Gary Larson and syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate, which ran from January 1, 1980, to January 1, 1995 (when Larson retired as a cartoonist). Its surrealistic humor is often based on uncomfortable social situations, improbable events, an anthropomorphic view of the world, logical fallacies, impending bizarre disasters, (often twisted) references to proverbs, or the search for meaning in life. Larson's frequent use of animals and nature in the comic is popularly attributed to his background in biology. Reruns are still printed in many newspapers.\n\n\"The Far Side\" was ultimately carried by more than 1,900 daily newspapers, translated into 17 languages, and collected into calendars, greeting cards, and 23 compilation books. \n\nLarson was recognized for his work on the strip with the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1985 and 1988, and with their Reuben Award for 1990 and 1994.\n\nThe series was preceded by a similar panel called \"Nature's Way\", also by Larson. Larson decided that he could increase his income from cartooning by selling his \"Nature's Way\" strip to another newspaper. While on vacation in San Francisco, he pitched his work to the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and, to his surprise, the \"Chronicle\" bought the strip and promoted it for syndication, renaming it \"The Far Side\". Its first appearance in the \"Chronicle\" was on January 1, 1980. A week later, \"The Seattle Times\" dropped \"Nature’s Way.\" \"The Far Side\" ran for fifteen years, syndicated initially by Chronicle Features and later by Universal Press Syndicate, until Larson retired with his final strip published on January 1, 1995.\n\nOne of \"The Far Side\" cartoons shows two chimpanzees grooming. One finds a blonde human hair on the other and inquires, \"Conducting a little more 'research' with that Jane Goodall tramp?\" Goodall herself was in Africa at the time, and the Jane Goodall Institute thought this was in bad taste, and had their lawyers draft a letter to Larson and his distribution syndicate, in which they described the cartoon as an \"atrocity.\" They were stymied by Goodall herself when she returned and saw the cartoon, as she stated that she found the cartoon amusing. Since then, all profits from sales of a shirt featuring this cartoon go to the Jane Goodall Institute. Goodall wrote a preface to \"The Far Side Gallery 5\", detailing her version of the controversy, and the Institute's letter was included next to the cartoon in the complete \"Far Side\" collection. She praised Larson's creative ideas, which often compare and contrast the behavior of humans and animals.\n\n\"\" and \"The Prehistory of The Far Side\" include letters from angry readers alongside the comics. The letters were written to newspaper publishers and often demanded the removal of \"The Far Side\". Despite these protests, \"The Far Side\" remained popular and continued to run in many newspapers. Larson himself often laughs at the controversies as evidenced in \"The Prehistory of The Far Side\", in which he writes that the people complaining have usually misunderstood the cartoon.\n\nIn 2003, Gary Larson drew a cover for the November 17 edition of \"The New Yorker\" magazine (the Cartoon Issue), a prestigious offer he said he could not refuse.\n\nMost \"The Far Side\" cartoons are a single rectangular panel, occasionally split into small sections of four, six, or eight for the purposes of a storyline. A caption or dialogue usually appears under the panel as typed text, although word-balloons are sometimes used for conversations. Sunday comics were double-sized, done in watercolor or colored pencils, with captions handwritten in Larson's own hand. Most of Larson's comics relied on some combination of a visual and verbal gag, rather than just one or the other. Some recurring themes in the comic include people being stranded on desert islands, aliens, heaven, hell, and the life of cavepeople. Many cartoons focused on animals, especially cows, bears, dogs, flies, and ducks. Notably, virtually all characters portrayed in the comic were overweight or obese, and usually wearing glasses. In addition, unless needed for a facial or comic expression, eyes are almost never drawn and characters usually show only a brow ridge.\n\nGary Larson produced 23 \"The Far Side\" books, which were all on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. The cartoons were first collected in small books (see list below), and some were then republished in larger best-of collections such as \"The Far Side Galleries\". Additional best-of collections were published, such as \"The Prehistory of The Far Side\", culminating in the final publication, \"The Complete Far Side\" in 2003.\n\n\n\nThe five \"The Far Side Gallery\" books are the most popular, each of them collecting together the best cartoons from three smaller books, along with a humorous foreword by celebrity fans, including Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen King, Robin Williams, and Jane Goodall.\n\nIn 1989, \"The Prehistory of The Far Side\" was published to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the strip. In this book, Gary Larson discussed the development of \"The Far Side\", and the public's reaction to it, and presented a selection of his personal favorites from the cartoon's history as well as previously unpublished sketches and strips rejected by his editor.\n\nIn 2003, \"The Complete Far Side\" was released, containing nearly every \"The Far Side\" comic ever published (except for a few cartoons written for Christmas cards). The collection is also missing parody art pieces from \"Wiener Dog Art\", some material from \"The Prehistory of The Far Side\", and a panel run for a caption writing contest in the \"Telegram-Tribune\" newspaper. The set was released in two volumes (1980–1986 and 1987–1994) with a foreword by Steve Martin and an introduction by Larson's longtime editor, Jake Morrisey. The first-edition hardcover boxed set weighs . Some of the comics were altered for this book, either featuring a different caption, correcting errors, or simply becoming colorized.\n\nIn 1994, Larson produced an animated special, \"Tales from the Far Side\", featuring his art style and gags from the strips. He produced a sequel in 1997.\n\nLarson has asked people not to use \"Far Side\" cartoons on the internet, writing a widely distributed letter in which he explains the \"emotional cost\" to him of people displaying his cartoons on their websites and asks them to stop doing so.\n\nIn 1987, a special exhibit of 527 black and white \"Far Side\" panels was shown in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C. 127 of the panels were originals, displayed in the rotunda on boards that held 50 panels each. Later the display became a traveling exhibit that was shown in San Francisco, Washington D.C., Orlando, Chicago, Toronto, New York City, Denver, and Los Angeles.\n\nThere was a \"Far Side\" gallery at the California Academy of Science that featured some of Larson's panels. The exhibit included a giant microscope under which visitors could stand, based on one of Larson's cartoons. Looking up through the objective lens revealed a giant blinking eyeball. The building was torn down and replaced and the exhibit is no longer in the new facility.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1253235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1253235", "title": "Third Position", "text": "Third Position\n\nThird Position is an ideology that was developed in the late 20th century by political parties including Terza Posizione in Italy and Troisième Voie in France. It emphasizes opposition to both communism and capitalism. Advocates of Third Position politics typically present themselves as \"beyond left and right\" while syncretizing ideas from each end of the political spectrum, usually reactionary right-wing cultural views and radical left-wing economic views.\n\nThe term \"Third Position\" was coined in Europe and the main precursors of Third Position politics were National Bolshevism (a synthesis of far-right ultranationalism and far-left Bolshevik socialism) and Strasserism (a radical, mass-action, worker-based, socialist form of National Socialism, advocated by the \"left-wing\" of the Nazi Party until it was crushed in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 ). Neo-fascist, Neo-Nazi author Francis Parker Yockey had proposed an alliance between communists and fascists called \"Red-Brown Alliance\" (Red being the color of communism and Brown being the color of Nazism) which would have been anti-Semitic, anti-American, and anti-Zionist in nature. Yockey lent support to Third World liberation movements as well.\n\nAt the peak of the Cold War, the former Argentine President Juan Perón (1946–1955; 1973–1974) defined the international position of his doctrine (Peronism) as a Third Position between capitalism and communism, a stance which became a precedent of the Non-Aligned Movement. \n\nInternational Third Position (ITP) was a neo-fascist organisation formed by the breakaway faction of the British National Front, led by Roberto Fiore, an ex-member of the Italian far-right movement Third Position.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, a number of splinter groups from the radical left became associated with radical nationalism. Jacques Doriot's French Popular Party (from the French Communist Party) and Marcel Déat's National Popular Rally (from the French Section of the Workers' International). Third Position ideology gained some support in France, where in 1985 Jean-Gilles Malliarakis set up a \"Third Way\" political party, Troisième Voie (TV). Considering its main enemies to be the United States, communism and Zionism, the group advocated radical paths to national revolution. Associated for a time with the Groupe Union Défense, TV was generally on poor terms with Front National until 1991, when Malliarakis decided to approach them. As a result, TV fell apart and a radical splinter group under Christian Bouchet, Nouvelle Résistance, adopted National Bolshevik and then Eurasianist views.\n\nIn Italy, the Third Position was developed by Roberto Fiore, along with Gabriele Adinolfi and Peppe Dimitri, in the tradition of Italian neo-fascism. Third Position’s ideology is characterized by a militarist formulation, a palingenetic ultranationalism looking favourably to national liberation movements, support for racial separatism and the adherence to a soldier lifestyle. In order to construct a cultural background for the ideology, Fiore looked to the ruralism of Julius Evola and sought to combine it with the desire for a cultural-spiritual revolution. He adopted some of the positions of the contemporary far-right, notably the ethnopluralism of Alain de Benoist and the Europe-wide appeal associated with such views as the Europe a Nation campaign of Oswald Mosley (amongst others). Fiore was one of the founders of the Terza Posizione movement in 1978. Third Position ideas are now represented in Italy by Forza Nuova, led by Fiore; and by the movement CasaPound, a network of far-right social centres.\n\nIn the United States, the Political Research Associates argue that Third Position politics has been promoted by some white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups such as the National Alliance, American Front, Traditionalist Worker Party and White Aryan Resistance as well as some black nationalist groups such as the Nation of Islam, since the late 20th century. In 2010, the American Third Position Party (later renamed American Freedom Party) was founded in part to channel the right-wing populist resentment engendered by the financial crisis of 2007–2010 and the policies of the Obama administration.\n\n\n"}

These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as \"etc.\" and \"Mrs.\" are not three-letter acronyms, but \"TLA\" is a TLA (an example of an autological abbreviation).\n\nMost three-letter abbreviations are \"initialisms\": all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in \"APA\" . Some are acronyms pronounced as a word; computed axial tomography, CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name in \"CAT scan\".\n\n\nThe exact phrase \"three-letter acronym\" appeared in the sociology literature in 1975. Three-letter acronyms were used as mnemonics in biological sciences, from 1977 and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982. They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing. In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair ZX81 home computer used and explained TLA. The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a JPL report of 1982. In 1988, in a paper titled \"On the cruelty of really teaching computer science\", eminent computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra wrote \n\"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA ...\" By 1992 it was in a Microsoft handbook.\n\nThe number of possible three-letter abbreviations (or permutations) using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576. Another 26 × 26 × 10 = 6760 can be produced if the third element is allowed to be a digit 0-9, giving a total of 24,336.\n\nIn English, WWW is the longest possible TLA to pronounce, typically requiring nine syllables. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from how it is quicker to say the acronym instead of than the phrase they represent, however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables than the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, \"www\" is sometimes abbreviated as \"dubdubdub\" in speech.\n\n\n"}

News producers may air VNRs, in whole or in part, at their discretion or incorporate them into news reports if they contain information appropriate to a story or of interest to viewers.\n\nCritics of VNRs have called the practice deceptive or a propaganda technique, particularly when the segment is not identified to the viewers as a VNR. Firms producing VNRs disagree and equate their use to a press release in video form and point to the fact that editorial judgement in the worthiness, part or whole, of a VNR's content is still left in the hands of journalists, program producers or the like. The United States Federal Communications Commission is currently investigating the practice of VNRs.\n\nMost VNRs feature a professional news reporter, someone with on-air news experience, or an actor. VNRs also often include interviews with experts (who often have legitimate, if biased, expertise); so called \"man on the street\" interviews with \"average\" people; and pictures of celebrities, products, service demonstrations, corporate logos and the like, where applicable. In some cases the \"man on the street\" segments feature persons randomly selected and interviewed spontaneously, and in other cases actors are hired and directed by VNR producers to deliver carefully scripted comments. In addition, regardless of whether real people or professional actors appear, VNR producers and directors, just like journalists, have complete discretion to excerpt and edit these \"interviews\" into 'sound bites' that help make the point they are trying to make.\n\nCommercial television stations and other media outlets often broadcast only portions of a VNR. Sometimes they use the script provided by the VNR producer but frequently they write their own script.\n\nIn a report released on April 6, 2006, the Center for Media and Democracy listed detailed information on 77 television stations that it said had broadcast VNRs in the prior 10 months, and which VNRs had been broadcast. Most of these VNR uses were of partial feeds. However, CMD said that in each case the television station actively disguised the VNR content to make it appear to be its own reporting, and that more than one-third of the time, stations aired the pre-packaged VNR in its entirety.\n\nVNRs have been used extensively in business since at least the early 1980s. Corporations such as Microsoft and Philip Morris, and the pharmaceutical industry generally, have all made use of the technique.\n\nAccording to the trade-group Public Relations Society of America, a VNR is the video equivalent of a press release. and presents a client's case in an attractive, informative format. The VNR placement agency seeks to garner media attention for the client's products, services, brands or other marketing goals. The VNR affords local TV stations free broadcast quality materials for use in reports offered by such stations.\n\nPublic Relations agencies have their video tapes encoded allowing very accurate tracking of where such video is used. (see: SIGMA (verification service) for additional information).\n\nOne critic of the VNR technique, John Stauber, an observer and critic of the Public Relations business says, \"These fellows are whistling past the graveyard, assuring themselves that this all is no big deal. There was no hint of shame, certainly no apologizing, just apparent disdain for having their business practices dissected on the front page of the New York Times. They are proud of their work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The area is called \"El Bailadero\", which refers to the dances performed by witches around a bonfire. It was believed that after the covens, witches came down to the coast to swim naked. With the passage of time, due to the influence of vampire stories in Eastern Europe, this led to the myth that witches incorporated the aspect of drinking blood, thus making them witch-vampire, typically tales were created that these witches sucked the blood of newborns as they slept in their cribs. \n\nThere is also a theory that the origin of this legend, was from pagan rituals associated with rituals that celebrated guanches rain, these rituals were considered as an act of witchcraft by the Catholic Church.\n"}
