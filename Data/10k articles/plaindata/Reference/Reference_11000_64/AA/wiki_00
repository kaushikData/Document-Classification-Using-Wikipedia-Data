{"id": "1245010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1245010", "title": "Ars Amatoria", "text": "Ars Amatoria\n\nThe Ars amatoria () is an instructional elegy series in three books by the ancient Roman poet Ovid. It was written in 2 AD.\n\nBook one of \"Ars amatoria\" was written to show a man how to find a woman. In book two, Ovid shows how to keep her. The third book, written two years after the first books were published, gives women advice on how to win and keep the love of a man (\"I have just armed the Greeks against the Amazons; now, Penthesilea, it remains for me to arm thee against the Greeks...\").\n\nThe first two books, aimed at men, contain sections which cover such topics as 'not forgetting her birthday', 'letting her miss you - but not for long' and 'not asking about her age'. The third gives similar advice to women, sample themes include: 'making up, but in private', 'being wary of false lovers' and 'trying young and older lovers'. Although the book was finished around 2 AD, much of the advice he gives is applicable to any day and age. His intent is often more profound than the brilliance of the surface suggests. In connection with the revelation that the theatre is a good place to meet girls, for instance, Ovid, the classically educated trickster, refers to the story of the rape of the Sabine women. It has been argued that this passage represents a radical attempt to redefine relationships between men and women in Roman society, advocating a move away from paradigms of force and possession, towards concepts of mutual fulfilment.\n\nThe superficial brilliance, however, befuddles even scholars (paradoxically, Ovid consequently tended in the 20th century to be underrated as lacking in seriousness). The standard situations and cliches of the subject are treated in an entertainment-intended way, with details from Greek mythology, everyday Roman life and general human experience. Ovid likens love to military service, supposedly requiring the strictest obedience to the woman. He advises women to make their lovers artificially jealous so that they do not become neglectful through complacency. Perhaps accordingly, a slave should be instructed to interrupt the lovers' tryst with the cry 'Perimus' ('We are lost!'), compelling the young lover to hide in fear in a cupboard. The tension implicit in this uncommitted tone is reminiscent of a flirt, and in fact, the semi-serious, semi-ironic form is ideally suited to Ovid's subject matter.\n\nIt is striking that through all his ironic discourse, Ovid never becomes ribald or obscene. Of course 'embarrassing' matters can never be entirely excluded, for 'praecipue nostrum est, quod pudet, inquit, opus' 'what brings a blush ... is our especial business here'. Sexual matters in the narrower sense are only dealt with at the end of each book, so here again, form and content converge in a subtly ingenious way. Things, so to speak, always end up in bed. But here, too, Ovid retains his style and his discretion, avoiding any pornographic tinge. The end of the second book deals with the pleasures of simultaneous orgasm. Somewhat atypically for a Roman, the poet confesses, \"Odi concubitus, qui non utrumque resolvunt. Hoc est, cur pueri tangar amore minus\" ('I don't like intercourse that doesn't make both lovers come. That's why I'm less into the love of boys.').\n\nAt the end of the third part, as in the Kama Sutra, the sexual positions are 'declined', and from them women are exhorted to choose the most suitable, taking the proportions of their own bodies into careful consideration. Ovid's tongue is again discovered in his cheek when his recommendation that tall women should not straddle their lovers is exemplified at the expense of the tallest hero of the Trojan Wars: \"Quod erat longissima, numquam Thebais Hectoreo nupta resedit equo\" ('Since she was very tall, the daughter of Thebes (Andromache) as wife never mounted Hector as horse').\n\nHowever, the word \"ars\" in the title is not to be translated coldly as 'technique', or as 'art' in the sense of civilized refinement, but as \"textbook\", the literal and antique definition of the word.\n\nAppropriately for its subject, the \"Ars amatoria\" is composed in elegiac couplets, rather than the dactylic hexameters, which are more usually associated with the didactic poem.\n\nThe work was such a popular success that the poet wrote a sequel, \"Remedia Amoris\" (Remedies for Love). At an early \"recitatio\", however, S. Vivianus Rhesus is noted as having walked out in disgust.\n\nThe assumption that the 'licentiousness' of the \"Ars amatoria\" was responsible in part for Ovid's relegation (banishment) by Augustus in AD 8 is dubious, and seems rather to reflect modern sensibilities than historical fact. For one thing, the work had been in circulation for eight years by the time of the relegation, and it postdates the Julian Marriage Laws by eighteen years. Secondly, it is hardly likely that Augustus, after forty years unchallenged in the purple, felt the poetry of Ovid to be a serious threat or even embarrassment to his social policies. Thirdly, Ovid's own statement from his Black Sea exile that his relegation was because of 'carmen et error' ('a song and a mistake') is, for many reasons, hardly admissible.\n\nIt is more probable that Ovid was somehow caught up in factional politics connected with the succession: Postumus Agrippa, Augustus' adopted son, and Augustus' granddaughter, Vipsania Julilla, were both relegated at around the same time. This would also explain why Ovid was not reprieved when Augustus was succeeded by Agrippa's rival Tiberius. It is likely, then, that the \"Ars amatoria\" was used as an excuse for the relegation. This would be neither the first nor the last time a 'crackdown on immorality' disguised an uncomfortable political secret.\n\nThe \"Ars amatoria\" created considerable interest at the time of its publication. On a lesser scale, Martial's epigrams take a similar context of advising readers on love. Modern literature has been continually influenced by the \"Ars amatoria\", which has presented additional information on the relationship between Ovid's poem and more current writings. The \"Ars amatoria\" was included in the syllabuses of mediaeval schools from the second half of the 11th century, and its influence on 12th and 13th centuries' European literature was so great that the German mediaevalist and palaeographer Ludwig Traube dubbed the entire age 'aetas Ovidiana' ('the Ovidian epoch').\n\nAs in the years immediately following its publication, the \"Ars amatoria\" has historically been victim of moral outcry. All of Ovid's works were burned by Savonarola in Florence, Italy in 1497; an English translation of the \"Ars amatoria\" was seized by U.S. Customs in 1930. Despite the actions against the work, it continues to be studied in college courses on Latin literature.\n\nIt is possible that Edmond Rostand's fictionalized portrayal of Cyrano de Bergerac makes an allusion to the \"Ars amatoria\": the theme of the erotic and seductive power of poetry is highly suggestive of Ovid's poem, and Bergerac's nose, a distinguishing feature invented by Rostand, calls to mind Ovid's cognomen, Naso (from \"nasus\", 'large-nosed').\n\n\n"}

Surviving labourers and other records confirmed that the prisoners and conscripts were forced to work in harsh, brutal conditions for little-to-no pay and that some died, at least in part, because of the ill-treatment at the mine.\n\nAlthough reported by Western media sources, former Prime Minister of Japan Taro Aso, whose immediate family owns the company, now called the Aso Group, repeatedly refused to confirm that his family's company had used forced labour until 2009 when it was acknowledged by the Japanese government. Since then, several surviving former Australian POWs have asked Aso and the company to apologise, but both have declined to do so.\n\nIn mid-2008 Taro Aso conceded that his family's coal mine, Aso Mining Company, was alleged to have forced Allied POWs to work in the mines in 1945 without pay. Western media had reported that 300 prisoners, including 197 Australians, 101 British, and two Dutch, worked in the mine. Two of the Australians, John Watson and Leslie Edgar George Wilkie, died while working in the Aso mine. In addition, 10,000 Korean conscripts worked in the mine between 1939 and 1945 under severe, brutal conditions in which many of them died or were injured while receiving little pay. Apart from Aso's admission, the Aso company has never acknowledged using forced labour or commented on the issue. The company, now known as the Aso Group, is currently run by Aso's younger brother. Aso's wife serves on its board of directors. Taro Aso was president of the Aso Mining Company's successor, Aso Cement Company, in the 1970s before entering politics.\n\nDuring the time that Aso served as minister of Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ministry refused to confirm non-Japanese accounts of the use of forced labour by Japanese companies and challenged non-Japanese journalists to back up their claims with evidence. In October 2008, Diet member Shoukichi Kina asked Aso whether any data about the use of Korean labour by Aso Mining had been provided to the South Korean government, which has requested such data. Aso replied that his administration would not disclose how individual corporations have responded to Korean inquiries.\n\nOn 13 November 2008, during a discussion in the Upper House Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defense about the Tamogami essay controversy, Aso refused to confirm that forced labour had been used at his family's mine, stating that, \"No facts have been confirmed.\" Aso added that, \"I was 4, maybe 5 at the time. I was too young to recognize anything at that age.\" After Yukihisa Fujita responded that records at the United States National Archives and Records Administration indicated that forced labour had taken place at his family's mine, Aso repeated that \"no factual details have been confirmed.\"\n\nActing on a request from Fujita, the Foreign Ministry investigated and announced on 18 December 2008 that Aso Mining had, in fact, used 300 Allied POWs at its mine during World War II. The ministry confirmed that two Australians had died while working at the mine, but declined to release their names or causes of deaths for \"privacy reasons.\" Said Fujita, \"Prisoner policy is important in many ways for diplomacy, and it is a major problem that the issue has been neglected for so long.\"\n\nIn February 2009, Fujita announced that he had interviewed three of the former Australian POWs forced to work at Aso Mining. All three confirmed that working conditions at the mine were terrible, that they were given little food, and were given \"rags\" to wear. The three veterans sent letters to Taro Aso demanding an apology for their treatment at Aso Mining and for refusing to acknowledge that forced POW labour was used by his family's company. The three also requested that the company pay them wages for the hours they worked. Fujita stated that Aso needed to apologise to the former labourers, as well as pay their wages if he cannot prove that money was paid, adding, \"As a prime minister of a nation who represents the country, Aso needs to take responsibility for the past as well as the future.\" Later that month, Aso conceded that his family's mine had used POW labour.\n\nIn June 2009, former POW Joseph Coombs and the son of another, James McAnulty, travelled to Japan to personally seek an apology from Aso. Said Coombs, \"We'd like an apology for the brutal treatment and the conditions we had to work under. The memory will always be there, but an apology will help ease some of the pain that we experienced.\" Aso Group officials met with Coombs and McAnulty, but declined to acknowledge that they had been forced to work for the company and apologise or offer compensation, even after Coombs and McAnulty showed the officials company records from 1946 which stated that POW labour had been used in the mine. Taro Aso refused to meet the pair.\n"}

It is the biggest iron meteorite ever found in Brazilian soil, weighting . It has been on display at the National Museum of Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro, since 1888.\n\nIt survived the fire that destroyed the museum in 2018, sustaining no major damage.\n\nThe Bendegó meteorite was found in 1784 by the boy Domingos da Motta Botelho, who grazed cattle on a farm near the present town of Monte Santo, Bahia. At the time of its finding, it was the second largest meteorite in the world. Judging from the four-inch layer of oxidation upon which it rested, and the lost part of its lower portion, it is estimated that it had been in place for thousands of years.\n\nNews of the finding were quick to spread. In 1785, governor D. Rodrigues Menezes arranged for it to be transported to Salvador, however, the meteorite's excessive weight made transportation difficult. The cart it was on ran out of control down a hill and the meteorite fell into a dry stream bed, 180 meters away from the spot where it was originally found. It remained there until 1888, when it was recovered and brought to the National Museum.\n\nThe meteorite is an irregular mass, reminding, in appearance, an asteroid. It has numerous depressions on the surface and cylindrical holes oriented parallel to its greater length. These holes were formed by the burning of the troilite, during the transatmospheric passage of the meteorite, since the sulfide has a lower melting point than the rest of the meteorite, consuming more quickly. It is a metallic meteorite, consisting basically of iron, with the following elements: 6.6% Ni, 0.47% Co, 0.22% P, and traces of S and C in much smaller quantities, only measured in parts by million.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3658685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3658685", "title": "Black Annis", "text": "Black Annis\n\nBlack Annis (also known as Black Agnes or Black Anna) is a bogeyman figure in English folklore. She is imagined as a blue-faced hag or witch with iron claws and a taste for human flesh (especially children). She is said to haunt the countryside of Leicestershire, living in a cave in the Dane Hills with a great oak tree at the entrance.\n\nShe is said to venture out at night looking for unsuspecting children and lambs to eat, then tanning their skins by hanging them on a tree before wearing them around her waist. She would reach inside houses to snatch people. Legend has it that she used her iron claws to dig her cave out of the side of a sandstone cliff, making herself a home there which is known as Black Annis' Bower Close. The legend led to parents warning their children that Black Annis would get them if they did not behave. She was also known to hide in the branches of her oak tree waiting to leap upon unsuspecting prey.\n\nOther traditions stated that when she ground her teeth people could hear her, giving them time to bolt their doors and keep away from the window. It is said that cottages in Leicestershire were purposely built with small windows so that Black Annis could only get a single arm inside. When she howled she could be heard five miles away, then the cottagers would fasten skins across the window and place protective herbs above it to keep themselves safe.\n\nThe earliest known written reference to Black Annis was from an eighteenth century title deed that referred to a parcel of land (or \"close\") as \"Black Anny's Bower Close\". The first volume of \"County Folklore\" (1895), published by The Folklore Society, mentions two such title deeds dated May 13th and 14th, 1764.\n\nThe Black Annis figure has several possible origins. Some have claimed, as T. C. Lethbridge did, that the origin can be found in Celtic mythology based on Danu (or Anu) or it may derive from Germanic mythology (see Hel). Donald Alexander Mackenzie in his 1917 book \"Myths of Crete and Pre-Hellenic Europe\" suggested the origin of the legend may go back to the mother goddess of ancient Europe which he contends was thought of as a devourer of children. He identified Black Annis as being similar to the Indic \"Kali\", Gaelic \"Muilearteach\" and \"Cailleach Bheare\", the Greek \"Demeter\", the Mesopotamian \"Labartu\", and the Egyptian \"Isis-Hathor\" and \"Neith\".\nIt has been suggested that the legend may derive from a popular memory of sacrifice to an ancient goddess.\nIt is thought that offerings of children may have been made to the goddess that inspired the legend in the archaeological Hunting Period, the oak tree at the cave's entrance also a common site of local meetings.\n\nRonald Hutton however disagrees with such theories in his book \"The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft\". He suggests that the Black Annis of Leicestershire legend was based on a real person named Agnes Scott, a late medieval anchoress (or by some accounts a Dominican nun who cared for a local leper colony), born in Little Antrum, who lived a life of prayer in a cave in the Dane Hills and was buried in the churchyard in Swithland. Hutton suggests that the memory of Scott was distorted into the image of Black Annis either to frighten local children or due to the anti-anchorite sentiment that arose from the Protestant Reformation. In the Victorian era the story of Agnes Scott, or Annis, became confused with the similarly named goddess Anu. Lethbridge made this connection and went on to claim that Annis was the personification of the Great Goddess in crone form, leading to interest from Wiccan groups.\n\nThe connection between Black Annis and Agnes Scott was made previous to Hutton, including the gravesite and cave, in an issue of the \"Leicester Chronicle\" dated Feb. 26th, 1842 and reprinted in the first volume of \"County Folklore\" (1895).\n\nMany of the modern conceptions of Black Annis were popularized in a poem by John Heyrick, given in full in \"County Folklore\" but excerpted here:\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n'Tis said the soul of mortal man recoiled\nTo view Black Annis' eye, so fierce and wild\nVast talons, foul with human flesh, there grew\nIn place of hands, and features livid blue\nGlared in her visage, whilst her obscene waist\nWarm skins of human victims close embraced\n\nNot without terror they the cave survey\nWhere hung the monstrous trophies of her sway\n'Tis said that in the rock large rooms were found\nScooped with her claws beneath the flinty ground\n</poem>\n\nBlack Annis was also represented in monstrous cat form, and the legend led to a local ritual in early spring when a dead cat would be dragged before a pack of hounds in front of her bower to celebrate the end of winter. According to Katharine Briggs this drag hunt was held on Easter Monday (also known as Black Monday) and led from Annis' Bower to the mayor of Leicester's house. The bait dragged was a dead cat drenched in aniseed. This custom died out at the end of the 18th century.\n\nAnother tradition stated that Black Annis (in the form of Cat Anna) lived in the cellars beneath Leicester Castle and that there was an underground passage extending from the cellars to the Dane Hills along which she ran.\n\nIn 1837 a play called \"Black Anna's Bower, or the Maniac of the Dane Hills\" was performed at the Leicester Theatre. The plot involved the murder of a landlady of the Blue Boar Inn, in which Black Anna played a part similar to that of the witches in \"Macbeth\".\n\n\n"}

Rogers was a two-time world champion, holding the top championship in both the NWA and the WWWF, today known as WWE (he was the inaugural WWWF World Heavyweight Champion). Rogers is one of three men in history to have held both world titles, along with Ric Flair and AJ Styles.\n\nRogers was the son of German immigrant parents. Rogers was athletic, and took up wrestling at age nine at the local YMCA. Rogers joined the Camden YMCA Wrestling League and won its heavyweight championship. He also excelled in football, boxing, track and swimming. In 1937, he won the YMCA's three-mile swimming championship. Rogers joined the Dale Brothers Circus as a wrestler at age 17. Rogers later worked at a shipyard, and became a police officer.\n\nRogers visited the offices of professional wrestling promoters Ray and Frank Hanley, who gave him his first match on July 4, 1939 against Moe Brazen, which he won. Rogers soon became a top professional wrestler using his real name around his hometown where he gained his first major win over Ed \"Strangler\" Lewis. Like many professional wrestlers, Rogers was likely not the height and weight listed, as he probably stood 5'11\" tall and weighed in at 195 pounds. He continued his career in Houston, where he assumed the name Buddy Rogers. Rogers would get his first title during his tenure there, winning the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship four times, once from Lou Thesz, beginning a long feud both in and out of the ring.\n\nAfter leaving the Texas territory for Columbus, Ohio, Rogers bleached his hair, and was given the moniker \"Natural Guy\" by promoter Jack Pfefer. The moniker later evolved to \"Nature Boy\". In the early 1950s, Lillian Ellison (under the moniker Slave Girl Moolah) worked as his valet. Ellison claims that the partnership ended after Rogers pushed for a sexual relationship, which Ellison refused. With the advent of television, Rogers' flashy look, great physique and bombastic personality instantly caught the ire of audiences. The first sign of Rogers' impact was his involvement in Sam Muchnick's opposition promotion in St. Louis, Missouri, a major professional wrestling market at the time. He was pitted against Lou Thesz as a draw. In the end, Muchnick's promotion was powerful enough with Rogers as its main star that the two promotions merged. Rogers continued control of the Midwest as a booker and professional wrestler, most notably in Chicago, frequently selling out the 11,000-seat arena. In the 1950s, Rogers expanded into Vince McMahon, Sr.'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC). He also wrestled in the Al Haft promotion out of Columbus, Ohio in the 1950s and through 1963.\n\nIn 1961, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) voted him into an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match. On June 30, 1961, Rogers took the title from Pat O'Connor in front of 38,622 fans at Comiskey Park, which set a new North American professional wrestling attendance record that stood until the David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions in 1984. In addition, the $148,000 gate in ticket sales was a professional wrestling record for almost twenty years. The contest, which was a two out of three falls match, was billed as the \"Match of the Century\", during which both men had gained a pinfall. However, when O'Connor missed a dropkick and hit his head, Rogers pinned him to win the match and being recognize as the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion. At the time, Rogers was working at two different jobs in Chicago, but he never walked into work again according to his autobiography.\n\nMany promoters felt that Rogers favored northeastern promoters over other territories. Promoters and noted shooters Bill Miller and Karl Gotch confronted Rogers in Columbus and broke his hand. Rogers sustained another injury in Montreal against Killer Kowalski, which kept Rogers on the sidelines. Upon his return, the NWA voted to switch the title back over to Lou Thesz, who publicly disliked Rogers. On January 24, 1963, the match took place in Toronto. Rogers was hesitant about dropping the title, so promoter Sam Muchnick put three safeguards in place to guarantee Rogers' cooperation. The first safeguard was formatting the match as a one fall finish, rather than the traditional best two out of three falls. The second safeguard was his threat to give Rogers' bond away to charity, rather than returning the deposit to the dethroned Rogers. Every NWA World Heavyweight Champion was required to pay a $25,000 deposit to the NWA Board of Directors, before winning the championship belt. The deposit was held by the NWA for the duration of the champion's reign. The third safeguard was Thesz, who could \"take\" the title if necessary. Ultimately, Thesz won the match and the title.\n\nRogers was a co-holder of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship with tag team partner \"Handsome\" Johnny Barend. They won the championship on July 5, 1962 from Johnny Valentine and \"Cowboy\" Bob Ellis on Capitol Wrestling's regular Thursday night Washington, D.C. television show. Arnold Skaaland was a last minute replacement for Ellis whose flight was delayed and unable to get to the arena. With the championship on the line, Rogers and Barend isolated Skaaland whom Rogers forced to submit with his figure-four leglock to win the first fall. After Skaaland was carried from the ring on a stretcher Valentine continued to fight alone in the second fall. Valentine fought valiantly, but was worn down by Rogers and Barend. Just when it looked like Valentine was going to succumb to the vicious attack of the heels the crowd erupted. The television cameras swung from a view of the ring to \"Cowboy\" Bob Ellis running down the aisle in street clothes and carrying a travel suitcase. Ellis jumped into the ring, applied multiple bulldog headlocks and pinned Barend to win the second fall for his team. The third fall featured everyone fighting inside and outside the ring. Finally, Ellis and Barend collided in the corner and knocked each other out. The referee was distracted by Valentine trying to get into the ring as Rogers grabbed an unconscious Barend by his hair and back of his trunks and threw him on top of Ellis for the victory. \n\nRogers and Barend defeated Valentine and Ellis in a title rematch at Madison Square Garden on July 13, 1962. They defended the championship until March 7, 1963 when they lost to Killer Buddy Austin and The Great Scott on Capitol Wrestling's regular Thursday night television broadcast. Rogers and Barend split briefly and feuded, but they reunited that summer to defeat Bobo Brazil and Bruno Sammartino in a best two out of three falls tag team match. During the Rogers-Barend feud, Rogers regularly teamed with a masked wrestler, The Shadow. Prior to his title reign with Barend, Rogers frequently teamed with the \"Big O\" Bob Orton. During the 1950s Rogers' main tag team partner was The Great Scott.\n\nAfter Thesz defeated Rogers for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, Northeast promoters Toots Mondt and Vince McMahon, Sr. withdrew their membership from the NWA and formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF, now WWE). The promoters felt that Thesz was not a strong draw in their territory, therefore the WWWF billed Rogers as their world champion as did Fred Kohler's Chicago promotion from January 25. \n\nRogers was formally recognized as the first ever WWWF World Heavyweight Champion on April 11, 1963 when promoter and first WWWF President Willie Gilzenberg handed Rogers the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship belt on Washington D.C. television. Gilzenberg explained that Rogers won a wrestling tournament in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, although it was fictional. WWE.com currently cites April 25, 1963 as the beginning of Rogers' reign. Rogers was a top draw, but his reign was ultimately cut short by a mild heart attack which greatly hindered his endurance and in-ring performance. Vince McMahon and Toots Mondt were in a panic and hid Rogers' medical problems. In an emergency title switch Rogers put over Bruno Sammartino in a quick 48 second match on May 17, 1963 in Madison Square Garden. The match had to be kept short for fear of Rogers having a major heart attack and dying in the ring. \n\nAfter putting over Sammartino, his health problems forced Rogers to wrestle in only a limited number of short singles matches that lasted a minute or two. He participated in a few tag team matches with partner Handsome Johnny Barend where he spent almost the entire match in his corner on the ring apron while Barend did the wrestling. Rogers defeated Hans \"The Great\" Mortier in less than a minute with the figure-four leglock in Madison Square Garden and teamed with Handsome Johnny Barend to take two out of three falls via pin from Sammartino and Bobo Brazil, with Rogers pinning Sammartino for the final fall. The big rematch was to be held October 4, 1963 at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City, New Jersey. The tickets were printed with Rogers–Sammartino on them. However, it was announced that Rogers was retiring and Gorilla Monsoon, who had won a tournament, got the title shot that night. In 1966-67 Rogers wrestled in 18 short matches in Canada. In 1969 Rogers appeared in 19 quick matches in an Ohio-based promotion called Wrestling Show Classics before he realized his health was not getting better to the point where he could wrestle. He spent time on television talking with his former manager Bobby Davis. A decade later Rogers would try to make a legitimate comeback.\n\nIn 1979, Rogers returned to wrestling as a fan favorite in Florida, although he was in his late 50s. He later moved up to Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in the Carolinas as a villain manager managing professional wrestlers like Jimmy Snuka, Ken Patera, Gene Anderson, Dewey Robertson and Big John Studd. His most notable moment during his run in the Carolinas was his feud with the new \"Nature Boy\" Ric Flair, before Rogers put over Flair on July 9, 1978.\n\nAfter his time in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW), he moved back into WWF where he was a fan favorite manager and part-time professional wrestler who also hosted the interview segment \"Rogers' Corner\" until 1983. Rogers was instrumental in helping turn Jimmy Snuka into a fan favorite, leading to Rogers managing Snuka for his feud with Lou Albano and Ray Stevens. During the feud, Rogers broke his hip and retired from professional wrestling for good. His show was replaced by \"Victory Corner\", which would later be replaced by \"Piper's Pit\". He would continue to make sporadic appearances in the WWF until 1984, right before the beginning of the Rock 'n' Wrestling era.\n\nHe was set to wrestle yet another \"Nature Boy\", this time Buddy Landel, in a comeback match for the Tri-State Wrestling Alliance (TWA, a predecessor of Extreme Championship Wrestling – ECW) in early 1992, but the promotion went out of business and the match never occurred. Later in the year, Rogers was weakened by a severe broken arm and suffered three strokes, two on the same day. He was put on life support and died a short time afterward on June 26, 1992.\n\nLou Thesz, Rogers' long-time colleague and frequent opponent, best described Rogers' early impact in his memoir, \"Hooker\": \"Rogers is remembered by fans and performers alike as one of the top all-time stars in the business, but it's probably not common knowledge just how influential he was... he broke into the business somewhere around 1941 as a hero-type personality, with little more going for him than a good body and natural charisma in the ring – which is actually a pretty good beginning – and he was a hit almost from the start. He had that indefinable something fans responded to, and he was sharp enough to build upon what he had, paying attention to what got a reaction from the fans. What evolved over several years was the 'Nature Boy', the prototype of the cocky, strutting, sneering, arrogant peroxide blond villain that is almost a tired wrestling cliché today. Rogers invented the character, and I believe he did it better than anyone\". Thesz continued, \"He was also one of the first guys to rely a lot on what we called 'flying' moves in the ring – body slams, dropkicks, piledrivers, ricochets off the ropes into his opponent, action moves that are commonplace today. All of those moves were in use before Rogers came along, but they were used sparingly; most of the wrestling prior to Rogers' emergence was done on the mat. Rogers was the first to use flying moves in quantity, staying off the mat, and the style was so popular with the fans that other wrestlers, including me, followed his lead\".\n\nAnother Rogers contribution to modern professional wrestling was his bombastic interviewing style. Professional wrestlers might talk and converse with interviewers, but Rogers bragged and boasted about how great he was and how pathetic his opponents were. After winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Pat O'Connor in Chicago in 1961, Rogers accepted the title belt and then took the microphone and shouted, \"To a nicer guy it couldn't happen!\". This type of bombastic style went over well with the fans and has been followed ever since. However, Rogers was not well liked during his prime years because he had a habit of taking advantage of opponents in the ring. During his prime years, he was known as much for his distinctive peacock-like strut as for his wrestling performance. He was also very skilled at drawing heat during interviews, with a smug \"to a nicer guy, it couldn't have happened\" being his catchphrase of sorts whenever he was victorious. He may have been the first authentic \"charismatic\" professional wrestler, who, along with almost equally charismatic Bobby Davis, would use cruel, yet hilarious, put-downs of his opponents, such as: \"After I get through with him, he'll be back driving a garbage truck where he belongs\". Almost like a tag team of pseudo-arrogance, Davis would incredulously say of Roger's opponents that they did not even deserve to be in the same ring as Rogers, bemoaning the fact that \"this is a sport of kings!\". Although he was viewed as a villain in most areas during most of his career, Rogers was always a fan favorite in cities throughout Ohio. This was probably due to his appearances for many years with the Al Haft Promotion who had their offices in Columbus.\n\nAccording to Thesz, Rogers, although admittedly an excellent professional wrestler and a superb showman, was a manipulative schemer behind the scenes and was fond of saying in private: \"Screw your friends and be nice to your enemies, so your enemies will become your friends, and then you can screw them too\". With age, however, Rogers mellowed and became a very respected veteran and spokesman for professional wrestling. Rogers had one of the longest consistent top drawing periods of any main eventer (15 years) and the ability to draw in several different territories successfully. In 1994, he was posthumously inducted into the World Wrestling Federation Hall of Fame class of 1994. Fellow professional wrestler Ric Flair from early in his career to the present day, adopted the \"Nature Boy\" gimmick from Rogers as a tribute to him. Even using Rogers' own signature move the figure-four leglock as his own, Flair even went as far as doing his own variation of the Rogers strut as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4194191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4194191", "title": "Cambridge Latin Course", "text": "Cambridge Latin Course\n\nThe Cambridge Latin Course (CLC) is a series of textbooks published by Cambridge University Press, used to teach Latin to secondary school students. First published in 1970, the series is now in its fifth edition, and has sold over 3.5 million copies. It has reached high status in the UK, being the most successful Latin course in the country and used by 85% of Latin-teaching schools.\n\nThe course consists of a series of chapters, each of which includes stories in Latin as well as vocabulary and grammar explained in English. There is a short history section at the end of each chapter to provide context on Ancient Rome.\n\nThe first story \"Cerberus\" begins:\n\n\"Caecilius est in horto. Caecilius in horto sedet. servus est in atrio. servus in atrio laborat.\"\n\nwhich means, in English:\n\nCaecilius is in the garden. Caecilius is sitting in the garden. The slave is in the atrium. The slave is working in the atrium.\n\nThe book tells the adventures of Caecilius, a banker and paterfamilias in Pompeii from the reign of Nero to that of Vespasian. Sometimes the book deviates, to talk about Caecilius's two slaves, Grumio and Clemens, and their frequent humorous mishaps. The book also discusses Metella (Caecilius's wife) and her slave Melissa. The book ends when Mount Vesuvius erupts, and Caecilius and Cerberus are killed in Pompeii. However, the book leaves the reader wondering whether Caecilius' son, Quintus, survived, as indeed he did, along with the slave, Clemens. Cerberus is Caecilius' guard dog; he sits by his master as the volcano erupts. The beginning of the book is very simple, but each stage develops more complicated grammar and vocabulary. This book introduces the nominative, dative and accusative cases and different verb tenses including present, perfect and imperfect. \n\nThe beginning of the second book is set in Roman Britain near Fishbourne Roman Palace under Agricola, where Quintus meets Salvius and King Cogidubnus, who are historical figures. The book starts by introducing a new family, a Roman aristocrat, Salvius, who is a successful lawyer and senator in Rome. His family includes his wife, Rufilla, and many slaves, some of whom are Britons, others foreign. \nIn the second half of the book, Quintus tells King Cogidubnus about his journey to Alexandria, where he met Barbillus, a friend of his father. Barbillus later dies of a wound during a hunting trip, and tells Quintus to find his son Rufus, who lives in Britain, thus explaining the reason for Quintus' visit.\n\nThe third book picks up in the Roman province of Britain, in the city of Aquae Sulis (Bath) in particular. Cogidubnus falls ill and goes to the baths at Aquae Sulis, and Salvius, seeing his chance, hatches a plot with the baths' owner, Lucius Marcius Memor, to kill him. Quintus foils the plan, much to Salvius' dismay. He also finds Barbillus' son Rufus and gives him a message. When Cogidubnus eventually dies in captivity, Salvius writes a false will for him.\nA continuous narrative throughout the book also includes Modestus and Strythio, two bumbling Romans in the military.\n\nIn the fourth textbook, the setting moves to Rome, a few years after the events in Britain. Quintus is absent, and the main characters are Salvius, his ally Haterius, and several other Roman aristocrats, as well as some ordinary citizens. Salvius coordinates the death of Paris, a famous pantomime actor, and exiles Domitia, the emperor's wife, whose affair with Paris was exposed.\n\nThe book is set in Rome, after Agricola has successfully conquered Scotland. Various acquaintances of the emperor, including Glabrio, an advisor to the emperor, are introduced, as well as the emperor himself. Glabrio accuses Salvius of the forgery of Cogidubnus' will, while Domitia accuses him of plotting her exile. Quintus is present at Salvius' trial. Salvius is convicted and sentenced to five years of exile. In the remaining chapters, the writings of various poets and historical figures replace the narrative.\n\nTo suit the American format, books III and IV were combined.\n\nCaecilius is the star of the first book. Caecilius is a banker who lives in Pompeii. When the volcano Mt. Vesuvius erupts near Pompeii, Caecilius returns to save his family. A wall falls on him in his house and he tragically dies.\nThe son of Lucius Caecilius Iucundus and Metella, Quintus is the main character of Cambridge Latin. He escapes Pompeii and in the second book goes to Alexandria, Egypt, where he is assigned to find the dying Barbillus' son Rufus. In the third book, he finds Rufus, but also becomes entangled in a plot against King Cogidubnus. Quintus appears once more in the final book, where he is present for the trial of Salvius.\nGaius Salvius Liberalis, a distant relative of Quintus, first appears in the second book. He is a cruel man who is not capable of loving anything besides making others suffer. In the third book, it is revealed that he is conspiring against King Cogidubnus. In the fourth book, he becomes part of yet another conspiracy, which is no surprise, to exile the philandering Domitia and murder her lover Paris. In the final book, he is put on trial for his crimes and is deservedly sentenced to five years of exile.\nCogidubnus is a client king of Britain. First appearing in the second book, he becomes a close friend of Quintus. Cogidubnus becomes ill, and it is revealed that his advisor, Salvius, is trying to murder him. Although the conspiracy fails, Cogidubnus dies in captivity of his illness. Salvius attributed his terrible actions to the fact that he could no longer feel any feelings.\nBelimicus is the chieftain of the Cantiaci tribe who first appears in the second book. Throughout the books he is insanely jealous of Dumnorix, the chieftain of the Regnenses. (Dumnorix is later killed when he attempts to seek help from the governor of Britain, Agricola.) He helps Salvius in his plot to kill Cogidubnus, but begins to rebel against Salvius's authority, as he feels he deserves the kingship. Belimicus is murdered by Salvius with poison.\nHaterius is a rich client and friend of Salvius who appears first in the fourth book. He constructs the arch of Titus for Domitian. He appears again, briefly, in the fifth book, in which he follows Salvius into exile.\nEmperor Domitian first appears in the fourth book, briefly, although he had been mentioned several times before. Domitian is the one whom Salvius takes orders from. Although Domitian instigated the crimes, Salvius does not implicate the emperor in order to save his son.\n\n\nThe popularity of the Cambridge Latin Course is such that the series has been indirectly referenced in television. The ancillary characters Caecilius, Metella and Quintus in the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Fires of Pompeii\" are loosely based on those from the Cambridge Latin Course. In the opening episode of series four of \"Being Human\" the \"Vampire Recorder\" blurts out words from Book One of the Cambridge Latin Course, (\"Caecilius est in horto!\") as part of the general nonsense he is chanting whilst pretending to perform a sacrificial ceremony.\n\nGrumio is the name of the slave in the TV series \"Plebs\".\n\n"}

Such study can take a descriptive, historical, or political approach. It studies the similarities and differences in structure, goals, punishment and emphasis on rights as well as the history and political stature of different systems. It is common to broadly categorize the functions of a criminal justice system into policing, adjudication (i.e.: courts), and corrections, although other categorization schemes exist. Comparativists study the four different types of societies, their methods of enforcement and their different types of punishment such as capital punishment, and imprisonment. Within these societies they study different types of legal tradition and analyze the issues they solve and create. They use their information in order to learn effective ways of enforcing laws, and to identify and solve problems that may arise within a system due to its methods.\n\nComparativists in criminal justice study four different kinds of societies: Folk-communal, Urban-commercial, Urban-industrial, and bureaucratic. Folk-communal societies are often seen as primitive and barbaric, they have little specialization among law enforcers, and let many problems go unpunished to avoid over-criminalization however, once tempers “boil over” and the situation becomes a larger issue, harsh and unusual punishment may be administered. Examples are African or Middle Eastern Tribes, or early puritan settlements of America. Urban-commercial societies have few written laws and some specialized enforcement for religious or king’s law enforcement. Punishments are inconsistent and usually harsh. Urban-industrial societies enforce laws that prescribe good behavior and give incentives and disincentives for behavior and police are specialized in property crimes such as theft. Finally, bureaucratic societies are today’s modern society. They feature fully developed laws, lawyers, and police forces trained for multiple types of crime. Different “side effects” of these societies include over-criminalization, overcrowding, and even juvenile delinquency due to the extended age of adolescence these societies bring on.\n\nLegal traditions play an important role in the development of international law and justice. Comparativists for criminal justice study these traditions with the intent of finding a way to combine the views of different traditions towards a single view that allows for the successful development of international law. Many comparativists believe that the more states with similar legal views the more likely it is to be able to create international laws that please all.\nReichel (2005) identifies four major legal traditions that each have their own respective body of laws:\n\nPeople who study comparative criminal justice study different forms and use of punishment across societies, including capital punishment. Fifty-nine countries retain the death penalty as reported in 2007. Comparativists study the different ways in which execution is carried out across the world including hanging, shooting, beheading, injection, electrocution, and even stoning. Comparativists find that in many developing countries such as Iran, Indonesia, Belarus, and many others, that violent methods of execution such as hanging beheading, shooting, and stoning are much more common ways of carrying out the death penalty, and in many cases the only ways. However in western culture as well as developed countries such as the United States less brutal execution such as lethal injection is utilized. Even prison sentences can come harshly. In many countries such as Burma a person can be sentenced to prison for merely disagreeing with the government. Presumably ridiculous sentences such as multiple life sentences or sentences of hundreds, even thousands of years are meant to prohibit the chance of parole in the future. Although it may seem preposterous, western cultures carry out the same type of sentencing.\nEven though similar sentences are used across the globe leniency is varied widely between societies. Many governments such as the one mentioned above in Burma provide swift and heavy punishment to assert their roles of power.\n\n"}

{"id": "325077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=325077", "title": "Domain theory", "text": "Domain theory\n\nDomain theory is a branch of mathematics that studies special kinds of partially ordered sets (posets) commonly called domains. Consequently, domain theory can be considered as a branch of order theory. The field has major applications in computer science, where it is used to specify denotational semantics, especially for functional programming languages. Domain theory formalizes the intuitive ideas of approximation and convergence in a very general way and has close relations to topology. \n\nAn alternative important approach to denotational semantics in computer science is that of metric spaces.\n\nThe primary motivation for the study of domains, which was initiated by Dana Scott in the late 1960s, was the search for a denotational semantics of the lambda calculus. In this formalism, one considers \"functions\" specified by certain terms in the language. In a purely syntactic way, one can go from simple functions to functions that take other functions as their input arguments. Using again just the syntactic transformations available in this formalism, one can obtain so called fixed-point combinators (the best-known of which is the Y combinator); these, by definition, have the property that \"f\"(Y(\"f\")) = Y(\"f\") for all functions \"f\".\n\nTo formulate such a denotational semantics, one might first try to construct a \"model\" for the lambda calculus, in which a genuine (total) function is associated with each lambda term. Such a model would formalize a link between the lambda calculus as a purely syntactic system and the lambda calculus as a notational system for manipulating concrete mathematical functions. The combinator calculus is such a model. However, the elements of the combinator calculus are functions from functions to functions; in order for the elements of a model of the lambda calculus to be of arbitrary domain and range, they could not be true functions, only partial functions.\n\nScott got around this difficulty by formalizing a notion of \"partial\" or \"incomplete\" information to represent computations that have not yet returned a result. This was modeled by considering, for each domain of computation (e.g. the natural numbers), an additional element that represents an \"undefined\" output, i.e. the \"result\" of a computation that never ends. In addition, the domain of computation is equipped with an \"ordering relation\", in which the \"undefined result\" is the least element.\n\nThe important step to find a model for the lambda calculus is to consider only those functions (on such a partially ordered set) which are guaranteed to have least fixed points. The set of these functions, together with an appropriate ordering, is again a \"domain\" in the sense of the theory. But the restriction to a subset of all available functions has another great benefit: it is possible to obtain domains that contain their own function spaces, i.e. one gets functions that can be applied to themselves.\n\nBeside these desirable properties, domain theory also allows for an appealing intuitive interpretation. As mentioned above, the domains of computation are always partially ordered. This ordering represents a hierarchy of information or knowledge. The higher an element is within the order, the more specific it is and the more information it contains. Lower elements represent incomplete knowledge or intermediate results.\n\nComputation then is modeled by applying monotone functions repeatedly on elements of the domain in order to refine a result. Reaching a fixed point is equivalent to finishing a calculation. Domains provide a superior setting for these ideas since fixed points of monotone functions can be guaranteed to exist and, under additional restrictions, can be approximated from below.\n\nIn this section, the central concepts and definitions of domain theory will be introduced. The above intuition of domains being \"information orderings\" will be emphasized to motivate the mathematical formalization of the theory. The precise formal definitions are to be found in the dedicated articles for each concept. A list of general order-theoretic definitions which include domain theoretic notions as well can be found in the order theory glossary. The most important concepts of domain theory will nonetheless be introduced below.\n\nAs mentioned before, domain theory deals with partially ordered sets to model a domain of computation. The goal is to interpret the elements of such an order as \"pieces of information\" or \"(partial) results of a computation\", where elements that are higher in the order extend the information of the elements below them in a consistent way. From this simple intuition it is already clear that domains often do not have a greatest element, since this would mean that there is an element that contains the information of \"all\" other elements—a rather uninteresting situation.\n\nA concept that plays an important role in the theory is that of a directed subset of a domain; a directed subset is a non-empty subset of the order in which any two elements have an upper bound that is an element of this subset. In view of our intuition about domains, this means that any two pieces of information within the directed subset are \"consistently\" extended by some other element in the subset. Hence we can view directed subsets as \"consistent specifications\", i.e. as sets of partial results in which no two elements are contradictory. This interpretation can be compared with the notion of a convergent sequence in analysis, where each element is more specific than the preceding one. Indeed, in the theory of metric spaces, sequences play a role that is in many aspects analogous to the role of directed sets in domain theory.\n\nNow, as in the case of sequences, we are interested in the \"limit\" of a directed set. According to what was said above, this would be an element that is the most general piece of information that extends the information of all elements of the directed set, i.e. the unique element that contains \"exactly\" the information that was present in the directed set, and nothing more. In the formalization of order theory, this is just the least upper bound of the directed set. As in the case of limits of sequences, least upper bounds of directed sets do not always exist.\n\nNaturally, one has a special interest in those domains of computations in which all consistent specifications \"converge\", i.e. in orders in which all directed sets have a least upper bound. This property defines the class of directed-complete partial orders, or dcpo for short. Indeed, most considerations of domain theory do only consider orders that are at least directed complete.\n\nFrom the underlying idea of partially specified results as representing incomplete knowledge, one derives another desirable property: the existence of a least element. Such an element models that state of no information—the place where most computations start. It also can be regarded as the output of a computation that does not return any result at all.\n\nNow that we have some basic formal descriptions of what a domain of computation should be, we can turn to the computations themselves. Clearly, these have to be functions, taking inputs from some computational domain and returning outputs in some (possibly different) domain. However, one would also expect that the output of a function will contain more information when the information content of the input is increased. Formally, this means that we want a function to be monotonic.\n\nWhen dealing with dcpos, one might also want computations to be compatible with the formation of limits of a directed set. Formally, this means that, for some function \"f\", the image \"f\"(\"D\") of a directed set \"D\" (i.e. the set of the images of each element of \"D\") is again directed and has as a least upper bound the image of the least upper bound of \"D\". One could also say that \"f\" \"preserves directed suprema\". Also note that, by considering directed sets of two elements, such a function also has to be monotonic. These properties give rise to the notion of a Scott-continuous function. Since this often is not ambiguous one also may speak of \"continuous functions\".\n\nDomain theory is a purely \"qualitative\" approach to modeling the structure of information states. One can say that something contains more information, but the amount of additional information is not specified. Yet, there are some situations in which one wants to speak about elements that are in a sense much simpler (or much more incomplete) than a given state of information. For example, in the natural subset-inclusion ordering on some powerset, any infinite element (i.e. set) is much more \"informative\" than any of its \"finite\" subsets.\n\nIf one wants to model such a relationship, one may first want to consider the induced strict order < of a domain with order ≤. However, while this is a useful notion in the case of total orders, it does not tell us much in the case of partially ordered sets. Considering again inclusion-orders of sets, a set is already strictly smaller than another, possibly infinite, set if it contains just one less element. One would, however, hardly agree that this captures the notion of being \"much simpler\".\n\nA more elaborate approach leads to the definition of the so-called order of approximation, which is more suggestively also called the way-below relation. An element \"x\" is \"way below\" an element \"y\", if, for every directed set \"D\" with supremum such that\n\nthere is some element \"d\" in \"D\" such that\n\nThen one also says that \"x\" \"approximates\" \"y\" and writes\n\nThis does imply that\n\nsince the singleton set {\"y\"} is directed. For an example, in an ordering of sets, an infinite set is way above any of its finite subsets. On the other hand, consider the directed set (in fact: the chain) of finite sets\n\nSince the supremum of this chain is the set of all natural numbers N, this shows that no infinite set is way below N.\n\nHowever, being way below some element is a \"relative\" notion and does not reveal much about an element alone. For example, one would like to characterize finite sets in an order-theoretic way, but even infinite sets can be way below some other set. The special property of these finite elements \"x\" is that they are way below themselves, i.e.\n\nAn element with this property is also called compact. Yet, such elements do not have to be \"finite\" nor \"compact\" in any other mathematical usage of the terms. The notation is nonetheless motivated by certain parallels to the respective notions in set theory and topology. The compact elements of a domain have the important special property that they cannot be obtained as a limit of a directed set in which they did not already occur.\n\nMany other important results about the way-below relation support the claim that this definition is appropriate to capture many important aspects of a domain.\n\nThe previous thoughts raise another question: is it possible to guarantee that all elements of a domain can be obtained as a limit of much simpler elements? This is quite relevant in practice, since we cannot compute infinite objects but we may still hope to approximate them arbitrarily closely.\n\nMore generally, we would like to restrict to a certain subset of elements as being sufficient for getting all other elements as least upper bounds. Hence, one defines a base of a poset \"P\" as being a subset \"B\" of \"P\", such that, for each \"x\" in \"P\", the set of elements in \"B\" that are way below \"x\" contains a directed set with supremum \"x\". The poset \"P\" is a \"continuous poset\" if it has some base. Especially, \"P\" itself is a base in this situation. In many applications, one restricts to continuous (d)cpos as a main object of study.\n\nFinally, an even stronger restriction on a partially ordered set is given by requiring the existence of a base of \"compact\" elements. Such a poset is called algebraic. From the viewpoint of denotational semantics, algebraic posets are particularly well-behaved, since they allow for the approximation of all elements even when restricting to finite ones. As remarked before, not every finite element is \"finite\" in a classical sense and it may well be that the finite elements constitute an uncountable set.\n\nIn some cases, however, the base for a poset is countable. In this case, one speaks of an ω-continuous poset. Accordingly, if the countable base consists entirely of finite elements, we obtain an order that is ω-algebraic.\n\nA simple special case of a domain is known as an elementary or flat domain. This consists of a set of incomparable elements, such as the integers, along with a single \"bottom\" element considered smaller than all other elements.\n\nOne can obtain a number of other interesting special classes of ordered structures that could be suitable as \"domains\". We already mentioned continuous posets and algebraic posets. More special versions of both are continuous and algebraic cpos. Adding even further completeness properties one obtains continuous lattices and algebraic lattices, which are just complete lattices with the respective properties. For the algebraic case, one finds broader classes of posets which are still worth studying: historically, the Scott domains were the first structures to be studied in domain theory. Still wider classes of domains are constituted by SFP-domains, L-domains, and bifinite domains.\n\nAll of these classes of orders can be cast into various categories of dcpos, using functions which are monotone, Scott-continuous, or even more specialized as morphisms. Finally, note that the term \"domain\" itself is not exact and thus is only used as an abbreviation when a formal definition has been given before or when the details are irrelevant.\n\nA poset \"D\" is a dcpo if and only if each chain in \"D\" has a supremum.\n\nIf \"f\" is a continuous function on a domain \"D\" then it has a least fixed point, given as the least upper bound of all finite iterations of \"f\" on the least element ⊥:\n\nThis is the Kleene fixed-point theorem. The formula_8 symbol is the directed join.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The three online platforms hipages Group oversees includes; hipages, which operates in the home improvement space; Pet Pages, which operates in the pet services sector; and Natural Therapy Pages, which operates in the domain of natural therapies.\n\nhipages was founded in 2004 by Chief Executive Officer, David Vitek and Chief Operations Officer, Roby Sharon-Zipser. Prior to hipages, Vitek worked as an electrical engineer at IBM and Sharon-Zipser worked for PWC, then later started his own business advisory firm.\n\nBy 2013, over one million visitors were navigating to the hipages site, with over 40,000 tradies already listed on the directory. In the same year, hipages entered into a partnership with IKEA to assist consumers in locating tradesmen to install their kitchen benches and cabinets.\n\nIn 2014, Ashok Jacob-led Ellerston Capital acquired a 14% stake in the business, and in December, 2015 News Corp Australia acquired a 25% stake; the biggest investment for the company to date. These two significant investments increased hipages value to over $100 million with a growth rate of 30% year-on-year. Along the way, other investments came from KTM Capital, Right Click Capital and Kresta Capital. To date, hipages has raised over $50 million in funding. \nToday, hipages facilitates over 100,000 jobs posted by customers each month, with over 1.5 million monthly visitors to the website. Over 90,000 professional tradesmen are listed on the platform offering services across 1,300 home improvement categories. By the end of the 2017 financial year, hipages generated $2 billion worth of work for Australian tradespeople making the website the number one site for finding and hiring tradespeople in Australia.\n\nCurrently, hipages operates in both Sydney and Manila, with over 155 employees in each office. Vitek and Sharon-Zipser extended hipages to Philippines in November 2014.\n\nThe hipages Group owns and operates three online service directories across three different industries; home improvements, pet services and natural therapies. Each directory generates revenue from member fees, where professionals in each of these fields pay a fee to be listed as a business on the respective platform and can connect with local consumers in need of a particular service.\n\nThe name hipages stems from a portmanteau of Home Improvement Pages. hipages offers directory services that connect homeowners to registered tradespeople from 1,300 categories including plumbing, building, painting, tiling, electrical work, handyman work, garden maintenance, air conditioning, concreting and other home repair jobs.\n\nCurrently through the hipages platform, over 90,000 tradies are listed on the directory with more than 100,000 jobs posted every month by homeowners. More than 1.5 million people visit the hipages website every month, generating $2 billion worth of work over the last financial year.\n\nhipages is the number one service provider in the Australian home improvement market, based on the company's growth, worth, the number of tradespeople listed on the directory, and the number of homeowners actively using the site.\n\nOver 100,000 job are posted on hipages by Australian customers per month. In May 2015, hipages reported $1.35 billion in job value on its platform over a 12-month period.\n\nNatural Therapy Pages was the first business developed in 2004 under the hipages Group umbrella. The idea for Natural Therapy Pages came from Vitek's interest in health and his desire to start his own business. Natural Therapy Pages features relevant health, nutrition and naturopathy articles along with a robust directory linking consumers to treatment facilities, doctors, practitioners and other natural therapy providers in the health and wellness space.\n\nThe Pet Pages website is a directory service that allows consumers to find local pet services and businesses in their area. Breeders, veterinarians, pet stores, pet accessory shops, and pet training services are among some of the businesses that can be found through Pet Pages.\n\n"}
{"id": "3701248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3701248", "title": "Höfle Telegram", "text": "Höfle Telegram\n\nThe Höfle Telegram (or Hoefle Telegram) is a cryptic one-page document, discovered in 2000 among the declassified World War II archives of the Public Record Office in Kew, England. The document consists of several cables in translation, among them a top-secret message sent by \"SS Sturmbannführer\" Hermann Höfle on 11 January 1943; one, to \"SS Obersturmbannführer\" Adolf Eichmann in Berlin, and one to \"SS Obersturmbannführer\" Franz Heim in German-occupied Kraków (Cracow).\n\nThe Telegram contains the detailed statistics on the 1942 killings of Jews in the extermination camps of Operation Reinhard including at Belzec (B), Sobibor (S), Treblinka (T), and at Lublin-Majdanek (L). The numbers were compiled and quoted by Höfle likely from the very precise records shared with the \"Deutsche Reichsbahn\" (DRG). Even though the Holocaust train-records were notoriously incomplete as revealed by the Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes against the Polish Nation, the quoted numbers shed a new light on the evidential standard of proof for the scope of the crimes committed by the SS. The telegram gave train arrivals in the prior fortnight, as well as cumulative arrivals until 31 December 1942, for the extermination camps during the most deadly phase of the \"Final Solution\".\n\nAll Holocaust trains were run by the \"Deutsche Reichsbahn\". The SS paid German Railways the equivalent of a third class ticket for every prisoner transported via the Holocaust trains (\"Sonderzüge\") to the extermination camps of Operation Reinhard from Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe and Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland. Children under four went free. The payment was collected from the SS by the German Transport Authority on behalf of the \"Reichsbahn\" according to a schedule, at a cost of 4 Pfennig per track kilometer. The actual waybills did not include the number of prisoners in each cattle car because calculations were predetermined. The standard means of delivery was a 10 metre long covered goods wagon, although third class passenger carriages were also used with train tickets paid by the Jews themselves, when the \"SS\" wanted to keep up the \"resettlement to work in the East\" myth. The DRB railway manual, which was used by the \"SS\" for making payments, had a listed carrying capacity of each trainset setup at 50 boxcars, each loaded with 50 prisoners.\n\nIn reality, boxcars were crammed with up to 100 persons and routinely loaded from the minimum of 150% to 200% capacity for the same price. Notably, during the mass deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka in 1942, trains carried up to 7,000 victims each, which reduced the cost to the SS by more than half. According to an expert report established on behalf of the German \"Train of Commemoration\" project, the receipts taken in by the state-owned \"Deutsche Reichsbahn\" for mass deportations in the period between 1938 and 1945 reached a sum of US $664,525,820.34.\n\nThe Höfle Telegram is a decoded message, encrypted at source by the German Enigma machine. A missing \"5\" is added in the table, and is considered to be the correct figure, because only the number 713,555 yields the correct total of 1,274,166, and also the Korherr Report of 1943 substantiates that the total number of 1,274,166 Jews subjected to \"special treatment\" (Sonderbehandlung) in the General Government district of German-occupied Poland is correct to the last incongruous digit. The British decoded version of the Telegram would almost certainly be a transcription error, since British security clearly did not realise what this message was about (see above). It is unlikely that the numerical mistake would have been noticed by them at the time. Admittedly the interception and decoding was not 100% accurate (see reproduction).\nAccording to the US National Security Agency and the Holocaust historians, \"it appears the British analysts who had decrypted the message missed the significance of this particular message at the time. No doubt this happened because the message itself contained only the identifying letters for the extermination camps followed by the numerical totals. The only clue would have been the reference to Operation Reinhard, the meaning of which – the plan to eliminate Polish Jewry that was named after the assassinated SS General Reinhard Heydrich – also probably was unknown at the time to the codebreakers at Bletchley.\"\n\nThe Höfle's radio telegram is one of two evidential proofs making use of the very precise figures, suggesting their common origin; the other one is the Korherr Report to Himmler by professional statistician Dr Richard Korherr from January 1943. Both of them quote exactly the same number of Jews \"processed\" during Operation Reinhard. Apart from providing identical totals as of December 31, 1942, the Höfle Telegram also indicates that the camp at Lublin (Majdanek) was part of Odilo Globocnik's Operation Reinhard, a fact that historians previously had not fully realised.\n"}
{"id": "4040618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4040618", "title": "Japanification", "text": "Japanification\n\nJapanification () is the process of becoming or wishing to become a member of Japanese society. It most commonly refers to expats living for an extended period of time in Japan, though it may also be used to describe persons living outside Japan who have a certain affinity to some aspect of Japanese culture. Cultural assimilation could include adoption of Japanese mannerisms, , taste in , and sometimes aspects of Japanese language.\n\nIn expats this process often occurs because of a feeling of isolation or desire to conform, whereas outside Japan it may occur because of an especially strong interest in some kind of fan culture based in Japan, e.g. anime, manga, television dramas, music or lolita fashion.\n\nJapanese culture has had a strong influence on American popular culture dating back to Japan's defeat in World War II and to the early 1950s when children of the United States were first introduced to Japanese popular culture, such as Godzilla. The Japanese culture also presented itself in popular video games such as Jet Set Radio, a game that has evident references to Japanese manga and graphic novels. This trend of Japan influencing children’s popular culture continues with well-known icons such as Astro Boy, Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, Pokémon, and Hello Kitty. Japanese media is commonly described as Kawaii, a Japanese term meaning “cute” and \"comfortable\" in English.\n\nAs more and more people became interested in Japanese society, the numbers of students and individuals learning the Japanese language increased. At its height of popularity there was a 10.3% increase in Japanese language enrollments in U.S. colleges and universities between 2006 and 2009, 66,605 in 2006 to 73,434 in 2009. However, the Japan Foundation statistics indicate that the number of people taking the Japanese Language Proficency Test (JLPT) has been steadily declining since the peak in 2009.\n\nThis temporary increase in Japanese language learners in the early years of the 21st century was unusual given Japan’s economic gloom and turmoil in the last two decades, but then again it might not be that surprising due to the rising popularity of manga and anime around 2009. Manga and anime was seen by some as a leading factor in reasons why the number of Japanese language learners was increasing, “Over 50% of Japanese language learners surveyed by the Japan Foundation in 2009 cited wanting to learn how to read manga and anime as a key reason for studying Japanese.” Today, we see what many consider is a rapid decline in the global popularity of Japanese manga and anime. Some praise the 10% of high quality manga and anime for its initial popularity, and blame its recent decline in popularity on the 90% of low quality material that has been released in recent years. Another possible reason for the decline in sales could be the increase in \"Scanlations\" which are described in a statement by Japan's Digital Comic Association: \"The 36 publishers in Japan’s Digital Comic Association and several American publishers are forming a coalition to combat the “rampant and growing problem” of scanlations — illicit digital copies of manga either translated by fans or scanned directly from legitimate English releases\".\n\nIn Taiwan, the term (\"harizu\") is used, which means \"the tribe that adores Japan.\" The term is taken from (Hari Kyoko), a female Taiwanese manga author.\n\nDue to Japanese war crimes such as the Nanking Massacre and the atrocities committed in Korea under Japanese rule, anti-Japanese sentiment is much stronger in mainland China and Korea than in Taiwan, where the Japanese colonization is not remembered as bitterly.\n\nIn addition to its cultural definition this process can be described as the transformation of an economy into one that follows the steps of Japan. In other words, it is a term used by economists that refers to falling into the same deflationary trap of collapsed demand that caused the Lost decade (Japan). Japanification is an ongoing issue today as the U.S., U.K., and other countries go through similar economic issues.\n\n"}

Lawler is a one-time AWA World Heavyweight Champion and a three-time WCWA World Heavyweight Champion. He unified the titles by defeating Kerry Von Erich at Superclash III, forming the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship, a championship which he held 28 times. Lawler has held more recognized championships than any professional wrestler in history, though he has never won any championships in WWE having wrestled sporadically whilst primarily providing color commentary, since joining the company. In 2007, Lawler was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nWhile working in Memphis, Tennessee, as a disc jockey, Lawler's artistic ability attracted the attention of local wrestling promoter Aubrey Griffith. The two made an agreement in which Lawler would give Griffith free publicity in exchange for free wrestling training. Lawler debuted as a wrestler in 1970, and won his first championship in September 1971 by winning a battle royal. He soon won the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship under the managerial service of Sam Bass with partner Jim White. In 1974, Lawler began feuding with Jackie Fargo, who had been his trainer and mentor. This led to a match for the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship. On July 24, 1974, Lawler won the belt and the title of \"King of Wrestling.\" During 1975, Lawler teamed with a variety of partners such as Mr Wrestling II, Don Greene, and Bob Orton, Jr. He won the NWA Macon Tag Team Championship twice during this period. While Lawler began his career as a heel, he became a face after splitting from Bass at the end of 1974. On November 12, 1979, while working in the Continental Wrestling Association, Lawler defeated Superstar Billy Graham to become the CWA World Champion. In 1980, coming off the back end of a feud with The Fabulous Freebirds, his career was put on hold due to a broken leg, but he returned to the ring after several months.\n\nIn 1982, Lawler began a notorious feud with comedian Andy Kaufman. At the time, Kaufman wrestled women as part of his skits and had declared himself the Intergender Heavyweight Champion. On April 5, Lawler, who had taken exception to the skits, wrestled Kaufman in Memphis. During the course of the match, Lawler delivered two piledrivers to his opponent, sending him to the hospital. On July 29, Lawler slapped Kaufman in the face on an episode of \"Late Night with David Letterman\". Kaufman responded by throwing his coffee on Lawler.\n\nYears later, Lawler appeared as himself in the Kaufman biopic \"Man on the Moon\"; the movie revealed that Lawler's feud with Kaufman had been kayfabe (staged). Lawler later claimed that not only was his entire feud with Kaufman staged, but also the two were actually very good friends.\n\nOn March 7, 1983, Lawler won the AWA International Championship by defeating Austin Idol. He defeated Ken Patera on July 25 to begin his second reign as the International Champion. Lawler became the NWA Mid America Champion on April 12, 1984, when he defeated Randy Savage for the title. In 1985, Lawler traveled to Japan, where he won the Polynesian Pacific title on January 25, 1986. He later returned to the United States, where he defeated Bill Dundee on July 29, 1986, to begin a new reign as the AWA International Champion. Lawler feuded with Tommy Rich, Austin Idol, and Paul E. Dangerously throughout early 1987. The animosity began after controversy over an AWA World Championship title shot involving Nick Bockwinkel. During the feud, the trio defeated Lawler in a steel cage match and cut his hair, which caused a riot in the Mid-South Coliseum.\n\nLawler won the AWA World Heavyweight Championship from Curt Hennig on May 9, 1988. During his reign, Lawler feuded with World Class Championship Wrestling's Champion Kerry Von Erich. He defeated Von Erich on December 15, 1988, at Superclash III to unify the two titles. Soon after, Lawler's issues with Verne Gagne led to his departure from the AWA. In 1991 and 1992, while working in the United States Wrestling Association, Lawler teamed with Jeff Jarrett in a match against The Moondogs over the USWA World Tag Team Championship.\n\nLawler began his WWF career in December 1992 as an announcer on \"Superstars\". From 1993 to 1995, he feuded with Bret Hart and the rest of the Hart family. The feud began at King of the Ring when Lawler interrupted Hart's victory ceremony and attacked Bret. Lawler claimed that he was the only true king in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and the two were scheduled to wrestle at SummerSlam to settle the dispute. At the event, however, Lawler came to the ring on crutches and claimed that he could not wrestle because of injuries suffered in a car accident. Hart faced Lawler's \"court jester\", Doink the Clown instead, and beat him by submission. Lawler then attacked Hart, revealing that he was not injured. Hart defeated Lawler by submission but refused to release the Sharpshooter. As a result, the referee reversed the decision and awarded the title of \"Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation\" to Lawler.\n\nSimultaneously, in a form of cross-promotion, Lawler engaged in a bitter feud with Vince McMahon (who at the time was never acknowledged as the actual owner of the World Wrestling Federation) back in the USWA. There, Lawler played the babyface to his hometown Memphis audience, whereas McMahon (who had always played face in the WWF) was being portrayed as a smug heel intent on dethroning Lawler as the king of professional wrestling. As part of the cross-promotion, McMahon, Bret and Owen Hart, Giant González, Tatanka, and \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage would begin appearing on USWA television to further the feud. While the program continued in the USWA, the feud between Lawler and McMahon would not be acknowledged on WWF television.\n\nThe Hart family (Bret, Owen, Bruce, and Keith) was scheduled to face a team captained by Lawler in an elimination match at Survivor Series. However, Shawn Michaels had to take Lawler's place because Lawler was facing legal troubles. As a result, the feud between Lawler and Vince McMahon back in the USWA was also abruptly discontinued. Lawler did not face Bret Hart at another pay-per-view until the first In Your House, when he beat Hart after Hakushi and his manager Shinja interfered. This set up a \"Kiss My Foot\" match at King of the Ring 1995, which Bret won. As a result, Lawler was forced to kiss Bret's feet. The feud took one final turn when Lawler introduced his \"dentist\" Isaac Yankem, D.D.S.. After Hart defeated Yankem by disqualification, however, the feud quickly disappeared.\n\nFollowing the end of his legal troubles which kept him out of Survivor Series 1993, Lawler eventually returned to the WWF at WrestleMania X, which was also his first appearance as a commentator on a WWF pay-per-view. During the main event of the night, \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper served as special guest referee for the second WWF World Heavyweight Championship match. During this Lawler began making disparaging remarks about him. Lawler would continue to berate Piper on later episodes of \"Monday Night Raw\", including bringing a skinny kid into the ring dressed as Piper and forcing him to kiss his feet. This ultimately led to a match between the two at King of the Ring 1994 which Lawler lost.\n\nIn the fall of 1994, Lawler initiated a feud with Doink the Clown. Lawler popped the balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick, Dink. After Doink and Dink retaliated, Lawler introduced a midget sidekick of his own, who he named Queasy. In the following weeks, Doink added two more sidekicks, Wink and Pink, while Lawler introduced Sleazy and Cheesy. This led to an elimination match at Survivor Series 1994, which Lawler's team won. After the match, however, Lawler's team turned on him, joining with Doink's team to attack Lawler.\nIn late 1994 and early 1995, Lawler wrestled briefly in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) while still continuing to commentate sporadically for the WWF. During his absences, Shawn Michaels filled in for him as color commentator on \"Monday Night Raw\". He defeated Tony Anthony for the promotion's top title in January 1995. By 1996, Lawler wrestled occasionally on \"WWF Superstars\" where he would take on jobbers while holding a microphone in the ring to, essentially, \"do the commentary on (his) very own matches\" while occasionally serving as the official cornerman for Isaac Yankem D.D.S. After a brief feud with The Ultimate Warrior, Lawler began feuding with Jake Roberts after making fun of Roberts' drug and alcohol problems. The two met in a match at SummerSlam 1996, which Lawler won. After the match, Lawler poured Jim Beam whiskey down Roberts' throat.\n\nIn 1997, Lawler became heavily involved in the working relationship between the WWF and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). In interviews and commentary, he referred to the promotion as \"Extremely Crappy Wrestling\". His frequent insults toward ECW eventually led to the promotion \"invading\" \"Monday Night Raw\" in February 1997 and ultimately to a match with ECW wrestler Tommy Dreamer at ECW's Hardcore Heaven pay-per-view in August, which Dreamer won.\n\nIn mid-1997, Lawler entered the King of the Ring tournament for the first time and advanced to the semi-final round where he was defeated by Mankind. By the fall, the WWF introduced a new \"light-heavyweight division\" to compete with World Championship Wrestling's cruiserweight division. Lawler's son, Brian Christopher, was one of the major superstars in the division, although the WWF played up an angle where both Lawler and Christopher would deny their family relationship, even though the two would aide each other in matches and so on.\n\nBy 1998, Lawler rarely wrestled in the WWF and focused on commentary. Despite their feud in the USWA in 1993, by 1998, Vince McMahon had turned heel in the WWF for the first time and left the announce position, to which Lawler began praising McMahon's name on commentary as part of his own heel persona, much to the chagrin of Jim Ross. It was McMahon's departure from the commentary team which led to the strong on-screen chemistry between Lawler and Ross in subsequent years. This played a key role in a change of Lawler's character; although he still supported the heels, he showed a sense of right and wrong, and would condemn actions of heels when they went too far. He would become a full-time face by 2000. This began when Lawler surprisingly attacked Tazz when he started bullying Ross. At SummerSlam, The King wrestled Tazz in defense of Ross. With the creation of the XFL in 2001, Lawler was given the job as an announcer for the new football league. Lawler claims that he never wanted to announce for the XFL (he would admit on-air that he knew and cared almost nothing about the sport), but that he agreed to it after McMahon and Kevin Dunn asked him.\n\nIn February 2001, Lawler's then-wife Stacy \"The Kat\" Carter was released by the WWF, and Lawler quit the company in protest.\n\nLawler has stated several theories as to why he was allowed to leave. His first involves the ascent of Carter's career alongside the downfall of Chyna's. In his contention, Chyna was jealous of his wife's push inside the company, in part due to the Right to Censor storyline, and in part because of his wife's offer to pose for \"Playboy\" magazine. Until that time, Chyna had been the second major wrestling star from the World Wrestling Federation to have done a piece in \"Playboy\" (after Sable); during Chyna's debut on the adult magazine, she had suddenly broken her friendship with Carter.\n\nIn interviews, he has also stated that there may have been an alternate reason, namely, that the company wanted to fire him. He also criticized McMahon for the cavalier attitude he had given him on the day he quit. In his recollection, Ross was fired by McMahon with exactly the same demeanor while struck with a bout of Bell's palsy in 1994, a time when Ross' \"usefulness\" had run out. Lawler felt that Carter's release was an attempt to remove him as well, stating that the company was well-aware that he would walk out alongside his wife. Lawler's replacement with Paul Heyman launched a theory in which Heyman was promoted at Lawler's expense. Internet rumors circulated that the company was on better terms with Heyman than Lawler, and used remarks Lawler had made in criticism of ECW to launch a theory whereby Heyman wanted Lawler out. Lawler has stated repeatedly that he has no resentment towards Heyman, accusing the media and internet theorists of spreading false information.\n\nDuring his absence from the WWF, Lawler made appearances on the independent circuit in both Australia and North America, as well as joining the fledgling Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF) promotion alongside WCW veteran Tony Schiavone as a color commentator. He also made appearances with the International Wrestling Cartel and with Maryland Championship Wrestling, where he held the promotion's world title after defeating The Bruiser on November 2.\n\nOn November 19, 2001, Lawler returned to the WWF. He was reintroduced by Vince McMahon on \"Raw\" as the replacement for color commentator (and Alliance member) Paul Heyman, who had been (kayfabe) fired in the aftermath of the Alliance's loss at the previous night's \"Survivor Series\". As he had been before his departure, Lawler once again became color commentator on \"Raw\" and pay-per-view events alongside Jim Ross and \"SmackDown!\" with Michael Cole, until the brands were separated and Lawler became exclusive to Raw. Lawler stated that his well-worked chemistry with Jim Ross has been a result of their different styles; according to Lawler, Jim Ross is a fine storyteller and keeps fans well-versed with current storylines, whereas he provides reaction and emotion to liven the commentary.\n\nIn 2003, \"Raw's\" announce team of Lawler and Jim Ross feuded with \"Sunday Night Heat\"'s team of Jonathan Coachman and Al Snow. At Unforgiven, Lawler and Ross lost a match against Coachman and Snow, thus losing their right to do commentary on \"Raw\". In a rematch, however, Ross defeated Coachman, winning Lawler and Ross their position back.\n\nIn June 2006, Extreme Championship Wrestling was re-launched and began a small invasion within WWE again. ECW and WWE went head to head for several weeks on \"Raw\", which spanned to include the SmackDown! superstars. This created tension between the Raw and SmackDown! announce teams, as Tazz, an ECW alumnus, insulted and criticized Jim Ross until Lawler came to Ross' defense, reigniting their feud from 2000. The feud concluded when Tazz and Lawler faced each other in a match at One Night Stand, which Tazz won in only 30 seconds by making Lawler pass out to the Tazzmission after a distraction from Joey Styles, who Lawler had slapped just prior to the match.\n\nIn July 2006, Randy Orton began a feud with Hulk Hogan. Lawler attacked Orton in defense of Hogan, which set up a match between them on \"Raw\". Orton defeated Lawler after a low blow and an RKO.\n\nOn March 31, 2007, Lawler was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by William Shatner, whom Lawler had a memorable altercation with on a January 1995 episode of \"Raw\". In August, King Booker claimed to be the only one entitled to be known as \"King\". After being beaten by Booker in the ring, Lawler was supposed to be forced to crown his opponent at a show of August 13 in Madison Square Garden. During the ceremony, however, Lawler announced another king as a new opponent for Booker, \"The King of Kings\" Triple H. This led to a worked brawl between Lawler and Booker.\n\nOn the July 7, 2008, episode of \"Raw\", Lawler was attacked by Kane after saving Michael Cole from a similar attack, in which Kane repeatedly asked \"Is he alive or is he dead?\" Later that summer, he teamed with \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan to face Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes for the World Tag Team Championship but lost.\n\nOn the March 23, 2009, episode of \"Raw\", Lawler challenged Chris Jericho to a match because of his disrespect and erratic behavior to WWE Hall of Famers, which Jericho accepted. The following week, Lawler lost to Jericho after submitting to the Walls of Jericho. After the match, Jericho outlined how he would remain supreme against WWE Hall of Famers at WrestleMania XXV.\n\nOn the July 20 episode of \"Raw\", Lawler announced himself as the opponent against The Brian Kendrick. He went on to defeat Kendrick. On the November 16 episode of \"Raw\", after recent acquisition, Sheamus attacked the timekeeper in frustration for not receiving an opponent, Lawler left the announce table to confront Sheamus and check on the victim, only to receive a kick to the head for his troubles. On June 7, 2010, during a Viewer's Choice edition of \"Raw\", Lawler lost his crown to IRS because he had apparently not paid his taxes, but it was regained by Quinton Jackson later on. At the end of the night, Lawler was one of the many employees at ringside that were brutally attacked by the season 1 NXT rookies. Lawler however, was the only person at ringside that fought back, as he used punches and chops to attack the NXT rookies assaulting him until it was a 3-on-1 assault. The following week on Raw, Lawler and the Raw roster fought off the now-called \"The Nexus\" when they attempted to ambush John Cena a second time. On June 28, Lawler, Ricky Steamboat, Michael Hayes, Arn Anderson, Mike Rotunda, and Dean Malenko were severely attacked by the Nexus, just as they were celebrating Steamboat's career. Josh Mathews replaced Lawler on color commentator for the remainder of the show.\n\nOn the July 26, 2010 episode of \"Raw\", Lawler teamed with Mark Henry, Goldust, Yoshi Tatsu, Evan Bourne and The Hart Dynasty in a tag team elimination match versus the Nexus. Lawler was eliminated by Heath Slater.\n\nOn the November 29, 2010 King of the Ring \"Raw\" special, Lawler, (who was celebrating his 61st birthday) challenged The Miz to a WWE Championship match. It was granted by the Anonymous Raw General Manager, who made it a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, and it was Lawler's first shot at the title. Miz retained the championship after interference by Alex Riley and Michael Cole. Cole's interference caused tension between the two, but when Lawler threatened to attack Cole, the Anonymous Raw General Manager issued a \"cease and desist\" order, which barred any physicality between them.\nLawler continued to challenge with The Miz, where on the December 20 \"Raw\", Lawler teamed with Randy Orton and John Morrison to take on Miz, Riley and Sheamus in a 6-man tag match which Lawler won by pinning Miz. This led to a rematch between Miz and Lawler the following week, with Lawler once again getting the victory, this time by count-out after Morrison got involved. Lawler teamed with Orton again on the January 10, 2011 \"Raw\", facing The Miz and Riley, which Lawler won by pinning Riley. Lawler won a 7-man Raw Rumble match on the January 31 \"Raw\" with help from John Cena to earn a WWE Championship match against The Miz at WWE Elimination Chamber, where he was unsuccessful in winning the title, ending the feud.\n\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Lawler, after having enough of Cole's attitude, which included the mocking of Lawler's mother's recent death, challenged him to a match at WrestleMania XXVII, which Cole accepted on the February 28 \"Raw\" and announced that he would be trained in the coming weeks by Jack Swagger for the upcoming match. Stone Cold Steve Austin was announced as the guest referee for the match the following week. On the March 14 \"Raw\", Lawler was confronted by his son, Brian Lawler, who was invited to Raw by Michael Cole to \"expose\" his father's character. Brian ranted about various problems he had with his father before slapping him and leaving. Cole continued to harass Lawler after Brian left, but was interrupted by a returning Jim Ross. Before JR could attack Cole, Swagger attacked Lawler from behind, and then proceeded to attack and lock in the ankle lock on JR, while Cole harassed him. Lawler tried to stop the attack, but fell victim to the ankle lock as well.\n\nAt WrestleMania, Lawler initially won the Wrestlemania match by submission but the Anonymous Raw General Manager reversed the decision due to Stone Cold physically getting involved in the match by pushing Cole, making Cole the winner by disqualification. Lawler and Jim Ross then faced Cole and Swagger at Extreme Rules in a Country Whipping match, where they were defeated. Lawler challenged Cole to one last match at Over the Limit, even going as far as to putting his Hall of Fame ring on the line and offered to personally induct Cole into the Hall of Fame itself. During the contract signing, Cole announced it would be a \"Kiss My Foot\" match. At the pay-per-view, Lawler defeated Cole. Afterwards, Jim Ross, Eve Torres and Bret Hart helped Lawler by making Cole kiss his foot. Following the pay-per-view, Cole apologized to Lawler, ending the feud.\nLawler competed in the 2012 Royal Rumble match as the number 12 entrant, but was eliminated by Cody Rhodes after 43 seconds. He, along with Booker T, eliminated Michael Cole afterwards. On the April 30, 2012 episode of \"Raw\", Lawler competed in a \"Beat the Clock\" challenge to determine the number one contender for the WWE Championship match at Over the Limit, but was defeated by Daniel Bryan, who went on to challenge for the title. On the July 9 episode of \"Raw\", Lawler went against Michael Cole in a WrestleMania XXVII rematch, which he quickly won, but the anonymous \"Raw\" General Manager, who returned that night as the guest general manager, reversed the decision and Lawler lost to Cole by disqualification following interference by Booker T. Santino Marella came out to reveal that Hornswoggle was the Anonymous \"Raw\" General Manager, who was hiding underneath the ring.\n\nOn the July 23 episode of \"WWE Raw 1000\", after CM Punk attacked The Rock, Lawler would mention on commentary that \"CM Punk has turned his back on the WWE Universe\". The following week on \"Raw\", Punk would confront Lawler about what he said before being interrupted by Big Show. On the August 20 episode of \"Raw\", after John Cena wouldn't tell Punk he was the \"Best in the World\", Punk would ask for Lawler to get in the ring and say it for the WWE Universe. After Lawler refused to say Punk was the \"Best in the World\" too, Punk would attack Lawler from behind. The next week on \"Raw\", after Lawler demanded an apology from Punk, Punk would challenge Lawler to a match, which Lawler would accept later that night, where Punk would defeat Lawler in a Steel Cage match. Before the September 3 episode of \"Raw\", Punk and Lawler brawled backstage, with Punk getting the upper hand before officials stopped them, Lawler was kicked in the throat, which caused Lawler to miss commentary that night, with The Miz filling in for him.\n\nOn September 10, 2012 during \"Raw\" at the Bell Centre in Montreal, not long after defeating CM Punk and Dolph Ziggler in a tag-team match with Randy Orton, Lawler legitimately collapsed at the announcers table while Kane and Daniel Bryan competed against The Prime Time Players. Fellow commentator Michael Cole continued to call that match alone, as well as the next match, before WWE (through Cole) announced the medical situation with Lawler. The remaining matches on the show went ahead as scheduled but without commentary, and updates on Jerry's condition were provided by Cole. At the end of the broadcast, it was announced that he had received CPR, but was breathing independently and reacting to stimulation. It was later confirmed on WWE.com that Lawler had suffered a heart attack. On September 11, 2012, he underwent an angioplasty to improve blood flow to his heart. On September 12, 2012, Lawler was reported to be slowly being eased off sedation, his ventilator removed. He was able to blink, nod, and squeeze with his hands, and that same day, the results of several CT scans showed no signs of brain damage. By September 17, Lawler had returned to his home in Memphis. During Lawler's hospital stay, it was determined that his heart attack was not caused by a blocked artery, but was instead an unexplained cardiac arrest. Lawler was soon medically cleared to continue wrestling.\nIt was announced on October 29, 2012, that Lawler would return to WWE on the November 12 episode of \"Raw\". He continued his rivalry with CM Punk after his emotional return was interrupted by CM Punk and Paul Heyman, who re-enacted his heart attack. Lawler continued to favor Punk's opponents, hoping that Punk would lose the WWE Championship, which he eventually did to The Rock at the Royal Rumble much to Lawler's delight.\n\nOn the March 17, 2014 episode of \"Raw\", Lawler was blamed by Kane for allowing fans to enter the ring the previous week in Memphis as part of Daniel Bryan's \"Occupy RAW Movement\". He was forced in the ring by The Shield but The Shield instead attacked Kane.\n\nOn January 8, 2015, it was announced on WWE.com that Lawler would be a part of the \"SmackDown\" broadcast team as a color commentator along with Michael Cole and Byron Saxton starting January 15, ending his 19-year run as a color commentator of \"Raw\" as he was replaced by Booker T.\n\nOn the March 30 episode of \"Raw\", Lawler made a one night return to commentary for \"Raw\" with Saxton to fill in for Michael Cole, Booker T and JBL after they were assaulted by Brock Lesnar after Lesnar was refused his rematch against Seth Rollins. On June 17, 2016, Lawler was suspended following his arrest for domestic assault, with WWE stating they have \"zero tolerance for matters involving domestic violence, and per our policy, Jerry Lawler was suspended indefinitely following his arrest\", until July 1, when the charges were dropped and WWE lifted Lawler's suspension.\n\nOn July 7, 2016, Lawler returned to \"SmackDown\" resuming his commentary role. However, shortly afterwards, Lawler was taken off TV and placed on the pre-show of both \"Raw\" and \"Smackdown\" as an analyst.\n\nOn December 5, 2016, it was announced that Lawler will no longer be used on pre-shows and instead be kept for special events such as the Hall of Fame ceremony.\n\nOn January 17, 2017, Lawler returned to \"SmackDown Live\" to host the return of The King's Court from his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. During his interview with Dolph Ziggler, Ziggler took credit for Lawler's real life heart attack in 2012 before and kicking him in the chest and leaving the ring. Later that night on \"Talking Smack\", Renee Young announced that Lawler, Michael Cole and Corey Graves will be the commentary team for the Royal Rumble match at the 2017 Royal Rumble. On August 28, 2017, Jerry filled in for Booker T on Raw commentary from his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. Lawler, Jim Ross and numerous other WWE Legends appeared on Raw 25 on January 22. On January 26, 2018 it was revealed that Lawler signed a new one year deal with WWE. At the 2018 Royal Rumble, during the men's match, Lawler was the special guest commentator where he predicted that Shinsuke Nakamura would win the match.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, Lawler suffered a stroke at his home in Memphis. He explained the incident on his podcast, which he revealed he couldn't speak for three days. He stayed in the hospital's ICU until he woke up three days later and regained his speech. The doctors said Lawler would make a full recovery. He was able to make all of his appearances during WrestleMania 34 weekend in New Orleans and was cleared to wrestle.\n\nLatest update on 02 December, Jerry \"The King\" Lawler will make a charity wrestling appearance against Triple H and The Big Show in a 3-way no Disqualification Hardcore match in Detroit on 3rd March 2019 for the \"Feed The Children\" foundation. This is very likely his last and final westling match due to his failing health condition.\n\nIn 2007 it was announced that Lawler would be participating in a 'dream match' with Hulk Hogan which had been set to take place in the Memphis Wrestling promotion on April 27. The match had been heavily-hyped by promoter Corey Maclin as Hogan had competed in the Memphis territory early in his career. On April 12, however, Lawler pulled out of the event citing his contractual obligations to WWE rendering him unable to appear on a show that was due to be filmed by VH1 for the television show \"Hogan Knows Best\". On January 11, 2008, Maclin revealed that he filed a lawsuit against WWE, claiming that pressure on Lawler (and others) to withdraw from the event violated section two of the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\nIn May 2010, Lawler announced a new TV wrestling show called, \"Jerry Lawler's Memphis Wrestling\". The show was set to debut on Ion Network channel 50 in Memphis on June 5 at the classic 11 am timespot. Three episodes were taped May 20, 2010 at the Vine in Memphis. On September 11, 2010, Lawler announced that there would no longer be any new shows, but that the talent was still available for fundraisers.\n\nOn October 24, 2015, Lawler defeated Terry Funk by disqualification at \"USA Championship Wrestling\" in Jackson, Tennessee at the Oman Arena in what was Funk's latest retirement match.\nHowever, it was confirmed in 2017 that Jerry will team with Doug Gilbert and his son Brian Christopher to face The Rock 'n' Roll Express and Terry Funk in Terry's next \"retirement match\" for Big Time Wrestling on September 22, 2017.\n\nLawler has created some musical recordings. Among these are two late-1970s singles: \"Cadillac Man/Memphis\", and \"Bad News\". During his feud with manager Jimmy Hart (Lawler is a factor for \"The Mouth of the South\" Jimmy Hart entering professional wrestling; Lawler wanted to record a wrestling album with him singing, and since they had gone to school together, he called Hart and asked him to be a part of it) in the mid-1980s, Hart became known as \"The Wimp\", a nickname given to him by Lawler and chanted by fans. Hart was the subject of the song \"Wimpbusters\", which was sung by Lawler to the tune of the popular hit \"Ghostbusters\" by Ray Parker, Jr.. A music video was also made, featuring Lawler, legendary announcer Lance Russell, and wrestlers such as Randy Savage, Jimmy Valiant, Dutch Mantel, Tommy Rich, and Rufus R. Jones, along with footage of \"The King\" beating Hart and his \"First Family.\" A very young Brian Christopher also made an appearance as a young child being bullied, and another child is seen wearing a replica of Tully Blanchard's West Texas State jersey. He also recorded a CD titled \"Memphis' Other King\".\n\nIn 1998, Lawler appeared in the movie \"Man on the Moon\", starring Jim Carrey. According to Lawler's autobiography, \"It's Good To Be The King... Sometimes\", an incident involving Jim Carrey forgetting a line led to animosity between the two actors during filming. Between scenes Jim Carrey often remained in character as Andy Kaufman and at one point spit on Jerry, just as Kaufman had done in 1982. A 'stunned' Lawler reacted by grabbing Carrey by the hair and locked him in a sleeper hold and jerking his neck—supposedly sending Carrey to the hospital.\n\nIn 1999, Lawler ran for mayor of Memphis, Tennessee. His platform focused on making the streets safer for residents, beautifying the city, and improving the quality of education. In addition, he vowed to attract businesses to Memphis, improve the flow of traffic, create more parks, and decrease property taxes. Lawler ended up with 11.7% of ballots, beating twelve of the fifteen candidates. Ultimately, however, Mayor Willie Herenton was easily reelected.\n\nIn 2000, Lawler made a very brief cameo appearance in the music video of \"I Can't Lie To Me\" By Clay Davidson. On December 17, 2002; he released his autobiography titled \"It's Good To Be The King... Sometimes\". On July 8, 2009, Lawler again ran for the position of Mayor of Memphis in a special mayoral election; on October 15, 2009. He was in 5th with 4% of the vote.\n\nLawler is also an accomplished commercial artist, designing graphics for various companies, including WWE. In 2007, he painted the cover of the wrestling comic book \"Headlocked\".\n\nIn 2012, he played the role of Sheriff Jackson Cole in the horror comedy film \"Girls Gone Dead\".\n\nLawler has provided his voice for numerous WWE video games in which he has appeared as a commentator. He is also a playable character in a number of WWE games, most recently \"WWE All Stars\" as a wrestler, \"WWE '12\" as both a wrestler and a commentator and \"WWE '13\", \"WWE 2K14\", \"WWE 2K15\", and \"WWE 2K16\" and \"WWE 2K17\" simply as a commentator.\n\nIn 2016, Lawler opened his wrestling-themed establishment \"King Jerry Lawler's Hall of Fame Bar & Grille\" in Beale Street, Downtown Memphis, Tennessee. The next year Lawler opened \"King Jerry Lawler's Memphis BBQ Co.\" in Cordova, Tennessee.\n\nIn March 2017, Lawler launched his own wrestling and pop culture podcast called \"Dinner With The King\", which will have new episodes every Wednesday. His co-host is Glenn Moore and the podcast is produced by Pod Avenue. Where he said he will be buried next to Issac Hayes and have pictures of him all over his headstone.\n\nLawler is the cousin of fellow professional wrestler The Honky Tonk Man. Lawler has been married three times and had two sons with his first wife, Kay. His son Brian, who wrestled in WWF/E under the names \"Brian Christopher\" and \"Grandmaster Sexay,\" committed suicide on July 29, 2018. His other son, Kevin, has been in professional wrestling as both a referee and wrestler under the names \"Kevin Christian\" and \"Freddie Gilbert,\" the latter of which was used during a stint as the \"brother\" of Eddie Gilbert. In his book \"It's Good To Be The King ... Sometimes,\" Lawler says he believes Kevin's short physical stature has prevented him from reaching success similar to Brian. In August 2008, Kevin was arrested on charges of trespassing and aggravated burglary. After divorcing Kay, Lawler was later married to Paula from February 14, 1982 to October 2, 1991.\n\nHe met his third wife, Stacy \"The Kat\" Carter, at a charity softball game in Memphis, Tennessee on July 23, 1989. They married in September 2000. In mid-February 2001, Carter (who was a valet and has also made in-ring appearances) was released by the World Wrestling Federation. Lawler then left the company in protest. Carter and Lawler later separated shortly before Lawler rejoined the WWF in November 2001. Their divorce was finalized on October 15, 2003.\n\nIn 1993, Lawler was indicted on charges of allegedly raping a 15-year-old girl, which caused him to miss Survivor Series 1993. The charges were later dropped, after the girl admitted she fabricated some of the story. Lawler was arrested on March 16, 1999 after throwing a ticket at a police officer and running over the officer's foot. In 2016, Lawler and his girlfriend, Lauryn McBride, were both arrested on charges of domestic abuse, with each party claiming the other assaulted them. Lawler was suspended indefinitely for the incident. On July 1, 2016, WWE.com reported that his suspension had been lifted and all charges were dropped against both him and his girlfriend.\n\nThough he has spent most of his life in Memphis, Lawler did spend a part of his childhood in Ohio after his father was transferred to a Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Lorain, Ohio. From the ages of 7 to 15 his family resided in the city of Amherst, Ohio, a suburb near Cleveland. Though this stay was brief, it would have an influence on Lawler throughout his life thereafter. He often cites Cleveland as his second-favorite city behind only Memphis and is a die-hard fan of the Cleveland Indians, the Cleveland Browns, and the Cleveland Cavaliers. When WWE performs in Cleveland, Lawler will usually wear a Browns jersey or an Indians jersey (at SummerSlam 1996 he teased Browns fans by wearing a Baltimore Ravens jersey, because the original Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens), and during baseball season, he will throw out the first pitch at an Indians game.\n\nLawler is a collector of Coca-Cola and Superman merchandise, and owns a replica of the Batmobile from the 1960s Batman series.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2760611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2760611", "title": "John Tucker Daland House", "text": "John Tucker Daland House\n\nThe John Tucker Daland House (1851–1852) is an imposing, Italianate house designed by architect Gridley James Fox Bryant and is located at 132 Essex Street, Salem, Massachusetts, United States in the Essex Institute Historic District and now owned by the Peabody Essex Museum as home for the Essex Institute. \n\nThe three-story brick house was originally built for John Tucker Daland, a prosperous merchant. The Dalands lived in the house until 1885, when it was acquired by the Essex Institute. It was then remodeled as offices by architect William Devereux Dennis (1847–1913) and in 1907 connected to the adjacent Plummer Hall (former home to the Salem Athenaeum).\n\nThe house was among the last detached brick houses to be built in Salem. Features of interest include rusticated corner quoins and foundation, fine cornices, both arched and flat-entablatured windows, and an imposing front porch supported by Corinthian columns and topped with a Palladian window. At one time the house also featured roof and porch balustrades, as well as panelled brick chimneys.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19822915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19822915", "title": "Julia Frankau", "text": "Julia Frankau\n\nJulia Frankau, née Julia Davis (30 July 1859 – 17 March 1916) was a successful novelist who wrote under the name Frank Danby. Her first novel was published in 1887: \"Dr. Phillips: A Maida Vale Idyll\". Its portrayal of London Jews and Jewish life, and its discussion of euthanasia by a doctor were controversial. This was followed by more Frank Danby novels and by books on other subjects, including engraving, which were sometimes written under her own name. Frankau continued to write until the time of her death.\n\nFrankau's father was Hyman Davis (1824–1875), a London portrait photographer, though she and her older siblings were born in Dublin, where Davis practised as a dentist during the 1850s. On returning to London in the early 1860s, the Davis family lived first in Bruton Street before moving to Maida Vale.\n\nShe was a sister of the librettist Owen Hall (1853–1907) and the gossip columnist and fashion writer Mrs Aria (1861–1931). For a brief period during her early teens, she was home-tutored by Laura Lafargue, a daughter of Karl Marx. Another of her brothers, Harrie Davis, emigrated to New York, where he was employed as manager of the Gettysburg Cyclorama and also went on to pursue a journalistic career.\n\nShe married the London cigar importer Arthur Frankau (1849–1904) in 1883. They lived first at 103 Gloucester Terrace (London W), moving to 32a Weymouth Street in the later 1880s. Two of their three sons were author Gilbert Frankau (1884–1952) and actor Ronald Frankau (1894–1951) (thus Julia Frankau is grandmother of novelist Pamela Frankau and actress Rosemary Frankau, and great-grandmother of bibliographer Timothy d'Arch Smith and scriptwriter Sam Bain), and their daughter was the Cambridge don Joan Bennett (1896–1986), one of the \"constellation of critics\" called by the defence in the Lady Chatterley Trial. In this connection, Julia herself was credited by Mrs Belloc Lowndes with having been \"one of the very few to recognise the genius of D. H. Lawrence\".\n\nJulia's sister Florette married architect Marcus E. Collins in 1889, thus connecting the Davis and Frankau families with Arthur Collins of Drury Lane Theatre, theatrical manager Horace Collins, and stage director Frank Collins. Florette Collins published one novel in 1906, whereupon her sisters suggested she should content herself with being \"the beauty of the family\". The actor Henry Irving joined Arthur and Julia Frankau's family circle after Mrs Aria became his mistress in the 1890s.\n\nDuring the 1890s, Julia Frankau began to research and write on engraving, ultimately publishing (under her own married name) three books on the subject. Her sister Eliza recalled: \"having started a small collection of eighteenth-century engravings of mezzotint and stipple, she particularly favoured the English stipple colour prints, and because no book existed telling her what she wanted to know about them, she set to work and wrote one.\" After she returned to fiction – or, to use her own phrase, \"relapsed into novel writing\" – in 1902, \"The Sketch\" found \"something quaint in the thought that Mrs Frankau – who, as 'Frank Danby', has recently published that brilliant study of contemporary manners (and morals), \"Pigs in Clover\" – should be, as she is without question, the greatest living authority on that daintiest product of the eighteenth century, the colour-print.\"\n\nThe commercial success of \"Pigs in Clover\", which coincided with a substantial inheritance from Arthur's late brother and business partner Edwin Frankau (1854–1903), permitted Arthur and Julia Frankau to move from Weymouth Street to 11 Clarges Street, as well as acquiring a seaside retreat named Clover Cottage (now 13 South Cliff, Eastbourne). Their Clarges Street house was said to have been occupied at one time by Emma, Lady Hamilton, thus providing inspiration for Frank Danby's \"Story of Emma, Lady Hamilton\".\n\nThe first Frank Danby novel, originally published by Vizetelly in 1887, was a somewhat controversial social satire set in the affluent Jewish Maida Vale world where the author herself – \"a Jewish girl from an Anglo-Jewish family of impeccable orthodoxy\" – had grown up. \"Punch\" was said to have commented: \"It should never have been written. Having been written, it should never have been published. Having been published, it should not be read.\"\n\n\"Dr Phillips\" earned notoriety on two counts. \"The Jews in Frankau's novel are repugnant. They are almost without exception uneducated, narrow, clannish, vulgar, materialistic, and tasteless.\" \"Imagine the shock,\" recalled Horace Collins, \"when it was discovered that the book contained characters with obvious likenesses to members of the family and cronies of my mother. Their idiosyncrasies and weaknesses had been held up to ridicule with mordant wit and subtle irony. ... \"Dr Phillips\" was, in fact, in advance of the times and might be deemed to have been the precursor of the smart Society type of novel.\"\n\nThe second controversial aspect was the conduct of the eponymous doctor, who deliberately administers a lethal morphia overdose to his (German-Jewish) wife in the hope of being able to marry his (Gentile) mistress, the mother of his illegitimate daughter. It was bruited at the time of publication that the fictional Jewish Dr Phillips (named Dr Abrams in a pre-publication draft) was based on the real-life (Jewish) surgeon Ernest Abraham Hart, then editor of the \"British Medical Journal\", whose first wife had died by \"accidental poisoning\" in 1861. Mrs Aria insisted that \"Dr Phillips\" had \"fluttered the dovecotes of Maida Vale, rattled the skeletons in the cupboards and the stout ladies at the card-tables, but never merited the popular suspicion that the hero was taken from life.\" On the other hand, Mrs Belloc Lowndes suggested that the characters in \"Dr Phillips\" had been more closely based on real-life individuals than those of any other Frank Danby novel, recalling particularly that the character of Dr Phillips \"was supposed to have been drawn from a well-known doctor, and he must have felt the cap fitted his head, for he bought up and destroyed every copy he was able to procure.\"\n\n\"The scandal of \"Dr Phillips\" was compounded by publication the following year of Amy Levy's \"Reuben Sachs\" (1888). Levy was almost as harsh in her delineation of Jewish manners and morals, and the two works became linked in public discussion, the notoriety of each reinforcing that of the other.\"\n\nMrs Aria commented that \"The Sphinx's Lawyer\" was \"written to defend the undefendable Oscar Wilde\" – she and Frank Danby having both, through their brother Owen Hall, met Wilde in their youth. It is probably not accidental that \"Sphinx\" was Wilde's name for their mutual friend and fellow-writer Ada Leverson. \"The Sphinx's Lawyer\" was dedicated to Owen Hall who, according to its author, vehemently disapproved both the story and its subject matter. The printed dedication, addressed directly to her brother, fills a page and a half, insisting: \"your harsh criticism has intensified my conviction of the righteousness of the cause I plead ... I have heard all your argument; I know where I stand. It is at the foot of the Throne of Mercy, with my client by my side, the client of the Sphinx's Lawyer. You, as well as I, know what he was in his brilliant youth, you, as well as I, know how weak he was in his strength, of what flawed physique and untoward inheritance. \"Pity\" was the one unsounded note in the chorus of execration that followed this poor leper to his grave, and beyond it; to awaken pity I have written.\"\n\n\"The Heart of a Child\" (1908), a less controversial tale based on a storyline devised by Owen Hall, enjoyed great commercial success as a novel, was twice filmed as a motion picture, and rewritten in 1920 by Gilbert Frankau as a stage play – in which form it did not succeed, though Frankau noted that the novel itself was still earning royalties in the Summer of 1939. The heroine Sally Snape was played by Edna Flugrath in the first film version, Alla Nazimova in the second, and Renée Kelly in Gilbert Frankau's theatrical adaptation. Her most popular novel was \"Joseph in Jeopardy\" (1912).\n\n\"Twilight\" was a novel completed by Frank Danby on her deathbed, about a female author on her deathbed who is inspired to write about the death of a female author. The character of the ailing Jane Vevaseur is a semi-autobiographical portrayal of Julia Frankau, while her loving sister Eliza Aria is represented by the character of Ella Lovegrove. The title itself is a doubly resonant play on words – the dictum \"Work whilst ye have the light\" is quoted several times by the narrator, alluding to the fact that she (like Frank Danby) is running out of time; and it transpires that Dr Kennedy, Jane Vevaseur's medical attendant, brought about the death of writer Margaret Capel some years previously by deliberately administering a lethal overdose of what the narrator refers to as \"hyoscine\", a drug known in its day as \"Twilight Sleep\". Unlike the undetected murder in \"Dr Phillips\", however, this one is conducted with great reluctance at the patient's own poignant request.\n\n\n"}

He is also known for being one-half of the first-ever World Tag Team Champions with Yoshiaki Yatsu, having won the NWA International Tag Team Championship and the PWF Tag Team Championship, and unifying the two titles.\n\nTsuruta participated in many sports, such as swimming, basketball, and sumo while attending Hikawa Senior High School in Yamanashi-shi, Yamanashi Prefecture.\n\nWhile at Chuo University, he began an amateur wrestling career. He won the All Japan Amateur Wrestling Championship in freestyle and Greco-Roman as a superheavyweight (at the time, an unlimited class for those weighing over 100 kilograms) in the years 1971 and 1972.\n\nHe also competed in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. He finished the Greco-Roman tournament with no wins.\n\nScouted by AJPW promoter Giant Baba, he was sent to the local Amarillo, Texas promotion in the U.S. to train as a pro under Dory Funk Jr. While wrestling in the United States, Tsuruta was the first Japanese wrestler to be cheered by an American crowd, due to his hard work ethic and wrestling ability. The name \"Jumbo\" was given to him by a fan contest in Japan to replace his given name, which was seen as too feminine. He defeated Nick Bockwinkel on February 22, 1984 to win the AWA World Heavyweight Championship in Tokyo, Japan. He would lose the title to Rick Martel on May 13, 1984 in St. Paul, Minnesota. Tsuruta and Yoshiaki Yatsu became the first World Tag Team Champions on June 10, 1988.\n\nDuring his 26-year career, he fought in 3,329 matches. Some of his most notable opponents include Stan Hansen, Billy Robinson, The Destroyer, Bruiser Brody, Genichiro Tenryu, Abdullah the Butcher, Terry Funk, Dory Funk Jr., Mitsuharu Misawa, Harley Race, Verne Gagne, Rick Martel, Riki Choshu, Jack Brisco, Ric Flair, and Nick Bockwinkel. Tsuruta was the first Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion (unifying the Pacific Wrestling Federation, NWA United National, and NWA International Heavyweight titles), defeating Stan Hansen on April 18, 1989 in Tokyo.\n\nIn 1992, he completed the October \"Giant Series\" tour before disappearing from the company for almost a year. For the rest of his career, he participated mostly in comedic (i.e. exhibition) six-man tag team matches; he frequently teamed with Baba and old rival Rusher Kimura in matches against teams which included Masanobu Fuchi, Haruka Eigen, and other old-timers. He announced his retirement on February 20, 1999 and held a ceremony on March 6, 1999.\n\nFour days after Tsuruta's retirement, he and his family moved to the United States to be a visiting researcher at the University of Portland in Oregon. Tsuruta had a bachelor's degree in political science and earned a master's degree in coaching in 1997, later becoming a part-time instructor in physical training at his old University.\n\nHis health deteriorated, however, as he had been diagnosed with kidney cancer, which eventually spread to his liver, and by the end of the year he was back in Japan. In April 2000, he left for Australia, where he had an operation to remove the cancer, while there a kidney donor was found in Manila. Tsuruta died at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute in Quezon City, Philippines on May 13, 2000, from complications of the kidney transplant.\n\nHe had three sons: Ken, Naoki, and Yuji.\n\n\n\n"}

Destroyed in World War II, it was re-created in cast metal by Albert Mazzotti Jr in 1953. The statue now stands in a small square in the Old Quarter of Münster. In 1987 American sculptor Jeff Koons created a replica of the design in polished cast stainless steel.\n\nThe original statue, like its successors, depicted a kiepenkerl (literally \"pannier guy\": a travelling merchant or pedlar [US: peddler] with a carrying basket, whistle, knot stick and linen smock. It was carved from Baumberger sandstone by August Schmiemann and was inaugurated in Münster on 16 October 1896. The statue was destroyed by a US tank in World War II.\n\nA competition for a new statue was held immediately after the war ended. However, the new designs were vetoed by the mayor of Münster, Karl Zuhorn (). Subsequently Albert Mazzotti Jr was commissioned to create a statue in bronze. It was inaugurated on 20 September 1953 by Federal President Theodor Heuss. Its location is Kiepenkerl Square, in the Old Quarter of Münster ().\n\nFor the 1987 Sculpture Projects Münster, American sculptor Jeff Koons created a replica of the statue in polished cast stainless steel. Koons produced an edition of three; one is on display at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. (). \n\nThe guide for the Sculpture Projects Münster includes these notes by Georg Jappe:\nThe Kiepenkerl monument symbolizes the man who comes to town with a few eggs, potatoes, and rabbits in his \"Kiepe\" (a huge basket carried on the back). Actually he is a \"Kötter\" (a tenant farmer). The statue, created by an academic sculptor, became especially popular when, during the war, everything was burnt down, only the statue remained standing and then was blasted by a tank crew. The will to survive during the hoarding times: as early as 1953, the city of Münster still in ruins, Theodor Heuss inaugurated a new life-size Kiepenkerl monument in bronze.\n\nBronze is art. That is the only art in this restoration monument. Jeff Koons now has recast it in stainless steel which he calls the \"material of the masses\" (a highly complicated procedure: as the form does not correspond to any industrial standard, the various parts had to be smelted at 1800 degrees Centigrade and cast one by one and then welded together) and finally gave it a high mirror polish to create a \"false front of luxury\".\n\n\n"}

Incidents of unethical experimentation, clinical trials lacking properly informed consent, and forced medical procedures have been claimed and prosecuted.\n\nThe Pfizer drug Trovan was used in a clinical trial in Kano, Nigeria. The trial compared the new antibiotic (Trovan) against the best treatment available at the time (intravenous ceftriaxone). Eleven children died in the trial: five after taking Trovan and six after taking an older antibiotic used for comparison in the clinical trial. Others suffered blindness, deafness and brain damage, the cause of which is difficult to determine because these disabilities are relatively common outcomes of the disease itself. A panel of medical experts later implicated Pfizer in the incident, concluding the drug had been administered as part of an illegal clinical trial without authorization from the Nigerian government or consent from the children's parents. This led to a lawsuit from the Nigerian government over informed consent. Pfizer countered that it met all the necessary regulations. Note: the drug was then approved for general use in the US, and then eventually withdrawn due to hepatotoxicity.\n\nAZT trials conducted on HIV-positive African subjects by U.S. physicians and the University of Zimbabwe were not performed with proper informed consent. The United States began testing AZT treatments in Africa in 1994, through projects funded by Centers for Disease Control (CDC), World health organization (WHO) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It included testing of over 17,000 women for a medication that prevents mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS. The subjects did not fully understand the testing methods, the effectiveness, the possible dangers, or the nature of a placebo in testing situations. They were also told about the trials under duress. Half of these women received a placebo that has no effect, making transmission likely. As a result, an estimated 1000 babies contracted HIV/AIDS although a proven life-saving regimen already existed. The CDC ended the short course testing in 1998 after they announced they had enough information from Thailand trials.\n\nIn a project headed by Dr. Aubrey Levin during the 1970s to 1980s, the South African Defence Force forced lesbian and gay military personnel to undergo \"sex-change\" operations. This was part of a secret program to purge homosexuality in the army. It included psychological coercion, chemical castration, electric shock, and other unethical medical experiments. An estimated 900 forced sexual reassignment operations may have been performed between 1971 and 1989 at military hospitals.Most of the victims were males, young 16 to 24-year-old white men who were drafted into the army during the South African Border War. Women were also subject to the experimentation.\n\nDepo-Provera was clinically tested on black Rhodesian (now Zimbabwean) women in the 1970s. Once approved, the drug was used as a population control measure. Women on white-run commercial farms were coerced into accepting Depo-Provera. In 1981, the drug was banned in what was by then Zimbabwe.\n\nDr. Eugen Fischer conducted sterilisation experiments on Herero women in German South-West Africa (now Namibia, less Walvis Bay etc.) in the early 1900s. His experimentation was largely done on mixed-race offspring in order to provide justification to ban mixed-race marriages. He joined the Nazi party thereafter where he did similar experiments in the Jewish concentration camps. Late stage studies were later continued by Doctor Hams Harmsen, founder of the German branch of International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) whose name is also associated with the compulsory sterilisation in Nazi Germany.\n\nUnethical medical experimentation that has occurred for over a century may be the cause of the documented fear and mistrust of doctors and medicine in Africa. For example, polio has been on the rise in Nigeria, Chad, and Burkina Faso because many people there avoid vaccinations because they believe that the vaccines are contaminated with HIV or sterilization agents. Due to the meningitis testing incident in Kano, many Nigerians now refuse to participate in clinical trials.\n\nMany African nations cannot afford to offer medicine for their citizens without subsidies from multinational pharmaceutical corporations. To court these pharmaceutical corporations, some African nations minimize legal regulations on the conduct of medical research, which prevents potential legal battles from arising. This forces some Africans to make a Hobson's choice: \"experimental medicine or no medicine at all\". People living in the rural or slum area are also more vulnerable to experimentation because they are more likely to be illiterate and to misunderstand the effects of the experimentation.\n\nSeveral national and international bodies have devised codes of ethics for conducting experiments and clinical trials. These include the Nuremberg Code and Helsinki Declaration and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, which seeks to prohibit all medical and scientific experiments on women without their prior informed consent.\n\nThe book and movie \"The Constant Gardener\" highlighted the dynamics of conduct in clinical trials in Africa in the slum areas. This was based on the real-life meningitis incident in Kano, Nigeria. New York Times best seller book \"Medical Apartheid\" by Harriet A. Washington, provides a historical account of experimentation on African Americans, but also includes the links to African experimentation.\n\n"}
{"id": "49696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49696", "title": "Metropolis (1927 film)", "text": "Metropolis (1927 film)\n\nMetropolis is a 1927 German expressionist science-fiction drama film directed by Fritz Lang. Written by Thea von Harbou in collaboration with Lang, it stars Gustav Fröhlich, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge and Brigitte Helm. Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studios for Universum Film A.G. (Ufa). The silent film is regarded as a pioneering science-fiction movie, being among the first feature-length movies of that genre. Filming took place over 17 months in 1925–26 at a cost of over five million Reichsmarks.\n\nMade in Germany during the Weimar Period, \"Metropolis\" is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city master, and Maria, a saintly figure to the workers, to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes in their city and bring the workers together with Joh Fredersen, the city master. The film's message is encompassed in the final inter-title: \"The Mediator Between the Head and the Hands Must Be the Heart\".\n\n\"Metropolis\" met a mixed reception upon release. Critics found it pictorially beautiful and visually powerful—the film's art direction by Otto Hunte, Erich Kettelhut and Kurt Vollbrecht draws influence from Bauhaus, Cubist and Futurist design, along with touches of the Gothic in the scenes in the catacombs, the cathedral and Rotwang's house—and lauded its complex special effects, but accused its story of naiveté. H. G. Wells described the film as \"silly\", and \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" calls the film's story \"trite\" and its politics \"ludicrously simplistic\". The film's alleged Communist message was also criticized.\n\nThe film's extensive running time also came in for criticism, and \"Metropolis\" was cut substantially after its German premiere, with a large portion of Lang's original footage removed. Many attempts have been made to restore the film since the 1970s. In 1984 Music producer Giorgio Moroder released a truncated version with a soundtrack by rock artists such as Freddie Mercury, Loverboy and Adam Ant. In 2001 a new reconstruction of \"Metropolis\" was shown at the Berlin Film Festival. In 2008 a damaged print of Lang's original cut of the film was found in a museum in Argentina. After a long restoration process that required additional materials provided by a print from New Zealand, the film was 95% restored and shown on large screens in Berlin and Frankfurt simultaneously on 12 February 2010.\n\nIn 2001, the film was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register, the first film thus distinguished.\n\nIn the future, in the city of Metropolis, wealthy industrialists and business magnates and their top employees reign from high-rise towers, while underground-dwelling workers toil to operate the great machines that power the city. Joh Fredersen is the city's master. His son Freder idles away his time at sports and in a pleasure garden, but is interrupted by the arrival of a young woman named Maria, who has brought a group of workers' children to witness the lifestyle of their rich \"brothers\". Maria and the children are ushered away, but Freder, fascinated, goes to the lower levels to find her. On the machine levels he witnesses the explosion of a huge machine that kills and injures numerous workers. Freder has a hallucination that the machine is Moloch and the workers are being fed to it. When the hallucination ends and he sees the dead workers being carried away on stretchers, he hurries to tell his father about the accident; Fredersen asks his assistant, Josaphat, why he learned of the explosion from his son, and not from him.\n\nGrot, foreman of the Heart Machine, brings Fredersen secret maps found on the dead workers. Fredersen again asks Josaphat why he did not learn of the maps from him, and fires him. After seeing his father's cold indifference towards the harsh conditions they face, Freder secretly rebels against him by deciding to help the workers. He enlists Josaphat's assistance and returns to the machine halls, where he trades places with a worker.\n\nFredersen takes the maps to the inventor Rotwang to learn their meaning. Rotwang had been in love with a woman named Hel, who left him to marry Fredersen and later died giving birth to Freder. Rotwang shows Fredersen a robot he has built to \"resurrect\" Hel. The maps show a network of catacombs beneath Metropolis, and the two men go to investigate. They eavesdrop on a gathering of workers, including Freder. Maria addresses them, prophesying the arrival of a mediator who can bring the working and ruling classes together. Freder believes he could fill the role and declares his love for Maria. Fredersen orders Rotwang to give Maria's likeness to the robot so that it can ruin her reputation among the workers to prevent any rebellion. Fredersen is unaware that Rotwang plans to use the robot to kill Freder and take over Metropolis. Rotwang kidnaps Maria, transfers her likeness to the robot and sends her to Fredersen. Freder finds the two embracing and, believing it is the real Maria, falls into a prolonged delirium. Intercut with his hallucinations, the false Maria unleashes chaos throughout Metropolis, driving men to murder and stirring dissent among the workers.\n\nFreder recovers and returns to the catacombs. Finding the false Maria urging the workers to rise up and destroy the machines, Freder accuses her of not being the real Maria. The workers follow the false Maria from their city to the machine rooms, leaving their children behind. They destroy the Heart Machine, which causes the workers' city below to flood. The real Maria, having escaped from Rotwang's house, rescues the children with Freder's and Josaphat's help. Grot berates the celebrating workers for abandoning their children in the flooded city. Believing their children to be dead, the hysterical workers capture the false Maria and burn her at the stake. A horrified Freder watches, not understanding the deception until the fire reveals her to be a robot. Rotwang is delusional, seeing the real Maria as his lost Hel, and chases her to the roof of the cathedral, pursued by Freder. The two men fight as Fredersen and the workers watch from the street. Rotwang falls to his death. Freder fulfills his role as mediator by linking the hands of Fredersen and Grot to bring them together.\n\n\n\n\"Metropolis\" features a range of elaborate special effects and set designs, ranging from a huge gothic cathedral to a futuristic cityscape. In an interview, Fritz Lang reported that \"the film was born from my first sight of the skyscrapers in New York in October 1924\". He had visited New York City for the first time and remarked \"I looked into the streets—the glaring lights and the tall buildings—and there I conceived \"Metropolis\",\" although in actuality Lang and Harbou had been at work on the idea for over a year. Describing his first impressions of the city, Lang said that \"the buildings seemed to be a vertical sail, scintillating and very light, a luxurious backdrop, suspended in the dark sky to dazzle, distract and hypnotize\". He added \"The sight of Neuyork [sic] alone should be enough to turn this beacon of beauty into the center of a film...\"\n\nThe appearance of the city in \"Metropolis\" is strongly informed by the Art Deco movement; however it also incorporates elements from other traditions. Ingeborg Hoesterey described the architecture featured in \"Metropolis\" as eclectic, writing how its locales represent both \"functionalist modernism [and] art deco\" whilst also featuring \"the scientist's archaic little house with its high-powered laboratory, the catacombs [and] the Gothic cathedral\". The film's use of art deco architecture was highly influential, and has been reported to have contributed to the style's subsequent popularity in Europe and America. The New Babel Tower, for instance, has been inspired by Upper Silesian Tower in Poznań fairgrounds, which was recognized in Germany as a masterpiece of architecture.\n\nLang's visit to several Hollywood studios in the same 1924 trip also influenced the film in another way: Lang and producer Erich Pommer realized that to compete with the vertical integration of Hollywood, their next film would have to be bigger, broader, and better made then anything they had made before. Despite Ufa's growing debt, Lang announced that \"Metropolis\" would be \"the costliest and most ambitious picture ever.\"\n\nThe film drew heavily on biblical sources for several of its key set-pieces. During her first talk to the workers, Maria uses the story of the Tower of Babel to highlight the discord between the intellectuals and the workers. Additionally, a delusional Freder imagines the false-Maria as the Whore of Babylon, riding on the back of a many-headed dragon.\n\nThe name of the Yoshiwara club alludes to the famous red-light district of Tokyo.\n\nMuch of the plot line of \"Metropolis\" stems from the First World War and the culture of the Weimar Republic in Germany. Lang explores the themes of industrialization and mass production in his film; two developments that played a large role in the war. Other post-World War I themes that Lang includes in \"Metropolis\" include the Weimar view of American modernity, fascism, and communism.\n\nThe screenplay of \"Metropolis\" was written by Thea von Harbou, a popular writer in Weimar Germany, jointly with Lang, her then-husband. The film's plot originated from a novel of the same title written by Harbou for the sole purpose of being made into a film. The novel in turn drew inspiration from H. G. Wells, Mary Shelley and Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's works and other German dramas. The novel featured strongly in the film's marketing campaign, and was serialized in the journal \"Illustriertes Blatt\" in the run-up to its release. Harbou and Lang collaborated on the screenplay derived from the novel, and several plot points and thematic elements—including most of the references to magic and occultism present in the novel—were dropped. The screenplay itself went through many re-writes, and at one point featured an ending where Freder would have flown to the stars; this plot element later became the basis for Lang's \"Woman in the Moon\".\n\nThe time setting of \"Metropolis\" is open to interpretation. The 2010 re-release and reconstruction, which incorporated the original title cards written by Thea von Harbou, do not specify a year. Prior to the reconstruction, Lotte Eisner and Paul M. Jensen placed the events happening around the year 2000. Giorgio Moroder's re-scored version included a title card placing the film in 2026, while Paramount's original US release stated that the film takes place in the year 3000. A note in Harbou's novel says that the story does not take place at any particular place or time, in the past or the future.\n\n\"Metropolis\" began principal photography on 22 May 1925 with an initial budget of 1.5 million Reichsmarks. Lang cast two unknowns with little film experience in the lead roles. Gustav Fröhlich (Freder) had worked in vaudeville and was originally employed as an extra on \"Metropolis\" before Thea von Harbou recommended him to Lang. Brigitte Helm (Maria) had been given a screen test by Lang after he met her on the set of \"Die Nibelungen\", but would make her feature film debut with \"Metropolis\". In the role of Joh Fredersen, Lang cast Alfred Abel, a noted stage and screen actor whom he had worked with on \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\". Lang also cast his frequent collaborator Rudolph Klein-Rogge in the role of Rotwang. This was Klein-Rogge's fourth film with Lang, after \"Destiny\", \"Dr. Mabuse the Gambler\", and \"Die Nibelungen\".\n\nShooting of the film was a draining experience for the actors involved due to the demands that Lang placed on them. For the scene where the worker's city was flooded, Helm and 500 children from the poorest districts of Berlin had to work for 14 days in a pool of water that Lang intentionally kept at a low temperature. Lang would frequently demand numerous re-takes, and took two days to shoot a simple scene where Freder collapses at Maria's feet; by the time Lang was satisfied with the footage he had shot, actor Gustav Fröhlich found he could barely stand. Other anecdotes involve Lang's insistence on using real fire for the climactic scene where the false Maria is burnt at the stake (which resulted in Helm's dress catching fire), and his ordering extras to throw themselves towards powerful jets of water when filming the flooding of the worker's city.\n\nHelm recalled her experiences of shooting the film in a contemporary interview, saying that \"the night shots lasted three weeks, and even if they did lead to the greatest dramatic moments—even if we did follow Fritz Lang's directions as though in a trance, enthusiastic and enraptured at the same time—I can't forget the incredible strain that they put us under. The work wasn't easy, and the authenticity in the portrayal ended up testing our nerves now and then. For instance, it wasn't fun at all when Grot drags me by the hair, to have me burned at the stake. Once I even fainted: during the transformation scene, Maria, as the android, is clamped in a kind of wooden armament, and because the shot took so long, I didn't get enough air.\"\n\nUfa invited several trade journal representatives and several film critics to see the film's shooting as parts of its promotion campaign.\n\nShooting lasted 17 months, with 310 shooting days and 60 shooting nights, and was finally completed on 30 October 1926. By the time shooting finished, the film's budget leapt to 5.3 million Reichsmarks, or over three-and-and-half times the original budget. Producer Erich Pommer had been fired during production.\n\nThe effects expert Eugen Schüfftan created pioneering visual effects for \"Metropolis\". Among the effects used are miniatures of the city, a camera on a swing, and most notably, the Schüfftan process, in which mirrors are used to create the illusion that actors are occupying miniature sets. This new technique was seen again just two years later in Alfred Hitchcock's film \"Blackmail\" (1929).\n\nThe \"Maschinenmensch\" – the robot built by Rotwang to resurrect his lost love Hel – was created by sculptor Walter Schulze-Mittendorff. A whole-body plaster cast was taken of actress Brigitte Helm, and the costume was then constructed around it. A chance discovery of a sample of \"plastic wood\" (a pliable substance designed as wood-filler) allowed Schulze-Mittendorff to build a costume that would both appear metallic and allow a small amount of free movement. Helm sustained cuts and bruises while in character as the robot, as the costume was rigid and uncomfortable.\n\nThe film's original score was composed for a large orchestra by Gottfried Huppertz. Huppertz drew inspiration from Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss, and combined a classical orchestral voice with mild modernist touches to portray the film's massive industrial city of workers. Nestled within the original score were quotations of Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle's \"La Marseillaise\" and the traditional \"Dies Irae,\" the latter of which was matched to the film's apocalyptic imagery. Huppertz's music played a prominent role during the film's production; oftentimes, the composer played piano on Lang's set in order to inform the actors' performances.\n\nThe score was rerecorded for the 2001 DVD release of the film with Berndt Heller conducting the Rundfunksinfonieorchester Saarbrücken. It was the first release of the reasonably reconstructed movie to be accompanied by Huppertz's original score. In 2007, Huppertz's score was also played live by the VCS Radio Symphony, which accompanied the restored version of the film at Brenden Theatres in Vacaville, California. The score was also produced in a salon orchestration, which was performed for the first time in the United States in August 2007 by The Bijou Orchestra under the direction of Leo Najar as part of a German Expressionist film festival in Bay City, Michigan. The same forces also performed the work at the Traverse City Film Festival in Traverse City, Michigan in August 2009.\n\nFor the 2010 reconstruction DVD, the score was performed and recorded by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Frank Strobel. Strobel also conducted the premiere of the reconstructed score at Berlin Friedrichstadtpalast.\n\nThere have been many other soundtracks created for \"Metropolis\" by different artists.\n\n\n\"Metropolis\" was distributed by Parufamet, a company formed in December 1925 by the American film studios Paramount Pictures and Metro Goldwyn Mayer to loan $4 million (US) to Ufa. The film had its world premiere at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo in Berlin on 10 January 1927, where the audience, including a critic from the \"Berliner Morgenpost\", reacted to several of the film's most spectacular scenes with \"spontaneous applause\". However, others have suggested the premiere was met with muted applause interspersed with boos and hisses.\n\nAt the time of its German premiere, \"Metropolis\" had a length of 4,189 metres, which is approximately 153 minutes at 24 frames per second (fps). Ufa's distribution deal with Paramount and MGM \"entitled [them] to make any change [to films produced by Ufa] they found appropriate to ensure profitability\". Considering that \"Metropolis\" was too long and unwieldy, Parufamet commissioned American playwright Channing Pollock to write a simpler version of the film that could be assembled using the existing material. Pollock shortened the film dramatically, altered its inter-titles and removed all references to the character of Hel, because the name sounded too similar to the English word Hell, thereby removing Rotwang's original motivation for creating his robot. Pollack said about the original film that it was \"symbolism run such riot that people who saw it couldn't tell what the picture was about. ... I have given it my meaning.\" Lang's response to the re-editing of the film was to say \"I love films, so I shall never go to America. Their experts have slashed my best film, \"Metropolis\", so cruelly that I dare not see it while I am in England.\"\n\nIn Pollock's cut, the film ran for 3,170 metres, or approximately 116 minutes—although a contemporary review in \"Variety\" of a showing in Los Angeles gave the running time as 107 minutes, and another source lists it at 105 minutes. This version of \"Metropolis\" premiered in the United States in March 1927, and was released, in a slightly different and longer version (128 minutes) in the United Kingdom around the same time with different title cards.\n\nAlfred Hugenberg, a German nationalist businessman, cancelled Ufa's debt to Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after taking charge of the company in April 1927, and chose to halt distribution in German cinemas of \"Metropolis\" in its original form. Hugenberg had the film cut down to a length of 3,241 metres (about 118 minutes), broadly along the lines of Pollock's edit, removing the film's perceived \"inappropriate\" communist subtext and religious imagery. Hugenberg's cut of the film was released in German cinemas in August 1927. Later, after demands for more cuts by Nazi censors, Ufa distributed a still shorter version of the film (2,530 metres, 91 minutes) in 1936, and an English version of this cut was archived in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) film library in the 1930s. It was this version which was the basis of all versions of \"Metropolis\" until the recent restorations. In 1986, it was re-copied and returned to Germany to be the basis of the 1987 Munich Archive restoration.\n\nDespite the film's later reputation, some contemporary critics panned it. Critic Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" called it a \"technical marvel with feet of clay\". The \"Times\" went on the next month to publish a lengthy review by H. G. Wells who accused it of \"foolishness, cliché, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical progress and progress in general.\" He faulted \"Metropolis\" for its premise that automation created drudgery rather than relieving it, wondered who was buying the machines' output if not the workers, and found parts of the story derivative of Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", Karel Čapek's \"R.U.R.\", and his own \"The Sleeper Awakes\". Wells called \"Metropolis\" \"quite the silliest film.\" On the other hand, the \"New York Herald Tribune\" called it \"a weird and fascinating picture.\"\n\nWriting in \"The New Yorker\", Oliver Claxton called it \"unconvincing and overlong\", faulting much of the plot as \"laid on with a terrible Teutonic heaviness, and an unnecessary amount of philosophizing in the beginning\" that made the film \"as soulless as the city of its tale.\" He also described the acting as \"uninspired with the exception of Brigitte Helm\". Nevertheless, Claxton wrote that \"the setting, the use of people and their movement, and various bits of action stand out as extraordinary and make it nearly an obligatory picture.\" Other critics considered the film a remarkable achievement that surpassed even its high expectations, praising its visual splendour and ambitious production values.\n\nNazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels was impressed with the film's message of social justice. In a 1928 speech he declared that \"the political bourgeoisie is about to leave the stage of history. In its place advance the oppressed producers of the head and hand, the forces of Labor, to begin their historical mission\". Shortly after the Nazis came to power, Goebbels told Lang that, on the basis of their seeing \"Metropolis\" together years before, Hitler had said then that he wanted Lang to make Nazi films.\n\nInternationally, German cultural critic Siegfried Kracauer later wrote of \"Metropolis\" that \"The Americans relished its technical excellence; the English remained aloof; the French were stirred by a film which seemed to them a blend of [composer] Wagner and [armaments manufacturer] Krupp, and on the whole an alarming sign of Germany's vitality.\"\n\nFritz Lang himself later expressed dissatisfaction with the film. In an interview with Peter Bogdanovich in \"Who The Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors,\" published in 1998, he expressed his reservations:\n\nThe main thesis was Mrs. Von Harbou's, but I am at least 50 percent responsible because I did it. I was not so politically minded in those days as I am now. You cannot make a social-conscious picture in which you say that the intermediary between the hand and the brain is the heart. I mean, that's a fairy tale—definitely. But I was very interested in machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture—thought it was silly and stupid—then, when I saw the astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine? It's very hard to talk about pictures—should I say now that I like \"Metropolis\" because something I have seen in my imagination comes true, when I detested it after it was finished?\n\nIn his profile of Lang, which introduced the interview, Bogdanovich suggested that Lang's distaste for his own film also stemmed from the Nazi Party's fascination with the film. Von Harbou became a member of the Party in 1933. She and Lang divorced the following year. Lang would later move to the United States to escape the Nazis, while Harbou stayed in Germany and continued to write state-approved films.\n\nRoger Ebert noted that \"\"Metropolis\" is one of the great achievements of the silent era, a work so audacious in its vision and so angry in its message that it is, if anything, more powerful today than when it was made.\" Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide said in 2005 that the film was \"Heavy going at times but startling set design and special effects command attention throughout.\"\n\nThe film has a 99% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 118 reviews, and was ranked No. 12 in \"Empire\" magazine's \"The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema\" in 2010. It was ranked number 2 in a list of the 100 greatest films of the Silent Era. The 2002 version was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Awards \"Special Award\" for the restoration. In 2012, in correspondence with the \"Sight & Sound\" Poll, the British Film Institute called \"Metropolis\" the 35th-greatest film of all time.\n\nLane Roth in \"Film Quarterly\" called it a \"seminal film\" because of its concerns with \"profound impact technological progress has on man's social and spiritual progress\" and concluded that \"ascendancy of artifact over nature is depicted not as liberating man, but as subjugating and corrupting him\".\n\nExploring the dramatic production background and historical importance of the film's complex political context in \"The American Conservative\", Cristobal Catalan suggests \"Metropolis is a passionate call, and equally a passionate caution, for social change\". Peter Bradshaw noted that The Maschinenmensch Robot based on Maria is \"a brilliant eroticisation and fetishisation of modern technology.\"\n\nThe original premiere cut of \"Metropolis\" has been lost, and for decades the film could be seen only in heavily truncated edits that lacked nearly a quarter of the original length. However, over the years, various elements of footage have been rediscovered. This was the case even though cinematographer Karl Freund followed the usual practice of the time of securing three printable takes of each shot, to create three camera negatives which could be edited for striking prints. Two of these negatives were destroyed when the film was re-edited, by Paramount for the US market, and for the UK market. Ufa itself cut the third negative for the August 1927 release.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, the Staatliches Filmarchiv der DDR, with the help of film archives from around the world, put together a version of \"Metropolis\" which restored some scenes and footage, but the effort was hobbled by a lack of a guide, such as an original script, to determine what, exactly, was in the original version.\n\nIn 1984, a new restoration and edit of the film, running 83 minutes, was made by music producer Giorgio Moroder, who outbid David Bowie for the rights. Moroder's version, which was made in consultation with the Munich Film Archive and their archivist, Enno Patalas, was tinted, featured additional special effects, replaced intertitles of character dialogue with subtitles and incorporated a soundtrack featuring songs by popular recording artists instead of a traditional score. It was the first serious attempt made at restoring \"Metropolis\" to Lang's original vision, and until the restorations in 2001 and 2010, it was the most complete version of the film commercially available; the shorter run time was due to the extensive use of subtitles and a faster frame rate than the original.\n\nMoroder's version of \"Metropolis\" generally received poor reviews, to which Moroder responded, telling \"The New York Times\" \"I didn't touch the original because there is no original.\" The film was nominated for two Raspberry Awards, Worst Original Song for \"Love Kills\" and Worst Musical Score for Moroder.\n\nIn August 2011, after years of the Moroder version being unavailable on video in any format due to music licensing problems, it was announced that Kino International had managed to resolve the situation, and the film was to be released on Blu-ray and DVD in November. In addition, the film would have a limited theatrical re-release.\n\nThe moderate commercial success of the Moroder version inspired Enno Patalas, the archivist of the Munich Film Archive, to make an exhaustive attempt to restore the movie in 1986. Starting from the version in the Museum of Modern Art collection, this version took advantage of new acquisitions and newly discovered German censorship records of the original inter-titles, as well as the musical score and other materials from the estate of composer Gottfried Huppertz. The Munich restoration also utilized newly rediscovered still photographs to represent scenes that were still missing from the film. The Munich version was 9,840 feet, or 109 minutes long.\n\nBeginning in 1998, Martin Körber, a film preservationist, commissioned by Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, began an effort to expand on the Munich version of \"Metropolis\" to create a \"definitive\" restoration of the film. Previously unknown sections of the film were discovered in film museums and archives around the world, including a nitrate original camera negative from the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv, as well as nitrate prints from the George Eastman House, the British Film Institute and the Fondazione Cineteca Italiana. These original film elements, digitally \"cleaned\" and repaired to remove defects, were used to assemble the film. Newly written inter-titles were used to explain missing scenes.\n\nThe 2001 restoration featured a new recording of the original score by Gottfried Huppertz, performed by a 65-piece orchestra. The running time was 124 minutes. The restoration premiered on 15 February 2001 at the Berlin Film Festival, but with a new score by Bernd Schultheis, performed live by the Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin.\n\nIn 2002, in conjunction with Kino International, \"Metropolis\"s current copyright holder, the F. W. Murnau Foundation released the 2001 restoration, complete with Huppertz' original score, under the title the \"Restored Authorized Edition\".\n\nOn 1 July 2008, film experts in Berlin announced that a 16 mm reduction negative of the original cut had been discovered in the archives of the Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The negative was a safety reduction made in the 1960s or '70s from a 35 mm positive of Lang's original version, which an Argentinian film distributor had obtained in advance of arranging theatrical engagements in South America. The safety reduction was intended to safeguard the contents in case the original's flammable nitrate film stock was destroyed. The negative was passed to a private collector, an art foundation and finally the Museo del Cine.\n\nThe print was investigated by the Argentinian film collector/historian and TV presenter , along with Paula Felix-Didier, the head of the museum, after Peña heard an anecdote from a cinema club manager expressing surprise at the length of a print of \"Metropolis\" he had viewed. The print was indeed Lang's full original, with about 25 minutes of footage, around one-fifth of the film, that had not been seen since 1927.\n\nUnder the auspices of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, Berlin's Deutsche Kinemathek and Museo del Cine, a group of experts, including Anke Wilkening, Martin Körber, and Frank Strobel began combining the newly discovered footage with the existing footage from the 2001 restoration. One of their major problems was that the Argentinian footage was in very bad condition, with many scratches, streaks, and changes in brightness. Some of this they were able to overcome with digital technology, something that would not have been possible even in 2001. The reconstruction of the film with the new footage was once again aided by the original music score, including Huppertz' handwritten notes, which acted as the key resource in determining where the new footage went. Since the Argentinian print was a complete version of the original, some scenes from the 2001 restoration were put in different places than they had been in, and the tempo of the original editing was restored.\n\nIn 2005, Australian historian and politician Michael Organ had examined a print of the film in the National Film Archive of New Zealand. Organ discovered that the print contained scenes missing from other copies of the film. After hearing of the discovery of the Argentine print of the film and the restoration project, Organ contacted the German restorers; the New Zealand print contained 11 missing scenes and featured some brief pieces of footage that were used to restore damaged sections of the Argentine print. It is believed that the New Zealand and Argentine prints were all sourced from the same master. The newly discovered footage was used in the restoration project. The Argentine print was in poor condition and required considerable restoration before it was re-premiered in February 2010. Two short sequences, depicting a monk preaching and a fight between Rotwang and Fredersen, were damaged beyond repair. Title cards describing the action were inserted by the restorers to compensate. The Argentine print revealed new scenes that enriched the film's narrative complexity. The characters of Josaphat, the Thin Man, and 11811 appear throughout the film and the character Hel is reintroduced.\n\nThe new restoration was premiered on 12 February 2010 simultaneously in Berlin at the Friedrichstadt-Palast and on an outdoor screen at the Brandenburg Gate, as well as at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt am Main. The Brandenburg Gate showing was also telecast live by the Arte network. The North American premiere took place at the 2010 TCM Classic Film Festival in Mann's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on 25 April 2010. The new restoration was released on DVD and Blu-Ray by Kino Video in 2010 under the title \"The Complete Metropolis\".\n\nThe American copyright for \"Metropolis\" lapsed in 1953, which led to a proliferation of versions being released on video. Along with other foreign-made works, the film's U.S. copyright was restored in 1996 by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, but the constitutionality of this copyright extension was challenged in \"Golan v. Gonzales\" and as \"Golan v. Holder\", it was ruled that \"In the United States, that body of law includes the bedrock principle that works in the public domain remain in the public domain. Removing works from the public domain violated Plaintiffs' vested First Amendment interests.\" This only applied to the rights of so-called reliance parties, i.e. parties who had relied on the public domain status of restored works. The case was overturned on appeal to the Tenth Circuit, and that decision was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on 18 January 2012. This had the effect of restoring the copyright in the work as of 1 January 1996.\n\nThough it will remain copyrighted in Germany and the rest of the European Union until the end of 2046, seventy years after Fritz Lang's death, under current U.S. copyright law it will be copyrighted there only through 31 December 2022 due to the rule of the shorter term as implemented in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act; the U.S. copyright limit for films of its age is 95 years from publication per the Copyright Term Extension Act.\n\n\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

It originated as part of a French government project called \"Digital Great Versailles\" (in French, \"Grand Versailles Numérique\") to improve public access to the Palace of Versailles. It is located in the Jussieu pavilion, near the Grand Trianon and the Petit Trianon, on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles, which is in the Île-de-France region of France.\n\nThe Centre serves as a resource to scholars and curators researching European court culture of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. For example, such research would seek to explore the sites and expressions of power, such as those represented at Versailles and in other European courts of the same era, and join together researchers interested in this era. In addition to facilitating research, it also organises symposia and training activities such as seminars and summer schools. The websites of the Research Centre and of Grand Versailles Numérique are among those recommended by France's Ministry of Culture and Communication as \"sites préférés.\"\n\nThe building now used by the Research Centre was once occupied by Bernard de Jussieu, a member of the family of famous botanists and historians of the natural world, after whom the Paris metro station Jussieu was named. Many of the Jussieu family were associated with France's main botanical garden, the Jardin des Plantes in Paris.\n\nInitially under the direction of the Public Establishment of Versailles, the Research Centre became a Public Interest Group on 27 October 2006, with nine founding members:\n\nThis very flexible arrangement allows for the sharing of human, intellectual, material, financial, public and private resources that are necessary for the development of scientific research.\n\nThe Centre considers Court civilisation in all its aspects:\n\nThe study of these themes is allowed a flexible time frame because they often require tracing origins that strictly speaking, predate the modern period, as well as exploring more recent times. While focusing on Europe and its royal and princely courts, the geographical scope encourages comparative studies, expanding when necessary to other parts of the world. Faced with the dispersion of works and the paucity of comparative studies, the Palace of Versailles Research Centre is both a meeting place and an incentive for further research.\n\nThe Versailles Research Centre aspires to be multidisciplinary and international. It gives unity to the various works that it leads or initiates, supports new research and assures its dissemination.

The PoS is relevant for games in which there is some objective authority that can influence the players a bit, and maybe help them converge to a good Nash equilibrium. When measuring how efficient a Nash equilibrium is in a specific game we often time also talk about the price of anarchy (PoA).\n\nAnother way of expressing PoS is:\n\nIn the following prisoner’s dilemma game, since there is a single equilibrium (B, R) we have PoS = PoA = 1/2.\n\nOn this example which is a version of the battle of sexes game, there are two equilibrium points, (T, L) and (B, R), with values 3 and 15, respectively. The optimal value is 15. Thus, PoS = 1 while PoA = 1/5.\nThe price of stability was first studied by A. Schulzan and N. Moses and was so-called in the studies of E. Anshelevich. They showed that a pure strategy Nash equilibrium always exists and the price of stability of this game is at most the nth harmonic number in directed graphs. For undirected graphs Anshelevich and others presented a tight bound on the price of stability of 4/3 for a single source and two players case. Jian Li has proved that for undirected graphs with a distinguished destination to which all players must connect the price of stability of the Shapely network design game is formula_2 where formula_3 is the number of players. On the other hand, the price of anarchy is about formula_3 in this game.\n\nNetwork design games have a very natural motivation for the Price of Stability.\nIn these games, the Price of Anarchy can be much worse than the Price of Stability.\n\nConsider the following game.\n\nThe price of anarchy can be formula_20. Consider the following network design game.\n\nConsider two different equilibria in this game. If everyone shares the formula_21 edge, the social cost is formula_21. This equilibrium is indeed optimal. Note, however, that everyone sharing the formula_3 edge is a Nash equilibrium as well. Each agent has cost formula_24 at equilibrium, and\nswitching to the other edge raises his cost to formula_25.\n\nHere is a pathological game in the same spirit for the Price of Stability, instead.\nConsider formula_3 players, each originating from formula_7 and trying to connect\nto formula_28. The cost of unlabeled edges is taken to be 0.\n\nThe optimal strategy is for everyone to share the formula_25 edge, yielding\ntotal social cost formula_30. However, there is a unique Nash for this game.\nNote that when at the optimum, each player is paying formula_31, and player 1 can decrease his cost by switching to the formula_32 edge. Once this has happened, it will be in player 2's interest to switch to the formula_33 edge, and so on. Eventually, the agents will reach the Nash equilibrium of paying for their own edge. This allocation has social cost formula_34, where formula_35 is the formula_3 harmonic number, which is formula_37. Even though it is unbounded, the price of stability is exponentially better than the price of anarchy in this game.\n\nNote that by design, network design games are congestion games.\nTherefore, they admit a potential function formula_38.\n\nTheorem. [Theorem 19.13 from Reference 1] Suppose there exist constants formula_39 and formula_40\nsuch that for every strategy formula_41,\nThen the price of stability is less than formula_43\n\n\"Proof.\" The global minimum formula_44 of formula_45 is a Nash\nequilibrium, so\n\nNow recall that the social cost was defined as the sum of costs over edges, so\n\nWe trivially have formula_48, and the computation above gives formula_49, so we may invoke the theorem for an upper bound on the price of stability.\n\n\n"}

It is said that pure sea salt can ban them as the salt represents incorruptible life (salt preserves, and life was first born from the sea). In Hell, they live in the Desert of Anguish, attacking newly arrived souls as they travel down the Road of Bone to the City of the Dead.\n\nThe book \"The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria\" by Theophilus G. Pinches describes the Rabisu as being \"the seizer\" which is \"regarded as a spirit which lay in wait to pounce upon his prey\". Chapter 4 of Genesis lines 6 and 7 reads:\n\nor in Genesis 4:7:\n\nThe New American Bible among others believes that \"Demon lurking\" which in Hebrew means \"the croucher\" is similar to the word Rabisu. Therefore, it is possible that this displays a continued tradition in the emerging culture of the Hebrews.\n\nRabisu is listed in the rituals of Shurpu which are to do with burning such as the symbolic burning of witches. The Shurpu ritual allows us to banish Rabisu described as \"a demon that springs unawares on its victims\".\n\nIn the book Simon Necronomicon which contains a blend of myths including Sumerian, Rabisu are described as ancient demons. It talks about the god Marduk who battled Tiamat, Kingu, and Azag-Thoth. Among the Fifty Names of Marduk one finds the name Nariluggaldimmerankia, which is the sixth. Nariluggaldimmerankia is said to be the sub-commander of wind demons, described as the foe of Rabisu and all \"maskim\" who haunt humans. Marduk's seventh name, Asaruludu, is said to have the power using his sacred word Banmaskim to banish all Maskim and Rabisu.\n"}

He was also a prominent Shakespearean scholar, journalist, social critic, and lawyer, who was born and died in New York City.\n\nWhite was born on May 23, 1822 in New York City. He was born to Richard Mansfield White (1797–1849) and Ann Eliza (née Tousey) White (1802–1842), and was eight in descent from John White, a puritan who was one of the founders of Cambridge, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut. His father, a shipping and commission merchant, was from a wealthy old New England family that lived in New York City. The elder White also served as secretary of the Allaire Iron Works company.\n\nHis father was the second son of the Rev. Calvin White (b. 1762), who was successively a Congregational, Presbyterian, and Episcopalian minister who became a Roman Catholic in 1821. His grandfather Calvin, who served as rector of Christ’s Church in Middletown, Connecticut, was first married to Phebe Camp and secondly to Jane Mardenbrough.\n\nWhite prepared for college at Dr. Muhlenberg's Institute in Flushing on Long Island and Columbia Grammar School. He attended Bristol College in Pennsylvania from 1835 to 1837, and University of the City of New York (now known as New York University) beginning in 1837 and graduating with A.B. in 1839. He distinguished himself as a scholar of letters and mathematics and was the orator and Grand Marshal at Commencement. He later received a M.A. from New York University as well.\n\nHe studied medicine, with Dr. Alfred C. Post, and law, with Judge Woodruff, and was admitted to the Bar in 1845. White, who was brought up as a patrician New Yorker, expected to receive a sizable inheritance from his father. The inheritance never materialized as his father was forced into bankruptcy and died in poverty in 1849 when his business was ruined by the advent of steam-powered shipping.\n\nWith no inheritance allowing a life of leisure, White worked as a lawyer and became one of the foremost literary and musical critics of his day. He had a distinguished career in journalism and literature as an editorial writer and musical critic for \"The Courier and Enquirer,\" continuing when it merged into \"The New York World\". He wrote many books and articles for the leading American magazines, and contributed to Appleton's and Johnson's Cyclopedias. \"Words and Their Uses\" was one of his most noted books. White also authored several prominent national hymns. In an editorial in \"The New York Times\" after his death, it was written:\n\n\"By the death of Mr. Richard Grant White American literature loses an interesting writer and a variously accomplished man. Mr. White's Shakespearean studies are, perhaps, the most satisfactory results of his scholarship; more so, certainly, than his labors in verbal criticism. In these latter an extreme sensitiveness led him to regard every difference of opinion as almost a personal offense, and by reason of this peculiarity of temper his abilities were rated by the reading public less highly than they really deserved.\"\n\nWhile White wrote on a wide range of subjects, his essay \"The Public-School Failure\" from December 1880 that established him as a prominent and controversial social critic. His essay prompted several responses, including from \"The New York Times\" which wrote in February 1881, \"It is a libel, pure and simple, made up of an exaggerated statement of some of the poorest results contained in the report with some touches of false coloring. Mr. Whites conclusions on the first count are, therefore, vitiated. His argument that the theory of public schools is false is a 'medley of fallacies.'\"\n\nUpon the outbreak of the U.S. Civil War, White became the chief of the United States Revenue-Marine (which later became the United States Coast Guard), an armed customs enforcement service, in New York. He served in this role from 1861 to 1878.\n\nAs one of the most acute students and critics of Shakespeare, White's scholarship was recognized and praised by scholars not just in the United States but in England, France, and Germany. He published two editions of Shakespeare's works and other works, including \"Essay on the Authorship of the Three Parts of Henry VI\" (1859), and \"Riverside Shakespeare\" (1883 and 1901): and \"Shakespeare's Scholar\". He also wrote books on subjects, such as '\" and a civil war satire, \"The New Gospel of Peace, According to St. Benjamin\". He was a vice-president of the New Shakespeare Society of London, England and edited a twelve-volume edition of Shakespeare from 1857 to 1865.\n\nOn October 16, 1850, he was married to Alexina Black Maese (1830–1921), the daughter of Charles Bruton Mease and Sarah Matilda (née Graham) Mease, a Charleston family who was then living in New York. At the time of their wedding, both the bride and groom were painted by Daniel Huntington. In 1860, they were temporarily living at Ravenswood in Long Island. They had two children:\n\n\nWhite owned a violoncello now part of the collection at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nWhite died of pneumonia at his home on 330 East 17th Street in New York City on April 5, 1885. After a funeral at St. Mark's Church, he was buried at Rosedale Cemetery in Orange, New Jersey.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A second edition was published in 1762–1763, and a third edition in 1764, although this \"scarcely differed\" from the second. Further editions were published after Linnaeus' death in 1778, under the direction of Karl Ludwig Willdenow, the director of the Berlin Botanical Garden; the fifth edition (1800) was published in four volumes.\n\n' was the first botanical work to consistently apply the binomial nomenclature system of naming to any large group of organisms (Linnaeus' tenth edition of ' would apply the same technique to animals for the first time in 1758). Prior to this work, a plant species would be known by a long polynomial, such as ' (meaning \"plantain with pubescent ovate-lanceolate leaves, a cylindrical spike and a terete scape\") or ' (meaning \"\"Nepeta\" with flowers in a stalked, interrupted spike\"). In \"\", these cumbersome names were replaced with two-part names, consisting of a single-word genus name, and a single-word specific epithet or \"trivial name\"; the two examples above became \"Plantago media\" and \"Nepeta cataria\", respectively. The use of binomial names had originally been developed as a kind of shorthand in a student project about the plants eaten by cattle.\n\nAfter the specific epithet, Linnaeus gave a short description of each species, and a synonymy. The descriptions were careful and terse, consisting of few words in small genera; in \"Glycyrrhiza\", for instance, the three species (\"Glycyrrhiza echinata\", \"Glycyrrhiza glabra\" and \"Glycyrrhiza hirsuta\", respectively) were described as \"'\", \"'\" and \"\".\n\nBecause it is the first work in which binomial nomenclature was consistently applied, \"\" was chosen as the \"starting point\" for the nomenclature of most plants (the nomenclature of some non-vascular plants and all fungi uses later starting points).\n\n\"\" contained descriptions of the thousands of plant species known to Linnaeus at the time. In the first edition, there were 5,940 names, from \"Acalypha australis\" to \"Zygophyllum spinosum\".

Linnaeus' sexual system is now acknowledged to be an artificial system, rather than one which accurately reflects shared ancestry, but the system's simplicity made it easier for non-specialists to rapidly find the correct class, being based on simple counts of floral parts such as stigmas and stamens.\n\n"}
{"id": "1596346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1596346", "title": "Supreme (comics)", "text": "Supreme (comics)\n\nSupreme is a fictional superhero created by Rob Liefeld and published by Image Comics (1992–96 and 2012), followed by Maximum Press (1996–98), Awesome Entertainment (1999–2000), and Arcade Comics (2006). Although Supreme was originally a violent, egotistical Superman archetype, he was retooled by Alan Moore as a tribute to Mort Weisinger's Silver Age Superman.\n\nThe character had a 56-issue comic book series, a six-issue miniseries, and a revival in 2012 consisting of six issues. Beginning with issue #41, Moore's run was collected in two trade paperbacks from the Checker Book Publishing Group, \"Supreme: The Story of the Year\" and \"Supreme: The Return\". Moore's work on the series earned him a Eisner Award for Best Writer in 1997.\n\nSupreme was introduced in issue #3 of Rob Liefeld's \"Youngblood\" limited series as a flip book story before he was spun off into his own series. His history varied; at one point, he was an angel of vengeance who quoted the Bible to justify his actions. At other times, such as when he defeated the Norse god Thor and took his mystical hammer Mjolnir, Supreme considered himself a god. Although the most powerful being in the Liefeld universe, he had his share of defeats: he was killed in the cross-title \"Deathmate Black\" series (published by Image and Valiant Comics), lost his powers in \"Extreme Prejudice\", and was killed by Crypt in \"Extreme Sacrifice\".\n\nThe character received a comprehensive treatment in \"The Legend of Supreme\", a three-issue miniseries by Keith Giffen and Robert Loren Fleming. In the miniseries, reporter Maxine Winslow investigates Supreme's origin story. Winslow learns that in 1937, Ethan Crane shot and killed two men in retaliation for the rape of a 15-year-old girl. Crane was shot by two police officers but survived and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In prison, the government offered him a chance to participate in a human-improvement experiment in the hope that (unlike the six previous guinea pigs) he would survive.\n\nAlthough Crane died like the others, unlike them he returned to life in a world which was strange and new to him. He found his way to a church, where he received sanctuary from Father Beam and discovered some of his new abilities. Crane took the name \"Supreme\" and, hearing about the war in Europe, decided to do his part. Little was revealed about Supreme's work in World War II, except that he joined the Allies. After the war, Supreme believed that he had done his part as a good Samaritan and left Earth; in reality, Father Beam's accidental death at his hands drove him away.\n\nSupreme spent decades in space, fighting a number of threats on the side of an alien race known as the Kalyptans (the race of Gary Carlson and Erik Larsen's Vanguard). He returned to Earth in 1992 to find a changed society, which included genetically-enhanced superpowered humans on teams such as Youngblood and Heavy Mettle. Although Supreme was briefly the field team leader of Heavy Mettle, he left the position after defeating the villain Khrome.\n\nWhen Supreme fought Thor for Mjolnir, a character named Enigma acquired another Supreme from an alternate timeline to store if Supreme was defeated. Supreme was victorious, so the other Supreme was left alone; this figured in the events of \"The Legend of Supreme\". Although Supreme apparently died during an assault on humanity by Lord Chapel, he was stranded on an alternate Earth for several years until the alternate Supreme (stored by Enigma) returned and was defeated by the original Supreme. Original Supreme switched bodies with the alternate Supreme, restoring his powers. After several events involving Enigma and Probe (Supreme's daughter from the future, also known as Lady Supreme), the original Supreme worked with Probe, Enigma, and the alternate Supreme to defeat the evil Norse god Loki (who had shifted realities). At the end of \"Supreme\" #40, Probe remained on the alternate Earth and Supreme returned to Earth.\n\nRob Liefeld asked Alan Moore to write for Supreme. Moore agreed on the condition that he could reinvent the character since he felt that the comic was \"not very good.\" Beginning with issue #41 of \"Supreme\", Moore began retooling the character, with each issue containing commentary on storytelling, comics history in general and Superman in particular. Clichés of the superhero genre were frequently used. Moore said in later interviews that his re-imagining of Supreme's background and origin was an apology for the darkness of his previous works at other publishers; he had a reputation for the cynical deconstructing of superheroes in \", Swamp Thing, and Watchmen\".\n\nGiven free rein over Supreme and the wider Maximum (later Awesome) universe, Moore created a complex storyline to reinvent the Supreme universe. Drawing on Silver Age Superman and innovations by Silver Age comic artists such as Julius Schwartz, Curt Swan, and Murphy Anderson, Moore wrote the \"last\" Silver Age Superman story (\"\") for Schwartz with Swan and Anderson and referenced Anderson in his \"1963\". Moore's Supreme built on and ignored the previous issues, re-creating the character from his origins. Although the \"Story of the Year\" arc was intended to finish with a Silver Age-evoking 80-Page Giant special issue, it was split into two parts: 52a and 52b. The action, which included multiple flashbacks to earlier Supreme stories, pastiches of (and references to) comic-book staples, was tied together in #52. According to Liefeld, \"Tom Strong\" owed a debt to \"Supreme\".\n\nThe new version of Supreme had a secret identity as Ethan Crane, a mild-mannered artist for Dazzle Comics who received his powers as a result of a childhood exposure to a meteorite composed of Supremium, an element which can alter reality. When not saving the world as a superhero, Crane illustrated the adventures of Omniman, a Supreme-like character being reintroduced with a change of writers.\n\nMoore did not ignore the events of previous issues but made them central to his \"Supreme\" storyline. In Moore's first issue, Supreme returned to Earth and discovered that he was living in the most recent revision of reality (an ever-changing story) in his most-recent version. Retired Supremes lived in another reality, called the \"Supremacy\" by its inhabitants, which was an afterlife for characters whose stories had ended. Although Supreme first experienced amnesia, he learned that his returning memories were actually backstory. As his memories returned, the flashbacks to his childhood and previous adventures reflected the styles of different periods of comics history.\n\nDarius Dax, a Lex Luthor-like evil genius who was Supreme's antagonist, was introduced in this storyline. Dax died twice in the series, the first time in prison from lymphatic cancer caused by exposure to Supremium.\n\nMoore continued working on the series until \"Supreme\" #56, when it became a miniseries entitled \"Supreme: The Return\". After six issues, the miniseries was cancelled when Awesome Comics collapsed. According to artist Rick Veitch, Moore had written an additional issue or two which were never published; \"Supreme: The Return\" \"biggest failing is that the final issue of the story was never produced. This volume takes care of that little problem by ignoring it completely and just tacking 'The End' on the last story.\"\n\nAfter Darius Dax is defeated, Supreme finds an ember of Judy Jordan's consciousness in her body and transfers it to a Suprematon android. Although Judy now has superpowers, she has trouble adjusting to another body and missing the last 20 years of her life. S-1, the only other sentient Suprematon, expresses his love for her. He changes his name to Talos, and they are married by Supreme in the Flying Citadel. They leave Earth and find an uninhabited planet on which to live.\n\nEthan Crane's romance with Diana Dane falters when she becomes annoyed with the way he \"gets all weird and runs away.\" After arranging a meeting as Ethan he tries to reconcile with her as Supreme, giving her a tour of the Citadel to give her ideas for Omniman. After a trip to the Supremacy, Diana discovers Ethan's identity and is willing to continue their relationship.\n\nAfter Darius Dax becomes the Supremium meteorite at the end of \"The Story of the Year\" he is sent to Daxia, a place similar to the Supremacy. Every version of Dax before him lives in Daxia, including Darius Duck, Daxor, Daxian, Doomsdax, mad Nazi scientist Dax, and serial-killer transvestite 1980s Dax. The combined intelligence of the Daxes allows him to return to the land of the living. Again trying to destroy Supreme, he sets in motion another chain of events involving Billy Friday and Master Meteor.\n\nAt New York Comic Con 2011, Rob Liefeld and Erik Larsen announced that the last unpublished Supreme stories would be published and drawn by Larsen. \"Supreme\" #63 was published in 2012 by Image Comics, with Moore's final completed Supreme script.\n\nErik Larsen wrote and drew \"Supreme\" for five issues (#64–68), seeing Moore's work on the title purged and Liefield's early-1990s version of the character restored. On the letter page of his first issue, Larsen wrote, \"My thought was to marry the two and take what Alan had done and what came before and try to find something in the middle which might appeal to both audiences.\".\n\nHe opened with a resurrected Darius Dax and his counterparts laying siege to the Supremacy, killing Supreme's counterparts with weapons stolen from the Supremacy's armory. Supreme the Fifth (ruler of the Supremacy and the Supreme Supreme), Radar the hound Supreme, 90 percent of the past Supremes, and the supporting members of the Supremacy (including Billy Friday and Judy Jordan) are killed. To stop the killing spree, the surviving Supremes (Moore's Supreme, the 1950s Supreme with a lion's head, Squeak—the mouse Supreme, the 1970s Sister Supreme, and the original Supreme) free Rob Liefield's original Supreme from his imprisonment. Called \"mean\" Supreme in the comic, his violent, bigoted, and psychotic behavior led to his restraint with chains in a subarea of the Supremacy. Freed by \"modern\" Supreme and \"original\" Supreme, \"mean\" Supreme murders all the Darius Daxes, turns against the heroic Supremes, removes their powers with Silver Supremium, and carries the Supremacy to the Moon. \n\"Mean\" Supreme returns to a rebooted Earth and goes on a killing spree, murdering criminals to re-establish his position as the most powerful superhero on the planet. Diane Dane and \"modern\" Supreme are aware of the reboot, and she has a new life with someone other than Supreme. The Supremes try to adjust to their helplessness in ending \"mean\" Supreme's rampage. Ethan Crane learns that his alter ego's life is gone; he cannot find work as a comic-book artist because his talent came from his Supreme power. Larsen's run was poorly received and ends with the Alan Moore Supreme and his allies discussing the possibility that their powered selves still exist in the Supremacy.\n\n\nSupremium is the source of Supreme's power. As a child, Ethan Crane found a meteorite composed of pure Supremium, which turned his hair white and gave him various powers such as flight, invulnerability, strength, intelligence, and speed.\n\nIn 2006, Arcade Comics published Supreme's return in a comic by Robert Kirkman, Jon Malin, and Rob Liefeld.\n\nDuring World War II, Charles Flanders discovered he could tap into Supreme's power and became the first Kid Supreme. The second Kid Supreme, Danny Fuller, received superpowers during a fight between Supreme and Union. Alan Moore's Kid Supreme, a younger version of Supreme, is an homage to Superboy.\n\nProbe, the daughter of Glory and Supreme, is later called Lady Supreme. Although she is removed from reality by Alan Moore's retool, she still exists in the Supremacy.\n\nSupreme's sister, Sally Crane, became Suprema when she was exposed to Supremium.\n\n\"Supreme\" #23 was reprinted in the \"Extreme Sacrifice\" trade paperback () in August 1995.\n\nLicensed by Checker, using the same layout and images with a French translation:\n\nLicensed by Checker, using the same layout and images with a Spanish translation:\n\n\n\n"}

The tradition entails the use of a hobby horse with a bull's head that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a sackcloth. It represents a regional variation of a \"hooded animal\" tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles.\n\nThe Broad custom took place at Christmas time, with the folklorist Christina Hole referring to it as \"the Christmas Bull\". The Broad itself was reported as being made either from the stuffed skin of a bull's head or out of cardboard. In some cases, it had horns, glass eyes, and occasionally ribbons and rosettes. This was then affixed to a pole, held by an individual, who in some accounts was concealed under a sackcloth or sheet. There are two records, from Hawkesbury and Leighterton in Gloucestershire, in which the Broad consisted of a turnip or swede which had been hollowed out and had a candle placed within it.\nThe Broad was usually featured as part of a wassailing team, but in some cases is recorded as appearing on its own, or as part of a hero-combat play. Those who accompanied it were reported as being dressed in ordinary clothing. Sometimes they carried a wooden wassail bowl which was decorated with ribbons and sprigs of evergreen.\n\nThe tradition was located in a triangular area bounded by Stroud, Cricklade, and Chipping Sodbury. This was spread across the eastern end of the southern Cotswolds as well as an area just east of the Cotswolds itself. Within this area, it was reported as existing in ten villages in Gloucestershire, and three in Wiltshire.\n\nThe historian Ronald Hutton suggested that the custom might have developed out of older wassailing traditions.\n\nThe earliest recorded examples of the Broad came from Kingscote circa 1835, and in West Gloucestershire from between 1830 and 1840. Records of the tradition became rare after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Hutton noted that the tradition had neither survived nor been revived. Much of the folklore involving the Broad was collected by R. P. Chidlaw, who supplied it to the folklorist E. C. Cawte, who then made mention of it in his 1978 monograph on ritual animal disguises in British folklore.\n\n"}
{"id": "40695043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40695043", "title": "The Death Agony of Capitalism and the Tasks of the Fourth International", "text": "The Death Agony of Capitalism and the Tasks of the Fourth International\n\nThe Transitional Program, originally titled The Death Agony of Capitalism and the Tasks of the Fourth International and later reprinted under the title, The Transitional Program and the Struggle for Socialism, is a political platform adopted by the 1938 founding congress of the Fourth International, the international Leninist organization founded by Leon Trotsky. It is an example of a transitional programme.\n\nThe \"transitional\" idea of this program, roughly, is the following. The working class is not acquainted with the necessity of embracing the revolutionary ideas of the Fourth International due to \"the confusion and disappointment of the older generation, the inexperience of the younger generation\". Hence\n\nThe problem lay in the fact that the \"epoch of progressive capitalism\" had ended in the prior period. This meant that \"every serious demand of the proletariat\" reached beyond the limits of what the capitalist and the bourgeois state were prepared to willingly give.\n\nThe old \"minimum\" demands had been raised by reformists on the understanding that they were acceptable to an expanding capitalism, and had been dropped when they were not. The Fourth International, Trotsky writes, does not discard the program of the old “minimal” demands \"to the degree to which these have preserved at least part of their vital forcefulness.\" Trotskyists should indefatigably defend \"the democratic rights and social conquests of the workers\".\nBut in addition, transitional demands include the call for \"employment and decent living conditions for all\" and reach beyond what the capitalists will willingly give, challenging the \"very basis of the bourgeois regime.\" Demands such as higher wages are not impossible demands in themselves, Trotsky argues, but capitalism in crisis demands lower wages in the hope of increasing profitability. Transitional demands therefore do not draw back in the face of the contingencies of capitalist economics, but on the contrary, it is proposed, they continually challenge the logic of the capitalist system, expose it in the eyes of the workers, and thus help them draw towards a fully rounded out socialist consciousness - an acceptance and adoption of the \"maximum programme\" which the socialist leaders kept for their holiday speechifying, as an immediate and realistic necessity.\n\nBy fighting for these \"transitional\" demands, in the opinion of the Trotskyists, the workers will come to realize that capitalism cannot meet their needs, and they will then embrace the full program of the Fourth International.\n\nIn the face of high unemployment and high prices (meaning, in particular, inflation) the Transitional Programme raises slogans such as a \"sliding scale of wages\". This means demanding a contract with the employers which ensures that if prices go up then wages (or salaries) go up by the same extent, i.e. that wages are permanently \"inflation proofed\". This demand was won by the Italian workers in 1945-46 (the \"scala mobile\"), who fought to keep it until it was given up in the early 1990s.\n\nAlongside \"public works\" - meaning a programme of creating public amenities (health care, housing, education etc.) - a reduction in hours is also proposed for those in work, without loss of pay, so that unemployment will be reduced as more workers will have to be taken on to maintain production:\n\nThis demand also has its historical precedents. For instance, in the period of \"new unionism\" in UK working class history in 1889, and despite the often desperate conditions of working-class people of the time, Will Thorne, leader of the gas workers in the East End of London, and one time follower of Marxist ideas, won a reduction of hours from 12 hours to 8 hours, on the basis of a successful vote to strike and mass meetings preparatory to the strike. The owners of the gas industry had to move from a two shift system to a three shift system, no doubt at great expense, and the increase in employment of thousands of men was a part of the motivation for Thorne's stubborn insistence in striking for a reduction of hours without loss of pay, rather than wages.\n\nTrotsky urges that transitional demands should include the call for the expropriation of various groups of capitalists - sometimes translated in modern terms into the nationalisation of various sectors - under the control and management of the workers. Transitional demands should include opposition to imperialist war. Such demands intend to challenge the capitalist class's right to rule.\n\nThe program was formally proposed to the Congress by the National Committee of the Socialist Workers Party (US). The program was developed through discussions between Leon Trotsky, who did much of the drafting of the document, and leaders of the SWP such as James P. Cannon. Those involved were at pains to ensure that the Program was seen as a document of the FI. However, Trotskyist currents that have departed the Fourth International tend to present the Program as a work authored by Trotsky individually.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40522099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40522099", "title": "Troll cat", "text": "Troll cat\n\nA troll cat (also milk rabbit, troll ball) is the familiar of a witch in Scandinavian folklore. Either in the shape of a cat or a ball, troll cats sucked milk from cows and spat it out in the witches' milk pails, and went into homes to lick up cream. Related creatures are milk hares and milk rabbits.\n\nWitches reportedly were able to create them from \"human hair, nails, wood shavings, and the like\", and they were said to suck milk from cows and steal cream from households. Troll cats would then spit out the stolen milk into troughs next to the house. The Norwegian names \"trollnøste\" and \"trollnøa\" indicate their shapes: those troll cats looked like balls of yarn. Another type of troll cat had the shape of a regular cat; a difference between the two was that injury done to the cat-shaped troll cat would cause the same injury in the witch, whereas damaging the ball-shaped troll cat had no effect on her. In addition, it was thought that shooting a troll cat would cause milk to spray from its wound. The troll cat is easily confused with the witch's \"hug\", which could also assume the shape of a cat. The troll cat would have to be buried with the witch, or the witch would have to leave her grave to retrieve it.\n\nPeter Christen Asbjørnsen, a scholar of Norwegian folklore, retells a story in which Gypsies took advantage of farmers' beliefs in troll cats by stealing milk and blaming it on troll cats, a story they would then render believable by digging up a previously buried \"bladder filled with red water surrounded by a cat-skin\". Norwegian novelist Johan Bojer recalled an incident from 1914, when he was a lieutenant in the Army. The local women decided to raise the rent for the soldiers and he refused them permission to do so. He fell ill, and his three-day illness was explained by one of the women as a result of a troll cat having been sicced on him.\n\nA story collected in Norway, 1929, has a witch, named Lispet Snipånn, who had her farmhand collect all the wood shavings; on Thursday night she would roll them into a ball and put three drops of blood (from her finger) on it. The incantation \"Now I have given you flesh and blood. May Old Nick give you power and life\" turned the ball into a troll cat. Another spell was recorded in Sweden, 1908:\n\nSuch invocations to Satan were necessary because the witch herself was unable to give life to any of her creations. Droppings from the troll cat (or, the excess milk they had lapped up too greedily and vomited up) could, if they were burned, cause the witch to feel sympathetic pain.\n\nA related creature is the tilberi, a milk thief and witches' aide in Icelandic folklore. The tilberi (also called \"snakkur\", a spindle \"made from a dead man's rib, stolen wool, and communion wine\") plays the same role as the troll cat. One Icelandic farmer chased one on horseback and at long last it hid under the skirts of a farmer's wife. The skirt was tied up so the thief couldn't escape, and the woman was burned.\n\nThe existence of troll cats appears to be related to the observation of matter (such as hair) regurgitated by cattle. The slime mold \"Fuligo septica\" and the foam made by spittle bugs were seen as troll cat droppings. Also offered as an explanation for the belief in troll cats is the Norwegian Forest Cat, a particularly long-haired cat native to Northern Europe.\n\n"}
{"id": "1867762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867762", "title": "Wendi Richter", "text": "Wendi Richter\n\nWendi Richter (born September 6, 1961) is a retired American professional wrestler. She began her professional wrestling career in companies such as the National Wrestling Alliance, where she teamed with Joyce Grable, with whom she held the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship twice. In the 1980s, she joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). She held the WWF Women's Championship twice and feuded with The Fabulous Moolah over the title. She was also involved in a storyline with singer Cyndi Lauper called the \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection.\" Richter, however, left the WWF after losing the championship in controversial fashion. She then worked in the World Wrestling Council and American Wrestling Association, where she held both companies' women's titles.\n\nWendi Richter was trained at The Fabulous Moolah's \"Lillian Ellison School of Professional Wrestling\" by Lelani Kai, Judy Martin and Joyce Grable and made her professional debut in 1979. In early 1982, Richter tag teamed with Moolah against Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria for three matches for the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Richter was later paired with Joyce Grable, with whom she also trained for six weeks, to form a tag team called The Texas Cowgirls. In late 1982, they wrestled in a series of matches in Canada's Stampede Wrestling against Velvet McIntyre and Judy Martin. She continued her feud with McIntyre in Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling Association, where she was defeated twice. Richter and Grable continued their rivalry with McIntyre and Martin into April 1983 in Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association. In May, the team reformed in Stampede Wrestling in matches against McIntyre and Penny Mitchell. The team also won the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship twice.\n\nRichter returned stateside signing with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in late 1983. In April 1984, Richter teamed with Peggy Lee for a series of matches with old rivals Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria. WWF owner Vince McMahon brought in Cyndi Lauper for a feud with Lou Albano (who had appeared as Lauper's dad in her \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" music video). Albano seconded WWF Women's Champion Fabulous Moolah, while Lauper was in the corner of Wendi Richter. Richter defeated Moolah at MTV's \"The Brawl to End It All\" for the Women's Championship on July 23, 1984, with Richter lifting her own shoulder off the canvas during a double-pinfall situation while Moolah's shoulders remained down. With the win, she ended what was billed as the longest championship reign in professional wrestling history (Moolah's 28-year reign as recognized by the WWF; in reality she had lost the title several times between 1956 and 1978, and Richter's win had in reality only ended a nearly seven-year reign by Moolah as champion). The broadcast of the women's match earned MTV its largest ratings in history up to that point. This match was also the beginning of the \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection\", an era that combined both music and professional wrestling. Richter faced Moolah's protégé, Leilani Kai, who defeated Richter for the title, in early 1985 at \"The War to Settle the Score\". She regained the title at the first WrestleMania one month later. While wrestling for the WWF, Richter referred to herself as \"150 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal\". Richter was also animated for a CBS Saturday morning cartoon, \"Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling\". In addition, she appeared in Lauper's music video for \"She Bop\".\n\nIn 1985, after losing and then regaining the title from rival Leilani Kai at the inaugural WrestleMania, Richter was scheduled to defend her title at Madison Square Garden on November 25 of that same year against a mysterious masked opponent known only as The Spider. During the match, The Spider broke from the pre-scripted events and pinned Richter's shoulders to the mat. The referee—who was in on the plan—delivered a swift three count, despite Richter kicking out after a count of one. Richter ignored the bell and continued to attack the Spider, unmasking the new champion to reveal that it was The Fabulous Moolah in disguise.\n\nIt was reported that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when she arrived at the arena that day, she was surprised to find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took a cab to the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she never spoke to Moolah again.\n\nUpon leaving the WWF, Richter wrestled in Puerto Rico, Japan, and throughout the United States in independent promotions. In Puerto Rico's World Wrestling Council, she traded the WWC Women's Championship with Monster Ripper, holding the belt twice: once in May 1987 and once in July 1987.\n\nRichter surfaced in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1987 to challenge champion Madusa Miceli for the AWA Women's Championship, winning the title in December 1988. On December 13, 1988, she participated in a mixed tag team match at SuperClash III with partners The Top Guns (Ricky Rice and Derrick Dukes) against Badd Company (Paul Diamond and Pat Tanaka) and Madusa Miceli. Richter's team won the match when she pinned Miceli.\n\nOn January 29, 2005, Richter appeared at WrestleReunion in an eight-woman tag team match (teaming with Bambi, Malia Hosaka, and Jenny Taylor wrestling against Sherri Martel, Peggy Lee Leather, Krissy Vaine, and Amber O'Neal. In August of that same year, Richter appeared at the second WrestleReunion event, WrestleReunion 2, in a six-person tag team match.\n\nIn the years after her retirement, Richter was uninvolved with wrestling. In a 2005 shoot interview, she expressed disgust towards the portrayal of women in the WWE product, and was still hurt over her WWF exit. In 2010, Richter was offered induction in the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2010, which she accepted. She was inducted by Roddy Piper. In contrast of her shoot interviews, her speech spoke fondly of her wrestling career and how the WWE Divas thanked her for her influence. Richter's speech ended joyfully, exclaiming \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun!\"\n\nOn the June 16, 2012 episode of \"Raw\", Richter appeared in a in-ring segment along with Cyndi Lauper, Roddy Piper and then-Diva's Champion Layla as part of the \"1000th episode\" buildup. Piper expressed his gratitude to Richter and Lauper for their \"Rock 'N Wrestling\" angle and presented Lauper with a gold record, with which she eventually hit Heath Slater, who at the time had a gimmick of insulting veteran Superstars before getting his comeuppance.\n\nRichter grew up in Dallas, Texas, and before she entered the sport of professional wrestling, she worked on her family's ranch and took part in rodeo competitions. She attended Bossier High School, where she participated in volleyball, track, and cross-country. She later majored in computer programming at Dallas's Draughon's Business College. In the 1980s, she moved to Crystal River, Florida.\n\nAfter leaving the business, Richter worked as a real estate agent. She also returned to school for 13 years, earning a degree in physical therapy and a master's degree in occupational therapy. Aside from therapy, Richter competes in dog shows, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. She was once married to Hugo Savinovich, an announcer for the WWF. In 2019 she will be featured in the documentary \"Circle of Champions The History of Women's Pro Wrestling\" directed by Christopher Annino.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Within this zone, an agreement is possible. Outside the zone no amount of negotiation will yield an agreement.\n\nFor example, take a person willing to lend money at a certain interest rate over a certain period of time and a person wanting to borrow money at a certain rate. If both parties can agree a rate and period then a ZOPA can be established.\n\nAn understanding of the ZOPA is critical for a successful negotiation. To determine whether there is a ZOPA both parties must explore each other's interests and values. This should be done early in the negotiation and be adjusted as more information is learned.\n\nTo determine whether there is a positive bargaining zone each party must understand their bottom line or worst case price. \nFor example, Paul is selling his car and refuses to sell it for less than $5,000 (his worst case price). Sarah is interested and negotiates with Paul. If she offers him anything higher than $5,000 there is a positive bargaining zone, if she is unwilling to pay more than $4,500 there is a negative bargaining zone.\n\nA ZOPA exists if there is an overlap between each party's reservation price (bottom line). A negative bargaining zone is when there is no overlap. With a negative bargaining zone both parties may (and should) walk away.\n\nA negative bargaining zone may be overcome by \"enlarging the pie.\" In integrative negotiations when dealing with a variety of issues and interests, parties that combine interests to create value reach a far more rewarding agreement. Behind every position there are usually more common interests than conflicting ones.\n\nIn the example above Sarah is unwilling to pay more than $4,500 and Paul won't accept anything less than $5,000. However, Sarah may be willing throw in some skis she received as a gift but never used. Paul, who was going to use some of the car money to buy some skis, agrees. Paul accepted less than his bottom line because value was added to the negotiation. Both parties \"win.\"\n\nA negotiator should always start considering both parties' ZOPA at the earliest stage of his or her preparations and constantly refine and adjust these figures as the process proceeds. For every interest there often exists several possible solutions that could satisfy it.\n\n\n"}
