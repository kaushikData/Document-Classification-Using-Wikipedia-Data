{"id": "1052571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1052571", "title": "Acronym", "text": "Acronym\n\nAn acronym is a word or name formed as an abbreviation from the initial components of a phrase or a word, usually individual letters (as in \"NATO\" or \"laser\") and sometimes syllables (as in \"Benelux\").\n\nThere are no universal standards for the multiple names for such abbreviations or for their orthographic styling. In English and most other languages, such abbreviations historically had limited use, but they became much more common in the 20th century. Acronyms are a type of word formation process, and they are viewed as a subtype of blending.\n\nWhereas an abbreviation may be any type of shortened form, such as words with the middle omitted (for example, \"Rd\" for \"road\" or \"Dr\" for \"Doctor\"), an acronym is a word formed from the first letter or first few letters of each word in a phrase (such as \"sonar\", created from \"und vigation and anging\"). Attestations for \"\" in German are known from 1921, and for \"acronym\" in English from 1940.\n\nAlthough the word \"acronym\" is often used to refer to any abbreviation formed from initial letters, some dictionaries and usage commentators define \"acronym\" to mean an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word, in contrast to an initialism (or alphabetism)an abbreviation formed from a string of initials (and possibly pronounced as individual letters).\nSome dictionaries include additional senses equating \"acronym\" with \"initialism\". The distinction, when made, hinges on whether the abbreviation is pronounced as a word or as a string of individual letters. Examples in reference works that make the distinction include \"NATO\" , \"scuba\" , and \"radar\" for acronyms; and \"FBI\" , \"CRT\" , and \"HTML\" for initialisms. The rest of this article uses \"acronym\" for both types of abbreviation.\n\nThe distinction is not well-maintained. According to \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage\": \"A number of commentators ... believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not. ... \"Initialism\", an older word than \"acronym\", seems to be too little known to the general public to serve as the customary term standing in contrast with \"acronym\" in a narrow sense.\" About the use of \"acronym\" to only mean those pronounced as words, \"Fowler's Modern English Usage\" (3rd ed.) states: \"The limitations of the term being not widely known to the general public, \"acronym\" is also often applied to abbreviations that are familiar but are not pronounceable as words. ... Such terms are also called \"initialisms\".\"\n\nA clearer distinction has also been drawn by Pyles & Algeo (1970), who divided \"acronyms\" as a general category into \"word acronyms\" pronounced as words, and \"initialisms\" sounded out as letters.\n\nThere is no special term for abbreviations whose pronunciation involves the combination of letter names and words or word-like pronunciations of strings of letters, such as \"JPEG\" and \"MS-DOS\" . There is also some disagreement as to what to call abbreviations that some speakers pronounce as letters and others pronounce as a word. For example, the terms \"URL\" and \"IRA\" can be pronounced as individual letters: and , respectively; or as a single word: and , respectively.\nThe spelled-out form of an acronym or initialism (that is, what it stands for) is called its \"expansion\".\n\n\nAcronymy, like retronymy, is a linguistic process that has existed throughout history but for which there was little to no naming, conscious attention, or systematic analysis until relatively recent times. Like retronymy, it became much more common in the 20th century than it had formerly been.\n\nAncient examples of acronymy (regardless of whether there was metalanguage at the time to describe it) include the following:\n\nDuring the mid- to late-19th century, an acronym-disseminating trend spread through the American and European business communities: abbreviating corporation names in places where space was limited for writing—such as on the sides of railroad cars (e.g., Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad → RF&P); on the sides of barrels and crates; and on ticker tape and in the small-print newspaper stock listings that got their data from it (e.g., American Telephone and Telegraph Company → AT&T). Some well-known commercial examples dating from the 1890s through 1920s include Nabisco (National Biscuit Company), Esso (from S.O., from Standard Oil), and Sunoco (Sun Oil Company).\n\nAnother driver for the adoption of acronyms was modern warfare with its many highly technical terms. While there is no recorded use of military acronyms in documents dating from the American Civil War (acronyms such as ANV for \"Army of Northern Virginia\" post-date the war itself), they had become somewhat common in World War I and were very much a part even of the vernacular language of the soldiers during World War II, who themselves were referred to as G.I.s.\n\nThe widespread, frequent use of acronyms across the whole range of registers is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century. As literacy rates rose, and as advances in science and technology brought with them a constant stream of new (and sometimes more complex) terms and concepts, the practice of abbreviating terms became increasingly convenient. The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") records the first printed use of the word \"initialism\" as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after \"acronym\" had become common.\n\nBy 1943, the term \"acronym\" had been used in English to recognize abbreviations (and contractions of phrases) that were pronounced as words. (It was formed from the Greek words , ', \"topmost, extreme\" and , ', \"name.\") For example, the army offense of being \"absent without official leave\" was abbreviated to \"A.W.O.L.\" in reports, but when pronounced as a word (\"awol\"), it became an acronym. While initial letters are commonly used to form an acronym, the original definition was \"a word made from the initial letters or syllables of other words\", for example UNIVAC from UNIVersal Automatic Computer.\n\nIn English, acronyms \"pronounced as words\" may be a 20th-century phenomenon. Linguist David Wilton in \"Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends\" claims that \"forming words from acronyms is a distinctly twentieth- (and now twenty-first-) century phenomenon. There is only one known pre-twentieth-century [English] word with an acronymic origin and it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886. The word is \"colinderies\" or \"colinda\", an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition held in London in that year.\" However, although acronymic words seem not to have been \"employed in general vocabulary\" before the 20th century (as Wilton points out), the \"concept of their formation\" is treated as effortlessly understood (and evidently not novel) in a Poe story of the 1830s, \"How to Write a Blackwood Article\", which includes the contrived acronym P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H.\n\nThe use of Latin and Neo-Latin terms in vernaculars has been pan-European and predates modern English. Some examples of acronyms in this class are:\n\n\nThe earliest example of a word derived from an acronym listed by the \"OED\" is \"abjud\" (now \"abjad\"), formed from the original first four letters of the Arabic alphabet in the late 18th century. Some acrostics predate this, however, such as the Restoration witticism arranging the names of some members of Charles II's Committee for Foreign Affairs to produce the \"CABAL\" ministry.\n\nAcronyms are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms. The armed forces and government agencies frequently employ acronyms; some well-known examples from the United States are among the \"alphabet agencies\" (also jokingly referred to as \"alphabet soup\") created by Franklin D. Roosevelt (also of course known as FDR) under the New Deal. Business and industry also are prolific coiners of acronyms. The rapid advance of science and technology in recent centuries seems to be an underlying force driving the usage, as new inventions and concepts with multiword names create a demand for shorter, more manageable names. One representative example, from the U.S. Navy, is COMCRUDESPAC, which stands for \"commander, cruisers destroyers Pacific\"; it's also seen as \"ComCruDesPac\". \"YABA-compatible\" (where YABA stands for \"yet another bloody acronym\") is used to mean that a term's acronym can be pronounced but is not an offensive word, e.g., \"When choosing a new name, be sure it is 'YABA-compatible'.\"\n\nAcronym use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with Short Message Systems (SMS). To fit messages into the 160-character SMS limit, acronyms such as \"GF\" (girlfriend), \"LOL\" (laughing out loud), and \"DL\" (download or down low) have become popular. Some prescriptivists disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use \"pure\" or \"proper\" English. Others point out that language change has happened for thousands of years, and argue that it should be embraced as inevitable, or as innovation that adapts the language to changing circumstances. In this view, the modern practice is just as legitimate as those in \"proper\" English of the current generation of speakers, such as the abbreviation of corporation names in places with limited writing space (e.g., ticker tape, newspaper column inches).\n\nIn formal writing for a broad audience, the expansion is typically given at the first occurrence of the acronym within a given text, for the benefit of those readers who do not know what it stands for. The capitalization of the original term is independent of it being acronymized, being lowercase for a common noun such as frequently asked questions (FAQ) but uppercase for a proper noun such as the United Nations (UN) (as explained at Case > Casing of expansions).\n\nIn addition to expansion at first use, some publications also have a key listing all acronyms used therein and what their expansions are. This is a convenience to readers for two reasons. The first is that if they are not reading the entire publication sequentially (which is a common mode of reading), then they may encounter an acronym without having seen its expansion. Having a key at the start or end of the publication obviates skimming over the text searching for an earlier use to find the expansion. (This is especially important in the print medium, where no search utility is available.) The second reason for the key feature is its pedagogical value in educational works such as textbooks. It gives students a way to review the meanings of the acronyms introduced in a chapter after they have done the line-by-line reading, and also a way to quiz themselves on the meanings (by covering up the expansion column and recalling the expansions from memory, then checking their answers by uncovering). In addition, this feature enables readers possessing knowledge of the abbreviations not to have to encounter expansions (redundant to such readers).\n\nExpansion at first use and the abbreviation-key feature are aids to the reader that originated in the print era, and they are equally useful in print and online. In addition, the online medium offers yet more aids, such as tooltips, hyperlinks, and rapid search via search engine technology.\n\nAcronyms often occur in jargon. An acronym may have different meanings in different areas of industry, writing, and scholarship. The general reason for this is convenience and succinctness for specialists, although it has led some to obfuscate the meaning either intentionally, to deter those without such domain-specific knowledge, or unintentionally, by creating an acronym that already existed.\n\nThe medical literature has been struggling to control the proliferation of acronyms as their use has evolved from aiding communication to hindering it. This has become such a problem that it is even evaluated at the level of medical academies such as the American Academy of Dermatology.\nAcronyms are often taught as mnemonic devices, for example in physics the colors of the visible spectrum are ROY G. BIV (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet). They are also used as mental checklists, for example in aviation: GUMPS, which is Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Propeller-Seatbelts. Other examples of mnemonic acronyms include CAN SLIM, and PAVPANIC as well as PEMDAS.\n\nIt is not uncommon for acronyms to be cited in a kind of false etymology, called a \"folk etymology\", for a word. Such etymologies persist in popular culture but have no factual basis in historical linguistics, and are examples of language-related urban legends. For example, \"cop\" is commonly cited as being derived, it is presumed, from \"constable on patrol,\" and \"posh\" from \"port out, starboard home\". With some of these specious expansions, the \"belief\" that the etymology is acronymic has clearly been tongue-in-cheek among many citers, as with \"gentlemen only, ladies forbidden\" for \"golf\", although many other (more credulous) people have uncritically taken it for fact. Taboo words in particular commonly have such false etymologies: \"shit\" from \"ship/store high in transit\" or \"special high-intensity training\" and \"fuck\" from \"for unlawful carnal knowledge\", or \"fornication under consent/command of the king\".\n\nIn English, abbreviations have traditionally been written with a full stop/period/point in place of the deleted part to show the ellipsis of letters—although the colon and apostrophe have also had this role—and with a space after full stops (e.g. \"A. D.\"). In the case of most acronyms, each letter is an abbreviation of a separate word and, in theory, should get its own termination mark. Such punctuation is diminishing with the belief that the presence of all-capital letters is sufficient to indicate that the word is an abbreviation.\n\nSome influential style guides, such as that of the BBC, no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis; some even proscribe it. Larry Trask, American author of \"The Penguin Guide to Punctuation\", states categorically that, in British English, \"this tiresome and unnecessary practice is now obsolete\".\n\nNevertheless, some influential style guides, many of them American, still require periods in certain instances. For example, The New York Times' guide recommends following each segment with a period when the letters are pronounced individually, as in \"K.G.B.\", but not when pronounced as a word, as in \"NATO\". The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme.\n\nWhen a multiple-letter abbreviation is formed from a single word, periods are in general not used, although they may be common in informal usage. \"TV\", for example, may stand for a \"single\" word (\"television\" or \"transvestite\", for instance), and is in general spelled without punctuation (except in the plural). Although \"PS\" stands for the single word \"postscript\" (or the Latin \"postscriptum\"), it is often spelled with periods (\"P.S.\").\n\nThe slash ('/', or \"solidus\") is sometimes used to separate the letters in a two-letter acronym, as in \"N/A\" (\"not applicable, not available\"), \"c/o\" (\"care of\") and \"w/o\" (\"without\").\n\nInconveniently long words used frequently in related contexts can be represented according to their letter count. For example, \"i18n\" abbreviates \"internationalization\", a computer-science term for adapting software for worldwide use. The \"18\" represents the 18 letters that come between the first and the last in \"internationalization\". \"Localization\" can be abbreviated \"l10n\", \"multilingualization\" \"m17n\", and \"accessibility\" \"a11y\". In addition to the use of a specific number replacing that many letters, the more general \"x\" can be used to replace an unspecified number of letters. Examples include \"Crxn\" for \"crystallization\" and the series familiar to physicians for history, diagnosis, and treatment (\"hx\", \"dx\", \"tx\").\n\nThere is a question about how to pluralize acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in \"PC's\". However, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings, allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms \"only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters\". Turabian would therefore prefer \"DVDs\" and \"URLs\" and \"Ph.D.'s\". The Modern Language Association and American Psychological Association prohibit apostrophes from being used to pluralize acronyms regardless of periods (so \"compact discs\" would be \"CDs\" or \"C.D.s\"), whereas \"The New York Times\" style guide requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods (preferring \"PC's, TV's and VCR's\").\n\nPossessive plurals that also include apostrophes for mere pluralization and periods appear especially complex: for example, \"the C.D.'s' labels\" (the labels of the compact discs). In some instances, however, an apostrophe may increase clarity: for example, if the final letter of an abbreviation is \"S\", as in \"SOS's\" (although abbreviations ending with S can also take \"-es\", e.g. \"SOSes\"), or when pluralizing an abbreviation that has periods.\n\nA particularly rich source of options arises when the plural of an acronym would normally be indicated in a word other than the final word if spelled out in full. A classic example is \"Member of Parliament\", which in plural is \"Members of Parliament\". It is possible then to abbreviate this as \"M's P.\" (or similar), as used by former Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley. This usage is less common than forms with \"s\" at the end, such as \"MPs\", and may appear dated or pedantic. In common usage, therefore, \"weapons of mass destruction\" becomes \"WMDs\", \"prisoners of war\" becomes \"POWs\", and \"runs batted in\" becomes \"RBIs\".\n\nThe argument that acronyms should have no different plural form (for example, \"If \"D\" can stand for \"disc\", it can also stand for \"discs\") is in general disregarded because of the practicality in distinguishing singulars and plurals. This is not the case, however, when the abbreviation is understood to describe a plural noun already: For example, \"U.S.\" is short for \"United States, but not \"United State\". In this case, the options for making a possessive form of an abbreviation that is already in its plural form without a final \"s\" may seem awkward: for example, \"U.S.\", \"U.S.'s\", etc. In such instances, possessive abbreviations are often forgone in favor of simple attributive usage (for example, \"the U.S. economy\") or expanding the abbreviation to its full form and \"then\" making the possessive (for example, \"the United States' economy\"). On the other hand, in speech, the pronunciation \"United States's\" sometimes is used.\n\nAbbreviations that come from single, rather than multiple, words—such as \"TV\" (\"television\")—are usually pluralized without apostrophes (\"two TVs\"); most writers feel that the apostrophe should be reserved for the possessive (\"the TV's antenna\").\n\nThe most common capitalization scheme seen with acronyms is all-uppercase (all-caps), except for those few that have linguistically taken on an identity as regular words, with the acronymous etymology of the words fading into the background of common knowledge, such as has occurred with the words \"scuba\", \"laser\", and \"radar\"—these are known as \"anacronyms\". Anacronyms (note well \"-acro-\") should not be homophonously confused with anachronyms (note well \"-chron-\"), which are a type of misnomer.\n\nSmall caps are sometimes used to make the run of capital letters seem less jarring to the reader. For example, the style of some American publications, including the \"Atlantic Monthly\" and \"USA Today\", is to use small caps for acronyms longer than three letters; thus \"U.S.\" and \"FDR\" in normal caps, but \"\" in small caps. The acronyms \"AD\" and \"BC\" are often smallcapped as well, as in: \"From \".\n\nWords derived from an acronym by affixing are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root acronym is clear. For example, \"pre-WWII politics\", \"post-NATO world\", \"DNAase\". In some cases a derived acronym may also be expressed in mixed case. For example, messenger RNA and transfer RNA become mRNA and tRNA.\n\nSome publications choose to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms, reserving all-caps styling for initialisms, writing the pronounced acronyms \"Nato\" and \"Aids\" in mixed case, but the initialisms \"USA\" and \"FBI\" in all caps. For example, this is the style used in \"The Guardian\", and BBC News typically edits to this style (though its official style guide, dating from 2003, still recommends all-caps). The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme.\n\nSome style manuals also base the letters' case on their number. \"The New York Times\", for example, keeps \"NATO\" in all capitals (while several guides in the British press may render it \"Nato\"), but uses lower case in \"UNICEF\" (from \"United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund\") because it is more than four letters, and to style it in caps might look ungainly (flirting with the appearance of \"shouting capitals\").\n\nWhile abbreviations typically exclude the initials of short function words (such as \"and\", \"or\", \"of\", or \"to\"), this is not always the case. (A similar set of words is sometimes left as lowercase in headers and publication titles.) Sometimes function words are included to make a pronounceable acronym, such as CORE (Congress of Racial Equality). Sometimes the letters representing these words are written in lower case, such as in the cases of TfL (Transport for London) and \"LotR\" (\"Lord of the Rings\"); this usually occurs when the acronym represents a multi-word proper noun.\n\nNumbers (both cardinal and ordinal) in names are often represented by digits rather than initial letters: as in \"4GL\" (Fourth generation language) or \"G77\" (Group of 77). Large numbers may use metric prefixes, as with \"Y2K\" for \"Year 2000\" (sometimes written \"Y2k\", because the SI symbol for 1000 is \"k\"—not \"K\", which stands for \"kelvin\"). Exceptions using initials for numbers include \"TLA\" (three-letter acronym/abbreviation) and \"GoF\" (Gang of Four). Abbreviations using numbers for other purposes include repetitions, such as \"W3C\" (\"World Wide Web Consortium\") and \"T3\" (\"Trends, Tips & Tools for Everyday Living\"); pronunciation, such as \"B2B\" (\"business to business\"); and numeronyms, such as \"i18n\" (\"internationalization\"; \"18\" represents the 18 letters between the initial \"i\" and the final \"n\").\n\nAlthough many authors of expository writing show a predisposition to capitalizing the initials of the expansion for pedagogical emphasis (trying to thrust the reader's attention toward where the letters are coming from), this sometimes conflicts with the convention of English orthography, which reserves capitals in the middle of sentences for proper nouns. Enforcing the general convention, most professional editors case-fold such expansions to their standard orthography when editing manuscripts for publication. The justification is that (1) readers are smart enough to figure out where the letters came from, even without their being capitalized for emphasis, and that (2) common nouns do not take capital initials in standard English orthography. Such house styles also usually disfavor bold or italic font for the initial letters. For example,\n\"the onset of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)\" or \"the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)\" if found in an unpublished manuscript would be rewritten as \"the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)\" in the final published article when following the AMA Manual of Style.\n\nSome apparent acronyms or other abbreviations do not stand for anything and cannot be expanded to some meaning. Such pseudo-acronyms may be pronunciation-based, such as BBQ (bee-bee-cue), for \"barbecue\", or K9 (kay-nine) for \"canine\". Pseudo-acronyms also frequently develop as \"orphan initialisms\"; an existing acronym is redefined as a non-acronymous name, severing its link to its previous meaning. For example, the letters of the SAT, a US college entrance test originally dubbed \"Scholastic Aptitude Test\", no longer officially stand for anything.\n\nThis is common with companies that want to retain brand recognition while moving away from an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became AT&T, Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC to de-emphasize the role of frying in the preparation of its signature dishes, and British Petroleum became BP. Russia Today has rebranded itself as RT. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.\n\nPseudo-acronyms may have advantages in international markets: for example, some national affiliates of International Business Machines are legally incorporated as \"IBM\" (for example, \"IBM Canada\") to avoid translating the full name into local languages. Likewise, \"UBS\" is the name of the merged Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation, and \"HSBC\" has replaced \"The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.\" Sometimes, companies whose original name gives a clear indication of their place of origin will use acronyms when expanding to foreign markets—for example, Toronto-Dominion Bank continues to operate under the full name in Canada, but its U.S. subsidiary is known as TD Bank, just as Royal Bank of Canada used its full name in Canada (a constitutional monarchy), but its now-defunct U.S. subsidiary was called RBC Bank.\n\nRebranding can lead to redundant acronym syndrome, as when Trustee Savings Bank became TSB Bank, or when Railway Express Agency became REA Express. A few high-tech companies have taken the redundant acronym to the extreme: for example, ISM Information Systems Management Corp. and SHL Systemhouse Ltd. Examples in entertainment include the television shows \"\" and \"Navy: NCIS\" (\"Navy\" was dropped in the second season), where the redundancy was likely designed to educate new viewers as to what the initials stood for. The same reasoning was in evidence when the Royal Bank of Canada's Canadian operations rebranded to RBC Royal Bank, or when Bank of Montreal rebranded their retail banking subsidiary BMO Bank of Montreal.\n\nAnother common example is \"RAM memory\", which is redundant because \"RAM\" (\"random-access memory\") includes the initial of the word \"memory\". \"PIN\" stands for \"personal identification number\", obviating the second word in \"PIN number\"; in this case its retention may be motivated to avoid ambiguity with the homophonous word \"pin\". Other examples include \"ATM machine,\" \"EAB bank,\" \"CableACE Award,\" \"DC Comics,\" \"HIV virus,\" Microsoft's NT Technology, and the formerly redundant \"SAT test,\" now simply \"SAT Reasoning Test\"). TNN (The Nashville/National Network) also renamed itself \"The New TNN\" for a brief interlude.\n\nSometimes, the initials continue to stand for an expanded meaning, but the original meaning is simply replaced. Some examples:\n\nA \"backronym\" (or \"bacronym\") is a phrase that is constructed \"after the fact\" from a previously existing word. For example, the novelist and critic Anthony Burgess once proposed that the word \"book\" ought to stand for \"Box Of Organized Knowledge.\" A classic real-world example of this is the name of the predecessor to the Apple Macintosh, The Apple Lisa, which was said to refer to \"Local Integrated Software Architecture\", but was actually named after Steve Jobs's daughter, born in 1978.\n\nBackronyms are often times used to comedic effect. An example of creating a backronym for comedic effect would be in naming a group or organization, the name A.C.R.O.N.Y.M stands for (among other things) \"A Clever Regiment Of Nerdy Young Men\".\n\nAcronyms are sometimes contrived, that is, deliberately designed to be especially apt for the thing being named (by having a dual meaning or by borrowing the positive connotations of an existing word). Some examples of contrived acronyms are \"USA PATRIOT\", \"CAN SPAM\", \"CAPTCHA\" and \"ACT UP\". The clothing company French Connection began referring to itself as \"fcuk\", standing for \"French Connection United Kingdom.\" The company then created T-shirts and several advertising campaigns that exploit the acronym's similarity to the taboo word \"fuck.\"\n\nThe US Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is known for developing contrived acronyms to name projects, including \"RESURRECT\", \"NIRVANA\", and \"DUDE\". In July 2010, Wired Magazine reported that DARPA announced programs to \"..transform biology from a descriptive to a predictive field of science\" named \"BATMAN\" and \"ROBIN\" for \"Biochronicity and Temporal Mechanisms Arising in Nature\" and \"Robustness of Biologically-Inspired Networks\", a reference to the Batman and Robin comic-book superheroes.\n\nThe short-form names of clinical trials and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, as well as many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as names within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of mnemonic reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in medicine include the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) and the CHARM trial (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity). The fact that RAS syndrome is often involved, as well as that the letters often don't entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the archetypal form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some moral impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the raison d'être of clinical trial acronyms, as with gene and protein symbols, is simply to have a syntactically usable and recallable short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not memorized. It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of \"cutesy\" examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short name's chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a name, rather than being a cryptic and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been (1) that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document, and (2) that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as 3 different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain them somewhere in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication. At least one study has evaluated the citation impact and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others, finding both good aspects (mnemonic help, name recall) and potential flaws (connotatively driven bias).\n\nSome acronyms are chosen deliberately to avoid a name considered undesirable: For example, \"Verliebt in Berlin\" (ViB), a German telenovela, was first intended to be \"Alles nur aus Liebe (All for Love)\", but was changed to avoid the resultant acronym \"ANAL\". Likewise, the Computer Literacy and Internet Technology qualification is known as \"CLaIT\", rather than \"CLIT\". In Canada, the Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance (Party) was quickly renamed to the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance when its opponents pointed out that its initials spelled CCRAP (pronounced \"see crap\"). (The satirical magazine \"Frank\" had proposed alternatives to CCRAP, namely SSHIT and NSDAP.) Two Irish Institutes of Technology (Galway and Tralee) chose different acronyms from other institutes when they were upgraded from Regional Technical colleges. Tralee RTC became the Institute of Technology Tralee (ITT), as opposed to Tralee Institute of Technology (TIT). Galway RTC became Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), as opposed to Galway Institute of Technology (GIT). The charity sports organization Team in Training is known as \"TNT\" and not \"TIT\". Technological Institute of Textile & Sciences is still known as TITS. George Mason University was planning to name their law school the Antonin Scalia School of Law (ASSOL) in honor of the late Antonin Scalia, only to change it to the Antonin Scalia Law School later.\n\nA macronym, or nested acronym, is an acronym in which one or more letters stand for acronyms themselves. The word \"macronym\" is a portmanteau of \"macro-\" and \"acronym\".\n\nSome examples of macronyms are: \n\nSome macronyms can be multiply nested: the second-order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy. In an informal competition run by the magazine \"New Scientist\", a fully documented specimen was discovered that may be the most deeply nested of all: RARS is the \"Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service\"; ATOVS is \"Advanced TOVS\"; TOVS is \"TIROS operational vertical sounder\"; and TIROS is \"Television infrared observational satellite\". Fully expanded, \"RARS\" might thus become \"Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service\". However, to say that \"RARS\" stands directly for that string of words, or can be interchanged with it in syntax (in the same way that \"CHF\" can be usefully interchanged with \"congestive heart failure\"), is a prescriptive misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description; the true nature of such a term is closer to anacronymic than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are. The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to \"spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations,\" but the former are irreducible in that respect; they can be annotated with parenthetical explanations, but they cannot be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way. Just as the words \"laser\" and \"radar\" function as words in syntax and cognition without a need to focus on their acronymic origins, terms such as \"RARS\" and \"CHA2DS2–VASc score\" are irreducible in natural language; if they are purged, the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule, but it cannot be described as remaining natural. Similarly, protein and gene nomenclature, which uses symbols extensively, includes such terms as the name of the NACHT protein domain, which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domain—NAIP (NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein), C2TA (major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from \"Podospora anserine\"), and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein)—but is not syntactically reducible to them. The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym, and its expansion cannot replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a name within a clause clearly parsable by human readers or listeners.\n\nA special type of macronym, the recursive acronym, has letters whose expansion refers back to the macronym itself. One of the earliest examples appears in \"The Hacker's Dictionary\" as MUNG, which stands for \"MUNG Until No Good\".\n\nSome examples of recursive acronyms are:\n\nIn English language discussions of languages with syllabic or logographic writing systems (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), \"acronyms\" describe the short forms that take selected characters from a multi-character word.\n\nFor example, in Chinese, \"university\" (/, literally \"great learning\") is usually abbreviated simply as (\"great\") when used with the name of the institute. So \"Peking University\" () is commonly shortened to ( \"north-great\") by also only taking the first character of \"Peking\", the \"northern capital\" (). In some cases, however, other characters than the first can be selected. For example, the local short form of \"Hong Kong University\" () uses \"Kong\" () rather than \"Hong\".\n\nThere are also cases where some longer phrases are abbreviated drastically, especially in Chinese politics, where proper nouns were initially translated from Soviet Leninist terms. For instance, the full name of China's highest ruling council, the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC), is \"Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China\" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会). The term then reduced the \"Communist Party of China\" part of its name through acronyms, then the \"Standing Committee\" part, again through acronyms, to create \"中共中央政治局常委\". Alternatively, it omitted the \"Communist Party\" part altogether, creating \"Politburo Standing Committee\" (政治局常委会), and eventually just \"Standing Committee\" (常委会). The PSC's members full designations are \"Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China\" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会委员); this was eventually drastically reduced to simply \"Changwei\" (常委), with the term \"Ruchang\" (入常) used increasingly for officials destined for a future seat on the PSC. In another example, the word \"全国人民代表大会\" (National People's Congress) can be broken into four parts: \"全国\" = \"the whole nation\", \"人民\" = \"people\", \"代表\" = \"representatives\", \"大会\" = \"conference\". Yet, in its short form \"人大\" (literally \"man/people big\"), only the first characters from the second and the fourth parts are selected; the first part (\"全国\") and the third part (\"代表\") are simply ignored. In describing such abbreviations, the term \"initialism\" is inapplicable.\n\nMany proper nouns become shorter and shorter over time. For example, the CCTV New Year's Gala, whose full name is literally read as \"China Central Television Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala\" (中国中央电视台春节联欢晚会) was first shortened to \"Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala\" (春节联欢晚会), but eventually referred to as simply \"Chunwan\" (春晚). Along the same vein, \"Zhongguo Zhongyang Dianshi Tai\" (中国中央电视台) was reduced to \"Yangshi\" (央视) in the mid-2000s.\n\nMany aspects of academics in Korea follow similar acronym patterns as Chinese, owing to the languages' commonalities, like using the word for \"big\" or \"great\" i.e. \"dae\" (), to refer to universities (; \"daehak,\" literally \"great learning\" although \"big school\" is an acceptable alternate). They can be interpreted similar to American university appellations, such as \"UPenn\" or \"Texas Tech.\"\n\nSome acronyms are shortened forms of the school's name, like how Hongik University (, \"Hongik Daehakgyo\") is shortened to \"Hongdae\" (, \"Hong, the big [school]\" or \"Hong-U\") Other acronyms can refer to the university's main subject, e.g. Korea National University of Education (, \"Hanguk Gyowon Daehakgyo\") is shortened to \"Gyowondae\" (교원대, \"Big Ed.\" or \"Ed.-U\"). Other schools use a Koreanized version of their English acronym. The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (, \"Hanguk Gwahak Gisulwon\") is referred to as KAIST (, \"Kaiseuteu\") in both English and Korean. The 3 most prestigious schools in Korea are known as SKY (스카이, \"seukai\"), combining the first letter of their English names (Seoul National, Korea, and Yonsei Universities). In addition, the College Scholastic Ability Test (, \"Daehak Suhang Neungryeok Siheom\") is shortened to \"Suneung\" (, \"S.A.\").\n\nThe Japanese language makes extensive use of abbreviations, but only some of these are acronyms.\n\nChinese-based words (Sino-Japanese vocabulary) uses similar acronym formation to Chinese, like for . In some cases alternative pronunciations are used, as in Saikyō for 埼京, from , rather than Saitō.\n\nNon-Chinese foreign borrowings (gairaigo) are instead frequently abbreviated as clipped compounds, rather than acronyms, using several initial sounds. This is visible in katakana transcriptions of foreign words, but is also found with native words (written in hiragana). For example, the \"Pokémon\" media franchise's name originally stood for \"pocket monsters\" ( → ), which is still the long-form of the name in Japanese, and \"wāpuro\" stands for \"word processor\" ( → ).\n\nTo a greater degree than English does, German tends toward acronyms that use initial syllables rather than initial single letters, although it uses many of the latter type as well. Some examples of the syllabic type are \"Gestapo\" rather than \"GSP\" (for ', 'secret state police'); ' rather than \"FAK\" (for ', anti-aircraft gun); ' rather than \"KP\" (for ', detective division police). The extension of such contraction to a pervasive or whimsical degree has been mockingly labeled ' (for ', strange habit of abbreviating). Examples of include ' (for ', short in the front, long in the back, i.e., a mullet) and the mocking of Adolf Hitler's title as ' (\"\", Greatest General of all Times).\n\nIt is common to take more than just one initial letter from each of the words composing the acronym; regardless of this, the abbreviation sign gershayim is always written between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym, even if by this it separates letters of the same original word. Examples (keep in mind Hebrew reads right-to-left): (for , the United States); (for , the Soviet Union); (for , Rishon LeZion); (for , the school). An example that takes only the initial letters from its component words is (\"Tzahal\", for , Israel Defense Forces). In inflected forms the abbreviation sign gershayim remains between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. \"report\", singular: , plural: ; \"squad commander\", masculine: , feminine: ).\n\nThere is also a widespread use of acronyms in Indonesia in every aspect of social life. For example, the \"Golkar\" political party stands for Partai \"Gol\"ongan \"Kar\"ya, \"Monas\" stands for \"\"Mo\"numen \"Nas\"ional\" (National Monument), the \"Angkot\" public transport stands for \"\"Ang\"kutan \"Kot\"a\" (city public transportation), \"warnet\" stands for \"\"war\"ung inter\"net\"\" (internet cafe), and many others. Some acronyms are considered formal (or officially adopted), while many more are considered informal, slang or colloquial.\n\nThe capital's metropolitan area (Jakarta and its surrounding satellite regions), \"Jabodetabek\", is another infamous acronym. This stands for \"Ja\"karta-\"Bo\"gor-\"De\"pok-\"Ta\"ngerang-\"Bek\"asi. Many highways are also named by the acronym method; e.g. \"Jalan Tol\" (Toll Road) \"Jagorawi\" (\"Ja\"karta-Bo\"gor\"-Ci\"awi\") and \"Purbaleunyi\" (\"Pur\"wakarta-\"Ba\"ndung-Ci\"leunyi\"), Joglo Semar (\"Jog\"ja-so\"lo\"-\"semar\"ang).\n\nIn some languages, especially those that use certain alphabets, many acronyms come from the governmental use, particularly in the military and law enforcement services. The Indonesian military (TNI—\"Tentara Nasional Indonesia\") and Indonesian police (POLRI—\"Kepolisian Republik Indonesia\") are infamous for heavy acronyms use. Examples include the \"Kopassus\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Pas\"ukan Khu\"sus\"; Special Forces Command), \"Kopaska\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Pas\"ukan \"Ka\"tak; Frogmen Command), \"Kodim\" (\"Ko\"mando \"Di\"strik \"M\"iliter; Military District Command—one of the Indonesian army's administrative divisions), \"Serka\" (\"Ser\"san \"K\"ep\"a\"la; Head Sergeant), \"Akmil\" (\"Ak\"ademi \"Mil\"iter; Military Academy—in Magelang) and many other terms regarding ranks, units, divisions, procedures, etc.\n\nHeavy acronym use by Indonesians, makes it difficult for foreigners and learners of Bahasa Indonesia to seek information and news in Indonesian media.\n\nAcronyms that use parts of words (not necessarily syllables) are commonplace in Russian as well, e.g. (Gazprom), for (', gas industry). There are also initialisms, such as СМИ (\"SMI\", for ', means of mass informing, i.e. mass media). Another Russian acronym, (GULag) combines two initials and three letters of the final word: it stands for (\", Chief Administration of Camps).\n\nHistorically, OTMA was an acronym sometimes used by the daughters of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia and his consort, Alexandra Feodorovna, as a group nickname for themselves, built from the first letter of each girl's name in the order of their births : Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.\n\nIn Swahili, acronyms are common for naming organizations such as TUKI, which stands for \" (the Institute for Swahili Research). Multiple initial letters (often the initial syllable of words) are often drawn together, as seen more in some languages than others.\n\nIn Vietnamese, which has an abundance of compound words, initialisms are very commonly used for both proper and common nouns. Examples include \"TP.HCM\" (', Ho Chi Minh City), \"THPT\" (', high school), \"CLB\" (', club), \"CSDL\" (', database), \"NXB\" (', publisher), \"ÔBACE\" (', a general form of address), and \"CTTĐVN\" (', Vietnamese Martyrs). Longer examples include \"CHXHCNVN\" (', Socialist Republic of Vietnam) and \"MTDTGPMNVN\" (\"\", Viet Cong). Long initialisms have become widespread in legal contexts in Vietnam. It is also common for a writer to coin an ad-hoc initialism for repeated use in an article.\n\nEach letter in an initialism corresponds to one morpheme—that is, one syllable. When the first letter of a syllable has a tone mark or other diacritic, the diacritic may be omitted from the initialism, for example \"ĐNA\" or \"ĐNÁ\" for \"\" (Southeast Asia) and \"LMCA\" or \"LMCÂ\" for \"Liên minh châu Âu\" (European Union). The letter \"Ư\" is often replaced by \"W\" in initialisms to avoid confusion with \"U\", for example \"UBTWMTTQVN\" or \"UBTƯMTTQVN\" for \"Ủy ban Trung ương Mặt trận Tổ quốc Việt Nam\" (Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front).\n\nInitialisms are purely a written convenience, being pronounced the same way as their expansions. As the names of many Vietnamese letters are disyllabic, it would be less convenient to pronounce an initialism by its individual letters. Acronyms pronounced as words are rare in Vietnamese, occurring when an acronym itself is borrowed from another language. Examples include ' (), a respelling of the French acronym \"SIDA\" (AIDS); ' (), a literal reading of the English initialism for Voice of America; and \"NASA\" (), borrowed directly from the English acronym.\n\nAs in Chinese, many compound words can be shortened to the first syllable when forming a longer word. For example, the term Việt Cộng is derived from the first syllables of \"Việt Nam\" (Vietnam) and \"Cộng sản\" (communist). This mechanism is limited to Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary. Unlike with Chinese, such shortened words are considered portmanteau words or blend words rather than acronyms or initialisms, because the Vietnamese alphabet still requires each component word to be written as more than one character.\n\nIn languages where nouns are declined, various methods are used. An example is Finnish, where a colon is used to separate inflection from the letters:\nThe process above is similar to how, in English, hyphens are used for clarity when prefixes are added to acronyms, thus \"pre-NATO policy\" (rather than \"preNATO\").\n\nIn languages such as Scottish Gaelic and Irish, where lenition (initial consonant mutation) is commonplace, acronyms must also be modified in situations where case and context dictate it. In the case of Scottish Gaelic, a lower case \"h\" is added after the initial consonant; for example, \"BBC Scotland\" in the genitive case would be written as \"BhBC Alba\", with the acronym pronounced \"VBC\". Likewise, the Gaelic acronym for \"television\" (\"gd: telebhisean\") is \"TBh\", pronounced \"TV\", as in English.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2916970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2916970", "title": "De Young Museum", "text": "De Young Museum\n\nThe M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, commonly referred as the de Young, is a fine arts museum located in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, and one of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco along with the Legion of Honor. The de Young is named for its founder, early San Francisco newspaperman M. H. de Young. Since Nov 1, 2018, Thomas P. Campbell has served as the Director and CEO of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, overseeing the de Young and Legion of Honor museums.\n\nThe museum opened in 1895 as an outgrowth of the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894 (a fair modeled on the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition of the previous year). It was housed in an Egyptian revival structure which had been the Fine Arts Building at the fair. The building was badly damaged in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and was closed for a year and a half for repairs. Before long, the museum's steady development called for a new space to better serve its growing audiences. Michael de Young responded by planning the building that would serve as the core of the de Young facility through the 20th century. Louis Christian Mullgardt, the coordinator for architecture for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, designed the Spanish-Plateresque-style building. The new structure was completed in 1919 and formally transferred by de Young to the city's park commissioners. In 1921, de Young added a central section, together with a tower that would become the museum's signature feature, and the museum began to assume the basic configuration that it retained until 2001. Michael de Young's great efforts were honored with the changing of the museum's name to the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum. Another addition, a west wing, was completed in 1925, the year de Young died. In 1929 the original Egyptian-style building was declared unsafe and demolished. By 1949, the elaborate cast concrete ornamentation of the original de Young was determined to be a hazard and removed because the salt air from the Pacific had rusted the supporting steel.\n\nAs part of the agreement that created the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco in 1972, the de Young's collection of European art was sent to the Legion of Honor. In compensation, the de Young received the right to display the bulk of the organization's anthropological holdings. These include significant pre-Hispanic works from Teotihuacan and Peru, as well as indigenous tribal art from sub-Saharan Africa. The building was severely damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. It in turn was demolished and replaced by a new building in 2005. The only remaining original elements of the old de Young are the vases and sphinxes located near the Pool of Enchantment. The palm trees in front of the building are also original to the site.\n\nThe de Young showcases American art from the 17th through the 21st centuries, international contemporary art, textiles, and costumes, and art from the Americas, the Pacific and Africa.\n\nThe American art collection consists of over 1,000 paintings, 800 sculptures, and 3,000 decorative arts objects. With works ranging from 1670 to the present day, this collection represents the most comprehensive museum survey of American art in the American West and is among the top ten collections nationally that encompass the entire history of non-indigenous American art. Since its inception in the Fine Arts Building at the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894 in Golden Gate Park, its subsequent institutionalization in the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in 1924, and its reinstallation in the new de Young in 2005, the permanent collection has evolved exponentially.\n\nIn 1978, the American art collections were transformed by the decision of John D. Rockefeller III and Blanchette Hooker Rockefeller to donate their renowned collection of 110 paintings, 29 drawings, and 2 sculptures to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco where they would be on view at the de Young. His bequest in 1979 together with her bequest in 1993 are among the Fine Arts Museums’ single most important gifts of art.\n\nThe de Young’s chronological survey of American art includes galleries devoted to art in the following areas: Native American and Spanish Colonial; Anglo-Colonial; Federal era art and Neoclassical; Victorian genre and realism; trompe l’oeil still life; the Hudson River School, Barbizon, and Tonalism; Impressionism and the Ashcan School; Arts and Crafts; Modernism; Social Realism and American Scene; Surrealism and Abstraction; Beat, Pop, and Figurative; and Contemporary.\n\nAlthough the permanent collection is national in scope, art made in California from the Gold Rush era to the present day is also on display in the de Young. Important California collections with national significance include examples of Spanish colonial, Arts and Crafts, and Bay Area Figurative and Assemblage art. Important among them are the most significant museum collections of works by Bay Area painter Chiura Obata and sculptor Ruth Asawa.\n\nThe permanent collection galleries integrate decorative arts objects with paintings and sculptures, emphasizing the artistic, social, and political context for the works on display. While essentially chronological, the installation also juxtaposes works from different cultures and time periods to emphasize the historical connections between works in the collection. Painters with paintings in this art museum include; John Singleton Copley, John Vanderlyn, Thomas Cole (\"Prometheus Bound\"), Thomas Hill, Thomas Wood (\"Newspaper Vendor\"), Samuel Brookes, John Peto, Childe Hassam, Edmund C. Tarbell (\"The Blue Veil\"), George Hitchcock, Maynard Dixon, Otis Oldfield, Granville Redmond, Thomas Hart Benton (\"Susannah and the Elders\"), David Park, Richard Diebenkorn, Mel Ramos, and Wayne Thiebaud.\n\nIn January 2017, the institution announced a significant new addition to its collection of American Art through the acquisition of 62 works by 22 contemporary African American Arts, including Thornton Dial's \"Blood And Meat: Survival For the World\" (1992) and \"Lost Cows\" (2000-1), Joe Light's \"Dawn\" (1988), Jessie T. Pettway's \"Bars\" and \"String-Pierced Columns\" (1950's), Lonnie Holley's \"Him and Her Hold the Root\" (1994) and Joe Minter's \"Camel at the Watering Hole\" (1995) The works are currently exhibited in Revelations: Art from the African American South, on view until April 1, 2018.\n\nSince 1991, the American Art Department has housed a set of the Smithsonian Institution’s Archives of American Art microfilm collection. In conjunction with the Bothin Library and department research files, the American Art Study Center is the most important research center for American art on the West Coast.\n\nIn 1988, the Fine Arts Museums made a commitment to collect international contemporary art. In addition to works in traditional media, this commitment has expanded the museums’ holdings of works in new or multiple media––including installation and conceptual works, video and other time-based media, and photography and other lens-based media––to more accurately reflect contemporary art practice.\nRecent contemporary acquisitions include \"Wall of Light Horizon\" (2005), by Sean Scully and signature sculptures by Zhan Wang and Cornelia Parker. The strength of the collection lies in artists associated with California, including \nPiotr Abraszewski, Christopher Brown, Squeak Carnwath, Jim Christiansen, Robert Colescott, Hung Liu, Bruce Nauman, Rachel Neubauer, Ed Ruscha and Masami Teraoka.\n\nLens-based and time-based media represent a new area of growth, with works by Nigel Poor, Catherine Wagner, Rebeca Bollinger, Alan Rath and the Propeller Group. The museums have also acquired works by international artists such as Anish Kapoor, Odd Nerdrum, Gottfried Helnwein, Doris Salcedo, David Nash, Barbara Hepworth, and Richard Deacon.\n\nThe Fine Arts Museums’ textiles collection boasts more than 13,000 textiles and costumes from around the world. It is one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of its type in the United States. It comprises costume and costume accessories; loom-woven textiles; non-woven fabrics such as bark cloth, felt, and knitting; and objects whose primary decoration is produced through techniques such as beading and embroidery. With holdings that span two and a half millennia and represent cultures from 125 countries, the textile arts collection enables the museums to draw connections across cultures and enrich its other collections.\n\nHighlights from the collection include extraordinary Turkmen carpets, rare 12th through 15th-century Central Asian and North Indian silks, the most important group of Anatolian kilims outside Turkey, European tapestries, and contemporary fiber art.\n\nThe de Young has exhibited fashion since the 1930s and is known for its 20th-century couture, particularly from the post–World War II era, with pieces by Dior, Balenciaga, Madame Grès, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Ralph Rucci, and Kaisik Wong. There are equally compelling collections of 18th and 19th-century European fans, an excellent lace collection, a spectacular group of European ecclesiastical vestments and furnishings, and a growing collection of contemporary wearable art. With holdings that span two and a half millennia and represent cultures from 125 countries, the textile arts collection enables the museums to draw connections across cultures and enrich other areas of the permanent collection.\n\nThroughout the year, the Lonna and Marshall Wais and Diana Dollar Knowles and Gorham B. Knowles costume and textile arts gallery hosts several exhibitions featuring the diverse range of these collections as well as important traveling exhibitions. In addition to the larger rotating textiles presentations in the main gallery, the T.B Walker Family Education Gallery houses small, didactic displays and contains study drawers illustrating representative pieces from the entire collection accentuate different textile techniques.\n\nIn August 2017 The Summer of Love Experience: Art, Fashion, and Rock & Roll marked another highlight at the de Young. The exhibition celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love and featured fashion from the late sixties from the museum's permanent collection and on loan from Bay Area independent designers. Record breaking 270,000 visitors from around the world came to the de Young to relieve the Summer of Love.\n\nMore than 1,400 stellar examples from the eastern Sudan, the Guinea coast, west and central Africa, eastern and southern Africa, and elsewhere on the continent are included in the Fine Arts Museums’ African art collection at the de Young. The African art collection is presented thematically rather than geographically, emphasizing the aesthetic and expressive qualities of the art.\n\nThe Oceanic collections were charter collections of the de Young, their nucleus formed in 1894 at the California Midwinter International Exposition in Golden Gate Park. Additional Oceanic works of sculpture, basketry, tapa, ceramics, and lithics have since been acquired, bringing the holdings to more than 3,000. Highlights of the collection include a housepost from the Iatmul people of the Sepik River in Papua New Guinea, a group of brightly painted carvings used in malanggan ceremonials of New Ireland, a roll of feather money from Nindu Island of Santa Cruz, a fan from the Marquesas Islands of Polynesia, a rare navigation figure from the Caroline Islands of Micronesia, and a selection of powerful wood carvings from the Maori peoples of New Zealand.\n\nThe Art of the Americas collections are of national significance to art history, anthropology, and world history, and they have helped establish the de Young as a primary source for cultural research and study. The extensive collection of ancient American and Native American art comprises nearly 2,000 works of art from Meso-America, Central and South America, and the West Coast of North America. Art from cultures indigenous to the American continents was a defining feature of the museum’s charter collection and continues to be an area of significant growth. Special galleries are devoted to ancient objects from Mexico, including an outstanding grouping of Teotihuacan murals.\n\nThe current building was completed by architects Jacques Herzog, Pierre de Meuron and Fong + Chan and opened on October 15, 2005. Structural, civil and geotechnical engineering was provided by Rutherford & Chekene; Arup provided mechanical and electrical engineering. Herzog & de Meuron won the competition in January 1999 beating out other short-listed architects Tadao Ando and Antoine Predock. The terrain and seismic activity in San Francisco posed a challenge for the designers Herzog & de Meuron and principal architects Fong & Chan. To help withstand future earthquakes, “[the building] can move up to three feet (91 centimeters) due to a system of ball-bearing sliding plates and viscous fluid dampers that absorb kinetic energy and convert it to heat”.\n\nA new museum structure located in the middle of an urban park was initially controversial. San Francisco voters twice defeated bond measures that were to fund the new museum project. After the second defeat, the museum itself planned to relocate to a location in the financial district. However, an effort led by generous supporters arose and kept the museum in the Golden Gate Park.\n\nThe designers were sensitive to the appearance of the building in its natural setting. Walter Hood, a landscape architect based in Oakland, designed the museum's new gardens. The entire exterior is clad in of copper, which is expected to eventually oxidize and take on a greenish tone and a distinct texture to echo the nearby eucalyptus trees. In order to further harmonize with the surroundings, shapes were cut into the top to reveal gardens and courtyards where 48 trees had been planted, the giant tree-ferns that form a backdrop for the museum entrance are particularly dramatic. 5.12 acres (20,700 square meters) of new landscaping were planted as well, with 344 transplanted trees and 69 historic boulders. The building is clad with variably perforated and dimpled copper plates, whose patina will slowly change through exposure to the elements. This exterior facade was developed and fabricated by engineers at Zahner. A 144 ft. (44 m) observation tower allows visitors to see much of Golden Gate Park's Music Concourse (see below) and rises above the Park's treetops providing a view of the Golden Gate and Marin Headlands.\n\nThe twisting 144 foot (44 m) tall tower is a distinctive feature, and can be seen rising above the canopy of Golden Gate Park from many areas of San Francisco. The museum offers a two-floor museum store, free access to the lobby and tower, and a full-service cafe with outdoor seating in the Osher Sculpture Garden. The executive chef is Lance Holton.\n\n\n"}

In order to relocate the structure to Museum grounds, builders dismantled the house. Museum workers photographed the house prior to and while the house was being dismantled. Samples of each stenciled border were excised from the plaster walls. These samples were used as models for recreating the stenciled decoration of Dutton House’s interior. The sunburst stencil painted motif over a second floor fireplace mantle was also retained and installed in the re-erected house. Museum workers added dentil molding, copied from a house in Alburg, Vermont, to the structure’s cornice. \n\nSalmon Dutton built Dutton House in Cavendish, Vermont in 1781. Having emigrated from Massachusetts, Dutton worked as a road surveyor \"(see Surveying)\", a justice of the peace, and the treasurer of the town of Cavendish. Like many homes of the period, Dutton used his house as both a residence and place of business. Continuing his tradition, Dutton’s descendants, who occupied the house until 1900, operated Dutton House as a store, an inn, and a boarding house for local mill workers. Although Dutton originally constructed Dutton House in the indigenous Saltbox style, as the building’s function changed over time, Dutton and his descendants expanded the structure. The many additions that extend from the Saltbox core reflect the tradition of “continuous” architecture common in New England in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. \n\nIn the late 1940s Redfield Proctor, Jr., Dutton’s great-great-grandson, offered the house to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, now Historic New England. As part of considering the house, architect Frank Chouteau Brown measured and delineated the house and its stencil painted walls for the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1946. Ultimately, Proctor donated the house to the Vermont Historical Society; however, in 1950 when the Vermont Highway Department’s planned road improvements threatened the structure, the Society offered it to Shelburne Museum.\n\nNineteenth-century American homeowners employed many methods in ornamenting their interiors. Rich paint colors and wallpaper were widely available in America as early as 1725 and by 1830 thousands of trade painters offered wallpapering, mural painting, and stenciling among their marketable talents. Shelburne Museum’s collection includes examples of all three types of wall treatments.\n\nMembers of the upper class often imported French and English wallpaper to adorn formal rooms such as parlors, ballrooms, and dining rooms. These papers frequently represented scenic landscapes and possessed bright colors and bold patterning that could stand out even in weak candlelight.\n\nMural painting offered an equally decorative but less expensive mode of adornment for those who could not afford to import expensive papers. Jonathan Poor, and his partner, Paine, worked as limners. Traveling around Maine, they offered their services as decorative painters charging $10 for a completed room. Represented in the Museum’s collection is an ornamental over-mantel and chimney-surround that Poor and Paine created in about 1830. Designed as part of a painted chamber of landscape murals, these paintings, with their views of busy harbors, farms, and forests, are outstanding examples of a decorative technique that is frequently lost to demolition.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, itinerant artists would stencil walls in exchange for room and board. These artists would cut patterns from thin wood or heavy paper and use them to decorate walls and furniture. Stencil House’s parlor, dining room, and entrance hall exhibit a variety of stenciled patterns, including a grape leaf border, vases of flowers, and patriotic eagles. [3]\n\nThe stencil painting in the Dutton House can be found in the front four rooms and, by and large, is only found along the outer borders of the plaster walls, dating to about 1800. A sunburst is painted over the fireplace mantle in one of the second floor rooms, and is the only plaster replaced in the house after the move from Cavendish. Samples of each of the borders from the four rooms were removed and served as guides when the house was re-erected in Shelburne. Motifs used in the Dutton House borders are found in other houses in Massachusetts, Vermont and New Hampshire. One of the motifs, a freehand decoration used in a first floor room, is also found in the Grimes House in Keene, New Hampshire. The stencil painted decoration in that house has been attributed to either Jothan Stearns or Jedutham Bullin, thus one of them may have painted the Dutton House interiors.\n\n\n"}

It is celebrated on 24 February, the National Day or Estonian Independence Day.\n\nThe declaration was drafted by the Salvation Committee elected by the elders of the Estonian Provincial Assembly. Originally intended to be proclaimed on 21 February 1918, the proclamation was delayed until the evening of 23 February, when the manifesto was printed and read out aloud publicly in Pärnu. On the next day, 24 February, the manifesto was printed and distributed in the capital, Tallinn.\n\nDuring World War I, between retreating Russian and advancing German troops, the Occupation of Estonia by German Empire nearing, the Salvation Committee of the Estonian National Council, Maapäev, declared the independence of Estonia on 24 February 1918. The German Empire did not recognise the newly declared Republic of Estonia. However, after the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I in November 1918, Germany withdrew its troops from Estonia and formally handed over power in Estonia to the Estonian Provisional Government on 19 November. The Russian Bolshevik invasion and The Estonian War of Independence followed. On 2 February 1920, the Peace Treaty of Tartu was signed by the Republic of Estonia and Bolshevist Russia. The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the League of Nations in 1921.\n\n\"MANIFESTO TO THE PEOPLES OF ESTONIA\"\n\n\"In the course of centuries never have the Estonian people lost their desire for independence. From generation to generation have they kept alive the hidden hope that in spite of enslavement and oppression by hostile invaders the time will come to Estonia \"when all splints, at both end, will burst forth into flames\" and when \"Kalev will come home to bring his children happiness.\"\"\n\n\"Now that time has arrived.\"\n\n\"An unprecedented fight between nations has crushed the rotten foundations of the Russian Tsarist Empire. All over the Sarmatian plains ruinous anarchy is spreading, threatening to overwhelm in its wake all the nations living in the former Russian Empire.

Final determination of the boundaries of the Republic in the areas bordering on Latvia and Russia will be carried out by plebiscite after the conclusion of the present World War.\"\n\n\"In the aforementioned areas the only supreme and organizing authority is the democratically supported Estonian Salvation Committee created by the Estonian National Council.\"\n\n\"The Republic of Estonia wishes to maintain absolute political neutrality towards all neighbouring states and peoples and expects that they will equally respond with complete neutrality.\"\n\n\"Estonian military troops shall be reduced to the extent necessary to maintain internal order. Estonian soldiers serving in the Russian military forces will be called home and demobilized.\"\n\n\"Until the Estonian Constituent Assembly, elected by general, direct, secret, and proportional elections, will convene and determine the constitutional structure of the country, all executive and legislative authority will remain vested in the Estonian National Council and in the Estonian Provisional Government created by it, whose activities must be guided by the following principles:\"\n\n\"1. All citizens of the Republic of Estonia, irrespective of their religion, ethnic origin, and political views, are going to enjoy equal protection under the law and courts of justice of the Republic.\"\n\n\"2. All ethnic minorities, the Russians, Germans, Swedes, Jews, and others residing within the borders of the republic, are going to be guaranteed the right to their cultural autonomy.\"\n\n\"3. All civic freedoms, the freedom of expression, of the press, of religion, of assembly, of association, and the freedom to strike as well as the inviolability of the individual and the home, shall be irrefutably effective within the territory of the Estonian Republic and based on laws, which the Government must immediately work out.\"\n\n\"4. The Provisional Government is given the task of immediately organizing courts of justice to protect the security of the citizens. All political prisoners shall be released immediately.\"\n\n\"5. The city, county, and township local governments are called upon to immediately continue their work, which has been violently interrupted.\"\n\n\"6. For maintenance of public order, people's militia, subordinated to local governments, shall be immediately organized and citizens' self-defence organizations established in the cities and rural areas.\"\n\n\"7.

In press usage and popular culture, it was used to imply a predatory business culture reaching even to the programmers.\n\nDespite many third-hand reports of Microsoft employees wearing \"FYIFV\" buttons or shirts, there is only one report of an \"actual\" \"FYIFV\" T-shirt, worn on the wearer's last day at the company.\n\nAn option allows the holder to buy the stock at a later date for the price at which the option was originally granted. Many Microsoft full-time employees were granted stock options at the start of their employment. The options vested gradually over four and a half years. Because Microsoft's stock price rose significantly between September 1986 and January 2000 and split 8 times in that period, an employee could buy the stock cheap and sell it at a considerable profit, thus reducing or removing their dependence on their Microsoft salary. Many stayed at Microsoft nevertheless because they enjoyed their work.\n\nAdam Barr, author of the book \"Proudly Serving My Corporate Masters\", tracked down a possible origin for the urban legend:\n\nBarr notes also that further options were granted each year, thus an employee could never have been \"fully vested.\"\n\nThe first third-party note of the term appears to be by Paul Andrews in the \"Seattle Times\" in 1989, in the context of Microsoft as a place where hard work and long hours were expected and rewarded:\n\nAndrews used the term again when coauthoring the book \"Gates\" with Stephen Manes in 1993.\n\nThe quote became more common as Microsoft's fortunes rose, used with the implication that alleged predatory business attitudes reached even to the programmers:\n\nThe phrase was also used with the implication that Microsoft employees were motivated only by money, rather than software quality, \"e.g.\" in a 2000 \"Wired\" article on \"United States v.

This collaboration between Hull City Council, Hull University, and the Heritage Lottery Fund made Hull the first city in the UK to unite local council and university collections under one roof.\n\nBefore the creation of the Hull History Centre, Hull's archives were kept at three separate repositories: the University of Hull, the Local Studies Library, and the Hull City Archives. The partnership that led to the purpose-built history centre in Hull began nearly ten years ago, springing out of a desire to provide greater accessibility to, and better preservation facilities for, the archives. Plans began to develop between Hull City Council and the University of Hull, and ultimately the Heritage Lottery Fund made the dream a reality by providing the Hull History Centre with a £7.7 million grant, the largest ever lottery grant for a UK archive project. Building for the centre began in late 2007 and on 25 January 2010, the Hull History Centre was finally opened to the public.\n\nThe building itself was designed by architectural firm Pringle Richards Sharratt with the goals of providing a highly accessible and visible structure, as well as a focus of local pride. The design of the upper floor features an environmentally controlled repository while the ground level features public spaces adjoined by a linear arcade overlooking a new park.\n\nThe Hull History Centre houses the combined archives of Hull City Council and the University of Hull, along with other various local studies resources.

He has also worked as an on-screen character in an authoritative role; as \"Commissioner\" of Ring of Honor and \"Management Director\" (and off-screen road agent) for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.\n\nBorn in Louisville, Kentucky, Cornette always loved wrestling, reportedly installing a ten-foot antenna on top of his house as a youth so he could watch as much regional wrestling as possible. He began working at wrestling events at the age of 14, serving as a photographer, ring announcer, timekeeper, magazine correspondent, and public relations correspondent. During this time, from attending matches at the Louisville Gardens, Cornette got to know promoter Christine Jarrett, who was also the mother of Jerry Jarrett, promoter of the Continental Wrestling Association (commonly known as the \"Memphis\" territory). His dedication was such that he timed television shows with a stopwatch and would present her with typed formats for every show.\n\nBy 1982, Cornette was now also writing programs for arena shows, having photos published in wrestling magazines, and contributing to Championship Wrestling Magazine. In August, he travelled to Memphis to see the TV match between Jerry Lawler and Ric Flair. After the show ended, Cornette was tapped on the shoulder by promoter Jerry Jarrett, and asked if he wanted to become a manager on television. As Cornette has recalled, despite his presence being tolerated at shows and TV tapings for nearly a decade, the first time he was allowed into the locker room was only after he had become a manager.\n\nBefore making his managing debut Cornette decided to go by James E. Cornette in tribute to legendary wrestling promoter Jim Barnett. Cornette made his ringside debut on September 25, 1982, managing future manager Sherri Martell. Cornette was given the gimmick of a rich kid turned inept manager whose clients kept firing him after one match. The most notable wrestlers in this angle were Dutch Mantell and Crusher Broomfield (who would later gain fame as The One Man Gang and Akeem,\"The African Dream\"). Over the next 14 months Cornette also managed Jesse Barr, and the Exotic Adrian Street. Other wrestlers included a trio in Nashville consisting of Carl Fergie, Norman Fredrich Charles III, and the Angel, a trio that he called the \"Cornette Dynasty\". After a short-lived run in Georgia through a deal Jarrett had with Ole Anderson, Cornette returned to Memphis in July 1983, and worked as co-manager alongside Jimmy Hart.\n\nIn November 1983, Mid-South promoter Bill Watts recognised his business was down, and was looking to reinvigorate his territory. Watts asked Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler to visit a TV taping and offer their opinions. Jarrett suggested a talent trade, and invited Watts to Memphis to see who he liked. After watching a Memphis TV taping, Watts took singles performers Dennis Condrey and Bobby Eaton to create a new tag team, and also took the existing team of Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson as the Rock and Roll Express. Watts also noticed the brash young manager in Cornette, and in his own words, recalled \"He was so obnoxious I wanted to slap him\", and \"I knew he was instant box office if he could get me that riled up\". As the more senior Jimmy Hart was still required by Jarrett, Watts took Cornette to manage his new team, who decided on the name The Midnight Express. Notable wrestlers in the trade who left Mid-South for Memphis included Rick Rude and Jim Neidhart.\n\nMid-South Wrestling had to that point been a territory featuring bigger wrestlers, and Cornette has stated that The Midnight Express, the Rock and Roll Express, and himself were probably the five smallest members of the roster when he arrived. The influx of the new talent had an immediate impact, and business first rebounded and then skyrocketed. It was during this time that Cornette acquired his tennis racquet which became his trademark. He has stated he had seen a college movie at the time with an obnoxious rich kid carrying a badminton racquet with him (most likely the 1983 film \"Screwballs\"), so he decided on a tennis racquet. At times Cornette loaded the racquet with a horse shoe to guard against aggressive fans.\n\nCornette and The Midnight Express debuted on Mid-South television on November 23, 1983. After the first few weeks in the territory the team faced the Mid-South tag team champions Magnum TA and Mr.Wrestling II. At a TV taping for a contract signing for an upcoming championship match, the Midnights and Cornette attacked Magnum TA and tarred and feathered him. The feud continued through to early March 1984, when The Midnight Express won the Mid-South tag team titles after Wrestling II walked out on his partner during a match.\n\nAt a TV taping on March 14, 1984, Cornette and the Midnights staged a celebration for winning the tag team titles, complete with champagne and birthday cake. While Cornette's back was turned, The Rock 'n' Roll Express ran in and shoved Cornette's face in the cake. Cornette was enraged afterwards when Bill Watts replayed the incident on TV as he thought it was funny. This led to a heated altercation between the two, which ended with Watts slapping Cornette. In following weeks, the Midnight Express and Cornette attacked and bloodied Watts leading him to come out of retirement. In a series of matches termed \"The Last Stampede\", Watts and a masked teammate in Stagger Lee (suspected to be Junkyard Dog under a mask) faced the Midnight Express and Cornette all through the territory. The stipulations were simple; if the Midnights won Cornette would run Mid-South Wrestling for 60 days; if they lost, Cornette would be stripped down and forced to wear either a diaper or a dress (the outfits varied by venue). Over 5 weeks, the Last Stampede series shattered box office records for Mid-South, with a record gate and attendance at the Sam Houston Coliseum in Texas, combined attendance of 20,000 people in Tulsa and Oklahoma City (on the same day), and a crowd of 23,000 people at the New Orleans Superdome.\n\nCornette's time in Mid-South was also notable as it marked the beginning of the rivalry with the Rock and Roll Express. Starting in May 1984 immediately following the Last Stampede series, the two teams feuded all through the remainder of the year to packed crowds all through the territory. In particular, the two teams set attendance records in Houston, Tulsa and Oklahoma City, making 1984 the most successful year in Mid-South history, and The Midnight Express and Cornette national stars.\n\nCornette has consistently acknowledged that Bill Watts's philosophy of believable and credible wrestling, with an unwavering emphasis on toughness, athleticism and serious presentation, has had a major impact on how he thinks the business should be promoted. He has described the promotion as a military school for wrestling, where Watts' strict enforcement of kayfabe, exhausting travel schedule and passionate fans made it a learning experience like no other. Cornette maintains enormous respect for Watts as a promoter, citing his ability to attract huge TV ratings and consistently sold out arenas in a low population area, and describing Watts as a genius. At the same time, he acknowledges the grind of constant matches, long drives, and fan riots was a grueling test of endurance. At one point Cornette worked 103 days straight before being ordered by doctors to have two–four weeks' bed rest. As events transpired, he took six days off before returning to action.\n\nIn describing Mid-South Wrestling, Cornette has offered the following example: \"Two weeks of our lives, fourteen days, we did two one hour TV shows, fifteen house shows, two all day promo sets, drove 4700 miles in a car while doing that, and I can't speak for anybody else, but I made - and I was only 22 years old, and just pleased as punch to be there - $5600 for two weeks. In 1984. Not bad.\"\n\nThe Midnight Express with Cornette had a short stay in World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) in Texas where they feuded mainly with The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). When opportunities in WCCW looked to go nowhere, The Midnight Express started to look elsewhere for employment and what they found would give the team national and international exposure. Cornette later reflected that they were willing to give Dallas a try, as they welcomed living in a modern city, as well as the easier travel schedule when compared to Mid-South. However the inability to get any rivalry with the Von Erichs - and therefore main event money - made the decision to leave for Charlotte an easy one.\n\nWith Cornette as manager, the team were two-time National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) World Tag Team Champions and two-time NWA United States Tag Team champions. As a manager, Cornette was known for both his loud mouth and for his ever-present tennis racket, which Cornette often used to ensure victory for his wrestlers, with the implication that the racket case was loaded. Cornette was at his best as a heel manager; fans loved to see the constantly yelling Cornette and his equally annoying charges beaten and humiliated. He and the Midnights were so hated, in fact, that they had to be escorted by police to and from the ring at the house shows and have a police escort to the city limits for fear of being attacked by overzealous fans.\n\nAdditionally, Cornette suffered a severe knee injury during a scaffold match between The Midnight Express and The Road Warriors at Starrcade '86. In a shoot interview, Cornette recounted that Dusty Rhodes convinced him to perform a dangerous stunt where he would fall off of the high scaffold, which Cornette estimated was twenty-five feet off the floor of the arena but about five feet less when measured from the ring mat to the top of the scaffold. The idea was that Paul Ellering, the manager of The Road Warriors, would chase Cornette up the scaffold. Once he was there, he would be met by Road Warrior Animal, who would assist him in getting underneath the scaffold, where Cornette would hang and then drop when ready. Cornette, however, suffered from a severe case of acrophobia and decided that the drop, which he estimated was a total of fourteen feet when he factored in his total body length of eight feet (height plus extended arm length), was, as he put it, \"way too Goddamn far.\"\n\nCondrey, Eaton, and Cornette discussed an alternative: Big Bubba Rogers, another wrestler of Cornette's, would catch the manager. However, as Rogers was wearing dark sunglasses inside the arena he misjudged his position and Cornette actually landed flat on his feet, three feet away from Rogers. Cornette tore all the ligaments in one of his knees, broke a bone and damaged the cartilage. The injury was so extensive that when Cornette finally saw a doctor to have the knee drained, the amount of blood and fluid filled an entire bedpan. Cornette later said that he knew he might get seriously hurt when he was told he would have to fall off a scaffold, but that performing in front of such a large audience was more important than his own health.\n\nIn 1989, Cornette became the color commentator for Jim Crockett Promotions' nationally syndicated NWA television show, and later took over the same role on the Saturday night TBS broadcasts alongside play-by-play announcer Jim Ross.\n\nIn 1989, Cornette became a booker on WCW's creative team. As such, Cornette helped write storylines and shape the format of its television shows. Due to friction and animosity between himself and WCW head Jim Herd, Cornette quit the company after Halloween Havoc 1990.\n\nIn January 1993 Cornette briefly returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) when WCW was doing a talent trade with Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). Bill Watts, who was the current WCW Executive Vice President, brought The Rock 'n' Roll Express back to WCW and billed them as the Smoky Mountain tag team champions. This incensed Cornette since his team the Heavenly Bodies (Stan Lane and Tom Prichard) were the current champions at the time. On the February 6, 1993 episode on \"WCW Saturday Night\", Jim Cornette, the Bodies and Bobby Eaton (who Cornette once again began to manage) confronted the Express during an interview. Bill Watts came out and suggested the Bodies should wrestle the Express. Cornette objected since he claimed that they weren't dressed for it, but the match still took place. The Express won the match by DQ when Eaton interfered in the match, and after the match while Lane held Morton, Cornette put his tennis racket over Morton while Eaton delivered his \"Alabama jam\" on Morton. Cornette then struck referee Nick Patrick, and then Cornette helped his men beat up the Express.\n\nThe following week, Watts came out with the SMW commissioner Bob Armstrong, who stated he was very upset with Cornette's recent actions, and demanded that Cornette come out to apologize for what he had done. Watts stated that the Express was scheduled to wrestle the Wrecking Crew (Rage and Fury) at SuperBrawl III, but then said the Express should wrestle the Bodies instead. Armstrong agreed with Watts and then told Cornette if his Bodies did not wrestle the Express at SuperBrawl III that he would be heavily fined, the Bodies would be stripped of the title, and that he would be suspended. Cornette was very angry and claimed \"That he hated WCW!\" and later came out to the ring with his men, and attacked two jobbers after a match, one being Joey Maggs. The Express then came out and attacked Cornette and his gang.\n\nDuring Cornette's second stint in WCW, his Heavenly Bodies teamed with Steve Austin and Brian Pillman in 8-man tag team matches against the Express and the Unified tag team champions Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas. The Bodies, Austin and Pillman lost two of those matches, one on a February 27 episode of \"WCW Worldwide\" by DQ when Cornette interfered, and one by pinfall. The feud between the Bodies and Express would take place in both SMW and WCW. Bobby Eaton would go to SMW where he would team in 6-man tag team matches with the Bodies. In one of these matches, the Express had a person covered by a sheet in their corner, and after the match Cornette with his men came to the ring to see who was under the sheet and began poking, and kicking at the sheeted man. When Cornette pulled the sheet off, it was Arn Anderson, Eaton's former tag team partner in The Dangerous Alliance, who was underneath; Cornette then fell over in shock. Eaton then tried to shake Anderson's hand, but Arn decked him. Arn said the reason for this was because after he was injured by Erik Watts at a gas station, Eaton never once called him to see how he was doing. Cornette belittled Anderson and claimed that his men were far superior to him. Eaton was also very successful in Smoky Mountain, and under Cornette's guidance he won the SMW TV title. When the Bodies faced the Express at SuperBrawl III, Eaton came out with Cornette, he was despite Cornette's protests forced to return to the dressing room. Like almost always Cornette tried to interfere in the match. When Cornette climbed onto the ring apron and began to argue with the referee, the Express won the match by pinfall when an illegal outside attempt from Eaton, who had since come back to the ring failed.\n\nA firm believer in \"old-school\" territorial wrestling, Cornette began the Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion in 1991. SMW promoted shows in Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas. By this point, however, the nature of wrestling in the U.S. had already changed irrevocably, leading Cornette to seek a working relationship with the World Wrestling Federation in 1993. This did not change the new national perception that regional promotions were \"minor league\". The move also did not help the federation's finances, and Cornette closed SMW's doors in November 1995 and sold all SMW rights and videos to the WWF. Cornette later said that he chose the wrong time to start a wrestling federation because the business as a whole was in a recession.\n\nCornette went to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1993 while still serving as promoter of SMW. As he had done in other promotions, Cornette held several positions in the WWF, including manager, color commentator and member of the booking committee. Cornette's most notable managerial role in the WWF was as the \"American spokesperson\" of WWF Champion Yokozuna. Cornette joined the WWF full-time in 1996 after the demise of SMW, and had a major role in scouting and developing new talent.\n\nOn screen, he led a top heel stable of wrestlers referred to as \"Camp Cornette\". At any given time, Cornette's charges consisted of Yokozuna, Mantaur, Vader, Owen Hart, and The British Bulldog. He also served as the manager of Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray during their brief stint in the WWF. In 1997, Cornette became a member of the WWF announce team where he served as a color commentator. It was during this time that he also began performing a series of controversial \"worked shoots\" where he would praise what he felt was right and condemn what he felt was wrong in professional wrestling. Although the segments were produced by the WWF, Cornette did not hesitate to give praise to WCW wrestlers that he felt deserved it. Cornette also became active behind the scenes working on the booking committee for several years before being removed after frequently butting heads with head writer Vince Russo. \n\nCornette also was part of the television production staff during this time but eventually left this position as well due in part to constant conflict with producer Kevin Dunn. Cornette later recounted that things came to a head in Halifax, Nova Scotia in the summer of 1997. During the production meeting for \"Raw\", which was to feature the newly signed The Patriot, Cornette repeatedly tried to steer the discussion toward the treatment of what he thought was a new top of the line heroic character. Dunn told Cornette that he found him to be \"tiresome\" for continuing to harp on the issue, which enraged Cornette to the point where he mocked Dunn's buck teeth and threatened to assault him in front of everyone in the room. He was eventually forced to apologize to Dunn for his actions.\n\nIn 1998, Cornette led an NWA invasion, based on the old Crockett Promotions territory, with a stable including Jeff Jarrett, Barry Windham and The Rock 'n' Roll Express. Later that year, Cornette managed Dan Severn and The New Midnight Express before he stepped back from managing. Cornette then did some color commentating, primarily on \"Sunday Night Heat\", before disappearing from television. Cornette returned to WWF television for one night at WrestleMania X-Seven in Houston, where he took part in the \"gimmick battle royal\" but was quickly eliminated by Hillbilly Jim.\n\nCornette later became lead booker and part owner of Ohio Valley Wrestling, WWE's lead developmental territory at the time, run by \"Nightmare\" Danny Davis. As a talent developer, Cornette had previously been instrumental in developing current and former WWE Superstars such as Kane, D'Lo Brown, Sunny and Al Snow during his time running SMW. WWE credits Cornette with helping foster numerous successful superstars including John Cena, Dave Bautista, Randy Orton and Brock Lesnar.\n\nIn May 2005, Cornette was suspended for several weeks by WWE after slapping OVW developmental wrestler Anthony Carelli backstage after Carelli had \"no-sold\" fellow wrestler The Boogeyman by laughing at him during a live OVW event. Shortly after Cornette returned from his suspension, a separate incident occurred and the WWE released him from his contract in July 2005. In the spring of 2007, Carelli, who had since been called up to the WWE as Santino Marella, appeared on a Canadian radio program where he publicly challenged Cornette to a match despite Cornette working for rival promotion TNA at the time.\n\nIn 2006, Cornette joined TNA Wrestling as the new face of TNA Management. He held the title of \"Management Director\" according to the press releases following his premiere at the Slammiversary PPV event on June 18, 2006 in Orlando, Florida. After a brief speech, he departed, but returned at the end of the show in light of the \"Orlando Screwjob\", taking the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt after Jeff Jarrett, Larry Zbyszko and Earl Hebner successfully executed a screwjob on Christian Cage and Sting.\n\nAs the figurehead \"Management Director\" of TNA, Cornette did not usually take up more than ten minutes of the show, which can be attributed to both his quick tongue and TNA's lack of desire to create another Mr. McMahon. Matt Morgan had also become Cornette's on-screen bodyguard to prevent harm to his physical being, until leaving that post to become a full-time wrestler. Part of Cornette's gimmick was that when multiple situations build up at once, he often takes care of them all swiftly by getting all the TNA wrestlers to come out to the Impact! Zone for a \"company meeting\" to hear his decisions, or exasperatedly deal swiftly with people who barge into his office. The clear impact of this feature was made evident right from the start, as the first \"company meeting\" (which aired on the edition of June 29, 2006 of \"TNA Impact!\"), where every wrestler was asked to come out and stand at either ramp, saw Cornette clear up several issues:\n\n\nCornette was released from TNA on September 15, 2009. He has said that he was released because he was not \"100 percent\" behind TNA's creative team, headed by Vince Russo.\n\nIn 2009, Cornette signed a contract with Ring of Honor to be their Executive Producer for the \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\" show on HDNet.\n\nCornette made his surprise return to ROH at Glory by Honor VIII: The Final Countdown on September 26, announcing he was the new Executive Producer for the show. Cornette made his first appearance on \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\" on the December 7 episode and immediately made waves by putting ROH champion Austin Aries into a 4-way title match later that night and created the Pick 6 contender series.\n\nOn September 8, 2010, Ohio Valley Wrestling announced that Cornette would resume his duties as the head booker of the promotion. Cornette left OVW in November 2011, when the promotion announced a working agreement with TNA. On the edition of January 21 of Ring of Honor television, Cornette announced that chairshots to the head were banned and anyone that did so would be fined $5,000. On the February 4 telecast, Cornette made another ban in which the piledriver—in any form—is banned.\n\nOn October 8, 2012, it was reported that ROH had replaced Cornette as the head booker with Hunter Johnston, a wrestler who performed under the name Delirious. ROH wrote Cornette off television by having him suffer storyline injuries at the hands of Jay Lethal. As of November 2012, it was revealed that Cornette had left the promotion. The reason for Cornette's absence stems from a outburst he had at the November 3 ROH television taping. At the taping, ROH talent Steve Corino suffered an injury, and no ROH officials were still at the venue to be able to pay for Corino's immediate medical attention or even arrange for an ambulance to be called. This left Corino in pain for hours and Cornette to be the only person there with enough power to handle the situation. Following his departure from Ring of Honor, Cornette decided to take an extended break from professional wrestling to focus on his health and work on personal projects.\n\nOn March 31, 2017, Jim Cornette made his first appearance with WWE in 12 years when he inducted The Rock 'n' Roll Express into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2017. Cornette was also featured in an episode of the WWE Network Original series \"Table For 3\" alongside Eric Bischoff and Michael Hayes. Since then Cornette made another appearance for WWE, starring in an episode of the WWE Network Original Series \"Photo Shoot\" in March 2018.\n\nCornette returned to the newly rebranded Global Force Wrestling, previously known as both TNA and Impact Wrestling, on August 17, 2017, at Destination X and fired Bruce Prichard. Cornette stated that he was put in charge by Anthem to resolve the Unified GFW World Heavyweight Championship situation. Cornette made the decision to book Low Ki as the twentieth entrant in the GFW World Heavyweight Championship gauntlet match. On September 18, Cornette confirmed he was done with GFW. He had been brought in by Jeff Jarrett and the original agreement only included one set of tapings. With Jarrett out of the company, the new GFW creative team was said to be more focused on in-ring action and less on authority figures. According to Cornette, there was no \"heat\" between him and GFW.\n\nCornette and his longtime girlfriend Stacey Goff were married October 31, 2007. Stacey was a former independent wrestling manager who went by the name \"Synn\". Synn was the OVW manager of the Disciples of Synn which included Dave Bautista.\n\nIn September 2009, during a podcast interview on \"Who's Slamming Who?\" he voiced his support for President Barack Obama's health care reform plans. He also condemned what he considered \"fearmongering\" from the Republican Party as well as calling former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin \"a useless twat\". He acknowledged having voted for Obama in the 2008 election and considers himself a Democrat. His political statements have led to media attention, including an appearance on Internet talk show \"The Young Turks\". On December 17, 2017, Cornette stated that he is a democratic socialist.\n\nKnox County, Tennessee mayor Tim Burchett declared November 17, 2014 \"Jim Cornette Day\" during a Southeastern Championship Wrestling taping in Knoxville.\n\nIn June 2017, former WWF/WCW/TNA writer Vince Russo filed a restraining order (EPO) against Cornette for \"stalking\". They have had a 20-year off-screen rivalry. Cornette then began selling autographed copies of the restraining order on his personal website.\n\nCornette is an atheist; in the past he had been highly critical of religion. Cornette has a criminal record which includes a number of assaults, mostly stemming from incidents involving fights with fans who attacked him while he was a manager in the 1980s. The record has made it difficult for him to work in Canada, which resulted in him being turned away from the border in November, 2010 resulting in a lifetime ban.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He referred to it as his \"work in hand\" that he wrote while at the Augustinian abbey of \"St. Mary of the Meadows\", associated with the House of Lancaster, where he was a canon. \n\nKnighton wrote a four-volume chronicle, first published in 1652, giving the history of England from 959 to 1366. It was originally considered that a fellow canon completed the work in a fifth book, covering the years 1377 to 1395, probably due to Knighton's growing blindness (see the \"Continuator of Knighton\", below). The earlier books (to 1337) are simply re-workings of earlier histories. But the latter two books are vital to the contemporary study of the period, since they were written by informed scholars who actually lived through the times they write about. The latter two books give us an exemplary and detailed first-hand insight into the 14th century - such as the effects of the Black Death and the consequent breakdown of the feudal system, and precise details of the systems of wages and prices in England. He also reflects the prejudices common among the clergy at the time; notably being against the translation of the Bible into the common tongue, lamenting the low standards of scholarship among young religious clerks, and being strongly against the rising of the Lollards.\n\nThe \"Continuator of Knighton\" (or \"Knighton's Continuator\") was a supposed late 14th century continuator of \"Knighton's chronicle\".\n\nThe Continuator's existence was first supposed by the nineteenth-century historian Walter Waddington Shirley, who noted a lengthy break in events described by the Chronicle, and concluded that the later section had been written by a different and unnamed author, commencing in 1377. Shirley also posited that the Continuator had been a foreigner of Lancastrian sympathies, though with little affection for the English language, who had managed to obtain a position in Leicester Abbey.\n\nShirley's theory was taken up by J. Rawson Lumby, a classicist and Hebraicist who edited \"Knighton's Chronicle\" in the 1880s for the Rolls Series. Despite some reservations about the Continuator's existence, Lumby also concluded a different author had written the post-1377 sections. His division of the Chronicle's authorship was followed by later authors, with the result that the Continuator was referenced in subsequent historical study footnotes of learned historians that followed him.\n\nThe existence of the Continuator was not questioned until 1957, when the historian Vivian Hunter Galbraith published an in-depth study of the Chronicle's chronology. In particular, he was able to prove that the section of the Chronicle covering later events, from 1377–95, was actually written \"before\" the earlier section, confirming Knighton's probable authorship of both sections. The current academic view agrees with Galbraith in that the Continuator most likely never existed, and Knighton wrote the entire Chronicle.\n\n\n"}

Common to all is that the party making the threat will take some form of action of a legal nature. Most common is the threatened initiation of a lawsuit against the second party. Other threats might include an administrative law action or complaint, referring the other party to a regulatory body, turning the party into the legal authorities over a crime or civil infraction, or the like. Legal threats are often veiled or indirect, e.g. a threat that a party \"shall be forced to consider its legal options\" or \"will refer the matter to legal counsel.\"\n\nA cease and desist (C&D) letter is a formalized legal demand that a party stop (\"cease\") and refrain (\"desist\") from an activity that the demanding party finds objectionable, generally couched in formal language accusing the activity of violating the law.\n\nThe objected-to activity may be most anything, although cease-and-desist letters are particularly common among certain areas of the law:\n\nA \"demand letter\" is a formalized demand by a party that another party pay money or take certain acts, often accompanied by a claim that the second party has engaged in illegal conduct, with an implicit or explicit threat that the demanding party will take some form of legal action.\n\nFor the most part, a legal threat is of no legal significance other than a matter of negotiation tactics; however, in certain instances a legal threat does have some legal significance.

{"id": "959966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=959966", "title": "Masterpoints", "text": "Masterpoints\n\nMasterpoints or master points are points awarded by bridge organisations to individuals for success in competitive bridge tournaments run under their auspices. Generally, recipients must be members in good standing of the issuing organisation. At the international level, competitions and point awards are administered by the World Bridge Federation (WBF); its affiliates at the multi-national level, such as the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL), also issue points as do more local organisations such as the English Bridge Union (EBU), and the Deutsche Bridge Verband (DBV) and independent ones such as the American Bridge Association (ABA).\n\nIn general, each organisation has its own scheme for the categorization of competitive bridge events and has a parallel scheme for awarding various categories of points to players who are successful in them. Upon reaching certain thresholds in point accumulation or retention, most organisations bestow a rank on the individual in recognition of their achievements. Points and rankings generally have no monetary value, but have prestige value for some players and are sought after by them over a lifetime of play.\n\nIn some cases, the point awarding scheme is an important means of raising revenue for the bridge organisation insofar as they charge entry fees for each tournament where points are awarded and their availability acts as an incentive to participation; the more prestigious the points, the higher the entry fees.\n\nIn the past, points were issued in the form of paper certificates, which gave the player a tangible record of his or her achievement, but these are now increasingly replaced by electronic recording.\n\nPlayers who achieve a high placing in an event sanctioned by the national bridge organisation (a club game, sectional tournament, regional tournament, etc.) are awarded masterpoints according to their placing and the number of pairs, individuals or teams who played in the event.\n\nSome events have an upper masterpoint limit, meaning that only players with a masterpoint holding under the limit may participate. This allows less experienced players more of a chance to place high, since they will not be playing against players who are significantly more experienced. Additionally, some events are stratified. This means that players with various masterpoint holdings play together, but in the final standings, players receive masterpoints based on their position within their stratum. For example, if you are first in stratum C, second in B and fourth in A, and the upper masterpoint limits are 300 for C, 500 for B and 1000 for A, that means that among players with fewer than 300 masterpoints, you did the best. Among players with 500 points or fewer, you did second best, and among players with fewer than 1000, you did fourth best. With those divisions, a player with 700 points would be able to place in stratum A, but not in B or C.\n\nThe ACBL awards several categories of masterpoints, each associated with the type of event and designated by a distinct color:\n\nLike most bridge governing bodies, the ACBL assigns ranks to players according to their masterpoint holdings; the requirements for its various ranks are listed below.\n\nMasterpoints are partly a measure of skill, but the system is regarded by many players as a measure of experience and longevity rather than skill. Experience is often related to skill, but not necessarily. Over the course of a lifetime, a player can earn many points, just with average play. For example, the same number of masterpoints, and hence the same rank, may have been achieved by Player A over 2 years and by Player B over 20 years.\n\nWhen an ACBL member achieves the \"Life Master\" rank, the first digit of their 7-digit ACBL number is replaced with a letter according to the following chart. (New membership cards are sent accordingly at that rank.)\n\"Masterpoint\" is a registered trademark of the ACBL in the United States.\n\nIn contrast, the World Bridge Federation system of Master Points annually reduces players' holdings of points older than one year by 15% and uses another classification of points, known as Placing Points, to record players' lifetime accumulation. The WBF also distinguishes between points earned in Open, Women's, Mixed or Senior events and awards its Titles (such as World Grand Master), based upon the accumulation and retention scheme for the particular point classification.\nSee WBF Master Point Rules and WBF Master Point Standings\n\nIt is difficult to compare masterpoints between various organizations as they are not consistent in value.\n\nThe ACBL awards new ACBL members 10% of their ABA masterpoints (up to a maximum of 200 ACBL black points) and 20% of their WBF masterpoints.\n\nFor tournament seeding, the ACBL uses 50% of a person's ABA masterpoints plus their ACBL masterpoints.\n\nFor tournament seeding, the ABA uses 200% of a person's ACBL masterpoints (if less than 5,000) plus their ABA masterpoints. If the player has 5,000+ ACBL masterpoints, they are seeded with 10,000 plus their ABA masterpoints.\n\n\n"}

It calls for the preservation of valuable archival holdings, library collections and private individual compendia all over the world for posterity, the reconstitution of dispersed or displaced documentary heritage, and the increased accessibility to and dissemination of these items.\n\nThe Memory of the World Register is a compendium of documents, manuscripts, oral traditions, audio-visual materials, library, and archival holdings of universal value. Inscription on the Register leads to improved conservation of the documentary heritage by calling upon the program's networks of experts to exchange information and raise resources for the preservation, digitization, and dissemination of the material. The program also has the goal of using state-of-the-art technologies to provide wider accessibility and diffusion of the items inscribed on the Register.\n\nAny organization or individual can nominate a documentary item for inscription on the Register. During its meetings, the IAC examines the full documentation of the item's description, origin, world significance, and contemporary state of conservation. In practice, however, it seems that only two proposals per country are considered in each cycle.\n\nIn 1992, the program began as a way to preserve and promote documentary heritage, which can be a single document, a collection, a holding or an archival fonds that is deemed to be of such significance as to transcend the boundaries of time and culture. This recorded memory reflects the diversity of languages, people, and cultures. UNESCO, the world agency responsible for the protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage, realized the need to protect such fragile yet important component of cultural heritage. To this end, the Memory of the World Programme was established with the aim of preserving and digitizing humanity's documentary heritage.\n\nThe program is administered by the International Advisory Committee (IAC), whose 14 members are appointed by the UNESCO Director-General. The IAC is responsible for the formulation of major policies, including the technical, legal and financial framework for the program. Regular meetings were held by the IAC in its interim capacity beginning in 1993 to sustain the momentum gained by the program, culminating in the creation of the Memory of the World Register during its second meeting in 1995, with the inaugural batch of documents being inscribed on the Register in 1997, after the statutes that created the IAC as a standing committee took effect.\nThe IAC also maintains several subsidiary bodies:\n\nIAC's biennial meetings are used to discuss and inscribe items onto the Register. The meeting takes place every odd year:\n\nOf the 301 documentary heritage items listed on the Register by 2013, 181, or more than half of the documents, are accounted for by the region encompassing Europe and North America, which includes 39 countries and/or territories.\nFollowing the successful establishment of the Register, UNESCO and the Memory of the World Programme have encouraged the creation of national and regional organizations, presumably in part to streamline applications and fund-raising, as well as national and regional registers, which are to focus on documentary heritage of great regional or national importance, but not necessarily of global importance. In the Asia-Pacific region, in 2014-2015, there were 18 member nations of MOWPAC (6 without national committees), while in 2016, there were 16 national MOW committees. \n\nThe program is not without controversy. During the 2015 cycle, for example, there was a significant degree of conflict within East Asia, as registry with the MOW Program was becoming viewed as an approval of particular views of contested history, specifically with respect to the Nanjing Incident and the comfort women.\n\nThe \"Jikji\" Prize was established in 2004 in cooperation with the South Korean government to further promote the objectives of the Memory of the World Programme, and to commemorate the 2001 inscription of the country's \"Jikji\" on the Register. The award, which includes a cash prize of $30,000 from the Korean government, recognizes institutions that have contributed to the preservation and accessibility of documentary heritage.\n\nThe prize has been awarded biennially since 2005 during the meeting of the IAC.\n\n\n\nA. The Europe and North America region includes the Transcaucasian States of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan, Russian Federation and Turkey. Furthermore, transcontinental documentary heritage like the \"Archives of the Dutch East India Company\", shared among India, Indonesia, Netherlands, South Africa & Sri Lanka, has been classified under this region. The item from Netherlands Antilles is also included in this region, considering its political affiliation with the Netherlands.\n\n"}
{"id": "40049480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40049480", "title": "Nema aviona za Zagreb", "text": "Nema aviona za Zagreb\n\nNema aviona za Zagreb (\"There Is No Plane to Zagreb\") is a 2012 Dutch film by Louis van Gasteren. The film is a retrospective of events in the director's life from 1964 to 1969, filmed by him in that period and reflected on from his vantage point over 40 years later at the age of 90. It is also Jan de Bont's first film credit as cinematographer since 1992's \"Basic Instinct\".\n\nIn 1964 van Gasteren decided to film all his movements, both outward and inner. He narrates early in the film, \"I wanted to make a film about my memories, my observations and experiences. As a filmmaker, I can make that visible.\" Explaining his idea to his wife in the film, he says, \"I want to show everything, because every observation I make fits in with that. Look Jacq, every step I take (he takes a deliberate step forward in the room) – also inwards (points to his chest) – everything I am involved in (gestures at the objects in the room).\"\n\nThe film crisscrosses the globe. Countries the film is shot in include the Netherlands, Switzerland, England, Yugoslavia, France, Canada, West Germany, the United States, India, and Spain. The film mixes documentary with enacted scenes, and is shot in both color and black-and-white. \n\nThe film winds up being a journey of a man in search of truth, seeking to shed lies and illusions, as well as reconcile his relationships with human beings. \n\nAs the film opens, a ninety-year-old Louis van Gasteren—a documentary filmmaker and artist famed in the Netherlands—is seated in a video editing suite, watching scenes of himself in the 1960s, a time when \"anything was possible.\" He reflects on how much he has changed, and that he is that same person and yet is not.\n\nWe then go back to 1964. Van Gasteren is touring a carnival with his second wife, Jacqueline, their baby girl Mardou, and two older children from his first marriage. The family rides the carousel and sees the sights, including a \"Fat Lady\" exhibit of a mother and daughter weighing 900 pounds.\n\nFrom there Louis begins to recall his own youthful memories. His father, Louis van Gasteren, Sr., was a famous actor, and his mother, Elise Menagé Challa, was a singer who gave up the concert stage to promote Communism and traveled rural Spain to learn the songs of the peasants. We learn that his mother died by suicide a few months after his father’s death, and thoughts of his parents are with him every day.\n\nThe film takes a turn of style as Van Gasteren begins to act, playing himself as a good-timer who cheats on his wife with casual encounters. In the course of his travels he runs into an Italian journalist in Belgrade. The two decide to book a flight to Zagreb on a lark, but are told by the travel agent, \"Nema aviona za Zagreb\" (\"There is no plane to Zagreb\" in Serbian). Not knowing the language, they find the expression hilarious, and repeat it wherever they go. But later, when alone, the expression begins to haunt Louis. It becomes a personal catchphrase. \"What \"Nema\" expresses is good will and a great incapacity. \"Nema\" and life as such cannot be tied down. You are in them, yet always off the mark.\" What this means is never entirely clear, but what we see is that from this point forward Louis becomes a sincere seeker of truth.\n\nHe begins to be more critical of his assumptions about life and what he was told in his youth, and conducts a series of experiments to test them. Next he questions what he really sees, how many different angles and dimensions man can perceive, and whether life is simply one big illusion. To answer these questions, he experiments with LSD, which at that time was permitted for therapeutic use. \n\nShortly afterward, it is reported that a young American has died from jumping out a window while tripping on LSD, apparently believing he could fly like a bird. Troubled by this, Louis travels to a U.S. military base in Germany to talk to the boy’s parents, as well as to Millbrook, New York, to meet the LSD-advocate Timothy Leary. In the two skillfully interwoven interviews, a flower-bedecked Leary boasts that people come to his estate to find God through LSD, while the grieving parents puzzle over what went wrong with their son, who had been so healthy and virtuous. These conversations only leave Louis with more questions. He then goes to India to question the spiritual master Meher Baba about LSD and the search for God. \n\nFirst asserting that his own experience of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells us that he stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that had it not been for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did.\n\nFrom the time of these encounters, the style and pace of the film quicken. Interspersed with shots of his enchanting baby daughter as she takes her first steps and grows into childhood, Van Gasteren turns his attention to his art, to meeting artists, intellectuals, and scientists of the ’60s in the United States and Canada, and puts on several exhibits of his own photography and sculpture. He purchases an Opel automobile and has it crushed, then mounted in an Amsterdam park, elevated to an art form. Marshall McLuhan introduces an exhibition of New Style painting in Toronto, broadcast on television. Louis talks to jazz composer Mal Waldron about how his music expresses his protest against the lack of communication in our world. And to the accompaniment of live jazz and slides of his art, Louis recites his own Beat poetry in English.\n\nAt last Louis travels to the Spanish seaside and seems to resolve the loss of his mother by rescuing a man-sized living turtle being sold at market. Together with his children, Louis rows the gasping turtle out into the harbor and releases it back into the sea, to the joy of the whole family. The camera shifts to a café in which a flamenco singer improvises for the family a touching tribute to Mardou, \"a little angel of God.\"\n\nAt the end of the film we see Louis drive down a road and reach a dead end where a mountain of rubble has collapsed into the road. He steps out of the car in silence and faces the mountainous obstacle. It seems to symbolize that he had come to a halting place in the film’s story, or a terminus in that phase of his life. In 1969 Louis stopped making the film.\n\nIn his editing room at ninety years old, Louis van Gasteren at last reveals the heart-breaking event that blocked him from completing the film in the ensuing decades. But now, he says, after more than forty years, he finally found the courage to do it. With this we see him jump from an airplane and descend to earth with a parachute.\n\nThe credits roll over a shot of Louis in the 1960s gazing out the window of a train, where he first began to ponder the word \"nema,\" as \"Really and Sincerely\" by the Bee Gees plays.\n\n\nBegun in 1964 when Van Gasteren was 42 years old, \"Nema aviona za Zagreb\" finally premiered at EYE Film Institute Netherlands on the occasion of Van Gasteren's 90th birthday, 20 November 2012. Louis van Gasteren was present at the opening and afterwards was interviewed by journalist Raymond van den Boogaard. On November 30 there was a public interview with the author by television critic Hans Beerekamp from NRC Handelsblad.\n\nVimeo.com called the film \"a journey in spiritual and geographical terms\" and Realtofilm.nl wrote, \"The film not only gives a peak into a fascinating era, it is a highly original autobiographical portrait.\" Some reviews were negative. Yara Plasman of Filmtotaal.nl described the film as \"a veritable hotch-potch/jumble of various images, sometimes spontaneous while at other times obviously enacted, with or without a clear storyline . . .\"\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Nema\" began in 1964 in the Netherlands and lasted five years as Louis raised money as he went. Filming eventually covered ten countries. Jan de Bont was the cinematographer on the principal scenes of the film, including scenes in New York, Vancouver, San Francisco, Timothy Leary in Millbrook, and Meher Baba in India. Additional cameramen during the very long shooting period included Milek Knebel, Theo Hogers, Roeland Kerbosch, Olof Smit, Bert Spijkerman, Louis van Gasteren, and Kester Dixon (for final filming in 2012).\n\nVan Gasteren worked hard to get an interview with Meher Baba for \"Nema aviona za Zagreb\". In 1967 Meher Baba was near the end of his life and in strict seclusion. Through the help of numerous contacts with people he met in his travels who had met Baba in the 60s, including Irwin Luck, Rick Chapman, and Robert Dreyfuss, Van Gasteren was at last able to reach Baba's secretary and arrange a meeting. Van Gasteren told Baba, \"The appearance of the Avatar in my film is more than functional, it is necessary, to give all the other happenings and sequences the final and right dimension.\" The terms were that the shooting could only take place on September 20, 1967, during a short period when Baba would be coming out of seclusion for three hours in order to wash the feet of seven lepers, the last of such an occasion in Baba's life. Van Gasteren was told that if he was there on time, he could film and interview Baba. Van Gasteren arrived in Bombay on September 17, and at Meherazad at precisely 9:00 A.M. on September 19, accompanied by cameraman Jan de Bont and soundman Peter Brugman, and was shown around the location in preparation for the following day's shoot and met Baba. The following day, September 20, the crew filmed forty minutes of film footage of Baba and the surrounding area, including the interview seen in the film.\n\nFilming stalled in 1969. After two attempts to complete the film in the 70s and 80s, a final attempt to edit the film was begun in 2009 by filmmaker and editor Ilja Lammers who began to gather and assemble the material. The 35mm film was digitized by EYE Film Institute Netherlands in 2010. Completion financing was received from Netherlands Film Fund and EYE Film Institute and the film was finished in 2012, 48 years after principal photography began. The film premiered at EYE on Van Gasteren's 90th birthday. Gasteren was present at the opening.\n\nThe film is in Dutch and English, with small amounts of French, Italian, Serbian, and Spanish. Available with Dutch or English subtitles.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11171113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11171113", "title": "Neo-Zionism", "text": "Neo-Zionism\n\nNeo-Zionism is a right-wing, nationalistic and religious ideology that appeared in Israel following the Six-Day War in 1967 and the capture of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Neo-Zionists consider these lands part of Israel and advocate their settlement by Israeli Jews. Some advocate the transfer of Arabs not only from these areas but also from within the Green Line.\n\nThe term \"Post-Zionism\" entered Israeli discourse following the publishing of a book by Uri Ram in 1993. In the same volume, Gershom Shafir contrasted Post-Zionism with what he termed Neo-Zionism. In a widely cited 1996 essay, sociologist Uri Ram used the term Neo-Zionism to describe a political and religious ideology that developed in Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. He considers it as an \"exclusionary, nationalist, even racist, and antidemocratic political-cultural trend\" in Israel that evolved in parallel with, and in opposition to, the left-wing politics of Post-Zionism and Labor Zionism.\n\nUri Ram contends that Neo-Zionism is not a new phenomenon, instead arguing that it emerged from the Six-Day War in 1967 and the conquest of Jerusalem. Ram contends that Jerusalem is the symbolic capital of Neo-Zionism, while Post-Zionism is orientated around Tel Aviv. It rose with the anxiety following the near loss of the 1973 war.\n\nNeo-Zionists consider \"secular Zionism\", particularly the labor version, as too weak on nationalism and that it never understood the impossibility of Arabs and Jews living together in peace. Neo-Zionists claim that the Arab attitude to Israel is inherently rooted in anti-Semitism and that it is a Zionist illusion to think living in peace and together with them is possible. They consider Arabs in Israel to be a fifth column and to pose a demographic threat to the Jewish majority in Israel. From their point of view, the only solution for achieving peace is through \"deterrence and retaliation\" or preferably \"transfer by agreement\" of the Israeli Arabs and the Palestinian population of the occupied Palestinian Territories to neighboring Arab states.\n\nUri Ram characterizes both Neo-Zionism and Post-Zionism as reactions to the post-nationalist environment. For Neo-Zionism, \"the weakness of Israeli Nationalism derives from his alienation of Jewish sources and culture (...). Only a new national-religious and orthodox coalition [could] cure Zionism of this moral bankruptcy\". Neo-Zionists consider all areas under Israeli military control to be part of \"the biblical Land of Israel\". Neo-Zionists assert that the goal of Jewish statehood is not only about creating a safe refuge for Jews but also about the national-historic destiny of the people of Israel in the land of Israel.\n\nFor Uri Ram, Neo-Zionism is a reinterpretation of Zionism that is religious rather than secular. Judaism, instead of being a peripheral cultural tradition, is a core element in his definition. In Ram's formulation, Post-Zionism is globalist and liberal, while Neo-Zionism is local and ethno-religious. Asima Ghazi-Bouillon challenges Ram's classification of Neo-Zionism as anti-globalist. He instead sees some strains of Neo-Zionism as globalist, similar to Neo-Conservatism and Neo-Nationalism. Whereas Post-Zionism was a largely unsuccessful direct challenge to Zionism, Neo-Zionism is instead a challenge to Labour Zionism. Asima Ghazi-Bouillon argues that Neo-Zionism is not entirely an ethno-religious movement but also incorporates a national security discourse.\n\nIlan Pappé sees four currents which have contributed to Neo-Zionism’s rise: The conversion of the Haredim to Zionism; the settler movement combined with the state funding of Yeshivas; the culturally insular and economically deprived Mizrahi community; and finally the integration of Israel into the global capitalist system.\n\nNeo-Zionism ideology was promoted by the banned Kach and Kahane Chai or the Jewish Defense League.\n\nUri Ram uses the Movement for Greater Israel and the Gush Emunim settler movement founded in 1974 as examples of Neo-Zionism and its precursors, Gush Emunim being a hybrid of religion and nationalism. Ram also labels parts of Likud and the National Religious Party, as well as other, smaller, splinter parties including Yisrael BaAliyah, Moledet, Tehiya and Tzomet as Neo-Zionist.\n\nIn the media Neo-Zionism is associated with Arutz Sheva. According to Yishai Fleisher, Arutz Sheva director of programming and founder of the Kumah neo-Zionist lobby, \"Zionism is the yearning of the Jewish people to come back to the land of Israel with the creation of the Jewish commonwealth and the era of the third Temple. It's a renewal of lost values, and an answer to post-Zionism. If post-Zionism is the theory that Israel was created and the project is now finished, then neo-Zionism states that we are far from done with the project. The Jewish people are not yet back home, and we have yet to educate Jews to the concept of living a Torah life in the land of Israel.\"\n\nSome associations in Israel, such as Im Tirtzu, defend Neo-Zionist ideology. Ronen Shoval, founder of the association states that \"We need every Jewish heart and Zionist soul. Coordinators and activists of Im Tirtzu are hereby called to the flag. (...) [W]e will turn the Hebrew University into a Zionist society, and continue the second Zionist revolution!\" His aims are \"to restore Zionism to the center - for poets to poetize Zionism, for the writers to write Zionism, for academia to support Zionism and for the Ari Folmans (...) to make films about our ethos. Just as there are movies about gladiators, we will have movies about Judah Maccabee. What's wrong with that?\"\n\nAccording to Uri Ram, \"Neo-Zionism (...) is an exclusionary, nationalist, even racist, and antidemocratic political-cultural trend, striving to heighten the fence encasing Israeli identity\"; a point of view also reported by Gilbert Achcar.\n\nAccording to Dana Eyal, \"[her] country is hijacked by a group of racist religious Jews, who are much more of a threat to Israel than any Arab or Muslim country, including Iran\". She gives the example of children of illegal immigrants born and living in Israel for years and that neo-Zionist groups want to see expelled because their presence is un-Zionistic. She thinks that \"[t]his very narrow definition of Zionism dictates that Israel is and will remain a racist Jewish state\" but also \"that in Israel itself there is a (lazy) majority that is far from this. Zionism for us equals patriotism much like it does to Americans; wanting the best for your country, believing in its principals and defending it when necessary. Only we don't believe in many of the neo-orthodox principals popping out like mushrooms in the rain. For that matter, we no longer feel very Zionistic in an environment that embraces totality and purity of race (a calamitous similarity to things that should not be named)\".\n\nPost-Zionists have argued that Israel must choose between a Post-Zionist future and a Neo-Zionist future. Today, Israeli opinion has come to view both \"Post-Zionism\" and \"Neo-Zionism\" as pejorative slogans.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Located in Los Angeles, California, ONE Archives has been a part of the University of Southern California Libraries since 2010. ONE Archives' collections contain over two million items including periodicals; books; film, video and audio recordings; photographs; artworks; ephemera, such as clothing, costumes, and buttons; organizational records; and personal papers. ONE Archives also operates a small gallery and museum space devoted to LGBT art and history in West Hollywood, California. Use of the collections is free during regular business hours.\n\nONE Archives originated from ONE, Inc., which began publishing the earliest national homosexual publication in 1952. In 1956, ONE Inc. created the ONE Institute, an academic institute for the study of homosexuality, utilizing the term \"Homophile Studies.\" In 1994, ONE, Inc. and the International Gay and Lesbian Archives run by Jim Kepner merged. Since 1994 the organization has operated solely as a LGBT archive.\n\nONE Archives' mission statement reads as follows: \"It is the mission of ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries to collect, preserve, and make accessible LGBTQ historical materials while promoting new scholarship on and public awareness of queer histories.\"\n\nONE, Inc. was founded in 1952 to publish the nation's first wide-circulated, national homosexual periodical, \"ONE Magazine\". In 1953, ONE Inc. became the first gay organization to open a public office in Downtown Los Angeles. The original founders include Martin Block, Tony Sanchez (aka Tony Reyes), and Dale Jennings. The corporation's original core members included Martin Block, Tony Reyes, Dale Jennings, Guy Rousseau, Merton Bird, Don Slater, William Lambert (aka W. Dorr Legg), Eve Elloree (aka Joan Corbin), and Ann Carll Reid (aka Irma \"Corky\" Wolf).\n\nIn 1955, ONE Inc. held the ONE Midwinter Institute, the first in a series of conferences to bring together experts and community members to talk about gay and lesbian topics.\n\nIn 1956, ONE Inc. created the ONE Institute, an academic institute for the study of homosexuality under the name of \"Homophile Studies\".\n\nIn 1957, marking the first time the United States Supreme Court explicitly ruled on homosexuality, ONE Inc. fought to distribute its magazine by mail, and prevailed. The ruling in the case, \"One, Inc. v. Olesen\", not only allowed ONE to distribute its magazine, but also paved the way for other controversial publications to be sent through the U.S. mail.\n\nAlso during the 1950s ONE Inc. became an ad hoc community center and began a library. Jim Kepner was involved in adding material to this library.\n\nAs the burgeoning Gay Liberation movement took off and became more closely intertwined with the movements for civil rights of the 1960s and 1970s, ONE Inc., Jim Kepner and a growing group of activists were poised to collect original materials from that critical time period. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, ONE obtained crucial documents chronicling the establishment of the \"gay community\" and its established and increasingly diverse groups and organizations.\n\nSince the 1980s, the archival collections have grown substantially as gay issues and gay culture became more integrated into the mainstream culture of the United States.\n\nIn October 2012 ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives celebrated the 60th anniversary of its founding and the printing of \"ONE Magazine\".\n\nThe institutional history of ONE reveals a set of complex, overlapping and groundbreaking activities that provided a wide variety of pioneering services to LGBT Americans:\n\nThe collections at ONE Archives are primarily national in scope, with special focus on LGBT histories in the Los Angeles region. The archives also include a number of international materials, such as archival records and rare publications.\n\nONE houses over 600 archival collections of personal papers from activists, artists and ordinary citizens, as well as records from LGBTQ political, social, educational and cultural organizations. The collections include a wide array of materials such as manuscripts, photographs, letters, graphics, and other historically significant materials.\n\nImportant archival collections of note include:\n\nONE's main library collection comprises over 30,000 volumes of books and monographs; as well as over 8,000 titles of periodicals, such as magazines, newspapers and newsletters. From issues of the earliest American LGBT publications to the most recent LGBT titles, the collection includes many rare and unusual titles, some of which may be the only copies in existence. The library also includes foreign publications in more than 25 different languages.\n\nONE's collection of audiovisual materials includes over 4,000 films, 14,000 videos (including 10 years of recorded lectures from ONE, Inc.), and 3,000 audio recordings. Many of ONE's films and videos are stored and preserved in conjunction with the Outfest Legacy Project at the UCLA Film and Television Archive.\n\nONE Archives' art collection include over 4,000 paintings, drawings, works on paper, photographs, and sculptural objects, the majority of which date from the 1940s to the present.\n\nONE Archives also collects and houses over 3,500 posters; textiles, such as T-shirts, banners and flags; and memorabilia such as buttons, matchbooks, dolls and other three-dimensional objects.\n\nSince 2008, ONE Archives has operated an exhibition space in West Hollywood, California dedicated to presenting temporary exhibitions on LGBT art and history. The gallery is located in a city owned building that also houses the June L. Mazer Lesbian Archives.\n\nIn 2011, ONE Archives participated in the region-wide initiative with the exhibition \"Cruising the Archive: Queer Art & Culture in Los Angeles, 1945-1980\" which was presented at the ONE Gallery in West Hollywood, as well as at ONE Archives' main location on West Adams Boulevard and in the Treasure Room at the Doheny Memorial Library at the University of Southern California Libraries. The exhibition included works by Steven F. Arnold, Don Bachardy, Claire Falkenstein, Anthony Friedkin, Rudi Gernreich, Sister Corita Kent, and Kate Millett, among many other less known or anonymous artists. The only exhibition dedicated to queer content within the PST initiative, this exhibition marked the most comprehensive exhibition of materials from the collections at ONE Archives to date and was accompanied by a scholarly catalogue. The publication included contributions by Ann Cvetkovich, Vaginal Davis, Jennifer Doyle, Jack Halberstam, Catherine Lord, Richard Meyer, Ulrike Müller, and Dean Spade.\n\nThe ONE Gallery has presented solo exhibitions of artwork by Steven F. Arnold and Joey Terrill, exhibitions of historical materials from the collections at ONE, and highlights from the collections of the Tom of Finland Foundation and the Center for the Study of Political Graphics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "931158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=931158", "title": "Power projection", "text": "Power projection\n\nPower projection (or force projection) is a term used in military and political science to refer to the capacity of a state \"to apply all or some of its elements of national power — political, economic, informational, or military — to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to deterrence, and to enhance regional stability.\"\n\nThis ability is a crucial element of a state's power in international relations. Any state able to direct its military forces outside the limited bounds of its territory might be said to have \"some\" level of power projection capability, but the term itself is used most frequently in reference to militaries with a worldwide reach (or at least significantly broader than a state's immediate area). Even states with sizable hard power assets (such as a large standing army) may only be able to exert limited regional influence so long as they lack the means of effectively projecting their power on a global scale. Generally, only a select few states are able to overcome the logistical difficulties inherent in the deployment and direction of a modern, mechanized military force.\n\nWhile traditional measures of power projection typically focus on hard power assets (tanks, soldiers, aircraft, naval vessels, etc.), the developing theory of soft power notes that power projection does not necessarily have to involve the active use of military forces in combat. Assets for power projection can often serve dual uses, as the deployment of various countries' militaries during the humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake illustrates. The ability of a state to project its forces into an area may serve as an effective diplomatic lever, influencing the decision-making process and acting as a potential deterrent on other states' behavior.\n\nEarly examples of power projection includes Roman dominance of Europe: the ability to project power is tied to the ability to innovate and field such innovations. Roman engineering innovations such as machines (pile driver), concrete, aqueducts and modern roads provided the footing for an economic engine that powered a military that was unmatched in its day. Examples of Roman power projection include Julius Caesar building the Rhine bridge in 10 days to demonstrate the ability to march its 40000 troops as it sees fit: the local inhabitants enjoyed the natural protection of the river and fled when this natural protection was overcome. Although Rome is far from the center of modern-power, its influence can be seen in the architecture of modern capitols around the world (domes, arches, columns). The demonstration of an extraordinary innovative military capability will signal power and when properly applied terminate conflicts summarily.\n\nDuring the Ming treasure voyages in the 15th century, the Chinese treasure fleet was heavily militarized to exercise power projection around the Indian Ocean and thereby promote its interests. \n\nThe modern ability to project power and exert influence on a global scale can be tied to innovations stemming from the Industrial Revolution and the associated modernizations in technology, communications, finance and bureaucracy; this finally allowed the state to create unprecedented amounts of wealth and to effectively marshal these resources to exert power over long distances.\n\nThe first such industrial-technological power was the British Empire in the 19th century. As a maritime power, its strength and ability to project power to further its interests lay in the Royal Navy. A worldwide system of naval bases and coaling stations, a large logistical bureaucracy to oversee shipbuilding, the supply of coal, food, water, and sailors, and an industrial base for the manufacture and technological enhancement of the fleet were among the essential ingredients for this capability. During the First Opium War (1839–42), it was this capacity that enabled a British expeditionary force of 15 barracks ships, 4 steam-powered gunboats and 25 smaller boats with 4,000 marines to successfully defend its interests 6,000 miles from the fleet's home port. The era of gunboat diplomacy that this inaugurated was an exercise in Western power projection, and was normally used in the defence of commercial and political interests.\nThe Anglo-French expeditionary force sent to shore up the Ottoman Empire against Russian aggression during the Crimean War (1853–56) was one of the first examples of a planned expeditionary power-projection campaign. It was the first campaign to use modern technology, including steam-powered warships and telegraph communications.\n\nAnother illustrative example of industrial power projection, was the punitive British Expedition to Abyssinia in 1868 as a retaliation against Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia's imprisonment of several missionaries and British government representatives. The expeditionary force sent was a tremendous logistical and technological challenge at the time. Commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Napier of the Bombay Army, military intelligence was used to estimate the required size of the army and the difficulties of traversing the inhospitable terrain.\n\nA force of over 30,000 was shipped from British India to Zula on the Red Sea on a fleet of more than 280 steam ships, while an advance detachment of engineers built a large port with two piers, warehouses and a lighthouse, and constructed a 20-mile-long railway towards the interior. A road was also built for the artillery to be moved along with the help of elephants. After three months of trekking, the British force repelled an Ethiopian attack and bombarded the fortress of Magdala into submission; Tewodros committed suicide.\n\nIn the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, the Japanese destruction of the Imperial Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet demonstrated Imperial Russia's inability to project force in the East. This immediately diminished Russia's diplomatic sway in that region. At the same time, Russia's western armies became less credible, as mobilization exposed organizational flaws and threw the western armies into chaos. This led analysts in Europe, such as German chief of staff Count Alfred von Schlieffen, to conclude that Russia would prove inept at projecting force in Europe, thus demoting Russia in European diplomatic relations.\n\nMany other actions can be considered projections of force. The 19th century is full of incidents such as the 1864 Bombardment of Kagoshima and the Boxer Rebellion. More recently, the Falklands War provided an example of the United Kingdom's ability to project force far from home. Other recent examples of power projection include the U.S.-led Invasion of Iraq and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The ability of the U.S. Navy, the British Royal Navy, and the French Navy to deploy large numbers of ships for long periods of time away from home are notable projection abilities.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense defines power projection as the \"ability of a nation to apply all or some of its elements of national power—political, economic, informational, or military—to rapidly and effectively deploy and sustain forces in and from multiple dispersed locations to respond to crises, to contribute to deterrence, and to enhance regional stability\".\n\nAs distance between a fighting force and its headquarters increases, command and control inevitably becomes more difficult. Modern-day power projection often employs high-tech communications and information technology to overcome these difficulties, a process sometimes described as the \"Revolution in Military Affairs\".\n\nWhile a few long-range weapons such as the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) are capable of projecting deadly force in their own right, it is military logistics that is at the heart of power projection. The ability to integrate naval and air forces with land armies as part of joint warfare is a key aspect of effective power projection; airlift and sealift capabilities facilitate the deployment of soldiers and weapons to a distant theater of war.\n\nThe aircraft carrier strike group, strategic bomber, ballistic missile submarine, and strategic airlifter are all examples of power projection platforms. Military units designed to be light and mobile, such as airborne forces (paratroopers and air assault forces) and amphibious assault forces, are utilized in power projection. Forward basing is another method of power projection, which, by pre-positioning military units or stockpiles of arms at strategically located military bases outside a country's territory, reduces the time and distance needed to mobilize them.\n\nScholars have disaggregated military power projection into nine different categories based on political goals and level of force. Four of these employ \"soft\" military power (securing sea lanes of communication, non-combatant evacuation, humanitarian response, and peacekeeping) and the rest are primarily concerned with \"hard\" military power (show the flag, compellence/deterrence, punishment, armed intervention, and conquest).\n\nExamples of soft power projection include:\n\n\nExamples of hard power projection include:\n\n\n\n"}

The manifesto was published on 14 November 1944.\n\nThe Manifesto opened with a preamble that strongly criticized Stalin for crimes against the people of the USSR, including genocide via repression and engineered famines, and suppression of personal freedoms. However, the same preamble also accused the Allies, referred to in the text as \"the plutocracies of the United States and England\", of collaborating with Stalin in trying to conquer, rather than liberate, Europe.\n\nThe authors later justified some of the more objectionable parts of the Manifesto by claiming that they had been included to appease the Nazi propagandists. Although anti-Allied sentiment was included, the authors refused to include antisemitic rhetoric, despite heavy pressure from the Nazi propaganda department.\n\nGeneral Andrey Vlasov, the chair of the KONR and the commander of the Russian Liberation Army, had criticised the extermination of the Jews to German commanders (as noted in Wilfried Strik-Strikfeldt's memoirs, \"Against Stalin and Hitler\"), and had several close collaborators who were Jewish, including his speech writer Mileti Zikov, Captain Boyarskiy, and General Boris Shteifon of the Russian Corps. Interviewed by a neutral journalist about his views on the \"Jewish problem\", Georgii Malenkov, General of the Russian Liberation Army and KONR committee member, remarked that \"we do not feel that Russia has any Jewish problem that needs to be addressed\".\n\nThe Manifesto focused on uniting not only ethnic Russians but all the nationalities inhabiting the Soviet Union, such as Ukrainians, Belarusians, Balts, Kalmyks, Armenians, Georgians, Circassians, and others. Many representatives from these nationalities were a part of the Committee and signed the Manifesto.\n\nA central part of the Manifesto is the 14 points upon which a new democratic Russia would be built. These points guaranteed the freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly, conscience, equal rights for women and all peoples of Russia (and the rights of the latter for self determination) – in other words, many of the same rights that were already guaranteed by the text of the existing Soviet Constitution, but routinely disregarded by Stalin's government. Unlike the Soviet Constitution, however, the Prague Manifesto was anti-communist, calling for the abolition of collective farms, among other things. Many aspects of the Manifesto closely resemble the political program of the Russian emigré organisation, the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists (NTS), of whom several of Vlasov's key allies were members, such as General Feodor Trukhin.\n\nThe Manifesto specified that an \"honorable peace\" with Germany \"not disturbing the honor\" of Russia would be achieved. It also stated that the help of Germany was welcome as it provided \"the only realistic possibility\" of removing Stalin from power.\n\nGeneral Vlasov proclaimed the Prague Manifesto on 14 November 1944, at the Prague Castle. The city was chosen because all major Russian cities at this point were already under Soviet control, and Prague was a Slavic city. Six months later the first division of the Russian Liberation Army participated in the liberation of Prague from the Nazi occupying forces in co-operation with Czech partisans.\n\nThe fourteen points, excerpted from the manifesto:\n\n\"As the basis for a new government for the peoples of Russia the committee set down the following major principles:\n\n\nThe manifesto and the committee were criticised for having being created under the sponsorship of the Nazi regime. Critics argue that collaboration with this regime automatically discredits the movement's goals and aspirations. Defenders of the manifesto claim that the sponsorship of the Nazi government was accepted reluctantly, but was necessary as the movement could not be sustained in the conditions that were prevalent at the time. General Vlasov said during a speech to Eastern Workers that \"the assistance of Germany is the only realistic option for us to succeed\", while support from democratic regimes was impossible as they were collaborating with Stalin at the time.\n\n"}

{"id": "1362816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1362816", "title": "Records management", "text": "Records management\n\nRecords management, also known as records and information management, is an organizational function devoted to the management of information in an organization throughout its life cycle, from the time of creation or inscription to its eventual disposition. This includes identifying, classifying, storing, securing, retrieving, tracking and destroying or permanently preserving records. The ISO 15489-1: 2001 standard (\"ISO 15489-1:2001\") defines \"records management\" as \"[the] field of management responsible for the efficient and systematic control of the creation, receipt, maintenance, use and disposition of records, including the processes for capturing and maintaining evidence of and information about business activities and transactions in the form of records\".\n\nAn organization's records preserve aspects of institutional memory. In determining how long to retain records, their capacity for re-use is important. Many are kept as evidence of activities, transactions, and decisions. Others document what happened and why. The purpose of records management is part of an organization's broader function of Governance, risk management, and compliance and is primarily concerned with managing the evidence of an organization's activities as well as the reduction or mitigation of risk associated with it.\n\nThe concept of record is variously defined. The ISO 15489-1:2016 defines \"records\" as \"information created, received, and maintained as evidence and as an asset by an organization or person, in pursuit of legal obligations or in the transaction of business\". While there are many purposes of and benefits to records management, as both these definitions highlight, a key feature of records is their ability to serve as evidence of an event. Proper records management can help preserve this feature of records.\n\nRecent and comprehensive studies have defined records as \"persistent representations of activities\" as recorded or created by participants or observers. This transactional view emphasizes the importance of context and process in the determination and meaning of records. In contrast, previous definitions have emphasized the evidential and informational properties of records. In organizational contexts, records are materials created or received by an organization in the transaction of business, or in pursuit of or in compliance with legal obligations. This organizational definition of record stems from the early theorization of archives as organic aggregations of records, that is \"the written documents, drawings and printed matter, officially received or produced by an administrative body or one of its officials\".\n\nNot all documents are records. A \"record\" is a document consciously retained as evidence of an action. Records management systems generally distinguish between records and non-records (convenience copies, rough drafts, duplicates), which do not need formal management. Many systems, especially for electronic records, require documents to be formally \"declared as a record\" so they can be managed. Once declared, a record cannot be changed and can only be disposed of within the rules of the system.\n\nRecords may be covered by \"access controls\" to regulate who can access them and under what circumstances. Physical controls may be used to keep confidential records secure – personnel files, for instance, which hold sensitive personal data, may be held in a locked cabinet with a control log to track access. Digital records systems may include role-based access controls, allowing permissions (to view, change and/or delete) to be allocated to staff depending on their role in the organisation. An \"audit trail\" showing all access and changes can be maintained to ensure the integrity of the records.\n\nJust as the records of the organization come in a variety of formats, the storage of records can vary throughout the organization. File maintenance may be carried out by the owner, designee, a records repository, or clerk. Records may be managed in a centralized location, such as a records center or repository, or the control of records may be decentralized across various departments and locations within the entity. Records may be formally and discretely identified by coding and housed in folders specifically designed for optimum protection and storage capacity, or they may be casually identified and filed with no apparent indexing. Organizations that manage records casually find it difficult to access and retrieve information when needed. The inefficiency of filing maintenance and storage systems can prove to be costly in terms of wasted space and resources expended searching for records.\n\nAn \"inactive record\" is a record that is no longer needed to conduct current business but is being preserved until it meets the end of its retention period, such as when a project ends, a product line is retired, or the end of a fiscal reporting period is reached. These records may hold business, legal, fiscal, or historical value for the entity in the future and, therefore, are required to be maintained for a short or permanent duration. Records are managed according to the retention schedule. Once the life of a record has been satisfied according to its predetermined period and there are no legal holds pending, it is authorized for final disposition, which may include destruction, transfer, or permanent preservation.\n\nA \"disaster recovery plan\" is a written and approved course of action to take after a disaster strikes that details how an organization will restore critical business functions and reclaim damaged or threatened records.\n\nAn \"active record\" is a record needed to perform current operations, subject to frequent use, and usually located near the user. In the past, 'records management' was sometimes used to refer only to the management of records which were no longer in everyday use but still needed to be kept – 'semi-current' or 'inactive' records, often stored in basements or offsite. More modern usage tends to refer to the entire 'lifecycle' of records – from the point of creation right through until their eventual disposal.\n\nThe format and media of records is generally irrelevant for the purposes of records management from the perspective that records must be identified and managed, regardless of their form. The ISO considers management of both physical and electronic records. Also, section DL1.105 of the United States Department of Defense standard DoD 5015.02-STD (2007) defines Records Management as \"the planning, controlling, directing, organizing, training, promoting, and other managerial activities involving the life cycle of information, including creation, maintenance (use, storage, retrieval), and disposal, regardless of media.\"\n\nThe records life-cycle consists of discrete phases covering the life span of a record from its creation to its final disposition. In the creation phase, records growth is expounded by modern electronic systems. Records will continue to be created and captured by the organization at an explosive rate as it conducts the business of the organization. Correspondence regarding a product failure is written for internal leadership, financial statements and reports are generated for public and regulatory scrutiny, the old corporate logo is retired, and a new one – including color scheme and approved corporate font – takes its place in the organization's history.\n\nExamples of records phases include those for \"creation\" of a record, \"modification\" of a record, \"movement\" of a record through its different states while in existence, and \"destruction\" of a record.\n\nThroughout the records life cycle, issues such as security, privacy, disaster recovery, emerging technologies, and mergers are addressed by the records and information management professional responsible for organizational programs. Records and information management professionals are instrumental in controlling and safeguarding the information assets of the entity. They understand how to manage the creation, access, distribution, storage, and disposition of records and information in an efficient and cost-effective manner using records and information management methodology, principles, and best practices in compliance with records and information laws and regulations.\n\nThe records continuum theory is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities in relation to multiple contexts over space and time.\n\nA Records Manager is someone who is responsible for records management in an organization.\n\nSection 4 of the ISO 15489-1:2001 states that records management includes:\n\n\nThus, the practice of records management may involve:\n\n\nRecords-management principles and automated records-management systems aid in the capture, classification, and ongoing management of records throughout their lifecycle. Such a system may be paper-based (such as index cards as used in a library), or may involve a computer system, such as an electronic records-management application.\n\nA \"defensible solution\" is one that can be supported with clearly documented policies, processes and procedures that drive how and why work is performed, as well as one that has clearly documented proof of behavior patterns, proving that an organization follows such documented constraints to the best of their ability.\n\nWhile \"defensibility\" applies to all aspects of records life cycle, it is considered most important in the context of records destruction, where it is known as \"\"defensible disposition\" or \"defensible destruction\",\" and helps an organization explicitly justify and prove things like who destroys records, why they destroy them, how they destroy them, when they destroy them, and where they destroy them.\n\nRecords managers use classification or categorization of record types as a means of working with records. Such classifications assist in functions such as creation, organization, storage, retrieval, movement, and destruction of records.\n\nAt the highest level of classification are physical versus electronic records. (This is disputable; records are defined as such regardless of media. ISO 15489 and other best practices promulgate a functions based, rather than media based classification, because the law defines records as certain kinds of information regardless of media.)\n\nPhysical records are those records, such as paper, that can be touched and which take up physical space.\n\nElectronic records, also often referred to as digital records, are those records that are generated with and used by information technology devices.\n\nClassification of records is achieved through the design, maintenance, and application of taxonomies, which allow records managers to perform functions such as the categorization, tagging, segmenting, or grouping of records according to various traits.\n\n\"Enterprise records\" represent those records that are common to most enterprises, regardless of their function, purpose, or sector. Such records often revolve around the day-to-day operations of an enterprise and cover areas such as but not limited litigation, employee management, consultant or contractor management, customer engagements, purchases, sales, and contracts.\n\nThe types of enterprises that produce and work with such records include but are not limited to for-profit companies, non-profit companies, and government agencies.\n\n\"Industry records\" represent those records that are common and apply only to a specific industry or set of industries. Examples include but are not limited to medical industry records (e.g., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), pharmaceutical industry records, and food industry records.\n\n\"Legal hold\" records are those records that are mandated, usually by legal counsel or compliance personnel, to be held for a period of time, either by a government or by an enterprise, and for the purposes of addressing potential issues associated with compliance audits and litigation. Such records are assigned \"Legal Hold\" traits that are in addition to classifications which are as a result of enterprise or industry classifications.\n\nLegal hold data traits may include but are not limited to things such as legal hold flags (e.g. Legal Hold = True or False), the organization driving the legal hold, descriptions of why records must be legally held, what period of time records must be held for, and the hold location.\n\nA records retention schedule is a document, often developed using Archival appraisal concepts and analysis of business and legal contexts within the intended jurisdictions, that outlines how long certain types of records need to be retained for before they can be destroyed. \n\nManaging physical records involves different disciplines or capabilities and may draw on a variety of forms of expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercially available products can manage records through all processes active, inactive, archival, retention scheduling and disposal. Some also utilize RFID technology for the tracking of the physical file.\n\nThe general principles of records management apply to records in any format. Digital records, however, raise specific issues. It is more difficult to ensure that the content, context and structure of records is preserved and protected when the records do not have a physical existence. This has important implications for the authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness of records.\n\nMuch research is being conducted on the management of digital records. The International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems (InterPARES) Project is one example of such an initiative. Based at the School of Library, Archival and Information Studies at the University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the InterPARES Project is a collaborative project between researchers all across the world committed to developing theories and methodologies to ensure the reliability, accuracy, and authenticity of digital records.\n\nFunctional requirements for computer systems to manage digital records have been produced by the US Department of Defense, The United Kingdom's National Archives and the European Commission, whose MoReq (Model Requirements for the Management of Electronic Records) specification has been translated into at least twelve languages funded by the European Commission.\n\nParticular concerns exist about the ability to access and read digital records over time, since the rapid pace of change in technology can make the software used to create the records obsolete, leaving the records unreadable. A considerable amount of research is being undertaken to address this, under the heading of digital preservation. The Public Record Office Victoria (PROV) located in Melbourne, Australia published the Victorian Electronic Records Strategy (VERS) which includes a standard for the preservation, long-term storage and access to permanent electronic records. The VERS standard has been adopted by all Victorian Government departments. A digital archive has been established by PROV to enable the general public to access permanent records. Archives New Zealand is also setting up a digital archive.\n\nElectronic Tax Records are computer-based/non-paper versions of records required by tax agencies like the Internal Revenue Service. There is substantial confusion about what constitutes acceptable digital records for the IRS, as the concept is relatively new. The subject is discussed in Publication 583 and Bulletin 1997-13, but not in specific detail.\n\nBusinesses and individuals wishing to convert their paper records into scanned copies may be at risk if they do so. For example, it is unclear if an IRS auditor would accept a JPEG, PNG, or PDF format scanned copy of a purchase receipt for a deducted expense item.\n\nWhile public administration, healthcare and the legal profession have a long history of records management, the corporate sector has generally shown less interest. This has changed in recent years due to new compliance requirements, driven in part by scandals such as the Enron/Andersen affair and more recent problems at Morgan Stanley. Corporate records compliance issues including retention period requirements and the need to disclose information as a result of litigation have come to be seen as important. Statutes such as the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act have resulted in greater standardization of records management practices. Since the 1990s the shift towards electronic records has seen a need for close working relations between records managers and IT managers, particularly including the legal aspects, focused on compliance and risk management.\n\nPrivacy, data protection, and identity theft have become issues of increasing interest. The role of the records manager in the protection of an organization's records has grown as a result. The need to ensure personal information is not retained unnecessarily has brought greater focus to retention schedules and records disposal.\n\nThe increased importance of transparency and accountability in public administration, marked by the widespread adoption of Freedom of Information laws, has led to a focus on the need to manage records so that they can be easily accessed by the public. For instance, in the United Kingdom, Section 46 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 required the government to publish a Code of Practice on Records Management for public authorities. Similarly, European Union legislation on Data Protection and Environmental Information, requiring organisations to disclose information on request, create a need for effective management of such records.\n\nImplementing required changes to organisational culture is a major challenge, since records management is often seen as an unnecessary or low priority administrative task that can be performed at the lowest levels within an organization. Reputational damage caused by poor records management has demonstrated that records management is the responsibility of all individuals within an organization.\n\nAn issue that has been very controversial among records managers has been the uncritical adoption of Electronic document and records management systems.\n\nAnother issue of great interest to records managers is the impact of the internet and related social media, such as wikis, blogs, forums, and companies such as Facebook and Twitter, on traditional records management practices, principles, and concepts, since many of these tools allow rapid creation and dissemination of records and, often, even in anonymous form.\n\nA difficult challenge for many enterprises is tied to the tracking of records through their entire information life cycle so that it's clear, at all times, where a record exists or if it still exists at all. The tracking of records through their life cycles allows records management staff to understand when and how to apply records related rules, such as rules for legal hold or destruction.\n\nAs the world becomes more digital in nature, an ever-growing issue for the records management community is the conversion of existing or incoming paper records to electronic form. Such conversions are most often performed with the intent of saving storage costs, storage space, and in hopes of reducing records retrieval time.\n\nTools such as document scanners, optical character recognition software, and electronic document management systems are used to facilitate such conversions.\n\nMany colleges and universities offer degree programs in library and information sciences which cover records management. Furthermore, there are professional organizations such as the Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia (RIMPA) and the Institute of Certified Records Managers which provides a separate, non-degreed, professional certification for practitioners, the Certified Records Manager designation or CRM. Additional educational opportunities in the form of a certificate program are also available from AIIM International, ARMA International, and from the Information and Records Management Society in Great Britain and Ireland. Education and training courses and workshops on scientific and technical records full life-cycle management and the Quality Electronic Records Practices Standards (Q-ERPS) are available from the Collaborative Electronic Notebook Systems Association.\n\nThe University of South Australia offers a Graduate Certificate, a graduate diploma, and an MSc in Business Information Management and Library and Information Management with a specialist stream in records management. The Australian National University offer a six-week e-learning course worldwide, in Electronic Document and Records Management. In addition, Columbia University offers its Masters of Science in Information & Digital Resource Management (IDRM).\n\nSchools in Canada also provide specialized education opportunities in records management. The Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto allows students in the Master of Information program to concentrate their studies in Archives and Records Management. The School of Information Studies at McGill University also includes an Archival Management stream that is enriched in records management coursework. The University of British Columbia offers a Masters of Archival Studies including a concentration in Records Management.\n\nAn Electronic Document and Records Management System is a computer program or set of programs used to track and store records. The term is distinguished from imaging and document management systems that specialize in paper capture and document management respectively. Electronic records management Systems commonly provide specialized security and auditing functionality tailored to the needs of records managers.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has endorsed the U.S. Department of Defense standard 5015.2 as an \"adequate and appropriate basis for addressing the basic challenges of managing records in the automated environment that increasingly characterizes the creation and use of records.\" Records Management Vendors can be certified as compliant with the DoD 5015.2-STD after verification from the Joint Interoperability Test Command which builds test case procedures, writes detailed and summary final reports on 5015.2-certified products, and performs on-site inspection of software.\n\nThe National Archives in the UK has published two sets of functional requirements to promote the development of the electronic records management software market (1999 and 2002). It ran a program to evaluate products against the 2002 requirements. While these requirements were initially formulated in collaboration with central government, they have been taken up with enthusiasm by many parts of the wider public sector in the UK and in other parts of the world. The testing program has now closed; The National Archives is no longer accepting applications for testing. The National Archives 2002 requirements remain current.\n\nThe European Commission has published \"MoReq\", the Model Requirements for Electronic Records and Document Management in 2001. Although not a formal standard, it is widely regarded and referred to as a standard. This was funded by the Commission's IDA program, and was developed at the instigation of the DLM Forum. A major update of MoReq, known as MoReq2, was published in February 2008. This too was initiated by the DLM Forum and funded by the European Commission, on this occasion by its IDABC program (the successor to IDA). A software testing framework and an XML schema accompany MoReq2; a software compliance testing regime was agreed at the DLM Forum conference in Toulouse in December 2008.\n\nThe National Archives of Australia (NAA) published the Functional Specifications for Electronic Records Management Systems Software (ERMS), and the associated Guidelines for Implementing the Functional Specifications for Electronic Records Management Systems Software, as exposure drafts in February 2006.\n\nArchives New Zealand published a 'discretionary best practice' Electronic Recordkeeping Systems Standard (Standard 5) in June 2005, issued under the authority of Section 27 of the Public Records Act 2005.\n\nCommercial records centers are facilities which provide services for the storage for paper records for organizations. In some cases, they also offer storage for records maintained in electronic formats. Commercial records centers provide high density storage for paper records and some offer climate controlled storage for sensitive non-paper and critical (vital) paper media. There is a trade organization for commercial records centers (for example, PRISM International), however, not all service providers are members.\n\n\n"}

Monks\n\nSarah Preston Monks (1841–1926) was an American naturalist, educator, scientific illustrator, and poet, based for much of her career in San Pedro, California. She was the first zoology instructor at Los Angeles State Normal School, a precursor to the University of California, Los Angeles, where she taught for over 20 years, and published on diverse topics including reptiles, amphibians, spiders, and marine biology.\n\nSarah Preston Monks was born in Cold Spring, New York, the daughter of John Monks and Sarah Charlotte Monks (née Jolly). Her brother John A. S. Monks became a noted New England artist and her sister Mary E. Monks lived in Massachusetts. She studied at Vassar College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1871 and a master's degree in 1876. She read one of her own poems, \"Waiting for the Tide\", at Vassar's 1871 graduation ceremony. She pursued further technical training at the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile still in Philadelphia, she worked at the Academy of Natural Sciences, classifying ornithological specimens. She later moved to California, where she taught for one year at the College of Santa Barbara before joining the faculty of the Los Angeles State Normal School in 1884 where she became the school's first instructor of zoology. She taught zoology, chemistry and drawing at the Normal School until her retirement in 1906 and was curator of the school's museum. She also lectured on entomology and microscopy at the school's Teachers' Institutes (continuing education programs for teachers in Southern California). Meanwhile, she worked on research projects in her own time, and in collaboration with the William Emerson Ritter's laboratory on Terminal Island. She collected specimens and published scientific and popular articles on turtles, lizards, salamanders, spiders, shipworms, and diatoms. She also published poetry.

The website features regularly updated, original content from the museum's research, collections, and Sant Ocean Hall as well as content provided by a number of collaborating organizations.\nAccording to the site's statement of purpose, the Ocean Portal was created to \"help increase public knowledge about the ocean and marine science, raise public awareness of the ocean's importance to all life, and inspire millions of online visitors to become caring ocean stewards.\" Supported by private donations, the Ocean Portal is designed to appeal to a broad audience, but the primary audiences are young adults, ocean enthusiasts, educators, and children ages 9–13.\n\nThe Ocean Portal represents the third pillar of the National Museum of Natural History's Ocean Initiative, created to further the museum's mission to increase ocean awareness and stewardship. The other pillars of the initiative include the Sant Ocean Hall, the museum's largest exhibition to date, and the Sant Chair for Marine Science, currently filled by marine biologist Dr. Nancy Knowlton. The National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) cares for an estimated 126 million specimens, approximately 94% of all Smithsonian collections. About one-third of NMNH collections and staff focus on the marine realm. NMNH houses the world's largest marine collection, originating from marine research efforts that date back 160 years.\n\nIn a first for any Smithsonian Institution website, the Smithsonian Ocean Portal is built on a LAMP architecture using the free, open-source software called Drupal. The New York-based web developer Funny Garbage designed and built the Smithsonian Ocean Portal. The Beta version of the website went live in December 2009. Three months later, in March 2010, the National Museum of Natural History launched \"What Does It Mean to Be Human?\", its second Drupal website and the online companion to the David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins.\nFor several months in early 2010 the Ocean Portal site was tested among specific audiences while development continued. The Beta site launched to the broader public on June 2, 2010 as part of the celebration of World Oceans Day on June 8.\n\n\nThe Portal is divided into several sections, including \"Ocean Life and Ecosystems,\" \"Ocean Science,\" \"Ocean Over Time,\" and \"Photo Essays.\" Popular topic areas include the Ocean Portal Blog, the Great White Shark, the Giant Squid, Deep Ocean Exploration, Top Predators Over Time, Coral Reefs, and the Gulf Oil Spill. Users are encouraged to comment on and rate pages, and also encouraged to provide feedback via survey forms and email. Users are also encouraged to join/follow the Ocean Portal on Facebook and Twitter. In addition, the Ocean Portal has several special sections, such as:\n\nThe \"For Educators\" section offers classroom activities, lessons, and educational resources that are teacher-tested and correlate with the Ocean Literacy Principles developed in accordance with National Science Education Standards. The educator materials represent some of the best resources available by subject from the Ocean Portal's collaborators. The materials are available in the Educators' section, but also integrated throughout the site on species, ecosystem, and other subject pages. The educational materials can be filtered by grade, subject, and topic.\n\nThe Ocean & You section examines the impact of human activities and choices on the global ocean system. It features content on subjects like the Gulf Oil Spill, Climate Change, and Sustainable Seafood. Discussions of human impacts are also integrated throughout the site on pages dedicated to specific species and ecosystems, such as Mangroves, Coral Reefs, and the Great White Shark.\n\nThis section offers specific actions that people can take to have a positive impact on the global ocean system, including \"Featured Actions\" such as Be Kind to the Beach, Stop Slow Oil Leaks, and Steer Clear of Coral Souvenirs.

{"id": "690793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=690793", "title": "Terry Funk", "text": "Terry Funk\n\nTerrence Funk (born June 30, 1944) is an American semi-retired professional wrestler and actor. Funk is known for the longevity of his career – which has spanned more than 50 years and includes multiple short-lived retirements – and the influential hardcore wrestling style he pioneered in the latter part of his career.\n\nOver the course of his career, Funk has wrestled for numerous major promotions, among them All Japan Pro Wrestling, Extreme Championship Wrestling, the International Wrestling Association of Japan, Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, the United States Wrestling Association, World Championship Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation and multiple National Wrestling Alliance territories including Big Time Wrestling, Championship Wrestling from Florida, Georgia Championship Wrestling and Stampede Wrestling. He was the promoter of the Amarillo, Texas-based Western States Sports promotion.\n\nChampionships held by Funk include the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, NWA World Heavyweight Championship, USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship, WWF World Tag Team Championship, and ECW World Television Championship. He headlined ECW's premier annual pay-per-view event, November to Remember, three times. Funk has been inducted into multiple halls of fame, among them WWE, WCW, and the NWA.\n\nFunk was born on June 30, 1944 in Hammond, Indiana. He is the son of Dorothy (Culver) and Dory Funk, a professional wrestler and promoter. Following the end of World War II, the family relocated to Amarillo, Texas, where Terry and his brother Dory, Jr., grew up in the professional wrestling business. After graduating from high school, Funk attended West Texas State University (now West Texas A&M University), where he competed in amateur wrestling and football.\n\nFunk started his career in 1965, working in his father Dory Funk's, Western States Sports promotion in Amarillo, Texas. He and his brother, Dory Funk, Jr., quickly rose up the ranks as a team and in single matches against top names like Ernie Ladd and Hank James. They became big money wrestlers by the end of the decade.\n\nIn 1975, Terry defeated Jack Brisco for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Miami, when Dory failed to appear for a title shot. He began a fourteen-month title reign defending the title against Jack Brisco, Dusty Rhodes, Carlos Rocha, Giant Baba and Pat O`Connor. In addition to North America, he defended the belt in Australia, Japan and Singapore. The historic reign ended in Toronto when he was defeated by \"Handsome\" Harley Race, who had earlier beaten Dory, Jr., for NWA World Heavyweight Championship before losing it to Jack Brisco. Race lifted Funk for a shinbreaker and then trapped him in an Indian death leglock. When Funk failed to respond to referee Fred Atkins the match was stopped.\n\nDuring 1981, Terry spent some time in the Continental Wrestling Association feuding with Jerry Lawler. The most memorable match in this feud happened in April 1981 at the Mid South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee. The match took place in the empty arena, with only Lance Russell, a cameraman, and a photographer present. Funk had challenged Lawler to this match at this time because he felt he was getting unfairly treated in Memphis. The confrontation only lasted a few minutes, and ended with Funk trying to put Lawler's eye out with a broken 2x4. But Lawler kicked Funk's elbow, causing him to hit himself in the eye. The tape aired on April 25, 1981.\n\nTerry and Dory, Jr. also made a name for themselves in Japan. Terry became a star in the eyes of the Japanese fans with his over the top mannerisms, sometimes colorful get-ups, and his brawling ability. In Japan, the Funks were heels until they faced The Sheik and Abdullah The Butcher in Tokyo. The two later faced Stan Hansen, Bruiser Brody, and Giant Baba in memorable feuds as well.\n\nTerry Funk made his World Wrestling Federation (WWF) debut in 1985 after a brief run in the AWA. In his televised debut on \"Championship Wrestling\", he not only beat Aldo Marino, but he also beat on ring announcer Mel Phillips. Funk attacked Phillips, after Phillips made the mistake of putting on Funk's cowboy hat. Funk also had a gimmick of carrying a branding iron with him to ringside and using it to \"brand\" his fallen opponents. The attack on Phillips lead to a feud with Junkyard Dog. In the mid-1980s, Funk teamed with Dory (calling himself \"Hoss\" Funk) and Jimmy Jack Funk, a storyline \"brother.\" They were managed by Jimmy Hart. At the time, he had a heated rivalry with the Junkyard Dog which led to a match between Terry Funk and Hoss Funk and the team of Tito Santana and Junkyard Dog at WrestleMania 2. Terry also had a series of WWF title matches against Hulk Hogan.\n\nFunk joined World Championship Wrestling in 1989 and became part of the J-Tex Corporation. He began feuding with Ric Flair, who had defeated Ricky Steamboat at WrestleWar for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Funk, who was one of three judges for the main event, challenged Flair to a title match. Flair refused, saying that Funk was \"spending time in Hollywood\" instead of focusing on wrestling. Funk then attacked, piledriving Flair on a ringside table. This put the champion, Flair, out of action until the Great American Bash where he faced Funk. Flair won the match by reversing a small package into one of his own, but shortly after was attacked by Gary Hart and The Great Muta. Sting came to aid Flair and the two brawled with Funk and Muta to close the show. Funk got injured but returned to continue feuding with Ric Flair. The two then had an \"I Quit\" match at \"\", which Funk lost after yelling \"Yes, I quit!\" after Flair put on the Figure four leglock. This match received a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer. A notable part of the feud occurred when Funk used an actual plastic shopping bag to suffocate Flair on television after Flair and Sting defeated Muta and Dick Slater at \"\". After losing a \"Clash of Champions\" match against Flair, he shook Flair's hand, and was attacked by Gary Hart's stable. Soon after he became a color commentator and the host of his own segment \"Funk's Grill\" where a tuxedo clad Funk would amiably interview the top stars of WCW, both face and heel. This did not last long and he left soon after for the USWA.\n\nIn 1994, Funk reappeared in WCW and wrestled Tully Blanchard to a double disqualification at Slamboree 1994 and later that night, he became a member of Colonel Robert Parker's Stud Stable. Along with Bunkhouse Buck, Arn Anderson and Meng, the stable would focus their energies on Dusty and Dustin Rhodes, as well as The Nasty Boys, culminating in a War Games match at Fall Brawl.\n\nIn 1994, Terry Funk would join the fledgling IWA Japan wrestling promotion. Funk would go on to be a participant in IWA's most famous event the King of the Death Match Tournament, held on August 20, 1995 in Kawasaki. Funk would first defeat Leatherface and Tiger Jeet Singh in extreme-style matches which featured barbed wire covered boards, glass, and chains before moving on to the finals of the tournament. In the finals, Funk was defeated by protégé Cactus Jack, later known by US audiences as Mick Foley, in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Exploding Barbed Wire Boards & Exploding Ring Time Bomb Death Match. Besides \"The King Of the Death Match\" show. Terry in the same promotion, IWA Japan, would participate in some of the most dangerous matches in the world at the time. Terry put on fire death matches, and very intense barbed wire matches. Terry and Mick Foley battled in a fire no roped barbed wire death match in early 1995. The event was titled \" The Duel Of The Wilds \" which could debated in terms of violence compared to \" The Kawasaki dream \" death match tournament.\n\nLater in Funk's career, his style changed from wrestling traditional southern style wrestling matches to the more violent style of hardcore wrestling. In 1993, after a special appearance against Blanchard at World Championship Wrestling's Slamboree, Funk promised to help the fledgling Eastern Championship Wrestling (later renamed Extreme Championship Wrestling or ECW) by lending his talent and notoriety to the promotion. On July 16, Terry and Dory Funk lost a barbed wire match against The Public Enemy. Funk maintained a regular schedule of wrestling for ECW in its early days while also competing in Japan. He had many feuds and wrestled programs with wrestlers such as Cactus Jack, \"The Franchise\" Shane Douglas, The Sandman, Sabu, and Terry's own protege, Tommy Dreamer.\n\nFunk further elevated ECW by headlining their first pay-per-view, Barely Legal on April 13, 1997, winning the ECW World Heavyweight Championship from Raven. Earlier in the night, he defeated The Sandman and Stevie Richards in a Triple Threat match, thus earning him the match with Raven. He was later defeated for the title by Sabu in a barbed wire match at \"Born to Be Wired\", in which the ropes of the ring were taken down and replaced with barbed wire. Both men had to be cut out of the wires at the end of the match. Sabu had his biceps visibly torn open by the barbed wire – as a result, the wound was taped up and the match continued. In September of that same year, a show was held in Funk's hometown of Amarillo. It was called \"WrestleFest – 50 Years of Funk\" and was both his own show and a celebration of the careers of Terry, his father, and his brother. Terry lost to then WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart in the main event, a non-title match. However, before the match, ECW owner Paul Heyman presented Terry with a belt, paid for through a collection taken up by wrestlers on the ECW roster, that declared him the \"Lifetime ECW World Heavyweight Champion\".\n\nFunk's retirement lasted just three months before he began taking bookings again. After several independent matches, most notable ones against Rik Ratchet that drew many fans on the east coast, Funk returned on the December 29, 1997 episode of \"Raw\". Funk returned to WWF as Chainsaw Charlie, although his true identity was soon acknowledged by the announcers, teaming with Mick Foley, who was wrestling under his Cactus Jack persona. Charlie and Jack would enter a feud with The New Age Outlaws, where they were defeated by them on the January 26, 1998 episode of \"Raw\" by disqualification. The following week on \"Raw\", Charlie and Jack would have a match against each other, with the match ending in a no contest after the Outlaws would attack both men, placing them both in a dumpster and then pushing it off the stage. At , Charlie and Jack would team with Stone Cold Steve Austin and Owen Hart, defeating the team of Triple H, Savio Vega and the Outlaws. At WrestleMania XIV, Charlie and Jack would defeat the Outlaws in a Dumpster match to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. The following night, on the March 30 episode of \"Raw\", Charlie and Jack would lose the titles back to the Outlaws in a Steel Cage match.\n\nOn the April 13 episode of \"Raw\", Funk would begin wrestling as himself, and forming a tag team with 2 Cold Scorpio. The team would be short lived, with them defeating the likes of The Quebecers and The New Midnight Express. On the May 4 episode of \"Raw\", Funk would be defeated by Foley in a Falls Count Anywhere match. On the June 1 episode of \"Raw\", Funk would be defeated by Mark Henry in a King of the Ring qualifying match. Funk then formed a short lived tag team with Justin Bradshaw, with them defeating Too Much on the July 25 episode of \"Shotgun Saturday Night\". At , Funk and Bradshaw would be defeated by Faarooq and Scorpio, with Bradshaw attacking Funk after the match. This would be Funk's final match in WWF, as he would once again retire from wrestling.\n\nAt ECW November to Remember, Funk was believed to have been Tommy Dreamer's mystery partner against Justin Credible and Jack Victory. However, the mystery partner turned out to be Jake Roberts. An enraged Funk attacked Dreamer at every opportunity in late 1998 and early 1999. Funk, however, came down ill before they could have a match, and Funk \"retired\" yet again in mid-1999.\n\nFunk wrestled for WCW in 2000 and 2001, winning the WCW Hardcore Championship three times (which stands as the company's record) and the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship for the second time. He was also the WCW Commissioner at one time and the leader of the short-lived Old Age Outlaws that feuded with the nWo.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Funk was a regular top star for Ring of Honor Wrestling and Major League Wrestling. Funk had several battles with the likes of CM Punk, the Extreme Horsemen (Steve Corino, C.W. Anderson, Justin Credible and Simon Diamond) in specialty matches such as a No Ropes Barbed Wire Death Match, and a 5 on 5 WarGames match. On the last MLW show, Funk was attacked by his former manager Gary Hart and his syndicate. In November 2004, Funk competed in the UK wrestling company FWA's annual show entitled British Uprising.

Funk's team emerged victorious in front of a crowd of 2,000 people in the Coventry Skydome.\n\nOn February 18, 2004, Funk competed for TNA where he and Raven defeated the team of Julio Dinero and CM Punk.\n\nIn 2005, Funk received an offer from World Wrestling Entertainment to appear at the ECW reunion show One Night Stand, but turned it down in favor of working the ECW nostalgia show \"Hardcore Homecoming\" that was being put together by Shane Douglas. At \"Hardcore Homecoming\", Funk lost a three-way barbed wire match to Sabu.\n\nFunk made a brief return to WWE in 2006, when he appeared on the May 15 episode of \"Raw\", confronting Mick Foley over the attack on Tommy Dreamer on the previous weeks episode of \"Raw\". At ECW One Night Stand, Funk would team with Dreamer and Beulah McGillicutty in a losing effort against Foley, Edge and Lita. Midway through the match, Foley injured Funk's left eye with barbed wire, and Funk was taken backstage. He later returned to the match (with a bloody cloth tied over his eye) to hit Foley with a flaming 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire.\n\nFunk, along with his brother Dory, was inducted in the WWE Hall of Fame in 2009 by his longtime friend Dusty Rhodes.

It was originally published from the Royal Greenwich Observatory in England. A detailed account of how the publication was produced in its earliest years has been published by the National Maritime Museum.\n\nSince 1958 (with the issue for the year 1960), [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]] and the [[US Naval Observatory]] have jointly published a unified \"Nautical Almanac\", for use by the navies of both countries.\n\nThe changing names and contents of related titles in the series are summarised as follows. (The issue years mentioned below are those for which the data in the relevant issue were calculated—and the issues were in practice published in advance of the year for which they were calculated, at different periods of history, anything from 1 to 5 years in advance).\n\nIn the UK, the official publications have been:\n\n\nThe main distinctive feature of the inaugural issue for 1767 was the tabulation of lunar distances as a tool to facilitate the determination of longitude at sea from observations of the Moon. Within a few years, the publishers of almanacs of other countries began to adopt the practice of tabulating lunar distances. Lunar distances continued to be published in the UK official almanacs until 1906, by which time their use had declined in practice. For some time thereafter, in the issues for the years 1907–1919, examples of how to calculate them were given instead.\n\nTime: The issues for 1767 to 1833 gave their ephemeris tabulations in terms of Greenwich apparent (not mean) time. This was on the grounds that an important class of user was the 'Mariner', and that 'apparent Time' was \"the same which he will obtain by the Altitudes of the Sun or Stars in the Manner hereafter prescribed\". Mean time at Greenwich (i.e. mean solar time) was adopted as from the issue for 1834 and continued to 1959. Until the issue for 1924, the time argument for Greenwich Mean Time was counted from 0h starting at Greenwich mean noon (on the civil day with the same number), and starting with the issue for 1925 the commencement point of the time argument was changed so that 0h became midnight at the beginning of the civil day with the relevant number, to coincide for the future with the civil reckoning.\n\nDuring parts of the period 1767–1959, separate subsidiary titles dedicated to navigation were also published:\n\n\nTime: A major change introduced with the 1960 issue of \"The Astronomical Ephemeris\" was the use of [[ephemeris time]] in place of mean solar time for the major ephemeris tabulations. But the \"Nautical Almanac\", now continuing as a separate publication addressed largely to navigators, continued to give tabulations based on mean solar time (UT).\n\n\nIn the US, an official (and initially separate) series of [[ephemeris]] publications began with the issue for 1855 as \"The [[American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac]]\"; but before that, the British \"Nautical Almanac\" was commonly used on American ships and in the United States – sometimes in the form of an independently printed American 'impression' instead.\n\nAlmanac data is now also available online from the [[US Naval Observatory]].\n\n\n[[Category:1767 establishments in Great Britain]]\n[[Category:British non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:United States Naval Observatory]]\n[[Category:Astronomical almanacs]]"}

The second edition contains a reordered selection of photographs and a missing diagram explaining the escape from the roof of the Marks and Spencer, as well as other useful information on night climbing.\n\nThe book was sought after, especially in Cambridge itself where it was regarded as one of few \"guidebooks\" to the routes onto the roofs of the town's ancient buildings. Famous climbs documented in the book are the King's College and St John's College chapels and the \"Senate House leap\" across Senate House Passage between Gonville and Caius College and the Senate House. \"The Night Climbers of Cambridge\" is often credited with inspiring the next generation of urban explorers and spawned many University of Cambridge legends and traditions. Since its publication several climbs of King's College Chapel have been completed.\n\nA new authorised edition was published on 26 October 2007 by Oleander Press, Cambridge, to mark the 70th anniversary of the original edition. The new edition was updated and has proved popular among Oxbridge students and urban explorers.\n\nIn addition to \"The Night Climbers of Cambridge\", an omnibus edition of \"The Roof Climber's Guide to Trinity\" was published on 11 July 2011 by Oleander Press. Its introduction contains further details about Symington and his book. In addition it included not before seen information on night-climbing and urban exploring in Cambridge and the surrounding towns, villages and country houses. The \"Roof Climber's Guide to Trinity\" has remained popular, though it is easier to find in bookshops than the original \"Night Climbers\".\n\nGiven its sometimes clandestine nature, some Cambridge students have described \"The Night Climbers of Cambridge\" as a modern day Marauder's Map of Harry Potter fame. In 2014, a team of Cambridge engineers designed an online app called the \"Cambridge Marauders Map\", which allowed friends to view their movements within the colleges of Cambridge and identify potential hazards. The Marauders Map app included many climbing and urban exploring features taken from \"The Night Climbers of Cambridge\". The app is no longer publicly available.\n\nSymington stood for Harborough in 1950 as an independent Mosleyite candidate, receiving 273 votes. In 1958 he published the book \"Return to Responsibility: A New Concept of the Case for Fascism in the Post-War World\".\n\n\"The Night Climbers of Cambridge\" is repeatedly referred to in \"The Bad Quarto\", a mystery novel by Jill Paton Walsh. Her novel mentions a supposed additional chapter regarding night climbing in St Agatha's College, the fictional Cambridge setting for most of Walsh's story's about Imogen Quy, college nurse at St Agatha's. Night climbing plays a central role in \"The Bad Quarto\", along with a production of the 1603 quarto version of \"Hamlet\".\n\n"}

Deane draws a number of conclusions and makes certain guesses regarding snake worship, not just confined to Europe, but indeed all over the world. Deane goes on in his title to list a number of associations to the serpent such as the dragon and the leviathan. So thorough (albeit outdated) is his research, that he has \"traced THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT from Babylonia, east and west, through Persia, Hindûstan, China, Mexico, Britain, Scandinavia, Italy, Illyricum, Thrace, Greece, Asia Minor, and Phœnicia.\" (Ch VIII)\n\n\n"}

The Verweyhal was built in the 19th century as a gentlemen’s society of the former drama society, later a cultural social club, Trou moet Blycken.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century the earlier building of the drama society, which was on the same spot, was too small. In 1876 the society held a competition for a new design. The Amsterdam architect A.J. van Beek won, and his plan was carried out with the help of local builder A. Raasveld. The building was occupied in 1880. The building is in the Eclectic style that was very popular at the end of the 19th century in Haarlem, but later fell out of fashion. In the first half of the 20th century, the building received a great deal of criticism. It was considered much too large and pompous. ‘An object of general contempt,’ according to the description of the distinguished gentlemen’s society.\n\nAlmost immediately, the gentleman's society had financial problems. Perhaps the building project had been a bit too prestigious. The gentlemen initially tried to alleviate the situation by raising their membership contribution. That did not help, because the number of members declined. As the increased contribution did not solve the problem, the ground floor was rented out as a shop. This income did not help either, and in 1922 the gentlemen were forced to sell the building to the city, which became the new owner for 125,000 guilders, and they moved to their current premises further down the Grote Houtstraat at number 115.\n\nThe society building was converted in 1924 into the \"Spaarnebank\". The safe was on the ground floor; offices were set up on the first floor. The building was called ‘an unsuccessful box of blocks’ in 1947 by the engineer G. Friedhoff, who wanted to demolish the building and replace it with traditional façades. \n\nMore renovations were carried out in 1978 when the first floor was remodelled to house the Department of Cultural Affairs, the local City Planning Authority and the office of the City Architect.\n\nFourteen years later, in 1992, the building was renovated again as a future exhibition hall to house the collection of the Haarlem artist Kees Verwey. With support from his newly formed Kees Verwey Foundation, the first floor received a new name: the Verweyhal. The former city architect Wiek Röling made a design for the new layout together with architect Jan Bernard. \n\nOpinions about the building changed in the 1970s, and for the first time, words of praise were heard. Today, the building is an official monument and still has a museological function.\n\nThe entrance today to the upper exhibition floors is through Museum De Hallen, Haarlem on the Grote Markt and no longer through the original main entrance on the Grote Houtstraat.\n\n"}
