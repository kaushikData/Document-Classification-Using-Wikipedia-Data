E-mails began appearing on WikiLeaks on February 27, 2012, with 5,543,061 emails published as of July 18, 2014.\n\nStratfor is a security group based in Austin, Texas. On December 24, 2011, hackers took control of Stratfor's website and released a list of names, credit card numbers, passwords, and home and email addresses. Those listed were affiliated with organizations such as Bank of America, the United States Department of Defense, Médecins Sans Frontières, Lockheed Martin, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and the United Nations. The hackers included Jeremy Hammond, who worked with Anonymous to release Stratfor's emails to WikiLeaks. The emails revealed Stratfor's surveillance of groups such as Occupy Wall Street and protestors of the Bhopal disaster.\n\nThe e-mails claim to include client information, notes between Stratfor employees and internal procedural documentation on securing intelligence data. These communications date from July 2004 through to December 2011. WikiLeaks said it had obtained the e-mails from the hacker group Anonymous, who broke into Stratfor's computer network in 2011. In an initial announcement, WikiLeaks stated that they opened up a database of the emails to two dozen media organizations operating in several countries, including the McClatchy Company, \"l'Espresso\", \"la Repubblica\", ARD, the \"Russia Reporter\", and \"Rolling Stone\", along with a \"sneak preview\" to the Yes Men.\n\nOne of the first items released was an email containing a glossary titled \"The Stratfor Glossary of Useful, Baffling and Strange Intelligence Terms\", which contained concise and sometimes humorously candid definitions, along with pointed assessments of U.S. intelligence and law enforcement.\n\nAn email involving a Stratfor analyst stated that it had been determined that up to 12 officials in Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency knew of Osama bin-Laden's safe house. \n\n\"Ynetnews\" reported that, according to internal emails between Stratfor employees, Israel and Russia were engaged in an exchange of information in 2008. Israel gave Russia \"'data link codes' for unmanned aerial vehicles that the Jewish state sold to Georgia\" and that Russia gave \"the codes for Tor-M1 missile defense systems that Russia sold Iran\". The emails also stated that, during the 2008 South Ossetia war, Georgia \"realized that their UAVs were compromised and were looking for a replacement for the Israeli made drones\".\n\n\"International Business Times\" reported that Stratfor had found that several Central European countries, especially the Czech Republic, have been petitioning NATO for missile defenses and F-16s to use against Russia. The Czech Republic, according to an unknown Stratfor source, has stated that, if the talks with the US fail, then it will be breaking all ties with NATO and the US in general.\n\n\"Business Insider\" reported that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was an intelligence source for Stratfor between 2007 and 2010. In emails, Fred Burton discussed his personal communications with Netanyahu. Burton stated by email that Netanyahu informed him of his success in consolidating power within the Likud party ahead of regaining the position of prime minister, shared thoughts regarding his distrust of US President Barack Obama, threatened assassination of Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah, and declared intentions to unilaterally start a war against Iran.\n\n\"Al Akhbar\", citing internal emails from the Stratfor hack, reported former Blackwater director James F. Smith had a relationship with Stratfor and was for a time considered one of their major sources. \nAs reported by \"The Times of India\", some of the emails reveal that Stratfor was allegedly hired by Dow Chemical Company to spy on protesters of the Bhopal disaster. Dow Chemical Company responded with a written statement that read: \"Major companies are often required to take appropriate action to protect their people and safeguard their facilities,\" and that it had not broken any laws.\n\nThe \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\" reported that, according to some of the released emails, the Coca-Cola Company paid Stratfor to determine \"to what extent will US-based PETA supporters travel to Canada to support activism\" at the 2010 Olympics. The Coca-Cola Company responded to the emails with a statement saying that they \"consider it prudent to monitor for protest activities at any major event we sponsor\".\n\nEmails from Fred Burton (Stratfor’s Vice-President for Counterterrorism and Corporate Security, and former Deputy Chief of the Department of State) allege a United States Government secret indictment against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\n\nOther emails cast doubt on the rape allegations against Assange.\n\nAround midnight on February 27, Stratfor released a statement saying that \"the release of its stolen emails was an attempt to silence and intimidate it.\" It also dismissed rumors of CEO George Friedman's resignation.\n\nStratfor stated that some of the leaked emails \"may be forged or altered to include inaccuracies; some may be authentic\", but that they would not confirm either possibility. They further stated that the emails represented candid internal language that would probably be ripe for misinterpretation.\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told Reuters that his concerns with Stratfor stem from it being a private intelligence firm relying on informants from government agencies with dubious reputations, both from the U.S. and abroad, and especially its monitoring of activist organizations. He also called the company a \"shadow CIA\" (a term originally coined by Barron's magazine in a 2001 article about the quality of Stratfor's analysis, not any actual association with the CIA) and stated that the emails would \"reveal Stratfor's web of informers, payoff structure, payment-laundering techniques and psychological methods.\"\n\nFormer NSA Director Bobby Inman stated that the leak would be damaging to Stratfor's business. He had previously stated that Stratfor was competent, delivering high-quality intelligence analyses.\n\nMax Fisher, the associate director of \"The Atlantic\", argued that Stratfor has a poor reputation \"among foreign policy writers, analysts, and practitioners\" and that as a result Anonymous and Wikileaks have exaggerated the significance of the information they released. He also suggested that Assange may have targeted a relatively unimportant firm and over-hyped the results in order to \"regain some of his former glory\". Australian Broadcasting Corporation foreign correspondent and Stratfor subscriber Mark Corcoran also wrote that the e-mails showed Stratfor's methods used to gather information are similar to those employed by journalists, though he wrote that the quality of its reports are often inferior to news reports.\n\n"}

It is located at 200 Vaughan Street in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company Archives are part of the Archives of Manitoba.\n\nThe archives also holds the papers of Manitoba premier Sir Hugh John Macdonald, son of Canadian prime minister Sir John A. Macdonald.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company Archives (HBCA) are thousands of mainly hand-written records and maps of the Hudson's Bay Company employees for hundreds of years. This important archive is one of Canada's national treasures, and is a part of the United Nations Memory of the World project. The purchase of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company is the largest land purchase in Canada's history. Rupert's Land referred to the vast water drainage basin that flows into Hudson Bay. The water basin includes the areas now known as Manitoba, Saskatchewan, parts of Alberta, Northern Ontario, Minnesota, and North Dakota. The lakes and rivers were used for travel and trading, and they stretch from Ontario to Alberta, and far south into what is now the United States.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company's records provide the original written history of the HBC since its inception in 1670 by Prince Rupert and others. Henry Hudson was the first European to explore and map the shores of the great bay. The first Hudson's Bay Company trading forts were built along the southern shores of Hudson Bay to provide the shortest trade route to Europe from the middle of North America. Rupert's Land consisted of the vast watershed of rivers that drained into Hudson Bay which gave access to the far western and central parts of North America. The abundance of archival documents provide the original written history of the fur trade, North American exploration and mapping, native peoples, treaty making, and the original development of the Nation of Canada. The thousands of documents supply important knowledge about the growth of the HBC's retail empire that led to one of the largest land purchases in world history, along with the original settlements of Western Canada. The archives protect the original written documents that detail the European exploration and settlement of the western frontier. Many of these documents provide detailed descriptions of native groups, forts, rivers, lakes, animals, populations, and the difficult working conditions of fur traders.\n\nThe Hudson's Bay Company Archives makes the records available and accessible to many people locally, nationally, and internationally. Their database can be searched online, and some documents are now available online.\n\n"}

The first ten are set in South America, where Bomba, a white boy who grew up in the jungle, tries to discover his origin. The second set of ten books shift the scene to Africa, where a slightly older Bomba has jungle adventures.\n\nA common theme of the Bomba books is that Bomba, because he is white, has a soul that is awake, while his friends, the dark-skinned natives, have souls that are sleeping. Richard A. Lupoff, in his book \"Master of Adventure\", a study of the works of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, describes the Bomba tales as more blatantly racist than the often-criticized Tarzan books.\n\nStarting in 1949, Monogram Pictures brought the character to the motion-picture screen in 12 Bomba films, starring Johnny Sheffield. Sheffield was already established as an outdoor star; he had portrayed the character Boy in the Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller. When the Bomba films, all set in Africa, proved popular with young audiences, the first 10 Bomba books were reprinted in the 1950s by Grosset & Dunlap, a publisher of many popular series books such as the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. These same books were reprinted again by Clover Books, a short-lived publisher that also reprinted the Grosset & Dunlap series Tom Quest.\n\nIn 1962, WGN-TV repackaged the Bomba films as a prime time summertime series called \"Zim Bomba\" that became a local ratings sensation. WGN executive Fred Silverman stated that \"Zim\" meant \"Son of\" in Swahili.\n\nIn 1967–68, DC Comics published a series of seven comic books based on the character.\n\nAll of the first editions had the same picture on the dust jacket; only the title was different. The Grosset & Dunlap books had different pictures on the dust jacket of each title. The Clover editions had no dust jackets but had picture covers reprinting the Grosset & Dunlap art.\n\n\nWalter Mirisch had been general manager of Monogram Pictures since 1945. They specialised in low budget movies, including series of regular characters such as Charlie Chan, Joe Palooka and the Bowery Boys. Mirisch looked at the success of the \"Tarzan\" films and remembered the \"Bomba\" novels; he thought they might offer material to do a similar type of movie.\n\nIn November 1947 Monogram announced they had bought the rights to twenty of the stories. They assigned Walter Mirisch to oversee their production and said they intended to make three \"Bomba\" films per year. They were going to be in colour. They were seeking a male actor aged 18 to 20 to star.\n\nIn September 1948 Monogram's president Steve Broidy announced that the studio would make two Bomba films over the following year. (Other series at the studio included Joe Palooka, Charlie Chan and Bowery Boys.)\n\nMirisch later claimed he was paid $2,500 a film, and the success of the series launched him as a producer.\n"}

Built about 1840 and remodeled in 1914, it is said to be \"The Oldest Homestead in America,\" since it sits on the foundations of a 1663 house, and has been continuously occupied. Circa 1914 two brothers, David Beach Boothe and Stephen Nichols Boothe, created the Boothe Memorial Museum which maintains a collection of twenty architecturally unique buildings. Some of the structures include a carriage house, Americana Museum, miniature lighthouse, windmill, a clock tower museum, trolley station, chapel, and a blacksmith shop. The property became a public park owned by the town of Stratford in 1949.\n\nBoothe Memorial Park and Museum was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 1, 1985.\n\nThe BMAS (Boothe Memorial Astronomical Society) Observatory was built in 1957 on the grounds of the park, located near the cemetery. The observatory features two telescopes: a 16-inch Cassegrain (1960) and 4 inch Unitron refractor.\n\nThe observatory is open for public observing at 8:00 p.m. on the first and third Friday of each month.\n\nOriginally constructed in 1844 for Congregationalist services, the Putney Chapel was moved onto Boothe Park grounds in 1968 from a nearby location on Chapel Street. The chapel is officially non-denominational, handicapped accessible and can still be used as a place of worship or for events, being rentable by the day.\n\nThe park also contains the last remaining highway toll booth in Connecticut. It was removed from the Milford side of the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge at the end of the Merritt Parkway, when state toll booths were abolished in June 1988.

{"id": "371696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371696", "title": "Chi Rho", "text": "Chi Rho\n\nThe Chi Rho (; also known as \"chrismon\" or \"sigla\") is one of the earliest forms of christogram, formed by superimposing the first two (capital) letters—chi and rho (ΧΡ)—of the Greek word (Christos) in such a way that the vertical stroke of the rho intersects the center of the chi.\n\nThe Chi-Rho symbol was used by the Roman emperor Constantine I (r. 306–337) as part of a military standard (vexillum). Constantine's standard was known as the Labarum. Early symbols similar to the Chi Rho were the Staurogram () and the IX monogram ().\n\nIn pre-Christian times, the Chi-Rho symbol was also to mark a particularly valuable or relevant passage in the margin of a page, abbreviating \"chrēston\" (good). Some coins of Ptolemy III Euergetes (r. 246–222 BC) were marked with a Chi-Rho.\n\nAlthough formed of Greek characters, the device (or its separate parts) is frequently found serving as an abbreviation in Latin text, with endings added appropriate to a Latin noun, thus \"XPo\", signifying \"Christo\", \"to Christ\", the dative form of \"Christus\".\n\nThe Chi Rho symbol has two Unicode codepoints: in the Miscellaneous symbols block and in the Coptic block.\n\n__toc__\n\nAccording to Lactantius, a Latin historian of North African origins saved from poverty by the Emperor Constantine I (r. 306–337), who made him tutor to his son Crispus, Constantine had dreamt of being ordered to put a \"heavenly divine symbol\" () on the shields of his soldiers. The description of the actual symbol chosen by Emperor Constantine the next morning, as reported by Lactantius, is not very clear: it closely resembles a Chi-Rho or a staurogram (), a similar Christian symbol. That very day Constantine's army fought the forces of Maxentius and won the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), outside Rome.\n\nEusebius of Caesarea (died in 339) gave two different accounts of the events. In his church history, written shortly after the battle, when Eusebius hadn't yet had contact with Constantine, he doesn't mention any dream or vision, but compares the defeat of Maxentius (drowned in the Tiber) to that of the biblical pharaoh and credits Constantine's victory to divine protection.\n\nIn a memoir of the Roman emperor that Eusebius wrote after Constantine's death (\"On the Life of Constantine\", circa 337–339), a miraculous appearance is said to have come in Gaul long before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. In this later version, the Roman emperor had been pondering the misfortunes that befell commanders who invoked the help of many different gods, and decided to seek divine aid in the forthcoming battle from the One God. At noon, Constantine saw a cross of light imposed over the sun. Attached to it, in Greek characters, was the saying \"Τούτῳ Νίκα!\" (“In this sign you will conquer!”). Not only Constantine, but the whole army saw the miracle. That night, Christ appeared to the Roman emperor in a dream and told him to make a replica of the sign he had seen in the sky, which would be a sure defence in battle.\n\nEusebius wrote in the \"Vita\" that Constantine himself had told him this story \"and confirmed it with oaths\" late in life \"when I was deemed worthy of his acquaintance and company.\" \"Indeed\", says Eusebius, \"had anyone else told this story, it would not have been easy to accept it.\"\n\nEusebius also left a description of the labarum, the military standard which incorporated the Chi-Rho sign, used by Emperor Constantine in his later wars against Licinius.\n\nAn early visual representation of the connection between the Crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection, seen in the 4th century sarcophagus of Domitilla in Rome, the use of a wreath around the Chi-Rho symbolizes the victory of the Resurrection over death.\n\nAfter Constantine, the Chi-Rho became part of the official imperial insignia. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence demonstrating that the Chi-Rho was emblazoned on the helmets of some Late Roman soldiers. Coins and medallions minted during Emperor Constantine's reign also bore the Chi-Rho. By the year 350, the Chi-Rho began to be used on Christian sarcophagi and frescoes. The usurper Magnentius appears to have been the first to use the Chi-Rho monogram flanked by Alpha and Omega, on the reverse of some coins minted in 353. In Roman Britannia, a tesselated mosaic pavement was uncovered at Hinton St. Mary, Dorset, in 1963. On stylistic grounds, it is dated to the 4th century; its central roundel represents a beardless male head and bust draped in a \"pallium\" in front of the Chi-Rho symbol, flanked by pomegranates, symbols of eternal life. Another Romano-British Chi-Rho, in fresco, was found at the site of a villa at Lullingstone (illustrated). The symbol was also found on Late Roman Christian signet rings in Britain.\n\nIn Insular Gospel books, the beginning of Matthew 1:18, at the end of his account of the genealogy of Christ and introducing his account of the life, so representing the moment of the Incarnation of Christ, was usually marked with a heavily decorated page, where the letters of the first word \"Christi\" are abbreviated and written in Greek as \"XPI\", and often almost submerged by decoration. Though the letters are written one after the other and the \"X\" and \"P\" not combined in a monogram, these are known as Chi-Rho pages. Famous examples are in the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne.<ref>\n"}

Initially, it provided access to the depositions of Polish citizens who after World War II were interviewed as witnesses before the Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland. From 17 September 2017, the database also presents the accounts of Poles who fell victim to repressions perpetrated by Communist totalitarianism.\n\nThe Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland, set up in 1945, documented German crimes committed during World War II, conducted investigations and published the results of its activities. In 1949, its name was changed to the Main Commission for the Investigation of \"Hitlerite\" Crimes in Poland. The Commission was active throughout the country.\n\nThe Commission’s tasks, their scope expanded to include Communist terror, were taken over by the investigative division of the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) in 1998. The Commission’s documentation, including witness testimonies, was also passed over to the archives of the Institute. Acting on the basis of an agreement dated 11 February 2016, the IPN started submitting digital copies of these materials with the objective of making them available over the internet. The “Chronicles of Terror” website premiered on 4 August 2016, initially providing access to a database containing more than 500 testimonies given before the Commission.\n\nOn 25 January 2017 the Witold Pilecki Center for Totalitarian Studies signed an agreement with the Hoover Institution, pursuant to which “Chronicles of Terror” will be supplemented by depositions relating to Communist crimes, taken from the archives of Gen. Anders’ Army. After World War II, documents containing the accounts of Poles – both soldiers and civilians who left the Soviet Union together with the Polish Army – were deposited with the Hoover Library, for it was feared that they could have been seized by the Communist authorities.\n\n“Chronicles of Terror” contains nearly 4,000 depositions (the majority are also available in English translations). Accounts describing crimes committed during World War II in Warsaw and its environs were published in first order. The database also holds depositions made by former prisoners of extermination camps and concentration camps. Plans have been made for its progressive expansion by the addition of testimonies concerning events that occurred in other locations.\n\nIn the spring of 2017, it published more than 500 depositions depicting the German Terror in Kielce region, and these were followed in October 2017 by accounts describing crimes committed by the invaders in Radom region. The following topics are addressed in the database.\n\nThe database contains depositions pertaining to the complex of German camps in Oświęcim. These testimonies include the accounts both of prisoners of the concentration camp itself, and of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. A number of them depict the medical experiments carried out on inmates and Sonderkommando members fate.\n\nChronicles of Terror contains approximately 100 testimonies relating to the street executions that were regularly carried out in occupied Warsaw. The accounts include depositions made both by eyewitnesses and the families of victims. Selected testimonies have been brought together in a collection entitled \"Reign of terror – executions in the streets of Warsaw\"\n\nThe Chronicles of Terror archive also has in its possession a dozen or so depositions made by former inmates of Pawiak, including those of its female ward, the so-called Serbia. These testimonies describe conditions existing in the prison, the methods of torture used, and the murders committed within its walls. A part of them has been gathered in the collection entitled \"Pawiak – the Warsaw execution site.\"\n\nMore than 30 depositions devoted to the Ochota Massacre are available in the database. Amongst them are the accounts of employees of the Radium Institute: Antoni Borowiecki, Bronisława Mazurkiewicz and Józef Laskowski, who were eyewitnesses to the crimes committed at the facility. The website also presents depositions made by Karol Cugowski, Józef Górski and Lucjan Majchrzak, who survived the mass executions carried out in Grójecka Street despite having suffered gunshot wounds. The murders and rapes committed in the “Zieleniak” have been referred to, among others, in the account of Kazimierz Sucharzewski, who was forced by the executioners to assist in the burning of the bodies of victims, and that of an officer of the Home Army, Fryderyk Korsak-Bartonezz. Romuald Jakubowski and Maria Lachert, in turn, witnessed the murder of the wounded by German units in field hospitals. The remaining accounts contain descriptions of crimes committed, among others, in Kolonia Lubeckiego, Kolonia Staszica and the so-called Reduta Wawelska (Wawelska Stronghold). Selected depositions have been gathered in the collection entitled \"Ochota Massacre – the suffering of the district.\"\n\nThe database holds more than 100 depositions concerning the Wola Massacre. Amongst them is the testimony of Janina Rozińska, who was wounded by a grenade during the mass execution carried out at the Tramcar Depot in Młynarska Street, and of Wiesława Chełmińska, who, despite being shot, survived the series of murders perpetrated in St. Lazarus’ Hospital. Wacław Dąbrowski and Father Bernard Filipiuk escaped death and were able to describe the mass shooting carried out at the corner of Górczewska and Zagłoby streets, and also the crimes perpetrated at the Wolski Hospital in Płocka Street. In turn, the account of Wanda Lurie (who was eight months pregnant at the time) relates to the execution conducted in the Ursus Factory at Wolska Street 55, during which she lost three children and herself received a number of injuries. Finally, Kazimierz Gębczyński provided testimony on the crimes committed at Staszica Street 15, where he himself received a gunshot wound. The database also contains the accounts of members of the so-called \"Verbrennungskommando\" (Wacław Dziewulski, Mieczysław Gurbiel, Witold Guzikowski, Mieczysław Miniewski, Stanisław Turek and Franciszek Zasada), who were forced by the Germans to assist in the burning of the bodies of victims. The remaining depositions refer, among others, to the crimes perpetrated by German units in Franaszek’s Factory, Sowińskiego Park, and the area of Wolska Street and Górczewska Street. A part of these have been grouped in a special collection entitled \"Genocide in Wola – a district sentenced to death\".\n\nThe testimony database includes more than 30 depositions that describe the functioning of this extermination camp. The accounts of former inmates have been supplemented with those of railway employees – witnesses to the transports arriving in Treblinka. A selection has been incorporated in the batch entitled \"Treblinka – a complex for the extermination of the Polish Jews.\"\n\n“Chronicles of Terror” contains a few dozen depositions concerning the crimes perpetrated in the “Police District” during the Warsaw Uprising. Among others, they portray the mass executions held in the Open-air Kindergarten at Bagatela Street, in the ruins of the pavilion of the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces and in Anc’s Pharmacy, and also the events that took place in the Gestapo building at Szucha Avenue. Witnesses include the women who were used by the Germans to act as human shields for their tanks. Selected depositions have been brought together in the collection entitled \"Crimes in the “police district” – tragedy of insurgent Warsaw.\"\n\nThis contains the depositions of people who had been arrested and sentenced to terms of imprisonment in corrective forced labor camps (Soviet forced labor camps). They provide graphic descriptions of the brutal interrogation methods used by the NKVD, the conditions existing in Soviet prisons and camps, and the back-breaking labor which the detainees were forced to perform. Many of the witnesses have also described how they were freed on the basis of the so-called “amnesty”, and somehow managed to reach Gen. Anders’ Army.\n\nA separate section contains the testimonies of people who were deported to the USSR in the years 1940-1941 on the basis of administrative decisions issued by the NKVD. These were primarily “enemies of the people” (as they were termed by the Soviet authorities), that is military settlers, foresters, civil servants, and members of their families. The deportees have described the conditions they were forced to endure during transport and at their points of destination. Numerous depositions depict the mind-numbing poverty that they faced while in exile. Some contain information about relations between the expellees themselves, and also their contacts with the local populace.\n\nThis batch of depositions was written down by Polish soldiers who following the September Campaign of 1939 were detained by the Soviets as prisoners of war and ended up in NKVD POW camps or forced labor camps for POWs. Their accounts provide a description of life in the camps, of interrogation techniques, and the methods used by the NKVD to turn prisoners into informers, and also present the tools of Communist propaganda applied against Polish POWs. Following the so-called “amnesty”, the majority of these witnesses enlisted in Gen. Anders’ Army.\n\n\n"}

While they are both called stylesheet languages, they have very different purposes and ways of going about their tasks.\n\nCSS is designed around styling a document, structured in a markup language, HTML and XML (including XHTML and SVG) documents. It was created for that purpose. The code CSS is non-XML syntax to define the style information for the various elements of the document that it styles.\n\nThe language to structure a document (markup language) is a prelimit to CSS. A markup language, like HTML and less XUL, may define some primitive elements to style a document, for example <emphasis> to bold. CSS post styles a document to \"screen media\" or \"paged media\".\n\nScreen media, displayed as a single page (possibly with hyperlinks), that has a fixed horizontal width but a virtually unlimited vertical height. Scrolling is often the method of choice for viewing parts of screen media. This is in contrast to \"paged media\", which has multiple pages, each with specific fixed horizontal and vertical dimensions. To style paged media involves a variety of complexities that screen media does not. Since CSS was designed originally for screen media, its paged facilities lacked.\n\nCSS version 3.0 provides new features that allow CSS to more adequately style documents for paged display.\n\nXSL has evolved drastically from its initial design into something very different from its original purpose. The original idea for XSL was to create an XML-based styling language directed toward paged display media. The mechanism they used to accomplish this task was to divide the process into two distinct steps.\n\nFirst, the XML document would be transformed into an intermediate form. The process for performing this transformation would be governed by the XSL stylesheet, as defined by the XSL specification. The result of this transformation would be an XML document in an intermediate language, known as XSL-FO (also defined by the XSL specification).\n\nHowever, in the process of designing the transformation step, it was realized that a generic XML transformation language would be useful for more than merely creating a presentation of an XML document. As such, a new working group was split off from the XSL working group, and the XSL Transformations (XSLT) language became something that was considered separate from the styling information of the XSL-FO document. Even that split was expanded when XPath became its own separate specification, though still strongly tied to XSLT.\n\nThe combination of XSLT and XSL-FO creates a powerful styling language, though much more complex than CSS. XSLT is a Turing complete language, while CSS is not; this demonstrates a degree of power and flexibility not found in CSS. Additionally, XSLT is capable of creating content, such as automatically creating a table of contents just from chapters in a book, or removing/selecting content, such as \"only\" generating a glossary from a book. XSLT version 1.0 with the EXSLT extensions, or XSLT version 2.0 is capable of generating multiple documents as well, such as dividing the chapters in a book into their own individual pages. By contrast, a CSS can only selectively remove content by not displaying it.\n\nXSL-FO is unlike CSS in that the XSL-FO document stands alone. CSS modifies a document that is attached to it, while the XSL-FO document (usually the result of the transformation by XSLT of the original document) contains all of the content to be presented in a purely presentational format. It has a wide range of specification options with regard to paged formatting and higher-quality typesetting. But it does not specify the pages themselves. The XSL-FO document must be passed through an XSL-FO processor utility that generates the final paged media, much like HTML+CSS must pass through a web browser to be displayed in its formatted state.\n\nThe complexity of XSL-FO is a problem, largely because implementing an FO processor is very difficult. CSS implementations in web browsers are still not entirely compatible with one another, and it is much simpler to write a CSS processor than an FO processor. However, for richly specified paged media, such complexity is ultimately required in order to be able to solve various typesetting problems.\n\n\n"}

The original, Japanese-language edition was released in Japan on December 4, 2008, in Europe in English on June 20, 2008, in Australia on July 3, 2008, and in North America on November 24, 2008. \"Cooking Guide\" is part of both Nintendo's Touch! Generations brand and a cooking tutorial software series started from a Japan-only title, \"Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi\". In North America, it is also part of the \"Personal Trainer\" series.\n\n\"Cooking Guide\" is an \"interactive cooking aid\" that gives step by step instructions on how to cook from a range of 245 dishes. The user is guided through the preparation and cooking process via audio narration and instructional video clips, and the user can use the Nintendo DS's voice recognition to proceed through each cooking step. Users can also choose recipes based on how many calories they have, or what ingredients the user currently has at hand, among other options. \"Cooking Guide\" also keeps in memory what dishes the player has already made. The application also allows users to take notes and compile a shopping list, and features functions such as a cooking timer and a quantity calculator. As a bonus, the Game & Watch game \"Chef\" can also be played after the user unlocks it by using the timer during preparation of a recipe like in one of its predecessors \"Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi\". They guide the users in either English, French, Italian, German or Spanish.\n\nReleased in Japan in 2006, \"Cooking Guide\" was originally shown to the US during Nintendo's Media Briefing at the Hollywood Kodak Theater at E3 2008. It was later shown at the Nintendo US Press Conference Live Blog in San Francisco in October 2008. After selling 600,000 units total in North America and Europe during its first two days of sales, Nintendo announced on April 27, 2009 that the game would be packaged with the latest color to be added to the DS Lite's hardware rainbow which is green. The Green-colored version of the DS lite was released on May 3, 2009.\n\nThe game was generally well-received, receiving an 81% from Metacritic. \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" felt \"Cooking Guide\"'s features makes it \"actually better than your average recipe book\" and praised both the ease of use of the software and the range of recipes it offers, but felt that the European retail price it was being sold at was too steep. They gave it 80%. Pocketgamer felt that while practiced cooks will have little use for it, on the whole it was more useful than other Touch! Generations titles such as \"\". IGN gave \"Personal Trainer: Cooking\" a 9/10, praising its accessibility, user interface and features such as the instructional audio narration. It was awarded Best Use of Sound by IGN in their 2008 video game awards.\n\n\"Cooking Guide\" received an Excellence Prize for Entertainment at the 2006 Japan Media Arts Festival. Supermarket chain Asda has claimed that \"Cooking Guide\" has sold over 10,000 copies in the first hour of release alone, and has also positively affected the sales of products used in the application's recipes. The North American version was the 13th best-selling game and third best-selling Nintendo DS game of December 2008 in the United States.\n\n\"Cooking Guide\" was the first of five sequels to the Japan-only \"Shaberu! DS Oryōri Navi\", with development split between Nintendo and Koei. Nintendo itself issued a Japan only sequel and the North America-only 2010 release \"America's Test Kitchen: Let's Get Cooking\", based on the PBS program, America's Test Kitchen after \"Cook's Illustrated\" magazine helped the publisher to write the game. \n\nKoei's releases are both Japan only, with the company releasing and .\n\nA musical remix based on this Nintendo DS title was used in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", where it was heard in the Kirby Final Smash update. This was only heard on the Japanese version of the official website; however, the song was added to all versions of \"Super Smash Bros.

First responders in Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia have recently begun using the ERG as well. It is produced by the United States Department of Transportation, Transport Canada, and the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico). The principal authors of the ERG are Transport Canada's Michel Cloutier and U.S. DOT's George Cushmac. \n\nThe ERG is primarily applicable for hazardous materials transported by highway and railway, but also is applicable for materials transported by air or waterway, as well as by pipeline. It was first issued by the US Department of Transportation in 1973, but later became a joint publication of the Department of Transportation (US DOT), Transport Canada (TC), and the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) of Mexico, with collaboration with the Chemistry Information Center for Emergencies (CIQUIME) of Argentina. The ERG is issued every 4 years, with editions now being published in Spanish (Guía de Respuesta en Caso de Emergencia). In 1996 it was published as the North American Emergency Response Guidebook, but by the next publication in 2000 \"North American\" was removed due to its use by several South American countries).\nThe ERG \"is primarily a guide to aid first responders in quickly identifying the specific or generic hazards of the material(s) involved in the incident, and protecting themselves and the general public during the initial response phase of\nthe incident\" and should only be used for the \"initial response phase\" (\"that period \nfollowing arrival at the scene of an incident during which the presence and/or identification \nof dangerous goods is confirmed, protective actions and area securement are initiated, and \nassistance of qualified personnel is requested.\") of an incident . It is divided into six color-coded sections (white [uncolored], yellow, blue, orange, green, and a second white [uncolored]). The ERG includes 62 \"Guides\" (found in the Orange Section) that identify the primary hazards associated with the applicable general category of hazardous material and general guidance on how to respond to incidents involving that general category of hazardous material. The primary purpose of ERG is to direct the emergency responders to the most appropriate of these guides, based on the incident. The ERG also provides guidance regarding recommended evacuation distances, if applicable, in the Green Section.\n\nThe first section, with white page (uncolored) borders, provides the following:\n\nThe second section, with yellow page borders, references the material in order of its assigned 4-digit ID number/UN/NA number (which is often placarded with the other hazardous materials placards) and identifies the appropriate guide number to reference in the Orange Section). Items highlighted in green in this section will have evacuation distances included in the Green Section.\n\nThe third section, with blue page borders, references the material in alphabetical order of its name and identifies the appropriate guide number to reference in the Orange Section). Items highlighted in green in this section will also have evacuation distances included in the Green Section.\n\nThe fourth section, with orange page borders, includes the actual response guides. Each of the 62 guides provides safety recommendations and directions on how to proceed during the initial response phase (first thirty minutes) of the incident. It includes \"health\" and \"fire or explosion\" potential hazard information (with the more dangerous hazard listed first). For example, \"the material gives off irritating vapors, easily ignited by heat, reactive with water\"; \"highly toxic, may be fatal if inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through skin\"; etc. \nNext this section includes information for responders on appropriate protective clothing and possible evacuation information for either spill or fire is given. It also includes information on fighting fires (example, do not apply water to sodium), warnings for spills or leaks, and special directions for first aid (example, not to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the materials are toxic).\n\nIn the event of an unknown material, Guide #111 should be followed until more information becomes available.\n\nThe fifth section, with green page borders, suggests initial evacuation or shelter in place distances (protective action distances) for spills of materials that are Toxic-by-Inhalation (TIH). These distances vary based on the size of the spill (small or large) and whether the incident occurs during the day or at night. Only materials that were highlighted in green in the Yellow and Blue Sections are included in the Green Section.\nThis section also includes information regarding toxic gases that are produced when certain materials are spilled in water (as identified previously in this section).

The key difference in the characters is in their surnames: Mayall's character, known as \"Richard Richard\" in the TV show, is here referred to as \"Richard Twat\" (although he angrily insists on the pronunciation \"Thwaite\"). Edmondson's character changes from \"Edward Elizabeth Hitler\" in the TV/live show to \"Edward Elizabeth Ndingombaba\". Despite this difference, both characters retain the same personalities as their TV counterparts. The film was made at Ealing Studios and on location on the Isle of Wight.\n\nRichard \"Richie\" Richard (Rik Mayall) and Edward \"Eddie\" Elizabeth Ndingombaba (Adrian Edmondson) run the worst guest house in the United Kingdom. Their staff include a chef, an idiotic drunkard and an illegal immigrant who is unable to cook, and a waiter, whom Richie believes has checked into a psychiatric hospital. Both leave because of nonpayment for their employment, with the latter quitting because of the verbal abuse from his boss. The guests, including Mr Johnson (Bill Nighy), who reside in the pair's hotel are thoroughly dissatisfied by the poor service, and eventually decide to leave, except for Mrs Foxfur (Fenella Fielding) who lives there.\n\nLife seems bleak for Eddie and Richie, until it seemingly improves with the arrival of the \"Nice family\", headed by Mr Nice (Simon Pegg), and the famous Italian actress Gina Carbonara (Hélène Mahieu). Gina's decision to stay in the grotty house is primarily down to her need to seek safety from her ill-tempered fiancé Gino Bolognese (Vincent Cassel). However, thanks to the pair putting her names in lights outside the guest house to attract more guests, Gino eventually finds her. Forced to cook meals for the guest, Richie comes across some fish which fell off a military lorry, heading away from the nearby nuclear power station. Unknown to both him and Eddie, the fish had been contaminated by a radiation leak due to the power station's poor maintenance.\n\nHours after serving the radioactive fish, everybody becomes violently ill, projectile-vomiting at high velocity and in huge quantities - all except for Gina Carbonara, the only guest who did not eat the fish. In an act of spontaneous solidarity, every guest projectile-vomits on Gino at once, forcing him backwards out through a window, and off a cliff edge into the ocean. Government agents arrive to hush up the incident and give Eddie and Richie £10 million pounds, first-class tickets to the Caribbean, and new identities for both them and Gina, in exchange for their silence over the leak. The three accept the offer and head to the Caribbean. In the film's final scene, Eddie winks to the camera after commenting \"How lucky [Gino] was the only fatality. Otherwise there'd be a moral question-mark hanging over our escape.\"\n\n\n\"Empire\" gave the film two stars out of five stating \"The boys toil incredibly hard to make the whole thing work and, while there are some hilarious moments, it is far too patchy for a full feature film.\"\n\n"}

The building, restored for this purpose, is located in Hamamönü neighborhood Altındağ district. The library accommodates around 7,000 books and 100 periodicals, including the works of Ersoy and books written about him. The archive is dedicated to well-known authors native to Ankara and surrounding places. Books about Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1881–1938), the Gallipoli Campaign (1915–1916) and the War of Independence (1919–1923) are also part of the collection.\n\nAt the museum's ground floor, awarded literary works and author-signed books are exhibited in addition to periodicals on literature. Here is a special section allocated to the life and works of Mehmet Akif Ersoy, where his personal belonging are also on display. At the upper floor, books about Ankara and works of authors from Ankara are offered. Discussions on various authors, book signing events, poetry performances and writing workshops take also place at the museum library. It is the first of its kind in Turkey.

Similar to its desktop counterpart, Outlook Mobile offers an aggregation of attachments and files stored on cloud storage platforms; a \"focused inbox\" highlights messages from frequent contacts, and calendar events, files, and locations can be embedded in messages without switching apps. The app supports a number of email platforms and services, including Microsoft Exchange and Google Apps among others.\n\nFirst released in April 2014 by the venture capital-backed startup of the same name, Acompli was acquired by Microsoft in December 2014. On January 29, 2015, Acompli was re-branded as Outlook Mobile—sharing its name with the Microsoft Outlook desktop personal information manager and Outlook.com email service.\n\nAcompli was co-founded as a startup by Javier Soltero, the former chief technology officer of VMWare, alongside JJ Zhuang (CTO), and Kevin Henrikson (VP of Engineering). It received $7.3 million in funding from Redpoint Ventures, Harrison Metal and Felicis Ventures.\n\nIn order to distinguish itself from other recent email startups, such as Mailbox, Soltero decided to target the enterprise market—particularly, users of Microsoft Exchange servers. He felt that such users had been underserved by the lacking or non-existent support for Exchange in existing mail apps, believing that their developers—despite its wide adoption, \"do not fathom the possibility of anyone using Exchange.\" A result of this mandate was the decision to make the app a personal information manager rather than only an email client, integrating a calendar, a list of recent contacts, and a list of recent files from attachments and cloud storage services.\n\nAcompli was first released on April 25, 2014 for iOS. An Android version was released in September 2014. On November 26, 2014, an incomplete post on its official blog prematurely revealed that Acompli had been acquired by Microsoft. The acquisition, valued at over $200 million, was officially announced on December 1, 2014. Rajesh Jha, vice president of Microsoft's Outlook division, stated that \"We’re excited about what’s possible as we build on the app’s success and bring it together with work currently in progress by the Outlook team.\" Soltero assured users that the Acompli app would not be discontinued, and would continue to receive regular updates. On January 29, 2015, Acompli was re-branded as Outlook Mobile, uniting it with one of its original influences.\n\nOn February 4, 2015, Microsoft acquired Sunrise Calendar; on September 13, 2016, Sunrise ceased to operate, and an update was released to Outlook Mobile that contained enhancements to its calendar functions.\n\nOutlook Mobile is designed to consolidate functionality that would normally be found in separate apps on mobile devices, similarly to personal information managers on personal computers. is designed around four \"hubs\" for different tasks, including \"Mail\", \"Calendar,\" \"Files\" and \"People\". The \"People\" hub lists frequently and recently used contacts and aggregates recent communications with them, and the \"Files\" hub aggregates recent attachments from messages, and can also integrate with other online storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. To facility indexing of content for search and other features, emails and other information are stored on external servers.\n\nOutlook Mobile supports a large number of different e-mail services and platforms, including Exchange, iCloud, GMail, Google Apps, Outlook.com, and Yahoo! Mail. The app supports multiple email accounts at once.\n\nEmails are divided into two inboxes: the \"Focused\" inbox displays messages of high importance, and those from frequent contacts. All other messages are displayed within an \"Other\" section. Files, locations, and calendar events can be embedded into email messages. Swiping gestures can be used for deleting messages.\n\nLike the desktop Outlook, Outlook Mobile allows users to see appointment details, respond to Exchange meeting invites, and schedule meetings. It also incorporates the three-day view and \"Interesting Calendars\" features from Sunrise.\n\nFiles in the Files tab are not stored offline; they require Internet access to view.\n\nOutlook Mobile temporarily stores and indexes user data (including email, attachments, calendar information, and contacts), along with login credentials, in a \"secure\" form on Amazon Web Services servers located in the United States. On Exchange accounts, these servers identify as a single Exchange ActiveSync user in order to fetch e-mail. Additionally, the app does not support mobile device management, nor allows administrators to control how third-party cloud storage services are used with the app to interact with their users. Concerns surrounding these security issues have prompted some firms, including the European Parliament, to block the app on their Exchange servers. Microsoft maintains a separate, pre-existing Outlook Web Access app for Android and iOS.\n\nAcompli received mostly positive reception: James Kendrick of \"ZDNet\" considered the app a \"must-have\" for bring your own device scenarios, citing its focused inbox, convergence, and support for both personal and business-oriented e-mail platforms. However, he felt that the calendar was not \"fancy\", and lacked different view modes. Noting its level of support for Gmail, quicker deletion gesture, along with its \"clean approach\" to filtering through emails and other content, \"Engadget\" argued that Acompli \"can be a speedy and powerful tool if you're willing to take the time to learn its nuances.\"\n\nOn the day of its release, Acompli quickly reached the top 10 free \"Productivity\" apps on the iOS App Store.\n\n"}
{"id": "48560847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48560847", "title": "Peter F. Hamilton bibliography", "text": "Peter F. Hamilton bibliography\n\nList of works by or about British science fiction author Peter F. Hamilton.\n\n\nHamilton first came to prominence in the mid-1990s with three novels featuring the psychic detective Greg Mandel. Set in a near-future Britain which has been run into the ground by global warming and an authoritarian left-wing government, the books describe a society beginning to rebuild itself through the production of advanced technology. The books are a blend of lively scientific, political and social speculation mixed with elements of detective story.\n\n\nAfter the Greg Mandel novels, Hamilton wrote a space opera in three volumes, known collectively as \"The Night's Dawn Trilogy\". The three books are each well over a thousand pages long and are not standalone novels, totalling 1.2 million words. The trilogy is set in a universe with a wealth of worlds and artificial orbiting colonies. The plot is centered on the souls of the dead coming back from a hellish \"beyond\" to possess the living, and the latter fighting back. It was followed by a companion to the series, \"The Confederation Handbook\", an informational book containing data about the universe of the \"Night's Dawn\" trilogy. Hamilton re-set several earlier short stories set in the Confederation timeline, published as the collection \"A Second Chance at Eden\" (see \"Short story collections\" below), including the newly written title novella.\n\n\n\"Misspent Youth\" is much shorter than either the Night's Dawn novels or \"Fallen Dragon\", and again depicts a near-future version of Britain (but different from that in the Greg Mandel trilogy). It combines a rejuvenation theme with a growing preoccupation with the phenomenon of European integration from the Eurosceptic point of view. This was his least well received book critically. The author Graham Joyce has a cameo part in the book. \"Misspent Youth\" is placed in the same universe as the \"Commonwealth Saga\", though it is not integral to the storyline of those novels. Much of the technology used in those novels (rejuvenation and low-cost/high-capacity memory storage) is established within this book.\n\nThe \"Commonwealth Saga\" is published in two halves, \"Pandora's Star\" and \"Judas Unchained\". Set approximately 300 years later in the same universe as \"Misspent Youth\", it explores the social effects of the almost complete elimination of the experience of death following widespread use of the rejuvenation technique described in \"Misspent Youth\". In somewhat similar style to \"Night's Dawn\", Hamilton also outlines, in detail, a universe with a small number of distinct alien species interacting essentially peacefully and who suddenly become faced with an increasingly ominous external threat.\n\n\nSet in the same universe as the \"Commonwealth Saga\", the \"Void Trilogy\" is set 1200 years after the end of \"Judas Unchained\". The release date for the first book, \"The Dreaming Void\", was 3 August 2007. A time line that links the \"Commonwealth Saga\" with the \"Void Trilogy\", filling in the 1200-year gap, has been written by Hamilton.\n\nThe second book in the trilogy, \"The Temporal Void\", was published in 2008. The third book in the trilogy, \"The Evolutionary Void\", was published in August 2010.\n\n\n\nHamilton announced in 2011 that he is developing a new trilogy. He later cut this down to two books titled The Chronicle of the Fallers. It is a return to his Commonwealth Universe, set in the same time-frame as the Void Trilogy, and tells the story of Nigel Sheldon and what happened when he broke into the Void. On 19 March, both the cover art and release date for the first book, \"The Abyss Beyond Dreams\", was unveiled. The book was published on 21 October 2014. The second book, \"Night Without Stars\", was published September 22 ,2016.\n\nA children's fantasy series also known as \"Book of the Realms\". Taggie and Jemima are summer holidaying on their dad's farm. They know just what to expect—a tumbledown cottage, sunshine and strawberry-picking. But then Jemima sees a white squirrel wearing glasses… And things become even more extraordinary when their dad is captured and whisked away to a faerie world.\n\n\nAt the start of 2018, Hamilton and his publishers Macmillan announced a brand-new trilogy set in an entirely new universe called 'The Salvation Sequence'. The three novels titled, \"Salvation\", \"Salvation Lost\" and \"The Saint of Salvation\" Subsequent to that, on the 7th February 2018, the author published the first chapter of book one titled, 'Salvation'. The premise of book one follows two branching story lines, the opening line is set two hundred years in the future during 2204. In this period humanity have developed near-instantaneous space travel via 'trans-dimensional gates', placing them throughout the galaxy. The unintended consequence of this technology has made spaceships essentially redundant; however, when an unknown vessel is found on a recently explored world, a team of specialists are sent out to investigate both the craft and the astonishing contents therein. Meanwhile, the other story line will be set much farther in the future, the 51st century to be precise and follows a genetically engineered team of tier one special forces designed from the ground up to confront and destroy an age-old enemy, whose agenda is the total eradication of the human species.\n\nHis full-length novel, \"Fallen Dragon\", is in many ways a condensation of the ideas and styles (and even characters) of the \"Night's Dawn\" trilogy, if rather darker in tone. The stand-alone book describes a bleak corporatist society dominated by five mega-corporations which wield almost unlimited power. It describes the troubled military campaign by one of these companies to \"realise assets\" from a minor colony, through the eyes of a veteran mercenary. One of the more interesting aspects of the book was its unconventional description of a spacefaring society which has developed interstellar travel but only at vast expense, putting it out of the reach of many people and a one-way trip for most of the rest.\n\nSet in Newcastle upon Tyne in 2143, the \"Great North Road\" is a futuristic murder-mystery.\n\n\n"}

Beginning in 1868, it operated for 30 years in Madison, Indiana, pushing train cars up the steepest \"standard-gauge main-track grade\" in the United States.\n\nThe \"Reuben Wells\" is a helper locomotive that was built in 1868. It was designed to push train cars up the 5.89% incline of Madison Hill in Madison, Indiana, the steepest segment of standard-gauge main-track in the United States. Weighing , it was the most powerful locomotive in the world at the time. It is long. The locomotive is named after its designer, engineer Reuben Wells.\n\nThe \"Reuben Wells\" was made specifically for Madison Hill, Indiana, a long stretch of track that is known for having the steepest regular incline in the United States. The Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad tried many different methods to get train cars up the hill. The couplers used to connect the train cars were not strong enough to withstand being pulled up the hill, making it necessary for the cars to be pushed. Initially a team of horses was used to pull the train cars up the hill. Following this, a cogwheel system was in use for about twenty years. The \"Reuben Wells\" was the first steam engine to work the grade by adhesion alone, pushing the cars up the hill as well as supporting them on the descent.\n\nAfter the \"Reuben Wells\" was completed in the railroad shops in 1868, it pushed train cars up Madison Hill for thirty years before it was retired in 1898. It stayed in reserve for another seven years before it was retired permanently and sent to Purdue University in 1905. In the years that followed the \"Reuben Wells\" was included in several exhibitions, including the Chicago World's Fair in 1933–34 and the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1948–49. Afterward, it remained in Pennsylvania at Penn Central Railroad Company railroad yards. In 1968, the \"Reuben Wells\" was brought back to Indiana, where it was placed on permanent display at the Children's Museum of Indianapolis.\n\nIn 1966, Tom Billings, head of the Children's Museum advisory board, learned that the \"Reuben Wells\" was being kept in storage in Pennsylvania. On a vacation to Washington and Williamsburg, Billings decided to stop by to see the \"Reuben Wells\". After he saw it, he started trying to get the \"Reuben Wells\" to be permanently back in Indiana, specifically at the Children's Museum. Billings contacted Otto Frenzel, a member of the Pennsylvania Railroad board of directors, who disclosed that the railroad company was currently trying to find museums for its steam locomotives. At the time, the \"Reuben Wells\" was already promised to a museum in St. Louis. Advocates pointed out that the St. Louis museum was already getting several pieces, and St. Louis had no historical connection to the engine. The campaign was successful, and in May 1967, the Pennsylvania railroad president, Allen Greenough, announced that the \"Reuben Wells\" was coming to Indiana. It was shipped from Pennsylvania to Indiana on flatcars.\n\nThe \"Reuben Wells\" entered Indianapolis with much fanfare on June 11, 1968. A parade was organized to escort the train on the last leg of its journey, accompanied by the Central Indiana Council Boy Scout band and a motorcycle motorcade. The parade made its way down 38th Street and south on Meridian Street before turning into the Children's Museum. After successful fund-raising efforts from the Indiana Junior Historical Society and the Children's Museum Guild, the \"Reuben Wells\" was installed in a new train shed on the museum campus the next year. The train was moved into the new building in 1976, where it remains on view on the museum's lower level. Originally acquired as a permanent loan, the Reuben Wells is now within the permanent collection of the Children's Museum.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "479936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=479936", "title": "Rime dictionary", "text": "Rime dictionary\n\nA rime dictionary, rhyme dictionary, or rime book () is an ancient type of Chinese dictionary that collates characters by tone and rhyme, instead of by radical.\nThe most important rime dictionary tradition began with the \"Qieyun\" (601), which codified correct pronunciations for reading the classics and writing poetry by combining the reading traditions of north and south China.\nThis work became very popular during the Tang dynasty, and went through a series of revisions and expansions, of which the most famous is the \"Guangyun\" (1007–1008).\n\nThese dictionaries specify the pronunciations of characters using the \"fǎnqiè\" method, giving a pair of characters indicating the onset and remainder of the syllable respectively.\nThe later rime tables gave a significantly more precise and systematic account of the sounds of these dictionaries by tabulating syllables by their onsets, rhyme groups, tones and other properties.\nThe phonological system inferred from these books, often interpreted using the rime tables, is known as Middle Chinese, and has been the key datum for efforts to recover the sounds of early forms of Chinese.\nIt incorporates most of the distinctions found in modern varieties of Chinese, as well as some that are no longer distinguished. It has also been used together with other evidence in the reconstruction of Old Chinese (1st millennium BC).\n\nSome scholars use the French spelling \"rime\", as used by the Swedish linguist Bernard Karlgren, for the categories described in these works, to distinguish them from the concept of poetic rhyme.\n\nChinese scholars produced dictionaries to codify reading pronunciations for the correct recitation of the classics and the associated rhyme conventions of regulated verse.\nThe earliest rime dictionary was the \"Shenglei\" (lit. \"sound types\") by Li Deng (李登) of the Three Kingdoms period, containing more than 11,000 characters grouped under the five notes of the ancient Chinese musical scale.\nThe book did not survive, and is known only from descriptions in later works.\n\nVarious schools of the Jin dynasty and Northern and Southern dynasties produced their own dictionaries, which differed on many points.\nThe most prestigious standards were those of the northern capital Luoyang and the southern capital Jinling (modern Nanjing).\nIn 601, Lù Fǎyán (陸法言) published his \"Qieyun\", an attempt to merge the distinctions in five earlier dictionaries.\nAccording to Lu Fayan's preface, the initial plan of the work was drawn up 20 years earlier in consultation with a group of scholars, three from southern China and five from the north.\nHowever the final compilation was by Lu alone, after he had retired from government service.\n\nThe \"Qieyun\" quickly became popular as the standard of cultivated pronunciation during the Tang dynasty.\nThe dictionaries on which it was based fell out of use, and are no longer extant.\nSeveral revisions appeared, of which the most important were:\n\nIn 1008, during the Song dynasty, a group of scholars commissioned by the emperor produced an expanded revision called the \"Guangyun\".\nThe \"Jiyun\" (1037) was a greatly expanded revision of the \"Guangyun\".\nLu's initial work was primarily a guide to pronunciation, with very brief glosses, but later editions included expanded definitions, making them useful as dictionaries.\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, the oldest complete rime dictionaries known were the \"Guangyun\" and \"Jiyun\", though extant copies of the latter were marred by numerous transcription errors. Thus all studies of the \"Qieyun\" tradition were actually based on the \"Guangyun\". Fragments of earlier revisions of the \"Qieyun\" were found early in the century among the Dunhuang manuscripts, in Turfan and in Beijing.\n\nWhen the \"Qieyun\" became the national standard in the Tang dynasty, several copyists were engaged in producing manuscripts to meet the great demand for revisions of the work.\nParticularly prized were copies of Wáng Rénxū's edition, made in the early 9th century, by Wú Cǎiluán (呉彩鸞), a woman famed for her calligraphy.\nOne of these copies was acquired by Emperor Huizong (1100–1026), himself a keen calligrapher. It remained in the palace library until 1926, when part of the library followed the deposed emperor Puyi to Tianjin and then to Changchun, capital of the puppet state of Manchukuo. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, it passed to a book dealer in Changchun, and in 1947 two scholars discovered it in a book market in Liulichang, Beijing.\nStudies of this almost complete copy have been published by the Chinese linguists Dong Tonghe (1948 and 1952) and Li Rong (1956).\n\nThe \"Qieyun\" and its successors all had the same structure.\nThe characters were first divided between the four tones.\nBecause there were more characters of the \"level tone\" (平聲 \"píngshēng\"), they occupied two \"juan\" (卷 \"fascicle\", \"scroll\" or \"volume\"), while the other three tones filled one volume each.\nThe last category or \"entering tone\" (入聲 \"rùshēng\") consisted of words ending in stops \"-p\", \"-t\" or \"-k\", corresponding to words ending in nasals \"-m\", \"-n\" and \"-ng\" in the other three tones. Today, these final stops are generally preserved in southern varieties of Chinese, but have disappeared in most northern ones, including the standard language.\n\nEach tone was divided into rhyme groups (韻 \"yùn\"), traditionally named after the first character of the group, called the 韻目 \"yùnmù\" (\"rhyme eye\").\nLu Fayan's edition had 193 rhyme groups, which were expanded to 195 by Zhangsun Nayan and then to 206 by Li Zhou.\nThe following shows the beginning of the first rhyme group of the \"Guangyun\", with first character 東 (\"east\"):\n\nEach rhyme group was subdivided into homophone groups preceded by a small circle called a 紐 \"niǔ\" (\"button\").\nThe entry for each character gave a brief explanation of its meaning.\nAt the end of the entry for the first character of a homophone group was a description of its pronunciation, given by a \"fǎnqiè\" formula, a pair of characters indicating the initial (聲母 \"shēngmǔ\") and final (韻母 \"yùnmǔ\") respectively.\nThe formula was followed by the character 反 \"fǎn\" (in the \"Qieyun\") or the character 切 \"qiè\" (in the \"Guangyun\"), followed by the number of homophonous characters.\nFor example, the pronunciation of 東 was described using the characters 德 \"tok\" and 紅 \"huwng\", indicating \"tuwng\".\nIn the above sample, this formula is followed by the number 十七, indicating that there are 17 entries, including 東, with the same pronunciation.\n\nThe order of the rhyme groups within each volume does not seem to follow any rule, except that similar groups were placed together, and corresponding groups in different tones were usually placed in the same order. Where two rhyme groups were similar, there was a tendency to choose exemplary words with the same initial.\nThe table of contents of the \"Guangyun\" marks adjacent rhyme groups as \"tóngyòng\" (同用), meaning they could rhyme in regulated verse.\nIn the above sample, under the entry for the rhyme group 刪 in the last part the table of contents (on the right page) is the notation \"山同用\", indicating that this group could rhyme with the following group 山.\n\nThe following are the rhyme groups of the \"Guangyun\" with their modern names, the finals they include (see next section), and the broad rhyme groups (\"shè\" 攝) they were assigned to in the rime tables. A few entries are re-ordered to place corresponding rhyme groups of different tones in the same row, and darker lines separate the \"tongyong\" groups:\n\nThe rime dictionaries have been intensively studied as important sources on the phonology of medieval Chinese, and the system they reveal has been dubbed Middle Chinese. Since the \"Qieyun\" itself was believed lost until the mid-20th century, most of this work was based on the \"Guangyun\".\n\nThe books exhaustively list the syllables and give pronunciations, but do not describe the phonology of the language.\nThis was first attempted in the rime tables, the oldest of which date from the Song dynasty, but which may represent a tradition going back to the late Tang dynasty.\nThough not quite a phonemic analysis, these tables analysed the syllables of the rime books using lists of initials, finals and other features of the syllable.\nThe initials are further analysed in terms of place and manner of articulation, suggesting inspiration from Indian linguistics, at that time the most advanced in the world.\nHowever the rime tables were compiled some centuries after the \"Qieyun\", and many of its distinctions would have been obscure.\nEdwin Pulleyblank treats the rime tables as describing a Late Middle Chinese stage, in contrast to the Early Middle Chinese of the rime dictionaries.\n\nIn his \"Qièyùn kǎo\" (1842), the Cantonese scholar Chen Li set out to identify the initial and final categories underlying the fanqie spellings in the \"Guangyun\".\nThe system was clearly not minimal, employing 452 characters as initial spellers and around 1200 as final spellers.\nHowever no character could be used as a speller for itself.\nThus, for example,\nFrom this we may conclude that 東, 德 and 多 must all have had the same initial. By following such chains of equivalences Chen was able to identify categories of equivalent initial spellers, and similarly for the finals.\nMore common segments tended to have the most variants.\nWords with the same final would rhyme, but a rhyme group might include between one and four finals with different medial glides, as seen in the above table of rhyme groups.\nThe inventory of initials Chen obtained resembled the 36 initials of the rime tables, but with significant differences.\nIn particular the \"light lip sounds\" and \"heavy lip sounds\" of the rime tables were not distinguished in the fanqie, while each of the \"proper tooth sounds\" corresponded to two distinct fanqie initial categories.\n\nUnaware of Chen's work, the Swedish linguist Bernard Karlgren repeated the analysis identifying the initials and finals in the 1910s.\nThe initials could be divided into two broad types: grave initials (labials, velars and laryngeals), which combine with all finals, and acute initials (the others), with more restricted distribution.\nLike Chen, Karlgren noted that in syllables with grave initials, the finals fell into two broad types, now usually referred to (following Edwin Pulleyblank) as types A and B.\nHe also noted that these types could be further subdivided into four classes of finals distinguished by the initials with which they could combine.\nThese classes partially correspond to the four rows or \"divisions\", traditionally numbered I–IV, of the later rime tables.\nThe observed combinations of initials and finals are as follows:\nSome of the \"mixed\" finals are actually pairs of type B finals after grave initials, with two distinct homophone groups for each initial, but a single final after acute initials. These pairs, known as \"chongniu\", are also marked in the rime tables by splitting them between rows III and IV, but their interpretation remains uncertain. There is also no consensus regarding which final of the pair should be identified with the single final occurring after acute initials.\n\nKarlgren also sought to determine the phonetic values of the abstract categories yielded by the formal analysis, by comparing the categories of the \"Guangyun\" with other types of evidence, each of which presented their own problems. The Song dynasty rime tables applied a sophisticated featural analysis to the rime books, but were separated from them by centuries of sound change, and some of their categories are difficult to interpret. The so-called Sino-Xenic pronunciations, readings of Chinese loanwords in Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese, were ancient, but affected by the different phonological structures of those languages. Finally modern varieties of Chinese provided a wealth of evidence, but often influenced each other as a result of a millennium of migration and political upheavals.\nAfter applying a variant of the comparative method in a subsidiary role to flesh out the rime dictionary evidence, Karlgren believed that he had reconstructed the speech of the Sui-Tang capital Chang'an.\n\nLater workers have refined Karlgren's reconstruction.\nThe initials of the \"Qieyun\" system are given below with their traditional names and approximate values:\nIn most cases, the simpler inventories of initials of modern varieties of Chinese can be treated as varying developments of the \"Qieyun\" initials. The voicing distinction is retained in Wu Chinese dialects, but has disappeared from other varieties. Except in the Min Chinese dialects, a labiodental series has split from the labial series, a development already reflected in the Song dynasty rime tables. The retroflex and palatal sibilants had also merged by that time. In Min dialects the retroflex stops have merged with the dental stops, while elsewhere they have merged with the retroflex sibilants. In the south these have also merged with the dental sibilants, but the distinction is maintained in most Mandarin Chinese dialects. The palatal series of modern Mandarin dialects, resulting from a merger of palatal allophones of dental sibilants and velars, is a much more recent development.\n\nAssigning phonetic values to the finals has proved more difficult, as many of the distinctions reflected in the \"Qieyun\" have been lost over time.\nKarlgren proposed that type B finals contained a palatal medial , a position that is still accepted by most scholars. However Pulleyblank, noting the use of these syllables in the transcription of foreign words without such a medial, claims the medial developed later.\nA labiovelar medial is also widely accepted, with some syllables having both medials.\nThe codas are believed to reflect those of many modern varieties, namely the glides and , nasals , and and corresponding stops , and .\nSome authors argue that the placement of the first four rhyme groups in the \"Qieyun\" suggests that they had distinct codas, reconstructed as labiovelars and .\nMost reconstructions posit a large number of vowels to distinguish the many \"Qieyun\" rhyme classes that occur with some codas, but the number and the values assigned vary widely.\n\nThe Chinese linguist Li Rong published a study of the early edition of the \"Qieyun\" found in 1947, showing that the expanded dictionaries had preserved the phonological structure of the \"Qieyun\" intact, except for a merger of initials /dʐ/ and /ʐ/.\nFor example, although the number of rhyme groups increased from 193 in the earlier dictionary to 206 in the \"Guangyun\", the differences are limited to splitting rhyme groups based on the presence or absence of a medial glide .\n\nHowever the preface of the recovered \"Qieyun\" suggests that it represented a compromise between northern and southern reading pronunciations.\nMost linguists now believe that no single dialect contained all the distinctions recorded, but that each distinction did occur somewhere.\nFor example, the \"Qieyun\" distinguished three rhyme groups 支, 脂 and 之 (all pronounced \"zhī\" in modern Chinese), although 支 and 脂 were not distinguished in parts of the north, while 脂 and 之 rhymed in the south.\nThe three groups are treated as \"tongyong\" in the \"Guangyun\" and have merged in all modern varieties. \nAlthough Karlgren's identification of the \"Qieyun\" system with a Sui-Tang standard is no longer accepted, the fact that it contains more distinctions than any single contemporary form of speech means that it retains more information about earlier stages of the language, and is a major component in the reconstruction of Old Chinese phonology.\n\nFrom early in the Tang dynasty, candidates in the imperial examination were required to compose poetry and rhymed prose in conformance with the rhyme categories of the \"Qieyun\".\nHowever, the fine distinctions made by the \"Qieyun\" were found overly restrictive by poets, and Xu Jingzong and others suggested more relaxed rhyming rules.\nThe \"Píngshuǐ\" (平水) system of 106 rhyme groups, first codified during the Jin dynasty, eventually became the prescribed system for the imperial examination.\nIt became the standard for official rhyme books, and was also used as the classification system for such reference works as the \"Peiwen Yunfu\".\n\nThe \"Píngshuǐ\" rhyme groups are the same as the \"tóngyòng\" groups of the \"Guangyun\", with a few exceptions:\n\nYan Zhengqing's \"Yunhai jingyuan\" (c. 780) was the first rime dictionary of multisyllabic words rather than single characters.\nThough no longer extant, it served as the model for a series of encyclopedic dictionaries of literary words and phrases organized by \"Píngshuǐ\" rhyme groups, culminating in the \"Peiwen Yunfu\" (1711).\n\nA side-effect of foreign rule of northern China between the 10th and 14th centuries was a weakening of many of the old traditions. New genres of vernacular literature such as the \"qu\" and \"sanqu\" poetry appeared, as well as the \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\", created by Zhōu Déqīng (周德清) in 1324 as a guide to the rhyming conventions of \"qu\". The \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\" was a radical departure from the rhyme table tradition, with the entries grouped into 19 rhyme classes each identified by a pair of exemplary characters. These rhyme classes combined rhymes from different tones, whose parallelism was implicit in the ordered of the \"Guangyun\" ryhmes. The rhyme classes are subdivided by tone and then into groups of homophones, with no other indication of pronunciation. The dictionary reflects contemporaneous northern speech, with the even tone divided in upper and lower tones, and the loss of the Middle Chinese final stops. Such syllables, formerly grouped in the entering tone, are distributed between the other tones, but placed after the other syllables with labels such as 入聲作去聲 (\"rùshēng zuò qùshēng\" \"entering tone makes departing tone\").\n\nThe early Ming dictionary \"Yùnluè yìtōng\" (韻略易通) by Lan Mao was based on the \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\", but arranged the homophone groups according to a fixed order of initials, which were listed in a mnemonic poem in the \"ci\" form.\nHowever, there could still be multiple homophone groups under a given rhyme group, tone and initial, as medial glides were not considered part of the rhyme.\nFurther innovations are found in a rime dictionary from the late 16th century describing the Fuzhou dialect, which is preserved, together with a later redaction, in the \"Qi Lin Bayin\".\nThis work enumerates the finals of the dialect, differentiated by both medial and rhyme, and classifies each homophone group uniquely by final, initial and tone.\nBoth finals and initials are listed in \"ci\" poems.\n\nTangut was the language of the Western Xia state (1038–1227), centred on the area of modern Gansu.\nThe language had been extinct for four centuries when an extensive corpus of documents in the logographic Tangut script were discovered in the early 20th century.\nOne of the sources used to reconstruct the Tangut language is the \"Sea of Characters\" (), a rhyme dictionary written entirely in Tangut, but with the same structure as the Chinese dictionaries.\nThe dictionary consists of one volume each for the Tangut level and rising tones, with a third volume of \"mixed category\" characters, whose significance is unclear.\nAs with the Chinese dictionaries, each volume is divided into rhymes, and then into homophone groups separated by a small circle.\nThe pronunciation of the first Tangut character in each homophone group is given by a \"fanqie\" formula using a pair of Tangut characters.\nMikhail Sofronov applied Chen Li's method to these \"fanqie\" to construct the system of Tangut initials and finals.\n\n\nFootnotes\nWorks cited\n\n\n"}

Green bibliography\n\nThis is a complete bibliography by English space opera and fantasy author Simon R. Green\n\nMost of Green's works take place within the same fictional realm, encompassing multiple realities which characters inhabit, or in some cases move between. Although cross-series use of characters or settings is frequently limited to passing mentions or brief cameo appearances, a number of Green's stories have prominently featured characters from other works in a manner that is significant to the plot. Despite this, Green's works can, with some exceptions, be separated into several distinct series and standalone novels.\n\n\nThe \"Deathstalker\" series is partly a parody of the usual space opera of the 1950s, told with sovereign disregard of the rules of probability, while being at the same time extremely bloodthirsty.\n\n\nThis series focuses on characters and events in the northern areas of the Low Kingdoms, the same kingdom which encompasses the southern city of Haven (the setting of the Hawk and Fisher series). It largely deals with the events and aftermath of the Demon War, focusing on multiple characters and plot arcs. The series serves as a companion to the \"Hawk and Fisher\" series, \"Blue Moon Rising\" taking place before the first \"Hawk and Fisher\" novel, and \"Beyond the Blue Moon\" being a followup to both \"Blue Moon Rising\" and the \"Hawk and Fisher\" series as a whole.\n\n\nThe Ghostfinders of the Carnacki Institute are here to \"Do Something\" about ghosts, and live by the motto \"We don't take any shit from the Hereafter\". This series follows a team of three Ghostfinders: the leader, JC Chance, who was touched by something from Outside in a recent case and is still trying to determine what all that means; Melody Chambers, girl geek and computer expert; and \"Happy\" Jack Palmer, Class Eleven telepath and official gloomy bugger. They are joined by JC's ghost girlfriend, Kim. JC's motley crew is now considered an \"A Team\" at the Institute, and are slowly putting pieces together of a greater threat facing humanity. The Ghost Finders series was ended when the sixth book was released in August 2015.\n\nThe Ghostfinders series takes place in the same world as the Nightside, Secret Histories, and various other Simon R. Green novels, with frequent references to characters and places between them.\n\n\nHawk and Fisher are a husband and wife team on the City Guard, an order which functions rather like a modern police force in a fantasy world of mixed Medieval, Renaissance, and Industrial Revolution stylings. They live in the port city of Haven, a city-state so corrupt that they can justly make the claim of being the only guards who have never taken a bribe or looked the other direction. They deal with everything from pickpockets to wide-scale destructive magic.\n\n\nIshmael Jones is someone who cannot afford to be noticed, someone who lives under the radar, who drives on the dark side of the road. He is employed to search out secrets, investigate mysteries and shine a light in dark places. Sometimes he kills people.\n\n\nA series of fantasy novels centering on the protagonist, John Taylor, and based in the \"Nightside\", a hidden area within London in which magic and advanced technology exist. This series also ties into the Hawk and Fisher series (i.e. mentioning the Street of the Gods, a prominent setting in the second and third novellas, \"Winner Take All\" and \"God Killer\"). Indeed, Hawk and Fisher appear drinking at Strangefellows Pub in the Nightside as an unnamed but clearly recognizable couple in \"A Hard Day's Knight\", and the Deathstalker series is often referenced: Haceldama, Hadenmen, and the Darkvoid Device are all mentioned in passing. Razor Eddie, Punk God of the Straight Razor, is rumored to have gone to the Street of the Gods to make a deal with some unknown deity for all the evil he had done, and came back changed. The Nightside series was completed when the twelfth book was released in January 2012.\n\n\nThis book series was supposed to be a trilogy, but due to the great popularity of the books Green decided to continue with the series, until finally ending it with \"Night Fall\". Being all from the same universe, the \"Deathstalker\" series has had a member of the Deathstalker family in the \"Secret Histories\" novel. Along with this comes a meeting with John Taylor, a cameo appearance of Walker (both from the \"Nightside\" series), and an appearance of the Carnacki Institute's boss (from the \"Ghost Finders\" series).\n\n\nSet in the \"Deathstalker\" universe. \"Mistworld\" tells the tale of the Empire's attack on the free planet of Mistworld, haven of outlaws and rebels, using Typhoid Mary. \"Ghostworld\" introduces Captain Silence and his crew as they respond to an emergency on the (supposedly) dead planet of Unseeli. \"Hellworld\" finds Captain Hunter and his scouts stranded on a nightmarish planet.\n\nAll three novellas either introduce characters that later appear in the main \"Deathstalker\" epic series, or concern events that are later referred to in the main \"Deathstalker\" epic series.\n\n\nThe \"Shadows Fall\" novel takes place in the same world as the \"Nightside\" series and is mentioned as a destination via subway in several of the \"Nightside\" novels. Characters mentioned in the \"Shadows Fall\" novel have appeared in the \"Nightside\" including Father Time, Bruin Bear, and Sea Goat as well as the building Time Tower, which is the residence of Father Time.\n\n\nAn audio version of \"Drinking Midnight Wine\" was released in 2013, read by English actor Dikran Tulaine.\n\nGreen plans to release all his short stories in two separate anthologies. The second will be a collection of Nightside shorts featuring a new novella, and the first anthology will contain his other works, also including a new novella.\n\nThe first anthology, \"Tales from the Hidden World\", was released on 8 July 2014. It includes a new \"Secret Histories\" novella, \"Question of Solace\". It includes all of Green's short work not set in the Nightside.\n"}

The clubs were named after the 17th-century historian John Spalding.\n\nThe original club was founded by Joseph Robertson (1810–1866) in 1839, and included among its members Cosmo Innes and John Stuart. Stuart served as secretary and was editor of many of the works published. Thirty-eight quarto volumes appeared in the club's main numbered series, as well as another six volumes uniform with but not part of that series. Seventeen of these volumes were edited by John Stuart: his more important works included \"Sculptured Stones of Scotland\" (1856 and 1867), a highly valued work of antiquarian reference; and \"The Book of Deer\" (1869), an edition of an important manuscript Gospel Book held at one time at the abbey of Deer. The club ceased to be active after 1870. \n\nThe New Spalding Club was founded at Aberdeen in 1886. Its founders included Alexander Forbes Irvine FRSE. It published forty-five volumes in its numbered series, and another seven uniform with but not part of that series. Its last volume appeared in 1924.

{"id": "9958345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9958345", "title": "Ticket (admission)", "text": "Ticket (admission)\n\nA ticket is a voucher that indicates that an individual is entitled to admission to an event or establishment such as a theatre, amusement park or tourist attraction, or has a right to travel on a vehicle, such as with an airline ticket, bus ticket or train ticket. An individual typically pays for a ticket, but it may be free of charge. A ticket may serve simply as proof of entitlement or reservation. A ticket may be valid for any seat (\"free seating\") or for a specific one (\"allocated seating\").\n\nMembers of the public can buy a ticket at a ticket window or counter, called a box office in the entertainment industry (this term is also used for the total receipts). The ticket check may also be there, or it may be separate. Tickets may also be available from resellers, which typically are commercial enterprises that purchase tickets in bulk, and resell them to members of the public, adding a surcharge. Consumers buy from resellers for reasons of convenience and availability. The convenience factor relates to being able to obtain tickets locally, and also being able to make alternate selections on the spot if the preferred performance is not available. The availability factor relates to the fact that all tickets may have been sold out at the box office, requiring the purchaser to either obtain tickets from the reseller, or not to see the show (or at least not see the particular performance of choice).\n\nSometimes, for some train journeys, both free or allocated seating are available, with an increased charge for a reserved seat. A passenger with a free seating ticket in a train carries the risk of having to stand. In a cinema a free seating ticket means that a seat is guaranteed, just not a specific one.\n\nPaper or card is generally used, although plastic may be used instead for durability. Some have a barcode or magnetic stripe for keeping simple data stored on them, higher end ones use chips to store more data and prevent counterfeiting.\n\nA paper ticket often is perforated so it can be separated into two parts, one (the ticket stub) to be kept by the customer, and one to be kept by the ticket controller. Whether or not one can leave and reenter with the customer part only varies. It may not be allowed to avoid subsequent use of one ticket by multiple people, or even simultaneous use by giving the ticket to someone before the ticket check (if this is physically possible), but it may also be allowed, ex: in a movie theatre to buy, during a movie, a snack or drink before the ticket check and reenter.\n\nTickets may be printed in advance, or fully or partly printed when issued, or it may be a printed form that is completed in handwriting (ex: by a train conductor who does not carry a ticket machine, but just a supply of forms and a pen).\n\nCounterfeit tickets are a problem at high-priced concerts and other events, so holograms are used on tickets for the Olympic Games, Super Bowl, FIFA World Cup and other high-profile events.\n\nThe fraudulent practice of passing-back a ticket can be overcome by making the ticket in the form of a tamper-proof wristband.\n\nWhen paying online for admission one may get a code, or a ticket that can be printed out. At the premises, it is made sure that the same right of admission is not used twice.\n\nInternet ticket fraud has become widespread, with authentic-looking but fake ticket websites taking customers' money but not delivering the tickets, notably for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games (through websites not based in China).\n\nFree tickets are applied in virtual queueing. In a place where one has to wait one's turn, there may be the system that one takes a ticket with a number from a dispenser. This system is usually found in hospitals and surgeries, and at offices where many people visit, like town halls, social security offices, labor exchanges, or post offices.\n\nAnother form of virtual queuing is where the ticket carries a time-slot on it, rather than just a sequentially incremented number. This type of ticket would allow someone to do other things and then return for a roller-coaster ride, for example, without having to actually stand and wait in line.\n\nA coach ticket is a document created by a coach operator or a travel agent to confirm that an individual has purchased a seat on a coach. This document is then used to obtain travel on the operators coach fleet. Only with this ticket is the passenger allowed to board the coach.\n\nA paper ticket is only good for the coach operator for which it was purchased. Usually the paper ticket is for a specific journey. It is sometimes possible to purchase an 'open' ticket which allows travel on any coach between the destinations listed on the ticket. The cost for doing this is greater than a ticket for a specific journey.\n\nSome tickets are refundable. However the lower cost tickets are usually not refundable and may carry many additional restrictions.\nIt is now common for a traveller to print out tickets online and use these on coaches instead of having tickets sent to them in the traditional way. Many coach operators use this system to save costs; some allow a text from the operator to act as a ticket with a unique reference number. Bus tickets are similar.\n\nA pass is a special ticket, representing some subscription, in particular for unlimited use of a service or collection of services. Sometimes the pass replaces the tickets, sometimes it entitles the holder to free tickets. In the latter case, typically both the pass and the ticket has to be shown at the ticket check.\n\nAlternatively, there is the discount pass, for services such as those above: for a fee per unit time (or as a benefit on other grounds) one gets a discount on each purchase. Alternatively, a multi-use ticket (either valid a limited time, or indefinitely) may provide a discount. For example, a pass for entering a cinema 6 times within a year may cost the price of 4 or 5 tickets. A multi-use ticket may or may not be personal. If not, there may be a limitation to the number of people who can use the same multi-use ticket at the same time.\n\n"}

{"id": "16290254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16290254", "title": "Witch trials in the early modern period", "text": "Witch trials in the early modern period\n\nThe period of witch trials in Early Modern Europe, also called the Burning Times, were a widespread moral panic suggesting that malevolent Satanic witches were operating as an organized threat to Christendom during the 16th to 18th centuries. Those accused of witchcraft were portrayed as being worshippers of the Devil, who engaged in such acts as malevolent sorcery at meetings known as Witches' Sabbaths. Many people were subsequently accused of being witches, and were put on trial for the crime, with varying punishments being applicable in different regions and at different times. More than 75% of those executed in Europe between 1580 and 1630 were women.\n\nThough some of the earliest trials are from the Late Medieval period following Pope Innocent VIII's issue of the Summis desiderantes affectibus, which recognized the existence of witches and gave full papal approval for the inquisition to move against witches, the peak of witch hunting was during the European wars of religion, climaxing from 1580 to 1630. The witch hunts declined in the early 18th century, culminating with the British Witchcraft Act of 1735, but there were sporadic witch-trials during the second half of the 18th century, the last known dating to 1782 (though a prosecution was commenced in Tennessee as recently as 1833).\n\nAn estimated total of 30,000-60,000 people were executed during the witch trials. Among the best known of these trials were the Scottish North Berwick witch trials, Swedish Torsåker witch trials and the American Salem witch trials. Among the largest and most notable were the Trier witch trials (1581–1593), the Fulda witch trials (1603–1606), the Würzburg witch trial (1626–1631) and the Bamberg witch trials (1626–1631).\n\nThe sociological causes of the witch-hunts have long been debated. Mainstream historiography sees the reason for the witch craze in a complex interplay of various factors that mark the early modern period, including the religious sectarianism in the wake of the Reformation, besides other religious, societal, economic and climatic factors.\n\nThe witch-trials emerged in the 16th century out of the practices surrounding the persecution of heresy in the medieval period, although they reached their peak during the Wars of Religion and on the heels of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nWhile belief in witches and preternatural evil were widespread in pre-Christian Europe, the influence of the Church in the early medieval era resulted in the revocation of these laws in many places, bringing an end to traditional pagan witch hunts. Throughout the medieval era mainstream Christian teaching had denied the existence of witches and witchcraft, condemning it as pagan superstition. However, Christian influence on popular beliefs in witches and \"maleficium\" (harm committed by magic) failed to entirely eradicate folk belief in witches.\n\nThe work of Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century was instrumental in developing the new theology which would give rise to the witch hunts. Because sorcery was judged by secular courts, it was not until \"maleficium\" was identified with heresy that theological trials for witchcraft could commence. This was accompanied by a number of developments in common Christian belief, i.e. the recognition of the existence of witchcraft as a form of Satanic influence, and its classification as a heresy. As Renaissance occultism gained traction among the educated classes, the belief in witchcraft, which in the medieval period had been part of the folk religion of the uneducated rural population, was incorporated into an increasingly comprehensive theology of Satan as the ultimate source of all \"maleficium\".\n\nThese changes in the doctrinal shift were completed in the mid 15th century, specifically in the wake of the Council of Basel and centered on the Duchy of Savoy in the western Alps, leading to an early series of witch trials by both secular and ecclesiastical courts in the second half of the 15th century.\n\n\"Malleus Maleficarum\", the 1485 treatise by Henricus Institoris, met initial resistance in some areas while elsewhere in Europe only the first wave of the new witch trials was experienced in the latter half of the 16th century.\n\nEarly Modern Europe and its North American colonies were replete with a belief in the reality of magic and witchcraft. Belief in the witch, an individual who practiced malevolent magic, was not new to Modern Europe. Witches had appeared both in literature – most prominently with the character of Circe in Homer's \"Odyssey\" – and in reality, with many individuals writing curses on leaden tablets across the Roman Empire. In parts of Early Medieval Europe there was a widespread and long-lasting belief in witches who rode out with a goddess, varyingly known as Diana, Herodias, Holda, or Perchta; in the \"Canon Episcopi\", the Roman Catholic Church maintained that cavalcade did not really happen, and that instead it was an erroneous superstition caused by the Devil.\n\nMany Early Modern communities contained professional or semi-professional practitioners of folk magic; in England they were known as \"cunning folk\" although other terms were used elsewhere. They were believed to be able to cure disease, counter malevolent sorcery, identify enemies, foretell the future, and locate treasure and lost property, and would offer their services in these areas for a fee. In contrast to this low magic was the high magic practiced by learned men of the Renaissance. Advocated by the likes of Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola, this Renaissance high magic was influenced by ancient philosophies like Neoplatonism and Hermeticism and was theoretically complex, seeing the practice of magic as part of a wider spiritual system.\n\nHistorians like Carlo Ginzburg and Éva Pócs have suggested that various beliefs pertaining to magic and witchcraft in Early Modern Europe represented a survival of shamanistic pre-Christian beliefs about visionary journeys. For instance, Emma Wilby has argued that the Early Modern accounts of familiar spirits represent a survival of pre-Christian animism, and has drawn comparisons between alleged witches' Sabbath journeys and the spirit-visions found in ethnographically-recorded shamanic societies in Siberia and North America.\n\nIt was also during the Medieval period that the concept of Satan, the Biblical Devil, began to develop into a more threatening form in the minds of people than earlier. Around the year 1000, when there were increasing fears that the end of the world would soon come in Christendom, the idea of the Devil had become prominent, with many believing that his activities on Earth would soon begin appearing. Whilst in earlier centuries there had been no set depiction of the Devil, it was also around this time that he began to develop the stereotypical image of being animal-like, or even in some cases an animal himself. In particular, he was often viewed as a goat, or as a human with goat-like features, such as horns, hooves and a tail. Equally, the concepts of demons began to become more prominent, in particular the idea that male demons known as incubi, and female ones known as succubi, would roam the Earth and have sexual intercourse with humans. As Thurston noted, \"By about 1200, it would have been difficult to be a Christian and not frequently hear of the devil  ... [and] by 1500 scenes of the devil were commonplace in the new cathedrals and small parish churches that had sprung up in many regions.\" The field of demonology had emerged in Medieval Christendom as certain members of the clergy began to focus in particular on the actions of demons in the world.\n\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, the concept of the witch in Christendom underwent a relatively radical change. No longer were they viewed as sorcerers who had been deceived by the Devil into practicing magic that went against the powers of God, as earlier Church leaders like Saint Augustine of Hippo had stated. Instead, they became the all-out malevolent Devil-worshiper, who had made a pact with him in which they had to renounce Christianity and devote themselves to Satanism. As a part of this, they gained new, supernatural powers that enabled them to work magic, which they would use against Christians. It was believed that they would fly to their nocturnal meetings, known as the Witches' Sabbath, where they would have sexual intercourse with demons. On their death, the witches' souls, which then belonged to the Devil, subsequently went to Hell.\n\nFor many educated Christians in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including theologians and judges, there was a great concern about the idea that witches were in league with the Devil. Conversely, it appears that the idea of the witch as Satanist was far less prevalent among the peasantry and popular classes, who were far more concerned about the potential harm that they could receive from witches than from where the witches gained their magical power.\n\nWhile the witch trials only really began in the 15th century, with the start of the early modern period, many of their causes had been developing during the previous centuries, with the prosecution of heresy by the Medieval Inquisition during the late twelfth and the thirteenth centuries, and during the Late Medieval period, during which the idea of witchcraft or sorcery gradually changed and adapted. The inquisition had the office of protecting Christians against the \"internal\" threat of heresy (as opposed to \"external\" military threats such as those of the Vikings, the Mongols, and the Saracens or Turks).\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages, a number of heretical Christian groups, such as the Cathars and the Knights Templar had been accused of performing such anti-Christian activities as Satanism, sodomy and malevolent sorcery in France. While the nucleus of the early modern \"witch craze\" would turn out to be popular superstition in the Western Alps, reinforced by theological rationale developed at or following the Council of Basel of the 1430s, what has been called \"the first real witch trial in Europe,\" the accusation of Alice Kyteler in 1324, occurred in 14th-century Ireland, during the turmoils associated with the decline of Norman control.\n\nThurston (2001) speaks of a shift in Christian society from a \"relatively open and tolerant\" attitude to that of a \"persecuting society\" taking an aggressive stance towards minorities characterized as Jews, heretics (such as Cathars and Waldensians), lepers or homosexuals, often associated with conspiracy theories assuming a concerted effort on the part of diabolical forces to weaken and destroy Christianity, indeed \"the idea became popular that one or more vast conspiracies were trying to destroy Christianity from within.\" An important turning-point was the Black Death of 1348–1350, which killed a large percentage of the European population, and which many Christians believed had been caused by their enemies. The catalog of typical charges that would later be leveled at witches, of spreading diseases, committing orgies (sometimes incestuous), cannibalizing children, and following Satanism, emerged during the 14th century as crimes attributed to heretics and Jews.\n\nWitchcraft had not been considered a heresy during the High Medieval period. Indeed, since the Council of Paderborn of 785, the belief in the possibility of witchcraft itself was considered heretical. While witch-hunts only became common after 1400, an important legal step that would make this development possible occurred in 1326, when Pope John XXII authorized the inquisition to prosecute witchcraft as a type of heresy.\n\nThe anti-semitic sentiment prevalent in the Medieval era would also influence the later witch trials, with the alleged witches' meetings being termed \"sabbaths\" and \"synagogues\".\n\nThe historian Richard Kieckhefer suggested that the late medieval trials \"paved the way for more dramatic prosecutions to come\". There had been a growth in the number of sorcery trials in Europe during the fourteenth century. Kieckhefer noted that the trials of the fifteenth century were \"different in kind from most of the preceding cases.\" As historians Geoffrey Scarre and John Callow highlighted, the trials of demonic witches was \"an early modern and not a medieval phenomenon\".\n\nBy the late 14th century, a number of \"witch hunters\" began to publish books on the topic, including Nicholas Eymeric, the inquisitor in Aragon and Avignon, who published the \"Directorium Inquisitorum\" in 1376.\n\nThe earliest known witch trials in which the accused were associated with the fully developed stereotype of the demonic witch was in the Valais witch trials of 1428, which took place in communities of the Western Alps, in what were at the time Burgundy and Savoy. Here, the cause of eliminating the supposed Satanic witches from society was taken up by a number of individuals; Claude Tholosan for instance had tried over two hundred people accusing them of witchcraft in Briançon, Dauphiné by 1420.\n\nSoon, the idea of identifying and prosecuting witches spread throughout the neighboring areas of northern Italy, Switzerland and southern Germany, and it was at Basel that the Council of Basel assembled from 1431 to 1437. This Church Council, which had been attended by such anti-witchcraft figures as Johann Nider and Martin Le Franc, helped to standardize the stereotype of the Satanic witch that would be propagated throughout the rest of the trials. Men who had been at the Council of Basel went on to spread the ideas regarding demonic witchcraft throughout other parts of Europe in the ensuing years.\n\nThe development of the printing press allowed for a number of books to be published which outlined the existence of demonic witchcraft and described how to deal with it; circulating throughout the literate sectors of Western Europe, they stimulated increased interest in the subject and advocated a coherent intellectual response to it. Works published in this vein included Johannes Nider's \"Formicarius\" (c.1435), the \"Errores Gazariorum\" (c.1450), Nicholas Jacquier's \"Flagellum Haereticorum Fascinariorum\" (1450s), Ulrich Molitor's \"De Lamiis\" (1489), and most famously Heinrich Kramer's \"Malleus Malificarum\" (\"The Hammer of the Witches,\" 1487). At the same time, printing allowed fictional stories about witches and magicians to be spread throughout the continent, such as the tales of Dr Faustus, thereby reinforcing the belief in malevolent practitioners of magic who interacted with the Devil and his demons.\n\nOn December 5, 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued the \"Summis desiderantes affectibus\", a papal bull in which he recognized the existence of witches and gave full papal approval for the inquisition to move against witches. In the bull, which is sometimes referred to as the \"Witch-Bull of 1484\", the witches were explicitly accused of having \"slain infants yet in the mother's womb\" (abortion) and of \"hindering men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving\" (contraception).\n\nBefore the main period of witch hunts, men and women were equally accused of witchcraft and their social status was not as important as it would become. By the time of the hunts, 4 out of every 5 victims were women (usually lower class and elderly) in places like England, with that number being reported jumping up to as high as 90% in other countries. While men did make up a sizable minority of those accused, some scholars have pointed out that many of the men accused were related to women who had already been accused.\n\nThe height of the European trials was between 1560 and 1630, with the large hunts first beginning in 1609. During this period, the biggest witch trials were held in Europe, notably the Trier witch trials (1581–1593), the Fulda witch trials (1603–1606), the Basque witch trials (1609-1611), the Würzburg witch trial (1626–1631) and the Bamberg witch trials (1626–1631).\n\nIn 1590, the North Berwick witch trials occurred in Scotland, and were of particular note as the king, James VI, became involved himself. James had developed a fear that witches planned to kill him after he suffered from storms whilst traveling to Denmark in order to claim his bride, Anne, earlier that year. Returning to Scotland, the king heard of trials that were occurring in North Berwick and ordered the suspects to be brought to him—he subsequently believed that a nobleman, Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects, and in 1597 he wrote a book about the menace that witches posed to society entitled \"Daemonologie\".\n\nGary Foxcroft in 2014 had an article appear in the World Policy Journal suggesting that a minor change King James made to the Bible justified \"horrific human rights violations and fuel[ed] the epidemic of witchcraft accusations and persecution across the globe.\". The change involved changing Exodus 22:18 from \"do not suffer a poisoner to live\" to \"do not suffer a witch to live.\" The veracity of this claim has been questioned. A translation that dates before that of the King James version contradicts Foxcroft's claim. The Geneva Bible which precedes the King James version by 51 years includes the term \"witch\" in Exodus 22:18 (\"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\")\n\nEven throughout the 16th century, there had been isolated expressions of scepticism regarding the trial, increasing throughout the 17th century. In 1635, the Roman Inquisition acknowledged that it had \"found scarcely one trial conducted legally\". In the middle of the 17th century, the difficulty in proving witchcraft according to legal process contributed to the councilors of Rothenburg (German), following advice to treat witchcraft cases with caution.\n\nWhilst the witch trials had begun to fade out across much of Europe by the mid-17th century, they continued on the fringes of Europe and in the American Colonies. In the Nordic countries, the late 17th century saw the peak of the trials in a number of areas: the Torsåker witch trials of Sweden (1674), where 71 people were executed for witchcraft in a single day, the peak of witch hunting in Swedish Finland, and the Salzburg witch trials in Austria (where 139 people were executed from 1675–1690).\n\nThe 1692 Salem witch trials were a brief outburst of witch hysteria in the New World while the practice was waning in Europe. In the 1690s Winifred King Benham and her daughter Winifred were thrice tried for witchcraft in Wallingford, Connecticut, the last of such trials in New England. While found innocent, they were compelled to leave Wallingford to settle in Staten Island, New York. In 1706 Grace Sherwood of Virginia was tried by ducking and jailed for allegedly being a witch.\n\nThe 18th century witnessed increased urbanization and technological development in Europe, giving European Early Modern society an increased belief in its own abilities to fashion the world and leading to the decrease in the belief of invisible forces affecting humanity. Belief that Satan interfered in human affairs directly was also waning and the belief in demons became rare among the educated elites, thus the belief in demonic witchcraft eroded with it. Rationalist skeptics of the trials came to the opinion that the use of torture had resulted in erroneous testimony.\n\nIn France, scholars have found that with increased fiscal capacity and a stronger central government, the witchcraft accusations began to decline. The witch trials that occurred there were symptomatic of a weak legal system and \"witches were most likely to be tried and convicted in regions where magistrates departed from established legal statutes.\" \n\nDuring the early 18th century, the practice subsided. Jane Wenham was among the last subjects of a typical witch trial in England in 1712, but was pardoned after her conviction and set free. The last execution for witchcraft in England took place in 1716, when Mary Hicks and her daughter Elizabeth were hanged. Janet Horne was executed for witchcraft in Scotland in 1727. The Witchcraft Act 1735 put an end of the traditional form of witchcraft as a legal offense in Britain. Those accused under the new act were restricted to those that pretended to be able to conjure spirits (generally being the most dubious professional fortune tellers and mediums), and punishment was light.\n\nIn Austria, Maria Theresa outlawed witch-burning and torture in the late 18th century (the last capital trial, that of Maria Pauer occurred in 1750 in Salzburg, which was then outside the Austrian domain).\n\nWhile the educated elites had largely abandoned their belief in the reality of witchcraft, this belief remained widespread in popular culture. From this point on, it was very rare for an accused witch to undergo a judicial process and be threatened with execution, but there was still a danger from popular justice and lynch mobs. The death of Ruth Osborne is an example of one such case that occurred in 1751. The last person in Germany to be executed for witchcraft was fifteen-year-old Veronika Zeritschin, who was beheaded and then burned on April 2, 1756 in Landshut.\n\nIn the later 18th century, witchcraft had ceased to be considered a criminal offense throughout Europe, but there are a number of cases which were not technically witch trials but are suspected to have involved belief in witches at least behind the scenes. Thus, in 1782, Anna Göldi was executed in Glarus, Switzerland, officially for the killing of her infant – a ruling at the time widely denounced throughout Switzerland and Germany as judicial murder. Like Anna Göldi, Barbara Zdunk was executed in 1811 in Prussia not technically for witchcraft but for arson. In Poland, the Doruchów witch trial occurred in 1783 and the execution of two additional women for sorcery in 1793, tried by a legal court but with dubious legitimacy.\n\nDespite the official ending of the trials for Satanic witchcraft, there would still be occasional unofficial killings of those accused in parts of Europe, such as was seen in the cases of Anna Klemens in Denmark (1800), Krystyna Ceynowa in Poland (1836), and Dummy, the Witch of Sible Hedingham in England (1863). In France, there was sporadic violence and even murder in the 1830s, with one woman reportedly burnt in a village square in Nord.\n\nIn the 1830s a prosecution for witchcraft was commenced against a man in Fentress County, Tennessee named either Joseph or William Stout, based upon his alleged influence over the health of a young woman. The case against the supposed witch was dismissed upon the failure of the alleged victim, who had sworn out a warrant against him, to appear for the trial. However, some of his other accusers were convicted on criminal charges for their part in the matter, and various libel actions were brought.\n\nIn 1895, Bridget Cleary was beaten and burned to death by her husband in Ireland because he suspected that fairies had taken the real Bridget and replaced her with a witch.\n\nThe persecution of those believed to perform malevolent sorcery against their neighbors continued into the 20th century. In 1997 two Russian farmers killed a woman and injured five other members of her family after believing that they had used folk magic against them. It has been reported that more than 3,000 people were killed by lynch mobs in Tanzania between 2005 and 2011 for allegedly being witches.\n\nThere were extensive efforts to root out the supposed influence of Satan by various measures aimed at the people who were accused of being servants of Satan. To a lesser degree, animals were also targeted for prosecution (see animal trial). People suspected of being \"possessed by Satan\" were put on trial. On the other hand, the church also attempted to extirpate the superstitious belief in witchcraft and sorcery, considering it as fraud in most cases.\n\nMost historians agree that the majority of those persecuted in these witch trials were innocent of any involvement in Devil worship., casting doubt on the veracity of claims made by many historians working in the field.\nGeoffrey Scarre and John Callow erroneously thought it \"without doubt\" that some of those accused in the trials had been guilty of employing magic in an attempt to harm their enemies, and were thus genuinely guilty of witchcraft.\n\nMost of the trials were not motivated by stupidity or a love of violence, but of a belief that it was the morally appropriate course of action for people to take; while some of those carrying out the trials appeared to exhibit sadism, most appear to have acted \"from a spirit of duty and a concern for the public welfare.\"\nScarre and Callow described the trials as \"a frightning example of how morally motivated action can lead to massive suffering\". Lecky argues there was a large amount of impartial evidence demonstrating the existence of witchcraft and that views only changed when the concept of evil spirits came under skepticism in general.\n\nThere were many regional differences in the manner in which the witch trials occurred. The trials themselves emerged sporadically, flaring up in some areas while neighbouring areas remained largely unaffected. In general, homogeneously Catholic states, such as Spain and Italy, remained largely unaffected, while religiously divided countries like the Holy Roman Empire or France were more affected.\n\nOne of the areas that witnessed the largest number of panics, trials, and executions were the German-language of the Holy Roman Empire. Nevertheless, there were regional variations here, with relatively few executions in southern Bavaria and the Lower Rhine area.\nOn the whole the trials were less severe in neighbouring France, although there was regional variation domestically, with the Pyrenees, Languedoc, the Alps and the North East being particularly heavily affected by the trials. There were also large trials in Lorraine and Franche-Comté, although these regions would only be permanently annexed by France after 1660. The situation differed in Southern Europe, with few trials taking place in either Spain or Italy. When they did occur in these nations, it was in the northern regions such as Spain's Basque Country; being close to neighbouring countries, these areas were more open to foreign influences and had a weaker central authority.\n\nThere was much regional variation within the British Isles. In Ireland, there were few trials, and those that did take place lacked the demonic elements present elsewhere on the continent. Similarly, the trials in England were atypical of Europe as a whole, for the emphasis of the charges was normally on the practice of malevolent magic rather than contact with the Devil, while the concept of witches' familiars played a key role, which was conversely largely absent from the continental trial accounts. North of the border, in Scotland, witch trials were far more numerous and resulted in far more executions than in England, having far more in common with the trials of France and Germany. Among the British settlements in New England, witch trials were very rare and not a feature of typical Early Modern life.\n\nA country's government and legal system often made a major difference. England, for instance, had and has a long history of strong judicial centralization and therefore regulations prevented easy convictions, except for periods such as the English Civil War and the periods of Witch-hunting; Scotland, on the other hand, lacked the strong central government that England had and authorities had greater trouble controlling local justice or even contributed to the problem. During the time of the Witch Hunts, Germany was a patchwork of more than 300 autonomous territories and was highly decentralized politically, therefore making Germany highly vulnerable to massive witch hunts that spun out of control in the absence of judicial regulations.\n\nThere are particularly important differences between the English and continental witch-hunting traditions. The checks and balances inherent in the English jury system, which required a 23-strong body (the grand jury) to indict and a 12-strong one (the petit jury) to convict, always had a restraining effect on prosecutions. Another restraining influence was its relatively rare use of torture: the country formally permitted it only when authorized by the monarch, and no more than 81 torture warrants were issued (for all offenses) throughout English history. Continental European courts, while varying from region to region, tended to concentrate power in individual judges and place far more reliance on torture. The significance of the institutional difference is most clearly established by a comparison of the witch-hunts of England and Scotland, for the death toll inflicted by the courts north of the border always dwarfed that of England. It is also apparent from an episode of English history during the early 1640s, when the Civil War resulted in the suspension of jury courts for three years. Several freelance witch-hunters emerged during this period, the most notorious of whom was Matthew Hopkins, who emerged from East Anglia and proclaimed himself \"Witchfinder General\".\n\nItaly saw much less witchcraft accusation, and even fewer cases where witch trials ended in execution. In 1542, the establishment of the Roman Inquisition effectively retrained secular courts under its influence from liberal application of torture and execution. The methodological Instructio, which served as an \"appropriate\" manual for witch hunting, cautioned against hasty convictions and careless executions of the accused. In contrast with other parts of Europe, trials the Venetian Holy Office never saw conviction for the crime of malevolent witchcraft, or \"maleficio\". Because the notion of diabolical cults was not credible to neither popular culture nor inquisitorial theology, mass accusations and belief in Witches' Sabbath never took root in areas under inquisitorial influence.\n\nSpain also had a tighter grip on is governmental institutions and thus saw far less convictions in witchcraft. Rodney Stark notes the Inquisition in Spain gained a strong hold to combat the mob mentality regarding the prosecution of witches and to provided fair trials for those accused. Brian Levack also notes that even during the high point of the witch hunts in Spain, only eleven of the nineteen hundred accused of witchcraft were condemned. Levack also notes of those nineteen hundred accused, most were never formally charged. Stark also points at that the Inquisition in Spain was often more lenient than secular courts and would often step in to reverse their convictions. Stark also noted that in Spain the punishment for a first-time offenses were often light, if any at all. Oftentimes, the Inquisitors would just have the offender reconcile with the Church. It was only if this reconciliation was refused was the \"witch\" sentenced to death.\n\nBecause The Holy Office viewed witchcraft as a theological violation toward Catholic doctrines, torture was used sparingly, with the purpose of making subjects renounce their errors and thus be reintegrated back into Catholic society. This means there was much less potential to name other associates, thus decreasing the chance of mass accusation.\n\nThe majority of those accused were from the lower economic classes in European society, although, in times of severe panic, wealthier and high ranking individuals were accused as well, including priests, judges and, in very rare cases, members of the nobility.\nOn the basis of this evidence, Scarre and Callow asserted that the \"typical witch was the wife or widow of an agricultural labourer or small tenant farmer, and she was well known for a quarrelsome and aggressive nature.\"\n\nIn various instances, it was men rather than women who constituted the majority of the accused. For instance, in Iceland 92% of the accused were men, and in Estonia 60% of the accused victims were male, mainly middle-aged or elderly married peasants, and known healers or sorcerers. In the witch trials of Moscow, Russia, two-thirds of those accused were male.\n\nAlthough it was far more common for them to be accusers rather than accused, children were sometimes put on trial for witchcraft. For instance, during the Würzburg trials of 1629, children made up 60% of those accused, although this had reduced to 17% by the end of the year. Several decades later, in the late 1660s, children in Mora, Sweden publicly claimed that adults had taken them to the witches' Sabbath. As a result, fifteen boys over the age of 16 were executed, while forty younger children were whipped.\n\nVarious acts of torture were used against accused witches to coerce confessions and cause them to name their co-conspirators. The torture of witches began to increase in frequency after 1468 when the Pope declared witchcraft to be \"crimen exceptum\" and thereby removed all legal limits on the application of torture in cases where evidence was difficult to find.\n\nIn Italy, an accused witch was deprived of sleep for periods up to forty hours. This technique was also used in England, but without a limitation on time. Sexual humiliation was used, such as forced sitting on red-hot stools with the claim that the accused woman would not perform sexual acts with the devil. In most cases, those who endured the torture without confessing were released.\n\nThe use of torture has been identified as a key factor in converting the trial of one accused witch into a wider social panic, as those being tortured were more likely to accuse a wide array of other local individuals of also being witches.\n\nA variety of different punishments were employed for those found guilty of witchcraft, including imprisonment, flogging, fines, or exile.\nThe Old Testament's book of states, \"Thou shalt not permit a sorceress to live\". Many faced capital punishment for witchcraft, either by burning at the stake, hanging, or beheading. Similarly, in New England, people convicted of witchcraft were hanged.\n\nThe scholarly consensus on the total number of executions for witchcraft ranges from 40,000-60,000 (not including unofficial lynchings of accused witches, which went unrecorded but are nevertheless believed to have been somewhat rare in the Early Modern period). \nIt would also have been the case that various individuals would have died as a result of the unsanitary conditions of their imprisonment, but again this is not recorded within the number of executions.\n\nAttempts at estimating the total number of executions for witchcraft have a history going back to the end of the period of witch-hunts in the 18th century. A scholarly consensus only emerges in the second half of the 20th century, and historical estimates vary wildly depending on the method used. Early estimates tend to be highly exaggerated, as they were still part of rhetorical arguments against the persecution of witches rather than purely historical scholarship. \nNotably, a figure of nine million victims was given by Gottfried Christian Voigt in 1784 in an argument criticizing Voltaire's estimate of \"several hundred thousand\" as too low. Voigt's number has shown remarkably resilient as an influential popular myth, surviving well into the 20th century, especially in feminist and neo-pagan literature.\nIn the 19th century, some scholars were agnostic, for instance Jacob Grimm (1844) talked of \"countless\" victims and Charles Mackay (1841) named \"thousands upon thousands\". By contrast, a popular news report of 1832 cited a number of 392,000 victims \"in Great Britain alone\". \nIn the early 20th century, some scholarly estimates on the number of executions still ranged in the hundreds of thousands. The estimate was only reliably placed below 100,000 \nin scholarship of the 1970s.\n\nVarious suggestions have been made that the witch trials emerged as a response to socio-political turmoil in the Early Modern world. One form of this is that the prosecution of witches was a reaction to a disaster that had befallen the community, such as crop-failure, war, or disease. For instance, Midelfort suggested that in southwestern Germany, war and famine destabilised local communities, resulting in the witch prosecutions of the 1620s. Behringer also suggests an increase in witch prosecutions due to socio-political destabilization, stressing the Little Ice Age's effects on food shortages and the subsequent use of witches as scapegoats for consequences of climatic changes. The Little Ice Age, lasting from about 1300 to 1850, is characterized by temperatures and precipitation levels lower than the 1901-1960 average. Historians such as Wolfgang Behringer, Emily Oster, and Hartmut Lehmann argue that these cooling temperatures brought about crop-failure, war, and disease, and that witches were subsequently blamed for this turmoil. Historical temperature indexes and witch trials data indicate that, generally, as temperature decreased during this period, witch trials increased. Additionally, the peaks of witchcraft persecutions overlap with hunger crises that occurred in 1570 and 1580, the latter lasting a decade. Problematically for these theories, it has been highlighted that, in that region, the witch hunts declined during the 1630s, at a time when the communities living there were facing increased disaster as a result of plague, famine, economic collapse and the Thirty Years' War. Furthermore, this scenario would clearly not offer a universal explanation, for trials also took place in areas which were free from war, famine, or pestilence. Additionally, these theories - particularly Behringer's - have been labeled as oversimplified. Although there is evidence that the Little Ice Age and subsequent famine and disease was likely a contributing factor to increase in witch persecution, Durrant argues that one cannot make a direct link between these problems and witch persecutions in all contexts.\n\nMoreover, the average age at first marriage had gradually risen by late sixteenth century; the population had stabilized after a period of growth and availability of jobs and land had lessened. In the last decades of the century the age at marriage had climbed to averages of 25 for women and 27 for men in England and the Low Countries as more people married later or remained unmarried due to lack of money or resources and a decline in living standards, and these averages remained high for nearly two centuries and averages across Northwestern Europe had done likewise. The convents were closed during the Protestant Reformation, which displaced many nuns. Many communities saw the proportion of unmarried women climb from less than 10% to 20% and in some cases as high as 30%, whom few communities knew how to accommodate economically. Miguel (2003) argues that witch killings may be a process of eliminating the financial burdens of a family or society via elimination of the older women that need to be fed, and an increase in unmarried women would enhance this process.\n\nThe English historian Hugh Trevor-Roper advocated the idea that the witch trials emerged as part of the conflicts between Roman Catholics and Protestants in Early Modern Europe. This theory has however received little support from other experts in the subject. This is because there is little evidence that either Roman Catholics were accusing Protestants of witchcraft, or that Protestants were accusing Roman Catholics. Furthermore, the witch trials regularly occurred in regions with little or no inter-denominational strife, and which were largely religiously homogenous, such as Essex, Lowland Scotland, Geneva, Venice, and the Spanish Basque Country. There is also some evidence, particularly from the Holy Roman Empire, in which adjacent Roman Catholic and Protestant territories were exchanging information on alleged local witches, viewing them as a common threat to both. Additionally, many prosecutions were instigated not by the religious or secular authorities, but by popular demands from within the population, thus making it less likely that there were specific inter-denominational reasons behind the accusations.\n\nIn south-western Germany between 1561 and 1670 there were 480 witch trials. Of the 480 trials that took place in southwestern Germany, 317 occurred in Catholic areas, while Protestant territories accounted for 163 of them. During the period from 1561 to 1670, at least 3,229 persons were executed for witchcraft in the German Southwest. Of this number 702 were tried and executed in Protestant territories, while 2,527 were tried and executed in Catholic territories.\n\nA 2017 study in the \"Economic Journal\", examining \"more than 43,000 people tried for witchcraft across 21 European countries over a period of five-and-a-half centuries\", found that \"more intense religious-market contestation led to more intense witch-trial activity. And, compared to religious-market contestation, the factors that existing hypotheses claim were important for witch-trial activity—weather, income, and state capacity—were not.\"\n\nInspired by ethnographically recorded witch trials that anthropologists observed happening in non-European parts of the world, various historians have sought a functional explanation for the Early Modern witch trials, thereby suggesting the social functions that the trials played within their communities.\nThese studies have illustrated how accusations of witchcraft have played a role in releasing social tensions or in facilitating the termination of personal relationships that have become un-desirable to one party.\n\nUndertaking in-depth analysis of the social and cultural context of the English witch trials, Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlene showed that the accused were unpopular, anti-social, and often aggressive, known for begging from their neighbours and verbally cursing those who turned them away. In this they provided an explicitly functionalist explanation of the trials, in that they were used to eliminate anti-social members of the community.\n\nAnother theory is that the witch trials represented a method whereby the socio-economic elites used it as form of social control to consolidate their dominance over the poorer sections of the population.\n\nAnother theory, proposed by the prominent American anthropologist, Marvin Harris, in his work \"Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches\" (1973), is that the witches were scapegoats victimized by the Church and secular lords to focus and divert public furor at a time of economic dislocation: \"The practical significance of the witch mania therefore was that it shifted responsibility for the crisis of late medieval society from both Church and state to imaginary demons in human form.\" (Harris, 1973, 205) Religious and secular authorities, argues Harris, in leading the witch hunts, not only exonerated themselves but made themselves indispensable, cementing their power.\n\nAn estimated 75% to 85% of those accused in the early modern witch trials were women, and there is certainly evidence of misogyny on the part of those persecuting witches, evident from quotes such as \"[It is] not unreasonable that this scum of humanity, [witches], should be drawn chiefly from the feminine sex\" (Nicholas Rémy, c. 1595) or \"The Devil uses them so, because he knows that women love carnal pleasures, and he means to bind them to his allegiance by such agreeable provocations.\" Scholar Kurt Baschwitz in his first monography on the subject (in Dutch, 1948) mentions this aspect of the witch trials even as \"a war against old women\".\nNevertheless, it has been argued that the supposedly misogynistic agenda of works on witchcraft has been greatly exaggerated, based on the selective repetition of a few relevant passages of the \"Malleus maleficarum\". There are various reasons as to why this was the case. In Early Modern Europe, it was widely believed that women were less intelligent than men and more susceptible to sin.\nMany modern scholars argue that the witch hunts cannot be explained simplistically as an expression of male misogyny, as indeed women were frequently accused by other women,\nto the point that witch-hunts, at least at the local level of villages, have been described as having been driven primarily by \"women's quarrels\".\nEspecially at the margins of Europe, in Iceland, Finland, Estonia and Russia, the majority of those accused were male.\n\nBarstow (1994) claimed that a combination of factors, including the greater value placed on men as workers in the increasingly wage-oriented economy, and a greater fear of women as inherently evil, loaded the scales against women, even when the charges against them were identical to those against men.\nThurston (2001) saw this as a part of the general misogyny of the Late Medieval and Early Modern periods, which had increased during what he described as \"the persecuting culture\" from that which it had been in the Early Medieval.\nGunnar Heinsohn and Otto Steiger in a 1982 publication speculated that witch-hunts targeted women skilled in midwifery specifically in an attempt to extinguish knowledge about birth control and \"repopulate Europe\" after the population catastrophe of the Black Death.\n\nEarly rationalist historians interpreted the witch trials as an example of mass superstition, and thus their end in the 18th century was seen as a revival of common sense among the population. This idea did not take into account that the existence of malevolent witches fitted within the worldview of the Early Modern, with its strong divide between good and evil, and that a belief in witches was therefore \"common sense\" to Early Modern people.\n\nDuring the Prussian Kulturkampf, starting from the mid-19th century, the Roman Catholic Church was accused of being sole originator of witch hunts, the number of victims was significantly overstated with up to 9 million. According to recent research and extensive analysis of court records, it is believed that the result of persecution throughout Europe were about 40,000 to 60,000 deaths.<br>\nFrom the 1970s onward, there was a \"massive explosion of scholarly enthusiasm\" for the study of the Early Modern witch trials. This was partly because scholars from a variety of different disciplines, including sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, philosophy, philosophy of science, criminology, literary theory, and feminist theory, all began to investigate the phenomenon and brought their different insights to bear on the subject. This was accompanied by in-depth analysis of the trial records and the socio-cultural contexts on which they emerged, allowing for a far more sophisticated understanding of the trials than had previously been available.\nDuring this process, Britain and Germany established themselves as the main centres for the research of the subject. There have nevertheless been regional differences in how this has been undertaken; scholars in Britain and the United States have for instance largely neglected questions regarding how ancient ideas influenced and informed the identities of Early Modern witchcraft, something which conversely has been of great interest to a number of continental European scholars.\n<br>In 2017, the face of a woman who allegedly confessed to being a witch but who died before she could be burned, was reconstructed \n\nIn 20th-century Western society, the witch trials were used as \"a synonym for pointless persecution\", such as the Red Scare and McCarthyism in the 1950s United States.\n\nThroughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the common belief among educated sectors of the European populace was that there had never been any genuine cult of witches and that all those persecuted and executed as such had been innocent of the crime. However, at this time various scholars suggested that there had been a real cult that had been persecuted by the Christian authorities, and that it had had pre-Christian origins. The first to advance this theory was the German Professor of Criminal Law Karl Ernst Jarcke of the University of Berlin who put forward the idea in 1828; he suggested that witchcraft had been a pre-Christian German religion that had degenerated into Satanism. Jarcke's ideas were picked up by the German historian Franz Josef Mone in 1839, although he argued that the cult's origins were Greek rather than Germanic.\n\nIn 1862, the Frenchman Jules Michelet published \"La Sorciere\", in which he put forth the idea that the witches had been following a pagan religion. The theory achieved greater attention when it was taken up by the Egyptologist Margaret Murray, who published both \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\" (1921) and \"The God of the Witches\" (1931) in which she claimed that the witches had been following a pre-Christian religion which she termed \"the Witch-Cult\" and \"Ritual Witchcraft\". She claimed that this faith was devoted to a pagan Horned God and involved the celebration of four Witches' Sabbaths each year: Halloween, Imbolc, Beltane and Lughnasadh. However, the majority of scholarly reviews of Murray's work produced at the time were largely critical, and her books never receiving support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials. Instead, from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her \"factual errors and methodological failings\".\n\nHowever, the publication of the Murray thesis in the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" made it accessible to \"journalists, film-makers popular novelists and thriller writers\", who adopted it \"enthusiastically\". Influencing works of literature, it inspired writings by Aldous Huxley and Robert Graves.\nSubsequently, in 1939, an English occultist named Gerald Gardner claimed to have been initiated into a surviving group of the pagan Witch-Cult known as the New Forest coven, although modern historical investigation has led scholars to believe that this coven was not ancient as Gardner believed, but was instead founded in the 1920s or 1930s by occultists wishing to fashion a revived Witch-Cult based upon Murray's theories. Taking this New Forest coven's beliefs and practices as a basis, Gardner went on to found Gardnerian Wicca, one of the most prominent traditions in the contemporary Pagan religion now known as Wicca, which revolved around the worship of a Horned God and Goddess, the celebration of festivals known as \"Sabbats\", and the practice of ritual magic. He also went on to write several books about the historical Witch-Cult, \"Witchcraft Today\" (1954) and \"The Meaning of Witchcraft\" (1959), and in these books, Gardner used the phrase \"the burning times\" in reference to the European and North American witch trials.\n\nIn the early 20th century, a number of individuals and groups emerged in Europe, primarily Britain, and subsequently the United States as well, claiming to be the surviving remnants of the pagan Witch-Cult described in the works of Margaret Murray. The first of these actually appeared in the last few years of the 19th century, being a manuscript that American folklorist Charles Leland claimed he had been given by a woman who was a member of a group of witches worshipping the god Lucifer and goddess Diana in Tuscany, Italy. He published the work in 1899 as \"Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches\". Whilst historians and folklorists have accepted that there are folkloric elements to the gospel, none have accepted it as being the text of a genuine Tuscan religious group, and believe it to be of late-nineteenth-century composition.\n\nWiccans extended claims regarding the witch-cult in various ways, for instance by utilising the British folklore associating witches with prehistoric sites to assert that the witch-cult used to use such locations for religious rites, in doing so legitimising contemporary Wiccan use of them.\nBy the 1990s, many Wiccans had come to recognise the inaccuracy of the witch-cult theory and had accepted it as a mythological origin story.\n\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, various feminist interpretations of the witch trials have been made and published. One of the earliest individuals to do so was the American Matilda Joslyn Gage, a writer who was deeply involved in the first-wave feminist movement for women's suffrage. In 1893, she published the book \"Woman, Church and State\", which was \"written in a tearing hurry and in time snatched from a political activism which left no space for original research.\" Likely influenced by the works of Jules Michelet about the Witch-Cult, she claimed that the witches persecuted in the Early Modern period were pagan priestesses adhering to an ancient religion venerating a Great Goddess. She also repeated the erroneous statement, taken from the works of several German authors, that nine million people had been killed in the witch hunt. The United States has become the centre of development for these feminist interpretations.\n\nIn 1973, two American second-wave feminists, Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English, published an extended pamphlet in which they put forward the idea that the women persecuted had been the traditional healers and midwives of the community who were being deliberately eliminated by the male medical establishment. This theory disregarded the fact that the majority of those persecuted were neither healers nor midwives and that in various parts of Europe these individuals were commonly among those encouraging the persecutions. In 1994, Anne Llewellyn Barstow published her book \"Witchcraze\", which was later described by Scarre and Callow as \"perhaps the most successful\" attempt to portray the trials as a systematic male attack on women.\n\nOther feminist historians have rejected this interpretation of events; historian Diane Purkiss described it as \"not politically helpful\" because it constantly portrays women as \"helpless victims of patriarchy\" and thus does not aid them in contemporary feminist struggles. She also condemned it for factual inaccuracy by highlighting that radical feminists adhering to it ignore the historicity of their claims, instead promoting it because it is perceived as authorising the continued struggle against patriarchal society. She asserted that many radical feminists nonetheless clung to it because of its \"mythic significance\" and firmly delineated structure between the oppressor and the oppressed.\n\n\n\n"}

In principle they are responsible for looking after any prisoners in the Tower and safeguarding the British crown jewels; they have also conducted guided tours since the Victorian era.\n\nIn 2011, there were 37 Yeomen Warders and one Chief Warder, and this number has remained stable since then.\n\nAll warders are retired from the Armed Forces of Commonwealth realms and must be former warrant officers with at least 22 years of service. They must also hold the Long Service and Good Conduct medal.\n\nThe Yeomen Warders are often incorrectly referred to as Yeomen of the Guard, which is actually a distinct corps of Royal Bodyguards.\n\nAlthough the Yeomen Warders are often referred to as Yeomen of the Guard, which is a distinct corps of Royal Bodyguards of the British monarch, they are in fact a separate entity within this guard. Gilbert and Sullivan's opera, \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" (1888), is set in the 16th century, an earlier era before the two corps were split apart; it concerns what are today the Yeomen Warders.\n\nThe name \"Beefeater\" is of uncertain origin, with various proposed derivations. The term was common as early as the 17th century as a slang term for the English in general. The earliest connection to the Royal Household came as a reference to the Yeomen of the Guard by Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who frequented the Court in 1669. In referring to the Yeomen of the Guard, he stated, \"A very large ration of beef is given to them daily at the court, and they might be called Beef-eaters\". The \"Beefeater\" name was carried over to the Yeomen Warders, due to the two corps' outward similarities and the Yeoman Warders' more public presence. \"Beefeaters\" also commonly produced and consumed broths made of beef, which were described as rich and hearty. These broths were known, at the time, as \"bef\" or \"beffy\".\n\nWhile this is the most-cited origin, including by the Corps themselves, some etymologists have noted the term's similarity to \"\", the Old English term for a menial servant, lit. \"loaf-eater\", the counterpart of hlaford \"loaf-warden\" and hlæfdige, which became \"lord\" and \"lady\" respectively. Conjectures that the name derives from \"buffetier\" (an Old French term meaning 'a waiter or servant') are not considered probable.\n\nThe Yeomen Warders were formed in 1485 by the new King Henry VII, the first monarch of the Tudor dynasty; the Tudor rose, a heraldic badge of the dynasty, is part of the badge of the Yeomen Warders to this day.\n\nIn 1509 Henry VIII moved his official residence from the Tower of London. The Tower retained the formal status of a royal palace and to mark this a party of twelve Yeomen of the Guard was left in place as a token garrison. The title of this detachment was subsequently changed to that of Tower warders as a more accurate reflection of their actual duties. As warders without any ceremonial state functions they forfeited the right to wear the scarlet royal livery of the now separate Yeoman of the Guard. This was, however, restored to them during the reign of Edward VI (1547–1553), reportedly at the request of a high court official who had been briefly imprisoned in the Tower and was impressed by the behavior of the warders.\n\nThe original Tudor guard was split into two categories: the ordinary (i.e., permanent) guard and the additional troops of the extraordinary. In 1550, for example, the ordinary mustered 105 men, with an additional 300 extraordinary yeomen. Until 1549, the guards at the Tower were numbered among the extraordinary but in that year were raised to the status of ordinary yeomen. There was a considerable wage difference between the two groups. In 1562, a yeoman of the ordinary received 16d per day, whereas an extraordinary yeoman was paid the same as a common infantryman (4d or 6d). In 1551, the ordinary was expanded to 200 men, of whom 100 were to be archers and 100 halberdiers, but these numbers were not maintained. Uniform at this time was a velvet coat trimmed with silver gilt, worn over armour.\n\nThe Yeomen Warders provided the permanent garrison of the Tower, but the Constable of the Tower could call upon the men of the Tower Hamlets to supplement them when necessary. The Tower Hamlets, aka Tower Division was an area, significantly larger than the modern London Borough of the same name, which owed military service to the Constable in his \"ex officio\" role as Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets.\n\nIn 2018, there were 37 Yeomen Warders and one Chief Warder. At one time, they were primarily guards but more recently, their role is primarily ceremonial; they have become greeters and guides for visitors, as part of their 21 duties. \n\nAll Yeoman Warders are retired members of the armed services; to be appointed, one must be \"a former Warrant Officer, class 1 or 2, (or the equivalent rank in other services) and in exceptional circumstances, a Staff Sergeant\" from the Royal Navy, British Army, Royal Air Force, or Royal Marines; must have earned the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal; and must have served for 22 years in the regular armed services. Until 2009, sailors were ineligible to become Yeomen Warders. This was because sailors of the Royal Navy—unlike soldiers, marines, and airmen—swear an oath of allegiance to the Admiralty rather than the monarch personally. In 2009, sailors became eligible to join the Yeoman Warders after the Queen consented to a petition from the Governor of the Tower to allow Royal Navy senior ratings to serve.\n\nThe Yeomen Warders normally wear an 'undress' uniform of dark blue with red trimmings. When the sovereign visits the Tower, or the warders are on duty at a state occasion, they wear red and gold uniforms similar to those of the Yeomen of the Guard. These uniforms are referred to by the Yeoman Warders as the \"Tudor State Dress\".\n\nThe Yeomen Warders and their families live in tied accommodation inside the fortress, paying council taxes and rent. Most also have a home outside the grounds in order to have a break from their work environment. The Yeoman Warders Club is a pub exclusively for the Warders and for their invited guests. They must own a home outside the fortress to occupy when they retire. Some of the accommodation dates back to the 13th century. The community of the Tower of London is made up of these Yeoman Warders and their families, the Resident Governor and officers, a chaplain and a doctor.\n\nYeomen Warders participate in the Ceremony of the Keys each night.\n\nOn 1 July 2007 a service woman, Moira Cameron, became the first female Yeoman Warder in the history of the institution. Cameron joined the Army in 1985 at age 20. Aged 42 and Warrant Officer Class 2, she became eligible not long before her appointment. Previously, she served as Superintendent Clerk at a Brigade Headquarters with the Adjutant General's Corps.\n\nIn 2009, three male warders were suspended, accused of bullying of Cameron; two were dismissed and one was subsequently re-instated following the month-long investigation with the allegations against him \"unproven\".\n\nThe Yeoman Warder Ravenmaster (also known as the Ravenmaster for short) is one of the Yeomen Warders who has the responsibility to maintain the welfare of the ravens of the Tower of London. The official title has been in use since the 1960s.\n\nIt is not known how long the ravens have been living in the Tower of London, but they were resident by the time of King Charles II. Legend maintains that should the ravens ever leave the Tower, the White Tower will fall and disaster will befall the kingdom. When John Flamsteed, the \"astronomical observator\", complained that the ravens interfered with observatory work, Charles initially ordered them destroyed, but reminded of the legend, the story goes that he decided to instead relocate the Royal Observatory to Greenwich. He decreed that at least six ravens must always remain at the Tower. The presence of captive ravens probably goes back only to the later 19th century. \n\nThe current (2018) Yeoman Warder Ravenmaster of the Tower of London is retired Staff Sergeant Chris Skaife (a former Drum Major with the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment), who took over from Derrick Coyle in 2011 , who currently cares for seven of the birds. Skaife has written a memoir of his experiences in the role, \"The Ravenmaster: My Life with the Ravens at the Tower of London\".\n\nIn order to prevent the ravens from flying away, their flight feathers have traditionally been trimmed so that they could not fly in a straight line for any appreciable distance. The ravens have been free, however, to roam the Tower grounds. More recently, the Ravenmaster has been clipping less of the wings and feathers, in order to allow them to fly, instead of merely hopping or gliding, and they can reach the top of the buildings. One of the birds, Merlina, is allowed to fly to the wharf on the Thames but that she always returns due to the bonding with her keeper. During Skaife's tenure to date, only one raven, Munin, escaped but was captured by a member of the public. \n\nThe Ravenmaster releases the birds from their cages and prepares breakfast for them at dawn each day. The warders have commented that the \"real beefeaters\" at the Tower are the ravens. Traditionally, they were fed raw beef bought at Smithfield Meat Market by the Ravenmaster. Recently, other foods have been introduced to their diet, such as chicks, lamb, mice and pig hearts, as well as peanuts, dog biscuits soaked in blood and fish in hope that this tactic would reduce the amount of scavenging from the garbage bins. \nThe earliest known reference to a captive Tower raven is a picture from 1883.\n\n"}
