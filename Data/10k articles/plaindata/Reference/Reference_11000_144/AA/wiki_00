Located in Istanbul, Turkey, the museum was established by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and opened on November 12, 2011.\n\nThe museum is housed in the two-storey Procession Kiosk (), a 19th-century historic building on the outer walls of Gülhane Park that belongs to Topkapı Palace. It was used by the Ottoman sultans to accept salute of janissary soldiers parading as well as a pleasure locale. The building is situated across the Sublime Porte. It was used from the 1910s on as the center of the Fine Arts Association. From 1928 to the end 1930s, it served as a meeting place of an association dedicated to Turkish language and literature.\n\nOn the ground floor, there are two rooms and an entrance hall. The first floor houses the former throne room, in addition to two halls and three rooms. The ground floor is designed as a cafeteria, called the \"Writers' Café\", where prize-winning literary works are exhibited. Special corners on the upper floor are dedicated to the life and works of around 50 renowned authors native to Istanbul, with busts of some, including Nedîm (1681–1730), Yahya Kemal Beyatlı (1884–1958), Nâzım Hikmet Ran (1902–1963), Necip Fazıl Kısakürek (1904–1983), Aziz Nesin (1915–1995), Orhan Pamuk (born 1952), Ayşe Kulin (born 1941), Zülfü Livaneli (born 1946) and Doğan Hızlan (born 1937) in addition to Tanpınar. It is also a place for discussions on various authors, poetry performances, literature award ceremonies, and writing workshops. The library of the museum accommodates over 8,000 books, including about 1,000 books on Istanbul as well as volumes of more than 100 periodicals on literature and other fields of the arts. The museum hosts also temporary art exhibitions. It is the fourth of its kind in Turkey after the literature museums in Ankara, Adana and Diyarbakır.\n\nThe museum library is accessible by the public transport line Tram T1 (Kabataş–Bağcılar), and is open on weekdays between 10:00 and 19:00 local time.\n\n"}

His character of \"mirror of princes\" and \"mirror of citizens\" has been pointed out by all scholars.\n\nHe explains things that happened really and that he saw and lived. Muntaner often uses \"I was there\", which underlines its role as witness, and the data it provides helps to know the time of James I. The Catalan writer and investigator, Ferran Soldevila has been one of the main interpreters of the work of this medieval chronicler and his praise is quite eloquent.\n\nRamon Muntaner was born in Peralada in 1265. He was the son of a remarkable family that hosted Jaume I the Conqueror (in 1274, Jaume I went to the Council of Lyon and sojourned in the Castle of Peralada with Alfonso X the Wise of Castile.This fact, which occurred when he was nine years old, was one of his most precious memories and he mentions this event with emotion in the \"Chronicle\". In the same way that in the European novelist tradition (for example, Chrétien de Troyes ), it is exposed to us, how the vision of a great hero in the eyes of a child is capable of changing the course of his life. Muntaner says that the vision of James I when he was a child led him to devote himself as a writer explaining everything he had seen..\nIn 1285, Peralada was destroyed by the Almogavars during the Crusade against the Crown of Aragon and had to emigrate. When he was twenty, Ramon Muntaner took part in the conquest of Menorca ; Later, he participated in the fight against the French during the War of Sicily, in 1300 at the Siege of Messina, next to Roger de Flor and as the administrator of his company. In the summer of 1302, he began under the orders of this leader, the expedition to the East. In 1307, he left the company, and in 1311 he got married..\n\nIn 1315, he had to travel between Sicily and Roussillon, as he was in charge of a delicate mission: to transport from Catania to Perpignan an orphan baby, the future Jaume III of Mallorca, in order to deliver him to his grandparents. From that moment on, his memoirs were removed and matured for ten years, until he had a revealing \"dream\" that prompted him, in 1325, at the age of sixty, in Valencia, to start writing the \"Chronicle\", which he finished three years later. Muntaner died in Ibiza in 1336\n\nMuntaner had a personal relationship with all the kings of the House of Aragon, the House of Mallorca and the House of Sicily belonging to the lineage of the Casal de Barcelona that were contemporary to him. In doing his work, he mainly resorted to historiographic texts for the reigns of James I and Peter the Great, and, from Alfons el Franc, his almost exclusive source is his own experience.\n\nThe work was written to be read aloud. Whenever he addresses his \"listeners\", he usually calls them \"lords\". Muntaner managed to establish direct communication with his \"listeners\". For this, he uses joglaresque procedures (such as the question \"What will I say?\"), As well as using a live and colloquial language\n\nThe fundamental objective of the work is to glorify the kings of the House of Aragon. The monarchism of our chronicler is closely related to providentialism and nationalism. The blood, a common destiny and the language (the \"beautiful catalanesc of the world\" ) are the elements that make up the base of the Catalan and Aragonese community. It is impossible to find in the whole of medieval Europe anything that resembles the \"national\" maturity of the \"Chronicle\" \n\nHis life and adherence to the dynasty and the Catalan language, to which he expressed an extraordinary devotion, represent the counterweight to the centripetal forces within the Catalan national community resulting from the organization of conquered lands in new kingdoms (Mallorca, Valencia, Sicily) and, sometimes, the implantation of a new dynastic branch (Mallorca, Sicily). The awareness of the danger of division and the value of the union also explained it in its chronicle, especially in the example of the rush plant, \"mata de jonc\" in Catalan (Similar to the Sertorius horse tail example).\n\nWith this work, Ramón Muntaner also became the first author in the Catalan language to capture the aspirations of a large part of the Catalan elite for an Iberian political reunification, as he commented on Ariza's interview between the monarchs of the Crown of Aragon and the Crown of Castile, in which the latter proposed to Peter the Great an alliance between them, the king of Portugal and the king of Mallorca, Muntaner added: \".\".. And, assuredly, he spoke the truth; if these four Kings of Spain whom he named, who are of one flesh and blood, held together, little need they fear all the other powers of the world.\"..\" \"(.\"..si aquests quatre reys que ell nomenava d'Espanya, qui són una carn e una sang, se teguessen ensemps, poch duptare tot laltre poder del món.\"\").\n\nRegarding the Catalan Company of the East, Ramon Muntaner began to write his chronicle in 1325, that is, 17 years after the Byzantine Greek George Pachymeres wrote his work \"De Michaele et Andronico Palæologis\". While the work of Pachymeres offers the Greek vision of the facts, emphasizing the atrocities committed by the Company and Roger de Flor until 1308, the Chronicle of Ramon Muntaner is the only western source that relates the events experienced by the Catalan Company of The Orient. In some aspects, the work of Ramon Muntaner becomes, not only a glorification of Roger de Flor and the Company, but also a counter-narrative of the work of Pachymeres, relating some facts that the Greek does not mention, and eluding to explain facts that the Greek author does report in detail. Some of these facts would be:\n\nMuntaner's work had great repercussions and diffusion during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and was used, for example, in various passages of \"Tirant lo Blanc\" by Joanot Martorell. It was edited for the first time in the sixteenth century, coinciding with a time of great revision of historiography; This first edition was commissioned and paid by the jurors of the city of Valencia. New printed editions took place during the 19th century, during the period of romantic exaltation of the European medieval past, even a translation into English made by the Hakluyt Society in 1920-21\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relations of the Crown of Aragon with other kingdoms and territories gave place, already since the Middle age, to the creation of big quantity of exonyms that nowadays they are almost forgotten. Here follow some of the exonyms that appear in the Chroncle of Muntaner:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10854389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10854389", "title": "Crusade of Romanianism", "text": "Crusade of Romanianism\n\nThe Crusade of Romanianism (, also known as \"Vulturii Albi\", \"White Eagles\", or \"Steliștii\", \"Stelists\") was an eclectic far-right movement in Romania, founded in 1934 by Mihai Stelescu. It originated as a dissident faction of the Iron Guard, Romania's main fascist movement, and was virulently critical of Guard leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. Stelescu reinterpreted nationalist ideology through the lens of anticapitalism and \"humane\" antisemitism, appropriating some ideas from communism and Italian fascism. The Crusade was famously associated with Panait Istrati, world-renowned novelist and dissident communist, who added into the mix of \"Romanianism\" some elements of libertarian socialism.\n\nThe Stelists oscillated between maverick independence and electoral alliances with more prestigious nationalist parties. The Crusade was a minor party, whose decision of publicly settling scores with the Iron Guard proved fatal. In the summer of 1936, Stelescu was murdered by an Iron Guard death squad, and his party only survived for one more year. Its caretakers during that final period were journalist Alexandru Talex and General Nicolae Rădescu.\n\nOriginally named \"The White Eagles\", the Crusade emerged in early 1935, as a splinter group from the Iron Guard. Stelescu's break with Codreanu was sudden and public. In 1932, Stelescu was a prominent Guard politico, tasked with political campaigning in Bucharest and the youngest Romanian Parliament member. As documented by visitors Jean and Jérôme Tharaud, Stelescu eclipsed his political boss in matters of oratory and political competence. As a consequence of this, Codreanu began handing him risky assignments, implicating him in the assassination of Premier Ion G. Duca (for which Stelescu served a term in prison). It is also likely that Stelescu was infuriated by Codreanu's refusal to tackle the political establishment head on: in 1934, the Guard was keeping a low profile, content with mildly criticizing the authoritarian King of Romania, Carol II.\n\nWhen, in September 1934, Stelescu went public with his first denunciations of Codrenist tactics, he was promptly excluded from the Guard. The decision had a vague disclaimer: Stelescu could be welcomed back into the Guard on condition that he perform an exceptional act of self-sacrifice. According to later Codrenist mythology, Stelescu had in fact been exposed as the would-be assassin of Codreanu. For his part, Stelescu alleged that, by hinting at reconciliation, Codreanu had discreetly urged him to poison another one of the Iron Guard's adversaries: Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu.\n\nStelescu left together with some other high-ranking activists of Codreanu's movement, who helped him establish the \"White Eagles\" party, and possibly convinced all of the Guard's youth sections in Bucharest to join them. Historian Franklin L. Ford sees the schism as important, arguing that Stelescu effectively took control of the \"Cross Brotherhood\" network, which he had helped recruit for the Guard in the late 1920s. Citing the Guard's supposed elitism, Stelescu hoped to rely on support from more populist Guardsmen, including Ion Moța and Gheorghe Clime. Reportedly, the splinter group soon found support among figures of the Carol regime, who financed it as a way of drawing away support from the Guard.\n\nOn November 22, 1934, Stelescu established his eponymous weekly newspaper, \"Cruciada Românismului\", with Alexandru Talex as editor and himself as director. Talex, who was politically independent, had been university colleagues with Stelescu. He was moved by Stelescu's marginalization, but, as he recalled in a later interview, personally disliked him. Talex and Stelescu were allegedly supplied with funds by Prince Constantin Karadja, who also contributed to the paper. Another important figure was Gheorghe Beza, an Aromanian dissident of the Iron Guard, famous for his earlier involvement in political conspiracies. Other men involved with Stelescu's newspaper, and probably his movement, were journalists Sergiu Lecca, Dem. Bassarabeanu and Mircea Mateescu. Joining them were a cartoonist, Gall, and, occasionally, the aspiring poet Constantin Virgil Gheorghiu.\n\nMore famously, \"Cruciada Românismului\" hosted articles by Panait Istrati. He was a literary celebrity and long-time socialist, whose public denunciation of the Soviet Union had sparked an international controversy. It is still unclear whether Istrati was ever formally affiliated with the Crusade as a political party. Some authors suggest as much. In April Istrati died from tuberculosis in Bucharest. He had been unable to support himself during his last months, and relied on government handouts—an appeasement that was much ridiculed from the far left. An independent Trotskyist newspaper, \"Proletarul\", claimed that the Stelists had supervised Istrati's funeral ceremony, driving away his leftist friends.\n\nThe Stelists were intensely courted by other far-right organizations, with which the Guard was competing for the nationalist vote. The Crusade was especially close to the National-Christian Defense League (LANC), from which the Guard had split almost a decade before, and envisaged the creation of a \"united front\" against democracy and \"the radical left\". In March 1935, a Crusade delegation attended a LANC's national congress. The state monitored such agreements, which also involved the Romanian Front, and reported that the Crusade was in the process of merging with the LANC.\n\nThe LANC merger never took place. In September 1935, the Crusade of Romanianism sealed a pact with the right-wing \"Georgist\" Liberals and Grigore Forțu's extremist Citizens' Bloc of National Salvation. This three-pronged alliance aimed at involvement in national politics. The \"Georgists\" had also formed a cartel with the People's Party (PP), which had previously been one of the three most powerful parties in Romania. The \"Georgist\"-Populist alliance, or \"Constitutional Front\", came to include both the Stelists and the Citizen's Bloc.\n\nPP leader Alexandru Averescu was working to gather as much support as needed for prompting Carol to hand him power. His plan backfired: on one hand, the Stelists did not necessarily endorse the idea of a new Averescu government; on the other, the PP moderates protested against Averescu's cohabitation with fascist groups. By early 1936, the Constitutional Front still existed, but the PP had effectively withdrawn from it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Crusade was preparing to settle scores with the Iron Guard. Its newspapers published detailed reports about the contacts between Codreanu and King Carol, noting that the Guard enjoyed free publicity \"in the official and semiofficial press\", and even that government money was being spent on manufacturing Guardist insignia. More disturbingly for Codreanu, Stelescu was publishing information regarding secret contacts between the Guard and the royal mistress, Elena Lupescu, as well as statements implicating Codreanu in the Duca assassination and questioning his Romanian ethnicity. Both Stelescu and Beza visited with Armand Călinescu, the Minister of Internal Affairs, providing him with a full record of the Guard's policy on assassinations.\n\nStelescu himself already expected to be assassinated by the Codrenists, and repeatedly taunted his adversaries, instructing them to shoot him, but \"not in the back\". In July 1936, while recovering at the Brâncovenesc Hospital, where he had undergone an appendectomy, Stelescu fell victim to the Guard's revenge. A \"Decemviri\" death squad, comprising ten Theology students, had formally received Codreanu's blessing at the Iron Guard Congress in Târgu Mureș that April. Seizing its opportunity, it stormed into the hospital building and shot Stelescu to death. This murder left an enduring mark on public memory because of its ritualistic nature: Stelescu's body was not just riddled with bullets, but also bludgeoned or hacked to pieces.\n\nThe orphaned movement still counted among its members some relevant figures in Romanian politics. Nicolae Rădescu, a Romanian Land Forces general, was an affiliate, and, according to some sources, became the Crusade's leader upon Stelescu's murder. He was in any case the decision-maker, and probably contributed to the movement's financing. Previously registered with Averescu's PP, Rădescu was a stated enemy of the political establishment. In 1933, upon presenting his resignation from the army, he had accused \"profiteering politicians\" and the king's \"camarilla\" of commercializing military life.\n\nOther Crusade members were harmed by Codrenist attacks, and, within the Iron Guard, \"Stelism\" became a crime punishable by death. Nevertheless, Codreanu feared retaliation, and surrounded himself with body guards. \"Cruciada Românismului\" newspaper was in print until 1937, by which time some of its members had embraced other causes. Moving on from the Crusade, Sergiu Lecca was involved in arranging contacts between the mainstream National Peasants' Party (PNȚ) and communist cells. Beza was also accepted into the PNȚ, founding the anti-fascist Peasant Guards as its paramilitary section. At least one other Stelist had registered with the Social Democratic Party by 1946. Instead, Mircea Mateescu returned into the Iron Guard, celebrating its fight against \"the deep, massive, darkness of the Romanian Sodom\".\n\nIn March 1937, the Gheorghe Tătărescu government clamped down on all paramilitary movements, banning political uniforms, including the Guard's green shirts and the Crusade's carmine shirts. The group dissolved itself, but Rădescu remained politically active into World War II, and was listed as one of King Carol's more potent enemies. He survived the \"National Legionary\" episode of Iron Guard rule, when he was reportedly marginalized as a \"Freemason\". According to one testimony, the general was never forgiven by the Guard for having supported Stelescu. During the putsch of January 1941, Iron Guard assassin squads were on the lookout for Rădescu, who went into hiding.\n\nSome former Crusade members were already working at undermining Romania's involvement with the Axis Powers. From 1940, Beza took to the underground, redesigning the Peasant Guards as a \"Free Romanian Movement\"; tried for sedition, he was forced into exile. When, under the Ion Antonescu regime, Romanian troops occupied Transnistria, Rădescu issued a formal protest and spent a full year in the concentration camp. From his diplomatic post, Prince Karadja extended protection to Jews fleeing the Holocaust, coming into conflict with the SS. Meanwhile, Sergiu Lecca, who was the brother of Antonescu aide Radu Lecca, took part in informal negotiations between Romania and the Allied Powers.\n\nAlthough still an anticommunist, Rădescu was brought to high office by the Soviet occupation of Romania, and, from December 1944, served as Prime Minister. He refused to sanction Soviet abuse of power and clashed with the Romanian Communist Party, while pursuing war against Nazi Germany. Additionally, Rădescu was also at war with the Iron Guard puppet government that was set up behind enemy lines, but it is still debated whether or not he actually protected those Guardsmen who did not defect to the Germans.\n\nThe toppling of Rădescu's cabinet in February 1945 was a new step toward the communization of Romania. Indicted as a crypto-fascist by the communist authorities, he escaped to New York City, where he helped form the Romanian National Committee. The surviving membership of the Crusade of Romanianism was also hunted down. According to aviator Ion Coșoveanu, who was for long a political prisoner of the Romanian communist republic, Stelists were a distinct faction among the anticommunist underground. Coșoveanu (quoted by writer Niculae Gheran) recalled that, once in prison, Crusade members used to bicker with Iron Guard rivals. Coșoveanu also notes that the Stelist faction accepted into its ranks the poet Radu Gyr, until discovering that he was informing on them for the Guardists.\n\nTalex himself was not touched by communist persecutions and was perceived by the authorities as a fellow traveler. When Istrati was posthumously rehabilitated in the 1970s, Talex worked on publishing his manuscripts and his correspondence. As argued by cultural historian Zigu Ornea, Talex's work in this field makes a point of obfuscating Istrati's contribution to the Crusade, as well as Talex's own. This contrasted with the treatment of other former Crusade people: Dem. Bassarabeanu's poetry was stricken from public memory by communist censorship, due to the author's fascist beliefs. Another poet, Mihu Dragomir, albeit formally aligned with communist ideology, was investigated for a supposed teenage involvement with the Crusade.\n\nPolitical historian Stanley G. Payne describes the Crusade as distinct among the Romanian fascist groups: \"a tiny organization which sought to target workers and to inspire socioeconomic transformation.\" Within the party, there was always a degree of assimilation between fascist trappings and far-left causes, indicative of Stelescu's indecision. In his first-ever editorial column, Stelescu derided all political uniforms, and implicitly all political extremes, stating: \"one can believe in something without donning a colored shirt, just as one can wear a colored shirt without believing in anything.\" He demanded a \"united front\" of \"fearless warriors\", entirely cut off from all preexisting ideologies. Nevertheless, Stelescu had personally selected green-colored shirts as the Iron Guard uniform, before his own movement settled on carmine.\n\nIn March 1935 Eugène Ionesco, the left-leaning literary columnist, noted that Stelescu's newspaper made a habit of \"confusing the extremes\". Ionesco was referring to \"Cruciada Românismului\"s appreciation for the socialist poetry of Liviu Bratoloveanu. The appropriation of leftist ideas was especially apparent after the Crusade's involvement in the international Istrati scandal. When he first publicized his pact with Stelescu, Istrati specified an \"absolute requirement that the Crusade keep itself equally distant from fascism, communism and the antisemitism of hooligans.\" In one of his letters, where he paraphrases the Stelist program, Istrati reaffirms this principle, while also noting: \"Ours is a national movement for economic change, for civic education and for social combat. We are against capitalism, oppression and violence.\"\n\nThe group was entirely against the parliamentary system, but harbored two distinct currents when it came to supplanting it. Stelescu himself wrote that \"democracy sickens us\", since it had resulted in inept governance \"by a mass of nitwits\". The movement viewed liberalism and human rights with suspicion rather than hostility, since they left the door open for \"capitalism and politicking\". Istrati had dissenting views. In its Christmas 1934 issue, \"Cruciada Românismului\" published his \"Letter to... the Right\", which called democracy \"putrid\" but described dictatorship as an unsound regime: \"Dictatorship, of whatever kind, signals that the social organism has grown old. It is the system that will suppress in its adversary all his fighting means, to take them over for its own use, like an old man who ties up a robust youth and then proceeds to beat him up at his own convenience.\"\n\nBeyond its anticapitalism, the Crusade had as its main characteristic a strong connection with Italian fascism, as opposed to Nazism. Historian Francisco Veiga describes this as being a necessary repositioning against \"Codreanu's Germanophilia\"—when Nazi Germany and Italy where still competing with each other in Southeastern Europe. Other historians also stress the Crusade's anti-Nazism. F. L. Ford also writes that Stelescu's \"dramatic forecasts\" are notable protests against the Guard's Nazification. Armin Heinen paraphrases Stelescu's message: \"he feared [Germany] would impose upon Romania the status of a colony.\" Also according to Heinen, Codreanu's celebration of Nazism as an international phenomenon had turned Stelescu's attention toward the Benito Mussolini alternative.\n\nAs Talex recalls, Istrati was bothered by Stelescu's homages to Mussolini, and, on one occasion, threatened to withdraw from the common enterprise. His own political preferences were veering toward libertarian socialism and anarchism. Inspired by Gandhism, the \"Letter to... the Right\" advised against all forms of political violence. Istrati saw the Crusade as \"rather a spiritual movement\". According to Ornea, this was a naive assessment, and evidenced the degree to which Istrati was being \"manipulated\" by Talex.\n\nFor Istrati's adversaries on the left, the Crusade involvement was proof that Istrati was a covert fascist. The allegations were publicized by two of Istrati's former colleagues in international communism, Henri Barbusse and Francis Jourdain. According to such sources, Istrati's \"mercenary literature\" and his contributions to a \"fascist newspaper\" earned him some 50,000₣, paid for by big oil. Overall, Trotskyist commentators were more lenient, writing off Istrati's inconsistencies as a sign of his perennial nervous instability.\n\nIstrati made a point of responding in Stelescu's paper, under the headline \"The Objectivity of the 'Independent' Communist Press\" (March 21, 1935). He was publicly defended by his friend, the anti-Soviet leftist Victor Serge, who described Istrati's last combat in verse: \nHowever, Istrati's connection with the Crusade was not his only contact with right-wing radicalism: he had also promised to have his political testament printed in \"Gringoire\", a newspaper of the French far-right. Against Talex's disclaimers, several later exegetes have reanimated the debate about Istrati's possible fascist leanings. Historian Jean-Michel Palmier includes Istrati's name on a list of \"intellectuals [who] saw for a moment in fascism the possibility of arousing a crisis-struck Europe from its lethargy.\" He is in the company of Knut Hamsun, Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis. Philologist Tudorel Urian asks: \"Who really is Istrati: the frantic socialist he was before his visit to the USSR [...] or the nationalist of his very last months, the emblem of a Guardist periodical? There is something that those who judge him rarely take into account: in the periods when he flirted with socialism [...] and Guardism, both movements where in their romantic, idealistic stages. Once he came face to face with the brutal realities of the Soviet regime, Istrati broke with socialism and perhaps his famous motto, \"je ne marche pas\" ['no, I won't bite'] would have come into play in relation with the Guardists, should he have lived to see their earliest crimes.\"\n\nAccording to literary historian Angelo Mitchievici, \"Interestingly, [the Crusade] had stated its dissidence and a distinct position within the Iron Guard movement. Perhaps it was the group's marginal, dissident status that appealed to Istrati. [...] Even if, in this very context, Panait Istrati endures as a freelancer, he could not have evaded the abusive assimilation into a direction that did not truly reflect his affinities.\"\n\nThe Istrati scandal touches another controversial aspect of Stelist policies: their Iron Guard-inherited antisemitism. Stelescu sent the message in November 1934, when he criticized ethnic minorities for monopolizing the job market: \"Factory positions for Romanian workers, our own kind first and if anything is left we would gladly share it with the foreigner, if he is indeed in need of.\" According to Veiga, Istrati \"toned down the antisemitism of Stelescu and his followers, but the [Stelist] Movement continued to be a far-right one.\" Also, \"the disillusionment he felt toward Soviet communism did not manage to make Istrati into a fascist; quite the contrary, he was the one to influence Stelescu, making him renounce, for instance, his antisemitism.\" Among the Crusade men, Prince Karadja witnessed first-hand the application of antisemitic terror in 1930s Germany, and was already taking measures to protect the Jewish Romanian expatriates.\n\nIn his papers of 1935, Istrati presents himself exclusively as an enemy of \"the Jewish bourgeoisie\", a class he describes as \"corrupt, pseudo-humanitarian, pseudo-democratic\" and accuses of stirring up scandal. Istrati's articles in \"Cruciada Românismului\" are more adamantly philosemitic. One of them, \"A Letter to Love\", led to a series of articles on the subject, from Stelescu and other Crusade people. In his own articles, Talex answered for the Stelist movement: \"Panait Istrati, do you know what it is we need? A fist... The Crusade of Romanianism will attempt to become that fist... Our antisemitism? Just the same as yours: a humane one. But it is also combative, for as long as the Judaic element shall attempt to set up a state within our own state, sabotaging us with any opportunity it gets\". Stelescu's newspaper was noted for its obstinate claim that Jews were a rootless, disloyal race.\nThe Crusade's agenda was debated among Jewish Romanian intellectuals. Fellow writer Mihail Sebastian described Istrati as politically \"illiterate\" and \"addled\". In his words, \"Mr. Istrati fights nowadays for the Crusade of Romanianism, searching for the formula of reasonable antisemitism (neither here nor there), for the way into a more gentle chauvinism, for a nice agreement between his anarchic vocation and a methodical process of bashing heads in.\" Other Jewish literary figures, including Josué Jéhouda, issued statements in support of Istrati's stance.\n\nThe Crusade may have contextualized its antisemitic reflexes within a pro-Christian bias. The American Jewish Committee papers describe the Crusade as \"a Fascist group which did not have anti-Jewish tendencies\", quoting Stelescu's statement \"that he was not a Jew-baiter and that, although his party was nationalist, it was inspired by genuine Christian principles.\" The movement resented the secularization of public affairs, and expressed admiration for Romanian Orthodoxy: \"And if some church servants have indeed trespassed, faith itself is not to blame. The belief in God and The Cross is a banner and support for our combat, and the token of our coming victory.\" However, according to at least one account, the ailing Istrati was in the process of becoming a militant Roman Catholic.\n\nThe Crusade believed that its mission included protecting Christian interests against the consequences of modernity. It was critical of feminism, noting that Christianity itself had liberated women, had given them status and purpose. However, it also asserted that woman was \"the guardian angel, always in the shadow of man.\" Feminism, meanwhile, was \"equality in vice.\" The Stelists also accused the Soviet Union and its Romanian sympathizers (for instance the staff of \"Cuvântul Liber\" newspaper) of mounting an international campaign against Christianity.\n\nWhen Stelescu founded his \"White Eagles\", the right-wing nativists, the centrists and the advocates of left-wing nationalism in Romania had been disputing over the concept of \"Romanianism\" for over a decade. The idea of a homegrown ideological current of that name was swiftly embraced by intellectual sympathizers of the Iron Guard, among them Nae Ionescu, Nichifor Crainic, Alexandru Randa, Traian Brăileanu and Mihail Manoilescu. An alternative Romanianism, liberal and skeptical toward nationalist rhetoric, was being promoted by the philosophers Constantin Rădulescu-Motru and Mircea Eliade, who demanded the continuous Westernization of Romanian society. Before he was won over by fascism, Eliade defined Romanianism as \"neither fascism nor chauvinism—rather, the mere desire to realize an organic, unitary, ethnic, balanced state\".\n\nThe Crusade's version of the concept borrowed from all sides of the debate. In his \"democracy sickens us\" essay, Stelescu proposed: \"Romanianism is the only credo that might invigorate this nation. Solutions for its sons, from its bosom, within its spirit, on its soil\". According to Talex, this brand of Romanianism was \"noble and creative\", Istrati being its leading exponent. When first introduced to Gandhism and the Ramakrishna Mission in 1930, Istrati himself had declared: \"To me, the Occident is dead.\" In 1934, Stelescu's newspaper noted with satisfaction that nationalism was even making its comeback in the Soviet Union. Reading the Soviet press, the Stelists remarked that references to the Comintern and the cause of proletarian internationalism were being discarded, and that Mother Russia was returning in force.\n\nTalex, who described himself as a \"know-nothing\" in political matters, had for a personal idol the nationalist historian Vasile Pârvan. He was especially inspired by Pârvan's Russophobia, which colored his reading of Istrati's work. His admiration for \"Romanianism\" pitted him against the more cosmopolitan liberals of the day, prompting the Crusade's journalistic attacks against Eugen Lovinescu, the doyen of Romanian liberalism. Lovinescu (who had been Talex's high school teacher) was called \"a con artist\" in \"Cruciada Românismului\".\n\n"}

Edward's literary tastes emerged early, in a series of essays written at the age of twelve. His home education continued at Queen's College, Cork and at Trinity College, Dublin; at the latter he had a distinguished career, becoming president of the Philosophical Society, and winning the vice-chancellor's prize for English verse and prose, and the first senior moderatorship in ethics and logic. In 1867 he was elected professor of oratory and English literature in Dublin University.\n\nDowden's first book, \"Shakespeare, his Mind and Art\" (1875), resulted from a revision of a course of lectures, and made him widely known as a critic: translations appeared in German and Russian; his \"Poems\" (1876) went into a second edition. His \"Shakespeare Primer\" (1877) was translated into Italian and German. In 1878 the Royal Irish Academy awarded him the Cunningham gold medal \"for his literary writings, especially in the field of Shakespearian criticism.\"\n\nLater works by him in this field included an edition of \"The Sonnets of William Shakespeare\" (1881), \"Passionate Pilgrim\" (1883), \"Introduction to Shakespeare\" (1893), \"Hamlet\" (1899), \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1900), \"Cymbeline\" (1903), and an article entitled \"Shakespeare as a Man of Science\" (in the \"National Review\", July 1902), which criticized T.E. Webb's \"Mystery of William Shakespeare\". His critical essays \"Studies in Literature\" (1878), \"Transcripts and Studies\" (1888), \"New Studies in Literature\" (1895) showed a profound knowledge of the currents and tendencies of thought in various ages and countries; but his \"Life of Shelley\" (1886) made him best known to the public at large. In 1900 he edited an edition of Shelley's works.\nOther books by him which indicate his interests in literature include: Robert Southey (in the \"English Men of Letters\" series, 1880), his edition of \"Southey's Correspondence with Caroline Bowles\" (1881), and \"Select Poems of Southey\" (1895), his Correspondence of Sir Henry Taylor (1888), his edition of Wordsworth's \"Poetical Works\" (1892) and of his \"Lyrical Ballads\" (1890), his \"French Revolution and English Literature\" (1897; lectures given at Princeton University in 1896), \"History of French Literature\" (1897), \"Puritan and Anglican\" (1900), \"Robert Browning\" (1904) and \"Michel de Montaigne\" (1905). His devotion to Goethe led to his succeeding Max Müller in 1888 as president of the English Goethe Society.\n\nIn 1889 he gave the first annual Taylorian Lecture at the University of Oxford, and from 1892 to 1896 served as Clark lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge. To his research are due, among other matters of literary interest, the first account of Thomas Carlyle's \"Lectures on periods of European culture\"; the identification of Shelley as the author of a review (in \"The Critical Review\" of December 1814) of a romance by Thomas Jefferson Hogg; a description of Shelley's \"Philosophical View of Reform\"; a manuscript diary of Fabre d'Églantine; and a record by Dr Wilhelm Weissenborn of Goethe's last days and death. He also discovered a \"Narrative of a Prisoner of War under Napoleon\" (published in \"Blackwood's Magazine\"), an unknown pamphlet by Bishop Berkeley, some unpublished writings of William Hayley relating to Cowper, and a unique copy of the \"Tales of Terror\".\n\nHis wide interests and scholarly methods made his influence on criticism both sound and stimulating, and his own ideals are well described in his essay on \"The Interpretation of Literature\" in his \"Transcripts and Studies\". As commissioner of education in Ireland (1896–1901), trustee of the National Library of Ireland, secretary of the Irish Liberal Union and vice-president of the Irish Unionist Alliance, he enforced his view that literature should not be divorced from practical life. His biographical/critical concepts, particularly in connection with Shakespeare, are played with by Stephen Dedalus in the library chapter of James Joyce's \"Ulysses\". Leslie Fiedler was to play with them again in \"The Stranger in Shakespeare\".\n\nDowden married twice, first (1866) Mary Clerke, and secondly (1895) Elizabeth Dickinson West, daughter of the dean of St Patrick's. His daughter by his first wife, Hester Dowden, was a well-known spiritualist medium.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "416677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=416677", "title": "Ephemera", "text": "Ephemera\n\nEphemera (singular: ephemeron) are any transitory written or printed matter not meant to be retained or preserved. The word derives from the Greek \"ephemeros\", meaning \"lasting only one day, short-lived\". Some collectible ephemera are advertising trade cards, airsickness bags, bookmarks, catalogues, greeting cards, letters, pamphlets, postcards, posters, prospectuses, defunct stock certificates or tickets, and zines.\n\nEphemera (ἐφήμερα) is a noun, the plural neuter of ephemeron and ephemeros, Greek and New Latin for ἐπί – epi \"on, for\" and ἡμέρα – hemera \"day\" with the ancient sense extending to the mayfly and other short lived insects and flowers and for something which lasts a day or a short period of time.\n\nIn library and information science, the term ephemera also describes the class of published single-sheet or single page documents which are meant to be thrown away after one use. This classification excludes simple letters and photographs with no printing on them, which are considered manuscripts or typescripts. Large academic and national libraries and museums may collect, organize, and preserve ephemera as history. A particularly large and important example of such an archive is the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera at the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Over 2,000 images from the John Johnson Collection are available to search online for free at VADS and more than 65,000 items are available online. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards and 450 Valentine's Day cards dating from the early nineteenth century, printed by the major publishers of the day. The Ephemera Kabinett at the Los-Angeles–based Institute of Cultural Inquiry contains 'first' items from cultural turning points of the last two decades, such as a copy of the first Marvel comic in which a lead character comes out of the closet and one of the first AIDS red ribbons.\n\nBy extension, video ephemera and audio ephemera refer to transitory audiovisual matter not intended to be retained or preserved. Surprisingly, the great bulk of video and audio expression has, until recently, been ephemeral. Early TV broadcasts were not preserved (indeed, the technology to preserve them postdates the invention of television). Even if radio and television stations preserve archives of their broadcasts, those backcatalogs are inaccessible in practice to the general public, leaving it to a small number of underground tape traders to exchange the rare, lucky moments when something unexpected or historical came across the air.\n\nAn article on the Ephemera Society of America website notes\nPrinted ephemera gave way to audio and video ephemera in the twentieth century. ... These present even more of a preservation problem than printed materials. Although seldom made available for libraries, when videotapes are acquired for archival preservation they are found to be made on low quality tape, poorly processed, and damaged from abuse by users.\n\nThe large capacity and reach provided by resources such as the Internet Archive and YouTube have made finding and sharing video ephemera (past and present) dramatically easier.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9490321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9490321", "title": "Errors and Expectations", "text": "Errors and Expectations\n\nErrors and Expectations: A Guide for the Teacher of Basic Writing, published in 1977 by Oxford University Press, by Mina P. Shaughnessy, was the first book-length investigation of writing problems experienced by under-prepared college freshmen. At the time of the book’s publication, Shaughnessy was the director of the Instructional Resource Center and an associate dean of CUNY, having previously worked both as a basic writing (BW) instructor and the director of basic writing at City College in New York.\n\nThe book grew out of Shaughnessy’s nine years’ experience teaching basic writing to open admissions students. Overwhelmed by the error-ridden compositions produced by her students, she systematically analyzed 4,000 placement essays written by incoming freshmen at City College in order to better understand the logic of student errors in composition. This research—funded in part by the Carnegie Foundation grant—coupled with her own experience provides the foundation of the book which seeks both to inform basic writing instructors and provide them with a means for approaching their students’ areas of weakness. Perhaps the central and most important observation Shaughnessy makes is that there is a pattern to student error.\n\n\"Errors and Expectations\" devotes a chapter to eight of the (at the time) most salient considerations in basic writing. Each chapter follows a three-pronged format: first, a range of examples; second, an explanation of causes of the problems; and third, suggestions with which to approach the problems. Although more than forty years have passed since the book’s original publication date, the majority of the information remains pertinent and insightful today.\n\nChapter 1: Introduction. Shaughnessy discusses the background of the open admissions movement, detailing her own experience when she begins to grade the essays produced by her first group of open admissions students and finds herself unprepared to proceed in spite of previous years of experience in teaching composition. She also provides a rationale for her focus on error, explaining the realities of academia, the ways in which errors are viewed, and the relationship between reader and writer.\n\nChapter 2: Handwriting and punctuation. After briefly discussing handwriting, the bulk of the chapter (27 of 29 pages) focuses on the myriad ways in which basic writers use and misuse punctuation. In order to understand the logic behind the errors, Shaughnessy explores the concept of the sentence and the differences between spoken and written English. Commas, periods, and capitalization are the primary elements examined.\n\nChapter 3: Syntax. Four general categories of error are examined (accidental errors, blurred patterns, consolidation errors, and inversions) in the context of the academic tone which college students are expected to adopt and with which basic writers often struggle as they expand their writing ability.\n\nChapter 4: Common errors. Shaughnessy provides examples in the primary problem areas of verbs, nouns, pronouns, and subject-verb agreement before discussing the discouragement felt by teachers and students alike as they approach the recurring common errors present in student writing. She offers simple suggestions for reducing error and provides a thorough diagnostic test.\n\nChapter 5: Spelling. Shaughnessy first makes a distinction between misspelling and incorrectly inflecting various parts of speech before classifying spelling mistakes under four heads: problems with the spelling system, incongruities between spoken and written English, ignorance of spelling rules, and the inexperienced eye. She suggests nine steps in addressing spelling problems and warns against two general assumptions—that adult students can’t be taught how to spell correctly and that spelling can only be taught one way.\n\nChapter 6: Vocabulary. Basic writing students enter college without having developed the vocabulary of academia, a slow-growing task that generally takes years to accomplish. Shaughnessy compares the writing of basic, intermediate, and advanced freshman writers to discuss their vocabulary skills and the depth of ideas investigated through vocabulary. She also indicates basic writing students’ needs as they approach vocabulary-rich courses (such as biology or anatomy).\n\nChapter 7: Beyond the sentence. Although many teachers complain that basic writing students lack ideas, Shaughnessy claims that their ideas are hidden by their novice skills and attempts at elaboration. She suggests three needs specific to BW students: how to arrive at a main idea, how to see and create structure in writing, and how to recognize specific patterns that link together sentences and paragraphs.\n\nChapter 8: Expectations. Shaughnessy discusses the powerful link between expectations and achievement, showing sample essays from the beginning and end of a semester course and citing statistics that demonstrate the effectiveness of basic writing courses.\n\nOver 12,000 hardcover copies were sold within six months after it was published (the typical number for a scholarly book with a focused topic was 1,000), and by 1979, more than 40,000 paperback copies had been sold. The book has been cited as one of the most important and influential studies of basic writing, relevant for teachers of both remedial courses and writing in general.\n\nIn more recent years, Shaughnessy’s work has been criticized for a variety of reasons: devoting so much time to grammar instruction; categorizing only the errors of finished products, rather than the errors of each draft; and focusing so completely on error, despite the fact that she herself insists that error correction should not be the only focus of a basic writing course, among others.\n\nMaher, Jane. \"Mina P.

{"id": "10916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10916", "title": "FAQ", "text": "FAQ\n\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ), also Questions and Answers (Q&A), are listed questions and answers, all supposed to be commonly asked in some context, and pertaining to a particular topic. The format is commonly used on email mailing lists and other online forums, where certain common questions tend to recur.\n\n\"FAQ\" is pronounced as either an initialism (F-A-Q) or an acronym. Since the acronym \"FAQ\" originated in textual media, its pronunciation varies; \"F-A-Q\", is commonly heard. Depending on usage, the term may refer specifically to a single frequently asked question, or to an assembled list of many questions and their answers. Web page designers often label a single list of questions as an \"FAQ\", such as on Google.com, while using \"FAQs\" to denote multiple lists of questions such as on United States Treasury sites.\n\nWhile the name may be recent, the FAQ format itself is quite old. For example, Matthew Hopkins wrote \"The Discovery of Witches\" in 1647 as a list of questions and answers, introduced as \"Certain Queries answered\". Many old catechisms are in a question-and-answer (Q&A) format. \"Summa Theologica\", written by Thomas Aquinas in the second half of the 13th century, is a series of common questions about Christianity to which he wrote a series of replies. Plato's dialogues are even older.\n\nThe \"FAQ\" is an Internet textual tradition originating from the technical limitations of early mailing lists from NASA in the early 1980s. The first FAQ developed over several pre-Web years, starting from 1982 when storage was expensive. On ARPANET's SPACE mailing list, the presumption was that new users would download archived past messages through FTP. In practice this rarely happened, and the users tended to post questions to the mailing list instead of searching its archives. Repeating the \"right\" answers became tedious, and went against developing netiquette. A series of different measures were set up by loosely affiliated groups of computer system administrators, from regularly posted messages to netlib-like query email daemons. The acronym \"FAQ\" was developed between 1982 and 1985 by Eugene Miya of NASA for the SPACE mailing list. The format was then picked up on other mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups. Posting frequency changed to monthly, and finally weekly and daily across a variety of mailing lists and newsgroups. The first person to post a weekly FAQ was Jef Poskanzer to the Usenet net.graphics/comp.graphics newsgroups. Eugene Miya experimented with the first daily FAQ.\n\nMeanwhile, on Usenet, Mark Horton had started a series of \"Periodic Posts\" (PP) which attempted to answer trivial questions with appropriate answers. Periodic summary messages posted to Usenet newsgroups attempted to reduce the continual reposting of the same basic questions and associated wrong answers. On Usenet, posting questions which are covered in a group's FAQ came to be considered poor netiquette, as it showed that the poster has not done the expected background reading before asking others to provide answers. Some groups may have multiple FAQs on related topics, or even two or more competing FAQs explaining a topic from different points of view.\n\nAnother factor on early ARPANET mailing lists was people asking questions promising to 'summarize' received answers, then either neglecting to do this or else posting simple concatenations of received replies with little-to-no quality checking.\n\nOriginally the term \"FAQ\" referred to the Frequently Asked Question itself, and the compilation of questions and answers was known as a \"FAQ list\" or some similar expression. The term became more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called a FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually \"frequently\" asked, if they are asked at all, or if there is even any way of asking questions.\n\nIn some cases, informative documents not in the traditional FAQ style have also been described as FAQs, particularly the video game FAQ, which is often a detailed description of gameplay, including tips, secrets, and beginning-to-end guidance. Rarely are videogame FAQs in a question-and-answer format, although they may contain a short section of questions and answers.\n\nOver time, the accumulated FAQs across all Usenet newsgroups sparked the creation of the \"*.answers\" moderated newsgroups such as comp.answers, misc.answers and sci.answers for crossposting and collecting FAQ across respective comp.*, misc.*, sci.* newsgroups.\n\n"}

By this golden bull, King Béla IV proclaimed Gradec a royal free city. The document was issued on 16 November 1242 in Virovitica and reaffirmed in 1266. The original is written on a piece of parchment in size, and is kept in strictly controlled conditions in the Croatian State Archives in Zagreb, while a copy is exhibited in the Zagreb City Museum.\n\nThe Golden Bull declared and proclaimed \"a free royal city on Gradec, the hill of Zagreb\". The town was to be presided by a \"city judge\" (, ), who was elected yearly by the citizenry and fulfilled the role of the mayor. In addition, eight jurors () and twenty city councillors were elected each year on 3 February, the Feast of St. Blaise. Gradec remained ruled by the \"iudex\" until 1850, when Gradec, Kaptol and several other municipalities were formally unified into a new royal city of Zagreb.\n\nThe edict brought many benefits and freedoms to Gradec's inhabitants. Among others, it stated that the towns were subject directly to the King, not to the nobles whose estate they were situated on. This also brought it outside the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Zagreb, which collected revenue from large land holdings, and was headquartered on the neighbouring hill of Kaptol; during the Middle Ages, conflicts would often break out between the citizens of Gradec and canons of Kaptol, sometimes resulting in civil wars. Citizens also gained freedom of movement, free use of their property, and the freedom to freely draw up their own testament. In addition, they were absolved of paying road and bridge tolls in the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom.\n\nIn return for the privileges gained, the citizens were required to erect fortifications around the town at their own expense, which they did in 1266. They were also required to supply the king with \"12 oxen, 1000 loaves of bread and 4 barrels of wine\" in case of a royal visit, and ten armed soldiers in case of war. The latter requirement was repealed by the king in 1266. The citizens also had to provide for a visit by the Duke of Slavonia or Ban of Croatia (only one visit for the Ban).\n\nThe bull also defined the borders of land controlled by Gradec—the city was entitled to land south of the ridge of the Medvednica mountain, west of Vrapčak stream and north of the Sava River.\n\nThe Golden Bull of 1242 was only one in a series of proclamations of royal privileges to towns. In the years preceding the Golden Bull, Mongols had invaded Europe under Batu Khan's command. In early 1241 they reached Hungary, bringing defeat in April that year at the Battle of Mohi on the Sajó River. King Béla IV and the royal family hid from the Mongols in Zagreb. In the winter of 1241–42, Mongols crossed the frozen Drava and Danube rivers. The king fled to Dalmatia as Mongols approached the poorly fortified Zagreb, which they levelled and burnt to the ground. The recently consecrated Zagreb Cathedral was razed by the invading army. The Mongol army continued pursuing Béla until March, when the word of Great Khan Ögedei's death reached them, and they retreated to Central Asia. Following the cease of hostilities, and in anticipation of a new invasion, Béla IV issued dozens of privileges encouraging the building of fortified urban settlements, as these turned out to be the only viable holdouts during the war.\n\nHelped by its location at the intersection of two important trade routes, the new town of Gradec—protected by stone walls, unlike its neighbour Kaptol—reached a population of around 3,000 in the 14th century, which made it a sizable city in then largely rural Central Europe. It was also a financial centre of the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom, as it held a silver mint, and was the base of the thirtieth tax collection in Slavonia, a major source of employment for the town. In 1267, the citizens of Gradec were absolved of paying the thirtieth. As a royal free city, Gradec was also allowed to hold daily and weekly tax-free fairs, as well as a fortnightly fair around the Feast of St. Mark (held from 17 April to 3 May), which was first held in 1256, on St. Mark's Square. The St. Mark's fair was revived at the turn of the 21st century, and continues in the present day. \n\nIn 1992, the city of Zagreb celebrated the 750th anniversary of the Golden Bull. An exhibition was held by the Zagreb City Museum and the to commemorate this occasion.\n\n\n"}

The bracelets might have been produced by Norse settlers in Dublin and possibly buried for safekeeping by Viking refugees settling in Cheshire and the Wirral in the early 900's. It was discovered by Steve Reynoldson in November 2004 after he found fragments of lead underground using a metal detector.\n\nThe bracelets were folded flat, sixteen decorated by punched patterns, six with crosses stamped in their centre, and another six with centre cross and one at each end.

A Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £45,000 enabled its purchase by joint owners Grosvenor Museum, Cheshire Museums Service and National Museums Liverpool, which have it on display at the Museum of Liverpool.

{"id": "39975978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39975978", "title": "Intermingling", "text": "Intermingling\n\nIntermingling, or heterophily, from a sociological perspective includes the various forms of interactions between individuals that go against a particular society's cultural norms. These relationships stem from weak or absent ties, which are contrary to strong ties and constitute of networks between individuals who know little or nothing about one another. Examples of intermingling can include networking, work-place romance, or cross-cultural dating.\n\nIntermingling is the opposite of homophily and xenophobia but individuals tend to be less heterophilic and more homophilic- associating and bonding with individuals similar to themselves. Homophily is more prevalent than heterophily because the strength of all ties between any two people depend on the amount of time spent together, of mutual confiding, and of emotional intensity. Homophilic relationships are perceived to be easier to build and maintain as individuals feel they have a great deal in common.\nPertaining to the diffusion of relationships, intermingling and heterophily are perceived to create more damage. Thus, since individuals practice homophily tend to be strongly connected and hold strong ties between their groups, when an individual is removed from the group information is still passed easily among those who remain. Contrarily, in sectors where there is intermingling and the group fabricates weak ties and bridges (individuals who connect two strangers) the removal of an individual from this group threatens the continuation of relationships between the others left in the group.\n\nPersonal networks and business networks are the social circles individuals find themselves within that are made up of strong and weak ties. The goal of these networks is to exchange information, act upon new opportunities, and have personal gain from the relationship. Intermingling has been known to enhance individuals' networking practices as heterophily is said to make people more successful through them being able to receive new information from weak ties. This conclusion comes from the observation of those who are perceived to be privileged and unprivileged (based on race, class, and gender) and how much in comparison to the other each group intermingles thus creating weak ties. The unprivileged groups (i.e. women, minorities, and lower classes) tend to be in small cliques with a very limited amount of weak ties meaning that their access to new opportunities and information is also limited. These groups have been known to only interact with each other causing information to be trapped within their own circle and no new information to enter into the circle. In Stanley Milgram's Small World Problem this breach in the spread of new information is described as group inbreeding.\n\nAccording to Mark Granovetter in his work the Strength of Weak Ties, intermingling is necessary in gaining access to new opportunities and personal gain as weak ties increase an individuals exposure to new information. Additionally, Granovetter's work found that information diffuses (spreads) more quickly and further when the network is made up of weak ties and bridges (individuals who connect two strangers). This is benefiting to individuals as information usually contain information on employment, business opportunities, and new ventures.\n\nIntermingling is a term sometimes used to refer to several different ideas regarding how people connect in love intermarriage, cultural assimilation, miscegenation (racial mixing). Note that the history of cultural exchange and inter-societal conflict has produced terms for \"intermingling\" concepts which are colored by various cultural and societal norms such as xenophobia and racism.\n\nIntermingling in the workplace is considered and commonly called workplace romance. Intermingling within the workplace is considered a sexual attraction between two individuals who work within the same organization and the relationship is perceived within the eyes of a third party. Workplace romance is deemed a form of intermingling because they are usually not approved or allowed by company officials leading it to be taboo dating practice.The interactions that take place within the workplace are romantically charges as both individuals are voluntarily involved and the mingling that takes place is not forced or unwanted. Additionally the individuals are officially labeled as more than just co-workers once they act physically on their mutual romantic feelings for each other. This may come in the form of dating or casual sex.\n\nConfirmation of intermingling within the workplace context also must support Sternberg's triangular theory of love which states that loving relationships consist of three components; intimacy (which attracts the individuals to each other), passion (which causes the need to express feelings through physical attention and sexual intercourse), and commitment (which leads to the individuals deciding to stick with each other).\n\nRelationships formed within the workplace are one of three types; hierarchical, lateral, or couples without direct interaction in their job description.\n\nRelationships that are hierarchal within the place of employment happen when the involved individuals do not hold the same power in the context of their work. One individual's job position is seen as subordinate when compared to their significant other's position within the same company. Famous examples of hierarchal romances include Bill Gates (CEO of Microsoft) and Melinda French (previous Product Manager of Microsoft), President Barack Obama (previous Summer Associate at Sidley Austin - Chicago Branch) and Michelle Robinson (Barack's Summer Mentor/Advisor) \"see Obama - Family Life\", and the notorious romance between President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky (White House Intern) see Lewinsky scandal.\n\nRelationships that are lateral within the workplace are formed when the involved individuals are seen as holding equally powerful positions in their job descriptions. Persons participating in a lateral workplace romance can not be seen as superior or subordinate to one another.\n\nLeaders of organizations favor lateral relationships more than hierarchal relationships even though neither are fully supported. The dynamics of hierarchal relationships within the work context can possibly lead to a higher number of claims of sexual harassment. The Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson case, which claimed that workplace romances are not excluded in the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, established that employers are responsible for the actions executed to their employees by the power-holding leaders of the institution.\n\nAlso, hierarchal relationships can lead to conflict as the subordinate individual begins to be viewed by their co-workers as more favored than their equals. This favor is symbolized through pay raises, promotions, transfers, work load discrepancies and it usually leads to co-workers envying one another or carrying feelings of inequality.\n\nCouples who work for the same institution but have no direct interaction during their tasks at work may be two individuals who work in different departments or different sites. This form of dating stirs even less suspicions of favoritism than lateral and hierarchical forms of dating.\n"}

They contain orders on what action to take in the event that an enemy nuclear strike has destroyed the British government and has killed or otherwise incapacitated both the prime minister and the \"second person\" (normally a high-ranking member of the Cabinet) whom the prime minister has designated to make a decision on how to act in the event of the prime minister's death. In the event that the orders were to be carried out, the action taken could be the last official act of Her Majesty's Government.\n\nThe letters are stored inside two nested safes in the control room of each submarine. The letters are destroyed unopened after a prime minister leaves office, so their content remains known only to the prime minister who issued them.\n\nThe letters are written as soon as a new prime minister takes office, after being told by the Chief of the Defence Staff \"precisely what damage a Trident missile could cause\". These are then delivered to the submarines, with the previous prime minister's letters being destroyed without being opened.\n\nIn the event of the deaths of both the prime minister and the designated alternative decision-maker as a result of a nuclear strike, the commander(s) of the nuclear submarine(s) (at any time at least one is on patrol) would use a series of checks to ascertain whether the letters of last resort will have to be opened.\n\nAccording to Peter Hennessy's book \"The Secret State: Whitehall and the Cold War, 1945 to 1970\", the process by which a commander would determine if the British government continues to function includes, amongst other checks, establishing whether BBC Radio 4 continues broadcasting.\n\nIn 1983, the procedure for Polaris submarines was to open the envelopes if there was an evident nuclear attack, or if all UK naval broadcasts had ceased for four hours.\n\nWhile the contents of these letters are secret, according to the December 2008 BBC Radio 4 documentary \"The Human Button\", there were four known options given to the prime minister to include in the letters. The prime minister instructs the submarine commander to:\n\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported in 2016 that the options are said to include: \"Put yourself under the command of the US, if it is still there\", \"Go to Australia\", \"Retaliate\", or \"Use your own judgement\".\n\nThe actual option chosen remains known only to the writer of the letter, as they are destroyed unopened when a Prime Minister leaves office. In a debate prior to the 2017 general election the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong anti-nuclear weapons campaigner, stated that he would write the letters of last resort if elected but did not state what option he would choose, while also saying that any use of nuclear weapons would be a “disaster”.\n\nDavid Greig's 2012 play \"The Letter of Last Resort\" deals with the consequences and paradoxes of the letters.\n\nThe play was first staged in February 2012 as a part of a cycle of plays on \"The Bomb\" at the Tricycle Theatre in London, directed by Nicolas Kent, with Belinda Lang playing the role of the incoming prime minister and Simon Chandler her advisor. The production was also seen at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, for the Edinburgh Fringe later the same year. The following year it was broadcast on BBC Radio 4, with the same cast, first transmitted on 1 June 2013.\n\nThe KGB's attempts to obtain the contents of the letters of last resort are part of the plot of the BBC Cold War spy drama \"The Game\" (2014).\n\n\n"}

Gibson's early short fiction is recognized as cyberpunk's finest work, effectively renovating the science fiction genre which had been hitherto considered widely insignificant.\n\nAt the turn of the 1990s, after the completion of his Sprawl trilogy of novels, Gibson contributed the text to a number of performance art pieces and exhibitions, as well as writing lyrics for musicians Yellow Magic Orchestra and Debbie Harry. He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book \"Agrippa (a book of the dead)\" in 1992 before co-authoring \"The Difference Engine\", an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the steampunk genre. He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood screenwriter, with few of his projects seeing the light of day and those that did being critically unsuccessful.\n\nAlthough he had largely abandoned short fiction by the mid-1990s, Gibson returned to writing novels, completing his second trilogy, the Bridge trilogy at the close of the millennium.

To the north is the British Museum, hence its current name. The street is populated by cafes and bookshops to appeal to the international museum-going public. To the north is Great Russell Street. To the south are Bloomsbury Way and New Oxford Street. The nearest tube stations are Tottenham Court Road and Holborn to the southwest and southeast respectively.\n\nThe street goes back to the 14th century and beyond. It remained largely rural until the late 17th century when the growth of London caused its urbanisation. \n\nKnown as a thoroughfare since records began, it soon came to be known as \"Peter Street\". The origins of this name are unsure though scholars agree it is unlikely to have been an eminent Peter (notwithstanding perhaps St Peter) and more probable it derives from a saltpetre manufactory which is thought to have existed there long before the British Museum opened in the 1750s. During the early years the street was the site of hovels of slum tenements and rather unsavoury characters such as pickpockets and prostitutes. An attempt at gentrification saw its name changed to \"Queen Street\" and it became home to parish schools to ensure the spiritual and secular education of poor children in London. Around this time Charles Mudie opened his bookshop and stationers here, he soon explored the possibility of lending books as well as selling them and \"Mudie's Select Library\" proved so popular that it moved out to larger premises after ten years. The street also became a rather fashionable area with many of the foremost writers of the day gathering in taverns to converse and debate. Charles Dickens drank here when he was dedicating his energy to amateur dramatics, John Keats, George Orwell and the Bloomsbury Set were also patrons.\n\nOn the corner of Great Russell Street at the northern end is the Museum Tavern, a public house that traces its origins back to 1723. From 1723 to 1762 the pub was called the \"Dog and Duck\" (so called because duck hunting was popular in the ponds in the Long Fields behind Montagu House in the 17th and 18th centuries). The occult Atlantis Bookshop was opened on the street in 1922.\n\nMore recent history has seen the street set up as a paragon for pedestrian access. Camden's 2003, \"Car Free Day\" saw the streetscape give right of way to foot passengers — a success which was heralded across Europe as an example of best practice in cutting vehicular noise and pollution.\n"}
{"id": "22518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22518", "title": "Orthodox Judaism", "text": "Orthodox Judaism\n\nOrthodox Judaism is a collective term for the traditionalist branches of contemporary Judaism. Theologically, it is chiefly defined by regarding the Torah, both Written and Oral, as literally revealed by God on Mount Sinai and faithfully transmitted ever since. Orthodox Judaism therefore advocates a strict observance of Jewish Law, or \"Halakha\", which is to be interpreted only according to received methods and canonical sources, due to its divine origin. It regards the entire \"halakhic\" system as the unfolding and application of an immutable revelation, essentially beyond external and historical influence. Other key doctrines include belief in a future resurrection of the dead, divine reward and punishment, the Election of Israel and an eventual restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem under the Messiah.\n\nOrthodox Judaism is not a centralized denomination. Relations between its different subgroups are sometimes strained, and the exact limits of Orthodoxy are subject to intense debate. Very roughly, it may be divided between Ultra-Orthodox or \"Haredi\", which is more conservative, and Modern Orthodox Judaism which is relatively open to outer society. Each of those is itself formed of independent streams. While adhering to traditional beliefs, the movement is a modern phenomenon. It arose as a result of the breakdown of the autonomous Jewish community since the 18th century, and was much shaped by a conscious struggle against the pressures of secularization and rival alternatives. \n\nThe strictly observant and theologically aware Orthodox are a definite minority among all Jews, but there are also numerous semi- and non-practicing persons who are officially affiliated or personally identifying with the movement. In total, Orthodox Judaism is the largest Jewish religious group, estimated to have over 2 million practicing adherents and at least an equal number of nominal members or self-identifying supporters.\n\nThe earliest known mentioning of the term \"Orthodox Jews\" was made in the Berlinische Monatsschrift in 1795. The word \"Orthodox\" was borrowed from the general German Enlightenment discourse, and used not to denote a specific religious group, but rather those Jews who opposed Enlightenment. During the early and mid-19th century, with the advent of the progressive movements among German Jews and especially early Reform Judaism, the title \"Orthodox\" became the epithet of the traditionalists who espoused conservative positions on the issues raised by modernization. They themselves often disliked the alien, Christian name, preferring titles like \"Torah-true\" (\"gesetztreu\"), and often declared they used it only for the sake of convenience. The Orthodox leader Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch referred to \"the conviction commonly designated as Orthodox Judaism\"; in 1882, when Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer became certain that the public understood that his philosophy and Liberal Judaism were radically different, he removed the word \"Orthodox\" from the name of his Rabbinical Seminary. By the 1920s, the term became common and accepted even in Eastern Europe, and remains as such.\n\nOrthodoxy perceives itself ideologically as the only authentic continuation of Judaism throughout the ages, as it was until the crisis of modernity; in many basic aspects, such as belief in the unadulterated divinity of the Torah or strict adherence to precedent and tradition when ruling in matters of Jewish Law, Orthodoxy is indeed so. Its progressive opponents often shared this view, regarding it as a fossilized remnant of the past and lending credit to their own rivals' ideology. Thus, the term \"Orthodox\" is often used generically to refer to traditional (even if only at the default sense, of being unrelated to the modernist non-Orthodox movements) synagogues, prayer rites, observances, and so forth.\n\nHowever, academic research has taken a more nuanced approach, noting that the formation of Orthodox ideology and organizational frameworks was itself a product of modernity. It was brought about by the need to defend and buttress the very concept of tradition, in a world where it was not self-evident anymore. When deep secularization and the dismantlement of communal structures uprooted the old order of Jewish life, traditionalist elements united to form groups which had a distinct self-understanding. This, and all that it entailed, constituted a great change, for the Orthodox had to adapt to the new circumstances no less than anyone else; they developed novel, sometimes radically so, means of action and modes of thought. \"Orthodoxization\" was a contingent process, drawing from local circumstances and dependent on the extent of threat sensed by its proponents: a sharply-delineated Orthodox identity appeared in Central Europe, in Germany and Hungary, by the 1860s; a less stark one emerged in Eastern Europe during the Interwar period. Among the Jews of the Muslim lands, similar processes on a large scale only occurred around the 1970s, after they immigrated to Israel. Orthodoxy is often described as extremely conservative, ossifying a once-dynamic tradition due to the fear of legitimizing change. While this was not rarely true, its defining feature was not the forbidding of change and \"freezing\" Jewish heritage in its tracks, but rather the need to adapt to being but one segment of Judaism in a modern world inhospitable to traditional practice. Orthodoxy developed as a variegated \"spectrum of reactions\" – as termed by Benjamin Brown – involving in many cases much accommodation and leniency. Scholars nowadays, mainly since the mid-1980's, research Orthodox Judaism as a field in itself, examining how the need to confront modernity shaped and changed its beliefs, ideologies, social structure, and \"halakhic\" rulings, making it very much distinct from traditional Jewish society.\n\nA definite and conclusive credo was never formulated in Judaism; the very question whether it contains any equivalent of dogma is a matter of intense scholarly controversy. Some researchers attempted to argue that the importance of daily practice and punctilious adherence to \"halakha\" (Jewish law) relegated theoretical issues to an ancillary status. Others dismissed this view entirely, citing the debates in ancient rabbinic sources which castigated various heresies without any reference to observance. However, while lacking a uniform doctrine, Orthodox Judaism is basically united in affirming several core beliefs, disavowal of which is considered major blasphemy. As in other aspects, Orthodox positions reflect the mainstream of traditional Rabbinic Judaism through the ages.\n\nAttempts to codify these beliefs were undertaken by several medieval authorities, including Saadia Gaon and Joseph Albo. Each composed his own creed. Yet the 13 principles expounded by Maimonides in his \"Commentary on the Mishna\", authored in the 1160s, eventually proved the most widely accepted. Various points – for example, Albo listed merely three fundamentals, and did not regard the Messiah as a key tenet – the exact formulation, and the status of disbelievers (whether mere errants or heretics who can no longer be considered part of the People Israel) were contested by many of Maimonides' contemporaries and later sages. But in recent centuries, the 13 principles became standard, and are considered binding and cardinal by Orthodox authorities in a virtually universal manner.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, two systems of thought competed for theological primacy, their advocates promoting them as explanatory foundations for observance of the Law. One was the rationalist-philosophic school, which endeavored to present all commandments as serving higher moral and ethical purposes, while the other was the mystical tradition, exemplified in \"Kabbalah\", which assigned each rite with a role in the hidden dimensions of reality. Sheer obedience, without much thought and derived from faithfulness to one's community and ancestry, was believed fit only for the common people, while the educated classes chose either of the two schools. In the modern era, the prestige of both suffered severe blows, and \"naive faith\" became popular. At a time when excessive contemplation in matters of belief was associated with secularization, luminaries such as Israel Meir Kagan stressed the importance of simple, unsophisticated commitment to the precepts passed down from the Beatified Sages. This is still the standard in the ultra-Orthodox world.\n\nIn more open Orthodox circles, attempts were made to formulate philosophies that would confront modern sensibilities. Notable examples are the Hegelian-Kabbalistic theology of Abraham Isaac Kook, who viewed history as progressing toward a Messianic redemption in a dialectic fashion which required the strengthening of heretical forces, or the existentialist thought of Joseph B. Soloveitchik, who was deeply influenced by Neo-Kantian ideals. On the fringes of Orthodoxy, thinkers who were at least (and according to their critics, only) sociologically part of it, ventured toward radical models. These, like the apopathic views of Yeshayahu Leibowitz or the Feminist interpretation of Tamar Ross, had little to no influence on the mainstream.\n\nOrthodox Jews are likely to write the name of this section with a dash: G-d.\n\nOrthodox Judaism affirms monotheism, the belief in one, and only one, deity. This is said several times per day in the prayers, including those said when going to sleep (men and women, girls and boys).\n\nThe basic tenets, drawn from ancient sources like the Talmud as well as later sages, include the attributes of God in Judaism: one and indivisible, preceding all creation which he alone brought into being, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, absolutely incorporeal, and beyond human reason. Maimonides delineated this understanding of a monotheistic, personal God in six articles concerning his status as the sole creator, his oneness, his impalpability, that he is first and last, that God alone may be worshipped, and no other being, and that he is omniscient.\n\nThe defining doctrine of Orthodox Judaism is the belief that the Law, both Written and Oral, was revealed by God to Moses on Mount Sinai, and that the Law was transmitted faithfully from Sinai in an unbroken chain ever since. One of the foundational texts of Rabbinic tradition is the list opening the Ethics of the Fathers, enumerating the sages who received and passed on the Torah, from Moses through Joshua, the Elders, and Prophets, and then onward until Hillel the Elder and Shammai.\n\nThe basic philosophy of Orthodoxy is that the body of revelation is total and complete; its interpretation under new circumstances, required of scholars in every generation, is conceived as an act of inferring and elaborating based on already prescribed methods, not of innovation or addition. One clause in the Jerusalem Talmud asserts that anything which a veteran disciple shall teach was already given at Sinai; and a story in the Babylonian Talmud claims that upon seeing the immensely intricate deduction of future Rabbi Akiva in a vision, Moses himself was at loss until Akiva proclaimed that everything he teaches was handed over to Moses. Lacunae in received tradition or disagreements between early sages are attributed to disruptions, especially persecutions which caused to that \"the Torah was forgotten in Israel\" — according to Rabbinic lore, these eventually compelled the legists to write down the Oral Law in the Mishna and Talmud — but the wholeness of the original divine message and the reliability of those who transmitted it through the ages are axiomatic.\n\nOrthodox Judaism now includes opinions on eschatology which, in past centuries, were not mainstream views in Judaism. The prophecy of the coming of a Messiah is now central to Orthodox Judaism. According to this doctrine, a Messiah will arise from King David's lineage, and will bring with him signs such as the restoration of the Temple, peace, and universal acceptance of God.\nThe Messiah will embark on a quest to gather all Jews to the Holy Land, will proclaim prophethood, and will restore the Davidic Monarchy.\n\nClassical Judaism did incorporate a tradition of belief in the resurrection of the dead. There is scriptural basis for this doctrine, quoted by the Mishnah: \"All Israelites have a share in the World-to-Come, as it is written: \"And your people, all of them righteous, Shall possess the land for all time; They are the shoot that I planted, My handiwork in which I glory\" (Isa 60:21).\" The Mishnah also brands as heretics any Jew who rejects the doctrine of resurrection or its origin from the Torah. Those who deny the doctrine are deemed to receive no share in the World-to-Come. The Pharisees believed in both a bodily resurrection and the immortality of the soul. They also believed that acts in this world would effect the state of life in the next world. The Mishnah \"Sahendrin\" 10 clarifies that only those who follow the correct theology will have a place in the World to Come.\n\nThere are other passing references to the afterlife in mishnaic tractates. A particularly important one in the \"Berakhot\" informs that the Jewish belief in the afterlife was established long before the compilation of the Mishnah. Biblical tradition categorically mentions Sheol sixty-five times. It is described as an underworld containing the gathering of the dead with their families. Numbers 16:30 states that Korah went into Sheol alive, to describe his death in divine retribution. The deceased who reside in Sheol have a \"nebulous\" existence and there is no reward or punishment in Sheol, which is represented as a dark and gloomy place. But a distinction is made for kings who are said to be greeted by other kings when entering Sheol. Biblical poetry suggests that resurrection from Sheol is possible. Prophetic narratives of resurrection in the Bible have been labelled as external cultural influence by some scholars.\n\nThe Talmudic discourse expanded on the details of the World to Come. This was to motivate Jewish compliance with their religious codes. In brief, the righteous will be rewarded with a place in Gan Eden, the wicked will be punished in Gehinnom, and the resurrection will take place in the Messianic age. The sequence of these events is unclear. Rabbis have supported the concept of resurrection with plenteous Biblical citations and shown it as a sign of God's omnipotence.\nFor guidance in practical application of Jewish law, the majority of Orthodox Jews appeal to the Shulchan Aruch (\"Code of Jewish Law\" composed in the 16th century by Rabbi Joseph Karo), together with its surrounding commentaries. Thus, at a general level, there is a large degree of uniformity amongst all Orthodox Jews. Concerning the details, however, there is often variance: decisions may be based on various of the standardized codes of Jewish Law that have been developed over the centuries, as well as on the various \"responsa\". These codes and responsa may differ from each other as regards detail (and reflecting the above philosophical differences, as regards the weight assigned to these). By and large, however, the differences result from the historic dispersal of the Jews and the consequent development of differences among regions in their practices (see minhag).\n\n\nOrthodox Judaism emphasizes practicing rules of \"kashrut\", Shabbat, family purity, and \"tefilah\" (daily prayer). Many Orthodox Jews can be identified by their manner of dress and family lifestyle. Orthodox men and women dress modestly by keeping most of their skin covered. Married women cover their hair, most commonly in the form of a scarf, also in the form of hats, snoods, berets, or, sometimes, wigs. Orthodox men wear a skullcap known as a \"kipa\", and often fringes called \"tzitzit\". Many men grow beards, and Haredi men wear black hats (with a \"kipa\" underneath) and suits. Modern Orthodox Jews are sometimes indistinguishable in their dress from those around them, although they too wear \"kipa\"s and \"tzitzit\"; additionally, on Shabbat, Modern Orthodox men wear suits (or at least a dress shirt) and dress pants, while women wear fancier dresses or blouses.\n\nAlong with these practices, Orthodox Jews practice the laws of \"negiah\", which means touch. Orthodox men and women do not engage in physical contact with those of the opposite sex outside of their spouse, or immediate family members (such as parents, siblings, and children).\n\nThe roots of Orthodox Judaism can be traced to the late 18th or early 19th century, when elements within German Jewry sought to reform Jewish belief and practice in the early 19th century in response to the Age of Enlightenment, Jewish Emancipation, and \"Haskalah\". The Haskalah movement sought to modernize education in light of contemporary scholarship. They rejected claims of the absolute divine authorship of the Torah, declaring only biblical laws concerning ethics to be binding, and stated that the rest of \"halakha\" (Jewish law) need not be viewed as normative for Jews in wider society. (see Reform Judaism).\n\nIn reaction to the emergence of Reform Judaism, a group of traditionalist German Jews emerged in support of some of the values of the Haskalah, but also wanted to defend the classic, traditional interpretation of Jewish law and tradition. This group was led by those who opposed the establishment of a new temple in Hamburg [1819], as reflected in the booklet \"Ele Divrei HaBerit\". As a group of Reform Rabbis convened in Braunschweig, Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger of Altona published a manifesto entitled \"Shlomei Emunei Yisrael\" in German and Hebrew, having 177 Rabbis sign on. At this time, the first Orthodox Jewish periodical, \"Der Treue Zions Waechter\", was launched with the Hebrew supplement \"Shomer Zion HaNe'eman\" [1845 - 1855]. In later years, it was Rav Ettlinger's students Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch and Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer of Berlin who deepened the awareness and strength of Orthodox Jewry. Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch commented in 1854:It was not the \"Orthodox\" Jews who introduced the word \"Orthodoxy\" into Jewish discussion. It was the modern \"progressive\" Jews who first applied this name to \"old\", \"backward\" Jews as a derogatory term. This name was at first resented by \"old\" Jews. And rightly so. \"Orthodox\" Judaism does not know any varieties of Judaism. It conceives Judaism as one and indivisible. It does not know a Mosaic, prophetic, and rabbinic Judaism, nor Orthodox and Liberal Judaism. It only knows Judaism and non-Judaism. It does not know Orthodox and Liberal Jews. It does indeed know conscientious and indifferent Jews, good Jews, bad Jews, or baptized Jews; all, nevertheless, Jews with a mission which they cannot cast off. They are only distinguished accordingly as they fulfill or reject their mission. (Samson Raphael Hirsch, Religion Allied to Progress, in JMW. p. 198) Hirsch held the opinion that Judaism demands an application of Torah thought to the entire realm of human experience, including the secular disciplines. His approach was termed the \"Torah im Derech Eretz\" approach, or \"neo-Orthodoxy\". While insisting on strict adherence to Jewish beliefs and practices, he held that Jews should attempt to engage and influence the modern world, and encouraged those secular studies compatible with Torah thought. This pattern of religious and secular involvement has been evident at many times in Jewish history. Scholars believe it was characteristic of the Jews in Babylon during the Amoraic and Geonic periods, and likewise in early medieval Spain, shown by their engagement with both Muslim and Christian society. It appeared as the traditional response to cultural and scientific innovation.\n\nTraditionalist and reformist Jews in the middle of the nineteenth century had a consensus that the \"Orthodox\" label was inappropriate. Reformists even referred to the Orthodox as \"der so genannte Orthodoxen\" (\"the so-called Orthodox\"). The traditionalists blamed the reformists for causing this label to come about by drawing a distinction between themselves and those Jews who adhered to the old ways.\n\nSome scholars believe that Modern Orthodoxy arose from the religious and social realities of Western European Jewry. While non-Orthodox Jews consider Modern Orthodoxy traditional today, some (the Haredi/Hasidic groups) within the Orthodox community consider some elements to be of questionable validity. The neo-Orthodox movement holds that Hirsch's views are not accurately followed by Modern Orthodoxy. [See Torah im Derech Eretz and Torah Umadda \"Relationship with Torah im Derech Eretz\" for a more extensive listing.]\n\nContemporary Orthodox Jews believe that they adhere to the same basic philosophy and legal framework that has existed throughout Jewish history, whereas the other denominations depart from it. Orthodox Judaism, as it exists today, is an outgrowth that claims to extend from the time of Moses, to the time of the \"Mishnah\" and Talmud, through the development of oral law and rabbinic literature, until the present time. For some, Orthodox Judaism has been seen as a continuation of what was the mainstream expression of Judaism prior to the 19th century.\n\nHowever, the Orthodox claim to absolute fidelity to past tradition has been challenged by modern scholars who contend that the Judaism of the Middle Ages bore little resemblance to that practiced by today's Orthodox. Rather, the Orthodox community, as a counterreaction to the liberalism of the Haskalah movement, began to embrace far more stringent halachic practices than their predecessors, most notably in matters of Kashrut and Passover dietary laws, where the strictest possible interpretation becomes a religious requirement, even where the Talmud explicitly prefers a more lenient position, and even where a more lenient position was practiced by prior generations.\n\nJewish historians also note that certain customs of today's Orthodox are not continuations of past practice, but instead represent innovations that would have been unknown to prior generations. For example, the now-widespread \"Haredi\" tradition of cutting a boy's hair for the first time on his third birthday (\"upshirin\" or \"upsheerin\", Yiddish for \"haircut\") \"originated as an Arab custom that parents cut a newborn boy's hair and burned it in a fire as a sacrifice\", and \"Jews in Palestine learned this custom from Arabs and adapted it to a special Jewish context\". The Ashkenazi prohibition against eating \"kitniyot\" (grains and legumes such as rice, corn, beans, and peanuts) during Passover was explicitly rejected in the Talmud, has no known precedent before the 12th century, and represented a minority position for hundreds of years thereafter, but nonetheless has remained a mandatory prohibition among Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews due to their historic adherence to ReMA's rulings in the Shulchan Aruch.\n\nIn practice, the emphasis on strictness has resulted in the rise of \"homogeneous enclaves\" with other Haredi Jews that are less likely to be threatened by assimilation and intermarriage, or even to interact with other Jews who do not share their doctrines. Nevertheless, this strategy has proved successful, and the number of adherents to Orthodox Judaism, including Haredi and Hasidic communities, has grown rapidly.\n\nIn 1915, Yeshiva College (later Yeshiva University) and its Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary was established in New York City for training in an Orthodox milieu. A school branch was established in Los Angeles, California.\n\nA number of other influential Orthodox seminaries, many of them Haredi, were established throughout the country, most notably in New York; Baltimore, Maryland; and Chicago, Illinois. Beth Medrash Govoha, the Haredi yeshiva in Lakewood, New Jersey, is the largest Talmudic academy in the United States, with a student body of over 5,000 students.\n\nOrthodox Judaism is heterogeneous, whereby subgroups maintain significant social differences, and less significant differences in understanding Halakha. What unifies various groups under the \"Orthodox\" umbrella is the central belief that Torah, including the Oral Law, was given directly from God to Moses at Mount Sinai and applies in all times and places. As a result, all Orthodox Jews are required to live in accordance with the Commandments and Jewish law.\n\nSince there is no one Orthodox body, there is no one canonical statement of principles. Rather, each Orthodox group claims to be a non-exclusive heir to the received tradition of Jewish theology. Many groups have affirmed a literal acceptance of Maimonides' thirteen principles.\n\nGiven this (relative) philosophic flexibility, variant viewpoints are possible, particularly in areas not explicitly demarcated by the Halakha. The result is a relatively broad range of \"hashqafoth\" (Sing. \"hashkafa\" – world view, Weltanschauung) within Orthodoxy. The greatest differences within strains of Orthodoxy involve the following issues:\n\n\nBased on their philosophy and doctrine vis-a-vis these core issues, adherents to Orthodoxy can roughly be divided into the subgroups of Modern Orthodox Judaism and Haredi Judaism, with Hasidic Jewish groups falling into the latter category.\n\nIn general, Modern Orthodoxy's \"overall approach ... is the belief that one can and should be a full member of modern society, accepting the risks to remaining observant, because the benefits outweigh those risks\". Jews should engage constructively with the world that they are in to foster goodness and justice within both themselves and the larger community, such as by avoiding sin in their personal lives while also caring for the unfortunate.\n\nThus, Modern Orthodoxy holds that Jewish law is normative and binding, while simultaneously attaching a positive value to interaction with the modern world. In this view, as expressed by Rabbi Saul Berman, Orthodox Judaism can \"be enriched\" by its intersection with modernity; further, \"modern society creates opportunities to be productive citizens engaged in the Divine work of transforming the world to benefit humanity\". At the same time, in order to preserve the integrity of halakha, any area of \"powerful inconsistency and conflict\" between Torah and modern culture must be filtered out.\n\nModern Orthodoxy also assigns a central role to the \"People of Israel\". Here two characteristics are manifest: In general, Modern Orthodoxy places a high national, as well as religious, significance on the State of Israel, and institutions and individuals are, typically, Zionist in orientation; relatedly, involvement with non-Orthodox Jews will extend beyond \"outreach\" to include institutional relations and cooperation.\n\nOther \"core beliefs\" are a recognition of the value and importance of secular studies (see Torah Umadda:Torah and secular knowledge), a commitment to equality of education for both men and women, and a full acceptance of the importance of being able to financially support oneself and one's family.\n\nHaredi Judaism is a broad spectrum of groups within Orthodox Judaism, all characterized by a rejection of modern secular culture. Its members are often referred to as \"strictly Orthodox\" or \"ultra-Orthodox\" in English, although the term \"ultra-Orthodox\" is considered pejorative by many of its adherents. Haredim regard themselves as the most religiously authentic group of Jews, although this claim is contested by other streams.\n\nHaredi Judaism is a reaction to societal changes, including emancipation, enlightenment, the \"Haskalah\" movement derived from enlightenment, acculturation, secularization, religious reform in all its forms from mild to extreme, the rise of the Jewish national movements, etc. In contrast to Modern Orthodox Judaism, which hastened to embrace modernity, the approach of the Haredim was to maintain a steadfast adherence both to Jewish Law and custom by segregating themselves from modern society. However, there are many Haredi communities in which getting a professional degree or establishing a business is encouraged, and contact exists between Haredi and non-Haredi Jews, as well as between Haredim and non-Jews.\n\nHaredi communities are primarily found in Israel, North America, and Western Europe. Their estimated global population currently numbers 1.5–1.8 million, and, due to a virtual absence of interfaith marriage and a high birth rate, their numbers are growing rapidly. Their numbers have also been boosted by a substantial number of secular Jews adopting a Haredi lifestyle as part of the Baal teshuva movement.\n\nHasidic Judaism, or \"Chasidism\", arose as a spiritual revival movement in contemporary Western Ukraine during the 18th century, and spread rapidly throughout Eastern Europe. Today, most affiliates reside in the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom. Israel Ben Eliezer, the Baal Shem Tov, is regarded as its founding father, and his disciples developed and disseminated it. Present-day Hasidism is a sub-group within Haredi Judaism, and is noted for its religious conservatism and social seclusion. Its members adhere closely both to Orthodox Jewish practice – with the movement's own unique emphases – and the traditions of Eastern European Jews, so much so that many of the latter, including various special styles of dress and the use of the Yiddish language, are nowadays associated almost exclusively with Hasidism.\n\nHasidic thought draws heavily on Lurianic Kabbalah, and, to an extent, is a popularization of it. Teachings emphasize God's immanence in the universe, the need to cleave and be one with Him at all times, the devotional aspect of religious practice, and the spiritual dimension of corporeality and mundane acts. \"Hasidim\", the adherents of Hasidism, are organized in independent sects known as \"courts\" or dynasties, each headed by its own hereditary leader, a \"Rebbe\". Reverence and submission to the \"Rebbe\" are key tenets, as he is considered a spiritual authority with whom the follower must bond to gain closeness to God. The various \"courts\" share basic convictions, but operate apart, and possess unique traits and customs. Affiliation is often retained in families for generations, and being Hasidic is as much a sociological factor – entailing, as it does, birth into a specific community and allegiance to a dynasty of \"Rebbe\"s – as it is a purely religious one. There are several \"courts\" with many thousands of member households each, and hundreds of smaller ones. The total number of Hasidim, both adults and children, is estimated to be above 400,000.\n\nAs of 2001, Orthodox Jews and Jews affiliated with an Orthodox synagogue accounted for approximately 50% of British Jews (150,000), 27% of Israeli Jews (1,500,000), and 13% of American Jews (529,000). Among those affiliated to a synagogue body, Orthodox Jews represent 70% of British Jewry, and 27% of American Jewry.\n\nIn 1880, the number of members of the American Jewry was 250,000. Their numbers swelled with European Jewish migration in the closing decades of the 19th century and opening decades of the 20th century to 3.5 million by 1924. This migration was discouraged by several Rabbis, stating that the American environment was not conducive to Jewish observance, an observation many Jews agreed with, but only after settling in the United States.\n\nAlthough sizable Orthodox Jewish communities are located throughout the United States, the highest number of American Orthodox Jews live in New York State, particularly in the New York City Metropolitan Area. Two of the main Orthodox communities in the United States are located in New York City and Rockland County. In New York City, the neighborhoods of Borough Park, Midwood, Williamsburg, and Crown Heights, located in the borough of Brooklyn, have particularly large Orthodox communities. The most rapidly growing community of American Orthodox Jews is located in Rockland County and the Hudson Valley of New York, including the communities of Monsey, Monroe, New Square, Kiryas Joel, and Ramapo. There are also sizable and rapidly growing Orthodox communities throughout New Jersey, particularly in Lakewood, Jackson Township, Freehold, Manalapan, Teaneck, Englewood, Passaic, and Fair Lawn. Growth in the Orthodox Jewish population in Lakewood has driven overall population growth, making it the fastest growing town by absolute numerical increase in New Jersey between roughly 2008 and 2012; Lakewood's population grew from 70,046 to 96,575, an increase of 26,529 over that period.\n\nIn addition, Maryland has a large number of Orthodox Jews, many of whom live in Baltimore, particularly in the Park Heights, Mount Washington, and Pikesville areas. Two other large Orthodox Jewish centers are southern Florida, particularly Miami Beach, and the Los Angeles area of California.\n\nIn contrast to the liberal American Jewish community, which is dwindling due to low fertility and high intermarriage and assimilation rates, the Orthodox Jewish community of the United States is growing rapidly. Among Orthodox Jews, the fertility rate stands at about 4.1 children per family, as compared to 1.9 children per family among non-Orthodox Jews, and intermarriage among Orthodox Jews is practically non-existent, standing at about 2%, in contrast to a 71% intermarriage rate among non-Orthodox Jews. In addition, Orthodox Judaism has a growing retention rate; while about half of those raised in Orthodox homes previously abandoned Orthodox Judaism, that number is declining. According to \"The New York Times\", the high growth rate of Orthodox Jews will eventually render them the dominant demographic force in New York - and American - Jewry.\n\nOn the other hand, Orthodox Jews subscribing to Modern Orthodoxy in its American and UK incarnations, tend to follow far more right-wing politics than both non-Orthodox and other Orthodox Jews. While the majority of non-Orthodox American Jews are on average strongly liberal and supporters of the Democratic Party, the Modern Orthodox subgroup of Orthodox Judaism tends to be far more conservative, with roughly half describing themselves as political conservatives, and are mostly Republican Party supporters. Modern Orthodox Jews, compared to both the non-Orthodox American Jewry and the Haredi and Hasidic Jewry, also tend to have a stronger connection to Israel due to their attachment to Zionism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24773690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24773690", "title": "Pei Plan", "text": "Pei Plan\n\nThe Pei Plan was an urban redevelopment initiative designed for downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, in the 1960s and 1970s. It is the informal name for two related commissions of noted architect and urban planner I. M. Pei – namely the Central Business District General Neighborhood Renewal Plan (design completed 1964) and the Central Business District Project I-A Development Plan (design completed 1966). It was formally adopted in 1965, and implemented in public and private phases throughout the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe plan called for the demolition of hundreds of antiquated downtown structures in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the Myriad Convention Center and the Myriad Botanical Gardens. It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s, supported by Oklahoma City Mayor Patience Latting. The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development. Public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures. As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS) initiative in 1993.\n\nSimilar to most urban areas in the post-World War II era, Oklahoma City experienced urban sprawl into outlying municipal and suburban areas in the 1940s and 1950s. At the same time, increased automobile traffic exhausted the limited parking availability in the Oklahoma City downtown area, a phenomenon which was exacerbated by the dismantling of the Oklahoma City Railway after World War II. In addition, real estate lots downtown – a holdover from the days of the Land Run of 1889 that settled the area – were too small to accommodate expanding business sizes. By 1962, 53 downtown retailers had closed or moved to the suburbs.\n\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s local Oklahoma City business leaders, including Dean A. McGee, Chamber of Commerce president Stanley Draper, and publisher E.K. Gaylord laid the groundwork for local and state laws authorizing land acquisitions for urban renewal. By 1962, the city council had authorized the creation of an Urban Renewal Authority, which received initial funding from local business leaders that hired architect I.M. Pei to design a comprehensive redevelopment proposal.\n\nAt the time, I.M. Pei had received international recognition for urban redesign plans for Cleveland, Ohio and Philadelphia, among others.\n\nI.M. Pei developed his plan for the Central Business District through 1964, initially disclosing it only to Urban Renewal Authority principals and principals of the related but privately financed Urban Action Foundation. Pei's plan called for the demolition of hundreds of buildings to form \"superblocks\" that could house large-scale development. Included in the plan were new parking garages (increasing available spaces from the then-available 14,300 to 28,360), a new street grid converting Robinson, Reno, and Sheridan (formerly Grand) Avenue into one-way streets, a new convention center, planned spaces for adjoining hotel development, a major retail center, new residential and office towers, an Tivoli-style outdoor garden, and an arts district centered around a new \"Mummer's Theater.\"\n\nBy the time the plan was ready for official city adoption, Oklahoma City Mayor Jack Wilkes had resigned to become President of Centenary College in Shreveport, Louisiana. City Council members chose for his replacement local civic leader and historian George H. Shirk, also a noted historic preservationist. Despite his preservationist tendencies, Shirk proved to be an enthusiastic supporter of the Pei Plan, and eventually cast the deciding vote in the city council to approve the plan in 1965.\n\nImplementation of the Pei Plan required a series of land acquisitions while replacement facilities and buildings were being built, and eventually grew to differ from Pei's original concept as landowners willingly sold properties to the Urban Renewal Authority, while other landowners targeted in the plan vigorously defended against eminent domain actions. Pei's original plan had called for the retention of, among other notable Oklahoma City landmarks, the Biltmore and Huckins Hotels.\n\nThe original plan also envisioned replacement facilities for downtown's John A. Brown Department Store, and the replacement of buildings along Main Street with an interior shopping arcade. Pei's plan had not finalized a site for the proposed convention center, which after negotiations between competing areas of the city was eventually located in an area of southeast downtown generally regarded as \"skid row,\" with funding ensured by a July 1968 special election.\n\nLarge-scale demolition began in 1967, funded with federal redevelopment grants provided under the Johnson administration. By the early 1970s the redevelopment authority had constructed the new convention center, expanded and rerouted Broadway Avenue (now renamed E.K. Gaylord Avenue) in Oklahoma City as a six-lane commuter thoroughfare featuring the vast Santa Fe Parking Garage, and provided sites for new headquarters of the Kerr-McGee Corporation (now home to SandRidge Energy), Liberty Bank (now the Chase Tower), and Fidelity Bank (now the Park Harvey Center). A pedestrian tunnel project originally designed to connect with the proposed Main Street shopping arcade was also constructed.\n\nUnder the Nixon administration, however, generous support of urban renewal effort began to dwindle. Hotel and retail developments originally envisioned as part of the Pei Plan began to disintegrate as retailers opted for shopping mall developments rather than downtown locations (the principal shopping malls in Oklahoma City included Penn Square Mall, Shepherd Mall, Crossroads Mall, and later, Quail Springs Mall). In particular, department store company John A. Brown (which originally featured Oklahoma City-based ownership, but subsequently merged with the Dayton Hudson Corporation in 1971) announced plans to abandon its downtown location on January 30, 1974. The proposed site for the Main Street arcade – which was to have connected to both the underground pedestrian tunnel and the Myriad Gardens – already largely demolished, was minimally redeveloped into a surface-level parking garage owned by public authorities.\n\nWith a dearth of retail opportunities downtown, residential developments envisioned in the Pei Plan failed to develop. Later phases of reconstruction centered on public works projects rather than private redevelopment. In 1977 the last major demolition was accomplished to make way for the Myriad Botanical Gardens west of the convention center. That year also saw the construction of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building – later the target of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh. By 1980, little if any redevelopment activity remained.\n\nPublic reaction to the Pei Plan became more negative over time as the redevelopment plans failed to create viable retail or residential options, and community activists bemoaned the loss of historical buildings. A preservationist group in Oklahoma City named the \"Criterion Group\" was named after the Criterion Theater – one of the most significant historical casualties of the Pei Plan – a French-style stage theater torn down in 1973 to make way for the Century Center (an enclosed shopping center which was largely vacant until 2015 when The Oklahoman opened offices in the space). Other casualties included the Baum Building (a Venetian-inspired structure that George Shirk attempted to save), the Hales Building (the owners of which fought condemnation efforts for nearly a decade), and the Biltmore Hotel, razed in 1977 to make way for the Myriad Botanical Gardens project. The delayed but negative reaction to the Pei Plan frustrated efforts by Oklahoma City authorities to instigate other urban renewal plans until the 1993 passage of the Metropolitan Area Projects (MAPS) initiative.\n\nThe Oklahoma City/County Historical Society retains a large-scale conceptual architecture model of the early Pei Plan, housed in the northeast corner of the Cox Convention Center with future plans to house the model at the downtown location of the Metropolitan Library System. In conjunction with several other organizations, the society sponsors an online archive of the Pei Plan and related downtown history.\n\n"}

{"id": "22509283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22509283", "title": "Stencil House", "text": "Stencil House\n\nStencil House, built in 1804 on one hundred-acre farm in Columbus, New York, was modeled after a Capen house, a small, side-gabled structure prevalent throughout the colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries. Named after Parson Joseph Capen of Topsfield, Massachusetts, who built one of the earliest such structures in 1692, Capen houses reflect the British influence on early Puritan architecture. The house is now an 18th-century period historic house museum located at the Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont.\n\nBuilt around a large central fireplace that opened on multiple sides to maximize warmth, Capen houses, like their medieval English counterparts, typically possessed three or four rooms on the ground floor: a parlor, a “hall,” a kitchen, and sometimes a foyer. The parlor traditionally functioned as a formal space and was not heated in the winter except on special occasions. The kitchen and hall acted as communal living spaces. The stairwell, not yet considered a focal point of design, remained a discreet and functional element of the house’s plan. While American colonists maintained the basic floor plan of the European houses, the ready and cheap supply of timber allowed them to use clapboard siding and shingled roofs rather than the mud and thatch common in Britain.\n\nAlthough Stencil House was constructed along this basic plan, the interior reflects a 19th-century decorum rather than the Puritan simplicity of earlier Capen Houses. The parlor maintains its position as a reception room and while the “hall” has become a formal dining room. Only the kitchen, at the rear of the structure, maintains its original use as a communal family area.\n\nThe extensive stenciling in the foyer, parlor, and dining room augment these formal embellishments. When the Museum acquired the building in 1953, wallpaper obscured the extensive stenciling. Before moving the house to the Museum, workers removed several layers of peeling paper, revealing the scope of the painted decoration beneath. Rather than confining motifs to borders, the Stencil House artist had covered entire walls, working directly on boards rather than on plaster walls. This work was probably completed sometime between 1810 and 1830. Many of the stenciled designs in this house are identical to those found on the walls of the Farmersville Tavern, Farmersville, New York.\n\nNineteenth-century American homeowners employed many methods in ornamenting their interiors. Rich paint colors and wallpaper were widely available in America as early as 1725 and by 1830 thousands of trade painters offered wallpapering, mural painting, and stenciling among their marketable talents. Shelburne Museum’s collection includes examples of all three types of wall treatments. \n\nMembers of the upper class often imported French and English wallpaper to adorn formal rooms such as parlors, ballrooms, and dining rooms. These papers frequently represented scenic landscapes and possessed bright colors and bold patterning that could stand out even in weak candlelight. \n\nMural painting offered an equally decorative but less expensive mode of adornment for those who could not afford to import expensive papers. Jonathan Poor, and his partner, Paine, worked as limners. Traveling around Maine, they offered their services as decorative painters charging $10 for a completed room. Represented in the Museum’s collection is an ornamental over-mantel and chimney-surround that Poor and Paine created in about 1830. Designed as part of a painted chamber of landscape murals, these paintings, with their views of busy harbors, farms, and forests, are outstanding examples of a decorative technique that is frequently lost to demolition.\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, itinerant artists would stencil walls in exchange for room and board. These artists would cut patterns from thin wood or heavy paper and use them to decorate walls and furniture. Stencil House’s parlor, dining room, and entrance hall exhibit a variety of stenciled patterns, including a grape leaf border, vases of flowers, and patriotic eagles, while Dutton House’s rooms and hallways reflect their original stenciled patterns.\n\n"}

It has been published by Waitrose since August 2013. It was previously published by Which?books.\n\nThe \"Good Food Guide\" was first published in 1951 by Raymond Postgate, an enthusiastic gourmand, who was appalled by the standard of contemporary catering. He recruited an army of volunteers to clandestinely visit and assess restaurants on the basis that, \"You can corrupt one man. You can't bribe an army.\" Postgate had previously founded the Good Food Club in 1949. The \"Good Food Guide\" currently reports on over 1,200 top establishments and is unique as it is completely rewritten every year and is entirely independent — there is no advertising or sponsorship, no fees are accepted for inclusion, and all of the inspections are anonymous.\n\nReaders are actively encouraged to submit their reviews, via the Good Food Guide website, which are then considered for prospective inclusion in next year's guide. The best contributors are put forward to become future restaurant inspectors for The \"Good Food Guide\". Restaurants are scored out of ten.\n\nAn early contributor to the Guide, Margaret Costa later opened her own restaurant, Lacy's, in Mayfair. The Guide received so many reviews for Lacy's that the entry for the restaurant was divided into \"Love Lacy's\" and \"Loathe Lacy's\" columns.\n\nIn 2007 former Good Food Guide inspectors and editors criticised the Guide after a series of high-profile restaurant omissions, claiming that a new inspection and editorial regime had led to corners being cut after incorporating three hundred reader-recommended restaurants within its twelve hundred full entries.\n\nFormer inspector and editor, Jim Ainsworth, described the new regime as \"penny-pinching\" and said of the 2008 guide: \"The word that occurs to me is careless. A lot of things simply appear to have been done in a rush.\" Among the omissions, a restaurant was omitted in the Scilly Isles despite being listed as a main entry on the guide's map of the island. Some restaurants were omitted after a lack of reader reviews.\n\nThe publishers of the Guide, Which?, strongly denied the allegations, conceding that some former inspectors had been \"disgruntled\" at the changes, but stressed that most of the inspection team was unchanged and there had been no reduction in standards.\n\n2008 saw the publication of special London edition of the Guide. This followed Michelin who had published a dedicated London guide the previous year.\n\nIn the 2013 edition of the \"Guide\", Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck and Simon Rogan's L'Enclume shared a perfect score of ten. A branch of Little Chef near Popham was included in the 2010 guide after a makeover by Heston Blumenthal as part of a Channel 4 programme.\n\nIn August 2013, the guide was purchased and is now published by Waitrose.\n\nEvery year the \"Guide\" presents its Editor's Awards in the following categories; Best New Entry: Restaurant, Best New Entry: Pub, Wine List of the Year, Chef of the Year, Chef to Watch, Pub of the year, Local Gem of the Year and Best Set Lunch.\n\nTo celebrate the Guide's sixtieth anniversary in 2010, the Guide presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to chef Raymond Blanc of Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons in Great Milton, a restaurant that has spent 27 years in the guide. The award was presented in recognition of his \"unerring commitment to consistency, quality and seasonal produce\"\n\n\n"}

Andrew Lang included a variant in \"The Yellow Fairy Book\". It is Aarne–Thompson type 451: the brothers who were turned into birds. Other tales of this type include The Magic Swan Geese, The Seven Ravens, The Twelve Wild Ducks, Udea and her Seven Brothers, The Wild Swans, and The Twelve Brothers.\n\nA King gets lost in a forest, and an old woman helps him, on the condition that he marry her beautiful daughter. The King has a bad feeling about this but accepts anyway. He has six sons and a daughter from his first marriage, however, and fears that the children will be targeted by his new wife; so he sends them away and visits them in secret. \n\nThe new queen and now stepmother, who has learned witchcraft from her mother, finds out about her stepchildren and decides to get them out of her way. She sews six magical shirts and goes to the hidden castle where the children are hidden for safety, then tosses the shirts over the boys and transforms them into swans. \n\nThe brothers can only take their human forms for fifteen minutes every evening. They tell their still human younger sister that they've heard of a way to break such curses: she must make six shirts out of nettles and can't make a sound for six years or the spell will never be broken. The girl agrees to do this and runs away, hiding in a hunter's hut and dedicating herself solely to gathering the nettles and sewing in silence.\n\nYears later, the King of another country finds the girl doing this, is taken by her beauty, and takes her into the court with the intention of making her his queen. However, the King's snobbish mother hates her and does not consider her fit to be a Queen. When she gives birth to their first child, the wicked mother-in-law takes away the child and accuses the queen of killing and eating him, but the King refuses to believe it. \n\nThe young Queen gives birth to two other children, but twice again the mother-in-law hides them away and falsely claims that she has killed and eaten her babies. The King is unable to keep protecting her, and unable to properly defend herself, the queen is sentenced to be burned at the stake as a witch. All this time, she has held back her tears and her words, sewing and sewing the nettle shirts no matter what.\n\nOn the day of her execution, the Queen has all but finished making the shirts for her brothers. Only the last shirt misses a left arm. When she is brought to the stake she takes the shirts with her and when she is about to be burned, the seven years expire and the six swans come flying through the air. She throws the shirts over her brothers and they regain their human form, though the youngest prince's left arm remains a wing due to the missing sleeve. \n\nThe queen is now free to speak, and she can defend herself against the accusations. She does so with the support of her brothers. In the end, the evil mother-in-law is the one who is burned at the stake as punishment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30334", "title": "Thesaurus", "text": "Thesaurus\n\nIn general usage, a thesaurus is a reference work that lists words grouped together according to similarity of meaning (containing synonyms and sometimes antonyms), in contrast to a dictionary, which provides definitions for words, and generally lists them in alphabetical order. The main purpose of such reference works for users \"to find the word, or words, by which [an] idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed\" – to quote Peter Mark Roget, architect of the best known thesaurus in the English language.\n\nAlthough including synonyms, a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word. The entries are also designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word. Unlike a dictionary, a thesaurus entry does not give the definition of words.\n\nIn library science and information science, thesauri have been widely used to specify domain models. Recently, thesauri have been implemented with Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS).\n\nThe word \"thesaurus\" is derived from 16th-century New Latin, in turn from Latin \"thēsaurus\", which is the Latinisation of the Greek (\"thēsauros\"), \"treasure, treasury, storehouse\". The word \"thēsauros\" is of uncertain etymology. Douglas Harper derives it from the root of the Greek verb τιθέναι \"tithenai\", \"to put, to place.\" Robert Beekes rejected an Indo-European derivation and suggested a Pre-Greek suffix .\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th centuries, the term \"thesaurus\" was applied to any dictionary or encyclopedia, as in the \"Thesaurus linguae latinae\" (1532), and the \"Thesaurus linguae graecae\" (1572). The meaning \"collection of words arranged according to sense\" is first attested in 1852 in Roget's title and \"thesaurer\" is attested in Middle English for \"treasurer\".\n\nIn antiquity, Philo of Byblos authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus. In Sanskrit, the Amarakosha is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century. The Amarakosha mentions 18 prior works, but they have all been lost.\n\nThe first modern thesaurus was \"Roget's Thesaurus\", first compiled in 1805 by Peter Mark Roget, and published in 1852. Since its publication it has never been out of print and is still a widely used work across the English-speaking world. Entries in \"Roget's Thesaurus\" are listed conceptually rather than alphabetically.\nRoget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:\n\nIt is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.\nThesauri have been used to perform automatic word-sense disambiguation and text simplification for machine translation systems.\n\n"}

From 1825 to 1827 he was the founding professor of Pure mathematics in the University of Virginia, and after his return to England was appointed (1828) professor of Latin in the newly founded University of London.\n\nIn 1832 he became joint headmaster of the school founded in connection with that institution (the University College School); in 1842 he resigned the professorship of Latin, and took up that of comparative grammar, together with the undivided headmastership of the school. These two posts he held until his death. A few years before his death, he also took the position of secretary to the College of Preceptors in London (later known as the College of Teachers).\n\nKey is best known for his introduction of the crude-form (the uninflected form or stem of words) system, in general use among Sanskrit grammarians, into the teaching of the classical languages. This system was embodied in his \"Latin Grammar\" (1846). In \"Language, its Origin and Development\" (1874), he upheld the onomatopoeic theory.\n\nKey was prejudiced against the German Sanskritists, and the etymological portion of his \"Latin Dictionary\", published in 1888, was severely criticized on this account. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and president of the Philological Society, to the \"Transactions\" of which he contributed largely.\n\nKey was the great-grandfather of British authors Rumer Godden and Jon Godden.\n\n\n"}

Franklin used the first edition of his almanac to predict Leeds's death (Oct. 17, 1733, 3:29 P.M., at the very instant of the conjunction of the Sun and Mercury), and encouraged his readers to buy next year's edition of \"Poor Richard's Almanac\" to see if Franklin was right. When the date of Leeds' supposed passing had come and gone, Franklin published Leeds' obituary anyway. When challenged by the very much alive Leeds, Franklin insisted that Leeds had in fact died, but that he was being impersonated by an inferior publisher.

It is dedicated to the study of archaeology, art history, anthropology and epigraphy.\n\nAdmission is based on a competitive entrance exam after high school (lycée), though candidates may also apply after two or three years of university studies in the subjects of history, classics, literature, geography, philosophy and art. The school offers an undergraduate program, a master's program and a doctoral program as well as a preparation class for civil service entrance exams.\n\nThe École du Louvre was created in 1882 with the mission to \"extract from the collections the knowledge they contain, and to train curators, missionaries and excavators\". The school was originally dedicated to archaeology, but soon expanded to related disciplines, such as history of art, anthropology and ancient languages.\n\nThe school was created in a context of expansion of higher education in Europe, and in France in particular, which was reflected by providing lectures to the general public in addition to providing an education to students. Public lectures and conferences aimed at fee-paying \"auditors\", and summer school, continues the tradition on which the school was based. \n\nOther prestigious institutions were created during the same period in France, such as the Institut d'études politiques de Paris (Sciences-Po) or the École des Hautes Études Commerciales (HEC).\n\nIn 1920, the school established the General Art History course (known as \"HGA\"), that became the foundation for the curriculum. This course would develop into the current graduate program over the following years.\n\nIn 1927, the school was innovative by creating the chair of museology, the first such in the world.\n\nIn 1998, following the development of the \"Grand Louvre\", the school moved to its present location in the Aile de Flore, the river-facing wing of the museum.\n\nThe École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts or the Ecole Boulle are also well known art institutions in France.\n\nAs of 2006, the École du Louvre complies with the Bologna process and offers an undergraduate degree after three years (\"Premier Cycle\"), a master's degree after two years (\"Deuxième cycle\") and a research degree in three years (\"Troisième Cycle\"). It also provides preparation classes for some civil service exams as well as conferences for a wider public. Altogether, there are about 700 teaching staff.\n\nUndergraduate students follow a core course called \"HGA\" (General Art History studying various periods and areas). Lectures are held in an amphitheatre, and tutorials are held in various museums providing a \"hands-on\" experience with the material.\n\nThe first year is dedicated to the Antiquity, with an emphasis on Prehistoric, Classical and Oriental Archaeology.\n\nThe second year focuses on the History of Art and Archaeology of the non-Western world, as well as the study of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.\n\nThe final year focuses on the History of Art in modern times, and African and Oceana Art including Anthropology.\n\nIn addition to the core course, in their first year students choose a specialisation area to study for the duration of the degree, known as \"cours organiques\" or \"spé\". Currently 31 specialisations (or \"cours organiques\") exist such as painting, drawing, sculpture, engraving, furniture, architecture, industrial design, cinema, fashion, photography created in various areas all over the world such as in Europe, Africa, America, Oceania or Middle and Far East. Students also take courses in Epigraphy, Numismatics or Modern Languages.\n\nThe master's program is composed of two years. During the first year, students study museology and research methods. At the end of the second year, students submit a master's thesis highlighting research and work experience.\n\nAlthough the research program is not formally a doctoral program, delivering a \"diplôme de recherche approfondie\" instead, students spend the three or more years conducting extensive academic research under the direction of a supervisor from the École du Louvre.\n\nThe École du Louvre has exchange agreements with the Université de Montréal in Quebec, the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti in Venice, Italy and the University of Heidelberg in Germany. In October 2014, a new dual degree Master's program between the Ecole du Louvre and Sciences Po was announced.\n\nThe École du Louvre possesses one of the largest Art History and Archeology collections, which is made available to academics and students.\n\nThe École du Louvre regularly publishes books, manuals and academic research, often in conjunction with an external publishing house.\n\n"}
