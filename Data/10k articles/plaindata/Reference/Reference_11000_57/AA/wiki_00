{"id": "54385959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54385959", "title": "Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics", "text": "Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics\n\n\"Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics\" was the title of a letter to the editor published by Jane Porter and Hershel Jick in the January 10, 1980, issue of \"The New England Journal of Medicine\". The letter analyzed data on patients who had been treated with opioids in a hospital setting, and concluded that addiction was uncommon among such patients. It has since been frequently misrepresented to claim that opioids are not addictive when prescribed for use at home, which has been blamed for contributing to the opioid epidemic in the United States.\nThe letter reported on an examination of medical files of patients who had been hospitalized at Boston University Medical Center and subsequently treated with small doses of opioids. The authors concluded that of the 11,882 patients who received at least one narcotic drug, only four of them had developed a \"reasonably well documented\" addiction among patients who had no history of addiction. Its text read, in its entirety: \n\nThe article was subsequently cited extensively as evidence that addiction was very rare among patients who were prescribed narcotics (more specifically, opioids). It became so well known that it is sometimes referred to simply as Porter and Jick. \n\nMethodological limitations from which the letter suffered included that the patients it reported on were all given opioids in small doses in a hospital, and were not given the opportunity to use them at home. Additionally, in 2003, Jick told \"The New York Times\" that the study did not follow patients after they left the hospital.\n\nIn 2017, the letter attracted renewed interest because the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" published a bibliographic analysis of the letter showing that it had been cited 608 times since it was published. In comparison, the other letters to the editor in the same issue of the \"Journal\" as Porter and Jick's letter had been cited a median of 11 times. Of these 608 citations, the analysis also showed that 72.2% of them cited it in support of the claim that patients treated with opioids rarely developed addiction, and 80.8% did not mention that the letter only included data on prescriptions given to hospitalized patients. It was also misrepresented in the popular media; a 1990 \"Scientific American\" article described it as an \"extensive study,\" and a 2001 \"Time\" story dubbed it a \"landmark study\" showing that concerns about opioid addiction were \"basically unwarranted.\" In addition, Purdue Pharma, the manufacturer of OxyContin, trained its sales representatives to say that the risk of addiction among patients using the drug was less than 1 percent, citing Porter and Jick's letter as one of their sources.\n\nBecause the letter has been frequently misrepresented to argue that opioids were rarely addictive, these misrepresentations have been blamed for contributing to the opioid epidemic. For example, the lead author of the 2017 bibliographic analysis, David Juurlink, has stated that he thinks the letter's appearance in a prestigious journal helped convince doctors that opioids were safe, saying, \"I think it's fair to say that this letter went quite a long way.\" Jick, who wrote the letter, has since said that \"The letter wasn't of value to health and medicine in and of itself. So if I could take it back—if I knew then what I know now, I would never have published it. It wasn't worth it.\"\n\n"}

It was made by the Brygos potter and painted by the man known as the Brygos Painter. It depicts some of the best-known images of ancient pottery.\nApart from a fracture on the base of the cup, the kylix remains intact. It is a kylix, a particularly successful example of \"Type B\" of the more than a hundred forms of Attic pottery cups. The contours of the vessel are perfectly worked from lip to foot. On the untreated clay inside of the left handle, the potter Brygos has left his signature in dainty letters: ΒΡΥΓΟΣ ΕΠΟΙΕΣΕΝ (Brygos made this). In the scholarship it is controversial as to whether it was personally produced by the Brygos painter and the Brygos potter. The painter was identified with the notname \"Brygos Painter\" by John Beazley, who also argued that the potter of the Würzburg cup was one of very great ability. The cup is 14 centimetres high and has a diameter of 32.2 centimetres. It once belonged to the Feoli collection, but today is in the Martin von Wagner Museum in Würzburg, where it has the inventory number HA 248 (= L 479).\n\nThe image in the bowl (Tondo) shows a young participant at a symposion who is throwing up as a result of overindulgence. A blonde woman helpfully and carefully holds his head. Because only prostitutes were generally present at such parties, she should also be a Hetaira. Both are depicted wearing garlands. The young man supports himself with his walking stick, which is the symbol of leisure. Probably he is a young aristocrat. The image is surrounded by a meander. \n\nThe exterior shows a procession of revelers (\"komos\"), the boisterous event which occurred at the end of a symposion. The komasts are largely naked, dressed in only a chlamys (cloak), and are crown with grape vines. The cloaks are depicted with the scattered dots which are typical of the Brygos painter. One of the revelers plays the aulos (a double flute), another plays the barbiton (a type of lyre). The participants in the procession head off with bouncy steps. A few details, such as their headbands and vine wreaths are painted in the same red as their skin. Above all, the tondo image and the barbiton player are images which were often reproduced in the literary tradition and other media.\n\n"}

A cast of real-life individuals are then introduced and are led by the filmmakers to discuss topics on the themes of French society and happiness in the working class. At the end of the movie, the filmmakers show their subjects the compiled footage and have the subjects discuss the level of reality that they thought the movie obtained.\n\nThis feature was filmed in Paris and Saint-Tropez, France. Synchronized sound was used by Rouch using a 16 mm camera connected through pilottone with a prototype of Nagra III, a transistorized tape recorder with electronic speed control, developed by Stefan Kudelski.\n\nIt is also widely regarded as an experimental and structurally innovative film and an example of \"cinéma vérité\" and direct cinema. The term \"cinema verite\" was suggested by the film's publicist and coined by Rouch, highlighting a connection between film and its context, a fact Brault confirmed in an interview after a screening of \"Chronique d'un été\" at the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto in 2011.\n\nIn a 2014 \"Sight and Sound\" poll, film critics voted \"Chronicle of a Summer\" the sixth best documentary film of all time.\n\nAll cast members appear as themselves.\n\n"}
{"id": "40814303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40814303", "title": "Cihai", "text": "Cihai\n\nThe Cihai is a large-scale dictionary and encyclopedia of Standard Mandarin Chinese. The Zhonghua Book Company published the first \"Cihai\" edition in 1938, and the Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House revised editions in 1979, 1989, 1999, and 2009. A standard bibliography of Chinese reference works (Teng and Biggerstaff 1971:134) calls the \"Cihai\" an \"outstanding dictionary\".\n\nThe \"Cihai\" is a semi-encyclopedic dictionary and enters Chinese words from many fields of knowledge, such as history, science, mathematics, philosophy, medicine, and law.\n\nChinese lexicography dichotomizes two kinds of dictionaries: traditional \"zidian\" (, lit. \"character/logograph dictionary\") for written Chinese characters and modern \"cidian\" ( \"word/phrase dictionary\") for spoken expressions. For example, the \"Hanyu Da Zidian\" for characters and \"Hanyu Da Cidian\" for words. The \"Cihai\", as the title indicates, is a \"cidian\".\n\nThe American sinologist George A. Kennedy, who wrote a student's guide to using the \"Cihai\" as the basis for sinological studies, said the dictionary's principal values are its (1953:85) \"explanations for phrases and compound expressions\" and (1953:131) \"citations illustrating the use of words and expressions.\"\n\nThe \"Cihai\" originated when Lufei Kui, founder of the Zhonghua Book Company, decided to publish a comprehensive Chinese dictionary to compete with rival Commercial Press's 1915 \"Ciyuan\" (辭源 \"source of words\") (Wilkinson 2000:89). Under the editorship of Shu Xincheng (舒新城, 1893-1960), Shen Yi (沈颐）and others, over 100 lexicographers worked for two decades to compile the \"Cihai\", which was published in 1936. This 2-volume first edition has over 80,000 entries arranged under single characters in radical-stroke order, with the words and compounds under each character listed by the number of characters and strokes. The definitions are written in \"wenyan\" \"literary Chinese\" (Hartmann 2003:166). The Taiwan branch of Zhonghua published a \"Cihai\" reprint in 1956 with minor revisions additions and corrections (Yang 1985:279).\n\nPlans for a second edition began after a 1958 conference about revising the \"Cihai\" and \"Ciyuan\". The \"Cihai\" Editorial Committee organized over 5000 scholars and specialists to undertake the new compilation, concentrating on revising the first edition entries and adding modern terminology, especially scientific and technical terminology. Reinhard Hartmann (2003:166) describes the editorial work of revising \"Cihai\" as taking \"a tortuous course, 22 years from start to finish\". After the original editor-in-chief Shu Xincheng died in 1960, he was succeeded by Chen Wangdao, who died in 1977, and was succeeded by Xia Zhengnong (夏征农, 1904-2008). From 1961 to 1962, sixteen \"shiyong\" (試用 \"trial\") individual subject-matter fascicles were distributed for comments by specialists, and in 1965 a \"weidinggao\" (未定稿 \"draft manuscript\") \"Cihai\" was completed, but the anti-intellectualism of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) halted editorial work (Huang et al. 1993:220). Shanghai Dictionary Publishing House (上海辭書出版社) published the three-volume revised edition \"Cihai\" in 1979 and a condensed single-volume version in 1980.\n\nThe revised 1979 edition has the same title and layout as the original 1936 edition, but serves a much different purpose (Wilkinson 2000:89). The first edition covers China's past and uses literary Chinese for definitions, while the second edition also covers modern China and international matters and uses \"baihua\" \"colloquial speech\". It contains 106,578 entries, totaling more than 13.4 million characters. The single character headwords are arranged under 250 radicals, with subsequent words listed according to stroke numbers. The third volume appends useful charts (e.g., a chronology of Chinese history), tables (weights and measures), lists (Ethnic minorities in China), and a \"pinyin\" index to single characters.\n\nThe 1989 three-volume edition \"Cihai\" was also compiled with Xia Zhengnong as editor-in-chief. It focused upon the addition of 20th-century terms, more proper names, and technical vocabulary. This third edition \"Cihai\" contains 16,534 head characters, with more than 120,000 entries, totaling over 15.8 million characters. (Huang et al. 1993:223-224)\nThe 1999 \"Cihai\" contains 17,674 head characters, 122,835 entries, totaling more than 19.8 million characters. This fourth edition dictionary added many color tables and illustrations. Arrangement is by radicals and there are stroke-count, four-corner, \"pinyin\", and foreign-language indexes (Wilkinson 2000:89). It was also published in a compact version.\n\n\"Cihai\" was consulted in the writing of \"The First Series of Standardized Forms of Words with Non-standardized Variant Forms\".\n\nThe 2009 fifth edition \"Cihai\" contains more than 127,200 entries, arranged by \"pinyin\", with over 22 million characters total. Chen Zhili replaced Xia Zhengnong as chief editor, and lexicographers deleted about 7,000 entries for outdated terms and added almost 10,000 for neologisms. Volumes 1-4 contain text, with many color illustrations, and Volume 5 contains indexes.\n\nThe \"Dacihai\" (大辞海 \"Great sea of words\") is a 38-volume encyclopedia project that began in 2004, and published the first volumes in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCihai edition dictionaries are specialized dictionaries for languages.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Tung Hua Book Co., Ltd. had published Cihai from Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House, Chung Hwa Book Company, Limited requested Tung Hua Book not to use 'Cihai' as book title to avoid trademark violation. The Taiwan-based Chung Hwa Book Company, Limited already registered 'Cihai' as trademark for printed material in 1985 prior to THB's publication, but the book's content was licensed from Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House, whom had authorized the use of contents to THB.\n\n\n"}

Co-written with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, it was published in 2002 by W.W. Norton & Company.\n\nHill describes the writing process with Child as collaborative: \"He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was.\" Hill explained in an interview that writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to \"convey the history and culture of free climbing\", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: \"And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point, because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there.\" Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.\n\nOne review of the book described it as \"more diary than memoir\" and praises Hill's storytelling when recounting her adventurous climbs but contends that it ultimately fails due to a lack of editing. Too much personal detail about family and boyfriends is included. \"Publishers Weekly\" and \"Library Journal\", on the other hand, found it entertaining and wrote glowingly of Hill's ability to narrate a good story.\n"}

The Botanical Gardens were transferred to the Console site (192 rue de Lausanne) in 1904, constructed by the Genevan architect Henri Juvet in 1902–1904 specifically to house the Delessert herbarium held at Bastions. The collection grew in 1911–1912 with the gift of the Emile Burant herbarium, then again in 1923–1924 with the posthumous donation of the de Candolle herbarium. In its present location, it occupies an area of adjacent to Lake Geneva and the park of the United Nations Office at Geneva and ranks as one of the five most important in the world. The gardens themselves were designed by . The Botanical Garden's greenhouses initially remained at the Bastions site for financial reasons. Then, in 1910–1911, the architect Henri Juvet built a Winter Garden along the former Chemin de Varembe, which was moved to its present location close to the railway lines following the construction of the Palais des Nations and the various associated urban redevelopments that took place. The elegant glass and iron structure is in line with constructions of this type in fashion in the second half of the 19th century. It originally comprised two adjacent but separate sections: the Winter Garden and a greenhouse, creating an asymmetrical effect. A symmetrical wing was added to the first in 1935. The greenhouses at Bastions were removed to make way for the Wall of the Reformers.\n\nThe botanical garden includes a living collection of 14,000 species of 249 different families from around the world, and a historical herbarium of nearly 6 million botanical specimens. The library of over 220,000 volumes\n\nThe living collection is divided into several sections: an arboretum, rock gardens and banks of protected plants, medicinal and useful plants, greenhouses, horticultural plants (including a \"garden of scent and touch\"). The garden also incorporates a zoo dedicated to conservation and the \"Botanicum\" (a family space) near the lake.\n\nThe entire garden, including greenhouses, libraries and collections, and two mansions \"Le Chene\" and \"La Console\", is registered as a cultural asset of national importance.\n\nThe institution has a special interest in the medicinal plants of Paraguay, with about 5000 known plants thanks to the legacy of the Guaraní people, preserved by the Jesuit missions and the collections of Emil Hassler. The Paraguayan Ethnobotany Project was established in the mid 1990s in collaboration with the Botanical Garden and Zoo of Asunción. This collaborative framework has facilitated the creation of a large herbarium of Paraguayan medicinal plants and the creation of the \"\" (Center for Conservation and Environmental Education: CCEAM), located within the Botanical Garden of Asunción.\n\nFrom 1 January 2015, under leadership of head gardener Nicolas Freyre and Director Pierre-André Loizeau, the Conservatory and Botanical Gardens became 100% organic, the first public garden in Switzerland to formally meet the standards of Bio Suisse. Although previously almost entirely organic, a bachelor student from the Haute École du paysage, d'ingénierie et d'architecture de Genève validated the requirements.

The film is directed by David Leitch from a script by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Ryan Reynolds, with Reynolds starring in the title role alongside Josh Brolin, Morena Baccarin, Julian Dennison, Zazie Beetz, T.J. Miller, Brianna Hildebrand, and Jack Kesy. In the film, Deadpool forms the team X-Force to protect a young mutant from the time-traveling soldier Cable.\n\nPlans for a sequel to \"Deadpool\" began before that film's release, and were confirmed in February 2016. Though the original creative team of Reynolds, Reese, Wernick, and director Tim Miller were quickly set to return for the second film, Miller left the project in October 2016 due to creative differences with Reynolds and was soon replaced by Leitch. An extensive casting search took place to fill the role of Cable, with Brolin ultimately cast. Filming took place in British Columbia, Canada, from June to October 2017.

It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its humor, acting (particularly Reynolds, Brolin, and Beetz's performances), story, and action sequences, with some calling it better than the first film, although a feeling of cynicism drew some criticism. An extended edition was released in August 2018, and a re-cut, PG-13 version of the film titled \"Once Upon a Deadpool\" will be released theatrically in December 2018. A sequel, \"Deadpool 3\", is in development.\n\nAfter successfully working as the mercenary Deadpool for two years, Wade Wilson fails to kill one of his targets on his anniversary with Vanessa, his girlfriend. That night, after the pair decide to start a family together, the target tracks Wilson down and kills Vanessa. Wilson kills the man in revenge. He blames himself for her death and attempts to commit suicide six weeks later by blowing himself up. Wilson has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife, but the pieces of his body remain alive and are put back together by Colossus. Wilson is left with only a Skee-Ball token, an anniversary gift, as a final memento of Vanessa.\n\nRecovering at the X-Mansion, Wilson reluctantly agrees to join the X-Men as a form of healing. He, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant Russell Collins / Firefist at an orphanage, labeled a \"Mutant Reeducation Center\". Wilson realizes that Collins has been abused by the orphanage staff, and kills one of the staff members. Colossus stops him from killing anyone else, and both Wilson and Collins are arrested. Restrained with collars that suppress their powers, they are taken to the Ice Box, an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Meanwhile, Cable—a cybernetic soldier from the future whose family is murdered by an older Collins—travels back in time to kill Collins before he ever becomes a killer.\n\nCable breaks into the Ice Box and attacks Collins. Wilson, whose collar breaks in the ensuing melee, attempts to defend Collins. After Cable takes Vanessa's token, Wilson forces himself and Cable out of the prison, but not before Collins overhears Wilson deny that he cares for the young mutant. Near death again, Wilson has another vision of Vanessa in which she convinces him to help Collins. Wilson organizes a team called X-Force to break Collins out of a prison-transfer convoy and defend him from Cable. The team launches its assault on the convoy by parachute, but all of the members die during the landing except for Wilson and the lucky Domino. While they fight Cable, Collins frees fellow inmate Juggernaut, who agrees to help Collins kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the convoy, allowing himself and Collins to escape.\n\nCable offers to work with Wilson and Domino to stop Collins' first murder, and agrees to give Wilson a chance to talk Collins down. At the orphanage, they are overpowered by Juggernaut while Collins attacks the headmaster, until Colossus—who had at first refused to help Wilson due to Wilson's murderous ways—arrives to distract Juggernaut. When Wilson fails to talk down Collins, Cable shoots at the young mutant. Wilson leaps in front of the bullet while wearing the Ice Box collar and dies, reuniting with Vanessa in the afterlife. Seeing this sacrifice, Collins does not kill the headmaster; this changes the future so that Cable's family now survives. Cable uses the last charge on his time-traveling device, which he needed for returning to his family, to go back several minutes and strap Vanessa's token in front of Wilson's heart. Now when Wilson takes the bullet for Collins, it is stopped by the token and both survive while Collins still has his change of heart. Afterwards, the headmaster is run over by Wilson's taxi-driver friend Dopinder.\n\nIn a mid-credits sequence, Negasonic Teenage Warhead and her girlfriend Yukio repair Cable's time-traveling device for Wilson. He uses it to save the lives of Vanessa and X-Force member Peter, and kills both \"\"s version of Deadpool and actor Ryan Reynolds while he is considering starring in the film \"Green Lantern\".\n\n\nIn addition to portraying Deadpool and himself, Reynolds provided the voice for the Juggernaut. Juggernaut is credited as being voiced by \"himself\", and was previously portrayed by Vinnie Jones in the 2006 film \"\". According to Reese, the creative team on \"Deadpool 2\" felt that appearance did not do justice to the character. Wanting an additional villain for the film to support Firefist for the final fight with X-Force, the writers chose Juggernaut because he is \"a force of nature [who] was probably the coolest character never to be used ... in the right way\". The character's face was modeled on Leitch's, with Reynolds providing facial capture and his voice. The latter was digitally modulated to make it deeper. Reese added that the character \"didn't have many lines, he's a man of few words, but he's a man of great anger and forcefulness\".\n\nStefan Kapičić voices Colossus, an X-Man with the mutant ability to transform his entire body into organic steel. Kapičić described Colossus as one of the most important characters in the film, requiring a more intense process for Kapičić during recording for the character. He explained that Colossus would continue to try make Deadpool a better person and potential X-Man after doing so in the first film. Unlike the first film, Kapičić also provided performance capture for the character's face on the sequel, while Andre Tricoteux returned to stand-in for the character on set. Leslie Uggams and Karan Soni also return from the first film as Deadpool's elderly roommate Blind Al and the taxi driver Dopinder, respectively. Additionally, Eddie Marsan plays the headmaster of the Essex Home for Mutant Rehabilitation, an orphanage; Robert Maillet briefly appears as Sluggo, an inmate of the Ice Box who originally had a more prominent antagonistic role alongside Black Tom before both roles were reduced due to the number of villains in the film; Hayley Sales and Islie Hirvonen respectively appear as Cable's wife and Hope, their daughter, during a flashforward; and Shioli Kutsuna portrays Yukio, Negasonic Teenage Warhead's girlfriend and fellow X-Man. A version of Yukio previously appeared in the 2013 film \"The Wolverine\", portrayed by Rila Fukushima. The film's version of the X-Force team also includes Terry Crews as Bedlam, Lewis Tan as Shatterstar, Bill Skarsgård as Zeitgeist, Rob Delaney as Peter, and Brad Pitt as Vanisher. Pitt was considered for the role of Cable before scheduling issues prevented him from taking it; he filmed his Vanisher cameo in two hours during post-production.\n\nReprising their roles as the X-Men for a brief appearance are James McAvoy as Professor X, Nicholas Hoult as Beast, Evan Peters as Quicksilver, Tye Sheridan as Cyclops, Alexandra Shipp as Storm, and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nightcrawler. Archive footage of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine from \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" is used in the mid-credits sequence, with Jackman's permission. This was re-edited for the sequence, and included raw footage shot for that film. Luke Roessler, who portrays a young David Haller in the \"X-Men\"-based television series \"Legion\", appears as a young mutant credited as \"Cereal Kid\". When Cable travels to the present day, he comes across two \"rednecks\" discussing a toilet paper manifesto. This was inspired by a real manifesto written by Reese, which the writers wanted to be discussed in the film by a certain \"calibre\" of actor: the characters are portrayed by Alan Tudyk and a disguised Matt Damon, with the latter credited as \"Dickie Greenleaf\" (a reference to the 1999 film \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\" in which Damon stars). Leitch and writers Reese and Paul Wernick respectively cameo as Ice Box inmate \"Ground Chuck Mutant\", a news helicopter pilot, and a news cameraman. Stan Lee was unable to cameo in the sequel, as he did in the first film and the short \"No Good Deed\", but his likeness was used for a bust in the X-Mansion and for graffiti on a wall.\n\nProducer Simon Kinberg revealed in September 2015 that discussions had begun regarding ideas for a sequel to \"Deadpool\", which was set to be released in February 2016. One idea was for the film to introduce the character Cable, who had previously been looked at to appear in the first \"Deadpool\", and \"\" (2014) before that. Cable's inclusion in the potential sequel was confirmed by the character Deadpool while breaking the fourth wall in the post-credit scene of the first film. Domino, a character with connections to Cable in the comics, was also believed to be featured in the sequel. By the first film's release, 20th Century Fox had green-lit a sequel, with writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick returning to write the screenplay. Though director Tim Miller and producer/star Ryan Reynolds were not confirmed for the sequel at the time, Fox was \"intent on keeping the creative team together\". Miller and Reynolds' involvement was confirmed at the 2016 CinemaCon that April, though Miller had still not formally signed on to direct the sequel. He began work developing the script with the writers, while Reynolds had signed a new contract granting him \"casting approval and other creative controls\".\nIn June 2016, Kinberg expected filming to begin at the beginning of 2017. By August, Kyle Chandler was believed to be in the running to portray Cable. Testing of actresses for Domino had also begun by October, with the shortlist of actresses under consideration including Lizzy Caplan, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Sienna Miller, Sofia Boutella, Stephanie Sigman, Sylvia Hoeks, Mackenzie Davis, Ruby Rose, Eve Hewson, and Kelly Rohrbach. The producers were particularly interested in casting a black or Latina actress in the role.\n\nAt the end of October, Miller left the film over \"mutual creative differences\" with Reynolds, reportedly based on several factors, including Reynolds' expanded creative control over the sequel; Miller's wish for a more stylized follow-up than the first film, versus Reynolds' focus \"on the raunchy comedy style that earned the first movie its R rating\"; and Miller's intention to cast Chandler as Cable, which Reynolds opposed. Fox ultimately backed \"its marketable star\" over Miller, who had made his directorial debut with the first film. Miller denied this report, while Reynolds said he could only add that \"I'm sad to see him off the film. Tim's brilliant and nobody worked harder on \"Deadpool\" than he did.\" A week after Miller's departure, Fox was looking at David Leitch, Drew Goddard, Magnus Martens, and Rupert Sanders as potential replacements for the director. Leitch was the \"strong frontrunner\" for the role, and signed on a month later. Reynolds, a fan of Leitch's \"John Wick\", said the director \"really understands those \"Deadpool\" sensibilities and where we need to take the franchise\", and \"can make a movie on an ultra tight minimal budget look like it was shot for 10–15 times what it cost\".\n\nThe first completed draft from Wernick and Reese was expected around June 2016; multiple had been completed by January 2017. The pair felt a responsibility to explore the team X-Force, which includes Deadpool, Cable, and Domino in the comics, but to also keep the film focused on Deadpool. By the next month, the studio was still not happy with the script, with Reynolds and the writers \"bunkered down ... trying to cross the finish line and create something everyone is excited to make\". Goddard joined them as a consultant. Reese, Wernick, and Reynolds were credited for the script, the three having split the film's scenes between them before passing them around to be re-written by the others. Reese felt they were able to maintain \"one voice\" because of their long history with the character during development on the first film.\n\n\"Deadpool 2\" is set \"more or less\" when the first film ends, and focuses on \"an existential crisis and a deeply personal cause\" for Deadpool. Leitch felt that retaining these personal stakes was more compelling for audiences than trying to build the film around global stakes. The writers felt that the sequel was tonally similar to the first film, but wanted to explore a different theme by focusing on a group of individuals (X-Force) and their need for family, with Reynolds explaining that \"the first movie is a love story masquerading as a comic-book movie, and this one is kind of a family film masquerading as a comic-book film again.\" Deadpool spends around half of the film unmasked, which the writers wanted for exploring the more emotional scenes, though Reynolds was reluctant to do this because he found the make-up required to portray an unmasked Deadpool \"time consuming and really uncomfortable\". An early idea was to have the film begin five years after the first and explore Deadpool being a father, but the writers quickly decided that this was \"never, ever going to work\" and reworked the idea to explore the character wanting to have a child but being unable to.\n\nEarlier versions of the script included prominent roles for the characters Black Tom Cassidy and Sluggo, but they ultimately had a supporting role and a brief appearance, respectively. The villain Mr. X was also included in early drafts, but was cut due to the number of villains already in the film. The mutant inmates of the Ice Box were going to be explored more by having Cable breaking into the prison cause their power dampening collars to malfunction. This was removed from the script due to not being feasible within the film's budget. Leitch fought to include more aspects of Cable's backstory in the film after the writers chose to mostly ignore it due to it being convoluted; a painting of Cyclops which would have acknowledged that character as Cable's father was ultimately cut, but the Techno-Organic Virus that Cable is inflicted with and his daughter Hope are depicted. The film features contradictory connections to the various films of the franchise, which Leitch acknowledged as confusing but said that the issue had not really been discussed during development since the \"Deadpool\" films are considered their own \"entity\" in a way, and the character of Deadpool allows them to be \"flexible with the timeline, per se\".\n\nReese and Wernick preferred to use jokes in the film that only certain members of the audience would understand, though Reynolds would not allow some to be used if he thought not enough people would enjoy them (including a reference to golfer Davis Love III). Following the announcement of the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney in December 2017, the film includes several Disney related jokes including a running gag about the Disney film \"Frozen\" (2013). However, Fox did make the producers remove a joke from the film that directly acknowledged the deal, which Reynolds said \"was a wise decision\". Other cut jokes included many \"bizarre\" characters interviewing to join the X-Force, such as an idea to have Chris Evans reprise his role as the Human Torch from the \"Fantastic Four\" films.\n\nReese and Wernick confirmed in January 2017 that Stefan Kapičić's Colossus, Brianna Hildebrand's Negasonic Teenage Warhead, and Karan Soni's Dopinder would be returning from the first film to \"make at least an appearance\". By the beginning of March 2017, Michael Shannon had been in the running to portray Cable, but no longer could due to a scheduling conflict. David Harbour had screen-tested for the role, and Pierce Brosnan was believed to be in negotiations for a part in the film, potentially Cable. Reynolds announced shortly after that Zazie Beetz had been cast as Domino. Shannon was in the running to portray Cable again later in the month, and was considered the frontrunner ahead of a shortlist that also included Harbour. Brad Pitt was also considered for the role, but had \"moved on\". Leitch soon addressed the potential casting of these actors, saying Shannon \"would make an incredible Cable ... If that happens, I would be through the roof\"; and on Pitt, \"We had a great meeting with Brad, he was incredibly interested in the property. Things didn't work out schedule-wise [but] I think he would've made an amazing Cable.\" At the end of March, Morena Baccarin confirmed her return from the first film as Vanessa, and expressed interest in exploring the character's Copycat persona from the comics in the sequel. Josh Brolin emerged as a \"surprise contender\" to play Cable in April, ahead of Shannon and Harbour, and was officially cast in the role. Brolin also portrays the Marvel Comics character Thanos, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nAlso in April, Leslie Uggams confirmed that she would be reprising her role of Blind Al from the first film, while Fox gave the sequel a June 1, 2018 release date. Noting the release date, Leitch wanted to ensure that the film \"was worthy of a summer tentpole movie, and we knew we were going to be wedged in between some big films\", specifically wanting to expand the action and make the general feeling of the film \"bigger\" than the first one. However, he wanted the film to have the same DNA as the original \"in terms of the tone, and the fun ... I love that challenge\" of combining that with the increased scope. The film uses Deadpool's fourth wall-breaking to reference this release period, with Leitch calling these comments \"definitely fresh and timely when they come up\". In May 2017, Fox was reportedly looking to use a post-credits scene at the end of \"Deadpool 2\" to introduce several other members of X-Force who would go on to star alongside Reynolds, Brolin, and Beetz in an \"X-Force\" film. Casting for the characters—Sunspot, Feral, and Shatterstar—would take place over the coming months, though Reese denied the accuracy of this report. Later, T.J. Miller confirmed that he would return from the first film as Weasel, and described the sequel as \"even more weaselicious\" than the first. He noted that Reynolds and the writers had \"really put the time in on the script\" to meet their own expectations for the sequel as well as those of fans. Jack Kesy also joined the cast, as Black Tom Cassidy. In June, Shioli Kutsuna was cast in a key role for the film, Negasonic Teenage Warhead's girlfriend Yukio. The writers felt free to use the character in whatever way the film needed due to her having only a minor role in the comics.\n\nInitial filming had begun by June 17, 2017, at Hatley Castle in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, which is used to portray the X-Mansion in the \"X-Men\" films. Principal photography began in Vancouver, on June 26, under the working title \"Love Machine\". The East Lawn building of Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam served as the location for the final battle sequence. Jonathan Sela served as cinematographer for the film. At the end of June, Reynolds revealed that Julian Dennison had been cast in the film. The next month, T.J. Miller said that he found the sequel to be funnier than the first film, and that \"it's not going to be the same movie in a different location [like \"The Hangover Part II\"]. It's got different stakes, different things happen, some pretty tragic, dark shit happens in the first part of the film, in the beginning, and the rest of the film is kind of dealing with that.\" By then, Kapičić had been working with Leitch on set, and expected to continue contributing to Colossus through to April 2018. Production on the \"X-Men\" film \"Dark Phoenix\" was taking place in Montreal concurrently with the filming of \"Deadpool 2\", with Kinberg directing that film. He directed a brief moment where the X-Men are seen through an open door in the X-Mansion, which was added to \"Deadpool 2\" with the aid of green screen to allow those characters to appear in this film.\n\nLeitch worked closely with Sela, the pair having previously collaborated on Leitch's earlier films, to acknowledge the aesthetic of the first film while expanding the look of the sequel to match the new situations and characters introduced. The pair created specific shot lists and plans for blocking out scenes before they arrived on set, and were very particular about the colors they used; they planned the color palette of the entire film, and also produced color wheels detailing specific palettes for each set piece. These color wheels were sometimes adjusted several days into the filming of a sequence after digital intermediate work revealed a different look than Leitch and Sela had been anticipating. Elements that were carried over from the first film included the \"moodiness\" and saturation of scenes set in Deadpool's apartment, and the contrast with blacks in action sequences, while Cable's future had a new aesthetic unlike anything in the first film. Another example of these color wheels was the sequence in which Firefist is introduced, with Leitch taking advantage of the scene being set during day to overemphasize the lighting and create a general sepia/orange tone that represented the fire abilities the character displays. This aesthetic met the storytelling needs of the scene as well as the practicalities of the filmmaking process. Because the film was shot digitally, Sela worked with Vantage Film to develop custom lenses that created the \"texture and flavor\" he wanted for it where he otherwise would have manipulated the exposure and development of film stock to achieve the same effect.\nOn August 14, stunt woman Joi \"SJ\" Harris died in a motorcycle accident after losing control and crashing into Shaw Tower. Harris, the first African-American female professional road racer, was working on the film as a stunt performer for the first time and had only joined the production a week before. Harris was not wearing a helmet because the character she was portraying, Domino, does not wear one in the scene, and there had not been time since she joined the film to create one for her to fit underneath the Domino wig. She had two full days of rehearsing the stunt as well as five more attempts on the day of the accident. Veteran stunt double Melissa Stubbs had been available and willing to do the stunt, but the inexperienced Harris was preferred due to her skin color being a match for Beetz. This decision was criticized by multiple stunt professionals, with many noting that Harris' experiences racing motorcycles did not necessarily qualify her as an able stunt performer. Production was shut down immediately after the incident, but resumed two days later. With this news also came reports that the film's crew were \"enduring very long hours\" and were \"exhausted by the schedule\", with the studio confirming that some days had increased from the scheduled 12–13 hours filming to over 15 hours. The film's credits includes a dedication to the stuntwoman that reads \"In memory of Sequana Harris\".\n\nEarlier in August, Reynolds revealed that Rob Delaney was at the film's set, and Eddie Marsan revealed later in the month that he was also on set for a role in the film. Filming in Vancouver was expected to last until October 6, with production on \"Deadpool 2\" being officially completed on October 14. Discussing the film's action, having previously worked as a stunt coordinator, Leitch said that all stunts are \"variations on a theme\" with the same basic elements, but Deadpool allows you to \"subvert those basics, and there's an expectation for a classic gag, but oops, maybe you get something else\". He also felt that introducing Domino gave the film unique opportunities for action sequences taking advantage of her luck-based abilities, as well as focusing on Deadpool's healing abilities and trying to use those interestingly. Darrin Prescott served as second-unit director on the film, and Jonathan Eusebio was the stunt-coordinator for the film, both having worked on \"John Wick\" previously. Domino's abilities were envisioned as a Rube Goldberg machine \"on steroids\", while Deadpool allowing his arm to be broken during a fight was an example of his abilities being used. Unlike the first film, for which Fox was unwilling to pay for the writers to be on set, the studio did pay for Reese and Wernick to be on set for the sequel. Leitch was happy for this to happen, Reynolds wanted them to be there, and it allowed the pair to continue contributing to the script and suggest new jokes and ideas throughout the filming process.\nScroggins Aviation Mockup & Effects was hired to supply a CH-47 Chinook (s/n 90-00204) in the film. Scroggins made modification to the CH-47 and worked with SFX to rig it to a motion base (Gimbal), It would be the first time a real Chinook was placed on a motion base in a motion picture.\n\nFox revealed in November that the film was technically untitled at that point, and not officially known as \"Deadpool 2\" as had been assumed; the studio was temporarily referring to the film as \"The Untitled Deadpool Sequel\". Sexual misconduct allegations against T.J. Miller surfaced a month later, and by January 2018 some commentators had called for Miller to be replaced in the film in a similar manner to how Kevin Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer through reshoots in \"All the Money in the World\" (2017). Producer Lauren Shuler Donner addressed whether this would be possible, saying \"We're in the final editing. I don't think so.\" Miller was later arrested for calling in a false bomb threat; Reynolds would not comment on either issue, but stated that Miller would not be appearing in the \"X-Force\" film. Also in January, the film's release was moved up to May 18, 2018.\n\nIn February 2018, Terry Crews was revealed to have a role in the film, the character Shatterstar was confirmed to be appearing, and the production returned to Vancouver for six days of reshoots under a new working title, \"Daisy\". Some reports emerged by mid-March claiming that these reshoots were due to poor audience responses during test screenings of the film, and consisted of sweeping changes. However, the film was soon confirmed to be testing better than the original did, up to 98 out of 100 over three different tests (compared to a maximum score of 91 during tests of the first film). Because of this, the reshoots were adding more of the elements that audiences responded positively to, including additional material featuring Cable and Domino. Sam Hargrave joined the film as a stunt coordinator for the reshoots, trying to \"breathe some new life in a couple of sequences\". He highlighted a car chase which combines vehicles, actors, and green screen. By the end of the month, Pitt filmed a secret cameo appearance as the \"X-Force\" team member Vanisher during two hours of filming in Los Angeles, having been asked to shoot the part by Reynolds and agreeing to be paid \"scale\", which Reese described as the equivalent of a Starbucks coffee. This was the final photography work done for the film. The film's first full trailer officially titled the film \"Deadpool 2\", and revealed that Crews was portraying Bedlam; confirmed that Delaney would appear, portraying Peter; and that Bill Skarsgård also had a role. The film's final trailer, released a month later, confirmed that Lewis Tan would portray Shatterstar, joining Domino, Bedlam, and Peter as members of \"X-Force\". The group also includes Skarsgård's character, revealed to be Zeitgeist.\n\nOne scene that was cut from the film following test screenings was a post-credits scene featuring Deadpool travelling back in time to kill a baby Adolf Hitler. It was decided that the scene made audiences too \"squeamish\", which was not the feeling that the creative team wanted people to be leaving the film with. The film originally did not have any post- or mid- credits scenes, with the Hitler scene and the film's other time-traveling mid-credits scenes shot during additional photography. The latter came about when someone suggested the time travel device be used to fix real-world mistakes like Reynolds' role in \"Green Lantern\" which the writers felt was \"the funniest idea ever, and what a great idea to end the movie\". Additional footage of the X-Force team was shot for the film's marketing to hide the fact that the majority of the X-Force are immediately killed as a joke in the film. Due to Deadpool's mask, the creative team was able to change the character's dialogue up to the film being officially completed; Reynolds took this opportunity to keep adding new jokes to the film as long as possible.\n\nVisual effects for the characters of Colossus and Juggernaut were provided by Framestore. The model for Colossus was altered from the first film to make him more \"chiseled and angular\", and his movements were based on motion capture done by Andre Tricoteux on set. Tricoteux wore several metallic pieces, including a helmet and chest piece, as reference. Kapičić provided the character's facial performance. The character's \"iconic metal ridges\" were live textured by animators for the first film, but Framestore changed this to use a combination of shape movement and distortion so they could be more precise with the geometry of the lines. Juggernaut was represented on set by a stand-in, who wore a helmet extension to match the character's height. A full scale replica of the character's metal helmet was built for interacting with stunts on set, but the final version was completely digital along with the rest of the character. Framestore animators found it challenging to move the helmet in a way that the character could still move his head underneath it, and studied the movement of bodybuilders for the character. Juggernaut's face was modeled on Leitch's, and Reynolds provided facial capture for the character, but this was modified during the animation process. For the final fight between the two characters, two stuntmen who matched the height difference between the two were filmed on a motion capture stage for reference; this footage was edited into a previsualization.\n\nJunkie XL chose not to return for \"Deadpool 2\" after composing the score for the first film, given that Miller was \"the driving force behind\" him working on that film in the first place. In October 2017, it was confirmed that Tyler Bates would be writing the score for \"Deadpool 2\" after doing the same for Leitch's previous films. Bates approached the music with a slight rock sensibility, and used a distorted guitar run through a wah-wah pedal, microsynths to add \"unique colors\", and a choir. The choir originally sings lyrics such as \"you can't stop this motherfucker\" and \"holy shit balls!\", which ultimately earned the score a parental advisory warning. It is the first score album to receive such a warning. Bates felt this was not \"merit-less debauchery, it was just fun. It's very rare that we can work on something at such a high professional level that embraces the irreverence of Deadpool.\"\n\nLeitch wanted to create an original song for the film that served as an emotional through-line for all of the film's characters; the song \"Ashes\" was ultimately produced, as recorded by Céline Dion. Leitch directed a music video to go with the release of the song, and Reynolds both wanted to produce a music video to accompany the song; Leitch was initially conflicted about this, as he wanted audiences to discover the song, which was filmed in The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. It features dancer Yanis Marshall performing as Deadpool in high heels while Dion sings the song. The song was released as a single with the music video on May 3, 2018, before Sony Classical Records released a score album on May 11, and Columbia Records released an album featuring the songs from the film—including \"Ashes\"—on May 18.\n\nFor the Fox presentation at CineEurope 2017 in June, Reynolds made a video message featuring himself in costume as Deadpool from the film's set. The first teaser poster, which pays homage to Norman Rockwell's 1943 painting \"Freedom from Want\", was released that November. Justin Carter of Comic Book Resources found it \"oddly appropriate for \"Deadpool 2\" to co-opt [this] iconic work for a modern pop culture audience\" as it is \"true to Deadpool's incredibly referential nature\". Eric Diaz of Nerdist said, \"It strikes exactly the irreverent tone you'd expect for the \"Deadpool\" sequel.\" The first footage from the film debuted the following week, at the end of a video where Reynolds (in-character as Deadpool) parodies Bob Ross and his television show \"The Joy of Painting\". The video was described by \"The Hollywood Reporter\"s Ryan Parker as \"completely out of left field\" and setting the tone perfectly for the film, though his colleague Graeme McMillan was less positive due to not knowing of Ross (\"Deadpool\" co-creator Fabian Nicieza thought the fact that many in the audience wouldn't know of Ross made the video \"exactly the kind of quirky pop culture choice that works perfectly for \"Deadpool\"\"). Parker added, \"This trailer only showed a few seconds from the film, but fans will be talking about it all day\" because of the presentation, unlike \"any other trailer which would have shown so little of the product\".\n\nRather than pay for an expensive advertisement spot during Super Bowl LII, the film's official Twitter account was used to \"live tweet\" the event with in-character commentary from Deadpool. A new trailer for the film was released later that week, focusing on introducing Cable. Parker felt that \"Reynolds and company have completely changed the trailer game. The formula of just showing some of the actual movie, but with a tiny story thrown in is such an incredible marketing idea.\" McMillan and their colleague Aaron Couch praised the trailer playing on the visual effects for Cable's arm not being finished, noting it as a joke about the visual effects to remove Henry Cavill's mustache from \"Justice League\". The group collectively praised the overall marketing for the franchise, with McMillan suggesting that the campaign for the sequel may surpass that of the first \"Deadpool\". A full trailer for the film, explaining its general plot, was released at the end of March. \"Forbes\" contributor Scott Mendelson called it \"pretty funny and mostly entertaining\", but was disappointed in it being a \"conventional\" trailer compared to the more out-there videos previously released for the film. He explained that he thought the first film \"had a winning lead character and fine character-centric jokes, but a pretty generic origin story plot that eventually became the thing it was critiquing\", and was concerned that the sequel would turn out to be \"a more standard 'superhero sequel' sell\". Mendelson also noted the inclusion of T.J. Miller in the trailer following the reveal of sexual misconduct allegations against the actor in late 2017, calling it \"inevitable no matter how tarnished his reputation might be these days\". The \"Hollywood Reporter\" group also noted the more traditional style of the trailer, but remained generally positive about the film and highlighted the supporting cast for the film as appearing in the trailer, including Brolin, Beetz, Kutsuna, and Crews.\n\nAlso in March, a Twitter account was established for the character Peter and began to be regularly updated with tweets about his interests, including photos of the character beekeeping and preparing for his role in the \"X-Force\" team (as seen in the film). A month later, Fox released the final trailer for the film, with Mendelson lamenting that it was as \"conventional\" as the previous trailer but finding it understandable that Fox not be seen to be hiding the film, and ultimately felt that the trailer indicated the film would be \"a pretty solid comic book sequel\". The group at \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised the final trailer as well, highlighting its references to \"\" and the DC universe as well as its introduction of Peter. At the end of April, Leitch stated that alternate versions of jokes that had been cut from the film were included in the trailers, since \"only one can live in the movie, so we might have snuck a couple in sort of additional materials that people can discover.\" As part of a promotion for the film with beverage company Mike's Harder, the Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Girls fictional bar from the film was emulated in pop-ups at the Alligator Lounge in New York from April 26 through 28, and the Slipper Clutch in Los Angeles from May 10 through 12. The pop-ups respectively served pizza and chimichangas, traditionally Deadpool's favorite food, as well as \"Deadpool\"-inspired Harder drinks. The campaign also included the chance to win a trip to the film's premiere through Harder, and the Los Angeles pop-up benefitted the nonprofit DTLA Film Festival.\n\n\"Deadpool 2\" premiered at Leicester Square in London on May 10, 2018. It was released in the United States on May 18, 2018, having been previously scheduled for release on June 1 of that year.\n\nLeitch's initial cut of the film was around two hours and twelve minutes, with \"nips and tucks\" done to it to get the run time down to the final two hours. By May 2018, Leitch was working on an official extended edition of the film with Fox wanting to \"spin that out as a special thing\". He said it would be closer to his initial runtime and would include a cut montage of Deadpool trying to commit suicide in various ways, an extended sequence in the X-Mansion, and alternate versions of jokes that were not chosen for the film's theatrical version. The extended cut was screened at San Diego Comic-Con 2018 at an event titled \"Deadpool 2: Uncut Screening\". Ahead of the screening, a panel was held at the convention moderated by Soni and featuring other cast members. Some of the scenes cut from the theatrical version of the film were debuted at the panel.\n\nAt the end of September 2018, Fox announced that it would release an untitled \"Deadpool\" film in theaters on December 21. The studio suggested that press and fans \"guess away\" as to what this new film would be, but it was believed to be a re-cut version of \"Deadpool 2\" that would carry a PG-13 rating rather than being R-rated like the initial theatrical release. Reynolds hinted that the version of the film would feature Deadpool telling the story of the film to Fred Savage, parodying \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) in which a young Savage was told a bedtime story by Peter Falk who avoided \"the scary parts that were a bit too adult for the youngster\". Reese and Wernick revealed in October that the idea for the new version of the film was raised by Reynolds during a general discussion about the character following the film's initial release, and that Reynolds also suggested the framing device for the story. Reese and Wernick wrote new scenes for the new version, and Leitch returned to direct them during a single day in August. Wernick said the version would not just be for children who were unable to watch the R-rated release, as \"it's subversive enough and fun and creative and something that only \"Deadpool\" could do. So I think it's going to be a real joy for not only a whole new audience, but also an audience that has seen and loved the \"Deadpool\" movies.\" They added that the film's story would not change \"appreciably\" between versions. The majority of the version is the same as the theatrical release, but edited to \"meet PG-13 thresholds of violence and language\".\n\nFox officially announced \"Once Upon a Deadpool\" in November, and changed the release schedule to run from December 12 to 24. The studio considered the release to be a chance of a \"Christmas bonus\", and it also had the potential to be released in China unlike the R-rated version. After spending the entire development process of both \"Deadpool\" and \"Deadpool 2\" insisting to Fox that the films must be R-rated, Reynolds only agreed to support a PG-13 version of the film if a portion of the release's profit went to charity; Fox agreed to donate $1 for every ticket purchased for the film to the Fuck Cancer charity campaign, which would be temporarily renamed \"Fudge Cancer\" for the fundraising tie-in. At the end of November, writer and artist Michael Vincent Bramley noted that he had pitched the exact framing device that was being used for this version of the film to Reynolds on Twitter in December 2017. Within a day, Bramley had been contacted by Reynolds to discuss the issue and said, \"It seems like this may all just have been a big, insane coincidence and I'm happy to leave it at that.\"\n\nThe film was released on Digital HD on August 7, 2018, and physically on August 21. The latter release covered the 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD formats, including both the theatrical version and \"Super Duper $@%!#& Cut\" unrated extended edition. The physical release includes an audio commentary for the theatrical version in 4K Ultra HD and Blu-ray formats, from Reynolds, Leitch, Reese, and Wernick. The Blu-ray format also includes a gag reel, deleted and extended scenes, alternate takes, featurettes on Easter eggs, the cast and characters, Leitch's directing, and the action and stunts, and more.\n\n, \"Deadpool 2\" has grossed $318.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $415.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $734.2 million, against a production budget of $110 million. \n\nOn April 20, 2018, both Fandango and Regal Cinemas announced that \"Deadpool 2\" was the best pre-selling R-rated film in their respective histories. The film opened in 4,332 theaters, setting the record for widest R-rated release ever (beating the 4,103 count by \"It\" in September 2017). It made $18.6 million from Thursday night previews and $53.3 million on its first day, setting records for both by an R-rated film, beating \"It\"s $13.5 million and $50.4 million, respectively. The film went on to debut to $125.5 million, the second-best opening for an R-rated film behind the original, and became the first film to dethrone \"\" atop the box office. It fell 65.4% in its second weekend, grossing $43.5 million and finishing second behind newcomer \"\". The film made $23.2 million in its third weekend, remaining in second behind \"Solo\". It dropped 39% in both its fourth and fifth weekends, making a respective $14.1 million and $8.7 million.\n\nWorldwide, the film had a global debut of $300.4 million, including $174.9 million internationally, the largest-ever for an R-rated film or Fox release. It opened in 81 markets and finished first in all of them, including the United Kingdom ($18 million), Korea ($17 million), Russia ($11.8 million) and Australia ($11.7 million). It remained number one in 27 markets in its second weekend, making $57 million and bringing its foreign total through its first full week to $279.7 million. In its third week of international release the film made $47 million, including a $5.5 million debut in Japan (26% better than the first film), bringing its foreign total to $344 million.\n\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 345 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Though it threatens to buckle under the weight of its meta gags, \"Deadpool 2\" is a gory, gleeful lampoon of the superhero genre buoyed by Ryan Reynolds' undeniable charm.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on reviews from 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film. Audiences were 59% male and 41% female.\n\nRichard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, jokingly calling it the best sequel since \"The Godfather Part II\" and saying: \"\"Deadpool 2\" is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements [and] terrific ensemble work.\" \"PopMatters\" writer J.R. Kinnard wrote: \"If you enjoyed the guilty pleasures of \"Deadpool\", it's an immutable law of physics that you will love \"Deadpool 2\". The second verse may be the same as the first, but that verse is a dirty limerick of childish goodness.\" Michael Phillips of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote, \"\"Deadpool 2\" is just like \"Deadpool\" only more so. It's actually a fair bit better—funnier, more inventive than the 2016 smash...and more consistent in its chosen tone and style: ultraviolent screwball comedy.\"\n\nA.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" was critical of the cynical tone of the film, writing \"something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. Deadpool 2 dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks.\"\n\nBy November 2016, with development underway on \"Deadpool 2\", Fox was also planning \"Deadpool 3\", which was said to include the team X-Force. With the confirmation that Leitch would direct \"Deadpool 2\", it was revealed that Fox was looking for a separate filmmaker to direct \"Deadpool 3\". In March 2017, Reese clarified that though \"Deadpool 2\" sets-up the X-Force team, a future film focused on the team would be separate from \"Deadpool 3\", \"so I think we'll be able to take two paths. [\"X-Force\"] is where we're launching something bigger, but then [\"Deadpool 3\" is] where we're contracting and staying personal and small.\"\n\nAfter the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) under Disney, and that the company would be willing to make future R-rated Deadpool films \"as long as we let the audiences know what's coming\". In May 2018, Reynolds stated that a third Deadpool film may not be made given the franchise's shift of focus to X-Force, though Reese and Wernick felt a third film would \"absolutely\" be happening after Reynolds took a break from the character and \"X-Force\" was released, which they compared to the \"Iron Man\" franchise having \"Iron Man 3\" (2013) release after the crossover film \"The Avengers\" (2012). Also, Leitch expressed interest in returning to the franchise, saying, \"I would be grateful to work on something [starring Reynolds' Deadpool] again. It just depends on time and place, so we'll see what happens.\"\n\nThe \"Once Upon a Deadpool\" version of the film was being watched carefully by Disney and Marvel Studios to see whether it might inform how they could approach the character and integrate him into the PG-13 MCU.\n\n"}

The scale was created by the American Whitewater Association to evaluate rivers throughout the world, hence \"international\" in the title. \nIt should not be confused with the internationally used whitewater scale, which is published and adapted by a committee of the International Canoe Federation ICF. \nThe grade reflects the technical difficulty and skill level required associated with the section of river. The scale is of use to various water sports and activities, such as rafting, riverboarding, whitewater canoeing, stand up paddle surfing, and whitewater kayaking.\n\nThere are six categories, each referred to as \"Grade\" or \"Class\" followed by a number. The scale is not linear, nor is it fixed. For instance, there can be difficult grade twos, easy grade threes, and so on. The grade of a river may (and usually does) change with the level of flow. Often a river or rapid will be given a numerical grade, and then a plus (+) or minus (-) to indicate if it is in the higher or lower end of the difficulty level. While a river section may be given an overall grading, it may contain sections above that grade, often noted as features, or conversely, it may contain sections of lower graded water as well. Details of portages may be given if these pose specific challenges. A summary of river classifications as presented by the American Whitewater Association:\n\nClassifications can vary enormously, depending on the skill level and experience of the paddlers who rated the river. For example, at the 1999 International Conference on Outdoor Recreation and Education, an author of a paddling guide pointed out that there is too much variation in what is covered by the Class I designation, and proposed making further distinctions within the Class I flat water designations and Class I+ moving water designations, with the goal of providing better information for canoeists, instructors leading trips, and families with young children.\n\nThe grade of a river or rapid is likely to change along with the level of the water. High water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous, although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or washed out. At spate/flood stage, even rapids which are usually easy can contain lethal and unpredictable hazards. Conversely, some rapids may be easier with lower water levels when dangerous hydraulics become easier to manage. Some rivers with high volumes of fast moving water may require little maneuvering, but will pose serious risk of injury or death in the event of a capsize.\n\n"}
{"id": "1812233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1812233", "title": "Jesus in comparative mythology", "text": "Jesus in comparative mythology\n\nThe study of Jesus in comparative mythology is the examination of the narratives of the life of Jesus in the Christian gospels, traditions and theology, as they relate to Christianity and other religions. Although virtually all New Testament scholars and historians of the ancient Near East agree that Jesus existed as a historical figure, most secular historians also agree that the gospels contain large quantities of ahistorical legendary details mixed in with historical information about Jesus's life. The Synoptic Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke are heavily shaped by Jewish tradition, with the Gospel of Matthew deliberately portraying Jesus as a \"new Moses\". Although it is highly unlikely that the authors of the Synoptic Gospels directly based any of their stories on pagan mythology, it is possible that they may have subtly shaped their accounts of Jesus's healing miracles to resemble familiar Greek stories about miracles associated with Asclepius, the god of healing and medicine. The birth narratives of Matthew and Luke are usually seen by secular historians as legends designed to fulfill Jewish expectations about the Messiah.\n\nThe Gospel of John bears indirect influences from Platonism, via earlier Jewish deuterocanonical texts, and may also have been influenced in less obvious ways by the cult of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, though this possibility is still disputed. Later Christian traditions about Jesus were probably influenced by Greco-Roman religion and mythology. Much of Jesus's traditional iconography is apparently derived from Mediterranean deities such as Hermes, Asclepius, Serapis, and Zeus and his traditional birthdate on 25 December, which was not declared as such until the fifth century, was at one point named a holiday in honor of the Roman sun god Sol Invictus. At around the same time Christianity was expanding in the second and third centuries, the Mithraic Cult was also flourishing. Though the relationship between the two religions is still under dispute, Christian apologists at the time noted similarities between them, which some scholars have taken as evidence of borrowing, but which are more likely a result of shared cultural environment. More general comparisons have also been made between the stories about Jesus's birth and resurrection and stories of other divine or heroic figures from across the Mediterranean world, including supposed \"dying-and-rising gods\" such as Tammuz, Adonis, Attis, and Osiris, while the concept of \"dying-and-rising gods\" has received criticism.\n\nVirtually all New Testament scholars and historians of the ancient Near East, applying the standard criteria of historical investigation, agree that Jesus existed as a historical figure. While some scholars have criticized Jesus scholarship for religious bias and lack of methodological soundness, with very few exceptions such critics generally do support the historicity of Jesus and reject the Christ myth theory that Jesus never existed. There is widespread disagreement among scholars about the accuracy of details of Jesus's life as it is described in the gospel narratives, and on the meaning of his teachings, and the only two events subject to \"almost universal assent\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and that he was crucified under the orders of the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate. It is also generally, although not universally, accepted that Jesus was a Galilean Jew who called disciples and whose activities were confined to Galilee and Judea, that he had a controversy in the Temple, and that, after his crucifixion, his ministry was continued by a group of his disciples, several of whom were persecuted.\n\nNonetheless, most secular scholars generally agree that the gospels contain large amounts of material that is not historically accurate and is better categorized as legend. In a discussion of genuinely legendary episodes from the gospels, theologian Bart Ehrman mentions the birth narratives in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke and the release of Barabbas. He points out, however, that, just because these stories are not true does not mean that Jesus himself did not exist. According to theologians Paul R. Eddy and Gregory A. Boyd, there is no evidence that the portrayal of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels (the three earliest gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke) was directly influenced by pagan mythology in any significant way. The earliest followers of Jesus were devout Palestinian Jews who abhorred paganism and would have therefore been extremely unlikely to model stories about their founder on pagan myths.\n\nDespite this, several scholars have noticed that some of the healing miracles of Jesus recorded in the Synoptic Gospels bear similarities to Greek stories of miracles associated with Asclepius, the god of healing and medicine. Brennan R. Hill states that Jesus's miracles are, for the most part, clearly told in the context of the Jewish belief in the healing power of Yahweh, but notes that the authors of the Synoptic Gospels may have subtly borrowed from Greek literary models. He states that Jesus's healing miracles chiefly differ from those of Asclepius by the fact that Jesus's are attributed to a human being on earth; whereas Asclepius's miracles are performed by a distant god. According to classical historians Emma J. Edelstein and Ludwig Edelstein, the most obvious difference between Jesus and Asclepius is that Jesus extended his healing to \"sinners and publicans\"; whereas Asclepius, as a god, refused to heal those who were ritually impure and confined his healing solely to those who thought pure thoughts. Scholars disagree whether the parable of the rich man and Lazarus recorded in originates with Jesus or if it is a later Christian invention, but the story bears strong resemblances to various folktales told throughout the Near East.\n\nIt is, however, widely agreed that the portrayal of Jesus in the gospels is deeply influenced by Jewish tradition. According to E. P. Sanders, a leading scholar on the historical Jesus, the Synoptic Gospels contain many episodes in which Jesus's described actions clearly emulate those of the prophets in the Hebrew Bible. Sanders states that, in some of these cases, it is impossible to know for certain whether these parallels originate from the historical Jesus himself having deliberately imitated the Hebrew prophets, or from later Christians inventing mythological stories in order to portray Jesus as one of them, but, in many other instances, the parallels are clearly the work of the gospel-writers. The author of the Gospel of Matthew in particular intentionally seeks to portray Jesus as a \"new Moses\". Matthew's account of Herod's attempt to kill the infant Jesus, Jesus's family's flight into Egypt, and their subsequent return to Judaea is a mythical narrative based on the account of the Exodus in the Torah. In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus delivers his first public sermon on a mountain in imitation of the giving of the Law of Moses atop Mount Sinai. According to New Testament scholars Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, the teachings preserved in the sermon are statements that Jesus himself really said on different occasions that were originally recorded without context, but the author of the Gospel of Matthew compiled them into an organized lecture and invented context for them in order to fit his portrayal of Jesus as a \"new Moses\".\n\nAccording to Sanders, the birth narratives in Matthew and Luke are the clearest examples of legends in the Synoptic Gospels. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth, but they present two completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. The accounts of the Annunciation of Jesus's conception found in and are both modeled on the stories of the annunciations of Ishmael, Isaac, and Samson in the Old Testament. Matthew quotes from the Septuagint translation of to support his account of the virgin birth of Jesus. The Hebrew text of this verse states \"Behold, the young woman [\"ha‘almāh\"] is with child and about to bear a son and she will call him Immanuel.\" The Septuagint, however, translates the Hebrew word \"‘almāh\", which literally means \"young woman\", as the Greek word παρθένος (\"parthenos\"), which means \"virgin\". Most secular historians therefore generally see the two separate accounts of the virgin birth from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke as independent legendary inventions designed to fulfill the mistranslated passage from Isaiah. Sanders clarifies that the birth narratives are \"an extreme case\" resulting from the authors of the gospels lack of knowledge about Jesus's birth and childhood; no other part of the gospels relies so heavily on Old Testament parallels. Sanders also notes that, despite the clearly intentional parallels, the \"striking differences\" between Jesus and the prophets of the Old Testament are also highly significant and the gospels' accounts of Jesus's life on the whole do not closely resemble the lives of any of the figures in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nAlthough Jesus's crucifixion is one of the few events in his life that virtually all scholars of all different backgrounds agree really happened, historians of religion have also compared it to Greek and Roman stories in order to gain a better understanding of how non-Christians would have perceived stories of Jesus's crucifixion. The German historian of religion Martin Hengel notes that the Hellenized Syrian satirist Lucian of Samosata (\"the Voltaire of antiquity\"), in his comic dialogue \"Prometheus\", written in the second century AD (about two hundred years after Jesus), describes the god Prometheus being fastened to two rocks in the Caucasus Mountains using all the terminology of a Roman crucifixion: he is nailed through the hands in such a manner as to produce \"a most serviceable cross\" (\"ἐπικαιρότατος... ὁ σταυρος\"). The gods Hermes and Hephaestus, who perform the binding, are shown as slaves whose brutal master Zeus threatens with the same punishment if they weaken. Unlike the crucifixion of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels, Lucian's crucifixion of Prometheus is a deliberate, angry mockery of the gods, intended to show Zeus as a cruel and capricious tyrant undeserving of praise or adoration. This is the only instance from all of classical literature in which a god is apparently crucified and the fact that the Greeks and Romans could only conceive of a god being crucified as a form of \"malicious parody\" demonstrates the kind of horror with which they would have regarded Christian stories of Jesus's crucifixion.\n\nAmerican theologian Dennis R. MacDonald has argued that the Gospel of Mark is, in fact, a Jewish retelling of the \"Odyssey\", with its ending derived from the \"Iliad\", that uses Jesus as its central character in the place of Odysseus. According to MacDonald, the gospels are primarily intended to show Jesus as superior to Greek heroes and, although Jesus himself was a real historical figure, the gospels should be read as works of historical fiction centered on a real protagonist, not as accurate accounts of Jesus's life. MacDonald's thesis that the gospels are modeled on the Homeric Epics has been met with intense skepticism in scholarly circles due to its almost complete reliance on extremely vague and subjective parallels. Other scholars state that his argument is also undermined by the fact that the Gospel of Mark never directly quotes from either of the Homeric Epics and uses completely dissimilar language. Pheme Perkins also notes that many of the incidents in the Gospel of Mark that MacDonald claims are derived from the \"Odyssey\" have much closer parallels in the Old Testament. MacDonald's argument, in a misunderstood form, has nonetheless become popular in non-scholarly circles, mostly on the internet, where it is used to support the Christ Myth theory. MacDonald himself rejects this interpretation as too drastic.\n\nThe Gospel of John, the latest of the four canonical gospels, was influenced by ideas from Platonism. The \"Logos\" described in John's prologue is originally a concept from Greek philosophy, devised by the Pre-Socratic philosopher Heraclitus and adapted to Judaism by the Jewish Middle Platonist Philo of Alexandria. However, the author of the Gospel of John probably did not borrow the Logos theology from Platonic texts directly; instead, these sources probably influenced earlier Jewish deuterocanonical texts, which John inherited and expanded his own Logos theology from. In Platonic terminology, Logos was a universal force that represented the rationality and intelligibility of the world. On the other hand, as adapted into Judaism, Logos becomes a mediating divine figure between God and man and mostly owed influence from Wisdom literature, and by the time it was transmitted into Judaism, seems to have retained the concept of the universality of the Platonic logos. Davies and Finkelstein write \"This primeval and universal Wisdom had, at God's command, found itself a home on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. This mediatorial figure, which in its universality can be compared with the Platonic 'world-soul' or the Stoic 'logos', is here exclusively connected with Israel, God's chosen people, and with his sanctuary.\"\n\nScholars have long suspected that the Gospel of John may have also been influenced by symbolism associated with the cult of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine. The issue of whether the Gospel of John was truly influenced by the cult of Dionysus is hotly disputed, with reputable scholars passionately defending both sides of the argument. Dionysus was one of the best-known Greek deities; he was worshipped throughout most of the Greco-Roman world and his cult is attested in Palestine, Asia Minor, and Italy. At the same time, other scholars have argued that it is highly implausible that the devout Christian author of the Gospel of John would have deliberately incorporated Dionysian imagery into his account and instead argue that the symbolism of wine in the Gospel of John is much more likely to be based on the many references to wine found throughout the Old Testament. In response to this objection, proponents of Dionysian influence have argued that it is possible that the author of the Gospel of John may have used Dionysian imagery in effort to show Jesus as \"superior\" to Dionysus.\n\nThe first instance of possible Dionysian influence is Jesus's miracle of turning water into wine at the Marriage at Cana in . The story bears some resemblance to a number of stories that were told about Dionysus. Dionysus's close associations with wine are attested as early as the writings of Plato and the second-century AD Greek geographer Pausanias describes a ritual in which Dionysus was said to fill empty barrels that had been left locked inside a temple overnight with wine. In the Greek novel \"Leucippe and Clitophon\" by Achilles Tatius, written in the first or second century AD, a herdsman takes Dionysus into his home and offers him a meal, but can only offer him the same thing to drink as his oxen. Miraculously, Dionysus turns the drink into wine. The account of turning water into wine does not occur in any of the Synoptic Gospels and is only found in the Gospel of John, indicating that the author of the fourth gospel may have invented it. A second occurrence of possible Dionysian influence is the allegory found in , in which Jesus declares himself to be the \"True Vine\", a title reminiscent of Dionysus, who was said to have discovered the first grape vine.\n\nMark S. W. Stibbe has argued that the Gospel of John also contains parallels with \"The Bacchae\", a tragedy written by the Athenian playwright Euripides that was first performed in 405 BC and involves Dionysus as a central character. In both works, the central figure is portrayed as an incarnate deity who arrives in a country where he should be known and worshipped, but, because he is disguised as a mortal, the deity is not recognized and is instead persecuted by the ruling party. In the Gospel of John, Jesus is portrayed as elusive, intentionally making ambiguous statements to evade capture, much like Dionysus in Euripides's \"Bacchae\". In both works, the deity is supported by a group of female followers. Both works end with the violent death of one of the central figures; in John's gospel it is Jesus himself, but in \"The Bacchae\" it is Dionysus's cousin and adversary Pentheus, the king of Thebes.\n\nStibbe emphasizes that two accounts are also radically different, but states that they share similar themes. One of the most obvious differences is that, in \"The Bacchae\", Dionysus has come to advocate a philosophy of wine and hedonism; whereas Jesus in the Gospel of John has come to offer his followers salvation from sin. Euripides portrays Dionysus as aggressive and violent; whereas the Gospel of John shows Jesus as peaceful and full of mercy. Furthermore, \"The Bacchae\" is set within an explicitly polytheistic world, but the Gospel of John admits the existence of only two gods: Jesus himself and his Father in Heaven.\n\nThe Infancy Gospel of Thomas is a short apocryphal gospel, probably written in the second century AD, describing Jesus's childhood. It is unique as the only purported account of Jesus's childhood to survive from early Christian times. It describes a variety of miracles attributed to the young Jesus. It remained continuously in popular use throughout the Middle Ages up until the time of the Reformation. Reidar Aasgaard has argued that the Infancy Gospel may have been partially intended for children and discusses how the stories in the gospel fit the genre of Greco-Roman fairy tales. J. R. C. Cousland argues that the Infancy Gospel may have been originally written for a primarily pagan audience, noting that the Greeks and Romans told stories about their gods' miraculous doings as children and that miracle stories were often instrumental in converting pagans to Christianity.\n\nAround the same time that Christianity was expanding, the cult of the god Mithras was also spreading throughout the Roman Empire. Very little is known for certain about the Mithraic cult because it was a \"Mystery Cult\", meaning its members were forbidden from disclosing what the cult believed to outsiders. No Mithraic sacred texts have survived, if any such writings ever existed. Consequently, it is disputed how much influence Christianity and Mithraism may have had on each other. Michael Patella states that the similarities between Christianity and Mithraism are more likely a result of their shared cultural environment rather than direct borrowing from one to the other. Christianity and Mithraism were both of Oriental origin and their practices and respective savior figures were both shaped by the social conditions in the Roman Empire during the time period.\n\nMost of what is known about the legendary life of Mithras comes from archaeological excavation of Mithraea, underground Mithraic sanctuaries of worship, which were found all across the Roman world. Like Jesus, Mithras was seen as a divine savior, but, unlike Jesus, Mithras was not believed to have brought his salvation by suffering and dying. Mithras was believed to have been born fully-grown from a rock, a belief which is confirmed by a vast number of surviving sculptures showing him rising from the rock nude except for a Phrygian cap, clutching a sword in his right hand and a torch in his left. In many depictions, the rock is also encircled by a snake. In Mithraic cults primarily from the Rhine-Danube region, there are also representations of a myth in which Mithras shoots an arrow at a rock face, causing water to gush forth. This myth is one of the closest parallels between Mithras and Jesus. Both Christians and Mithraists used water as a symbol for their respective saviors. In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the \"water of life\" and a votive altar to Mithras from Poetovio proclaims him as the \"fons perennis\" (\"the ever-flowing stream\").\n\nIn the center of every Mithraeum was a \"tauroctony\", a painting or sculpture showing Mithras as a young man, usually wearing a cape and Phrygian cap, plunging a knife into the neck or shoulder of a bull as he turns its head towards him, simultaneously turning his own head away. A dog laps up the blood pouring from the bull's wound, from which emerges an ear of corn, as a scorpion stings the bull's scrotum. Human torchbearers stand on either side of the scene, one holding his torch upright and other upside-down. A serpent is also present. The exact interpretation of this scene is unclear, but the image certainly depicts a narrative central to Mithraism and the figures in it appear to correspond to the signs of the zodiac. The closest parallel between Jesus and Mithras is the use of a ritual meal. After slaying the bull, Mithras was believed to have shared the bull's meat with the sun-god Sol Invictus, a meal which is shown in Mithraic iconography and which was ritually reenacted by Mithraists as part of their liturgy. Manfred Clauss, a scholar of the Mithraic cult, speculates that the similarities between Christianity and Mithraism may have made it easier for members of the Mithraic cult to convert to Christianity without having to give up their ritual meal, sun-imagery, candles, incense, or bells, a trend which might explain why, as late as the sixth century, the Christian Church was still trying to stamp out the \"stulti homines\" who still paid obeisance to the sun every morning on the steps of the church itself.\n\nA few Christian apologists from the second and third centuries, who had never been members of the Mithraic cult and had never spoken to its members, claimed that the practices of the Mithraic cult were copied off Christianity. The second-century Christian apologist Justin Martyr writes in his \"First Apology\", after describing the Christian Eucharist, that \"...the wicked devils have imitated [this] in the mysteries of Mithras, commanding the same thing to be done. For, that bread and a cup of water are placed with certain incantations in the mystic rites of one who is being initiated, you either know or can learn.\" The later apologist Tertullian writes in his \"De praescriptione haereticorum\":\n\nThe devil (is the inspirer of the heretics) whose work it is to pervert the truth, who with idolatrous mysteries endeavours to imitate the realities of the divine sacraments. Some he himself sprinkles as though in token of faith and loyalty; he promises forgiveness of sins through baptism; and if my memory does not fail me marks his own soldiers with the sign of Mithra on their foreheads, commemorates an offering of bread, introduces a mock resurrection, and with the sword opens the way to the crown. Moreover has he not forbidden a second marriage to the supreme priest? He maintains also his virgins and his celibates.\n\nAccording to Ehrman, these writers were ideologically motivated to portray Christianity and Mithraism as similar because they wanted to persuade pagan officials that Christianity was not so different from other religious traditions, so that these officials would realize that there was no reason to single Christians out for persecution. These apologists therefore intentionally exaggerated similarities between Christianity and Mithraism to support their arguments. Scholars are generally wary of trusting anything these sources have to say about the Mithraic cult's alleged practices.\n\nIn late antiquity, early Christians frequently adapted pagan iconography to suit Christian purposes. This does not in any way indicate that Christianity itself was derived from paganism, only that early Christians made use of the pre-existing symbols that were readily available in their society. Sometimes Christians deliberately used pagan iconography in conscious effort to show Jesus as superior to the pagan gods. In classical iconography, the god Hermes was sometimes shown as a \"kriophoros\", a handsome, beardless youth bearing a ram or sheep over his shoulders. In late antiquity, this image developed a generic association with philanthropy. Early Christians adapted images of this kind as representations of Jesus in his role of as the \"Good Shepherd\".\n\nEarly Christians also identified Jesus with the Greek hero Orpheus, who was said to have tamed wild beasts with the music of his lyre. The Church Father Clement of Alexandria writes that Orpheus and Jesus are similar in that they have both been subject to admiration on account of their \"songs\", but insists that Orpheus misused his gift of eloquence by persuading people to worship idols and \"tie themselves to temporal things\"; whereas Jesus, the singer of the \"New Song\" brings peace to men and frees them from the bonds of the flesh. The later Christian historian Eusebius, drawing on Clement, also compares Orpheus to Jesus for having both brought peace to men. One unusual possible instance of identification between Jesus and Orpheus is a hematite gem inscribed with the image of a crucified man identified as ΟΡΦΕΩΣ ΒΑΚΧΙΚΟΣ (\"Orpheos Bacchikos\"). The gem has long been suspected to be a forgery created in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, but, if authentic, it may date to the late second or early third century AD. If authentic, the gem would represent a remarkable instance of pagans adopting Christian iconography, rather than \"vice versa\" as is generally more common. The gem was formerly housed at the Altes Museum in Berlin, but was lost or destroyed during World War II.\n\nEarly Christians found it hard to criticize Asclepius because, while their usual tactics were to denounce the absurdity of believing in gods who were merely personifications of nature and to accuse pagan gods of being immoral, neither of these could be applied to Asclepius, who was never portrayed as a personification of nature and whose stories were inscrutably moral. The early Christian apologist Justin Martyr argued that believing in Jesus's divinity should not be hard for pagans, since it was no different from believing in the divinity of Asclepius. Eventually, Christians adapted much of the iconography of Asclepius to suit the miracles of Jesus. Images of Jesus as a healer replaced images of Asclepius and Hippocrates as the ideal physician. Jesus, who was originally shown as clean-shaven, may have first been shown as bearded as a result of this syncretism with Asclepius, as well as other bearded deities such as Zeus and Serapis. A second-century AD head of Asclepius was discovered underneath a fourth-century AD Christian church in Gerasa, Jordan.\n\nIn some depictions from late antiquity, Jesus was shown with the halo of the sun god Sol Invictus. Images of \"Christ in Majesty\" seated upon a throne were inspired by classical depictions of Zeus and other chief deities. By the fourth century AD, the recognizable image of Jesus as long-haired, bearded, and clad in long, baggy-sleeved clothing had fully emerged. This widespread adaptation of pagan iconography to suit Jesus did not sit well with many Christians. A fragment of a lost work by Theodor Lector preserves a miracle story dated to around 465 AD in which the bishop Gennadius of Constantinople was said to have healed an artist who had lost all strength in his hand after painting an image of Christ showing him with long, curly hair, parted in the same manner as traditional representations of Zeus.\n\nChristians also may have adapted the iconography of the Egyptian goddess Isis nursing her son Horus and applied it to the Virgin Mary nursing her son Jesus. Some Christians also may have conflated stories about the Egyptian god Osiris with the resurrection of Jesus. The title of \"kosmokrateros\" (\"Ruler of the Cosmos\"), which was eventually applied to Jesus, had previously been borne by Serapis. The Church Father Jerome records in a letter dated to the year 395 AD that \"Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, that is to say, Adonis, and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of Venus was lamented.\" This same cave later became the site of the Church of the Nativity. The church historian Eusebius, however, does not mention pagans having ever worshipped in the cave, nor do any other early Christian writers. Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual over Tammuz's death. Joan E. Taylor has countered this argument by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz. During the sixth century AD, some Christians in the Middle East borrowed elements from poems of Tammuz's wife Ishtar mourning over her husband's death into their own retellings of the Virgin Mary mourning over the death of her son Jesus. The Syrian writers Jacob of Serugh and Romanos the Melodist both wrote laments in which the Virgin Mary describes her compassion for her son at the foot of the cross in deeply personal terms closely resembling Ishtar's laments over the death of Tammuz.\n\nThe Bible never states when Jesus was born, but, by late antiquity, Christians had begun celebrating his birth on 25 December. In 274 AD, the Roman emperor Aurelian had declared 25 December the birthdate of Sol Invictus, a sun god of Syrian origin whose cult had been vigorously promoted by the earlier emperor Elagabalus. Christians may have thought that they could attract more converts to Christianity by allowing them to continue to celebrate on the same day. 25 December also falls around the same time as the Roman festival of Saturnalia, which was much older and more widely celebrated. Many of the customs originally associated with Saturnalia eventually became associated with Christmas. Early Christians may have also been influenced by the idea that Jesus had died on the anniversary of his conception; because Jesus died during Passover and, in the third century AD, Passover was celebrated on 25 March, they may have assumed that Jesus's birthday must have come nine months later, on 25 December.\n\nAspects of Jesus's life as recorded in the gospels bear some similarities to various other figures, both historical and mythological. Proponents of the Christ Myth theory frequently exaggerate these similarities as part of their efforts to claim that Jesus never existed as a historical figure. Maurice Casey, the late Emeritus Professor of New Testament Languages and Literature at the University of Nottingham, writes that these parallels do not in any way indicate that Jesus was invented based on pagan \"divine men\", but rather that he was simply not as perfectly unique as many evangelical Christians frequently claim he was.\n\nClassical mythology is filled with stories of miraculous births of various kinds, but, in most cases of divine offspring from classical mythology, the father is a god who engages in literal sexual intercourse with the mother, a mortal woman, causing her to give birth to a son who is literally half god and half man. A possible pagan precursor to the Christian story of the virgin birth of Jesus is an Athenian legend recounted by the mythographer Pseudo-Apollodorus. According to this account, Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths, once attempted to rape Athena, the virgin goddess of wisdom, but she pushed him away, causing him to ejaculate on her thigh. Athena wiped the semen off using a tuft of wool, which she tossed into the dust, impregnating Gaia and causing her to give birth to Erichthonius, whom Athena adopted as her own child. Thus, Athena was able to produce a \"son\" without her losing her virginity. The Roman mythographer Hyginus records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since he was the one who had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born. Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married, but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.\n\nAnother comparable story from Greek mythology describes the conception of the hero Perseus. According to the myth, Zeus came to Perseus's mother Danaë in the form of a shower of gold and impregnated her. Although no surviving Greek text ever describes this as a \"virgin birth\", the early Christian apologist Justin Martyr has his Jewish speaker Trypho refer to it as such in his \"Dialogue with Trypho\". Scholars have also compared the story of the virgin birth to the complex narratives revolving around the birth of Dionysus. In most versions of the conception of Dionysus, Zeus was said to have come to the mortal woman Semele disguised as a mortal and had sex with her. Zeus's wife Hera disguised herself as Semele's nurse and persuaded her to ask Zeus to show her his true, divine form. Zeus eventually agreed, but, upon revealing his divine form, Semele was instantly incinerated by his lightning. Zeus rescued the unborn infant Dionysus and sewed him inside his own thigh, giving birth to him himself when it was time. In an alternative version of the story told by the Roman mythographer Hyginus, Dionysus was actually the son of Zeus and Persephone, who was torn apart by the Titans. Zeus rescued Dionysus's heart, ground it up, and mixed it into a potion, which he gave to Semele to drink, causing her to become pregnant with the infant who had been killed.\n\nAccording to M. David Litwa, the authors of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke consciously attempt to avoid portraying Jesus's conception as anything resembling pagan accounts of divine parentage; the author of the Gospel of Luke tells a similar story about the conception of John the Baptist in effort to emphasize the Jewish character of Jesus's birth. Nonetheless, Litwe argues that the accounts are unconsciously influenced by pagan stories of divine men, despite their authors' efforts to avert this. Other stories of virgin births similar to Jesus's are referenced by later Christian writers. The third-century AD Christian theologian Origen retells a legend that Plato's mother Perictione had virginally conceived him after the god Apollo had appeared to her husband Ariston and told him not to consummate his marriage with his wife, a scene closely paralleling the account of the Annunciation to Joseph from the Gospel of Matthew. Origen interpreted this story and others like it as prefiguring the reality made manifest by Jesus's virginal conception. In the fourth century, the bishop Epiphanius of Salamis protested that, in Alexandria, at the temple of Kore-Persephone, the pagans enacted a \"hideous mockery\" of the Christian Epiphany in which they claimed that \"Today at this hour Kore, that is the virgin, has given birth to Aion.\"\n\nFolklorist Alan Dundes has argued that Jesus fits all but five of the twenty-two narrative patterns in the Rank-Raglan mythotype, and therefore more closely matches the archetype than many of the heroes traditionally cited to support it, such as Jason, Bellerophon, Pelops, Asclepius, Joseph, Elijah, and Siegfried. Dundes sees Jesus as a historical \"miracle-worker\" or \"religious teacher\", stories of whose life were told and retold through oral tradition so many times that they became legend. Dundes states that analyzing Jesus in the context of folklore helps explain some of the anomalies of the gospels, such as the fact that none of them give any information about Jesus’s childhood and adolescence, which Dundes explains by the fact that this is \"precisely the case for almost all heroes of tradition\". Other scholars have strongly criticized Dundes's application of the Rank-Raglan mythotype to Jesus, pointing out that Dundes draws the narrative patterns from different texts written centuries apart, without taking care to differentiate between them. Dundes's application has also been criticized due to the Rank-Raglan mythotype's artificial nature and its lack of specificity to Hellenistic culture. Nonetheless, Lawrence M. Wills states that the \"hero paradigm \"in some form\" does apply to the earliest lives of Jesus\", albeit not to the extreme extent that Dundes has argued.\n\nThe late nineteenth-century Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer wrote extensively about the existence of a \"dying-and rising god\" archetype in his monumental study of comparative religion \"The Golden Bough\" (the first edition of which was published in 1890) as well as in later works. Frazer's main intention was to prove that all religions were fundamentally the same and that all the essential features of Christianity could be found in earlier religions. Although Frazer himself did not explicitly claim that Jesus was a \"dying-and-rising god\" of the supposedly typical Near Eastern variety, he strongly implied it. Frazer's claims became widely influential in late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century scholarship of religion, but are now mostly rejected modern scholars.\n\nThe main examples of \"dying-and-rising gods\" discussed by Frazer were the Mesopotamian god Dumuzid/Tammuz, his Greek equivalent Adonis, the Phrygian god Attis, and the Egyptian god Osiris. Dumuzid/Tammuz was a god of Sumerian origin associated with vegetation and fertility who eventually came to be worshipped across the Near East. Dumuzid was associated with springtime agricultural fertility and, when the crops withered during the hot summer months, women would mourn over his death. Tammuz's categorization as a \"dying-and-rising god\" was based on the abbreviated Akkadian redaction of \"Inanna's Descent into the Underworld\", which was missing the ending. Since numerous lamentations over the death of Dumuzid had already been translated, scholars filled in the missing ending by assuming that the reason for Ishtar's descent was because she was going to resurrect Dumuzid and that the text could therefore be assumed to end with Tammuz's resurrection.\n\nThen, in the middle of the twentieth century, the complete, unabridged, original Sumerian text of \"Inanna's Descent\" was finally translated, revealing that, instead of ending with Dumuzid's resurrection as had long been assumed, the text actually ended with Dumuzid's \"death\". The discovery of the \"Return of Dumuzid\" in 1963 briefly revived hopes that Dumuzid might once again be able to be categorized as a \"dying-and-rising god\", but the text ultimately proved disappointing in this regard because it does not describe a triumph over death (as would be necessary for a true Frazerian \"resurrection myth\") and instead does precisely the opposite and affirms the \"inalterable power of the realm of the dead\" by the fact that Dumuzid can only leave the Underworld when his sister takes his place.\n\nFrazer and others also saw Tammuz's Greek equivalent Adonis as a \"dying-and-rising god\", despite the fact that he is never described as rising from the dead in any extant Greco-Roman writings and the only possible allusions to his supposed resurrection come from late, highly ambiguous statements made by Christian authors. Attis is never described as being resurrected either; although many myths surround his death, none of them ever claim that he was resurrected. Osiris was never truly resurrected either; in Egyptian myth, Osiris's brother Set was said to have murdered him, chopped his body into pieces, and scattered them across the land. Osiris's devoted wife Isis collected his dismembered limbs and reassembled them, allowing her to revive Osiris in the Duat, the Egyptian afterlife, where he became the king of the dead.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, scholars began to severely criticize the designation of \"dying-and-rising god\" altogether. In 1987, Jonathan Z. Smith concluded in Mircea Eliade's \"Encyclopedia of Religion\" that \"The category of dying and rising gods, once a major topic of scholarly investigation, must now be understood to have been largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions and exceedingly late or highly ambiguous texts.\" He further argued that the deities previously referred to as \"dying-and-rising\" would be better termed separately as \"dying gods\" and \"disappearing gods\", asserting that before Christianity, the two categories were distinct and gods who \"died\" did not return, and those who returned never truly \"died\". By the end of the twentieth century, most scholars had come to agree that the notion of a \"dying-and-rising god\" was an invention and that the term was not a useful scholarly designation.\n\n\n"}

His younger brother was Arthur B. Spingarn. He graduated from Columbia College in 1895. He grew committed to the importance of the study of comparative literature as a discipline distinct from the study of English or any other language-based literary studies.\n\nPolitics was one of his lifetime passions. In 1908, as a Republican he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1912 and 1916, he was a delegate to the national convention of the Progressive Party. At the first of those conventions, he failed in his attempts to add a statement condemning racial discrimination to the party platform.\n\nHe served as professor of comparative literature at Columbia University from 1899 to 1911. His academic publishing established him as one of America's foremost comparativists. It included two editions of \"A History of Literary Criticism in the Renaissance\" in 1899 and 1908 as well as edited works like \"Critical Essays of the Seventeenth-Century\" in 3 volumes. He summarized his philosophy in \"The New Criticism: A Lecture Delivered at Columbia University, March 9, 1910\". There he argued against the constraints of such traditional categories as genre, theme, and historical setting in favor of viewing each work of art afresh and on its own terms.\n\nFrom 1904, his role in academic politics marked him as an independent spirit—too independent for the university's autocratic president Nicholas Murray Butler. His differences with the administration ranged from personality conflicts to educational philosophy. Things came to a head in 1910, when he offered a resolution at a university faculty meeting in support of Harry Thurston Peck, a Columbia professor who had been summarily dismissed by Butler because of a public scandal involving a breach-of-promise suit. That precipitated Spingarn's dismissal just five weeks later. He became part of a distinguished series of prominent academics who resigned or were dismissed during Butler's tenure as president, including George Edward Woodberry, Charles Beard, and James Harvey Robinson.\n\nWithout an academic appointment but of independent means, Spingarn continued to publish in his field much as he had before, writing, editing, and contributing to collections of essays. He was commissioned in the U.S. Army and served as a major during World War I. In 1919 he was a co-founder of the publishing firm of Harcourt, Brace and Company.\n\nHe also took up the other cause of his life, racial justice. An influential liberal Republican, he helped realize the concept of a unified black movement by joining the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) shortly after its founding and was one of the first Jewish leaders of that organization, serving as chairman of its board from 1913 to 1919, its treasurer from 1919 to 1930, its second president from 1930 until his death in 1939. In 1914 he established the Spingarn Medal, awarded annually by the NAACP for outstanding achievement by an African American. During World War I, according to an NAACP publication, he was instrumental in seeing that \"a training camp for Negro officers at Des Moines was established and about 1,000 Negro officers commissioned.\"\n\nAlways interested in gardening, in the years following 1920 he amassed the world's largest collection of clematis—250 species—and published the results of his research on the early history of landscape gardening and horticulture in Dutchess County, New York. He served as a member of the Board of Managers for the New York Botanical Garden.\n\nHe lived with his wife, Amy Einstein Spingarn, in Manhattan and at their country estate which later became the Troutbeck Inn and Conference Center in Amenia, New York. They had two sons, including Stephen J. Spingarn, and two daughters.\n\nHe died after a long illness on July 26, 1939. His will included a bequest to fund the Spingarn Medal in perpetuity.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Denny had gained a card license that year after making and selling other NFL memorabilia in previous years. His licensing agreement with NFL Properties allowed Denny to gain access to its extensive photo library and become the first card maker officially associated with a professional sports league. Across the bottom of most of his company's cards was its designation as \"The Official NFL Card,\" a distinction it held through 1991.\n\nThe first year that Pro Set released a product was 1989. The year marked the beginning of the modern era for pro football cards. Score (who had entered the market the year before with baseball) also released a football product. For several years, Pro Set flooded the market with its product. The company managed to produce football sets through 1993 and in 1994, but Pro Set folded, due to Chapter 7 bankruptcy, citing more than $800,000 in unpaid royalties to the NFLPA.\n\nPro Set made rookie cards of actual rookies (notably draft picks) and offered more color and action shots than Topps did. Pro Set claimed to have its own printing presses for its product, which could make and issue cards very quickly. For its first football card set in 1989, Pro Set released its cards in three series. The 1989 rookies were found primarily in the second series. Key rookies in the set included Troy Aikman, Barry Sanders, Derrick Thomas, Jeff Lageman and Deion Sanders. The 100 card Series II set was sold in packs, but the packs averaged 11 Series I cards and 4 Series II cards per pack. These cards not only featured first round picks but featured later round picks.

A free magazine was published by Pro Set called the Pro Set Gazette. It was mailed to 1.2 million collectors twice a year. Beckett Publications noted that in 1991, sports cards grossed about $1.9 billion in sales in North America, so Pro Set had a dramatic impact, albeit briefly.\n\nThere were a number of inserts in 1989 Pro Set football, including a 30 card subset of broadcasters. There were also Super Bowl insert cards for each game that had been played. There was also a card for NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle. Pro Set introduced an insert card for Santa Claus that was labelled as a coach card. The first year it was released was in 1989 and it was a dealer premium. It was inserted in packs in 1990 and 1991. The Santa Claus cards included Pro Set founder Ludwell Denny somewhere in the card. On the back of each Santa card is a parody of the poem \"The Night Before Christmas\" that has sportscard subject matter. Pro Set included other insert cards in its 1990 offering, such as Payne Stewart, a comic book character called Super Pro, which was a superhero in a football uniform, a tribute to the late Joe Robbie, and the Lombardi Trophy Hologram card.\n\nThe 1990 Pro Set football card release has several errors and variations. Due to a contractual dispute, and his unwillingness to join the NFPLA, the Pro Bowl card of Eric Dickerson (No. 338) was withdrawn early creating a short print. Card #338 would be reissued with Ludwell Denny on the front and it was a promotional card not available in packs. Card #75 in the set was meant to be Browns Center Cody Risien, but the card was withdrawn early due to his retirement during training camp, also resulting in a short print. The most sought after variation from 1990 Pro Set is card #204 Fred Marion of the New England Patriots. This card is rather controversial because the card features San Francisco 49ers player John Taylor in the background and the belt from Taylor's pants came undone. The positioning of the belt gives the appearance that his private area is exposed, but it is just a shadow and the belt.\n\n\nVarious cards in the 1990 offering have three variations. They are as follows:\n\n\nWhen Pro Set, Inc. entered Chapter Eleven bankruptcy protection prior to the 1992–93 NHL season, Price traveled weekly from Toronto to Dallas and became the unofficial hockey brand manager. The second year of Parkhurst (1992–93) was the last with Pro Set as the company went bankrupt and Price took his Parkhurst tradename and license to the Upper Deck Company, an agreement which began with the 1993–94 season.\n\nThe allegations were based on investments made by former NFL Properties presidents, John Flood, (who was dismissed in March 1994), and his predecessor, John Bello, who quit in September 1993. Neither Flood nor Bello told the league they had set up companies to invest in Pro-Set Press, a printer partly owned by the Pro Set trading card company.\n\n"}

{"id": "49128205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49128205", "title": "The Modern Cook", "text": "The Modern Cook\n\nThe Modern Cook was the first cookery book by the Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli (1805–1876). It was first published in 1846. It was popular for half a century in the Victorian era, running through 29 London editions by 1896. It was also published in America.\n\nThe book offered elaborate dishes, described with French terminology such as bisque, entrées, entremets, vol-au-vent, timbale and soufflé. It included bills of fare for meals for up to 300 people, and for a series of eight- or nine-course dinners served to Queen Victoria; one exceptional royal dinner in 1841 had sixteen entrées and sixteen entremets, including truffles in Champagne.\n\n\"The Modern Cook\" was the first to mention filling wafer cones with ice cream. The book, written for upper middle-class housewives, is illustrated with 60 engravings, often showing how to present carefully-decorated centrepiece dishes such as \"Salmon à la Chambord\" for large dinner parties.\n\nThe book influenced households in Britain and America to aspire to more complex, French-style dinners in imitation of the Queen, and resulted in a change in eating habits, including the modern two-course approach for both lunch and dinner.\n\nCharles Elmé Francatelli, from an Italian family, was born in London in 1805, and learnt cookery in France. Coming to England, he worked for various aristocrats before becoming chief chef of Crockford's club and then chief cook to Queen Victoria in 1840. He went on to work at Crockford's again, at the Coventry House and Reform Clubs, St James's Hotel, and for the Prince and Princess of Wales. This made him a celebrity cook of his time.\n\nApart from the preface and Francatelli's advice on serving wine, the body of the book consists almost entirely of recipes without any kind of introduction. There is no guidance on choice of kitchenware or advice on the layout of the kitchen.\n\nThe recipes are presented entirely as instructions, generally without illustration. Quantities, where stated, are incorporated in the text; ingredients are never listed explicitly. Quantities are sometimes named, as in the \"Cream Bechamel Sauce\", which begins \"Put six ounces of fresh butter into a middle-sized stewpan; add four ounces of sifted flour, some nutmeg, a few peppercorns, and a little salt;\". In other cases only the relative proportions are indicated, as for the \"Salmis of Partridges with Aspic Jelly\", where the only hint of quantity in the recipe is \"must be mixed with one-third of its quantity of aspic jelly\". This recipe also indicates the style of cross-referencing, with the starting instruction \"Prepare the salmis as directed in No. 1078\".\n\n\"The Modern Cook\" is the first published record in England of filling wafer cornets, which Francatelli called \"gauffres\", with ice cream. He used them to garnish his iced puddings.\n\nThe following apply to the 28th edition of 1886. The Table of Contents did not have page numbers.\n\nThe 28th edition is illustrated with 60, mostly small, engravings. There is a full-page frontispiece of the author, drawn by Auguste Hervieu and engraved by Samuel Freeman (1773–1857). Freeman is known for working mainly in stipple, and the portrait here is no exception.\n\nAll the other engravings are of completed dishes, showing the serving-plate with the food arranged on it and often elaborately garnished. The artists and engravers of the food illustrations are not identified.\n\nFrancatelli provides \"A Series of Bills of Fare for Every Month Throughout the Year\", including dinners variously for 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 16, 18, 20, 24, 28 and 36 persons (though not all of these in every month). The bills of fare for dinners for 6 persons thus represent the simplest menus in the book. All the dinners are divided into a first and a second \"Course\", but each course was divided in turn into three or four servings, in most cases with a choice of two or more dishes. Thus there might be one or two soups, two fishes, two \"removes\" of meat, and two savoury \"entrées\" in the first \"Course\", with a second \"Course\" of one kind of game, followed by a choice of three \"entremets\" which included both savouries, generally vegetables, and desserts.\n\nThere is a single bill of fare for a \"Ball Supper for 300 Persons\", and one for a \"Public Dinner\" for the same number.\n\nThere are 13 bills of fare for \"Her Majesty's Dinner\", each with an exact date in 1841 and the words \"(\"Under the control of C. Francatelli.\")\". Each of the royal dinners has either eight or nine courses (including a buffet or sideboard), except for that of 30 June which is divided into two \"Services\" and has 11 courses.\n\nThe royal dinners are described almost entirely in French, with the exception of the heading, the phrase \"Side Board\", and a few specifically British dishes such as \"Roast Mutton\" and \"Haunch of Venison\". There are usually two soups, two fishes, two removes, six entrées, two roasts, two more removes, six entremets, and between two and seven dishes on the sideboard. The exceptional royal dinner of 30 June 1841 had sixteen entrées and sixteen entremets. Some of these entremets used the most costly ingredients including truffles in Champagne.\n\n\"The Modern Cook\" was first published in 1846. It reached its 29th edition in 1896. Francatelli presented a copy of the 8th edition to Queen Victoria on 4 June 1853.\n\nEditions included:\n\n\"Kettner's Book of the Table\" of 1877, describing Francatelli as \"a type of all the great French cooks\", asserted that he \"gives a most elaborate recipe for aspic jelly; and he is so satisfied with it that, having to prepare a cold supper for 300 people, he works it up in every one of his 56 dishes which are neither sweet nor hot. The book further argues that \"this is the result of science—this the height of art. It produces, with such elaborate forms and majestic ceremonies, an aspic jelly without aspic, that, exhausted in the effort, it can proceed no further, and seems to think that here at last, in this supreme sauce, we have a sure resting-place—the true blessedness—the \"ewigkeit\".\"\n\nGeorge H. Ellwanger wrote in his \"Pleasures of the Table\" in 1902 that Francatelli's \"Modern Cook\" was \"still a superior treatise, and although little adapted to the average household, it will well repay careful study on the part of the expert amateur. 'The palate is as capable and nearly as worthy of education as the eye and the ear,' says Francatelli — a statement which his volume abundantly bears out.\" He added that \"one sees, accordingly, an ornate observance of decoration in his grand army of side-dishes. These are excellent throughout, but generally very elaborate, while his sauces and recipes for pastry are especially good. The same may be said of his quenelles and timbales. A competent hand will find his work a valuable guide from which to obtain ideas; it is not a practical book for the majority.\"\n\nThe \"New Zealand Herald\" of 1912 commented that Francatelli was \"an earnest and gifted worker in the cause of gastronomy\" and that \"The Modern Cook\" faithfully reflected Victorian dining habits. \"Everything was good and solid of its kind, even if tending towards complication rather than simplicity.\" The review opined that the great joints of meat \"decorated with their silver hatelet skewers bearing cock's combs and trufflets, were attended by the most appetizing ragouts and garnishes.\" Despite the gloss, there was \"nothing meretricious or deceptive in the savoury promises held out by Victorian comestibles.\" The reviewer notes, however, that even while Francatelli was describing this elaborate fare, the \"excessive meat-eating\" was being replaced by a diet richer in vegetables, and meals were becoming simpler, so that \"now, in the 20th century, much that Francatelli wrote about ... is no longer needed.\"\n\nM. F. K. Fisher, writing in \"The New York Times\", stated that millions of American women in the 19th century organised \"every aspect of their lives .. as much as possible in imitation of the Queen\", and that \"The Modern Cook\" sold almost as well in America as it did in England. Admitting that few American kitchens could \"follow all its directions for the light Gallic dainties Francatelli introduced to counteract the basic heaviness of royal dining habits\", she argued that all the same his two-course approach eventually shaped the way Americans now eat both lunch and dinner. She observed that at Windsor Castle, Francatelli and other royal chefs were assisted by 24 assistant chefs and two \"Yeomen of the Kitchen\", not to mention a multitude of \"servers and lackeys\". This did not deter American housewives \"as far west as Iowa and then beyond\" from doing their best to follow his instructions.\n\nThe \"Historic Food\" website notes that Francatelli provides two recipes for mincemeat, one with roast beef, the other containing lemons but no meat.\n\nC. Anne Wilson, introducing \"Women and Victorian Values, 1837-1910. Advice Books, Manuals and Journals for Women\", states that Francatelli was writing for the \"upper middle-class housewife\" in \"The Modern Cook\", explaining to her how to serve the \"socially important\" dinner in English, French and \"à la Russe\" styles. In contrast, his 1861 \"Cook's Guide\" is for \"more ordinary\" households, advocating \"traditional two-course dinners\".\n\nNick Baines writes on \"LoveFood\" that Francatelli included \"a whole collection of lavish pies\" in the book.\n\nPanikos Panayi, in his book \"Spicing Up Britain\", writes that Francatelli's book for the middle classes definitely recognised differences between British and foreign foods, even in its full title which ran \"\"...Comprising, in Addition to English Cookery, the Most Advanced and Recherché Systems of French, Italian and German Cookery\"\". Panayi notes that Francatelli's preface to the first edition was scathing about ignorant \"English writers on gastronomy\", comparing them unfavourably to the \"great Professors\" of cuisine in France. Panayi observes further that while most of Francatelli's chapters are not grouped by national origin, he does distinguish English, Foreign, and Italian soups. He notes that it would have taken years to eat all the dishes listed, and that it is impossible to tell how often middle-class families may have eaten \"fillets of haddocks, à la royale\". He considers it likely that only the wealthiest could have aspired to eat the sort of food described by Francatelli, but concedes that his bills of fare for dinners for six persons (by month) do indicate that the middle classes could afford the best meat and vegetables, and indeed that they had domestic staff able to prepare dinners of that complexity described in Francatelli's French terminology. Panayi concludes that Francatelli represents \"perhaps the most extreme example\" of the nineteenth century British habit of giving dishes French descriptions.\n"}
{"id": "90167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90167", "title": "The White Goddess", "text": "The White Goddess\n\nThe White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth is a book-length essay on the nature of poetic myth-making by author and poet Robert Graves. First published in 1948, the book is based on earlier articles published in \"Wales\" magazine, corrected, revised and enlarged editions appeared in 1948, 1952 and 1961. \"The White Goddess\" represents an approach to the study of mythology from a decidedly creative and idiosyncratic perspective. Graves proposes the existence of a European deity, the \"White Goddess of Birth, Love and Death\", much similar to the \"Mother Goddess\", inspired and represented by the phases of the moon, who lies behind the faces of the diverse goddesses of various European and pagan mythologies.\n\nGraves argues that \"true\" or \"pure\" poetry is inextricably linked with the ancient cult-ritual of his proposed White Goddess and of her son.\n\nMany of the book's themes are also explored in a fictional form, through his depiction of a future society dominated by Great Goddess religion in the 1949 novel \"Seven Days in New Crete\".\n\nGraves first wrote the book under the title of \"The Roebuck in the Thicket\" in a three-week period during January 1944, only a month after finishing \"The Golden Fleece\". He then left the book to focus on \"King Jesus,\" a historical novel about the life of Jesus. Returning to \"The Roebuck in the Thicket\", he renamed it \"The Three-Fold Muse\", before finishing it and retitling it as \"The White Goddess\". In January 1946 he sent it to the publishers, and in May 1948 it was published in the UK, and in June 1948 in the US, as \"The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth\".\n\nGraves described \"The White Goddess\" as \"a historical grammar of the language of poetic myth\". The book draws from the mythology and poetry of Wales and Ireland especially, as well as that of most of Western Europe and the ancient Middle East. Relying on arguments from etymology and the use of forensic techniques to uncover what he calls 'iconotropic' redaction of original myths, Graves argues for the worship of a single goddess under many names, an idea that came to be known as \"Matriarchal religion\" in feminist theology of the 1970s.\n\n\"The Golden Bough\" (1922, but first edition published 1890), an early anthropological study by Sir James George Frazer, is the starting point for much of Graves's argument, and Graves thought in part that his book made explicit what Frazer only hinted at. Graves wrote: \nSir James Frazer was able to keep his beautiful rooms at Trinity College, Cambridge until his death by carefully and methodically sailing all around his dangerous subject, as if charting the coastline of a forbidden island without actually committing himself to a declaration that it existed. What he was saying-not-saying was that Christian legend, dogma and ritual are the refinement of a great body of primitive and even barbarous beliefs, and that almost the only original element in Christianity is the personality of Jesus.\n\nGraves's \"The White Goddess\" deals with goddess worship as the prototypical religion, analysing it largely from literary evidence, in myth and poetry.\n\nGraves admitted he was not a medieval historian, but a poet, and thus based his work on the premise that the\nlanguage of poetic myth anciently current in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe was a magical language bound up with popular religious ceremonies in honour of the Moon-goddess, or Muse, some of them dating from the Old Stone Age, and that this remains the language of true poetry...\nGraves concluded, in the second and expanded edition, that the male-dominant monotheistic god of Judaism and its successors were the cause of the White Goddess's downfall, and thus the source of much of the modern world's woe. He describes Woman as occupying a higher echelon than mere poet, that of the Muse Herself. He adds \"This is not to say that a woman should refrain from writing poems; only, that she should write as a woman, not as an honorary man.\" He seems particularly bothered by the spectre of women's writing reflecting male-dominated poetic conventions.\n\nGraves derived some of his ideas from poetic inspiration and a process of \"analeptic thought\", which is a term he used for throwing one's mind back in time and receiving impressions.\n\nVisual iconography was also important to Graves's conception. Graves created a methodology for reading images he called \"iconotropy\". To practice this methodology one is required to reduce \"speech into its original images and rhythms\" and then to combine these \"on several simultaneous levels of thought\". By applying this methodology Graves decoded a woodcut of \"The Judgement of Paris\" as depicting a singular Triple Goddess rather than the traditional Hera, Athena and Aphrodite of the narrative the image illustrates.\n\nGraves also argues that the names of the Ogham letters in the alphabet used in parts of Gaelic Ireland and Britain contained a calendar that contained the key to an ancient liturgy involving the human sacrifice of a sacred king, and, further, that these letter names concealed lines of Ancient Greek hexameter describing the goddess.\n\nGraves' \"Tree Calendar\" has no relation to any historical Celtic calendar.\nHis interpretations rather rely on the book \"Ogygia\" by the 17th-century bard Roderick O'Flaherty.\n\nIn \"The White Goddess\", Graves proposed a hypothetical Gallic tree goddess, Druantia, who has become somewhat popular with contemporary Neopagans. Druantia is an archetype of the eternal mother as seen in the evergreen boughs. Her name is believed to be derived from the Celtic word for oak trees, * or *. She is known as \"Queen of the Druids\". She is a goddess of fertility for both plants & humans, ruling over sexual activities & passion. She also rules protection of trees, knowledge, creativity.\n\n\"The White Goddess\" has been seen as a poetic work where Graves gives his notion of man's subjection to women in love an \"anthropological grandeur\" and further mythologises all women in general (and several of Graves's lovers in specific) into a three-faced moon goddess model. \nGraves's value as a poet aside, flaws in his scholarship such as poor philology, use of inadequate texts and outdated archaeology have been criticised. Some scholars, particularly archaeologists, historians and folklorists have rejected the work – which T. S. Eliot called \"A prodigious, monstrous, stupefying, indescribable book\" – and Graves himself was disappointed that his work was \"loudly ignored\" by many Celtic scholars.\n\nHowever, \"The White Goddess\" was accepted as history by many non-scholarly readers. According to Ronald Hutton, the book \"remains a major source of confusion about the ancient Celts and influences many un-scholarly views of Celtic paganism\". Hilda Ellis Davidson criticised Graves as having \"misled many innocent readers with his eloquent but deceptive statements about a nebulous goddess in early Celtic literature\", and stated that he was \"no authority\" on the subject matter he presented. While Graves made the association between Goddesses and the moon appear \"natural\", it was not so to the Celts or some other ancient peoples. In response to critics, Graves accused literary scholars of being psychologically incapable of interpreting myth or too concerned with maintaining their perquisites to go against the majority view. (See Frazer quote.)\n\nSome Neopagans have been bemused and upset by the scholarly criticism that \"The White Goddess\" has received in recent years, while others have appreciated its poetic insight but never accepted it as a work of historical veracity. Likewise, a few scholars find some value in Graves' ideas; Michael W. Pharand, though quoting earlier criticisms, rebutted, \"Graves's theories and conclusions, outlandish as they seemed to his contemporaries (or may appear to us), were the result of careful observation.\"\n\nAccording to Graves' biographer Richard Perceval Graves, Laura Riding played a crucial role in the development of Graves' thoughts when writing \"The White Goddess\", despite the fact the two were estranged at that point. On reviewing the book, Riding was furious, saying \"Where once I reigned, now a whorish abomination has sprung to life, a Frankenstein pieced together from the shards of my life and thoughts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The master plan was created by Surbana in cooperation with local experts. The plan hopes to create a Megacity that can match other economic hubs such as Dubai, Singapore, Seoul and Tokyo and solve the issues of traffic congestion, garbage, slums, and environmental pollution. The main goals of the project are for economic growth and prosperity, good governance, creation of an efficient and well-planned region, social equity and harmony as well as environmental sustainability. The project includes Social Infrastructure development such as housing, healthcare, education ,spiritual development, Safety and security, Transportation and traffic Management, Airports and port development, Water and Energy related infrastructure development as well as the development of SMEs, Industries and tourism.\n\nThe conceptual plan was initially mooted in 1991 by the then young Sri Lankan Industries, Science and Technology Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, when he made a presentation in the presence of the visiting Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, with the objective of getting Japanese assistance to implement the Megaproject. However development of the concept came to a halt with the change of the government in 1994. In 2004 Singaporean HDB's design subsidiary CESMA created the Western Region Megapolis plan when Wickremasinghe returned to power and the proposal was submitted to the Board of Investment(BOI) however the fall of the government again stopped the project. His successor Mahinda Rajapaksa abandoned the plan but implemented piecemeal recommendations of the project.\n\nAfter returning to power in 2015, Wickremasinghe requested Surbana Jurong, the successor of CESMA to revise the plan to suit the newer needs. The Megapolis plan was unveiled in a ceremony with Prime Minister Wickremesighe, President Maithripala Sirisena and Megapolis and Western province development minister Champika Ranawaka. in 2016 Siemens signed an MoU with the Ministry of Megapolis to provide solutions for smart cities.\n\nThe megapolis project has several proposals for transport development. Plans include a modernized bus service, an electrified railway system, modern Rapid Transit System (RTS) and an inland water transport system for a new boat/ferry service that uses Colombo’s historic canal network, a new urban expressway system, and improvements to existing roadways. Transport-related related projects identified by the Master plan of Western Region Megapolis Planning Project are implemented under the Transport Development Project (TBD)\n\nA new rail-based Rapid Transit System will be introduced in the Greater Colombo area. Bus, taxi and school transport systems in the region will be restructured and modernized. Bus stations and terminals will be upgraded. A transport information and analysis centre is proposed in the project master plan.\n\nThe plan further proposes,\n\nBus\n\nThe plan proposes to revise the route network to enhance efficiency and convenience, reform and restructure public bus service and institutions, initiate express bus services using intercity expressways, deploy smart bus service with low floor kneeling, air conditioning, and on-board IT and improve facilities at suburban bus terminals and stands.\n\nRail\nUpgrading stations, rail tracks and signaling, communication and ticketing systems, introduction of new rolling stock are proposed. Electrification of existing lines and several new lines are also proposed in the project. The main lines to be modernized and electrified are,\nthe first three lines already exist while the last two are proposed to be added to the net work in the future. The feasibility study on the Panadura–Veyangoda line has been proposed under the Colombo Suburban Railway Project under ADB assistance and as of April 2016 the Ministry of Transport has commenced shortlisting the consultants for the feasibility study.\n\nLight Rail\nA Light Rail Transit (LRT) system serving the designated Western Region Megapolis area within the Colombo District, Sri Lanka. The project will consist of seven elevated and surface-level tracks to cover the main public institutions in the city and the sububrs. Japan International Cooperation Agency agreed to fund the project and is assisting in the feasibility study. As of early 2017 Expressions of Interests for consulting services for feasibility studies have been called. And in November 2017, the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development signed with a South Korean company, Seoyoung Engineering, to begin feasibility study of the project, and the planned construction in Colombo and its suburbs is to commence in late 2018.\n\nThe project is to be carried out in seven phases, the first phase would see the Light Rail system running from Malabe to Fort, with all seven phases covering a total distance of 75km. The seven phases are listed below:\n\n\nWaterways\n\nThere will be new boat services to enhance west-west connectivity as well as to promote eco-tourism during night hours. Three main routes have been identified which are,\nIt is proposed to be launched as an public-private partnership. A boat service between Battaramulla and Nawala began in December 2016.\n\nExpanding and extending existing key roadways and improving existing urban roads and intersections as well as building elevated roadways from New Kelani Bridge to Colombo Fort area, the Port and Battaramulla Flyovers are also being built as an interim solution for traffic congestion.\n\nThe plan proposes the expnasion and modernization of the Sapugaskanda oil refinary, new natural Gas power plants and conversion of existing petroleum based power plants to natural gas and conversion of overhead voltage lines to underground insulated cables, exploration of natural gas reserves in Mannar, development of clean energy such as Solar and Wind power as well as waste-to-energy power plants.\n\nThe project is divided into 11 planning areas in terms of geography and economic potential. Each with its own zoning rules and regulations,\n\n1. Aero City Zone: Katunayake\n\nThe Aero City, will involve development of airport infrastructure including upgdrading the Aerodrome of the Colombo International Airport, New Passenger Terminal, Aero-City BusinessPark, Airport Hotel an International Convention Centre, a second runway the BIA and the development of an Aero-City Residential Township in Minuwangoda\n\n2.
