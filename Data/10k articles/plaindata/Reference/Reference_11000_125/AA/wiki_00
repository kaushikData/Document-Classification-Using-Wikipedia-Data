{"id": "18950713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18950713", "title": "Alternative dispute resolution", "text": "Alternative dispute resolution\n\nAlternative dispute resolution (ADR; known in some countries, such as India, as external dispute resolution) includes dispute resolution processes and techniques that act as a means for disagreeing parties to come to an agreement short of litigation. It is a collective term for the ways that parties can settle disputes, with the help of a third party.\n\nDespite historic resistance to ADR by many popular parties and their advocates, ADR has gained widespread acceptance among both the general public and the legal profession in recent years. In fact, some courts now require some parties to resort to ADR of some type, usually mediation, before permitting the parties' cases to be tried (indeed the European Mediation Directive (2008) expressly contemplates so-called \"compulsory\" mediation; this means that attendance is compulsory, not that settlement must be reached through mediation). Additionally, parties to merger and acquisition transactions are increasingly turning to ADR to resolve post-acquisition disputes.\n\nThe rising popularity of ADR can be explained by the increasing caseload of traditional courts, the perception that ADR imposes fewer costs than litigation, a preference for confidentiality, and the desire of some parties to have greater control over the selection of the individual or individuals who will decide their dispute. Some of the senior judiciary in certain jurisdictions (of which England and Wales is one) are strongly in favour of this (ADR) use of mediation to settle disputes.\n\nAlternative dispute resolution (ADR) is generally classified into at least four types: negotiation, mediation, collaborative law, and arbitration. Sometimes, conciliation is included as a fifth category, but for simplicity may be regarded as a form of mediation. ADR can be used alongside existing legal systems such as Sharia courts within common law jurisdictions, such as the UK.\n\nADR traditions vary somewhat by country and culture. There are significant common elements which justify a main topic, and each country or region's difference should be delegated to sub-pages.\n\nADR is of two historic types. First, methods for resolving disputes outside of the official judicial mechanisms. Second, informal methods attached to or pendant to official judicial mechanisms. There are in addition free-standing and or independent methods, such as mediation programs and ombuds offices within organizations. The methods are similar, whether or not they are pendant, and generally use similar tool or skill sets, which are basically sub-sets of the skills of negotiation.\n\nADR includes informal tribunals, informal mediative processes, formal tribunals and formal mediative processes. The classic formal tribunal forms of ADR are arbitration (both binding and advisory or non-binding) and private judges (either sitting alone, on panels or over summary jury trials). The classic formal mediative process is referral for mediation before a court-appointed mediator or mediation panel. Structured transformative mediation as used by the U.S. Postal Service is a formal process. Classic informal methods include social processes, referrals to non-formal authorities (such as a respected member of a trade or social group) and intercession. The major differences between formal and informal processes are (a) pendency to a court procedure and (b) the possession or lack of a formal structure for the application of the procedure.\n\nFor example, freeform negotiation is merely the use of the tools without any process. Negotiation within a labor arbitration setting is the use of the tools within a highly formalized and controlled setting.\n\nCalling upon an organizational ombudsman's office is never, by itself, a formal procedure. (Calling upon an organizational ombudsman is always voluntary; by the International Ombudsman Association Standards of Practice, no one can be compelled to use an ombuds office.)\n\nOrganizational ombuds offices refer people to all conflict management options in the organization: formal and informal, rights-based and interest-based. But, in addition, in part because they have no decision-making authority, ombuds offices can, themselves, offer a wide spectrum of informal options.\n\nThis spectrum is often overlooked in contemporary discussions of \"ADR\". \"ADR\" often refers to external conflict management options that are important, but used only occasionally. An organizational ombuds office typically offers many internal options that are used in hundreds of cases a year. These options include:\n\n\nInformal referral to a co-worker known to help people work out issues is an informal procedure. Co-worker interventions are usually informal.\n\nConceptualizing ADR in this way makes it easy to avoid confusing tools and methods (does negotiation once a lawsuit is filed cease to be ADR? If it is a tool, then the question is the wrong question) (is mediation ADR unless a court orders it? If you look at court orders and similar things as formalism, then the answer is clear: court annexed mediation is merely a formal ADR process).\n\nDividing lines in ADR processes are often provider driven rather than consumer driven. Educated consumers will often choose to use many different options depending on the needs and circumstances that they face.\n\nFinally, it is important to realize that conflict resolution is one major goal of all the ADR processes. If a process leads to resolution, it is a dispute resolution process.\n\nThe salient features of each type are as follows:\n\n\nBeyond the basic types of alternative dispute resolutions there are other different forms of ADR:\n\nAn organizational ombudsman works within the institution to look into complaints independently and impartially.\n\n\"Alternative\" dispute resolution is usually considered to be alternative to litigation. It also can be used as a colloquialism for allowing a dispute to drop or as an alternative to violence.\n\nIn recent years there has been more discussion about taking a systems approach in order to offer different kinds of options to people who are in conflict, and to foster \"appropriate\" dispute resolution.\n\nThat is, some cases and some complaints in fact ought to go to formal grievance or to court or to the police or to a compliance officer or to a government IG. Other conflicts could be settled by the parties if they had enough support and coaching, and yet other cases need mediation or arbitration. Thus \"alternative\" dispute resolution usually means a method that is not the courts. \"Appropriate\" dispute resolution considers all the possible responsible options for conflict resolution that are relevant for a given issue.\n\nADR can increasingly be conducted online, which is known as online dispute resolution (ODR, which is mostly a buzzword and an attempt to create a distinctive product). It should be noted, however, that ODR services can be provided by government entities, and as such may form part of the litigation process. Moreover, they can be provided on a global scale, where no effective domestic remedies are available to disputing parties, as in the case of the UDRP and domain name disputes. In this respect, ODR might not satisfy the \"alternative\" element of ADR.\n\nADR has several advantages over litigation:\n\n\nHowever, ADR less suitable than litigation when there is:\n\nTraditional people's mediation has always involved the parties remaining in contact for most or all of the mediation session. The innovation of separating the parties after (or sometimes before) a joint session and conducting the rest of the process without the parties in the same area was a major innovation and one that dramatically improved mediation's success rate.\n\nTraditional arbitration involved heads of trade guilds or other dominant authorities settling disputes. The modern innovation was to have commercial vendors of arbitrators, often ones with little or no social or political dominance over the parties. The advantage was that such persons are much more readily available. The disadvantage is that it does not involve the community of the parties. When wool contract arbitration was conducted by senior guild officials, the arbitrator combined a seasoned expert on the subject matter with a socially dominant individual whose patronage, good will and opinion were important.\n\nPrivate judges and summary jury trials are cost- and time-saving processes that have had limited penetration due to the alternatives becoming more robust and accepted.\n\nSomalia has a cultural and historic mediation and justice system known as ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution), which is an informal justice system. It is a kind of justice system in which the arbiter listens to both sides of dispute and then concludes a solution that both sides will accept.\n\nLatin has a number of terms for mediator that predate the Roman Empire. Any time there are formal adjudicative processes it appears that there are informal ones as well. It is probably fruitless to attempt to determine which group had mediation first.\n\nNjáls saga is an Icelandic story of a mediator who was so successful that he eventually threatened the local power structure. It ends in tragedy with the unlawful burning of Njal alive in his home, the escape of a friend of the family, a mini-war and the eventual ending of the dispute by the intermarriage of the two strongest survivors. It illustrates that mediation was a powerful process in Iceland.\n\nAlternative dispute resolution in India is not new and it was in existence even under the previous Arbitration Act, 1940. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has been enacted to accommodate the harmonisation mandates of UNCITRAL Model. To streamline the Indian legal system the traditional civil law known as Code of Civil Procedure, (CPC) 1908 has also been amended and section 89 has been introduced. Section 89 (1) of CPC provides an option for the settlement of disputes outside the court. It provides that where it appears to the court that there exist elements, which may be acceptable to the parties, the court may formulate the terms of a possible settlement and refer the same for arbitration, conciliation, mediation or judicial settlement.\n\nDue to extremely slow judicial process, there has been a big thrust on Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanisms in India. While Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is a fairly standard western approach towards ADR, the Lok Adalat system constituted under National Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 is a uniquely Indian approach.\n\nA study on commercial dispute resolution in south India has been done by a think tank organization based in Kochi, Centre for Public Policy Research. The study reveals that the Court-annexed Mediation Centre in Bangalore has a success rate of 64%, and its counterpart in Kerala has an average success rate of 27.7%. Further, amongst the three southern states (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala), Tamil Nadu is said to have the highest adoption of dispute resolution, Kerala the least.\n\nPart I of this act formalizes the process of Arbitration and Part III formalizes the process of Conciliation. (Part II is about Enforcement of Foreign Awards under New York and Geneva Conventions.)\n\nThe process of arbitration can start only if there exists a valid Arbitration Agreement between the parties prior to the emergence of the dispute. As per Section 7, such an agreement must be in writing. The contract regarding which the dispute exists, must either contain an arbitration clause or must refer to a separate document signed by the parties containing the arbitration agreement. The existence of an arbitration agreement can also be inferred by written correspondence such as letters, telex, or telegrams which provide a record of the agreement. An exchange of statement of claim and defense in which existence of an arbitration agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by other is also considered as valid written arbitration agreement.\n\nAny party to the dispute can start the process of appointing arbitrator and if the other party does not cooperate, the party can approach the office of Chief Justice for appointment of an arbitrator. There are only two grounds upon which a party can challenge the appointment of an arbitrator – reasonable doubt in the impartiality of the arbitrator and the lack of proper qualification of the arbitrator as required by the arbitration agreement. A sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators so appointed constitute the Arbitration Tribunal.\n\nExcept for some interim measures, there is very little scope for judicial intervention in the arbitration process. The arbitration tribunal has jurisdiction over its own jurisdiction. Thus, if a party wants to challenge the jurisdiction of the arbitration tribunal, it can do so only before the tribunal itself. If the tribunal rejects the request, there is little the party can do except to approach a court after the tribunal makes an award. Section 34 provides certain grounds upon which a party can appeal to the principal civil court of original jurisdiction for setting aside the award.\n\nThe period for filing an appeal for setting aside an award is over, or if such an appeal is rejected, the award is binding on the parties and is considered as a decree of the court.\n\nConciliation is a less formal form of arbitration. This process does not require an existence of any prior agreement. Any party can request the other party to appoint a conciliator. One conciliator is preferred but two or three are also allowed. In case of multiple conciliators, all must act jointly. If a party rejects an offer to conciliate, there can be no conciliation.\n\nParties may submit statements to the conciliator describing the general nature of the dispute and the points at issue. Each party sends a copy of the statement to the other. The conciliator may request further details, may ask to meet the parties, or communicate with the parties orally or in writing. Parties may even submit suggestions for the settlement of the dispute to the conciliator.\n\nWhen it appears to the conciliator that elements of settlement exist, he may draw up the terms of settlement and send it to the parties for their acceptance. If both the parties sign the settlement document, it shall be final and binding on both.\n\nNote that in the US, this process is similar to mediation. However, in India, mediation is different from conciliation and is a completely informal type of ADR mechanism.\n\nEtymologically, Lok Adalat means \"people's court\". India has had a long history of resolving disputes through the mediation of village elders. The current system of Lok Adalats is an improvement on that and is based on Gandhian principles. This is a non-adversarial system, whereby mock courts (called Lok Adalats) are held by the State Authority, District Authority, Supreme Court Legal Services Committee, High Court Legal Services Committee, or Taluk Legal Services Committee, periodically for exercising such jurisdiction as they thinks fit. These are usually presided by retired judge, social activists, or members of legal profession. It does not have jurisdiction on matters related to non-compoundable offences.\n\nWhile in regular suits, the plaintiff is required to pay the prescribed court fee, in Lok Adalat, there is no court fee and no rigid procedural requirement (i.e. no need to follow process given by [Indian] Civil Procedure Code or Indian Evidence Act), which makes the process very fast. Parties can directly interact with the judge, which is not possible in regular courts.\n\nCases that are pending in regular courts can be transferred to a Lok Adalat if both the parties agree. A case can also be transferred to a Lok Adalat if one party applies to the court and the court sees some chance of settlement after giving an opportunity of being heard to the other party.\n\nThe focus in Lok Adalats is on compromise. When no compromise is reached, the matter goes back to the court. However, if a compromise is reached, an award is made and is binding on the parties. It is enforced as a decree of a civil court. An important aspect is that the award is final and cannot be appealed, not even under Article 226 of the Constitution of India [which empowers the litigants to file Writ Petition before High Courts] because it is a judgement by consent.\n\nAll proceedings of a Lok Adalat are deemed to be judicial proceedings and every Lok Adalat is deemed to be a Civil Court.\n\nIn order to get over the major drawback in the existing scheme of organisation of Lok Adalats under Chapter VI of the Legal Services Authorities Act 1987, in which if the parties do not arrive at any compromise or settlement, the unsettled case is either returned to the back to the court or the parties are advised to seek remedy in a court of law, which causes unnecessary delay in dispensation of justice, Chapter VI A was introduced in the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, by Act No.37/2002 with effect from 11-06-2002 providing for a Permanent Lok Adalat to deal with pre-litigation, conciliation and settlement of disputes relating to Public Utility Services, as defined u/sec.22 A of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, at pre-litigation stage itself, which would result in reducing the work load of the regular courts to a great extent. Permanent Lok Adalat for Public Utility Services, Hyderabad, India\n\nThe Lok Adalat is presided over by a sitting or retired judicial officer as the chairman, with two other members, usually a lawyer and a social worker. There is no court fee. If the case is already filed in the regular court, the fee paid will be refunded if the dispute is settled at the Lok Adalat. The procedural laws, and the Evidence Act are not strictly followed while assessing the merits of the claim by the Lok Adalat.\n\nMain condition of the Lok Adalat is that both parties in dispute should agree for settlement. The decision of the Lok Adalat is binding on the parties to the dispute and its order is capable of execution through legal process. No appeal lies against the order of the Lok Adalat.\n\nLok Adalat is very effective in settlement of money claims. Disputes like partition suits, damages and matrimonial cases can also be easily settled before Lok Adalat as the scope for compromise through an approach of give and take is high in these cases.\n\nLok Adalat is a boon to the litigant public, where they can get their disputes settled fast and free of cost.\n\nThe relevant laws (or parlour provisions) dealing with the ADR are summarised as under:\n\n13.Alternative Dispute Resolution Act. 2017\n\nBefore modern state law was introduced under colonialism, African customary legal systems mainly relied on mediation and conciliation. In many countries, these traditional mechanisms have been integrated into the official legal system. In Benin, specialised \"tribunaux de conciliation\" hear cases on a broad range of civil law matters. Results are then transmitted to the court of first instance where either a successful conciliation is confirmed or jurisdiction is assumed by the higher court. Similar tribunals also operate, in varying modes, in other francophone African countries.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, ADR is encouraged as a mean of resolving taxpayers' disputes with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.\n\nIn the regulated sectors, finance, telecoms and energy ADR providers exist. Outside of the regulated areas there are schemes in many sectors which provide schemes for voluntary membership. Two sets of regulations, in March and June 2015, were laid in Parliament to implement the European Directive on alternative dispute resolution in the UK.\n\nSECNAVINST 5800.13A established the DON ADR Program Office with the following missions:\n\n\nThe ADR Office also serves as the point of contact for questions regarding the use of ADR. The Assistant General Counsel (ADR) serves as the \"Dispute Resolution Specialist\" for the DON, as required by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996. Members of the office represent the DON’s interests on a variety of DoD and interagency working groups that promote the use of ADR within the Federal Government.\n\nCardozo School of Law's Kukin Program for Conflict Resolution is the seventh ranked alternative dispute resolution program in the country. The program includes: courses in negotiation, mediation, arbitration and dispute resolution processes; out-of-the-classroom-applied learning and scholarship in Cardozo’s Mediation Clinic and Securities Arbitration Clinic; the Cardozo Journal of Conflict Resolution, a student-run triannual publication; the Cardozo Dispute Resolution Society; and a Certificate in Dispute Resolution, awarded to J.D. students who complete coursework, writing and service requirements. LL.M. students can also receive an LL.M. in Dispute Resolution and Advocacy.\n\nCornell's ILR School has joined forces with Cornell's Law School to present the country's most comprehensive conflict resolution program focusing on workplace alternative dispute resolution (ADR). The Martin and Laurie Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution mission is to educate the next generation of neutrals – arbitrators, mediators and facilitators – who can help resolve disputes between employers and employees, both unionized and non-unionized. The Institute provides training for undergraduate and graduate students, consultation and evaluation, and conducts research. It also offers courses in two- to five-day sessions designed for professionals who are interested in or practicing in the workplace dispute resolution field. These highly intensive and participatory courses are coordinated by Cornell ILR faculty and are held in the ILR School's conference center in Manhattan and on the Ithaca campus. Participants can earn two certificates, Workplace Alternative Dispute Resolution and Conflict Management and Labor Arbitration.\n\nFordham Law School’s Dispute Resolution program placed in the top 10 of \"U.S. News & World Report\"'s 2008 rankings of the best Dispute Resolution programs in the nation, according to the recently released rankings. Along with Fordham's Clinical Training program, the Dispute Resolution program is the top-ranked specialty program at Fordham Law School. The Alternative Dispute Resolution program at Fordham combines an integrated agenda of teaching, scholarship, and practice in conflict resolution within the national and international communities. In addition to the classroom and clinical experience, the law school's student-run Dispute Resolution Society competes in ABA-sponsored interschool competitions as well as international mediation and arbitration competitions. In 2008 the Society's teams won the ABA Regional Negotiation Competition, placed third overall in the International Chamber of Commerce Commercial Mediation Competition in Paris, and reached the semifinals of the Willem C. Vis (East) International Commercial Arbitration Competition in Hong Kong. Additionally, Fordham's Dispute Resolution Society hosts an annual symposium on current Dispute Resolution topics and also teaches a class on dispute resolution skills to seniors at the Martin Luther King, Jr. High School in New York City.\n\n\"The [Harvard] Program on Negotiation (PON) is a university consortium dedicated to developing the theory and practice of negotiation and dispute resolution. As a community of scholars and practitioners, PON serves a unique role in the world negotiation community. Founded in 1983 as a special research project at Harvard Law School, PON includes faculty, students, and staff from Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tufts University.\" Harvard currently offers 12-week courses on negotiation and mediation for participants from all disciplines and professions as well as weekend seminars taught by their professors. The Harvard PON program is currently ranked #3 falling from #2 last year according to the U.S. World and News Report, and has also remained among the top 10 schools over the last decade.\n\nPepperdine University School of Law’s Straus Institute for Dispute Resolution provides professional training and academic programs in dispute resolution including a Certificate, Masters in Dispute Resolution (MDR) and Masters of Law in Dispute Resolution (LLM). Straus provides education to law and graduate students, as well as mid-career professionals in areas of mediation, negotiation, arbitration, international dispute resolution and peacemaking. The Straus Institute is ranked the number one dispute resolution school in the nation by US News and World Report.\n\nThe City University of New York Dispute Resolution Consortium (CUNY DRC) serves as an intellectual home to dispute-resolution faculty, staff and students at the City University of New York and to the diverse dispute-resolution community in New York City. At the United States' largest urban university system, the CUNY DRC has become a focal point for furthering academic and applied conflict resolution work in one of the world's most diverse cities. The CUNY DRC conducts research and innovative program development, has co-organized countless conferences, sponsored training programs, resolved a wide range of intractable conflicts, published research working papers and a newsletter. It also maintains an extensive database of those interested in dispute resolution in New York City, a website with resources for dispute resolvers in New York City and since 9/11, the CUNY DRC assumed a leadership role for dispute-resolvers in New York City by establishing an extensive electronic mailing list, sponsoring monthly breakfast meetings, conducting research on responses to catastrophes, and managing a public awareness initiative to further the work of dispute resolvers.\n\nThe International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution, known as the CPR Institute, is a New York City membership-based nonprofit organization that \"promotes excellence and innovation in public and private dispute resolution\". To this end, it serves as a \"primary multinational resource for avoidance, management, and resolution of business-related disputes\".\n\nThe CPR Institute was founded in 1979 as the Center for Public Resources by a coalition of leading corporate general counsel dedicated to identifying and applying appropriate alternative solutions to business disputes, thereby mitigating the extraordinary costs of lengthy court trials. Today, the CPR Institute is a nonprofit educational corporation existing under the New York state laws, and is tax exempt pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. It is governed by a board of directors, and its priorities and policies are guided in large part by consultation with an executive advisory committee. Its funding is primarily derived from the annual contributions of its member organizations, and from its mission-related programming. The various operations and activities that fulfill the Institute’s mission are captured in the acronym of its name:\n\nEstablished at George Mason as an alternative to a sociology program due to Virginia's then policy against duplicating graduate schools, it was the nation's first major dispute resolution graduate program. It has been a major success.\n\n\n\n"}

In recent years a consensus has emerged that the annalist was a woman. The annals are mostly dedicated to the history of the Holy Roman Empire; they also contain the first written mention of the name of Lithuania (\"Litua\"), dated to March, 1009. The original document has disappeared, surviving only as a 16th-century copy held in Dresden, but its contents endure as a scholarly resource.\n\nThe city of Quedlinburg, Germany, was first mentioned in writing in a document dated to 922. Saint Mathilda founded a religious community for women at its abbey, serving as abbess from 966 to 999. The abbey became a premier educational institution for the female nobles of Saxony, and maintained its mission for nearly 900 years. The city served as an imperial palatinate of the Saxon emperors, where Henry the Fowler, the founder of the Ottonian dynasty, was buried. Quedlinburg was situated not far from Magdeburg, the Royal Assembly of the empire, and its annalists could therefore rely on genuine information from the royal house and obtain eyewitness accounts. The city lost some stature under the rule of Henry II, who broke with the tradition of celebrating Easter there; the Annals portray him unfavorably, and demonstrate the extent to which a royal monastery was entitled to criticize its monarch.\n\nThe Annals open with a chronicle of world history from the time of Adam to the Third Council of Constantinople in 680-681, based on chronicles by Jerome, Isidore, and Bede. The narrative is largely borrowed from multiple older sources until the year 1002, although original reports from as early as 852 are present. Beginning in 993, the narrative begins including events which represent the annalist's own eyewitness testimony concerning events at and around Quedlinburg. The amount of detail increases significantly from 1008 onwards, leading some analysts to conclude that 1008 was the actual date that the Annals were first compiled, although Robert Holzman argues for a start date of 1000. It has been suggested that the annalist temporarily abandoned the project between 1016 and 1021. The exact reasons for this suspension of the work are unknown. Work on the project continued between 1021 and 1030, when its authors were able to report a military victory against Mieszko II.\n\nThe primary task of the annalists was to record the heritage of the Ottonian dynasty and of Quedlinburg itself. The Annals incorporate the stories of a number of historic and legendary figures such as Attila the Hun, King Dietrich of the Goths, and others. The historian Felice Lifshitz has suggested that the amount of saga material integrated into its narrative is without parallel.\n\nThe Annals of Quedlinburg became an important research source; during the 12th century they were used by at least five contemporary historians. Felice Lifshitz asserts that the Annals of Quedlinburg played a key role in shaping the ways in which influential Germans of the 19th and 20th centuries saw their medieval past. They continue to be analyzed in other contexts: by scholars of \"Beowulf\" discussing its use of the term \"Hugones\" to mean Franks, by climatologists, and in a book discussing fear of the millennium.\n\nThe first written occurrence of Lithuania's name has been traced to the Quedlinburg Annals and dated to 9 March 1009. The passage reads:\nFrom other sources that describe Bruno of Querfurt, it is clear that this missionary attempted to Christianize the pagan king Netimer and his subjects. However, Netimer's brother, refusing to accept Christianity, killed Bruno and his followers. The historian Alfredas Bumblauskas has suggested that the story records the first baptismal attempt in the history of Lithuania.\n\nThe Annals of the Holy Roman Empire. The Annals of Quedlinburg.

In order to report that information efficiently, numerous abbreviations have grown to be common in the sport.\n\nStarting in 1948 by Bert Nelson and Cordner Nelson, \"Track and Field News\" became the leader in creating and defining abbreviations in this field. But these abbreviations have also been adopted by, among others, the IAAF; the world governing body, various domestic governing bodies, the Association of Track and Field Statisticians, the Association of Road Racing Statisticians, the Associated Press and the individual media outlets who receive their reports. These abbreviations also appear in Wikipedia.\n\nAlmost all races record a time. Evolving since experiments in the 1930s, to their official use at the 1968 Summer Olympics and official acceptance in 1977, fully automatic times have become common. As this evolution has occurred, the rare early times were specified as FAT times. As they are now commonplace, automatic times are now expressed using the hundredths of a second. Hand times (watches operated by human beings) are not regarded as accurate and thus are only accepted to the accuracy of a tenth of a second even when the watch displays greater accuracy. If the mark was set before 1977, a converted time to the tenth was recorded for record purposes, because they did not have a system to compare between the timing methods. Frequently in those cases there is a mark to the 100th retained for that race. Over this period of evolution, some reports show hand times also followed with an \"h\" or \"ht\" to distinguish hand times.\n\nWith two different timing methods came the inevitable desire to compare times. \"Track and Field News\" initiated adding .24 to hand times as a conversion factor. Many electronic hand stopwatches display times to the hundredth. Frequently those readings are recorded, but are not accepted as valid (leading to confused results). Some low level meets have even hand timed runners and have switched places according to the time displayed on the stopwatch. All of this is, of course, wrong. Hand times are not accurate enough to be accepted for record purposes for short races. Human reaction time is not perfectly identical between different human beings. Hand times involve human beings reacting, pushing the stopwatch button when they see the smoke or hear the sound of the Starting pistol, then reacting (possibly anticipating) the runner crossing the finish line. The proper procedure for converting hand times would be to round any hundredths up to the next higher even tenth of a second and then add the .24 to get a time for comparison purposes only. But many meets displayed the converted marks accurate to the hundredth making the results look like they were taken with fully automatic timing. In these cases, some meets have displayed a 4 or a 0 in the hundredths column for all races. When detected, reports of these times are followed by a \"c\" or ' to indicate converted times.\n\nRoad race times are only considered accurate to a full second. To distinguish a full second time with hours, from a minute time with hundredths of a second, colons are used to separate hours from minutes, and minutes from seconds. A period is used to separate seconds from hundredths of a second.\n\nTransponder timing is becoming more common. The RFID detection system times the transponder chip, usually located on a runner's shoe as opposed to the official timing of the torso. Accurate to a full second, this is not significant, but in breaking microscopic ties, the data does not correspond to timing rules. Most road races cannot fit all participants onto the start line. Depending on the size of the field, some athletes could be several city blocks away from the start line and in the large crowd, could take minutes to get across the line. Results frequently indicate two times, the \"gun time\" would be the official time from the firing of the starting gun, but the mat time shows the time the shoe crossed a sensing mat at the start line to the time the shoe crossed the sensing mat at the finish line.\n\nOccasionally, when breaking ties using photo finish, times are displayed to the thousandth of a second. These times to the thousandth are not used for record purposes but times to the thousandth can be used to break ties between adjacent heats. Rules specify if a tie is broken this way, that all heats involved are recorded with the same timing system.\n\nMost records are subject to ratification by the governing body for that record. On the world level, that is the IAAF. Each body has their own procedure for ratifying the records: for example, USATF, the governing body for the United States, only ratifies records once a year at their annual meeting at the beginning of December.\nUntil a record is ratified, it is regarded as \"Pending\" which is sometimes indicated by a following P\n\nWhen a J is added, it indicates a junior record (if a junior does not reach their 20th birthday in the calendar year of the mark)\n\nSome records are ratified or tracked, but they are not to the same standard of quality or accuracy as a record. The term is \"bests.\" IAAF lists bests for the Youth division and for road racing records such as the marathon. It also tracks athlete personal achievements as bests. A Y indicates Youth. A youth athlete has not reached or will not reach their 18th birthday in the calendar year of competition.\n\n\nFor events where wind assistance is a factor (outdoor races 220 yards or less, Long Jump and Triple Jump), the wind reading is usually reported in metres per second or \"m/s\"\n\nAthlete disqualifications often reference the IAAF rule number under which the athlete was disqualified.\n\nThis is typically written in the format (false start as example): DQ R162.7\n\n\nThe various organizing bodies of the sport are abbreviated into alphabet soup.\n\n\n\nDue to the large number of athletics events that are regularly contested, presentations of results and statistics often use abbreviations to refer to the events, rather than the full form.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "590473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=590473", "title": "Contraction (grammar)", "text": "Contraction (grammar)\n\nA contraction is a shortened version of the written and spoken forms of a word, syllable, or word group, created by omission of internal letters and sounds.\n\nIn linguistic analysis, contractions should not be confused with crasis, abbreviations nor acronyms (including initialisms), with which they share some semantic and phonetic functions, though all three are connoted by the term \"abbreviation\" in loose parlance. Contraction is also distinguished from clipping, where beginnings and endings are omitted.\n\nThe definition overlaps with the term portmanteau (a linguistic \"blend\"), but a distinction can be made between a portmanteau and a contraction by noting that contractions are formed from words that would otherwise appear together in sequence, such as \"do\" and \"not\", whereas a portmanteau word is formed by combining two or more existing words that all relate to a singular concept which the portmanteau describes.\n\nEnglish has a number of contractions, mostly involving the elision of a vowel (which is replaced by an apostrophe in writing), as in \"I'm\" for \"I am\", and sometimes other changes as well, as in \"won't\" for \"will not\" or \"ain't\" for \"am not\". These contractions are commonly used in speech and in informal writing, though tend to be avoided in more formal writing (with limited exceptions, such as the mandatory form of \"o'clock\").\n\nThe main contractions are listed in the following table (for more explanation see English auxiliaries and contractions).\nSome other simplified pronunciations of common word groups, which can often equally be described as cases of elision, may also be considered (non-standard) contractions (not enshrined into the written standard language, but frequently expressed in written form anyway), such as \"wanna\" for \"want to\", \"gonna\" for \"going to\", \"y'all\" for \"you all\", \"ya'll\" for \"ya all\" in the Southern United States and others common forms in colloquial speech.\n\nIn subject–auxiliary inversion, the contracted negative forms behave as if they were auxiliaries themselves, changing place with the subject. For example, the interrogative form of \"He won't go\" is \"Won't he go\", whereas the uncontracted equivalent is \"Will he not go?\", with \"not\" following the subject.\n\nContractions exist in Classical Chinese, some of which are used in modern Chinese.\nContractions also appear in Cantonese, for example, 乜嘢 and 咩.\n\nThe French language has a variety of contractions, similar to English but mandatory, as in \"C'est la vie\" (\"That's life\"), where \"c'est\" stands for \"ce\" + \"est\" (\"that is\"). The formation of these contractions is called elision.\n\nIn general, any monosyllabic word ending in \"e caduc\" (schwa) will contract if the following word begins with a vowel, \"h\" or \"y\" (as \"h\" is silent and absorbed by the sound of the succeeding vowel; \"y\" sounds like \"i\"). In addition to \"ce\" → \"c'-\" (demonstrative pronoun \"that\"), these words are \"que\" → \"qu'-\" (conjunction, relative pronoun, or interrogative pronoun \"that\"), \"ne\" → \"n'-\" (\"not\"), \"se\" → \"s'-\" (\"himself\", \"herself\", \"itself\", \"oneself\" before a verb), \"je\" → \"j'-\" (\"I\"), \"me\" → \"m'-\" (\"me\" before a verb), \"te\" → \"t'- \" (informal singular \"you\" before a verb), \"le\" or \"la\" → \"l'-\" (\"the\"; or \"he/she\", \"it\" before a verb or after an imperative verb and before the word \"y\" or \"en\"), and \"de\" → \"d'-\" (\"of\"). Unlike with English contractions, however, these contractions are mandatory: one would never say (or write) \"*ce est\" or \"*que elle\".\n\n\"Moi\" (\"myself\") and \"toi\" (informal \"yourself\") mandatorily contract to \"m'-\" and \"t'-\" respectively after an imperative verb and before the word \"y\" or \"en\".\n\nIt is also mandatory to avoid the repetition of a sound when the conjunction \"si\" (\"if\") is followed by \"il\" (\"he\", \"it\") or \"ils\" (\"they\"), which begin with the same vowel sound \"i\": \"*si il\" → \"s'il\" (\"if it\", if he\"); \"*si ils\" → \"s'ils\" (\"if they\").\n\nCertain prepositions are also mandatorily merged with masculine and plural direct articles: \"au\" for \"à le\", \"aux\" for \"à les\", \"du\" for \"de le\", and \"des\" for \"de les\". However, the contraction of \"cela\" (demonstrative pronoun \"that\") to \"ça\" is optional and informal.\n\nIn informal speech, a personal pronoun may sometimes be contracted onto a following verb. For example, \"je ne sais pas\" (, \"I don't know\") may be pronounced roughly \"chais pas\" (), with the \"ne\" being completely elided and the of \"je\" being mixed with the of \"sais\". It is also common in informal contexts to contract \"tu\" to \"t'-\" before a vowel, e.g., \"t'as mangé\" for \"tu as mangé\".\n\nIn Modern Hebrew, the prepositional prefixes -בְּ /bə-/ 'in' and -לְ /lə-/ 'to' contract with the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) to form the prefixes -ב /ba/ 'in the' and -ל /la/ 'to the'. In colloquial Israeli Hebrew, the preposition את (/ʔet/), which indicates a definite direct object, and the definite article prefix -ה (/ha-/) are often contracted to 'ת (/ta-/) when the former immediately precedes the latter. Thus ראיתי את הכלב (/ʁaˈʔiti ʔet haˈkelev/, \"I saw the dog\") may become ראיתי ת'כלב (/ʁaˈʔiti taˈkelev/).\n\nIn Italian, prepositions merge with direct articles in predictable ways. The prepositions \"a\", \"da\", \"di\", \"in\", \"su\", \"con\" and \"per\" combine with the various forms of the definite article, namely \"il\", \"lo\", \"la\", \"l',\" \"i\", \"gli\", \"gl',\" and \"le\".\n\n\nThe words \"ci\" and \"è\" (form of \"essere\", to be) and the words \"vi\" and \"è\" are contracted into \"c'è\" and \"v'è\" (both meaning \"there is\").\n\nThe words \"dove\" and any word that begins with \"e\" are contracted into one single, deleting the e of the principal word, dove (dov'). Equally \"come\" does be made so.\nAs well other words may be contracted the same these two, like \"quale\", and other ones, etcetera.\n\nSpanish has two mandatory phonetic contractions between prepositions and articles: \"al\" (to the) for \"a el\", and \"del\" (of the) for \"de el\" (not to be confused with \"a él\", meaning \"to him\", and \"de él\", meaning \"his\" or, more literally, \"of him\").\n\nOther contractions were common in writing until the 17th century, the most usual being \"de\" + personal and demonstrative pronouns: \"destas\" for \"de estas\" (of these, fem.), \"daquel\" for \"de aquel\" (of that, masc.), \"dél\" for \"de él\" (of him) etc.; and the feminine article before words beginning with \"a-\": \"l'alma\" for \"la alma\", now \"el alma\" (the soul). Several sets of demonstrative pronouns originated as contractions of \"aquí\" (here) + pronoun, or pronoun + \"otro/a\" (other): \"aqueste\", \"aqueso\", \"estotro\" etc. The modern \"aquel\" (that, masc.) is the only survivor of the first pattern; the personal pronouns \"nosotros\" (we) and \"vosotros\" (pl. you) are remnants of the second. In medieval texts unstressed words very often appear contracted: \"todol\" for \"todo el\" (all the, masc.), \"ques\" for \"que es\" (which is); etc. including with common words, like d'ome (d'home/d'homme) instead de ome (home/homme), and so on.\n\nThough not strictly a contraction, a special form is used when combining con with mí, ti or sí which is written as \"conmigo\" for *\"con mí\" (with me), \"contigo\" for *\"con ti\" (with you sing.), \"consigo\" for *\"con sí\" (with himself/herself/itself/themselves (themself).\n\nFinally, one can hear \"pa\"' for \"para\", deriving as \"pa'l\" for \"para el\", but these forms are only considered appropriate in informal speech.\n\nIn Portuguese, contractions are common and much more numerous than those in Spanish. Several prepositions regularly contract with certain articles and pronouns. For instance, \"de\" (of) and \"por\" (by; formerly \"per\") combine with the definite articles \"o\" and \"a\" (masculine and feminine forms of \"the\" respectively), producing \"do\", \"da\" (of the), \"pelo\", \"pela\" (by the). The preposition \"de\" contracts with the pronouns \"ele\" and \"ela\" (he, she), producing \"dele\", \"dela\" (his, her). In addition, some verb forms contract with enclitic object pronouns: e.g., the verb \"amar\" (to love) combines with the pronoun \"a\" (her), giving \"amá-la\" (to love her).\n\nAnother contraction in portuguese which is similar to English ones is the combination of the pronoun \"da\" with words starting in \"a\", resulting in changing the first letter \"a\" for an apostrophe and joining both words. Examples: \"Estrela d'alva\" (A popular phrase to refer to Venus that means \"Alb star\", as a reference to its brightness) ; \"Caixa d'água\" (water tank).\n\nIn informal, spoken German prepositional phrases, one can often merge the preposition and the article; for example, \"von dem\" becomes \"vom\", \"zu dem\" becomes \"zum\", or \"an das\" becomes \"ans\". Some of these are so common that they are mandatory. In informal speech, \"aufm\" for \"auf dem\", \"unterm\" for \"unter dem\", etc. are also used, but would be considered to be incorrect if written, except maybe in quoted direct speech, in appropriate context and style.\n\nThe pronoun \"es\" often contracts to \"s\" (usually written with the apostrophe) in certain contexts. For example, the greeting \"Wie geht es?\" is usually encountered in the contracted form \"Wie geht's?\".\n\nRegional dialects of German, and various local languages which usually were already used long before today's Standard German was created, do use contractions usually more frequently than German, but varying widely between different local languages. The informally spoken German contractions are observed almost everywhere, most often accompanied by additional ones, such as \"in den\" becoming \"in'n\" (sometimes \"im\") or \"haben wir\" becoming \"hamwer\", \"hammor\", \"hemmer\", or \"hamma\" depending on local intonation preferences. Bavarian German features several more contractions such as \"gesund sind wir\" becoming \"xund samma\" which are schematically applied to all word or combinations of similar sound. (One must remember, however, that German \"wir\" exists alongside Bavarian \"mir\", or \"mia\", with the same meaning.) The Munich-born footballer Franz Beckenbauer has as his catchphrase \"Schau mer mal\" (\"Schauen wir einmal\" - in English \"let's have a look\"). A book about his career had as its title the slightly longer version of the phrase, \"Schau'n Mer Mal\".\n\nSuch features are found in all central and southern language regions. A sample from Berlin: \"Sag einmal, Meister, kann man hier einmal hinein?\" is spoken as \"Samma, Meesta, kamma hier ma rin?\"\n\nSeveral West Central German dialects along the Rhine River have built contraction patterns involving long phrases and entire sentences. In speech, words are often concatenated, and frequently the process of \"liaison\" is used. So, \"[Dat] kriegst Du nicht\" may become \"Kressenit\", or \"Lass mich gehen, habe ich gesagt\" may become \"Lomejon haschjesaat\".\n\nMostly, there are no binding orthographies for local dialects of German, hence writing is left to a great extent to authors and their publishers. Outside quotations, at least, they usually pay little attention to print more than the most commonly spoken contractions, so as not to degrade their readability. The use of apostrophes to indicate omissions is a varying and considerably less frequent process than in English-language publications.\n\nThe use of contractions is not allowed in any form of standard Norwegian spelling, however, it is fairly common to shorten or contract words in spoken language. Yet, the commonness varies from dialect to dialect and from sociolect to sociolect—it depends on the formality etc. of the setting. Some common, and quite drastic, contractions found in Norwegian speech are \"jakke\" for \"jeg har ikke\", meaning \"I do not have\" and \"dække\" for \"det er ikke\", meaning \"there is not\". The most frequently used of these contractions—usually consisting of two or three words contracted into one word, contain short, common and often monosyllabic words like , , , , or . The use of the apostrophe (') is much less common than in English, but is sometimes used in contractions to show where letters have been dropped.\n\nIn extreme cases, long, entire sentences may be written as one word. An example of this is \"Det ordner seg av seg selv\" in standard written Bokmål, meaning \"It will sort itself out\" could become \"dånesæsæsjæl\" (note the letters Å and Æ, and the word \"sjæl\", as an eye dialect spelling of ). R-dropping, being present in the example, is especially common in speech in many areas of Norway , but plays out in different ways, as does elision of word-final phonemes like .\n\nBecause of the many dialects of Norwegian and their widespread use it is often difficult to distinguish between non-standard writing of standard Norwegian and eye dialect spelling. It is almost universally true that these spellings try to convey the way each word is pronounced, but it is rare to see language written that does not adhere to at least some of the rules of the official orthography. Reasons for this include words spelled unphonemically, ignorance of conventional spelling rules, or adaptation for better transcription of that dialect's phonemes.\n\nLatin contains several examples of contractions. One such case is preserved in the verb \"nolo\" (I am unwilling/do not want) which was formed by a contraction of \"non volo\" (\"volo\" meaning “I want”). Similarly this is observed in the first person plural and third person plural forms (nolumus and nolunt respectively).\n\nSome contractions in rapid speech include ～っす (\"-ssu\") for です (\"desu\") and すいません (\"suimasen\") for すみません (\"sumimasen\"). では (\"dewa\") is often contracted to じゃ (\"ja\"). In certain grammatical contexts the particle の (\"no\") is contracted to simply ん (\"n\").\n\nWhen used after verbs ending in the conjunctive form ～て (\"-te\"), certain auxiliary verbs and their derivations are often abbreviated. Examples:\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> this abbreviation is never used in the polite conjugation, to avoid the resultant ambiguity between an abbreviated \"ikimasu\" (go) and the verb \"kimasu\" (come).\n\nThe ending ～なければ (\"-nakereba\") can be contracted to ～なきゃ (\"-nakya\") when it is used to indicate obligation. It is often used without an auxiliary, e.g., 行かなきゃ（いけない） (\"ikanakya (ikenai)\") \"I have to go.\"\n\nOther times, contractions are made to create new words or to give added or altered meaning:\n\nVarious dialects of Japanese also use their own specific contractions which are often unintelligible to speakers of other dialects.\n\nIn the Polish language pronouns have contracted forms which are more prevalent in their colloquial usage. Examples are \"go\" and \"mu\". The non-contracted forms are \"jego\" (unless it is used as a possessive pronoun) and \"jemu\", respectively. The clitic \"-ń\" which stands for \"niego\" (him) as in \"dlań\" (\"dla niego\") is more common in literature. The non-contracted forms are generally used as a means to accentuate.\n\nUyghur, a Turkic language spoken in Central Asia, includes some verbal suffixes that are actually contracted forms of compound verbs (serial verbs). For instance, \"sëtip alidu\" (sell-manage, \"manage to sell\") is usually written and pronounced \"sëtivaldu\", with the two words forming a contraction and the [p] leniting into a [v] or [w].\n\nIn Filipino, most contractions need other words to be contracted correctly. Only words that end with vowels can make a contraction with words like \"at\" and \"ay.\" In this chart, the \"@\" represents any vowel.\n"}

It is now rebuild as an exhibit at Black Country Living Museum \nSee General Store for more general information\nGregory's was originally a pair of houses built on Lawrence Lane, Old Hill, in 1883 by Charles Gregory, an iron worker. In the early 1900s the houses were converted to a double fronted shop with living accommodation up stairs for the family. The two houses were originally separated by a central tunnel or 'entry' to the back garden.\n\nGregory's held a wide variety of stock, meat and fresh produce was served from the right hand counter, this included; bacon, ham, beef suet, butter, cheese, eggs, homemade faggots, tripe and cow heel. The left hand counter sold various other items including sweets, cigarettes, clothes, hats and haberdashery items. The middle counter sold groceries and green grocery, however most of the fruit and vegetables would have been displayed outside the shop. Fruit and vegetable would have been available on a seasonal basis, and not all fruit and veg would be available all the time like we are used to today. Gregory's General Store catered for those on low wages, often allowing eggs to be sold individually and half loaves to be brought. Common essential items like tea, paraffin and butter would be sold by the penny's worth. Mrs Gregory also allowed customers to have items on the tick, meaning that she would give them the items on the basis that they would pay her when they received their wages. She would write what each customer owed in a book and tick their names off after they had paid her, hence the phrase 'on the tick'.\n\nGregory's General store was rebuilt at the Black Country Living Museum in 1980 and is set as it would have been in the 1925\n"}
{"id": "88335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88335", "title": "Gullveig", "text": "Gullveig\n\nIn Norse mythology, Gullveig is a being who was speared by the Æsir, burnt three times, and yet thrice reborn. Upon her third rebirth, Gullveig's name becomes Heiðr and she is described as a knowledgeable and skillful völva. Gullveig/Heiðr is solely attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material. Scholars have variously proposed that Gullveig/Heiðr is the same figure as the goddess Freyja, that Gullveig's death may have been connected to corruption by way of gold among the Æsir, and/or that Gullveig's treatment by the Æsir may have led to the Æsir–Vanir War.\n\nThe etymology of the Old Norse name \"Gullveig\" is problematic. The first element, \"Gull-\", means \"gold\", yet the second element, \"veig\", is murky (a situation shared with the Old Norse personal names \"Rannveig\", \"Sölveig\", and \"Thórveig\"). \"Veig\" may sometimes mean \"alcoholic drink\", \"power, strength\", and sometimes also \"gold\". The name \"Heiðr\" (Old Norse \"fame\", in adjective form \"bright, clear\") is semantically related; scholar Rudolf Simek comments that although Gullveig's name changes to \"Heiðr\", the meaning still remains basically the same. \"Heiðr\" is sometimes anglicized as Heith, Heid, or Heidi.\n\nGullveig is solely attested in the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Völuspá\". In the poem, a völva recalls that Gullveig was pierced by spears before being burnt three times in the hall of Hárr (\"Hárr\" is one of Odin's various names), and yet was three times reborn. The völva says that, presumably after Gullveig's burning, she was called \"Heiðr\" and that Heiðr was a knowledgeable völva who could perform great feats:\n\nA description of the Æsir–Vanir War follows and the poem continues thereafter.\n\nStarting with scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre, scholars such as Rudolf Simek and John Lindow have theorized that Gullveig/Heiðr is the same figure as Freyja, and that her involvement with the Æsir somehow led to the events of the Æsir–Vanir War.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "305487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305487", "title": "Mick Foley", "text": "Mick Foley\n\nMichael Francis Foley Sr. (born June 7, 1965) is an American author, actor and former professional wrestler and color commentator currently signed to WWE.\n\nFoley has worked for many wrestling promotions, including the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and Global Wrestling Federation (GWF), as well as numerous promotions in Japan. Foley is widely regarded as one of the greatest wrestlers in the history of WWE, where he participated in the main event of WrestleManias XV and 2000 – as a special guest referee in the former. Foley was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2013.\n\nFoley has wrestled under his real name and various personas, including Dude Love, Cactus Jack and Mankind, also known as the \"Three Faces of Foley\". He is a four-time world champion (three WWF Championships and one TNA World Heavyweight Championship), an eleven-time world tag team champion (eight WWF Tag Team Championships, two ECW World Tag Team Championships and one WCW World Tag Team Championship), a one-time TNA Legends Champion and the inaugural WWF Hardcore Champion.\n\nFoley was born in Bloomington, Indiana. He has an older brother named John. Shortly after his birth, Foley's family moved to East Setauket, New York, where Foley attended Ward Melville High School, played lacrosse, and wrestled. Foley is of Irish descent. Foley was a high school classmate of actor Kevin James. The two were on the wrestling team together and attended the same college. While a student at State University of New York at Cortland, he hitchhiked to Madison Square Garden to see his favorite wrestler, Jimmy Snuka, in a steel cage match against Don Muraco. Foley has said that Snuka's flying body splash from the top of the cage inspired him to pursue a career in pro wrestling. Foley had a front row seat and is visible on the video of the event.\n\nMick Foley formally trained at Dominic DeNucci's wrestling school in Freedom, Pennsylvania, driving several hours weekly from his college campus in Cortland, New York, and debuted in 1983. In addition to appearing on DeNucci's cards, Foley and several other students also took part in some squash matches as jobbers for WWF TV tapings of \"Prime Time Wrestling\" and \"Superstars of Wrestling\", where Foley wrestled under the names Jack Foley and Nick Foley. In one of these matches (the very first episode of Superstars), Foley and Les Thornton (another jobber) faced the British Bulldogs, during which the Dynamite Kid (who had a long earned reputation as a stiff worker in the ring) clotheslined Foley with such force that he was unable to eat solid food for several weeks. During these squash matches, Foley also faced other top level talent at the time, such as Hercules Hernandez. His run would not last long, as he had not signed a contract with the promotion at the time. During this run, he was also billed from different hometowns and at different weights.\n\nAfter several years of wrestling in the independent circuit, Foley began receiving offers from various regional promotions, including Bill Watts' Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). He joined the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) as Cactus Jack Manson, where he teamed with Gary Young as part of the Stud Stable. Cactus and Young briefly held the CWA tag titles in late 1988. On November 20, Foley left CWA for Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling.\n\nIn World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), Cactus Jack, billed as Cactus Jack Manson, was a major part of Skandor Akbar's stable. (The addition of \"Manson\" to Foley's name, due to its implied connection to Charles Manson, made him uncomfortable.) Foley also won several titles, including the company's light heavyweight and tag team titles before leaving the company, losing his last match to Eric Embry in nine seconds. He then briefly competed in Alabama's Continental Wrestling Federation before completing a brief stint with World Championship Wrestling. For much of his time there, he would team with jobbers. When the jobber would lose the match for the team, Cactus Jack would attack his partner, throw them out of the ring, and deliver his infamous ring apron flying elbow drop onto the concrete floor. His biggest match at the time was against Mil Máscaras at . It was during this period that Foley was involved in a car accident that resulted in the loss of his two front teeth, adding to the distinctive look for which he is famous. Following the short stint with WCW, Foley then signed with Herb Abrams's Universal Wrestling Federation. In UWF, Foley teamed with Bob Orton to feud with Don Muraco, Sunny Beach, and Brian Blair.\n\nHe soon left UWF for Tri-State Wrestling (a forerunner to Extreme Championship Wrestling), whose high-impact and violent wrestling style fit Foley well. On one night, known as Tri-State's Summer Sizzler 1991, Cactus Jack and Eddie Gilbert had three matches in one night: Cactus won a Falls Count Anywhere match, lost a Stretcher match, and then fought to a double disqualification in a Steel Cage match. These matches caught the attention of World Championship Wrestling promoters, in large part due to widespread photo circulation. In 1991, after a brief stint working in the Global Wrestling Federation, Foley joined WCW full-time.\n\nOn September 5, 1991, Cactus Jack debuted as a heel and attacked Sting. After feuds with Van Hammer and Abdullah the Butcher, Cactus Jack faced Sting, then WCW World Heavyweight Champion, in a non-title Falls Count Anywhere match at Beach Blast in 1992, which Sting won. For a long time, Foley considered this the best match he ever worked. Unlike Jack's first stint in WCW, where his personality was quieter, he was now outwardly maniacal; laughing hysterically, shrieking into the air while choking his opponents and yelling his signature catch phrase \"Bang-Bang!\".\n\nAfter spending a year and a half with WCW as a heel, Cactus Jack transitioned into a fan favorite after engaging in a feud with Paul Orndorff, Harley Race and Big Van Vader. Jack and Orndorff wrestled each other in a match for a spot on WCW World Heavyweight Champion Vader's team at a Clash of the Champions event. After the match, Race and Orndorff beat up Jack. At the following Clash of Champions event, Cactus Jack helped Sting's team win the match. He engaged in a feud with Orndorff, winning a falls-count-anywhere match against Orndorff at SuperBrawl III. He then moved on to face Big Van Vader.\n\nCactus Jack wrestled Big Van Vader on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, but being severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Harley Race removed the protective mats at ringside and Vader powerbombed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot. While Foley was away, WCW ran an angle where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a farcical comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia. Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy vignettes that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in \"Have a Nice Day\" that they were the brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved.\n\nIn one of WCW's most brutal matches of all time, Cactus faced Vader in a Texas Death match at Halloween Havoc. Race won the match for Vader by using a cattle prod on Cactus, knocking him out. The level of violence involved in this feud caused WCW to refuse to book Cactus Jack against Vader on a pay-per-view again. On March 16, 1994, during a WCW European tour, Foley and Big Van Vader had one of the most infamous matches in wrestling history in Munich, Germany. Foley began a hangman—a planned move where a wrestler's head is tangled between the top two ring ropes. Neither wrestler was aware that the ring ropes had been drawn extra tight before the event, and Foley was barely able to move. When Foley finally freed himself from the ropes and fell out of the ring, his ears were badly split at the back. When Foley re-entered the ring the two wrestlers began trading blows. During this time, Vader reached up and grabbed Foley's ear, and ripped it off. The two men continued wrestling as the referee picked up the ear and gave it to the ring announcer. Vader claimed for years after that the ear had come off during the botched Hangman maneuver, however in a WWE Network video, Vader admits that after seeing footage that he had indeed removed Foley's ear. Cactus Jack and Kevin Sullivan were scheduled to win the tag team titles at Slamboree in 1994. Foley had to choose between reattaching his ear or wrestling in the pay-per-view and winning the titles. Foley chose to wrestle and won his only championship in WCW. Later on, Foley was frustrated by WCW's reluctance to work a storyline around losing his ear.\n\nWCW also shared a brief co-promotion with ECW during this time in which Foley represented WCW on ECW television as the WCW Tag Team champion, facing Sabu at Hostile City Showdown on June 24, 1994. During a promo, Foley spat on his Tag Team title belt and threw it to the ground to appeal to the hardcore fans who frowned upon the mainstream promotions.\n\nCactus Jack's first appearance for the NWA-affiliated Eastern Championship Wrestling came on the May 31, 1994 episode, with Cactus revealed as Sabu's opponent for June 24 at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia. After being part of a talent exchange between ECW & WCW, Foley brought his WCW tag team title belt and spit on it for a recorded ECW tv segment. Foley continued with ECW, and began a feud with Sabu. Foley then began working the ECW tag team division on teams with Terry Funk, Mikey Whipwreck, and Kevin Sullivan. He had two ECW World Tag Team Championship reigns with Whipwreck while in ECW.\n\nAfter the stints in Smokey Mountain Wrestling and Japan noted below, Foley then returned to ECW to have a series of violent encounters with the Sandman, while challenging him and claiming that he had never been beaten in a falls count anywhere match. He then started to team with Tommy Dreamer. According to Heyman, Hardcore style differentiated Foley from other traditional wrestlers, so in ECW, Foley was right at home. After seeing a sign in the audience one night that said \"Cane Dewey\" a reference to Foley's real life son, Foley began a gimmick where he criticized hardcore wrestling and sought to renounce his status as a hardcore wrestling icon and used a very technical, slow wrestling as a way to punish the audience. He said that he was on a mission to save his partner from making the mistake of trying to please bloodthirsty fans. The mismatched partnership lasted until August 5, 1995, when Cactus turned on Dreamer when they were teaming with The Pitbulls against Raven, Stevie Richards and The Dudley Brothers (Dudley Dudley and Big Dick Dudley). Cactus Jack DDT'ed his partner and joined Raven's Nest, as he wished to serve Raven's \"higher purpose\". He remained one of Raven's top henchmen for the remainder of his time in ECW. On August 28, Cactus beat the previously undefeated 911. As part of Foley's heel gimmick, he began praising WWF and WCW on ECW television, which angered ECW fans. Their anger intensified once word began to spread that Foley was leaving to join the WWF (In \"Have a Nice Day\", Foley recounted an incident where he asked an ECW roadie to sell T-shirts for him at an event held in a Queens, New York venue where he had been popular even as a heel; the man came back after being spat upon numerous times by angry fans, who made him fear for his life). Even when he tried to give sincere good-byes to the fans, Cactus Jack was met with chants of \"You sold out\" by the ECW fanbase everywhere he went. Cactus was booked to face WWF hater Shane Douglas, who won when he put Jack into a figure four leglock that allowed Mikey Whipwreck to hit him repeatedly with a steel chair. Foley's last ECW match was against Whipwreck on March 9, 1996, and he recounts that he was not looking forward to it due to the increasingly hostile reactions he got even when he wasn't in character. The ECW fans, who knew that this was Foley's last match, finally returned his affection. They cheered him throughout the match and chanted, \"Please don't go!\". After the match, Foley told the audience that their reaction made everything worthwhile and made his exit by dancing with Stevie Richards and The Blue Meanie to Frank Sinatra's song \"New York, New York\". Foley has said that this exit was his favorite moment in wrestling.\n\nAt the tail end of 1994, Foley joined Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) as Cactus Jack, causing Boo Bradley to lose the SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship. He often teamed with Brian Lee to feud with Bradley and Chris Candido. Cactus Jack then began a crusade to rid Bradley of his valet Tamara Fytch. He ignited a feud between Candido and Bradley when he accused Candido of having sexual relations with Fytch. (Ironically, Candido and Fytch were a couple in real life). Cactus Jack left SMW before the feud was resolved.\n\nIn 1995, Foley went to Japan and wrestled in International Wrestling Association of Japan (IWA Japan), where he engaged in feuds with Terry Funk and Shoji Nakamaki. During his brief stint in Japan Foley had the nickname \"Tsunami Stopper.\" Foley, however, soon returned to ECW to feud with The Sandman. Funk returned to team up with Sandman, and during a particularly violent spot, the pair hit Cactus with a Singapore cane forty-six times. Cactus Jack then defeated Funk at Hostile City Showdown 1995. Later, he fought Sandman for the ECW championship. During the match, Cactus Jack knocked Sandman unconscious and was declared the winner. Referee Bill Alfonso, however, reversed his decision on the grounds that the title cannot change hands by knockout.\n\nReturning to the IWA, Cactus Jack began a feud with Leatherface, whom he had betrayed during a tag team match. Foley also continued to wrestle in independent circuits, winning championships on the Ozark Mountain and Steel City circuits. On August 20, 1995, IWA organized a King of the Death Match tournament at their Kawasaki Dream event. Each level of the tournament featured a new and deadly gimmick: Cactus Jack's first round was a barbed-wire baseball bat, thumbtack death match, in which he defeated Terry Gordy; the second round was a barbed-wire board, bed of nails match where Cactus Jack defeated Shoji Nakamaki. The final, against Terry Funk, was a barbed-wire rope, barbed-wire and C4 board, time-bomb death match, which Cactus Jack won with help from Tiger Jeet Singh. After the match, both men were ravaged by the wire, and burned by the C4 explosions. Foley later said that he only received $300 for the entire night but in 2010 he wrote that, \"looking back that match in Honjo is probably the performance I'm proudest of.\" After the tournament, he teamed with Tracy Smothers for a quick run with the IWA tag team titles.\n\nIn 1996, Foley signed a contract with WWF and, this time, the WWF did not use Foley as \"enhancement talent\". He was shown several designs for a new character—a man with a leather mask and chains. However, WWF decided that it was too dark and only left the mask. Foley arrived in the WWF in 1996 with a new gimmick and perhaps his most famous personality: Mankind, a mentally deranged schizophrenic who constantly squealed (even throughout his matches), shrieked \"Mommy!\", spoke to a rat named George, enjoyed pain, physically abused himself (such as by pulling out his hair), wore a mask and lived in boiler rooms; hence, his specialty match, the Boiler Room Brawl. Mankind's finishing move was the mandible claw nerve hold, which involved sticking his fingers in his opponent's mouth. His catch phrase was \"Have a nice day\". On the April 1, 1996, episode of \"Raw is War\", the day after WrestleMania XII, Mankind debuted and defeated Bob Holly, quickly moving into a feud with The Undertaker. The two then began interfering in the other's matches until they were booked in the first ever Boiler Room brawl, in which the goal was to escape the arena's boiler room and reach the ring to take the urn from Paul Bearer. The Undertaker appeared to have won, but Paul Bearer refused to hand him the urn, allowing Mankind to win, thus (for the time being) ending the relationship between Paul and The Undertaker. While Mankind was managed by Paul Bearer, he referred to him as \"Uncle Paul\". Mankind then earned the number one contendership to face the then WWF Champion Shawn Michaels at . Michaels won by disqualification via interference by Vader and The Undertaker.\n\nThe Mankind and Undertaker rivalry continued with the first ever Buried Alive match at . Undertaker won the match, but Paul Bearer, the Executioner, Mankind and other heels attacked The Undertaker and buried him alive. Afterward, The Undertaker challenged Mankind to a match at Survivor Series, which the Undertaker won. The feud continued after another match at for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which Undertaker had won at WrestleMania 13. Undertaker won the match and Bearer took a leave of absence, continuing the feud. Jim Ross then began conducting a series of interviews with Mankind. During the interviews, Ross brought up the topic of Foley's home videos and the hippie-inspired character he played in them, Dude Love, as well as his tormented journey in wrestling. The interviews also had an effect on the fans, who began cheering Mankind, turning him into a face.\n\nAround this time, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels won the WWF Tag Team Championships from Owen Hart and The British Bulldog, but Michaels was injured and could no longer compete. Mankind tried to replace him, but Austin said he wanted \"nothing to do with a freak\" and resigned himself to facing Hart and the Bulldog alone the next week. Halfway into the match, however, Foley debuted a new persona known as Dude Love, who helped Austin take the victory, becoming the new Tag Team Champions. Austin and Foley vacated their tag team titles when Austin suffered a neck injury in a match at SummerSlam. Dude Love feuded with Hunter Hearst Helmsley, as the two competed in a Falls Count Anywhere match. One of Foley's most memorable vignettes aired before the match began, in which Dude Love and Mankind discussed who should wrestle the upcoming match. Eventually, \"they\" decided that it should be Cactus Jack, and Foley's old character made his WWF debut. Cactus Jack won the match with a piledriver through a table. Shortly thereafter, ECW's Terry Funk joined the WWF as Chainsaw Charlie. At the 1998 Royal Rumble, Foley participated under three personas, Cactus Jack, Mankind, and Dude Love. Charlie and Jack defeated the New Age Outlaws at WrestleMania XIV in a Dumpster match to win the tag team titles. The next night, however, Vince McMahon stripped them of the belts and scheduled a rematch in a steel cage, which the Outlaws won with help from their new allies, D-Generation X. On April 6, 1998, Foley turned heel when Cactus Jack explained the fans would not see him anymore because they did not appreciate him and only cared about Stone Cold Steve Austin. Vince McMahon explained to Austin the next week that he would face a \"mystery\" opponent at . That opponent turned out to be Dude Love, who won the match by disqualification, meaning that Austin retained the title. McMahon, displeased with the outcome, required Foley to prove he deserved another shot at Austin's title with a number one contendership match against his former partner, Terry Funk. The match was both the WWF's first ever \"Hardcore match\" and the first time that Foley wrestled under his own name. Foley won, and after the match, a proud McMahon came out to Dude Love's music and presented Foley with the Dude Love costume. At , Dude Love took on Austin for the title. McMahon designated his subordinates Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson as the timekeeper and ring announcer, and made himself the special referee. The Undertaker, however, came to ringside to ensure McMahon called the match fairly, and with his presence, Dude Love lost the match and was \"fired\" by McMahon on the June 1 episode of \"Raw\".\n\nOn that same episode of \"Raw\", Foley reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked shirt with a loose necktie and resumed his feud with The Undertaker. At King of the Ring on June 28, the two performed in the third Hell in a Cell match, which became one of most notable matches in professional wrestling history. Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential bumps. His character lost the match to conclude their storyline.\n\nAlthough conventional wisdom holds that the Hell in a Cell match was responsible for Foley's rise to main event status, live television crowds did not initially get behind Mankind because of the match. Following a couple months of teaming with Kane, who together won the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions, Foley decided that crowds might respond better if Mankind were more of a comedy character, and so he abandoned the tortured soul characteristics and became more of a goofy, broken down oaf. He began the transition into this character following SummerSlam in 1998, after Kane turned on him and the two lost the tag team championships.\n\nThe following month, Foley began an angle with Vince McMahon, with Mankind trying to be a friend to the hated Mr. McMahon. On the October 5 episode of \"Raw\", while McMahon was in a hospital nursing wounds suffered at the hands of The Undertaker and Kane, Mankind arrived to cheer him up. Having succeeded only in irritating McMahon, Mankind then took a sock off his foot to create a sock puppet named \"Mr. Socko\". Intended to be a one-time joke, Socko became an overnight sensation. Mankind began putting the sock on his hand before applying his finisher, the mandible claw, stuffing a smelly sock in the mouths of opposing wrestlers. The sweatsock became massively popular with the fans, mainly because it was marketed (mostly by Jerry \"The King\" Lawler during the events) as being a dirty, smelly, sweaty, repulsive, and vile sock. McMahon manipulated Mankind, who saw the WWF owner as a father figure, into doing his bidding. McMahon created the Hardcore Championship and awarded it to Mankind, making him the first-ever champion of the hardcore division. Mankind was then pushed as the favorite to win the WWF Championship at Survivor Series, as McMahon appeared to be manipulating the tournament so that Mankind would win. He and The Rock both reached the finals, where McMahon turned on Mankind. As The Rock placed Mankind in the Sharpshooter, McMahon ordered the timekeeper to ring the bell even though Mankind did not submit, a reference to the Montreal Screwjob from the year before. As a result of Survivor Series, Mankind officially turned face, while The Rock turned heel and the crown jewel in McMahon's new Corporation faction.\n\nAfter weeks of trying to get his hands on McMahon's new faction, the Corporation, Mankind received a title shot against The Rock at . Mankind won the match by shoving a stench-ridden sock down The Rock's gullet, but McMahon ruled that the title would not change hands because Mankind did not win by pinfall or submission. After several weeks of going after the Corporation, Mankind defeated The Rock to win his first WWF Championship on December 29. The taped show was broadcast on January 4, 1999, so that is the date WWE recognizes as beginning the title run. Having title changes on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view was uncommon in professional wrestling, but because of the , TV ratings became more important. The rival WCW, attempting to take advantage of the fact that their show \"Monday Nitro\" aired live while Mankind's title victory was taped the week before, had announcer Tony Schiavone reveal the ending of the Mankind-Rock match before it aired. He then added sarcastically, \"That'll put a lot of butts in the seats.\" The move backfired for WCW, as Nielsen ratings showed that Raw won the ratings battle that night, despite the Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash main event which led to the reformation of the New World Order. Foley said that the ratings indicate that large numbers of viewers switched from \"Nitro\" to \"Raw\" to see him win the title and took great personal pride from this.\n\nMankind lost the WWF Championship to The Rock in an \"I Quit\" match at Royal Rumble, in what is regarded as one of the company's most violent matches. During the match, Foley took several bumps, including eleven unprotected chair shots to the head. This match is featured in Barry Blaustein's documentary \"Beyond the Mat\", which shows the impact the match had on Foley and his family at ringside. The match ended after Mankind lost consciousness, and The Rock's allies played a recording of Mankind saying \"I Quit\" from an earlier interview. The match was also voted 1999's Match of the Year by the readers of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\". Mankind won the title back in a rematch on Halftime Heat, which aired during halftime of Super Bowl XXXIII, in the WWF's first ever Empty Arena match on January 31. The two then competed in a Last Man Standing match at , which ended without a winner, meaning that Mankind retained the title. The next night, Mr. McMahon booked a ladder match for the championship, which The Rock won with help from The Big Show. Foley would go on to WrestleMania to defeat The Big Show and again at Backlash a month later. Shortly after Big Show would team with Mankind, Test and Shamrock to take on the Corporation at Over The Edge. Later in the year, Foley and The Rock patched up their friendship and teamed up to form a comedy team called the Rock 'n' Sock Connection, becoming one of the most popular teams during that time. The pair won the tag team titles on three occasions. Foley helped \"Raw\" achieve its highest ratings ever with a segment featuring himself (as Mankind) and The Rock. The \"This is Your Life\" segment aired on September 27, 1999, and received an 8.4 rating.\n\nIn August 1999, Foley returned after a three-month absence recovering from knee surgery to resume his feud with Triple H. On an episode of \"Raw\", Mankind drew with Triple H in a match for the number one contender for the WWF Championship, which resulted in a Triple Threat match between Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind at SummerSlam for the title. Foley won the WWF Championship for the third time at SummerSlam, pinning the reigning champion Austin. Mankind's win led to an enraged Triple H to assault Austin, justifying Austin's absence while he healed a knee injury. The next night on \"Raw\", Triple H defeated Mankind to win his first WWF championship. A feud then developed between Mankind and the McMahon-Helmsley regime, led by Triple H.\n\nFoley then reverted to his Cactus Jack persona in January 2000 and faced Triple H for the WWF Championship at Royal Rumble in a Street Fight. Cactus used barbed wire 2x4 and thumbtacks, trademark weapons from his pre-WWF days, but Triple H won the match after delivering two pedigrees, the second onto a pile of tacks. This feud culminated with a rematch at No Way Out in a Hell in a Cell match, where stipulations held that if Cactus Jack did not win the title, Foley would retire from wrestling. During the match, they had made their way onto the top of the cell and Foley was preparing to piledrive Triple H onto a barbed wire 2x4 on fire, but Triple H reversed it into a backdrop, causing the cage to give way, Foley fell through the canvas. One pedigree later, Triple H had won the match and Mick's career was over. Foley left for a few weeks, but returned at the request of Linda McMahon to wrestle for the title at WrestleMania 2000 against Triple H, The Rock and Big Show. Triple H won and Foley did not wrestle again for four years.\n\nAfter retiring from active competition, Foley served as storyline WWF Commissioner under his real name rather than one of his personas. Foley has said that he intended for his Commissioner Foley character to be a \"role model for nerds,\" cracking lame jokes and making no attempt to appear tough or scary. He also had a knack during this time to have no one spot for his office; rather, Mick would have an office in all sorts of odd places (for example, closets). Foley turned getting cheap pops into something of a catchphrase, as he shamelessly declared at each WWF show that he was thrilled to be \"right here in (whatever city in which he was performing (e.g., New York))!\" punctuated with an intentionally cheesy thumbs-up gesture. During this time, Commissioner Foley engaged in rivalries with Kurt Angle, Edge and Christian, and Vince McMahon without actually wrestling them. He left the position in December 2000 after being \"fired\" onscreen by McMahon during which he received a brutal beat down.\n\nFoley made a surprise return on the \"Raw\" just prior to WrestleMania X-Seven and announced that he would be the special guest referee in the match between Mr. McMahon and his son Shane at WrestleMania. After WrestleMania, Foley made sporadic appearances on WWF programming throughout the middle of the year, at one point introducing Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura during a taping of \"Raw\" in the state as a foil to Mr. McMahon, as well as serving as the guest referee for the Earl Hebner versus Nick Patrick Referee match at the WWF Invasion pay-per-view.\n\nFoley returned as commissioner in October 2001, near the end of The Invasion angle. During this brief tenure, Foley had the opportunity to shoot on the WWF's direction and how dissatisfied he was with it. Saying that there were far too many championships in the company, he booked unification matches prior to the final pay-per-view of the storyline, Survivor Series. After Survivor Series, he ended his commissionership at Vince McMahon's request and left the company.\n\nDuring his absences from WWE, Foley made frequent appearances on the independent circuit from 2003 to 2005, primarily in non-wrestling roles, either as a referee, manager, or special guest.\n\nHis first independent circuit appearance was on December 12, 2003 for International Wrestling Cartel, where he was the special guest referee for a match between Dusty Rhodes and Jerry Lawler.\n\nFoley did not appear on the independent circuit again until May 2004, when he appeared for the Japanese promotion HUSTLE and returned to the ring to face Toshiaki Kawada for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, but ended up losing.\n\nOn September 11, 2004, Foley made his debut for Ring of Honor and cut a promo, praising ROH and referring to it as \"Ring of Hardcore\", thus establishing himself as a babyface. On October 3, Foley refereed a match between Jerry Lawler and Slyck Wagner Brown for the New England Wrestling promotion. On October 15, Foley returned to ROH where he confronted Ricky Steamboat, who claimed that traditional wrestling was better than hardcore wrestling. The next day, both Foley and Steamboat cut promos on each other, leading to a match between two teams of wrestlers handpicked by both men, with Nigel McGuiness and Chad Collyer representing Steamboat and Dan Maff and B.J. Whitmer representing Foley, which was won by McGuiness and Collyer. On November 6, Foley teased a heel turn when he called ROH Champion Samoa Joe \"softcore\". On November 20, Foley made a surprise appearance for New York Wrestling Connection, making a run-in during Mikey Whipwreck and Ken Scampi's match against Mayhem and Tony Burma, where he helped Whipwreck and Scampi win.\n\nFoley made an appearance on the Night of Appreciation for Sabu, where he refereed the match between Shane Douglas and Raven, where Sabu himself interfered in the match and helped Douglas win.\n\nFoley returned to ROH on December 26 at ROH's Final Battle event and had his final confrontation with Ricky Steamboat, where the two made peace. On January 15, 2005, Foley turned heel after he was confronted by Samoa Joe and hit Joe over the head with a steel chair. One week later, Foley appeared with Border City Wrestling to referee the match between Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin for the BCW Television Championship, which Sabin won.\n\nFoley refereed the main event of the first WrestleReunion show, which saw Dusty Rhodes, Dustin Rhodes, and Mike Graham battle Abdullah the Butcher, Kevin Sullivan, and CM Punk.\n\nOn February 19, Foley resumed his feud with Samoa Joe in ROH, teasing a return to the ring but instead choosing Vordell Walker to fight Joe. After Joe defeated Walker, Foley introduced his \"backup plan\" New Cactus Jack to fight Joe in a second match, which Joe won as well.\n\nOn February 26, Foley appeared with Frank Goodman's USA Xtreme promotion, cutting a promo saying that there was no need to wait until June for an ECW reunion (referring to the upcoming Hardcore Homecoming show being put together by Shane Douglas), and brought out Axl Rotten, Shane Douglas, Chris Candido, Tammy Sytch, Balls Mahoney, Al Snow, Justin Credible, The Sandman, Terry Funk and Sabu, much to the excitement of the crowd, who began an \"E-C-Dub!\" chant. But then Raven came out and cut a promo saying that he had only ever been the one true star of ECW and everyone else had just been a jobber, leading to a match between Raven and Balls Mahoney later in the night, which Raven won by DQ when he threw fire in Mahoney's eyes. After this, Foley and several of the other ECW alumni came to the ring and attacked Raven.\n\nOn April 2, Foley appeared with Harley Race's World League Wrestling to referee a match between Trevor Rhodes and Brandon Bishop, which was ruled a No-Contest. After the match, Rhodes, Bishop, and Johnny Gold all attacked Foley until Terry Funk and Harley Race ran in and fought the three wrestlers off. Afterwards, Foley left the arena with Funk and Race.\n\nOn April 30, Foley refereed a match at a Northeast Wrestling show between Jerry Lawler and King Kong Bundy, which Lawler won.\n\nOn May 7, Foley made a return to the ring at the Mark Curtis Memorial Show, where he was victorious in a tag team match with Shane Douglas against Al Snow and D'Lo Brown, which also featured Dominic DeNucci (Foley and Douglas' trainer) in his and Douglas' corner.\n\nThe main event of the ECW reunion show Hardcore Homecoming was Terry Funk against Sabu and Shane Douglas in a Triple Threat Elimination No Ropes Barbed Wire Match. During the middle of the match, Bill Alfonso, who was in Sabu's corner, began pulling Shane Douglas into the wire, which led to Francine, who was in Douglas' corner, attacking Alfonso. Using this as a distraction, Douglas brought a ladder into the ring when suddenly the lights in the arena went out. When they came back on, Foley was in the ring, as Cactus Jack, wearing a referee shirt. Foley pulled out a barbed-wire wrapped Mr. Socko and applied the Mandible Claw on Douglas, then DDT'd Douglas onto a steel chair. Terry Funk then crawled onto Douglas and eliminated him when Foley made the 3-count. After that, Funk targeted Sabu, throwing him into the barbed wire, then setting up a table and putting Sabu on it. Funk then climbed up the ladder, but before he got far, it collapsed from under his weight, sending him crashing through the table. Sabu then recovered, gave Funk an Arabian Facebuster off a chair, and pinned Funk to win the match. After the match ended, all four of them were greeted with chants of \"Terry!\" and \"Sabu!\" and \"Foley!\" and \"Thank You Shane!\" and of course \"E-C-Dub! E-C-Dub!\". The entire locker room emptied moments later and celebrated with Funk, Sabu, Foley, and Douglas in the ring to continued \"E-C-Dub\" chants.\n\nOn July 8, Foley returned to ROH as a face, confronting ROH Champion CM Punk, who had turned heel and mocked ROH and the championship after he had signed with WWE and threatened to take the title with him to WWE. Foley acted as a direct line to Vince McMahon, attempting to convince Punk to defend his title one last time on McMahon's orders before he departed from ROH.\n\nOn August 13, Foley made an appearance with Ballpark Brawl to make fun of Matt Striker, who had been doing an impersonation of The Rock. Later in the event, Foley refereed the Canes, Tables, and Chairs match between Sandman and Sabu, which Sandman won. After the match, Foley celebrated with Sandman by drinking beer with him in the middle of the ring.\n\nOn August 20, Foley returned to ROH again, as a face, to rescue Jade Chung from Prince Nana. Foley was then attacked from behind by Alex Shelley and The Embassy until Austin Aries and Roderick Strong chased them off. One week later, Foley returned to the ring for the second WrestleReunion show to team with Terry Funk and Dory Funk, Jr. in a losing effort against the Midnight Express (Stan Lane, Bobby Eaton, and Dennis Condrey.)\n\nFoley made his final regular appearance with ROH on September 17, when he was in A.J. Styles' corner in a match against Embassy member Jimmy Rave, which Styles won. Afterwards, Foley put over ROH huge saying he enjoyed being on ROH shows and would speak highly of it.\n\nFoley made his final major independent circuit appearance on the Tribute to \"Starrcade\" show on November 19 as the referee for the match between Dustin Rhodes and Terry Funk, which ended in a No-Contest.\n\nFoley returned in June 2003 to referee the Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and Kevin Nash at Bad Blood. On June 23, during a \"Raw\" broadcast in Madison Square Garden, he was honored for his achievements in the ring and presented with the retired WWE Hardcore Championship belt. The evening ended with Foley taking a beating and kicked down stairs by Randy Orton and Ric Flair. In December 2003, Foley returned to replace Steve Austin as co-general manager of \"Raw\". He soon grew tired of the day-to-day travel and left his full-time duties to write and spend time with his family. In the storyline, Foley was afraid to wrestle a match with Intercontinental Champion Randy Orton on the December 15 episode of \"Raw\" and walked out of the match rather than face him, the result of the match was ruled a draw. After Foley walked backstage, Orton confronted him asking why he walked out of the match, calling him a coward in the process, before spitting in his face. Foley walked out of the arena afterwards.\n\nIn 2004, Foley returned briefly to wrestling, competing in the Royal Rumble and eliminating both Orton and himself with his trademark Cactus Jack clothesline. He and The Rock reunited as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection and lost a handicap match to Evolution at WrestleMania XX. Foley and Orton continued to feud, culminating in a hardcore match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship at Backlash, where Orton defeated Foley, as his Cactus Jack persona, to retain the title. Foley regards this match as possibly the best of his career.\n\nFoley appeared as a color commentator at WWE's ECW One Night Stand, which aired on June 12, 2005, and subsequently renewed his contract with WWE. Foley returned in 2005 in a match where fans were able to vote on which persona he would appear as—Mankind, Dude Love, or Cactus Jack—against Carlito at Taboo Tuesday. The fans voted for Mankind, who went on to win the match. On the February 16, 2006, \"Raw\", Foley returned to referee the WWE Championship match between Edge and John Cena. After Cena won, Edge attacked Foley, and the following week, Edge challenged Foley to a match at WrestleMania 22. Edge defeated Foley after spearing him through a flaming table. In the weeks after the match, Foley turned heel and allied himself with Edge against the newly rejuvenated ECW. At ECW One Night Stand, Foley, Edge and Lita defeated Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer and Beulah McGillicutty.\n\nFoley then engaged in a storyline rivalry with Ric Flair, inspired by real-life animosity between the two. In \"Have a Nice Day!\", Foley wrote that Flair was \"every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it.\" In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was \"a glorified stuntman\" and that he was able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a \"Raw\" event in 2003, but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled. To spark the feud, Flair again called Foley a \"glorified stuntman\" and Foley called Flair a \"washed up piece of crap\" and challenged him to a match. The result was a Two-out-of-Three Falls match at Vengeance, where Flair beat Foley in two straight falls. The two then wrestled an \"I Quit\" match at SummerSlam, which Flair won when he forced Foley to quit by threatening Melina with a barbed-wire bat. On the August 21 episode of \"Raw\", Foley kissed Vince McMahon's buttocks as part of McMahon's \"Kiss My Ass Club\" gimmick after he threatened to fire Melina. Shortly thereafter, she betrayed Foley and announced that he was fired.\n\nSeven months later, Foley made his return to \"Raw\" on March 5, 2007, with the storyline being that he tricked McMahon into giving him his job back. At , Foley wrestled in a WWE Championship Challenge match involving WWE Champion John Cena, Randy Orton, King Booker, and Bobby Lashley. Cena retained by pinning Foley. A month later, Foley made an appearance on \"Raw\" as the special guest referee for a match between Jonathan Coachman and Mr. McMahon's storyline illegitimate son Hornswoggle. Foley then made an appearance on \"SmackDown\" the same week, where he defeated Coachman with Hornswoggle as the special guest referee. On the January 7, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Foley and his tag team partner Hornswoggle qualified for the Royal Rumble by defeating The Highlanders, but Foley was eliminated by Triple H during the Royal Rumble match.\n\nFoley debuted as a color commentator for SmackDown alongside Michael Cole at Backlash in 2008, replacing Jonathan Coachman. On the edition of August 1 of \"SmackDown\", Foley was kayfabe attacked by Edge during Edge's promo for his SummerSlam match against The Undertaker. Foley sat out the August 8 \"SmackDown\" to sell his recovery from the injuries. Tazz filled in for Foley as a color commentator on \"SmackDown\", while Raw wrestler Matt Striker filled in for Tazz on \"ECW\". Foley told Long Island Press pro wrestling columnist Josh Stewart in August 2008 that \"creatively, the announcing job wasn't working out too well\". He expanded with Dave Meltzer on the Observer radio show that the environment was creatively frustrating. Foley allowed his contract with WWE to expire on September 1, 2008 and quietly left the company.\n\nOn September 3, 2008, Foley's agency, Gillespie Talent, issued a press release that stated Foley had signed a short-term deal with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Foley claimed in the statement to be \"very excited about the specifics of this agreement and the potential it holds\". Foley made his TNA debut on September 5, at a TNA house show giving a short speech about how he loved the product, in which he also belittled WWE. The official TNA Wrestling website featured an image of a smiley face with a variation of Foley's catch phrase, \"Have a nice day!\" (and, before No Surrender, \"Have a nice Sunday!\").\nOn the edition of September 18, 2008 of \"Impact!\", Foley made his first televised appearance for TNA, where Jeff Jarrett introduced him to the audience on the arena's video wall. Two weeks later, Foley made his full television debut in a promo making comments about the WWE roster, Vince McMahon and Kurt Angle. At Bound for Glory IV, he was the special guest enforcer for Jarrett and Angle's match. Later, on \"Impact!\", Foley said goodbye, but was then approached by Jeff Jarrett with a new offer; he later indicated that they had come to terms on a new contract and would make a major announcement the next week. On the October 23 episode of \"Impact!\", Foley announced that he was now co-owner of TNA along with Jarrett, just after Kurt Angle headbutted him.\n\nOn November 27, Thanksgiving Day, TNA presented the Turkey Bowl. Alex Shelley ended up being pinned by Rhino, and Foley handed Rhino the check. Afterwards, the defeated Shelley had to put on a Turkey Suit in compliance with the match rules, albeit with much refusal. However, Shelley \"flipped off\" Foley and proceeded to beat him up. In the aftermath, Mick mentioned that Shelley is lucky he still has his job. The Main Event Mafia's Kevin Nash, Booker T, and Scott Steiner were going to take on Brother Devon, A.J. Styles, and Mick Foley in his debut matchup at Genesis. Nash, however, suffered a legitimate staph infection and missed Genesis. He was replaced by Cute Kip. Foley got the pin when he hit Scott Steiner with a double arm DDT onto a chair.\n\nOn April 19, 2009 at Lockdown, he defeated Sting to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for his first ever championship in TNA, and his fourth World title overall. Mick did not lose the championship, but Sting became the new leader of the Main Event Mafia by pinning Kurt Angle at Sacrifice. Foley had also stated on \"Impact!\" tapings that if he retained the TNA World Heavyweight Title at the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary, he would only put the title up in a match once a year. However, he lost the title to Kurt Angle in the King of The Mountain match at Slammiversary. He received a rematch at Victory Road, commenting he had only submitted once in his career (to Terry Funk, in a spinning toe hold) and swore he'd never do it again. He lost the match when Angle forced him to submit again with the ankle lock.\n\nOn July 30, 2009, the 200th episode of \"Impact!\", Foley won the TNA Legends Championship by pinning champion Kevin Nash in a tag team match where Nash teamed with Angle and Foley with Bobby Lashley. At Hard Justice Nash defeated Foley to regain the title, following interference from Traci Brooks.\n\nOn the edition of September 24 of \"Impact!\" Foley turned heel again when he attacked Abyss during and after a TNA World Tag Team Championship match against Booker T and Scott Steiner. Foley revealed Abyss as the one who tore up his picture and beat him to a bloody pulp with a video tape and the baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. Abyss then challenged Foley to a Monster's Ball match which Foley accepted. At Bound for Glory Abyss defeated Foley in the match. Two weeks later, Foley turned face by turning on Dr. Stevie and saved Abyss from him. The following week he explained that he had played Dr. Stevie all along and had challenged Abyss to a match at Bound for Glory in order to see how tough he really was. On the edition of November 12 of \"Impact!\" Raven returned to TNA and saved Stevie's future in the company by costing Abyss a match and throwing a fireball in Foley's face.\n\nAfter this, Foley turned his attention away from Abyss and Dr. Stevie and concentrated on Hulk Hogan's arrival in TNA, appearing to be paranoid about Hogan taking over TNA. On the edition of December 3 of \"Impact!\" Foley teased another heel turn by booking face Kurt Angle in a handicap match, after Angle refused to give him information on who Hogan is bringing to TNA. At Final Resolution Abyss and Foley defeated Stevie and Raven in a \"Foley's Funhouse\" tag team match. On January 4, 2010, the day of Hulk Hogan's debut for TNA, Foley was assaulted by the reunited Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and Sean Waltman, when trying to get a meeting with Hogan. On the edition of January 21 of \"Impact!\" new Executive Producer Eric Bischoff fired Foley, after claiming to have been attacked by him. On the edition of February 11 of \"Impact!\", Bischoff and Foley \"talked it over\", as Hogan had suggested two weeks prior, and Foley was entered in the 8 Card Stud Tournament at Against All Odds. The match was a No Disqualification match against Abyss, who won the match and advanced. On the edition of March 15 of \"Impact!\" Bischoff announced that he would be shaving Foley bald as a punishment for trying to help Jeff Jarrett in a handicap match the previous week. At first Foley was seemingly going along with the plan, but at the last second he shoved Mr. Socko down Bischoff's throat, put him on the barber's chair and shaved him nearly bald. On the following edition of \"Impact!\", Foley lost to Jarrett in a No Disqualification Career vs. Career match set up by Bischoff, forcing Foley to kayfabe leave TNA. In reality, Foley was taken off television due to him being on his way to exceed the maximum number of dates per year on his contract, at the pace he was making appearances.\n\nFoley returned to TNA on July 12, 2010, at the tapings of the edition of July 15 of \"Impact!\", leading an invasion of fellow ECW alumni TNA World Heavyweight Champion Rob Van Dam, Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Stevie Richards, Rhino, Brother Devon, Pat Kenney and Al Snow forming the team of EV 2.0. The following week, TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay–per–view event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to the company. At the event Foley refereed a Final Showdown match between Tommy Dreamer and Raven. On the following edition of \"Impact!\", the ECW alumni, known collectively as Extreme, Version 2.0 (EV 2.0), were assaulted by A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, Douglas Williams and Matt Morgan of Ric Flair's stable, who thought they didn't deserve to be in TNA. In August Foley began writing a weekly column for TNA's website. On the October 7, 2010 live edition of \"Impact!\", Foley defeated Ric Flair in a Last Man Standing match. the Last Man Standing match with Flair turned out to be Foley's last match in TNA. At Bound for Glory Foley was in EV 2.0's corner, when Dreamer, Raven, Rhino, Richards and Sabu defeated members Styles, Kazarian, Morgan, Roode and Storm in a Lethal Lockdown match. After not appearing for two months, Foley returned on the edition of December 23 of \"Impact!\", confronting Fortune and Immortal. After Genesis, Foley once again disappeared from TNA television, but kept making regular appearances at TNA house shows. At the tapings of the edition of May 12 of \"Impact!\", Foley made his return to TV as he was revealed as the \"Network\" consultant, who had been causing problems for Immortal for the past months. On May 23, Foley, who had expressed frustration with TNA and said that he did not plan to renew his contract with the promotion once it would expire in the fall of 2011, made a joke on Twitter, comparing his Empty Arena match with The Rock to a TNA house show. On the following edition of \"Impact Wrestling\" on June 2, Hulk Hogan announced that Foley had been fired as the Network Executive. This was done to write Foley, who had asked for his release from TNA, off television. His departure from the promotion was confirmed on June 5, 2011.\n\nFoley returned to WWE at a house show in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, taking a break from his UK comedy tour, on November 2, 2011, making an in-ring promo with The Miz and R-Truth and then guest refereed the tag team match, appearing again in Manchester on November 5. Foley returned to \"Raw\" on November 14, which featured him presenting a \"This is Your Life\" celebration for John Cena (he presented a similar segment for The Rock 12 years earlier). Among those brought out were Cena's former tag team partner Bull Buchanan, his former baseball coach (kayfabe), and his father; however the segment was interrupted by The Rock, who delivered a Rock Bottom to Foley before leaving the ring, ending the segment. Foley was the special guest host on the live edition of \"Smackdown\" on November 29.\n\nFoley appeared on \"Raw\" on the January 16, 2012, episode to announce his intentions to participate in the Royal Rumble match at the 2012 Royal Rumble pay-per-view later in the night during a six-man tag team match CM Punk needing a tag Foley came down to the ring and got tagged in the match; he defeated David Otunga but John Laurinaitis reversed the decision because Foley was not an official participant of the match. The next week, he also appeared, wishing Zack Ryder good luck in his match against Kane that night. Foley participated in the Royal Rumble match at the 2012 Royal Rumble pay-per-view where he entered at number 7 and eliminated Justin Gabriel (with the help of Ricardo Rodriguez), Epico, and Primo, eventually being eliminated by Cody Rhodes after 06:34 this was Foley's last night as an active wrestler. Foley later appeared in a segment alongside Santino Marella during WrestleMania XXVIII. On April 10, 2012, Foley made an appearance on \"WWE SmackDown: Blast from the Past\". He returned to \"Raw\" on June 18, 2012, announcing that he would be serving as the temporary general manager of both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" for the week.

In 2012 he hosted the \"WWE: Falls Count Anywhere – The Greatest Street Fights and other Out of Control Matches\" DVD. On the September 24, 2012 episode of \"Raw\", Foley made an appearance to confront CM Punk, telling him to accept a match against John Cena. Later in the show, however, Punk attacked Foley backstage. At Hell in a Cell, CM Punk successfully retained his WWE Championship against Ryback due to interference from the referee, Brad Maddox. The next day on \"Raw\", CM Punk announced he would be facing Team Foley at Survivor Series in a traditional Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination match for which Foley had accepted the challenge. However Punk had been removed from the match the following week. On the November 12, 2012 episode of \"Raw\", Foley was appointed the Special Guest Enforcer in the match between CM Punk and John Cena.

However, he managed to recover later in the night and help Cena defeat Del Rio in a Miracle on 34th Street Fight.\n\nIn August 2012, Foley was originally scheduled to have a match with the debuting Dean Ambrose at SummerSlam. However, doctors were not able to medically clear Foley and thus Foley announced his final retirement from in-ring competition.\n\nOn January 11, 2013 WWE.com announced that Foley would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2013 by his longtime friend Terry Funk. The official announcement was made on the 20th Anniversary of \"Raw\" on January 14. At the February 26 taping of \"Saturday Morning Slam\" (that aired March 16), Foley was named as the new general manager for the show.

Throughout December 2014, Foley appeared in segments on \"Raw\" as Saint Mick alongside his daughter Noelle. In 2015, Foley appeared at SummerSlam, where he kicked off the event with host Jon Stewart. Foley returned to \"Raw\" on March 14, 2016 in a backstage segment with Dean Ambrose, in which he gave him a pep talk for his upcoming WrestleMania 32 match against Brock Lesnar and a passing of the torch in the form of his iconic barbed wire baseball bat, \"Barbie\". On April 3, 2016 at WrestleMania 32, Foley returned in-ring alongside Shawn Michaels and Stone Cold Steve Austin in a post-match interruption where the trio of Hall of Famers took on The League of Nations after they had defeated The New Day and proclaimed \"No three people can ever defeat us.\" Foley brought out Mr. Socko and executed the Mandible Claw two times during the fight, once on Sheamus and once on King Barrett. The latter was part of a three-way finishing move sequence where Barrett was first hit with Sweet Chin Music by Shawn Michaels, staggered and fell into Mr. Socko, and finally hit with a Stone Cold Stunner.\n\nOn the July 18, 2016 episode of \"Raw\", Foley was appointed by Stephanie McMahon as the General Manager of Raw. Foley has since unveiled new titles exclusive to the Raw brand, while also making fair decisions to favor the fan favorites and occasionally disagreeing with Stephanie McMahon. One of Foley's first decisions as Raw General Manager was pitting the feuding Sheamus and Cesaro against one another in a Best of 7 series. Going into Clash of Champions the duo were tied 3-3. At Clash of Champions, both men would be counted out resulting in a draw and the best of seven series being declared a draw. On the next night's episode of \"Raw\" Foley who had promised the victor a championship opportunity would put the two in a tag team.

On the December 12 episode of \"Raw\", Zayn would once again ask for a rematch with Strowman, but was once again rejected by Foley. Zayn would then tell Foley he was pondering going to \"SmackDown\" because Foley did not believe in him. Later that night, after Zayn defeated Jinder Mahal, Foley would tell him he has arranged a trade with \"SmackDown\" for him in exchange for Eva Marie. Zayn would angrily refuse the trade and once again demanded a rematch with Strowman. Foley would yield, giving Zayn his match with Strowman at with a ten-minute time limit.\n\nOn the March 13, 2017 episode of \"Raw\", Stephanie McMahon forced Foley to fire a member of the \"Raw\" roster by the end of the night. Foley chose to fire Stephanie McMahon herself, which prompted Triple H to come out and confront Foley. After being insulted and ordered to leave the ring, Foley instead attacked Triple H, stuffing a sock in Triple H's mouth via \"Mr. Socko\" before being low blowed by McMahon. Seth Rollins would then come out to aid Foley, only to be attacked by Triple H. On the March 20 episode of \"Raw\", Stephanie McMahon would fire Foley for his actions the previous week. A few weeks later Foley made an appearance at the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2017 ceremony.\n\nOn the September 10, 2018 episode of \"Raw\".

Following the show, a Mick Foley 20 Years of Hell special was aired on the WWE Network.\n\nFoley is a multi-time \"New York Times\" bestselling author, particularly known for his ongoing series of memoirs. His writing has generally received favorable reviews.\n\nFrom May 7 to July 1, 1999, Foley wrote his autobiography — without the aid of a ghostwriter, as he noted in the introduction — in almost 800 pages of longhand. The book, \"\" was released on October 31, 1999 and topped \"The New York Times\"' non-fiction bestseller list for several weeks. The follow-up, \"Foley Is Good: And the Real World Is Faker than Wrestling\", was released on May 8, 2001.\n\nThe third part of his autobiography, \"The Hardcore Diaries\", highlights his 2004 feud with Randy Orton, his match and later partnership with Edge, and program with Ric Flair in 2006. \"The Hardcore Diaries\" was released on March 6, 2007 also spent time on the New York Times bestseller list. Foley's \"Countdown to Lockdown\" was released on October 1, 2010. On September 30, 2010, Joey Styles interviewed Foley on WWE.com – even though Foley was under contract with TNA – about his new book, while Michael Cole plugged the book on the edition of September 27 of \"Raw\" and a piece was published by Foley in \"Slate\" of which portions were adapted from \"Countdown\". WWE's promotion of a product released by an employee of a rival company was a quite unusual move and a welcome surprise for Foley, who has since stated that he was delighted at the respect shown by his former employer. On November 10, 2010, Foley appeared on \"The Daily Show\" and \"Off the Record\" to discuss the book and his charity work. \"Countdown to Lockdown\" became Foley's first memoir to not make the \"New York Times\" bestseller list.\n\nHis fifth autobiography, Saint Mick, was released on October 17, 2017.\n\nFoley has also written four children's books, \"Mick Foley's Halloween Hijinx\", \"Mick Foley's Christmas Chaos\", \"Tales from Wrescal Lane\" and \"A Most Mizerable Christmas\", in addition to two novels: \"Tietam Brown\", a coming-of-age story which was nominated for the WHSmith People's Choice Award in 2004 and \"Scooter\", was published in August 2005.\n\n\nOne of Foley's earliest acting roles was in 1996. Shortly before he left for Stamford, Foley appeared in Atlanta filmmakers Barry Norman and Michael Williams' short subject \"Deadbeats\" as \"Bird\", an armed robber turned debt collector. One of Foley's first TV guest appearances was as a wrestler on USA Network's short-lived action-comedy \"G vs E\". He also featured prominently in the documentary \"Beyond the Mat\". As Mankind, he also starred in a series of commercials for Chef Boyardee's beef ravioli. He appeared in the Insane Clown Posse vehicle \"Big Money Hustlas\" as Cactus Sac, which was basically the same character as his Cactus Jack persona.\n\nIn late 2001, Foley hosted a series of \"Robot Wars\" dubbed \"Extreme Warriors.\" He also provided a guest voice for two episodes of the Nickelodeon animated series \"\", in which he portrayed a satirical earthbending wrestler named the Boulder, and provided the voice for Gorrath in the pilot episode of \"Megas XLR\". Foley appeared in an episode of \"Boy Meets World\" as Mankind, giving advice to Eric Matthews before giving Eric the mandible claw and an airplane spin. Foley was also a voice in an episode of \"Celebrity Deathmatch\" where he was an animated version of Mankind doing a stunt from the ceiling, and later in the same episode he fought and defeated Ernest Hemingway. Foley also had a small role in the 2007 thriller movie \"Anamorph\" starring Willem Dafoe.\n\nFoley has frequently appeared on Air America Radio's \"Morning Sedition\", including several stints as a guest host and has appeared on \"The Rachel Maddow Show\". He also hosted WWE's radio show. Foley also occasionally appears on the \"Opie and Anthony Show\". He appeared in the 2009 wrestling documentary, \"Bloodstained Memoirs\".\n\nIn 2009, Foley had a guest voice appearance on Adult Swim show \"Squidbillies\" as Thunder Clap, a former pro-wrestler (strongly resembling Hulk Hogan in appearance and speech), who had recently gone through some tough times, during the Season 4 episode \"Anabolic-holic\". On August 22, 2009, Foley made his stand-up debut at The Improv in Los Angeles. The event was billed the \"Total Xtreme Comedy show\" and also featured comedians Brad Williams, Bret Ernst and Ring of Honor's Colt Cabana, who was also making his stand-up debut. The money Foley made from the event went to Wrestler's Rescue, which creates awareness and helps raise money to support the health care needs of retired professional wrestlers. In October 2009, Foley was guest DJ on E Street Radio, a Satellite radio station dedicated to the music of Bruce Springsteen.\n\nOn November 19, 2009 Foley made his first appearance on \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\". Deemed the \"Senior Ass Kicker\", Foley defended the pro-gay rights views of Will Phillips. He showed up again on March 15, 2010 to help correspondent Wyatt Cenac compare politics to pro wrestling, giving speeches for and against the use of the filibuster. Due to his charitable work and for standing up for Will Phillips, Foley was awarded a \"Medal of Reasonableness\" by Jon Stewart at the 2010 Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. On June 18, 2013, Mick Foley again appeared on the Daily Show now hosted by temporary host John Oliver. On this appearance, he defended immigration reform in response to the WWE's character Zeb Colter's comments on the June 17 episode of Raw.\n\nIn mid-2010, Foley has appeared on Chicago Comic Con, where he had his own booth promoting TNA. He was also interviewed by Victory Records, mentioning his interest in Swedish hard rock band Sister Sin.\n\nOn September 27, 2010, it was announced that Union Square Agency and American Original would be producing a feature film based on Foley's life.\n\nIn November 2010 Foley was a contestant on an all TNA week of \"Family Feud\", teaming with Jay Lethal, Matt Morgan, Mr. Anderson and Rob Van Dam against Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Lacey Von Erich, Tara and Velvet Sky.\n\nFoley and his family appeared on ABC's \"Celebrity Wife Swap\" on January 31, 2012. His wife Colette traded places on the show with Antonio Sabàto, Jr.'s fiancé, Cheryl Moana Marie Nunes.\n\nFoley appeared in a CollegeHumor video entitled \"Mick Foley Mystery\" as himself.\n\nIn 2014, a documentary starring Foley was released by Virgil Films entitled, \"I Am Santa Claus\". The film was produced by Foley and Morgan Spurlock. It chronicles the lives of members of the Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas.\n\nMuch of Foley's charitable work revolves around children. Among his involvement, Foley has participated in numerous Make-a-Wish Foundation events, has made surprise visits to children in hospitals, and has visited schools and libraries to talk to students about the value of education and the importance of reading. Foley sponsors seven children with ChildFund International (formerly Christian Children's Fund), a group he has been affiliated with since 1992. In recent years, he has become one of the fund's leading donors, helping fund childhood education centers in the remote areas of the Philippines and Mexico, as well as four small community schools in the West African nation of Sierra Leone. After visiting the country in November 2008, an experience he called \"one of the best experiences of my life; maybe the best,\" Foley committed to funding a larger primary school, which was completed in September 2009.\n\nFoley has visited U.S. troops at various military bases and military hospitals. For several years Foley visited wounded soldiers at Washington D.C.-based military hospitals on almost a monthly basis, becoming known as a \"Legend among hurt troops,\" according to a \"Washington Times\" article.\n\nHaving become a devoted fan of Tori Amos' music in 1993, (particularly the song \"Winter\" from the \"Little Earthquakes\" album), and following a meeting with Amos at the 2008 San Diego Comic Con, Foley became involved with the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), a group Amos co-founded in 1994. Since then, he has worked as a volunteer on their online hotline and as a member of their National Leadership Council. During a 15-month period ending in April 2011, Foley logged more than 550 hours talking to victims online. The same month, Foley offered to mow anyone's lawn who donated at least $5,000 to the organization, stating, \"If you want to help survivors of sexual assault, or just want to see a big guy with long hair mowing your lawn in front of your friends, please take part...\"\n\nContinuing his campaign for the organization, in May 2011 Foley auctioned off on eBay two famous items associated with his wrestling career: his Cactus Jack lace-up \"leopard skin\" boots (still embedded with 149 thumbtacks from his \"Impact\" match with Ric Flair); and the white shirt that he wore as Mankind during 1998's \"Hell in a Cell\" match, among other items.\n\nFoley has been outspoken in his support for the Democratic Party. During the 2004 election cycle, Foley argued the Democratic point of view in a WWE-sponsored debate against John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, who spoke for the Republican side. He was a contributor to Barack Obama's campaign for the U.S. presidency in 2008.\n\nFoley and his wife Colette (née Christie) have three sons and a daughter: Dewey Francis (born February 20, 1992), Noelle Margaret (born December 15, 1993), Michael Francis \"Mickey\" Jr. (born in 2001), and Hughie Francis (born in 2003). Foley's father, Jack Foley, a former Ward Melville High School Athletic Director, died on September 13, 2009. As of June 2018, Dewey works for WWE.\n\nHis son Mickey is on the autism spectrum. Foley's sons Mickey and Hughie operate their own YouTube channel, \"MickeyFoley0105\". The page depicts Mickey wrestling on a trampoline with his brother, and video games and other aspects of his life. Foley himself occasionally appears in Mickey's videos, including one parodying the 2010 LeBron James special \"The Decision\" in which Foley teases announcing Al Snow as being his WWE Hall of Fame inductee before announcing the real inductee, Terry Funk.\n\nFoley is a longtime fan of women's professional wrestling and has campaigned for their equality among men. Among his closest friends in WWE have long been their female performers, with Trish Stratus calling Foley the Divas' \"safety valve\" since, due to Foley being married, he was one of the few wrestlers who would not try to date his coworkers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

NBench is written in C, and was initially focused on PCs running the Microsoft Windows operating system. Independently of BYTE, in 1996 NBench was ported to Linux and other flavors of Unix by Uwe F. Mayer.\nMore recently Ludovic Drolez prepared an NBench App for the Android mobile device operating system.\nNBench should not be confused with the similarly named but unrelated AMD N-Bench.\n\nThe NBench algorithm suite consists of ten different tasks:\n\nA run of the benchmark suite consists essentially of two phases for each of the tests. First, a calibration loop is run to determine the size of the problem the system can handle in a reasonable time, in order to adapt to the ever-faster computer hardware available. Second, the actual test is run repeatedly several times to obtain a statistically meaningful result.\n\nOriginally, NBench and BYTEmark produced two overall index figures: Integer index and Floating-point index. The Integer index is the geometric mean of those tests that involve only integer processing—numeric sort, string sort, bitfield, emulated floating-point, assignment, Huffman, and IDEA—while the Floating-point index is the geometric mean of those tests that require the floating-point coprocessor—Fourier, neural net, and LU decomposition. The index figures where relative scores to get a general feel for the performance of the machine under test as compared to a baseline system based on a 90 MHz Pentium Intel CPU.\n\nThe Linux/Unix port has a second baseline machine, it is an AMD K6/233 with 32 MB RAM and 512 KB L2-cache running Linux 2.0.32 and using GNU gcc version 2.7.2.3 and libc-5.4.38. The original integer index was split into an integer-operation and a memory-operation index, as suggested by Andrew D. Balsa, reflecting the realization that memory management is important in CPU design. The original tests have been left alone, however, the geometric mean of the tests numeric sort, floating-point emulation, IDEA, and Huffman now constitutes the integer-arithmetic focused benchmark index, while the geometric mean of the tests string sort, bitfield, and assignment makes up the new memory index. The floating point index has been left alone, it is still the geometric mean of fourier, neural net, and LU decomposition.\n\nThe benchmark suite has seen consistent use since the mid-1990s by the personal computing community, on PCs and other devices running various flavors of UNIX including Linux or BSD, or running Windows (usually in combination with Cygwin), and on also on Macs (it is in particular available as a Darwin port).\nA results page from runs on many different hardware configurations, from high-powered multi-CPU servers down to low-powered network switches, is maintained by the original porter.\n\nUsing NBench as a benchmark has pitfalls: \n\n"}

The focus is on the post-World War II era and on left of center, conspiracy theory, and espionage activities.\n\nFounder Daniel Brandt began collecting clippings and citations pertaining to influential people and intelligence agents in the 1960s and especially in the 1970s after becoming a member of Students for a Democratic Society, an organization that opposed US foreign policy. With the advent of personal computing, he developed a database which allowed subscribers to access the names of US intelligence agents.\n\nIn the 1980s, through his company Micro Associates, he sold subscriptions to this computerized database under its original name, Public Information Research, Inc (PIR). At PIR's onset, Brandt was President of the newly formed non-profit corporation, and investigative researcher Peggy Adler served as its Vice President. The material was described as \"information on all sorts of spooks, military officials, political operators and other cloak-and-dagger types\". He told \"The New York Times\" at the time that \"many of these sources are fairly obscure so it's a very effective way to retrieve information on U.S. intelligence that no one else indexes.\" One research librarian calls it \"a unique part of the 'Deep Web'\", equally useful to investigative journalists and students.\n\nBy 1992, private citizens, news organizations, and universities were all using NameBase. With the advent of public access to the Internet and World Wide Web in the 1990s these efforts became the basis of the NameBase website starting in 1995. , the database contained \"over 100,000 names with over 260,000 citations drawn from books and serials with a few documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.\" The website utilizes hyperlinks to allow users to both visualize relationships in a social network diagram and access diagrams and links of those who appear on it. These linkages, diagrams, and hyperlinked footnoted information allow users to uncover potential relationships or connections between individuals and groups. NameBase was described by information scientist Paul B. Kantor as being the \"only web-based tool readily available for visualizing social networks of terrorism researchers.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "344870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=344870", "title": "Need for power", "text": "Need for power\n\nNeed for power (nPow) is a term that was popularized by renowned psychologist David McClelland in 1961. McClelland's thinking was influenced by the pioneering work of Henry Murray, who first identified underlying psychological human needs and motivational processes (1938). It was Murray who set out a taxonomy of needs, including needs for achievement, power, and affiliation—and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model. McClelland was inspired by Murray's research, and he continued to further develop Murray's theory by focusing on this theory in regard to the human population. In McClelland's book \"The Achieving Society\", A-Pow helps explain an individual's imperative to be in charge. According to his work there are two kinds of power, \"social\" and \"personal\".\n\nHenry Murray was one of the first psychologists to systematically investigate human needs. In his 1938 book, \"Explorations in Human Personality\", he identified and labeled twenty needs he believed were universal in nature for all humans. Later research demonstrated that Murray's system of needs positively correlates with the Big Five personality traits.\n\nIn the 1960s, psychologist David McClelland expanded on Murray's work, focusing on the effects of human needs in a work environment. His need theory proposes that most people are consistently motivated by one of three basic desires: the need for affiliation, the need for achievement, or the need for power.\n\nTo determine how strongly an individual felt each of the three needs, McClelland used the thematic apperception test (TAT), which is designed to uncover a person's unconscious drives, emotions, wants and needs. During the test, a psychologist shows an individual a series of picture cards depicting ambiguous situations and asks them to tell a story about each image. The psychologist then interprets those stories to identify desires or personality traits the individual may be are unaware of or want to hide. Several empirical studies have demonstrated that the TAT cannot detect mental illness at a rate higher than chance, and the inter-rater validity as measured by Cronbach's alpha (the likelihood of two psychologists providing similar interpretations of the same person's results) is low, especially if the clinician gives a subjective interpretation instead of using the test's original scoring system. However, proponents of the TAT argue that Cronbach's alpha is artificially low for tests with a small number of items, and that the TAT provides a more detailed and flexible description of an individual than a structured questionnaire.\n\nMcClelland defines the need for power (nPow) as a desire for \"power either to control other people (for <nowiki>[one's]</nowiki> own goals) or to achieve higher goals (for the greater good),\" and describes people high in this trait as seeking \"neither recognition nor approval from others - only agreement and compliance.\". In his later research, McClelland refined his theory to include two distinct types of power motivation: the need for \"socialized power\", expressed on the TAT by descriptions of plans, self-doubts, mixed outcomes, and concern for others, and the need for \"personal power\", expressed by stories in which one individual seeks power and must oppose another to get it. Compared to people who value affiliation or achievement, individuals with high nPow scores tend to be more argumentative, more assertive in group discussions, and more likely to experience frustration when they feel powerless or not in control of a situation. They are more likely to seek or hold a position in which they have control over others, and to engage in conspicuous consumption.\n\nA high nPow score predicts greater career success for men and for women who report high satisfaction with the power-related aspects of their workplace. McClelland's own research included case studies illustrating the advantage of high nPow in the workplace, especially for more experienced workers competing for management positions. In one characteristic example, a successful salesman with a high need for affiliation and a low need for power began to perform poorly after being promoted to management. He experienced difficulty giving direct orders, leading his subordinates to complain that he failed to set clear goals and reward individuals who performed well.\n\nOutside of work, a high nPow score is associated with both positive and negative outcomes, with the result often depending on whether an individual also reports a strong sense of responsibility. When combined with a low score on a measure of responsibility, a high nPow score predicts higher rates of externalizing self-destructive behavior, such as binge-drinking and physical aggression. Men with this combination of personality traits are more likely to divorce, separate, or physically abuse their spouses. However, this association disappears for individuals with average or high responsibility scores, who are disproportionately likely to report positive outcomes like taking on social leadership roles.\n\nAs with individual outcomes, whether a high need for power results in positive or negative outcomes is influenced by the individual's other traits, particularly responsibility and empathy. An argumentative group member may prevent groupthink, or they may intimidate other group members and refuse to make reasonable compromises; a hard-charging manager may motivate and focus their team, or they may bully and manipulate their subordinates. Even dangerous behaviors, like impulsive risk-taking, can be beneficial in moderation: successful stock traders and entrepreneurs often have a high propensity for risk.\n\nOn average, men report a higher need for power than women, which may be due to biological factors, social factors, or an interaction between them. Gender also influences how the need for power is outwardly expressed: men are more likely to express anger directly, use physical violence to establish control, or engage in risky or impulsive behavior, while women are more likely to employ relational aggression or suppress their hostility. When the needs for socialized and personal power are measured separately, women managers express a greater desire for socialized power than their male counterparts, but an equal desire for personal power. Men, but not women, reported greater job satisfaction if they had a high need for socialized power.\n\nMurray defined need for achievement as the attempt to overcome obstacles. Need for achievement (nAch) was defined by McClelland as the motive to strive for success in particular situations in which his/her performance would be looked at against some type of standard. McClelland used the thematic apperception test in order to test this part of his theory. He would show people four pictures and ask people to write a story regarding these pictures. Based on his/her story, McClelland would be able to determine what type of achievement a person strived.\n\nMurray believed need for affiliation was a trait that was very strong in most people, especially in stressful situations. Murray believed that when people were put into a stressful situation, people were more likely to feel less stress if another person was present. In McClelland's research, he found that people who had need for affiliation were often unpopular tried to avoid interpersonal conflicts because they have levels of anxiety about if others will accept them.\n\n"}

The archive was launched on 31 July 2014, following the completion of a three-year process whereby the New Zealand Film Archive \"absorbed\" the collections and operations of the RNZ Sound Archives Ngā Taonga Kōrero in 2012 and the Television New Zealand Archive in 2014.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision identifies itself as New Zealand's audiovisual archive, with a purpose of collecting, sharing and caring for New Zealand's audiovisual taonga.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision is an independent Charitable Trust (CC22250). It identifies itself as a Tier 2 public benefit entity (PBE). It was originally called The New Zealand Film Archive, incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 on 9 March 1981. The name was changed to The New Zealand Archive of Film, Television and Sound Ngā Taonga Whitiāhua Me Ngā Taonga Kōrero, effective 1 July 2014. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's new name was officially launched by the Minister for Broadcasting Craig Foss on 31 July 2014.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision retained the Constitution and Kaupapa of The New Zealand Film Archive when it was founded in 2014.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision adopted its bicultural framework from the New Zealand Film Archive when the new archive was established in mid-2014.\n\nThe Archive identifies itself as a bicultural organisation that upholds the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in its policies and practices. The Treaty is part of the Archive's Kaupapa, which in turn is part of the archive's Constitution. At all times there are three people on the Board of Trustees that represent Māori interests \"through their own heritage and/or their connections with iwi and iwi interests.\"\n\nHowever Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in mid-2016, noted that the term bi-culturalism allowed archive staff to opt-out of kaupapa-centred activities. Even the term kaupapa-centred was largely undefined. Staff had limited knowledge of mana whenua histories and significant places. Both non-Māori and Māori staff felt culturally unsafe at the archive, with organisational policies and procedures not reflecting a kaupapa-centred approach.\n\nIn May 2016 the Board of Trustees retired the Board's Bicultural Committee and resolved that the Chief Executive would report to the Board on matters relating to the kaupapa of the organisation.\n\nThe Taha Māori working group within Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision was developed during the 2012-2014 transformation process. Specialist Māori language and programme staff were seconded to a working group to develop Taha Māori programming and activities within the archive.\n\nThe major operational restructure of the Archive in 2014 saw the establishment of the Taha Māori department to \"address the needs of Māori collections and users\". The department saw rapid growth, with expenditure rising from $54,257 in 2013/14 to $413,692 in 2014/15. However, in July 2016 an operational restructure saw the disestablishment of the Taha Māori department, with its staff split and absorbed into other departments.\n\nAt the time of publication in mid-2016, Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's Strategic Plan 2016-2014 noted that there was no work programme to address relationships with iwi and Māori. The archive had eight expired Memoranda of Understanding with various iwi, and little connection with urban Māori. The archive didn't engage with Māori audiences and used English as its primary language for on and off-line services, with only elements of Te Reo.\n\nAfter becoming Governor-General of New Zealand in September 2016, Dame Patsy Reddy took on the role of Patron of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision. In the late 1980s Dame Patsy was the Chair of the New Zealand Film Archive's Board of Trustees. Later she became the Chair of the New Zealand Film Commission.\n\nThe Board of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision is composed of six Trustees. Each Trustee can be on the Board for a maximum of 2 three-year terms. The Trustees can also co-opt other people onto the Board as needed. Trustees are paid an honoraria of $10,000 each annually. The Chair is also paid an additional $10,000 annually. The Chair must be a current Trustee and is appointed by the Board on an annual basis. Even though Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision is largely a tax-payer funded organisation, it is not a Crown entity and the Board is solely responsible for identifying and appointing Trustees.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision's founding Chair of the Board of Trustees was Jane Kominik.\nMs Kominik was previously the Chair of The New Zealand Film Archive. She had earlier been Deputy Chief Executive of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage when it was established in 1991. Ms Kominik's term as Chair of Ngā Taonga ended on 30 June 2017. In February 2018 current Chair Simon Murdoch reflected on Ms Kominik's time leading the archive \"Her wise and steady leadership during a time of such dramatic change always inspired confidence that the organisation was heading in the right direction.\"\n\nSimon Murdoch was appointed Chair in mid-2017. Mr Murdoch also sits on the Performance & Appointments Committee and the Property & Fundraising Committee. Prior to his involvement with the archive, Mr Murdoch was in the media spotlight as head of the Government Communications Security Bureau, presiding over the illegal surveillance of Kim Dotcom.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision's founding Board of Trustees were all previous Trustees of The New Zealand Film Archive. The founding Trustees were Louise Baker, Derek Fox, Judith Fyfe, Jane Kominik, Morris Love and Nathan Hoturoa Gray.\n\nIn 2015 Nathan Hoturoa Gray ceased being a Trustee and was replaced by Edie Te Hunapo Moke. In 2016 Louise Baker and Morris Love ceased being Trustees and were replaced by Simon Murdoch and Peter Tematakahere Douglas. In 2017 Peter Tematakahere Douglas and Derek Fox ceased being Trustees and were replaced by Te Raumawhitu Kupenga and Lisa Bates (co-opted to assist with fundraising). In October 2017 Whetu Fala became a Trustee to \"represent Māori interests\", and in December Jane Kominik and Judith Fyfe ceased being Trustees. In January 2018 Emily Loughnan and Lisa Bates became Trustees.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision's founding Chief Executive Officer was Frank Stark. After twenty-two years of being Chief Executive of the New Zealand Film Archive, and then latterly the Chief Executive of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision he resigned in February 2015. Huia Kopua became the Acting Chief Executive during the first months of 2015. Ms Kopua also held the role of Pou Ārahi Deputy Chief Executive.\n\nRebecca Elvy was seconded from the Ministry of Education and appointed Acting Chief Executive on 2 March 2015. Before her appointment, Ms Elvy was Associate Deputy Secretary, Education Payroll Services at the Ministry of Education and often appeared in the media when issues with Novopay made the news. Ms Elvy was appointed as Chief Executive for a five-year term beginning 1 May 2015. Ms Elvy also operates a management website to \"help people lead inspired, intentional, impactful lives, so that we can change the world for the better.\"\n\nThe founding leadership team at Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision in 2014 were the leadership team from the New Zealand Film Archive. The team included Sarah Davy (Operations), Jamie Lean (Standards), Huia Kopua (Deputy Chief Executive), Karen Neill (Partnership), Diane Pivac (Audience) and Frank Stark (Chief Executive Officer). Prior to the RNZ Sound Archive amalgamation in 2012, Karen Neill was head of RNZ Sound Archives, and between 1 October 2012 - 1 July 2014 was Director Radio at The New Zealand Film Archive.\n\nIn 2015 the leadership team included Sarah Davy (Operations), Rebecca Elvy (Chief Executive Officer), Jamie Lean (Standards), Huia Kopua (Pou Ārahi Deputy Chief Executive), Karen Neill (Partnership) and Diane Pivac (Audience).\n\nIn 2016 the leadership team included Sarah Davy (Operations/Information Services), Rebecca Elvy (Chief Executive Officer), Jamie Lean (Standards/Collection Services), Honiana Love (Pou Ārahi – Strategic Advisor, Māori), Charlotte McInnes (Chief Operating Officer), Karen Neill (Partnership), Hohepa Patea (Taha Māori) and Diane Pivac (Audience).\n\nIn 2017 the leadership team included Sarah Davy (Information Services), Rebecca Elvy (Chief Executive Officer), Jamie Lean (Collection Services), Honiana Love (Pou Ārahi – Strategic Advisor, Māori), Jackie Hay (Outreach and Engagement) and Charlotte McInnes (Chief Operating Officer).\n\nThe employee figures below were sourced from the annual returns Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision files with Charities Services under the Charities Act 2005. Figures prior to the 2014/15 financial year represent employee numbers of The New Zealand Film Archive and are included for reference purposes.\nIn November 2017 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision supplied the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage with the following figures: by 2010 approximately 50 FTE (full-time equivalent), 2012 saw an increase of 10 FTE with the absorption of the RNZ Sound Archives, 2014 saw an increase of 11 FTE with the absorption of the TVNZ Archive.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision noted that once ongoing funding commenced in 2014 there were 61.6 FTE positions. However the Archive's annual report in 2014/15 noted that it had 80 staff, and in its briefing to the incoming Minister in 2014 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision said that it had 75 staff - 47 in Wellington, 12 in Christchurch, 4 in Auckland, and 12 at Avalon.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision surveys employee engagement annually.\nIn October 2017 the Board discussed the employee engagement survey and sought the Chief Executive's commitment to meaningful action planning and activity.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision's Strategic Plan 2016-2014 published in mid-2016 summarised employee-related issues. These included an aging workforce with low turnover and minimal knowledge management; employees not empowered to use their own initiative; a scattergun approach to professional development and employees not supported because of poor processes. The archive also noted that it was not actively monitoring the mental, physical, emotional and spiritual well-being of staff.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision's kaupapa calls for the Archive to \"maintain and defend its own professional integrity, independence and judgment in its role as a publicly accountable body\". On 12 July 2016 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision launched its Strategic Plan 2016-2024. Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision Jane Kominik said it was \"the result of much honest self-appraisal\".\n\nThe Strategic Plan not only set out \"an ambitious direction and challenging goals\", but also clearly documented \"a range of factors that create real challenges for us and our clients\". This included highlighting ongoing issues with the integration between the three archives, issues with management, iwi engagement, buildings, clients, work processes, diversity of audiences, education activities and a heavy reliance on government funding.\n\nFor two years, from October 2014 to October 2016 the Board of Trustees published a report of each Board meeting online. From December 2016 only summaries are published.\n\nIn November 2016, opposition MP Jacinda Ardern questioned the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry over whether she considered it satisfactory that Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision, a private trust, be \"not answerable in any formal or legal way to the people of New Zealand except through temporary funding contracts.\" Ms Ardern was told that Ngā Taonga was accountable through its agreement with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. Ms Ardern also asked Ms Barry if she had \"considered turning Ngā Taonga into a crown entity; if not, why not?\" Ms Barry replied that \"no, the current arrangements are working well.\" Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision itself says it is \"accountable to all New Zealanders as it collects and cares for audiovisual taonga on their behalf.\"\n\nIn June 2018, Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin and the Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Grant Robertson announced a National Archival and Library Institutions Ministerial Group. As part of its remit, the group will \"investigate options for ensuring Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision has appropriate governance, and a sustainable structure and funding (this will include a consideration of whether Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision should be established as a Crown entity)\". The working group includes Internal Affairs Minister Tracey Martin, Associate Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Grant Robertson, Minister of State Services Chris Hipkins, Minister for Māori Development Nanaia Mahuta and the Minister for Government Digital Services and Associate Minister of State Services Clare Curran. The group is due to report back to Cabinet by the end of 2018.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision has signed agreements, or is made reference to in agreements with various external agencies including Government departments and independent Charitable Trusts. These include:\n\n\nAt February 2017, Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision was a member of the following associations: Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA), Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC), Fédération Internationale des Archives du Film (FIAF), Fédération Internationale des Archives du Television (FIAT), International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA) and the South East Asia and Pacific Audio-Visual Archives Association (SEAPAVAA).\n\nPreviously Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision had been a member of the following associations, but their current membership status is unknown: Archives and Records Association of New Zealand (ARANZ), Australasian Sound Recordings Association (ASRA) and the National Oral History Association of New Zealand (NOHANZ).\n\nDuring Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's restructure in 2016 the Association of Moving Image Archivists and the Archives and Records Association of New Zealand raised formal concerns with the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry, opposition MP Jacinda Ardern and Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision.\n\nBetween November 2012 and April 2014 the New Zealand Film Archive undertook a major review of its governance, structure and capability at the request of the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Chris Finlayson. This followed the transfer of the RNZ Sound Archive in October 2012, and the upcoming transfer of the TVNZ Archive on 1 August 2014.\n\nChair of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision Jane Kominik noted that it had been almost two years of review and rebuilding. The result was a new constitution, a new way of electing board members and a new operational structure. The new structure came into effect on 1 July 2014 and became the founding structure of Ngā Taonga.\n\nThe long-standing function based structure of \"collect, protect and connect\" employed by the archive was replaced with a structure that put the Treaty of Waitangi partnership at its centre. As part of this, the Taha Māori department was established. The new structure aimed to be audience-focused, standards-based, collaborative and provide value for money.\n\nNotably, the Radio Division (i.e. the former RNZ Sound Archive) and the senior management role of Director Radio was disestablished by the restructure, less than two years after the RNZ Sound Archive amalgamation. Radio Division staff were split and absorbed into the newly created departments.\n\nAt 1 August 2014, apart from Karen Neill (Head of Partnerships and former Director Radio), there were no former TVNZ Archive or RNZ Sound Archive staff employed in a management capacity within Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision.\n\nThe 2013/14 Annual Report noted \"the successful completion of the process to bring together the management and operations of the Film Archive and the Sound Archives.\" Chief Executive Officer Frank Stark resigned from the archive in February 2015 and was replaced by Rebecca Elvy in March. Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision Jane Kominik noted in the 2014/15 Annual Report that the challenge ahead for the archive was to \"retain the integrity of the constituent collections whilst providing integrated services and access.\"\n\nThe staff and collections of the TVNZ Archive were amalgamated with Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision in August 2014. In 2015 Ngā Taonga restructured the former TVNZ Archive staff, and then in July 2016 Ngā Taonga changed its operational structure. The restructure saw the departure of two members of the leadership team and the disestablishment of the Taha Māori group, with its staff split and absorbed into the newly created departments.\n\nThe 2016/17 staff restructure followed on from the operational restructure of July 2016.\n\nThe restructure proposal was announced to Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision staff on 7 November 2016. It was labeled by the archive as the first significant change since the three organisations had come together. On 9 December the archive confirmed that it would centralise its collections from Auckland and Christchurch to the former TVNZ Avalon facility in Lower Hutt, and that five jobs would be lost.\n\nThe restructure saw many staff disestablished. Staff had to apply for new roles, and in some cases relocate to Wellington. Released under an Official Information Act request, correspondence from a redacted individual to the Prime Minister John Key noted that the biggest loss would occur in Collection Services - which encompassed the acquisition and conservation areas. Out of a total of 35 current positions in that department, 33 (94% of the staff) would be disestablished or ended, with the guarantee of fewer positions available in the new structure.\n\nThe restructure was largely implemented by April 2017. Employee figures from 30 June 2017 showed that there had been a decrease from 80 to 61 full-time positions since 30 June 2016, but an increase of 13 part-time positions at the archive.\n\nOne of the main aspects of the restructure was the closure of the former RNZ Sound Archives audio preservation facilities in Christchurch and the relocation of 100,000 collection items to Wellington.\n\nStaff and unions raised concerns about the move, including whether the material could be safely transferred. Union members also said the relocation went against promises made by the Minister of Arts, Culture and Heritage Chris Finlayson to keep the archives in Christchurch following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in July 2016 also noted that the archive was \"committed to remaining in Christchurch as part of the Canterbury recovery.\"\n\nContrary to the sentiment expressed in the Strategic Plan, an Archives New Zealand email released under the Official Information Act, noted that Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision Chief Executive Rebecca Elvy had advised Archives New Zealand at the start of August 2016 that the political pressure to have the sound archives in Christchurch had been removed, and that the archive was not wedded to keeping the archive in that region. Ms Elvy was interested in Palmerston North as an alternative site.\n\nA fact sheet provided by Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision to Minister Maggie Barry noted that even though it wanted to close the Christchurch operation it would be \"increasing the level of activity and visibility that Cantabrians have to all of the collections\". This was likely to include Christchurch-based partnerships with galleries, cinemas, archives, museums and libraries.\n\nThe Office of Hon Maggie Barry worked closely with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision to formulate a set of consistent responses that could be used by the Minister and others. The text was circulated to other Ministers' Offices as suggested responses to media or stakeholder enquires.\n\nTwo weeks prior to the restructure being confirmed, opposition MP Jacinda Ardern submitted seven written questions to the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry regarding the proposed restructure. The most notable question which was later highlighted by RNZ news, was \"Does the Minister consider it satisfactory that much of New Zealand's audio-visual heritage is in the hands of a private trust which is not answerable in any formal or legal way to the people of New Zealand except through temporary funding contracts?\" Ms Ardern was told that Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision was accountable through its agreement with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. And later, in response to an Official Information Act request Minister Barry wrote that \"though significantly funded by government, Ngā Taonga is a non-government organisation and is responsible for its own organisational matters. It would therefore be inappropriate for me as a Minister to interfere with Ngā Taonga's internal decision-making.\"\n\nThe New Zealand First Party said that relocating the national sound archives from Christchurch to Wellington was a direct result of the government's obsession with centralisation. New Zealand First Leader Winston Peters said \"The wisdom of shifting archives to an area which is considered an earthquake risk in which 60 buildings were closed after the recent Kaikoura earthquake with some having to be demolished, must also be questioned. The plan was only announced to staff on November 7 and has been rushed through without professional risk management or sufficient input from the cultural heritages sector.\"\n\nThe Archives and Records Association of New Zealand wrote to Minister Maggie Barry and opposition MP Jacinda Ardern to express their concerns with the restructure. The Association noted that relocating all of the collections to Wellington \"increases the risk of damage to these collections due to a severe earthquake or other natural disaster [...] A distributed collections model with the archives held in three separate regions lowers the risk to the total collection.\" The Association also noted that \"due to continual staffing cuts, due to rolling restructures, most repositories and archives (government, private and charitable) are facing large backlogs of historic collections awaiting processing. It would be disappointing if the effect of the Ngā Taonga review would be to compound any such backlog.\"\n\nMayor of Christchurch Lianne Dalziel expressed concern to Minister Maggie Barry that the collections would be threatened by \"centralised location in Wellington, which could be cut off for months\" following a natural disaster. Ms Dalziel said she would be disappointed if Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision did not have a future alongside other institutions committed to supporting the city's regeneration following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Ms Dalziel also noted that Prime Minister Bill English had talked about the Government's ongoing commitment to Christchurch in his 2016 Budget Speech.\n\nThe Public Service Association said that decades of institutional knowledge would be lost. PSA National Secretary Erin Polaczuk said \"We understand there has been little consultation with the wider heritage sector, which is concerned about the fragility of the archive, and the expertise needed to administer it.\" She went on to say \"This is the third round of restructuring in the four years since the Film and Sound archives merged, and the impact on staff can’t be underestimated.\"\n\nFilm researcher Dr Emma Kelly campaigned against the move saying valuable heritage material and expertise would be lost. Dr Kelly began an online petition calling for the restructure to be stopped to allow \"iwi, users, viewers and other communities have a say.\" The petition was presented to the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry and Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision Jane Kominik.\n\nThe restructuring drew international concern from the Association of Moving Image Archivists who wrote to Minister Maggie Barry, opposition MP Jacinda Ardern, Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision Jane Kominik and Chief Executive Rebecca Elvy strongly \"urging caution and broad consultation before committing to any action.\" The Association believed that the restructure could have \"detrimental consequences for the staff and the collections they conserve\", and may pose major risks to the long term stability of the collections.\n\nIn December 2017 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision confirmed to RNZ news that unless it got an increase in government funding it would make cutbacks. The news report followed Ngā Taonga's briefing to Jacinda Ardern, the incoming Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage. The briefing noted that if funding was maintained at its current level the archive would need to reduce its accountabilities.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision's headquarters are based in the Wellington region, although it takes its \"national role seriously and work[s] hard to offer access throughout the country.\" In November 2017, Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision noted that since it was established in 2014 it had consolidated its property portfolio: from nine facilities in three regions, to five facilities in one region, with two small satellite offices in Auckland and Christchurch.\n\nPrior to the 2016/17 restructure at Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision, the TVNZ Archive collection was the only collection stored permanently at the former TVNZ Archive facility at 181A Taita Drive, Lower Hutt. Since the restructure, the majority of the archive's physical collection items have been moved there. The building contains 20km worth of climate-controlled storage. In 2014 twelve staff worked there.\n\nThe facility and land are owned by the Crown and managed by the Department of Internal Affairs. In 2014 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage appointed Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision as the initial Archive Manager, giving it the right to occupy the publicly-owned facility. The occupancy conditions are documented in the Licence to Occupy Archive Facility and in the Memorandum of Understanding - Access to TVNZ Archive Collection, between the Ministry for Culture and Heritage and the Department of Internal Affairs. \n\nAs Archive Manager, Ngā Taonga is allowed to use the fixtures and fittings in the facility in connection with managing the TVNZ Archive collection. This includes items such as the archive shelving and air-conditioning system. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision can only undertake minor alterations (such as painting a wall) at the Avalon facility. Larger alterations need the consent of the Department of Internal Affairs.\n\nThe Department of Internal Affairs is responsible for building maintenance, paying charges for building services, security service charges, exterior cleaning and grounds maintenance. The Ministry for Culture and Heritage and Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision are responsible for the maintenance of the TVNZ Archive equipment. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision is responsible for paying utility charges (water, gas, electricity etc.), rubbish collection, internal cleaning and provisioning of toilets and any other shared facilities. They do not pay any rent or occupancy fees.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision has a small satellite office located within the Hazeldean shared office business centre in Addington. Visits are by appointment only.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision has a small satellite office located within Radio New Zealand House at 171 Hobson Street. \nFrom April 2005 it housed a branch of RNZ Sound Archives. The office was redeveloped circa 2014, with the construction of two studios, a separate tape cleaning area, on-site storage and a small office area. The sound studios were used to preserve the Ngā Taonga Kōrero audio collection. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision moved the audio collection to Avalon as part of the 2016/17 restructure.\n\nIn December 2015, staff from the former New Zealand Film Archive public facility in Karangahape Road moved to Hobson Street. Originally intended as a new public facility, the Hobson Street site was due to be refurbished and opened in early 2016.The site was to include a library and viewing spaces. However the branch remained closed to the public.\n\nResponding to news reports during the 2016 restructure, Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision said that there were no permanent collections in Auckland and that the facility only had two permanent staff who were in back-office roles.\n\nThe New Zealand Film Archive purchased the 84 Taranaki Street property in 2002 for $2.5 million. It is a six-level building which houses a 107-seat cinema, the Jonathan Dennis research library, a media library, as well as offices and technical facilities. After the 2014 amalgamation, it became the head office of Ngā Taonga. 69 staff and 4 volunteers were based there in 2014, although the archive reported to the incoming Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage that the building only had 47 staff.\n\nIn its Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in mid-2016, Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision itself described the building as: cold and uninviting with nothing to see or do unless you are attending the cinema. The building was not insulated and required a new lift and roof, plus a heating/cooling/humidity control system. The Jonathan Dennis Library was rarely open and accessible. The cinema was uncomfortable and cold and not large enough. The media library was dark and contained predominantly video formats which were becoming obsolete.\n\nThe building is considered earthquake-prone by the Wellington City Council and was given a yellow notice. The yellow notice requires the building owner to either strengthen the building or demolish all or part of it. In November 2017 Ngā Taonga signaled to the Minister for Culture and Heritage that it would need to exit the earthquake-prone site and further consolidate its property footprint. In early 2018 a newly incorporated company became the owner of the property. Under the terms of sale Ngā Taonga is leasing back the building.\n\nThe majority of New Zealand's audiovisual heritage, managed by Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision, is stored in the Wellington region.\n\nSince 2017 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision has stored most of its physical collection in the Avalon facility in Lower Hutt. The facility is owned by the Crown and managed by the Department of Internal Affairs. It has four vaults: a cold vault, a documentation vault, a general vault and a temporary vault. The cold vault has a temperature of 7-8C which is higher than best practice conditions for the storage of film (2-4C), and the temporary vault which now holds the former Sound Archives acetate disc collection does not meet best practice conditions.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision lease the Map Room in a two-storey underground bunker built into Mount Cook. The site is referred to in corporate documents as Buckle Street. Constructed during World War II, the bunker and tunnels are located underground behind the former Dominion Museum building, with an operational entrance next to Wellington High School on Taranaki Street. The storage area contains film, large equipment and paper documentation. In 2012/13 the store was reorganised and filled to 85% of capacity. The vault reaches temperatures over 18C, well above best practice conditions for the storage of film (2-4C) and paper based documentation (13-18C).\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision purchased 21 Northpoint Street, Plimmerton for $253,590 in September 2009. In 2011 the archive built a purpose-built storage facility to hold data tapes, film and video masters. The facility is referred to in corporate documents as Northpoint. The temperature of the vault is currently around 15C, well above best practice conditions for the storage of film (2-4C).\n\nThere are two vaults at Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's head office at 84 Taranaki Street, Wellington - a cold vault and a documentation vault. The archive notes that the cold vault is poorly sealed and that the documentation vault lacks humidity control. The entire building is also considered earthquake-prone.\n\nA purpose-built, 100 square metre climate controlled nitrate film vault was built in Titahi Bay in partnership with Archives New Zealand in 2013 on land owned by Radio New Zealand. The vault is referred to in corporate documents as Whitireia. Archives New Zealand contributed $100,000 towards the project which cost in total $366,000. After construction, Ngā Taonga moved four tonnes of flammable nitrate film from Makomako in North Wairarapa to the new vault over a one-week period. The vault also holds nitrate collections from Archives New Zealand and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Even though it was purpose-built by the archive and publicised as having \"controlled preservation conditions\", Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision now believes the storage conditions in the vault are below standard and not within best practice. Currently the nitrate film is stored at 15C, where ideally it should be stored between 2-4C. In 2018 public concerns were raised over the vault's close proximity to a newly proposed radio transmission mast, potentially heightening the risk of inadvertent ignition of flammable atmospheres by radio frequency radiation - particularly when archive staff do regular “wind-throughs” of nitrate film reels.\n\nAfter the closure of the Cashel Street location in 2017, Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision established a small satellite office located within the Blackheath Place office complex at 73 Durham Street South. The building is listed with Heritage New Zealand as an Historic Place Category 2. Visits were by appointment only. In early 2018 the office was relocated to shared business accommodation in Addington.\n\n324 Cashel Street was the former location of the RNZ Sound Archive, and latterly the location of the majority of Ngā Taonga's sound archiving operations. It was the site of the archive's largest audio storage vault, in which over 90,000 items were housed in controlled archival conditions. These included early audio cylinders, acetate discs, open reel tapes, cassette tapes and digital audio tapes. The branch also held publicity materials and documentation relating to the sound collection.\n\nPreservation, cataloguing and client supply activities took place, and there were also public listening facilities (by appointment only). 10-12 staff were based there in 2014. As part of the 2016/17 restructure Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision closed the facility in the first half of 2017, moving the collection to Avalon and remaining staff to Blackheath Place, Christchurch.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision had a branch site located at 300 Karangahape Road which was primarily moving-image focused. The facility, which was a former New Zealand Film Archive branch, was open to the public weekdays 11am-5pm, with free admission. It had viewing and research facilities, along with a frequently changing exhibition space. The Auckland branch also held regular public screenings in association with partner institutions, including Auckland University of Technology and Colab.\n\nSix staff were based there in 2014. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision closed the facility in December 2015, moving staff to the Hobson Street site.\n\nIn April 2005 RNZ Sound Archives moved the Ngā Taonga Kōrero audio collection to a purpose-built archive facility at RNZ's transmission site in Henderson, Auckland. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision moved the collection to Avalon as part of the 2016/17 restructure.\n\nThe RNZ transmitter site at Titahi Bay held parts of the RNZ Sound Archives collection. This site was still being utilised by Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision after the amalgamation.\n\nFollowing the 2011 Christchurch earthquake RNZ Christchurch and RNZ Sound Archives shared the same building at 324 Cashel Street. The 2012 transfer agreement between RNZ and the then New Zealand Film Archive, pointed in principle to both parties again cohabiting a new RNZ Christchurch facility that was being developed. The agreement pointed out that there was no legal obligation on either party to follow through with the accommodation proposal.\n\nBy January 2014, the archive was in discussions with the Department of Internal Affairs and the University of Canterbury over a possible combined site at Ilam. This would house the former RNZ Sound Archives, be the South Island headquarters for Archives NZ and the location for the University Library archives.\n\nIn November 2014, Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision reported that the Department of Internal Affairs could find it difficult to meet the archive's preferred timetable to accommodate the long term needs of its sound archiving operations by 2016. The archive said it would continue discussions with the Department but it would also re-enter conversations with RNZ over its accommodation in Christchurch.\n\nOn 23 January 2015 an agreement was signed between Archives New Zealand and Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision in relation to co-locating the two archives in a proposed new specialised facility at Wigram, Christchurch. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision said that it would bring the archive alongside other Christchurch heritage agencies and would \"provide an enhanced public access service to the region.\"\n\nArchives NZ is a part of the Department of Internal Affairs. The Department led the co-location project, with the primary aim to build a new facility for Archives NZ in Christchurch after the 2011 earthquake damaged their Peterborough Street building and surrounding land. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision would tenant 300 square metres of storage space, and have sound-proof preservation studios, office spaces and a front-of-house area.\n\nBudget 2015 confirmed $6.1 million in operating funding (over 4 years) and $13 million of capital funding from the Future Investment Fund to build the new facility. Construction was scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2016. Internal Affairs Minister Peter Dunne said \"The Archives project is good news for the people of Christchurch and a clear signal of the Government’s intent to keep the Christchurch rebuild on-track\".\n\nThe location of the new facility at Wigram followed Archives NZ negotiations with the New Zealand Defence Force. The two parties saw mutual benefit in having Archives NZ situated in close proximity to the Air Force Museum, as Archives NZ is the main primary research source for people researching New Zealand's military history.\n\nNegotiations between Archives NZ and Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision were sometimes tense, with an Archives NZ contractor noting in an email that they would have to explain to Ngā Taonga \"in words of one syllable\". Another internal Archives NZ email noted \"the irony is [that] they are getting a really good deal with a purpose built design and fit out essentially free of charge and security of tenancy (and rent) in a volatile rental market.\"\n\nBy October 2015 the co-location was in jeopardy because of changing project timeframes. The Board of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision requested an urgent investigation to find the cost differential between \"access storage\" and \"preservation storage\" options at the new facility. An internal Archives NZ email noted that Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision had \"a number of difficult property decisions to make.\"\n\nBy early 2016 both parties were again committed, discussing specific building and furniture requirements. In July 2016 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision had an operational restructure and then published its Strategic Plan 2016-2024. As part of its strategic direction, the archive said it was \"committed to remaining in Christchurch as part of the Canterbury recovery\". However a couple of weeks later, an Archives New Zealand email noted that Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision Chief Executive Rebecca Elvy had advised them that the political pressure to have the sound archives in Christchurch had been removed, and that the archive was not wedded to keeping the archive in that region.\n\nBy mid-September a Department of Internal Affairs email noted that Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision were \"pleading poverty\" over the costs involved, and by 30 September 2016 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision had withdrawn completely from the co-location project, pointing to their inability to pay the rental charges.\n\nThe late stage withdrawal saw the Department of Internal Affairs seeking other tenants. An internal email noted that this would be much more preferable than having to scale down the building. Another internal email noted that \"there was a lot of effort put into the design to accommodate [Ngā Taonga] which does have a cost implication\".\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision's Christchurch staff were told about the withdrawal in mid-October, and by early November a major staff restructuring was underway. This would ultimately see the Christchurch preservation facility closed and all of the sound collections moved from Christchurch to Wellington in 2017.\n\nArchives New Zealand continued the development of the Wigram facility at 15 Harvard Avenue which is due to be operational by mid-2018.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision receives core funding from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage from Vote Arts, Culture and Heritage. Over half of the $5 million annually received from the Ministry is for the management of the TVNZ Archive and RNZ Sound Archive collections.\n\nIn the 2011/12 financial year, NZ On Air funded RNZ Sound Archives $677,000. When the archive was transferred to Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision on 1 October 2012 an extra $300,000 per annum was allocated by the Government, bringing the Government's total annual investment in the sound collection close to $1 million. After the transfer, funding was delivered via the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. The archive told the Ministry that it proposed to spend $1.5 million annually on audio archiving.\n\nThe annual income received from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage was initially ring-fenced for sound archiving. The New Zealand Film Archive received $790,368 for 2012/13 (part year), and $1 million in 2013/14. However, by 2014/15 the ring-fencing had disappeared and the $1 million for sound archiving had been channelled into a general fund. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's general funding from the Ministry increased in that year from $2,020,000 to $3,019,700.\n\nIn 2011/12 before its transfer to Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision, RNZ Sound Archives had expenditure of $884,000. By 2014/15, Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's Radio Division (i.e. the former RNZ Sound Archive) had expenditure of $823,335. However, by November 2016, and shortly before Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision closed the former RNZ Sound Archive preservation facility in Christchurch, the archive said it was only spending approximately $430,000 per annum to run the Christchurch operation. This included rent, salaries and office overheads.\n\nIn 2012 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage estimated the annual net cost to TVNZ of running the TVNZ Archive was between $0.5 and $1 million. For the 2014/15 year Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision received $1,590,000 from the Ministry for the ongoing \"management, archiving and increased accessibility\" of the TVNZ Archive collection. Thereafter it received $2 million per year for the same purpose. Two documents were used to inform the initial Budget Bid for operating expenses by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage: a financial due diligence report from PriceWaterhouseCoopers and a proposal from the New Zealand Film Archive. \n\nIn May 2017 Chair of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision Jane Kominik wrote to the Minister for Arts Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry noting that the archive was about to begin discussions with the Ministry for Culture and Heritage over two areas \"for which Nga Taonga has never been funded\": access to audiovisual collections beyond current levels and the digitisation of TVNZ Betacam and DigiBeta tape formats beyond business as usual levels.\n\nIn November 2017 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision noted to the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage that activity-based costings were not conducted at the time of the TVNZ Archive transfer in 2014.\n\nTe Māngai Pāho provides funding to Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision for the archiving of television programmes broadcast by the Māori Television Service and the archiving of iwi radio programmes. In 2012/13 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision entered into negotiations with Te Māngai Pāho to provide archiving services for the 21 iwi radio stations throughout the country.\n\nNZ Lottery Grants Board provides a fixed percentage of Lottery profits annually. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision is one of four agencies that receive this type of annual funding.\n\nIn March 2015 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision created an online Givealittle donation page seeking financial contributions from the public. Givealittle is an online fundraising platform run by the Spark Foundation.\n\nOn 19 October 2017, the Governor-General of New Zealand Dame Patsy Reddy launched Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's patronage programme at Government House, Wellington. The archive established the patronage programme because of uncertainty over funding. The public donation programme initially highlighted the need to preserve and digitise 200,000 Betacam video tapes from the 1980s which were predominantly from the TVNZ Archive collection.\n\nChief Executive of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision Rebecca Elvy told RNZ news that it would cost $10-15 million to digitise the Betacam tapes, which otherwise would be lost forever when the technology vanished by 2025.\n\nAs well as acquiring new collection items, Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision manages three historic collections: the New Zealand Film Archive collection, the RNZ Sound Archives and the TVNZ Archive collection. Collectively, the RNZ Sound Archives and TVNZ Archive collections form the majority (65% at August 2014) of the total collection. They are considered public records under the Public Records Act 2005. \n\nThe table below shows the variation in the reported size of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's collections. The figures are drawn from official correspondence, documents and websites. \n\nNotably the reported size of the TVNZ Archive collection dropped by 212,000 items between 2013 and 2017. As custodian of the TVNZ Archive Collection since 2014, the Ministry for Culture and Heritage has never audited the size of the collection. It believes the significant drop in the reported size is because Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision is currently only estimating the size of the collection. The Ministry is waiting on the archive to complete an audit (due by August 2018). The archive will then share the methodology and total number of items with the Ministry.\n\nBy 2012 the New Zealand Film Archive collection contained over 150,000 items including moving-images from 1895 to the present day.\n\nThe collection includes predominantly New Zealand features and short films, newsreels, documentaries, home movies, music videos, television programmes, commercials, experimental films and video art. The collection also contains items with significant Māori content, including records of karanga, whaikorero, iwi and hapu whakapapa, powhiri, wharenui and marae, kapa haka, Waitangi Day events (from 1934), raranga, tukutuku and whakairo.\n\nThere are also stills, posters, scripts, clippings, printed programmes, publicity material, production records and files, personal records, storyboards, props and costumes, animation cells, taped interviews, glass advertising slides, ephemera and equipment.\n\nDating to before the amalgamation of the TVNZ Archive collection, the New Zealand Film Archive maintained the National Television Collection on behalf of NZ on Air. This involved constantly recording off-air broadcasts including television news, dramas, documentaries, games shows, music videos, infomercials, youth programming and sport. Māori broadcasting was archived on behalf of Te Mangai Paho, the Māori Broadcasting Funding Agency.\n\nThe New Zealand Film Archive collection also holds the Chapman Collection. Deposited by Professor Robert and Noeline Chapman of the Political Studies Department at Auckland University, the collection begins with audio recordings of television news from the 1960s. From 1984 the collection contains VHS recordings of nightly news bulletins. The Chapman collection precedes TVNZ's own archival collection of television news.\n\nIn July 2012 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage authored a memorandum that in part outlined how the New Zealand Film Archive would be able to \"protect and enhance\" RNZ Sound Archive's work while growing the Film Archive's own business. The Ministry pointed to how the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia handled both sound and film without sound being a \"poor relation\" - a reason often cited for not merging the two activities.\n\nAs part of the document the Film Archive set out its vision for a combined archive. The Film Archive wanted to \"bring the audio facilities up to the quality established over the last decade for the film and video operation.\" Within the new archive there would be a staff of over 60 specialists, and there would be an increase in money spent annually on audio archiving, from the current $884,000 to $1.5 million.\n\nThe new archive would put an emphasise on preservation and public accessibility: \"Users will be able to access key sounds and images from the last 100 years and combine them in new television and radio programmes, exhibitions, websites, teaching materials and community projects.\" Greater access to the audio collections would come from adding an audio dimension to the Film Archive's medianet sites, research libraries in Wellington and Auckland and other community and educational initiatives.\n\nThe RNZ Sound Archive staff and collection were transferred to Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision on 1 October 2012. The contents of the collection are subject to the Public Records Act 2005. In 2014 the collection was valued at $800,000. On 30 June 2016 RNZ transferred to Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision the full legal ownership and title of physical assets used by RNZ Sound Archives at the time of the archive's transfer in 2012. The net book value of radio assets held by Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision was $423,946 on 1 July 2014, dropping to $172,029 on 30 June 2017.\n\nThe RNZ Sound Archive collection is made of two distinct parts: the general Radio New Zealand historical collection and Ngā Taonga Kōrero - a collection of Māori and Pacific recordings. All together there are over 110,000 items - both physical items and digital files. The collection includes early audio cylinders, acetate discs, open reel tapes, cassette tapes and digital audio tapes. The collection also contains publicity materials and documentation relating to the sound collection.\n\nThe RNZ general historical collection dates back to the late 1930s when the State broadcaster established a \"special library\". 100,000 physical items from the collection were relocated from Christchurch to Wellington as part of the 2016/17 restructure.\n\nThe Ngā Taonga Kōrero collection dates from the early 1960s when the Māori section of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation was established. Leo Fowler and Wiremu Kerekere travelled throughout the country recording hui, marae openings, cultural festivals, welcomes and farewells. Both raw and edited audio was kept.\n\nFor many years the collection was held in Papatoetoe, before moving in 1985 with the associated programme unit, then known as Te Reo o Aotearoa, to RNZ's Cook Street facility. In the 2000s the audio preservation staff moved with RNZ to a new Hobson Street site and the collection was moved to a purpose-built archive facility at RNZ's transmission site in Henderson. Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision moved the collection to Avalon as part of the 2016/17 restructure.\n\nAs part of the transfer of RNZ Sound Archives to the New Zealand Film Archive (now Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision), the archive received one-off project funding of $1 million from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage for the digitisation of the sound collection over two years.\n\nThe project was titled the Sound Archive Digitisation Project and formed part of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage (2012/13). The archive had to submit a plan to the Ministry for how it would use the funding by 15 December 2012. They also had to report separately on the plan's progress at regular intervals.\n\nMinister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Chris Finlayson said \"This is an important project that not only ensures the secure storage and preservation of these important records, but through digitisation will help make the living history contained in the archives more readily accessible.\" However in private the money was also seen by some as a contingency fund. The archive had been concerned about taking on the cost of redundancy provisions that the former RNZ Sound Archives staff had under their RNZ employment agreements. Employment contracts at the New Zealand Film Archive did not have redundancy provisions.\n\nIn January 2013 the Chief Executive of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage Lewis Holden wrote to the Chair of the New Zealand Film Archive Jane Kominik noting that $141,670 of the digitisation fund could, if required, be retained for a few years and used to cover RNZ Sound Archive staff redundancy payments. Mr Holden stated \"provided that the [archive] delivers the services that have been agreed with the Minister, it is free to decide when to spend allocated monies\". Mr Holden went on to state \"With respect to one-off transition costs [...] we remain prepared to consider any request for additional relief as a charge against funds from the one-off project.\"\n\nThe New Zealand Film Archive/Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision received from the Ministry for Culture and Heritage $150,000 in 2013, $610,000 in 2014 and $224,000 in 2015 for the radio digitisation project. The archive's Annual Report (2013/14) noted project expenditure of $0 in 2013 and $144,235 in 2014.\n\nThe digitisation project was due to begin in July 2013 with the aim of digitising an estimated 20,000 audio items by mid-2015. However technical and methodological issues delayed the project until the start of 2014.\nThe archive was meant to submit regular monthly reports along with six-monthly updates in 2014 and 2015, plus additional reports in July 2014 and 2015 detailing progress on the project to the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. However in response to an Official Information Act request in August 2018, the ministry confirmed that it did not hold any reports from the archive relating to the sound digitisation project. It also could not provide an itemized list of expenditure for the project and said it held no further information (other than Lewis Holden's letter) relating to the possible use of project funding for other purposes.\n\nThe TVNZ Archive collection holds over 600,000 hours of television spanning almost 55 years of New Zealand's public television history. In 2014 the Ministry for Culture and Heritage appointed Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision as the initial Archive Manager to manage the collection on a day-to-day basis. Since then, the archive has failed to comply with preservation and access targets set out in the Memorandum of Understanding (2014-2018) with the Crown. This has attracted national media and public criticism.\n\nRadio broadcasts of collection material have produced the biggest audiences for Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision, with 924,000 listens in a year to a regular archival audio segment during Jessie Mulligan's afternoon radio programme on RNZ National.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision estimates that it would take up to eight weeks to supply a requester with a viewing copy of moving-image material or an item from the documentation collection. This was due to collection material not being production-ready. The 2-month delivery period covered research, retrieval, preparation of material, transfer time, clearances and delivery. Sound items have a faster supply time, with standard orders of up to three items usually available within fifteen days.\n\nIn its Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in mid-2016, Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision noted that the archive had a predominantly white, middle-class, Wellington clientele. The archive had targeted 'art-lovers' and film aficionados \"at the expense of every other group\".\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision run a regular screening programme in the 107-seat cinema of content from the archive's collection. The cinema is also used for educational screenings and can be hired by community organisations and groups. In 2016 the archive itself described the cinema as uncomfortable, cold and not large enough.\n\nA gallery space operated in the Taranaki Street building and featured regularly changing exhibitions.\n\nA news report at the time of Rebecca Elvy's appointment as Chief Executive in 2015, noted that Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision had an extensive range of film-related memorabilia including scripts, advertisements, posters and props, costumes and animation cells which the archive was working to make available via public display. \"We want to find a way to share that with the public. There's lots of things that people aren't aware of that they can come take a look at\" Ms Elvy said. However the gallery closed in 2015, with the final exhibition highlighting the Pacific Films production company. The exhibition's title was Don't Let It Get You, a reference to the film of the same name.\n\nSelected titles in the collection can be viewed in the Media Library at the Taranaki Street site. In 2016 the archive noted that the library contained predominantly video formats which were becoming obsolete.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision operates medianet, a digital video resource that provides access to a small curated selection of ﬁlm and TV items at sites across New Zealand. In 2012 medianet had 915 moving image titles available. The number of medianet sites dropped from seventeen in 2016 to thirteen in 2018.\n\nKiosks allow the viewer to browse by category, decade, title or through descriptive tags, and view full-length videos at full screen quality. Playlists provide curated sets of videos of particular interest to local communities. As of 2018, medianet operated in Lower Hutt, Hawke's Bay, Otago, Manawatu, Nelson, Northland, Rotorua, Southland, Taranaki, Tauranga, Waikato and Wellington.\n\nMediasphere is promoted as Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's education service. The film-centric website was launched in 2013 and is promoted by the archive as a site where teachers, parents and students can \"watch extracts from films, and start thinking about, writing about and making their own films\". The site features resources for English, Social Sciences, History, Geography and Media Studies students and teachers.\n\nThe Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry launched Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision's new website in January 2016. For the first time, the website brought together the collections of the former RNZ Sound Archive and the New Zealand Film Archive. The online catalogue was powered by Supplejack - DigitalNZ's tool for aggregating content.\n\nIn 2014 Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision noted that the Ministers of Broadcasting and Arts, Culture and Heritage had an expectation that a substantial proportion of the archive's collections be digitised and made available online by 2018. The archive’s Statement of Intent 2015-2018 aimed for 20,000 items online. However the Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in mid-2016 noted that there was still only a small amount of the collection available online.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision's Strategic Plan 2016-2024 published in mid-2016, noted significant issues with the archive's acquisition and deposit activities. The Strategic Plan noted the Selection and Acquisition Policy was out of date, there were three different deposit agreements and there was a significant backlog of material that hadn't been accessioned/catalogued. There were also a large number of depositors who had been promised a copy of their items but had not received them - with some waiting over ten-years.\n\nIn 2012 the New Zealand Film Archive noted in a document to the Ministry for Culture and Heritage that the archive not only wanted to combine the existing national collections of film, television and radio but potentially enlarge the archive's mandate by collecting recorded music, oral histories, computer gaming and new audiovisual media.\n\nIn February 2017 a revised Selection and Acquisition Policy was published, broadening the scope of what the archive collected. This included film, television, radio, sound, digital, moving image and sound works created by New Zealand artists, musical works, oral histories, software, live broadcasts, recordings of meetings and recordings of nature such as bird-life. The archive would also continue to collect equipment, documentation and supporting material - photographs, posters, costumes, books, publicity material etc.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision accepts material on deposit. The depositor can withdraw material at any time, with the rights pertaining to the material unchanged by the act of depositing with the archive.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision has three layers of rights clearance: the depositor, the work's copyright holder and the cultural values of iwi and Māori. The archive undertakes to honour the wishes of all rights holders.\n\nNgā Taonga Sound & Vision measures itself against the internationally agreed standards of the Image Permanence Institute (IPI) and the International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA). \n\nIn its Selection and Acquisition Policy, the archive undertakes to store collection items in optimum conditions to ensure their long-term survival, document items so that they can be easily found and make them accessible in a way that does not compromise their long-term preservation. In 2012 the archive noted how it had attracted international interest for \"its innovative approach to low-cost, high-quality collection storage using technology adapted from the horticulture sector.\"\n\nNgā Taonga's 2016/17 Annual Report noted that only 56% of the collection was held in best practice storage conditions, and a 2017 report from the archive to the Ministry for Culture and Heritage noted that the entire film collection was stored in conditions that it considered was below standard. The former Sound Archive's acetate disc collection was also stored in below standard conditions.\n\n"}
{"id": "4167411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4167411", "title": "Night at the Museum", "text": "Night at the Museum\n\nNight at the Museum is a 2006 American fantasy-comedy film directed by Shawn Levy and written by Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon, based on the 1993 children's book of the same name by Croatian illustrator Milan Trenc. The film stars Ben Stiller as Larry Daley, a divorced father who applies for a job as a night watchman at New York City's American Museum of Natural History and subsequently discovers that the exhibits, animated by a magical Egyptian artifact, come to life at night.\n\nIt was released on December 22, 2006 by 20th Century Fox. The first installment in the \"Night at the Museum\" trilogy, the film was a box office success despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, grossing over $574 million.\nLarry Daley is a divorced man from Brooklyn, hoping to find a good job to impress his ten-year-old son Nick, but his ex-wife Erica believes he is a bad example for their son. Larry is hired at the American Museum of Natural History to replace the retiring security guards Cecil Fredericks, Gus, and Reginald. Larry meets the museum's neurotic curator Dr. McPhee, and very attractive museum docent Rebecca Hutman, who plans to write a dissertation on Sacagawea. On his first night, Cecil hands Larry an instruction manual on what to do in the museum, warning him not to let anything \"in or out.\"\n\nLarry soon discovers that at night, the museum's exhibits come to life and cause havoc for him. Amongst the lively exhibits are a playful \"Tyrannosaurus\" skeleton named Rexy; a mischievous capuchin monkey named Dexter who destroys the instructions; the warring miniature factions of cowboys and legionnaires led by Jedediah and General Octavius; violent Attila the Hun and his army; a talking Easter Island Head that desires gum who calls Larry \"dum dum\"; the fire-seeking neanderthals; and a wax model of Theodore Roosevelt, who is in love with Sacagawea.\n\nRoosevelt explains to Larry that the exhibits have come to life every night since the arrival of an Egyptian artifact, the Tablet of Akhmenrah, the mummified pharaoh trapped in his sarcophagus. He also explains to Larry that as night guard, it is his job to make sure that no exhibit sets foot out of the museum, otherwise they will disintegrate into dust if the sun rises while they are outside. The next day, Cecil advises Larry to research history to make up for the instructions' destruction. He studies in libraries and from Rebecca. Larry puts his new knowledge to good use on his second night, but some of his plans backfire and the neanderthals set their exhibit on fire, leading to one becoming dust after venturing outside. After having doubts and almost getting fired the next day, Larry offers to introduce Sacagawea to Rebecca, but she thinks he is mocking her.\n\nOn his third night, Larry brings Nick to the museum to watch the exhibits come to life, but they strangely do not. They catch Cecil, Gus, and Reginald stealing artifacts, who explain the tablet's magic has allowed them to feel physically young in their old age, and plot to frame Larry for the theft while they enjoy a happy retirement. Nick activates the tablet, but Cecil steals it, locking Larry and Nick in the Egyptian exhibit. They free Akhmenrah, and rally the exhibits to stop the thieves and retrieve their colleagues who fled out into Central Park. Gus and Reginald are captured, but Cecil escapes by stagecoach.\n\nLarry and several exhibits give chase, where they stop Cecil and recover the tablet, using its magic to escort all of the exhibits back into the museum before sunrise. Rebecca witnesses this and makes amends with Larry and is subsequently introduced to Sacagawea. The next day, McPhee fires Larry after watching news reports of sightings of the exhibits last night, but once they start to leave the museum, they find out that the reports have caused an increased number of visitors, and Larry is immediately rehired. Near the end of the film, Larry, Nick, and the exhibits throw a party in the museum. During the credits, it is shown that Cecil, Gus, and Reginald have been forced to serve as museum janitors for their crimes.\n\n\n\nThe building featured in the film, which was constructed on a sound stage in Burnaby, British Columbia, is based on the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, external shots of which were used in the movie.\n\nTrainers spent several weeks training Crystal, who plays the troublemaking monkey Dexter, to slap and bite Stiller in the film.\n\nRobin Williams' Theodore Roosevelt costume closely resembles that of John Wayne's character in \"The Shootist\".\n\nDirector Shawn Levy credited Ben Stiller for the ensemble cast: \"When actors hear that Ben Stiller is in a movie they want to work with him. It['s] a high-water mark and it absolutely draws actors in and I'm convinced that's a big part of why we got this cast.\"\n\n\nAlan Silvestri replaced John Ottman as score composer. Silvestri's score was used for the teaser trailer of \"Horton Hears a Who!\"\nVarèse Sarabande released a soundtrack album of the score on December 19, 2006.\n\"Night at the Museum\" had its premiere in New York City on December 17 2006, on December 22, 2006 in the United States, December 26, 2006 in UK, January 12, 2007 in Brazil, on February 14, 2007 in China and on March 17, 2007 in Japan.\n\nThe film was released under the title of \"Noche en el museo\" in Spain, \"Una note al museo\" in Italy, \"La nuit au musée\" in France, \"Ночь в музее\" in Russia and \"Uma Noite no Museu\" in Brazil.\n\nAt the end of its box office run, \"Night at the Museum\" earned a gross of $250.9 million in the US and Canada and $323.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $574.5 million against a budget of $110 million. It is the fifth highest-grossing film of 2006 and also the highest-grossing film worldwide of the trilogy.\n\nIt was the highest-grossing film in its opening weekend, grossing $30.8 million plating in 3,686 theaters, with a $8,258 per-theater average. For the four-day Christmas holiday weekend, it took in $42.2 million. The movie was also released in IMAX large screen format, often on site at museums of science or natural history such as the Pacific Science Center in Seattle.\n\nIn its second weekend, \"Night at the Museum\" expanded into 83 more theaters and took in approximately $36.7 million, out-grossing its opening weekend. It maintained the top position in its third week, with an additional $23.7 million.\n\nDuring its opening weekend of December 15, 2006, the film grossed a figure of estimated $5 million, with the highest debut coming from South Korea ($5.04 million). The biggest market in the other territories were the UK, Japan, South Korea, and Germany, where it grossed $40.8 million, $30 million, $25.7 million, $22.9 million.\n\n\"Night at the Museum\" received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 43%, based on 132 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Parents might call this either a spectacle-filled adventure or a shallow and vapid CG-fest, depending on whether they choose to embrace this on the same level as their kids\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 48 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nJames Berardinelli of Reelviews gave it 2 stars out of 4, and commented on Stiller's performance by stating \"It might be fair to give Ben Stiller an 'A' for effort, but to call what he does in this movie \"acting\" is a misnomer. He does a lot of running around, occasionally falling down or bumping into things.\" One positive review by William Arnold of the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", gave it a B-, and stated that the film was \"Out to impress and delight a family audience with the pageantry of human and natural history, and that's a surprisingly worthy ambition for a Hollywood comedy.\" In a case of life imitating art, museum officials at the American Museum of Natural History have credited the film for increasing the number of visitors during the holiday season by almost 20%. According to a museum official, between December 22, 2006, and January 2, 2007, there were 50,000 more visitors than during the same period the prior year. CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend, cinema audiences gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nThe film was released on a 2-Disc DVD edition in the United Kingdom on April 2, 2007. It was released on 1-Disc and 2-Disc DVD editions and Blu-ray Disc format on April 24, 2007 elsewhere.\n\nThe film became the first non-Disney film to be reviewed by Ultimate Disney (now known as DVDizzy.com), due to the website dealing with other studios besides Disney.\n\n, the film has sold 9,191,694 DVDs and grossed $153,566,058 in DVD sales.\n\nThe first installment in the trilogy, \"Night at the Museum\" was followed by a sequel titled \"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,\" which was released on May 22, 2009 in North America. The third and final installment, \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\", was released on December 19, 2014 in North America.\n\nIn 2016, The Hollywood Reporter stated that the Alibaba Pictures Group intended to remake the film.\n\n"}
{"id": "26786839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26786839", "title": "Paul Rebillot", "text": "Paul Rebillot\n\nPaul Rebillot (May 19, 1931 – February 11, 2010) was a member of the human potential movement. He is the author of \"The Call to Adventure: Bringing the Hero’s Journey to Daily Life\".\n\nPaul Rebillot was born on May 19, 1931 in Detroit, Michigan. His initial academic training was in philosophy and education at the University of Detroit and was followed by a Masters in Communication Arts, specialising in drama, from the University of Michigan. Before and after his university years he worked with several theatre companies as a writer, producer and actor.\nRebillot's military service took him, for a year, to Japan where he produced and directed radio programs for the U.S. Army's Far East Radio Network. His exposure to the Japanese culture and particularly to Noh, the stylised and ritualised form of Japanese drama, was subsequently to become an important influence on his use of ritual and gesture in his work.\n\nReturning to the United States, Rebillot developed an experimental theater department at San Francisco State College and, in the same period, worked with Mumako, a Japanese mime, developing his understanding of ritual gesture, meditation postures which shape the energies to the attitude expressed by the gesture, which became a key element in his work. In 1968, after a year of teaching at Stanford University’s theater department, he founded in San Francisco The Gestalt Fool Theater Family, a commune and a radical performance group, and commenced experimental work combining theatre, ritual and therapy.\n\nThe theater work, as well as a severe existential crisis, led him in 1971 to the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California. There, he worked with Stan Grof and John Lilly, trained in Gestalt Practice with Esalen's co-founder Dick Price and studied group process with Will Schutz. Rebillot met Joseph Campbell, an expert in comparative mythology who believed monomyths, motifs of adventure and transformation to be found in all heroic tales, could be found in all cultures. These encounters with Price, Schutz and Campbell laid the foundations of Rebillot's subsequent work in the human potential movement.\n\nIn 1972, Rebillot worked on the psychiatric wards of community hospitals in Turlock and Martinez, California. He shared his own experience of mental suffering and how he emerged from it. In 1973, drawing on Campbell's work and integrating Gestalt practice, movement, meditation, ritual, group process, drama, art, and music, he structured The Hero's Journey. Rebillot's name is most widely associated with this self-discovery process.\n\nIn 1974, while continuing to offer workshops and Gestalt trainings at Esalen Institute, Rebillot brought The Hero's Journey to Europe. There, he worked at various centers, including the Centre de développement du potentiel humain and the Boyesen Institute, France, Jay Stattman’s Institute of Unitive Psychology in The Netherlands and the Irish Foundation for Human Development. As his yearly tours throughout Europe developed, he attracted an eclectic mix of participants including many from the teaching and caring professions. Europe gradually became the location for most of his work and remained so for over thirty years.\n\nIn 1987 Rebillot was awarded a Laurance Rockefeller grant to work on a book about The Hero’s Journey. In 1993, \"The Call to Adventure: Bringing the Hero’s Journey to Daily Life\", was published, with a foreword by Stanislav Grof.\n\nRebillot had already published \"The Hero’s Journey: Ritualizing the Mystery\" in \"Spiritual Emergency: When Personal Transformation Becomes a Crisis\" (1989), a collective work edited by Stanislav and Christina Grof, to which he had contributed with Ronald Laing, Roberto Assagioli, John Weir Perry, Ram Dass, Lee Sannella, Jack Kornfield, Holger Kalweit, Anne Armstrong and Keith Thompson.\n\nRebillot initiated his last project in 2006 when he asked a cross-cultural group of nine students to join him and develop a journey based on the life of Abraham. The resulting workshop \"In the Footsteps of Abraham\" was delivered by that group in Rebillot's presence in Germany in 2007 and, after his retirement, in Ireland in 2009.\n\nIn March 2008, Rebillot retired from work in Europe, but continued to do training and consultancy work from his home in San Francisco. Upon his return he worked extensively with the Radical Change Group founders (Mahipal Lunia, Sergey Berezin & Arman Darini)to record and present his work to the world. In June 2009, just after his students facilitated \"In the footsteps of Abraham\" in Ireland, he fell ill. After struggling for eight months to overcome the effects of respiratory failure, he died at his home in San Francisco on February 11, 2010.\n\nPaul Rebillot was particularly struck by the suffering and confusion resulting from contemporary society's lack of significant rites of passage. He felt that, without shamans or ritual masters to guide them, modern women and men have to find their own lonely and sometimes traumatic paths from one stage of life to another. Hence, a fundamental theme of his work is personal transformation through ritual enactment.\n\nHis understanding of the power of myth and ritual helped him design self-discovery processes that he felt would enrich, heal and awaken individuals to their inner quest and the transpersonal dimensions of their lives. His experience of Gestalt practice led him to believe that each character in a myth represents a facet of oneself. Hence, experiencing a myth from inside, and from all points of view, he viewed as a way to reconnect with oneself and to reach renewed awareness. His background in theatre had convinced him of the capacity of bodily gesture and movement to reveal and to transform the point of view of the mind and the attitude of the heart. He believed that uniting the dimensions of body, heart and mind in order to ensure that one is true to oneself would lead to liberation. To this approach he added work with group processes, whereby group members support one another in their individual inner journeys, which he considered to be one of the most healing aspects of his work.\n\nIn 1988 Paul Rebillot inaugurated the School of Gestalt and Experiential Teaching, in Switzerland, a four-level professional training program combining Gestalt theory and practice with ritual, myth, and group process. Taking place over four years, this training offered practising therapists an opportunity to explore the nature of transformational processes such as the ones he had created, and to learn how to conceive and facilitate their own, according to the standards he had set. A North American training programme began in August 1993. In May 1996, he started a \"Rites of Passage\" training programme in Germany. From that time on, he offered advanced training programmes in Germany as well as in France, Ireland, England and Austria.\n\nParallel to this, students who wished to facilitate one of his structures, such as \"The Hero's Journey\", had to get his approval after completing a specific apprenticeship programme inspired by the practice of many theater companies and of the medieval guilds, in which students travel, live and work with their teachers as part of their training.\n\nAfter The Hero's Journey, created in 1973, Paul Rebillot developed numerous structures of inner journeys, including:\n\n\nBefore he retired to San Francisco, Paul Rebillot appointed some of his students to carry on with his work. In Ireland, the Rebillot School of Gestalt and Experiential Teaching and, in France, the Ecole de Gestalt et processus expérientiels and in Germany the Institut fuer Gestalt und Erfahrung were formed. The mission of all schools is to promote, deliver and safeguard Rebillot's work. They offer the opportunity to experience the inner journeys designed by Rebillot himself or by his students, according to his principles and standards, as part of their training and certification, or subsequent to their certification. The Ecole de Gestalt et processus expérientiels delivers advanced training in French, the Institut fuer Gestalt und Erfahrung in German.\n\n\n\nPaul Rebillot in his last years recorded most of his structures as a gift to the world in collaboration with his three students, Mahipal Lunia, Sergey Berezin and Arman Darini of the Radical Change Group. \n"}
{"id": "42613818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42613818", "title": "Piraeus Artemis", "text": "Piraeus Artemis\n\nPiraeus Artemis refers to two bronze statues of Artemis excavated in Piraeus in 1959, along with a large theatrical mask (possibly in honor of Dionysus) and three pieces of marble sculptures. Two other statues were found in the buried cache as well: a larger-than-lifesize bronze Late Archaic Apollo (Piraeus Apollo) and a similarly sized bronze fourth century-style Athena. Both statues are now exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Piraeus.\n\nPiraeus possessed a primary seaport, Cantharus, and, due to the foreign influence of trade and the mercenary garrison on Munychia hill, the city was also entry point for new cults in Attica. It has been theorized that this cache was a shipment that may have been overtaken when the Roman general, Sulla, sacked Piraeus in 86 B.C.E. However, since the various statues date from a time span of approximately five centuries, it could not have been shipped on private commission. It is possible that these bronze cult statues all come from one sanctuary that had been dedicated over the centuries before the collection was removed in the first century B.C.E. The cache could have been transported to Piraeus from almost anywhere, though as there are two representations of Artemis and one of Apollo, it's thought that the cache may be from Delos, the divine twins' birthplace.\n\nBoth Artemis statues are thought to be Hellenistic due to the hairstyle and stance, and both show a full-bodied Artemis with a long skirt that covers her legs. While the Artemis A figure is similar to the others in the collection and larger than life, the Artemis B statue is somewhat smaller than life-size.\n\nArtemis, a virgin goddess who kept away from men and civilization, signifying the wild aspect that was always apparent in Ancient Greek culture, came to be worshipped as a huntress and a sanctifier of solitude.\n\nShe was associated with young women and girls and biological maturation, and both Piraeus Artemis statues show the goddess as a curvaceous woman, not a wild young girl. The anger of the goddess was also feared and recounted in legends, and part of the worship consisted of appeasing the goddess. The statues convey this aspect; though in both depictions Artemis's stance is approachable, she carries her weapon, showing her ability to quickly withdraw favor. Often worshipped close to territorial frontiers and a little aways from settlements, female worshippers of Artemis were frequently in danger; a necessary aspect that came with worshipping the goddess.\nSeveral theories attempt to explain the placement of Artemis's sanctuaries. M. Jost proposed that the temples on borders are associated with Artemis as a huntress and separating her from the temples in low, marshy areas honoring her as a fertility goddess. However, Frontisi proposed that the location represents the goddess's realm as transitioning between nature and civilization.\n\nThe goddess's reputation as not only a protector but a huntress becomes much clearer in fourth-century statuary. Though the two Piraeus Artemises are portrayed in long dresses, it is perfectly clear from her bow and quiver that she is a huntress, while other statues of Artemis depict her in a short or double-belted dress and indicate a more active Artemis.\n\nThe goddess was both wild and a peaceful, a key aspect of civilization, and these statues reflect this idea by showing her as strong and womanly, approachable and dangerous, capable of protecting or punishing her worshippers.\n\n\nThe taller of the two Artemis statues, a quiver strap runs diagonally over the figure's right shoulder and under her left arm. There is a trace of lead solder on the strap on the statue’s back, which shows where the quiver was attached. Her hand still contains a lump of clay that was used to anchor her bow. There are also two small, bronze remnants of a phiale (offering bowl) that she would have held in her upturned right hand. This stance is in fact one of the stances in which Artemis and Apollo were often portrayed in Greek art.\n\nThough the Artemis A's design seems to be derived from an archaic model, there are clear Classical terms with which the artist chose to portray the statue. For example, the figure is shown with a Polyclitan stance, as indicated from most of her weight resting mainly on the right leg, leaving the left leg to bend and step to the side. The arms seem to be able to move independently of the figure's torso, judging by the way her arms are outstretched. Her head tilts to the side as well, leading the Caroline Houser to interpret the stance of the statue as a way of creating an illusion of an animate statue.\n\nThe goddess wears a peplos; a dress made of one piece of uncut fabric that drapes around the body, falling in folds. The dress folds at the shoulders, hanging doubled over to her hips and held down by round drapery weights.\nMost of her left foot and sandal is exposed due to her stance, while only her toes are shown on the right foot. However, the sandal straps have disappeared, as they were cast separately from the rest of the shoe.\nThe statue's features are extremely elaborate as well, and separately cast from the rest of the bronze statue. Her lips are made of copper-rose, and part to reveal teeth made of white marble, while her bronze lashes frame eyes made of marble and chestnut irises. However, due to the condition of the irises the statue looks cross-eyed.\nHer hair is coiffed in the 'melon' style; the wavy hair has been parted into equal sections, twisted and pulled back, and then combed into two large braids and coiled around the top of her head.\n\n\nThis is the smaller of the two Artemises and the smallest of the bronze statues found in the Piraeus excavation. In keeping with Greek art, the sculptor took a traditional form and recast it, resulting in a figure with a recognizable but original design.\nThis statue is the least well-preserved of the statues found in the Piraeus cache; the bronze has crumbled slightly, and other sections have separated completely. The right side of her head is also slightly disfigured due to swelling.\nThe figure is in a similar stance to that of Artemis A, but rather than taking a Polyclitan stance, Artemis B's stance is clearly Praxitelean. However, unlike the Artemis A, whose gaze is more uniform and slightly to the right, Artemis B turns much more dramatically to the right, her head tilted and focused in the direction of her outstretched right arm. She looks almost fully rotated, creating a real sense of movement to the viewer's eye. Her arms also seem to be positioned farther from her body in comparison to the other statues found in the Piraeus cache. Her left hand is positioned to hold a bow, and, like with Artemis A, evidence of a bronze circle attached to her thumb indicates that she held a phial in her right hand.\n\nHere, rather than the two straps that cross around Artemis A's chest, only one strap crosses over the figure's right shoulder and under her left arm, supporting part of the quiver that is still intact. The quiver itself was cast separately from the rest of the statue and had to be reattached to the statue at some point in antiquity, setting the quiver in a slightly different position than it had been originally. The quiver strap itself is also elaborate; it is decorated with a meander and dot pattern with silver inlay.\n\nThe figure wears a belt around her waist that is tied in a knot in the front. The knot was cast separately from the torso, made from cut and hammered bronze. This goddess also wears a peplos that was made separately from the skirt underneath, as well as a cloak that wraps around her right shoulder and across her back, hanging past her left hip.\n\nThe Artemis B wears a Hellenistic hairstyle similarly coiled to that of Artemis A, though the coils of hair lie somewhat higher on her head.\n\n"}

Its names arose from the fact that it increases productivity, especially of individual office workers, from typists to knowledge workers, although its scope is now wider than that. Office suites, which brought word processing, spreadsheet, and relational database programs to the desktop in the 1980s, are the core example of productivity software. They revolutionized the office with the magnitude of the productivity increase they brought as compared with the pre-1980s office environments of typewriters, paper filing, and handwritten lists and ledgers. Some 78% of \"middle-skill\" occupations (those that call for more than a high school diploma but less than a bachelor's degree) now require the use of productivity software. In the 2010s, productivity software has become even more consumerized than it already was, as computing becomes ever more integrated into daily personal life.\n\nProductivity software traditionally runs directly on a computer. For example, Commodore Plus/4 model of computer contained in ROM for applications of productivity software. Productivity software is one of the reasons people use personal computers.\n\nProductivity software can fall into the following categories:\n\nTime Management Software: With time management software, one is able to track time on a desktop without any user intervention. This allows the person to analyse how much time is spent on each task and what one can do to re-prioritise his tasks and spend time on the most important tasks. \n\nProject Management Software: With project management software, one is able to delegate, track major projects and have a quick overview of the progress made by each team member.\n\nAn office suite is a collection of bundled productivity software (a software suite) intended to be used by knowledge workers. The components are generally distributed together, have a consistent user interface and usually can interact with each other, sometimes in ways that the operating system would not normally allow.\n\nThe earliest office suite for personal computers was Starburst in the early 1980s, comprising the word processor WordStar, together with companion apps CalcStar (spreadsheet) and DataStar (database). Various other suites arose in the 1980s, and over the course of the 1990s Microsoft Office came to dominate the market, a position it retains .\n\nExisting office suites contain wide range of various components.

This gave VeriSign the advantage of receiving greater revenue from advertising and from users wishing to register these domain names. It had the effect of \"capturing\" the web traffic for several million mis-typed or experimental web accesses per day, and meant that VeriSign effectively \"owned\" all possible .com and .net domains that had not been bought by others, and could use them as an advertising platform.\n\nVeriSign described the change as an attempt to improve the Web browsing experience for the naive user. VeriSign's critics saw this claim as disingenuous. Certainly, the change led to a dramatic increase in the amount of Internet traffic arriving at verisign.com. According to the web traffic measurement company Alexa, in the year prior to the change verisign.com was around the 2,500th most popular website. In the weeks following the change, the site came into the top 20 most popular sites, and reached the top 10 in the aftermath of the change and surrounding controversy.\n\nThere was a storm of controversy among network operators and competing domain registrars, particularly on the influential NANOG and ICANN mailing lists, some of whom asserted:\n\nOthers were concerned that the Site Finder service was written entirely in English and therefore was not accessible by non-English speakers.\n\nThe Internet Architecture Board composed a document detailing many of the technical arguments against registry-level wildcards; this was used by ICANN as part of its supporting arguments for its action.\n\nA number of workarounds were developed to locally disable the effects of Site Finder on a per-network basis. Most notably, the Internet Systems Consortium announced that it had produced a version of the BIND DNS software that could be configured by Internet service providers to filter out wildcard DNS from certain domains; this software was deployed by a number of ISPs.\n\nOn October 4, 2003, as a result of a strong letter from ICANN, VeriSign disabled Site Finder. However, VeriSign has made public statements that suggest that they may be considering whether they will change this decision in the future. On February 27, 2004, VeriSign filed a lawsuit against ICANN, claiming that ICANN had overstepped its authority. The claim regarded not only Site Finder, but also VeriSign's much-criticised Wait Listing Service. The claim was dismissed in August 2004; parts of the lawsuit continued, and culminated in a March 1, 2006 settlement between VeriSign and ICANN which included \"a new registry agreement relating to the operation of the .COM registry.\"\n\nOn July 9, 2004, the ICANN \"Security and Stability Advisory Committee\" (SSAC) handed down its findings after an investigation on Site Finder. It found that the service should not be deployed before ICANN and/or appropriate engineering communities were offered the opportunity to review a proposed implementation, and that domain name registries that provide a service to third parties should phase out wildcard records if they are used.\n\n"}

He was a headliner in many territories, and was best known in Memphis, Tennessee, where he and Billy Wicks set an attendance record that lasted until the Monday Night Wars boom period.\n\nMonroe was born in Dodge City, Kansas. His father was killed in an airplane crash one month before his birth. His formative years were spent living with his grandparents. Later, his mother remarried, and his stepfather, whose last name was Brumbaugh, adopted him at age 17. As a result, Monroe's legal name became Roscoe Monroe Brumbaugh.\n\nHe had a brother, Gary \"Jet\" Monroe, who was his manager during certain parts of his career.\n\nDebuting as Rock Monroe in 1945, Monroe began his career by wrestling in traveling carnivals. He changed his name to Rocky Monroe in 1949, and adopted the nickname \"Sputnik\" in 1957.\n\nMonroe was a noteworthy figure in Memphis cultural history. During a period where legal segregation was the norm at public events, and during a general decline in the popularity of professional wrestling, Monroe recognized that the segregated wrestling shows (whites sat in floor seats while blacks were required to sit in the balcony) were not properly marketing to black fans. The witty, flamboyant Monroe began dressing up in a purple gown and carrying a diamond tipped cane and drinking in traditionally black bars in the black area of Memphis. As a result of this, he was frequently arrested by police on a variety of trumped up charges, such as mopery. He would then hire a black attorney and appear in court, pay a fine, and immediately resume fraternizing with black citizens and drinking in their bars. Due to this, and in spite of the fact that he was a heel at the time, his popularity soared among the black community. At his shows, although floor seats in arenas would be half empty with white patrons, the balcony would be packed to capacity with black patrons with many others unable to enter due to the balcony selling out.\n\nMonroe, having become the biggest wrestling draw in the territory, soon refused to perform unless patrons, regardless of their race, were allowed to sit in any seat at the Ellis Auditorium. As a result, promoters were obliged to desegregate his wrestling shows, which then completely sold out with Monroe's black fans filling the auditorium. Soon, other southern sporting events, recognizing the enormous financial benefits, began to desegregate as well.\n\nMonroe had three children, the youngest of them, Quentin Bell was also a pro wrestler. Monroe trained him.\n\nMonroe died in his sleep on November 3, 2006 in Florida. He was 77 years old. In May 2007, HBO announced that they would make a film based on Monroe's life. In September 2007, Julien Nitzberg confirmed that the first draft of the film's script had been completed.\n\n\n"}

It is a trivia book, consisting largely of little-known facts about various animals, alongside factual corrections to \"other\" pieces of supposedly \"well-known\" trivia that, although widely believed, are not always accurate. It is a sequel to \"The Book of General Ignorance\".\n\nThe Book of Animal Ignorance was first published in the UK by Faber and Faber on 4 October 2007, almost exactly a year after \"The Book of General Ignorance\", and clearly targeted towards the same Christmas market. An American printing is likely to be forthcoming, since the success of \"General Ignorance\" in the UK Christmas market 2006 reputedly prompted \"a two-book, six-figure\" sale of the US publication rights, although the UK edition is already available through Amazon.com.

This change in style may be dictated simply by the content, but could also be as a direct result of criticism directed at the former title by Marcus Berkmann, referring to its disappointing similarity in format to a number of titles, and specifically New Scientist's 2005 book \"Does Anything Eat Wasps?\"\n\nTouted on the cover as being \"from the team that brought 'Ignorance' to millions\", it promised to be a \"bestiary for the 21st century,\" and contains almost-completely new \"quite interesting\" facts on 100 different animals, described in Fry's introduction as \"the oats in the \"QI\" muesli\". This new style and emphasis on new material clearly demonstrates the evolution of the \"QI\" brand, moving as it does away from the look of the initial book, a far more obvious simple rehashing of content from the TV series ('\"General Ignorance\" round), rather than being a complementary companion volume in its own right, as is \"Animal Ignorance\".\n\n\"Animal Ignorance\" again features forewords from both regular QI personalities, Stephen Fry and Alan Davies. In contrast to the preceding books' \"Four words,\" Davies here contributes a 'proper' foreword, labelled a \"Forepaw\", in keeping with the book's subject matter. It comprises two-page spreads on 100 diverse mammals, reptiles, rodents, fish, birds and other beasts ranging from aardvark to worm (and not strictly \"Aardvark to Zebra\" as initially reported). The book was designed, typeset also illustrated (with \"400 diagrams and cartoons\") \"by the brilliant Ted Dewan\".\n\n\"QI: The Book of Animal Ignorance\" was one of 51 titles to make \"The 2007 Exclusive Books List\" (\"formerly the \"Publisher's Choice\" list\") of \"the best books to give or get\" at Christmas, 2007.\n\n"}

Douglas Campbell and Leonard Sbrocchi (1987).\n\nA company of actors under the direction of Doctor Hinkfuss is to present an improvisation on Pirandello's novella \"Leonora, Addio!\" Hinkfuss explains that his plan for having the actors improvise, as the spirit moves them, is an attempt to allow the work to stage itself, with characters rather than actors. However, his actors are frustrated at the conflict inherent in Hinkfuss's instructions: to completely become their characters, but also to come when they are called and adapt themselves to Hinkfuss's decisions about what should happen when.\n\nAfter some argument between the actors and Hinkfuss, the play begins. It concerns the La Croce family – Signor Palmiro, a sulfur mine engineer, his forceful wife Signora Ignazia, and their four daughters, Mommina, Totina, Dorina, and Nenè – who have moved from Naples to the more socially conservative Sicily. The family is popular with a local company of air force officers, who love the mother and flirt with the daughters; however, this behavior earns the family the disapproval of the rest of the town, as well as of Rico Verri, one of the other officers.\n\nOne night, Signor Palmiro is brought home bleeding by a cabaret singer whom he loves, after having been stabbed defending her honor, and dies. This having coincided with a fight among the actors as to how much they should keep to the script, the Old Comic Actor's entrance is ruined, and the actors, angry at Hinkfuss's meddling, throw him out of the theatre.\n\nThe next scene takes place years later. Mommina has married Rico Verri, who is mad with jealousy over what he imagines to be her sexual history with the other officers. After he abuses her and leaves, Mommina – guided by the offstage voices of her mother and sisters – finds a handbill in his coat advertising a production of \"Il Trovatore\" in which Totina, now a famous opera singer, is performing. She describes the theatre to her two children, who have never seen it, and tells them the story of the opera, singing snatches of it, with her heart beating ever faster and her breath growing ever weaker, until she sings Manrico's line in the Act IV farewell duet – \"Leonora, addio!\" – and falls dead.\n\nThe other actors end the play, running on to find Mommina dead. They believe that the Lead Actress has fainted, but she gets up, and after the actors insist on written parts, Doctor Hinkfuss, who has returned, apologizes to the audience for the night's irregularities.\n"}

By its peak in 1929, it employed almost 1,500 representatives in Great Britain and worldwide, selling the work of a team of photographers operating first from Fleet Street and then at Red Lion Court in London. As well as contemporary press photography, the company also focused on sales of stock images. With changing patterns in news publishing, the company dwindled until it eventually went bankrupt in 1957, with the bulk of the archives acquired by the Hulton Picture Library, now part of Getty Images.\n\nProminent photographers worked for \"Topical\" including Arthur William Debenham, Hugh Cecil Saunders, and John Warwick Brooke, who was one of the first official British photographers of the First World War, among others.\n\n"}

They are decorated with a caricature, and featured below an insulting poem. Ostensibly given on Valentine's Day, the caricature and poem is about the \"type\" that the recipient belongs to—spinster, floozy, dude, scholar, etc. They enjoyed popularity from the 1840s to the 1940s.\n\nThese cynical, sarcastic, often mean-spirited greeting cards were first produced in America as early as the 1840s by a variety of printing companies, including Elton, Fisher, Strong and Turner. By the 1870s, other entrepreneurs such as New York printer, John McLoughlin, and his cartoonist, Charles Howard were creating their own lines of cards. While different European companies also produced the humorous cards in the early 19th century, one of the most prestigious firms to create them around 1900 was Raphael Tuck & Sons, \"Publishers to Their Majesties the King and Queen of England.\"\n\nCheaply made, vinegar valentines were usually printed on one side of a single sheet of paper and cost only a penny. Some people mistakenly call them penny dreadfuls, but that term refers to a form of potboiler fiction. They often featured garish caricatures of men like the \"Dude\" or women like the \"Floozy.\" One reason they rapidly became popular throughout America and Europe was because literacy rates were increasing at that time among the poor and working classes who rarely had much more than a penny to spend on such luxuries. But, according to noted valentine authority Nancy Rosin, president of the National Valentine Collectors Association, their use wasn't restricted to the lower economic classes.\n\nThe unflattering cards reportedly created a stir throughout all social levels, sometimes provoking fisticuffs and arguments. The receiver, not the sender, was responsible for the cost of postage up until the 1840s. A person in those days paid for the privilege of being insulted by an often anonymous \"admirer.\" Millions of vinegar valentines, with verses that insulted a person's looks, intelligence, or occupation, were sold between the 19th and 20th centuries. Art and design historian Annebella Pollen has extensively researched their production and reception in Britain, where they were more commonly called 'mock' or 'mocking' valentines.\n\nThe cards are usually simply a sheet of thin, colored paper, about the size of a modern greeting card. They were later also produced in the form of postcards. They were usually sent anonymously. Postmasters sometimes confiscated these cards as unfit to be mailed.\n\nAt the end of the 1940s and 50s, the cost of the vinegar valentines was five cents.\n\nThe cards were first produced in the late Victorian era and enjoyed their greatest popularity in that period and in the first quarter of the 20th century.\n\nOne pop culture reference to vinegar valentines is found in Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes comic strip. Calvin often gives Susie Derkins vinegar valentines.\n\n\n\n\"Happy Valentine's Day: I Hate You\", Collectors' Weekly, http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/happy-valentines-day-i-hate-you/\n\n\"Love Letters and Hate Mail\", Brighton Museums, http://brightonmuseums.org.uk/discover/category/authors/annebella-pollen/\n\n\"The valentine has fallen upon evil days: mocking Victorian Valentines and the ambivalent laughter of the carnivalesque\", Early Popular Visual Culture http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17460654.2014.924212 Also available at: http://eprints.brighton.ac.uk/13357/\n\nBBC coverage of the phenomenon, with examples of nineteenth century cards and a radio interview with vinegar valentines historian, Annebella Pollen: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/34JCKJtrl07f5kY3G9kFNpd/eight-incredibly-offensive-victorian-valentines\n"}

It is sometimes called the current working directory (CWD), e.g. the BSD function, or just current directory. When the process refers to a file using a simple file name or relative path (as opposed to a file designated by a full path from a root directory), the reference is interpreted relative to the current working directory of the process. So for example a process with working directory /rabbit-shoes that asks to create the file foo.txt will end up creating the file /rabbit-shoes/foo.txt.\n\nIn most computer file systems, every directory has an entry (usually named \".\") which points to the directory itself.\n\nIn most DOS and UNIX command shells, as well as in the Microsoft Windows command line interpreters cmd.exe and Windows PowerShell, the working directory can be changed by using the cd or chdir commands. In Unix shells, the pwd command outputs a full pathname of the current working directory; the equivalent command in DOS and Windows is cd without arguments (whereas in Unix, cd used without arguments takes the user back to his/her home directory).\n\nThe environment variable PWD (in Unix/Linux shells), or the pseudo-environment variables CD (in Windows COMMAND.COM and cmd.exe, but not in OS/2 and DOS), or _CWD, _CWDS, _CWP and _CWPS (under 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT etc.) can be used in scripts, so that one need not start an external program. Microsoft Windows file shortcuts have the ability to store the working directory.\n\nCOMMAND.COM in DR-DOS 7.02 and higher provides ECHOS, a variant of the ECHO command omitting the terminating linefeed. This can be used to create a temporary batchjob storing the current directory in an environment variable like CD for later use, for example:codice_1 Alternatively, under Multiuser DOS and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher, various internal and external commands support a parameter /B (for \"Batch\"). This modifies the output of commands to become suitable for direct command line input (when redirecting it into a batch file) or usage as a parameter for other commands (using it as input for another command). Where CHDIR would issue a directory path like codice_2, a command like CHDIR /B would issue codice_3 instead, so that CHDIR /B > RETDIR.BAT would create a temporary batchjob allowing to return to this directory later on.\n\nThe current working directory is also displayed by the $P token of the codice_4 command To keep the prompt short even inside of deep subdirectory structures, the DR-DOS 7.07 COMMAND.COM supports a $W token to display only the deepest subdirectory level. So, where a default PROMPT $P$G would result f.e. in codice_5 or codice_6, a PROMPT $N:$W$G would instead yield codice_7 and codice_8, respectively. A similar facility (using $W and $w) was added to 4DOS as well.\n\nMost programming languages provide an interface to the file system functions of the operating system, including the ability to set (change) the working directory of the program.\n\nIn the C language, the POSIX function codice_9 effects the system call which changes the working directory. Its argument is a text string with a path to the new directory, either absolute or relative to the old one. Where available, it can be called by a process to set its working directory.\n\nThere is the same function in other languages. In Visual Basic it is usually spelled codice_10.\n\nUnlike the Windows API or POSIX C function, neither the Java programming language nor the Java Virtual Machine supports codice_9 directly; a change request remained open for over a decade while the team responsible for Java considered the alternatives, though by 2008 the request was denied after only limited support was introduced (affecting first codice_12 and later, codice_13).\n\n\n\n"}
