They are sometimes called witches' marks, a term also used to denote identifying marks once thought to be found on the bodies of witches.\n\nApotropaic marks (from Greek \"apotrepein\" \"to ward off\" from \"apo-\" \"away\" and \"trepein\" \"to turn\") are symbols or patterns scratched into the fabric of a building with the intention of keeping witches out through apotropaic magic. Evil was thought to be held at bay through a wide variety of apotropaic objects such as amulets and talismans against the evil eye. Marks on buildings were one application of this type of belief.\n\nMarks have been found at Shakespeare's Birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon, at the Tower of London, and many churches, but little effort has been made to find them on secular buildings. The marks are most common near places where witches were thought to be able to enter, whether doors, windows or chimneys. For example, during works at Knole House in 1609, oak beams beneath floors, particularly near fireplaces, were scorched and carved with scratched witch marks to prevent witches and demons from coming down the chimney. At the Bradford-on-Avon Tithe Barn, a flower-like pattern of overlapping circles is incised into a stone in the wall. Similar marks of overlapping circles have been found on a window cill dated about 1616 at Owlpen Manor in Gloucestershire.\n\nOther types of mark include the intertwined letters V and M or a double V (for the protector, the Virgin Mary, alias \"Virgo Virginum\"), and crisscrossing lines to confuse any spirits that might try to follow them.\n\n"}

The declaration did not receive recognition from the international community.\n\nOn 10 October, in the aftermath of the 1 October 2017 Catalan independence referendum, a document establishing Catalonia as an independent republic was signed by the members of Catalonia's pro-independence parliamentary majority. The same document was voted for on 27 October by a majority of 70 out of 135 MPs in a plenary session (10 voted against, 2 abstained and 53 had left the Parliament before the voting as a sign of protest).\n\nFifty-three MPs from the opposition refused to be present during the 27 October voting, after the legal services of the Catalan Parliament advised that the voting could not take place as the law on which it was based had been suspended by the Spanish Constitutional Court.\n\nA few hours later, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain dismissed Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and his cabinet, and called for fresh Catalan elections on 21 December 2017. The Deputy Prime Minister of Spain Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría was assigned to be the acting president of Catalonia until the December elections.\n\nThe Law on the Referendum on Self-determination of Catalonia contained the provision that, in case of an outcome in favour of independence, independence was to be declared within 48 hours after all votes were counted. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont confirmed this on October 3 during an exclusive interview with the BBC, saying \"we are going to declare independence 48 hours after all official results are counted\".\nFinal results were published by the Catalan government on October 6, and Puigdemont announced he would formally address the Parliament on October 10.\n\nPuigdemont was widely expected to declare the independence of Catalonia, which led to worldwide coverage of the parliament session.\n\nAfter saying that he considered the referendum valid and binding, Puigdemont chose to use the wording \"I assume the mandate of the people for Catalonia to become an independent state in the shape of a republic\", before adding that he would \"ask Parliament to suspend the effects of the declaration of independence so that in the coming weeks we can undertake a dialogue\".\nThe speech left observers bewildered as they struggled to understand whether Puigdemont had just declared independence. While some commentators stated that independence had just been declared and put on hold, others stated that the declaration of independence had been postponed.\n\nAfter Puigdemont's speech, a document titled \"Declaration from the representatives of Catalonia\" declaring Catalonia's independence was signed publicly by the members of parliament of the pro-independence political parties in the auditorium of the Parliament. The document, titled \"Declaration from the representatives of Catalonia\", sought to establish Catalonia as an independent state, and called on the international community to recognize it. It was read publicly, but it was not voted or published on the Catalan government's official journal.\n\nThe immediate reaction from the Spanish government was that \"it was inadmissible to declare independence implicitly and suspend it explicitly\". Minister of Justice Rafael Catalá called it a \"non-declaration of independence\".\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy gave a short news conference on the following day, giving Puigdemont five days to confirm whether he had declared Catalonia’s independence or not. Were the answer to be affirmative, the document provided another deadline ending on Thursday, October 19, allowing for Catalan authorities to rectify and prevent the application of Section 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would authorise Madrid to temporarily take over Catalonia’s internal affairs.\n\nAccording to Spain's Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfonso Dastis, the written declaration was legally void, as it was not voted and it was signed outside of a parliamentary session.\n\nOn 27 October 2017, a resolution based on the \"Declaration of the representatives of Catalonia\" declaring the independence of Catalonia was voted in the Parliament and was approved with 70 votes in favor, 10 against, and 2 blank votes. Fifty-three MPs from the opposition refused to be present during the voting after the legal services of the Catalan Parliament advised that the voting could not take place, as the law on which it was based had been suspended by the Spanish Constitutional Court. The two pro-independence parties, JxSí and CUP, had 72 seats, and the vote in favour of independence obtained 70.\n\nOn 30 October, Parliament Speaker Carme Forcadell called off a parliamentary meeting scheduled for the next day because the chamber \"had been dissolved\", thus acknowledging Mariano Rajoy's order. Later that day, it transpired that Puigdemont and part of his dismissed cabinet had fled to Belgium in a move to avoid action from the Spanish judiciary, as the Spanish Attorney General José Manuel Maza announced a criminal complaint against them for rebellion, sedition and embezzlement. Concurrently, lack of civil unrest and work resuming as normal throughout Catalonia showed signs that direct rule from Madrid had taken hold, with Spanish authorities reasserting administrative control over Catalan territory with little resistance.\n\nBy 31 October, the declaration of independence was fully suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain and the dismissed Catalan government accepted the elections proposed by Mariano Rajoy. Puigdemont and part of his cabinet fled to Belgium in a self-imposed exile to avoid being prosecuted by the Spanish judiciary, having been formally accused of rebellion, sedition and embezzlement by the Spanish Attorney General.\n\nOn 2 November, the judge Carmen Lamela of the Spanish National Court ordered that eight members of the deposed Catalan government including the ex-vice-president Oriol Junqueras be remanded in custody without bail. Additionally, Santi Vila, who was the Business Minister that resigned over the unilateral declaration of independence, was granted a €50,000 bail. The prosecution requested issuing European Arrest Warrants for Puigdemont and four other members who left Catalonia for Brussels shortly after the declaration.\n\nThe Catalan elections were held on 21 December and parties supporting independence again won a majority.\n\nOn 23 March 2018, Spanish Judge Llarena jailed five more Catalan ministers. On 25 March, Puigdemont was detained in Germany but released some days later, after the state court in Schleswig rejected extraditing him for rebellion.\n\nCatalan independence has received no recognition from any sovereign nation. However, the partially recognized, non-UN-member states Abkhazia and South Ossetia claimed they were willing to offer formal recognition should they receive a request to do so from the Catalan government. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14768031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14768031", "title": "DNS hijacking", "text": "DNS hijacking\n\nDNS hijacking or DNS redirection is the practice of subverting the resolution of Domain Name System (DNS) queries. This can be achieved by malware that overrides a computer's TCP/IP configuration to point at a rogue DNS server under the control of an attacker, or through modifying the behaviour of a trusted DNS server so that it does not comply with internet standards.\n\nThese modifications may be made for malicious purposes such as phishing, or for self-serving purposes by Internet service providers (ISPs) and public/router-based online DNS server providers to direct users' web traffic to the ISP's own web servers where advertisements can be served, statistics collected, or other purposes of the ISP; and by DNS service providers to block access to selected domains as a form of censorship. \n\nOne of the functions of a DNS server is to translate a domain name into an IP address that applications need to connect to an Internet resource such as a website. This functionality is defined in various formal internet standards that define the protocol in considerable detail. DNS servers are implicitly trusted by internet-facing computers and users to correctly resolve names to the actual addresses that are registered by the owners of an internet domain.\n\nA rogue DNS server translates domain names of desirable websites (search engines, banks, brokers, etc.) into IP addresses of sites with unintended content, even malicious websites. Most users depend on DNS servers automatically assigned by their ISPs. Zombie computers use DNS-changing trojans to invisibly switch the automatic DNS server assignment by the ISP to manual DNS server assignment from rogue DNS servers. A router's assigned DNS servers can also be altered through the remote exploitation of a vulnerability within the router's firmware. When users try to visit websites, they are instead sent to a bogus website. This attack is termed pharming. If the site they are redirected to is a malicious website, masquerading as a legitimate website, in order to fraudulently obtain sensitive information, it is termed phishing.\n\nA number of consumer ISPs such as AT&T, Cablevision's Optimum Online, Comcast, CenturyLink, Time Warner, Cox Communications, RCN, Rogers, Charter Communications, Plusnet, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile US, Virgin Media, Frontier Communications, Bell Sympatico, UPC, T-Online, Optus, Mediacom, ONO, TalkTalk, Bigpond (Telstra), TTNET, Türksat, and Telkom Indonesia use DNS hijacking for their own purposes, such as displaying advertisements or collecting statistics. Dutch ISP's XS4ALL and Ziggo use DNS hijacking by court order: they were ordered to block access to The Pirate Bay and display a warning page instead. These practices violate the RFC standard for DNS (NXDOMAIN) responses, and can potentially open users to cross-site scripting attacks.\n\nThe concern with DNS hijacking involves this hijacking of the NXDOMAIN response. Internet and intranet applications rely on the NXDOMAIN response to describe the condition where the DNS has no entry for the specified host. If one were to query the invalid domain name (for example www.example.invalid), one should get an NXDOMAIN response - informing the application that the name is invalid and taking the appropriate action (for example, displaying an error or not attempting to connect to the server). However, if the domain name is queried on one of these non-compliant ISPs, one would always receive a fake IP address belonging to the ISP. In a web browser, this behavior can be annoying or offensive as connections to this IP address display the ISP redirect page of the provider, sometimes with advertising, instead of a proper error message. However, other applications that rely on the NXDOMAIN error will instead attempt to initiate connections to this spoofed IP address, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n\nExamples of functionality that breaks when an ISP hijacks DNS:\n\nIn some cases, the ISPs provide subscriber-configurable settings to disable hijacking of NXDOMAIN responses. Correctly implemented, such a setting reverts DNS to standard behavior. Other ISPs, however, instead use a web browser cookie to store the preference. In this case, the underlying behavior is not resolved: DNS queries continue to be redirected, while the ISP redirect page is replaced with a counterfeit dns error page. Applications other than web-browsers cannot be opted out of the scheme using cookies as the opt-out targets only the HTTP protocol, when the scheme is actually implemented in the protocol-neutral DNS system.\n\nIn the UK, the Information Commissioner's Office have acknowledged that the practice of involuntary DNS hijacking contravenes PECR, and EC Directive 95/46 on Data Protection which require explicit consent for processing of communication traffic. However they have refused to intervene, claiming that it would not be sensible to enforce the law, because it would not cause significant (or indeed any) demonstrable detriment to individuals.\n\nICANN, the international body responsible for administering top-level domain names, has published a memorandum highlighting its concerns, and affirming: \n\nEnd users, dissatisfied with poor \"opt-out\" options like cookies, have responded to the controversy by finding ways to avoid spoofed NXDOMAIN responses. DNS software such as BIND and Dnsmasq offer options to filter results, and can be run from a gateway or router to protect an entire network. Google, among others, run open DNS servers that currently do not return spoofed results. So a user could use Google Public DNS instead of their ISP's DNS servers if they are willing to accept that they use the service under Google's privacy policy and potentially be exposed to another method by which Google can track the user. One limitation of this approach is that some providers block or rewrite outside DNS requests. OpenDNS, owned by Cisco, is a similar popular service which does not alter NXDOMAIN responses.\n\nGoogle in April 2016 launched DNS-over-HTTPS service. This scheme can overcome the limitations of the legacy DNS protocol. It performs remote DNSSEC check and transfers the results in a secure HTTPS tunnel.\n\nThere are also application level work-arounds, such as the NoRedirect Firefox extension that mitigate some of the behavior. An approach like that only fixes one application (in this example, Firefox) and will not address any other issues caused. Website owners may be able to fool some hijackers by using certain DNS settings. For example, setting a TXT record of \"unused\" on their wildcard address (e.g. *.example.com). Alternatively, they can try setting the CNAME of the wildcard to \"example.invalid\", making use of the fact that '.invalid' is guaranteed not to exist per the RFC. The limitation of that approach is that it only prevents hijacking on those particular domains, but it may address some VPN security issues caused by DNS hijacking.\n\n"}

The card contains some basic information about the immigrant: name, birth date, sex, immigrant category, country of birth, photo, immigrant registration number (also called \"A-number\"), card number, restrictive terms and conditions, and dates of validity. This document, however, should not be confused with the green card.\n\nTo request an Employment Authorization Document, noncitizens who qualify may file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. Applicants must then send the form via mail to the USCIS Regional Service Center that serves their area. If approved, an Employment Authorization Document will be issued for a specific period of time based on alien's immigration situation.\n\nThereafter, USCIS will issue Employment Authorization Documents in the following categories: \n\nFor employment-based green card applicants, the priority date needs to be current to apply for Adjustment of Status (I-485) at which time an Employment Authorization Document can be applied for. Typically, it is recommended to apply for Advance Parole at the same time so that visa stamping is not required when re-entering US from a foreign country.\n\nAn interim Employment Authorization Document is an Employment Authorization Document issued to an eligible applicant when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has failed to adjudicate an application within 90 days of receipt of a properly filed Employment Authorization Document application or within 30 days of a properly filed initial Employment Authorization Document application based on an asylum application filed on or after January 4, 1995. The interim Employment Authorization Document will be granted for a period not to exceed 240 days and is subject to the conditions noted on the document.\n\nAn interim Employment Authorization Document is no longer issued by local service centers. One can however take an INFOPASS appointment and place a service request at local centers, explicitly asking for it if the application exceeds 90 days and 30 days for asylum applicants without an adjudication.\n\nThe eligibility criteria for employment authorization is detailed in the Federal Regulations section 8 C.F.R. §274a.12. Only aliens who fall under the enumerated categories are eligible for an employment authorization document. Currently, there are more than 40 types of immigration status that make their holders eligible to apply for an Employment Authorization Document card. Some are nationality-based and apply to a very small number of people. Others are much broader, such as those covering the spouses of E-1, E-2, E-3, or L-1 visa holders.\n\nThe category includes the persons who either are given an Employment Authorization Document incident to their status or must apply for an Employment Authorization Document in order to accept the employment.\n\n\nThe following persons do not qualify for an Employment Authorization Document, nor can they accept any employment in the United States, unless the incident of status may allow.\n\n\nThe following persons do not qualify for an Employment Authorization Document, even if they are authorized to work in certain conditions, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service regulations (8 CFR Part 274a). Some statuses may be authorized to work only for a certain employer, under the term of 'alien authorized to work for the specific employer incident to the status', usually who has petitioned or sponsored the persons' employment. In this case, unless otherwise stated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, no approval from either the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is needed.\n\n\nUndocumented immigrants have been considered a source of low-wage labor, both in the formal and informal sectors of the economy. However, in the late 1980s with an increasing influx of un-regulated immigration, many worried about how this would impact the economy and, at the same time, citizens. Consequently, in 1986, Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act \"in order to control and deter illegal immigration to the United States\" resulting increasing patrolling of U.S. borders. Additionally, the Immigration Reform and Control Act implemented new employment regulations that imposed employer sanctions, criminal and civil penalties \"against employers who knowingly [hired] illegal workers\". Prior to this reform, employers were not required to verify the identity and employment authorization of their employees; for the very first time, this reform \"made it a crime for undocumented immigrants to work\" in the United States. \n\nThe Employment Eligibility Verification document (I-9) was required to be used by employers to \"verify the identity and employment authorization of individuals hired for employment in the United States\". While this form is not to be submitted unless requested by government officials, it is required that all employers have an I-9 form from each of their employees, which they must be retain for three years after day of hire or one year after employment is terminated.\n\nConccurrently, the Immigration Act of 1990 “increased the limits on lawful immigration to the United States,\" [...] \"established new nonimmigrant admission categories,\" and revised acceptable grounds for deportation. Most importantly, it brought to light the \"authorized temporary protected status\" for aliens of designated countries.\n\nThrough the revision and creation of new classes of nonimmigrants, qualified for admission and temporary working status, both IRCA and the Immigration Act of 1990 provided legislation for the regulation of employment of noncitizen.\n\nThe 9/11 attacks brought to the surface the weak aspect of the immigration system. After the September 11 attacks, the United States intensified its focus on interior reinforcement of immigration laws to reduce illegal immigration and to identify and remove criminal aliens.\n\nUndocumented Immigrants are individuals in the United States without lawful status. When these individuals qualify for some form of relief from deportation, individuals may qualify for some form of legal status. In this case, temporarily protected noncitizens are those who are granted \"the right to remain in the country and work during a designated period\". Thus, this is kind of an \"in-between status\" that provides individuals temporary employment and temporary relief from deportation, but it does not lead to permanent residency or citizenship status. Therefore, an Employment Authorization Document should not be confused with a legalization document and it is neither U.S. permanent resident status nor U.S. citizenship status. The Employment Authorization Document is given, as mentioned before, to eligible noncitizens as part of a reform or law that gives individuals temporary legal status\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a deep water fish, ranging between about , and is found in the northern Atlantic and northern Pacific Oceans. It has a variety of other English vernacular names including black halibut, blue halibut, lesser halibut and Newfoundland turbot.\n\nThe Greenland halibut is a flatfish, and the left eye has migrated during the fish's development so that it is on the right side of the head. However, in this fish, it has not moved as far as in bottom-dwelling flatfish and the fish can probably see forwards. The Greenland halibut can swim in a vertical position and both sides of its body are a speckled brown colour, but the left side is rather paler than the right. This fish is used for human consumption and is caught mostly by trawling. Greenpeace considers the fishery unsustainable and has added the Greenland halibut to its seafood red list. This designation is widely considered to be based upon limited and unverifiable data.\n\nIts morphology with the left eye positioned on the dorsal ridge of the forehead gives it an appearance of a cyclops when looking straight at it. The central position of the left eye in the Greenland halibut probably gives it a much wider range of peripheral vision in comparison to other flatfish where the eye has migrated completely. The body shape is elongated and compressed dorsal-ventrally and muscles on both sides are equally developed. Both sides are pigmented; however the left blind side is slightly lighter in color than the right side. The maximum length is about 120 cm and the maximum weight is about 45 kg, the normal length is 80–100 cm and they usually weigh 11–25 kg.\n\nIts physical appearance suggests it to be a vigorous swimmer that can swim in a vertical position. Vertical swimming has been observed during tagging experiments. However, video analyzing of Greenland halibut behavior in front of a bottom trawl showed no sign of swimming in a vertical position. Even though most Greenland halibut are caught in bottom fishing gears (trawl, longline and gillnet) they have also been caught in surface drift nets which indicates that they can have a pelagic occurrence. Stomach analysis has also shown that the diet consists mostly of pelagic or bathypelagic organisms. Even though the Greenland halibut is a flatfish it does at times behave more like a roundfish.\n\nIt is a deepwater fish distributed mostly from 200 to 1600 m, but has been caught in deeper depths of . It is mainly found in waters with temperatures from 1-4 °C, but has also observed at sub-zero temperatures down to -2.1 °C. It has a circumpolar distribution in the Northern Hemisphere and is found in both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific oceans. In the North Pacific it ranges from the Sea of Japan near Honshu northwards to the Chukchi Sea, east through the Aleutian Islands, and south as far as northern Baja California in Mexico. In the North Atlantic it occurs from England to northern Norway, Iceland and eastern Greenland in the east and from Newfoundland to north-western Greenland in the west.\n\nThe Greenland halibut is an arctic species which is found at depths of 200–2000 m, mainly between 500m and 1000m. However, it is often caught pelagically and it is thought that it swims on its ventral edge rather than on the blind side. It is an active, mid-water predator which feeds on prawns, fish such as Atlantic cod, Artic cod, eelpouts, capelin and redfish), and squid. It spawns at depths of 700–1500 m during spring and summer, from April to July at temperatures of 3-5 °C. Its eggs, larvae, and postlarvae are free-floating in deep water. The larvae complete their metamorphosis on attaining a length of 6-8.5 cm; the young fish tend to occur in the shallower areas than the adults.\n\nIn 2010, Greenpeace International has added the Greenland halibut to its seafood red list. \"The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries. Although in 2017 the Marine Stewardship Council certified that the fishery for Greenland halibut was sustainable. This species is mainly caught using long lines. The meat is regarded as inferior to that of the Atlantic halibut and it is marketed fresh or frozen and is normally consumed either steamed or fried. In 1999 the total landings reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization was 115,326 tonnes. The largest catches were reported from Greenland (34,481 t) and Norway (18,810 t). In 2001 1.078 tonnes were landed in Scotland with a value estimated at £1,885,000 but the Scottish Government reports that 33% of the catch is lost as the species has thick skin, high fat content and a low meat yield.\n"}
{"id": "21305887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21305887", "title": "Hag", "text": "Hag\n\nA hag is a wizened old woman, or a kind of fairy or goddess having the appearance of such a woman, often found in folklore and children's tales such as Hansel and Gretel. Hags are often seen as malevolent, but may also be one of the chosen forms of shapeshifting deities, such as the Morrígan or Badb, who are seen as neither wholly beneficent nor malevolent. \n\nThe term appears in Middle English, and was a shortening of \"hægtesse\", an Old English term for \"witch\", similarly the Dutch \"heks\" and German \"Hexe\" are also shortenings, of the Middle Dutch \"haghetisse\" and Old High German \"hagzusa\" respectively. All of these words are derived from the Proto-Germanic \"*hagatusjon-\" which is of unknown origin, however the first element may be related to the word \"hedge\". As a stock character in fairy or folk tale, the hag shares characteristics with the crone, and the two words are sometimes used as if interchangeable.\n\nUsing the word \"hag\" to translate terms found in non-English (or non-modern English) is contentious, since use of the word is often associated with misogyny.\n\nA hag, or \"the Old Hag\", was a nightmare spirit in English and anglophone North American folklore. This variety of hag is essentially identical to the Old English \"mæra\"—a being with roots in ancient Germanic superstition, and closely related to the Scandinavian \"mara\". According to folklore, the Old Hag sat on a sleeper's chest and sent nightmares to him or her. When the subject awoke, he or she would be unable to breathe or even move for a short period of time. In the Swedish film \"Marianne\", the main character suffers from these nightmares. This state is now called sleep paralysis, but in the old belief the subject had been \"hagridden\". It is still frequently discussed as if it were a paranormal state.\n\nMany stories about hags seem to have been used to frighten children into being good. The Northern English Peg Powler, for example, was a river hag who lived in the River Tees and had skin the colour of green pond scum. Parents who wanted to keep their children away from the river's edge told them that if they got too close to the water she would pull them in with her long arms, drown them, and sometimes eat them. This type of nixie or neck has other regional names, such as Grindylow (a name connected to Grendel), Jenny Greenteeth from Yorkshire, and Nelly Longarms from several English counties.\n\nMany tales about hags do not describe them well enough to distinguish between an old woman who knows magic or a supernatural being.\n\nIn Slavic folklore, Baba Yaga was a hag who lived in the woods in a house on chickens legs. She would often ride through the forest on a mortar, sweeping away her tracks with a broom. Though she is usually a single being, in some folktales three Baba Yagas are depicted as helping the hero in his quest, either by giving advice or by giving gifts.\n\nIn Irish and Scottish mythology, the cailleach is a hag goddess concerned with creation, harvest, the weather and sovereignty. In partnership with the goddess Bríd, she is a seasonal goddess, seen as ruling the winter months while Bríd rules the summer. In Scotland, a group of hags, known as \"The Cailleachan\" (The Storm Hags) are seen as personifications of the elemental powers of nature, especially in a destructive aspect. They are said to be particularly active in raising the windstorms of spring, during the period known as \"A Chailleach\".\n\nHags as sovereignty figures abound in Irish mythology. The most common pattern is that the hag represents the barren land, who the hero of the tale must approach without fear, and come to love on her own terms. When the hero displays this courage, love, and acceptance of her hideous side, the sovereignty hag then reveals that she is also a young and beautiful goddess.\n\nThe Three Fates (particularly Atropos) are often depicted as hags.\n\nIn Persian folklore, the Bakhtak has the same role as that of \"the Old Hag\" in English folklore. The Bakhtak sits on a sleeper's chest, awakening them and causing them to feel they are unable to breathe or even to move. Bakhtak also is used metaphorically to refer to \"nightmare\" in the modern Persian language.\n\nShe is similar to Lilith.\n\nIn mediaeval and later literature, the term \"hag\", and its relatives in European languages, came to stand for an unattractive, older woman. Building on the mediaeval tradition of such women as portrayed in comic and burlesque literature, specifically in the Italian Renaissance the hag represented the opposite of the lovely lady familiar from the poetry of Petrarch.\n\nThe hag as a fantastic creature has also been used in some fantasy novels such as the \"Harry Potter\" series by J.K. Rowling, where Hags are depicted as a species of ugly, child-eating women with numerous warts.\n\nThe expression \"Old Hag Attack\" refers to a hypnagogic state in which paralysis is present and, quite often, it is accompanied by terrifying hallucinations. When excessively recurrent, some consider this to be a disorder; however, many populations treat them as simply part of their culture and mythological world-view, rather than any form of disease or pathology.\n\n\n"}

Though he did well in maths, graduating as 8th wrangler, he finished bottom in the classical tripos at Cambridge in 1824, for which he was awarded the first \"wooden wedge\", equivalent to the wooden spoon, and jokingly named for him.\n\nAfter leaving Cambridge, Wedgwood read for the chancery bar. In 1828, he qualified as a barrister, but never practised. Between 1831 and 1837, he served as a police magistrate and sat at the Surrey magistrates' court at Union Hall, Southwark.\n\nA notable case that came before him during his tenure was that of James Pratt and John Smith in 1835, whom he committed to trial after their arrest for homosexual acts. After their trial and conviction at the Central Criminal Court, the two became the last to be executed for sodomy in England. This was in spite of Wedgwood himself calling for a commutation of their death sentences in a letter to the Home Secretary.\n\nWedgwood resigned from the magistracy after deciding that one of his duties, the administrations of oaths, was inconsistent with the commandments of the New Testament. Between 1838 and 1849, he held the post of Registrar of Metropolitan Public Carriage.\n\nHis main fields of study were philology and etymology. His \"Dictionary of Etymology\" was published in 1857. He was a founding member of the Philological Society.\n\nWedgwood became interested in spiritualism and attended séances. In 1874, he attempted to get T.H. Huxley involved in spiritualism by sending him an alleged spirit photograph. Huxley was not impressed and suggested the photograph had been produced fraudulently by the use of a second image placed on the plate inside the camera. Hensleigh refused to believe this explanation and considered the photograph to be genuine. \n\nWedgwood was a member of the British National Association of Spiritualists and a vice-president of the Society for Psychical Research.\n\nHe married Frances Emma Elizabeth \"Fanny\" Mackintosh (1800-1889) in 1832, his first cousin, the daughter of Sir James Mackintosh and his second wife Catherine \"Kitty\" Allen. They had six children:\n\n\nWedgwood died on 2 June 1891 at his house at 94 Gower Street, London. He was buried at the Church of St. Peter ad Vincula, Stoke on Trent, now known as Stoke Minster.\n\nA collection of around 550 books from his library is held by the library of the University of Birmingham. They were donated to the university by his daughter, Frances Julia Wedgwood.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40662403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40662403", "title": "Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good", "text": "Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good\n\nJean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good is a presentation miniature believed to have been painted by the Flemish artist Rogier van der Weyden (or if not actually from his hand then certainly by his workshop to his designs). It decorates the frontispiece to the \"Chroniques de Hainaut\", MS KBR.9242, a translation from Latin into French of a three volume history in of the County of Hainaut by Jean Wauquelin. The Latin text was originally written by the 14th century Franciscan historian Jacques de Guyse. \n\nThe majority, if not all, of the figures (described in the text as \"Chevaliers, conseillers, et chambellans\", are portraits of historical figures. The decorative border of the presentation miniature includes the arms of the various territories making up Philip's dukedom, which he had considerably expanded, interspersed with his personal emblem of sparks being struck from a flint.\n\nThe translation had been commissioned by Philip, and the manuscript that both contains the miniature and shows it being presented was at that point the only one existing. From the court accounts the progress of the translation (though not the decoration of the manuscript) can be traced, and the miniature is presumed to date from around the time of the actual presentation to Philip in March 1448. The entire set of three volumes are now in the Royal Library of Belgium.\n\nIt is well preserved, and the only known manuscript miniature by van der Weyden.\n\nThe \"Chronicles of Hainaut\" is an illuminated manuscript in three volumes, tracing the history of the county of Hainaut to the end of the 14th century. The text of Philip's book is a French translation made c 1446-50 by Jean Wauquelin, from the \"Annales historiae illustrium principum Hannoniæ\", a three-volume Latin work produced by Jacques de Guise c 1390-96. The book was commissioned by Simon Nockart, a councilor to Philip the Good, as a means to legitimise Philip territorial claims. It is now in the Bibliothèque royale de Belgique in Brussels. It contains ten other miniatures.\n\nThe frontpiece praises the contemporary fashion at Burgundian court, which it claims is ahead even of that of the French. Broadly the miniature can be divided into three horizontal sections, with four clerics positioned to the left, two members of royalty and Wauquelin at the center, and eight advisers and courtiers to the right. The main figures are dressed in finely tailored gowns, with pipe folds extending from the shoulders, that become tightly girdled at the waist, before they spread out into the skirt. In most cases the skirts end before the knees. Most wear a bodice, which is open from the neck to waist, and worn over a white shirt. The tops of their sleeves rise unnaturally over their shoulders, most likely due to the support of small cushions (\"mahewters\") place inside the garments. \nThe men's head-dress is intended to denote their social position, with the highest ranked wearing variants of the chaperon, a garment then at the peak of its popularity. Philip the Good wears a black looped chaperon, Rolin a less exuberant version; only he has sufficient status to wear his chaperon indoors in the Duke's presence. Apart from the Bishop of Tournai, standing next to Rolin, all the other men are bare-headed, even Philip's young heir, despite the fact that several of them are high-ranking intimates who, like the Duke, wear the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece. But as far as can be seen, all have hats. The young Charles the Bold, then around 12 or 13 years old wears his patte, or strap, wrapped round the back of his neck, and the man on the extreme right, identified as Jean de Croÿ, has his bourrelet further than usual down his back, with the patte hanging from it. The man in grey seems to be carrying a different typle of hat made of black fur, but all the other ones visible are also chaperons, mostly with the cornettes to the front. \n\nPhilip stands in front of his throne positioned under a golden or salmon coloured canopy or baldachin, lined with what appears to be green satin. He is, as usually in depictions of him, dressed almost entirely in black. He wears a black burlet (rolled) chaperon with the cornette wrapped around this neck. He holds a small hammer as a symbol of his authority in his left hand, and a baton of power in his right, while a dog sleeps at his feet. His tight chaussembles (leggings) end in long pouleines (the type of shoe with very long, pointed toes). His clothes are lined with brown fur, which is turned out to trim the cuffs and hem. His son Charles de Charolais stands to his right, dressed in a salmon gown, foreshadowing the crown he is due to inherit. Jean Wauquelin kneels before Philip, presenting a large book bound in brown leather; his translation of the Chroniques de Hainaut which he had completed in 1446. Van der Weyden some took artistic licence here, probably to vary the tonality of the dark colours; the surviving Chroniques bound in black satin. \nPhilip's preference for black is imitated by a number of the other men to the right, particularly the older nobleman at the head of the group, who is generally identified as Antoine I de Croÿ, first chamberlain of the ducal household. Most of the chaperons are black, although the man in blue has one in salmon-pink; black was having one of its earliest periods of being the most fashionable colour at the time.\n\nThe miniature bears a close resemblance to the presentation miniature by Simon Marmion for Philip's copy of the \"Grandes Chroniques de France\", in which Philip accepts many of the same figures present in the Hainaut miniature. A book for Charles the Bold of 1468–70 includes a rather crude and simplified version of van der Weyden's scene.\n\nThe richly decorated borders of the miniature detail Philip's territorial control over large areas of Northern Europe. The top of the page show his arms, mottoes, and devices, while along the sides are the arms of the different territories under his rule. They are laid out with including duchies on the left side (including Burgundy, Lotharingia and Limbourg), and counties on the right (including Flanders, Artois and Franche-Comté).\n\nIt is well preserved but with some losses. There is some small amounts of decay to the paint to the head of the unidentified old man behind Antoine de Croÿ, as well as to the head of the white haired knight. Over time some of the colours have darkened, especially on some of the brighter elements of Philip's garments.\n\nThere are no extant examples of manuscript miniatures by Van der Weyden, excepting a single tapestry, all of the attributed works are panel painting. Yet in the early to mid 14th century, artists often worked in a variety of mediums. In both Tournai and Brussels, where he is known to have been active, illuminators and panel painters were part of the same guild. He studied under Robert Campin and alongside Jacques Daret, both of whom are known to have produced miniatures. \n\nThe miniature is about the same size of van der Weyden smallest panel works. The workmanship is of the very highest quality and precision. An example of the attention to detail are the several concentric contour lines added to the tail of the dozing dog, making it appear to wag. It was copied in other presentation miniatures, some showing Charles the Bold older or in adulthood.\n\nThe association with van der Weyden was first established by Gustav Friedrich Waagen and is now is generally accepted by art historians. His attribution was based not only on the quality of execution, but also on the portrait evidence of some of the figures. Most of these can be identified, and among them Bishop (2nd from left), Chancellor Nicolas Rolin (3rd from left), Philip the Good (centre, 4th from left), and Charles the Bold (5th from left) appear in portraits by van der Weyden or his workshop, although in the case of Charles the Bold he appears as just an 11-year-old boy in the miniature. The group on the right probably include Anthony, bastard of Burgundy and Antoine de Croy. \n\n"}

Beginning his working life as a mathematically trained civilian instructor for the Royal Navy, he later became Professor of Modern History at King's College London and a co-founder of the Navy Records Society. A prolific writer of lives, he penned the biographies of more than 900 naval personalities for the \"Dictionary of National Biography\".\n\nLaughton was born in Liverpool on 23 April 1830, the second son and youngest child of a former Master Mariner, James Laughton of Liverpool (1777–1859).\n\nIn 1866 Laughton married his first wife, Isabella, daughter of John Carr of Dunfermline. They had one son and three daughters. In 1886 Laughton married his second wife, Maria Josefa, daughter of Eugenio di Alberti, of Cadiz, Spain; they had three sons and two daughters, one of whom was Vera Laughton Mathews.\n\nHe died at home at Wimbledon in his eighty-sixth year on 14 September 1915.\n\nLaughton was educated at the Royal Institution School, Liverpool, and then at Caius College, Cambridge, graduating BA (34th wrangler) in 1852. He served with the Royal Navy as a civilian shipboard instructor teaching mathematics, science and navigation, and saw combat in the Baltic and Far East campaigns. In 1866 he finished his sea days by going ashore to teach at the Royal Naval College in Portsmouth. When the College moved to the new Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1873, Laughton moved with it to become Head of the Department of Meteorology and Marine Surveying.\n\nIn the 1870s Laughton turned more and more to teaching and lecturing on history, delivering a now famous lecture to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in 1874 on the importance of actually analysing historical events, rather than merely reporting events chronologically. This was a new idea at the time and would not have been seen then as stating the obvious, as perhaps it would today. With this new approach, Laughton ‘acted as a catalyst for [the] entire intellectual development' of naval history as an independent discipline.\n\nDuring his time as a lecturer in naval history, Laughton was undoubtedly an influence on the more famous naval historian-strategists of his age – Alfred Thayer Mahan, Julian Corbett and Herbert Richmond. Mahan, who has been described as \"one of Laughton's disciples\", wrote of him that \"He probably knows more naval history than any English speaking man living\". In 1885 he left the Royal Navy to accept the position of Professor of Modern History at King's College, London. He succeeded in convincing the Admiralty to allow limited public access to their archives. Together with Admiral Cyprian Bridge, Laughton co-founded the Navy Records Society in 1893. He was the Society's first Secretary, and was knighted for his work in 1907.\n\nLaughton died at the age of 85 on 14 September 1915 and was buried at sea in the Thames Estuary from the decks of HMS \"Conqueror\".\n\nLaughton's contributions to naval history were largely forgotten until the pioneering work by Canadian naval historian Donald Mackenzie Schurman \"The Education of a Navy: The Development of British Naval Strategic Thought, 1867–1914\" (1965) resurrected his memory. Professor Andrew Lambert has since added to this with a work, \"The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy and the Historical Profession\".\n\nUnlike Mahan and Corbett, Laughton never wrote a major work, and the body of work that he did leave behind went out of print and until online editions became available was very difficult to come by. The measure of his significance comes by looking at the people he influenced and the institutions which he left behind after his death. Through 'long-term influence and personal contact' with other thinkers in the field and British admirals, he managed to sow the seeds in influential people’s minds that naval history was a subject worth studying, something which had relevance and bearing on modern naval affairs. The Navy Records Society remains a key part of the discipline of naval history.\n\nIn recognition of his importance, King's College Department of War Studies has named its naval history chair as the \"Laughton Professor\", and naval historians in the department belong to the Laughton Unit \".\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a component of the National Union for Independence, which in turn is one of the two components of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS).\n\nPalika started on the radical left, with Marxist rhetoric, in the 1970s. It participated, like the Caledonian Union (UC), in the Nationalist Front and later the FLNKS as the smaller, but more radical element. After the Matignon Accords, the division between Palika and UC heightened, and in 1995 Paul Néaoutyine led a dissident list (National Union for Independence, UNI) from the FLNKS' united list in the North Province. In 1999, the Palika and UC ran separate lists in all provinces. At the same time, the Palika became more moderate, favouring talks with loyalists but still having as a final goal full independence (as opposed to Free association supported by UC). \n"}

The high white marble statue was made around 530 BC and originally was colourfully painted. The statue was found, in three pieces, in an 1886 excavation north-west of the Erechtheion on the Athenian Acropolis and is now in the Acropolis Museum in Athens.\n\nThe Peplos Kore (\"peplos\" being the type of robe or shawl-like fabric draped over the figure and \"kore\" meaning a girl or young female) stands at approximately high. It is carved from fine grained Parian marble. Traces remain of the original paint.\n\nThe name of the statue comes from the heavy woolen garment worn by the girl (Greek: κόρη, \"kore\"), the Dorian peplos, which was no longer actually in fashion when the marble statue was made. Underneath it, the girl wears a thin chiton which peeps out from the sleeves and hem. Bore holes on the head and shoulders indicate that the statue was decorated with bronze head decorations (probably a wreath) and shoulder fibulae. The left arm was made of a separate piece of stone and is now lost.\n\nThe Peplos Kore is ascribed to the \"Rampin Master\" who is named for another head, very similar in style, which was in the Rampin Collection and is now on display in the Louvre.\n\nIn Brinkmann's opinion, this statue type does not depict mortal girls but goddesses. Her posture does not correspond to the late archaic Kore, \"who steps forward with her left leg, holds her skirt with her left hand and holds fruit in the crook of her right arm.\"\" On the Peplos Kore, there are bore holes in the lowered right arm and the bent left arm which suggest she held a bow and arrows or a shield and helmet. \n\nA number of other similar kore statues (plural \"korai\") have been discovered at the Acropolis, dating to as early as the early 6th century BCE. Some have suggested that patrons commissioned the kore statues to serve as offerings to worshiped deities, as votive figures who stand in their place. Wealthier individuals used the kore statues as grave markers for deceased family members. The figure's “perfect symmetry and unearthly expression\" suggests that the Peplos Kore may represent an ideal youthful embodiment of the deceased person's soul, rather than a physical likeness. But the Peplos Kore has distinct differences from the other discovered kore figures; the work is dressed in a particular manner, leading some archaeologists to suggest that the statue was a goddess representation.\n\nThe statue is carved in the round, but designed to be seen from the front, with many details, especially in the facial features. The face displays an “archaic smile” similar to many Greek statues from the Archaic period. Webster's Dictionary has defined an archaic smile as “an expression that resembles a smile and is characteristic of early Greek sculpture”. The kore statues depict young, clothed female figures, in contrast to their male counterparts, the kouros figures which are presented as muscular nude males.\n\nIn 1975, the Museum of Classical Archaeology attempted to replicate the sculpture’s original appearance by painting a cast of the figure. The replica was then displayed next to a second, unpainted cast to demonstrate the difference between the pure white marble that is commonly associated with Greek sculpture and the brightly-painted version that is probably closer to reality.\n\n\n\n"}

It is now an exhibition building at Shelburne Museum in Shelburne, Vermont.\n\nThe Wagner Palace Car Company fabricated the rail car \"Grand Isle\" in April 1899 for Dr. William Seward Webb, president of the company from 1885 to 1899. The wood clad business car was initially listed as Rutland RR 500 Grand Isle. Although Webb was trained as a physician, his father-in-law, William Henry Vanderbilt, persuaded him to give up the medical profession and join the family’s railroad enterprise instead. As president of the Wagner Palace Car Company and then the Rutland Railroad from 1902-1905, Webb lived for part of the year in Shelburne, Vermont, from whence he commuted with relative ease to New York City. \"Grand Isle\" was one of a group of rail cars owned by Webb. Among them, others made by Wagner included the \"Ellsmere\", constructed in 1888, and the \"Mariquita\", converted to a nursery car for a trip with family and friends between California and Alaska in 1888-89.\n\nWebb later presented the \"Grand Isle\" to former Vermont Governor and Central Vermont Railway president Edward C. Smith. The car’s mahogany-paneled parlor, elegant dining room, staterooms, and plush furnishings typified the private luxury cars that became important symbols of rank to railroad men, business tycoons, and public figures in the final quarter of the 19th century.\n\nWhen the Museum purchased the \"Grand Isle\" in 1960, its paneling had been painted, its fixtures replaced, and its lush fittings removed to convert it to use as a business car. J. Watson Webb, Jr., Dr. Webb’s grandson, supervised the car’s renovation ensuring that it would once again embody the days of luxury rail travel and commemorate his family’s role in the railroad industry.\n\n\n"}

It was published for the first time in 1942. Fleischer wanted to create a book that would keep fans informed about the history of boxing and their favorite fighters, and, at the same time, help fighters' managers and promoters choose who their protégé's next opponent should be. It also included a detailed history of title fights for each division, and a section of a list of boxing record setters.\n\nWith time, the book would also include round by round scoring for each title fight held on the year prior. At its peak, the book consisted of close to 600 pages of records and stats. \n\nAfter Fleischer died in 1972, Stanley Weston took over the production and edition of the yearly encyclopedia book. During this period, \"Ring Record book and boxing Encyclopedia\"s were hard-cover books, with a glossy, outside cover that had color photos of famous modern fighters of the era.\n\nIn 1990, \"The Ring\" magazine went bankrupt, and the \"Ring Encyclopedia\" stopped being produced. In 1992, \"The Ring\" magazine returned to the stands, but it wasn't until 1994 that the encyclopedia returned.\n\nThe new version of the \"Ring Record Book and Boxing Encyclopedia\" is a smaller, pocket sized book with a different context separating it from the original one. It is a soft cover book that covers the history of each division, but including only the fights where world titles changed hands. It also includes a recap of title fights held the year before, but without the judges' scorecards for any of the fights. It only has the records of current world champions (except WBO ones, as \"The Ring\" magazine has always refused to recognize WBO world champions as such), and of leading contenders. It also has a recap of \"Ring\"'s articles of the past twelve months. Currently, the encyclopedic books are edited by Steve Farhood.\n\nThe original version of the encyclopedia, which was a mail-order item, topped at a price of 25 dollars. Many books in the original format are now collector's items, and as such, their prices have gone up. The new version usually sells for 5 dollars at many supermarkets and other stores.\n"}

{"id": "930136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=930136", "title": "Source (journalism)", "text": "Source (journalism)\n\nIn journalism, a source is a person, publication, or other record or document that gives timely information. Outside journalism, sources are sometimes known as \"news sources\". Examples of sources include official records, publications or broadcasts, officials in government or business, organizations or corporations, witnesses of crime, accidents or other events, and people involved with or affected by a news event or issue.\n\nAccording to Shoemaker (1996) and McQuail (1994), there are a multitude of factors that tend to condition the acceptance of sources as bona fide by investigative journalists. Reporters are expected to develop and cultivate sources, especially if they regularly cover a specific topic, known as a \"beat\". Beat reporters must, however, be cautious of becoming too close to their sources. Reporters often, but not always, give greater leeway to sources with little experience. For example, sometimes a person will say they don't want to talk, and then proceed to talk; if that person is not a public figure, reporters are less likely to use that information. Journalists are also encouraged to be skeptical without being cynical as per the saying \"If your mother says she loves you, check it out.\" popularized by the City News Bureau of Chicago. As a rule of thumb, but especially when reporting on controversy, reporters are expected to use multiple sources.\n\nOff-the-record material is often valuable and reporters may be eager to use it, so sources wishing to ensure the confidentiality of certain information are generally advised to discuss the \"terms of use\" before actually disclosing the information, if possible. Some journalists and news organizations have policies against accepting information \"off the record\" because they believe it interferes with their ability to report truthfully, or because they suspect it may be intended to mislead them or the public.\n\nEven if they cannot report certain information directly, journalists can use \"off the record\" information to uncover related facts, or to find other sources that \"are\" willing to speak on the record. This is especially useful in investigative journalism. Information about a surprise event or breaking news, whether on or off the record, is known as a \"tip-off\". Information that leads to the uncovering of more interesting information is called a \"lead\".\n\nThe identity of anonymous sources is sometimes revealed to senior editors or a news organization's lawyers, who would be considered bound by the same confidentiality. (Lawyers are generally protected from subpoena in these cases by attorney–client privilege.) Legal staff may need to give counsel about whether it is advisable to publish certain information, or about court proceedings that may attempt to learn confidential information. Senior editors are in the loop to prevent reporters from fabricating non-existent anonymous sources and to provide a second opinion about how to use the information obtained, how or how not to identify sources, and whether other options should be pursued.\n\nThe use of anonymous sources has always been controversial. Some news outlets insist that anonymous sources are the only way to obtain certain information, while others hold strict prohibitions against the use of unnamed sources at all times. News organizations may impose safeguards, such as requiring that information from an anonymous source be corroborated by a second source before it can be printed.\n\nNonetheless, prominent reports based on anonymous sources have sometimes proven to be incorrect. For instance, much of the O. J. Simpson reporting from unnamed sources was later deemed inaccurate. \"Newsweek\" retracted a story about a Qur'an being flushed down a toilet that led to riots in the Middle East; the Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 was based upon one unnamed military source. The \"Los Angeles Times\" retracted an article that implicated Sean \"Diddy\" Combs in the beating of Tupac Shakur. The original article was based on documents and several unnamed sources. When reporting on the original story, the Associated Press noted that \"[n]one of the sources was named\".\n\nAfter the embarrassment, a news organization will often \"clamp down\" on the guidelines for using unnamed sources, but those guidelines are often forgotten after the scandal dies down. One study found that large newspapers' use of anonymous sources dropped dramatically between 2003 and 2004. The Project for Excellence in Journalism, a research group found use of anonymous sources dropped from 29 percent of all articles in 2003 to just 7 percent in 2004.\n\nWhether in a formal, sit-down interview setting or an impromptu meeting on the street, some sources request that all or part of the encounter not be captured in an audio or video recording (\"tape\"), but continue speaking to the reporter. As long as the interview is not confidential, the reporter may report the information given by the source, even repeating direct quotes (perhaps scribbled on a notepad or recalled from memory). This often shows up in broadcasts as \"John Brown declined to be interviewed on camera, but said\" or simply \"a spokesperson said\".\n\nSome interview subjects are simply uncomfortable being recorded. Some are afraid that they will be inarticulate and make fools of themselves when the interview is broadcast. Others might be uncooperative or distrust the motives or competence of the journalist, and wish to prevent them from being able to broadcast an unflattering sound bite or part of the interview out of context. Professional public relations officers know that having the reporter repeat their words, rather than being on the air themselves, will blunt the impact of their words. The audience need not see or hear them being uncomfortable (if they have unpleasant news), and not being on air also allows them to be anonymous or identified only by title.\n\nIn journalism, attribution is the identification of the source of reported information. Journalists' ethical codes normally address the issue of attribution, which is sensitive because in the course of their work journalists may receive information from sources who wish to remain anonymous. In investigative journalism important news stories often depend on such information. For example, the Watergate scandal that led to the downfall of U.S. president Richard Nixon was in part exposed by information revealed by an anonymous source (\"Deep Throat\") to investigative reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.\n\nDivulging the identity of a confidential source is frowned upon by groups representing journalists in many democracies. In many countries, journalists have no special legal status, and may be required to divulge their sources in the course of a criminal investigation, like any other citizen would be. Even in jurisdictions which grant journalists special legal protections, journalists are typically required to testify if they bear witness to a crime.\n\nJournalists defend the use of anonymous sources for a variety of reasons:\n\nHowever, the use of anonymous sources is also criticized by some journalists and government officials:\n\nThere are several categories of \"speaking terms\" (agreements concerning attribution) that cover information conveyed in conversations with journalists. In the UK the following conventions are generally accepted:\n\n\nHowever, confusion over the precise meaning of \"unattributable\" and \"off-the-record\" has led to more detailed formulations:\n\n\n\n"}

It is 2.61 m high and is now in the Salone dei Cinquecento of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence.\n\nThe exact date of execution of the statue is unknown, but it is usually related to the project for the tomb of Julius II. It is thought to have been intended for one of the lower niches of one of the last projects for the tomb, perhaps that of 1532 for which the \"Slaves\" now in the Galleria dell'Accademia of Florence were also made. On the other hand, the monument may have been coupled with a similar pair of fighters, a clay model in the Casa Buonarroti – the so-called .\n\nWith the famous statue unfinished, \"Victory\" forms an interesting footnote in history: left in the artist's studio after his final departure from Florence in 1534, it became the property of his nephew Leonardo Buonarroti, who first tried to sell it in 1544 without obtaining the necessary authorization from his uncle. Then, at the suggestion of Daniele da Volterra, he tried to place it on Michelangelo's tomb in Santa Croce (1564), but Giorgio Vasari, who was redesigning the church's interior, was against it being used there. Vasari suggested giving the statue to Duke Cosimo I de' Medici, as in fact happened that year. If the Slaves from Julius's tomb ended up in Buontalenti's Grotto in the Boboli Gardens, the \"Victory\" came to decorate the Salone dei Cinquecento of the Palazzo Vecchio. It was placed along the wall, among the statues of the Labors of Hercules by Vincenzo de' Rossi and others.\n\nIn 1868, three years after the opening of the National Museum of the Bargello, the statue was included in the collection of Florentine sculpture gathered in the museum. It was returned to the Palazzo Vecchio on 6 November 1921, now placed in a niche in the modern center of the back wall of the room, where, since the time Florence had been the capital of Italy (1865), the 19th-century statue of Savonarola had stood (now in Piazza Savonarola). Only in recent years has the \"Victory\" been restored to its former position along the right wall.\n\nThe dating and attribution of the statue to the project of the tomb are based on stylistic elements that link the work to the Slaves: the twisting of the body and the vigorous anatomy, as well as comparable proportions. In addition, the head has a crown of oak leaves that allude to the Della Rovere emblem.\nThe sculpture does not represent a moment of fighting, but rather serves as an allegory of victoriousness. It depicts the winner who dominates the submissive loser with great agility, with one leg that blocks the body of the captive, who is folded and chained. The young man who is the genius is beautiful and elegant, while the dominated man is old and bearded, with a flabby body and a resigned expression. The surfaces are treated expressively to enhance the contrast between the two figures: the young polished to perfection, the old rough and incomplete, still retaining the impression of the heavy stone from which it was made.\n\nAccording to some scholars, the model for the titular figure was Tommaso dei Cavalieri , a young Roman nobleman known by Michelangelo in Rome in 1532, to whom he dedicated love poems, and the older figure alludes to Michelangelo himself. \n\n"}

Along with the German-language \"Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart\", it is one of the largest reference works on western music. Originally published under the title A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, and later as Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, it has gone through several editions since the 19th century and is widely used. In recent years it has been made available as an electronic resource called Grove Music Online, which is now an important part of Oxford Music Online.\n\n\"A Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" was first published in four volumes (1879, 1880, 1883, 1889) edited by George Grove with an Appendix edited by J. A. Fuller Maitland in the fourth volume. An Index edited by Mrs. E. Wodehouse was issued as a separate volume in 1890. In 1900, minor corrections were made to the plates and the entire series was reissued in four volumes, with the index added to volume 4. The original edition and the reprint are now freely available online. Grove limited the chronological span of his work to begin at 1450 while continuing up to the present day.\n\nThe second edition (\"Grove II\"), in five volumes, was edited by Fuller Maitland and published from 1904 to 1910, this time as \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\". The individual volumes of the second edition were reprinted many times. An \"American Supplement\" edited by Waldo Selden Pratt and Charles N. Boyd was added in 1920. This edition removed the first edition's beginning date of 1450, though important earlier composers and theorists are still missing from this edition. These volumes are also now freely available online.\nThe third edition (\"Grove III\"), also in five volumes, was an extensive revision of the 2nd edition; it was edited by H. C. Colles and published in 1927.\n\nThe fourth edition (\"Grove IV\"), also edited by Colles, was published in 1940 in five volumes (a reprint of the third edition, with some corrections). In addition to the \"American Supplement\", Macmillan also published (in New York and London) a \"Supplementary Volume\" edited by Colles.\n\nThe fifth edition (\"Grove V\"), in nine volumes, was edited by Eric Blom and published in 1954. This was the most thoroughgoing revision of the work since its inception, with many articles rewritten in a more modern style and a large number of entirely new articles. Many of the articles were written by Blom personally, or translated by him. An additional Supplementary Volume, prepared for the most part by Eric Blom, followed in 1961. Blom died in 1959, and the Supplementary Volume was completed by Denis Stevens. The fifth edition was reprinted in 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973, and 1975.\n\nThe next edition was published in 1980 under the name \"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" and was greatly expanded to 20 volumes with 22,500 articles and 16,500 biographies. Its senior editor was Stanley Sadie with Nigel Fortune also serving as one of the main editors for the publication.\n\nIt was reprinted with minor corrections each subsequent year until 1995, except 1982 and 1983. In the mid-1990s, the hardback set sold for about $2,300. A paperback edition was reprinted in 1995 which sold for $500.\n\nSome sections of \"The New Grove\" were also issued as small sets and individual books on particular topics. These typically were enhanced with expanded and updated material and included individual and grouped composer biographies, a four-volume dictionary of American music (1984; revised 2013, 8 vols.), a three-volume dictionary of musical instruments (1984), and a four-volume dictionary of opera (1992).\n\nThe second edition under this title (the seventh overall) was published in 2001, in 29 volumes. It was also made available by subscription on the internet in a service called Grove Music Online. It was again edited by Stanley Sadie, and the executive editor was John Tyrrell. It was originally to be released on CD-ROM as well, but this plan was dropped. As Sadie writes in the preface, \"The biggest single expansion in the present edition has been in the coverage of 20th-century composers\".\n\nThis edition has been subject to negative criticism (e.g. in \"Private Eye\") owing to the significant number of typographical and factual errors that it contains. Two volumes were re-issued in corrected versions, however, after production errors originally caused the omission of sections of Igor Stravinsky's worklist and Richard Wagner's bibliography.\n\n\nPublication of the second edition of \"The New Grove\" was accompanied by a Web-based version, \"Grove Music Online\". It too, attracted some initial criticism, for example for the way in which images were not incorporated into the text but kept separate.\n\nCurrently, the complete text of \"The New Grove\" is available to subscribers to the online service \"Grove Music Online\".\n\"Grove Music Online\" includes a large number of revisions and additions of new articles. In addition to the 29 volumes of \"The New Grove\" second edition, \"Grove Music Online\" incorporates the four-volume \"New Grove Dictionary of Opera\" (ed. Stanley Sadie, 1992) and the three-volume \"New Grove Dictionary of Jazz\", second edition (ed. Barry Kernfeld, 2002), \"The Grove Dictionary of American Music\" and \"The Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments\", comprising a total of more than 50,000 articles. The current editor-in-chief of Grove Music, the name given to the complete slate of print and online resources that encompass the Grove brand, is University of Pittsburgh professor Deane Root. He assumed the editorship in 2009.\n\nThe dictionary, originally published by Macmillan, was sold in 2004 to Oxford University Press. Since 2008 \"Grove Music Online\" has served as a cornerstone of Oxford University Press's larger online research tool \"Oxford Music Online\", which remains a subscription-based service. As well as being available to individual and educational subscribers, it is available for use at many public and university libraries worldwide, through institutional subscriptions.\n\n\"Grove Music Online\" identifies itself as the Eighth Edition of the overall work.\n\n\"The New Grove\" is often the first source that English-speaking musicologists use when beginning research or seeking information on most musical topics. Its scope and extensive bibliographies make it exceedingly valuable to any scholar with a grasp of the English language.\n\nThe print edition of \"The New Grove\" costs between $1,100 and $1,500, while an annual subscription to Grove Music Online is $295.\n\nThe companion four-volume series, \"New Grove Dictionary of Opera\", is the main reference work in English on the subject of opera.\n\nIts principal competitor is the \"Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart\" (\"MGG\"), currently ten volumes on musical subjects and seventeen on biographies of musicians, written in German.\n\nThe 2001 edition contains:\n\n\nTwo non-existent composers have appeared in the work:\n\nDag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup was the subject of a hoax entry in the 1980 \"New Grove\". Esrum-Hellerup's surname derives from a Danish village and a suburb of Copenhagen. The writer of the entry was Robert Layton. Though successfully introduced into the encyclopaedia, Esrum-Hellerup appeared in the first printing only: soon exposed as a hoax, the entry was removed and the space filled with an illustration. In 1983, the Danish organist Henry Palsmar founded an amateur choir, the Esrum-Hellerup Choir, along with several former pupils of the Song School, St. Annae Gymnasium in Copenhagen.\n\nGuglielmo Baldini was the name of a non-existent composer who was the subject of a hoax entry in the 1980 edition. Unlike Esrum-Hellerup, Baldini was not a modern creation: his name and biography were in fact created almost a century earlier by the renowned German musicologist Hugo Riemann. The \"New Grove\" entry on Baldini was supported by a fictional reference in the form of an article supposedly in the \"Archiv für Freiburger Diözesan Geschichte\". Though successfully introduced into the encyclopaedia, Baldini appeared in the first printing only: soon exposed as a hoax, the entry was removed.\n\nSeven parody entries, written by contributors to the 1980 edition, and full of musical puns and dictionary in-jokes, were published in the February 1981 issue of \"The Musical Times\" (which was also edited by Stanley Sadie at the time). These entries never appeared in the dictionary itself and are:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49942", "title": "Theurgy", "text": "Theurgy\n\nTheurgy (; from , \"theourgía\") describes the practice of rituals, sometimes seen as magical in nature, performed with the intention of invoking the action or evoking the presence of one or more deities, especially with the goal of achieving henosis (uniting with the divine) and perfecting oneself.\n\n\n\"Theurgy\" means \"divine-working\". The first recorded use of the term is found in the mid-second-century neo-Platonist work the \"Chaldean Oracles\" (Fragment 153 des Places (Paris, 1971): 'For the theourgoí do not fall under the fate-governed herd'). The source of Western theurgy can be found in the philosophy of late Neoplatonists, especially Iamblichus. In late Neoplatonism, the spiritual Universe is regarded as a series of emanations from the One. From the One emanated the Divine Mind (Nous) and in turn from the Divine Mind emanated the World Soul (Psyche). Neoplatonists insisted that the One is absolutely transcendent and in the emanations nothing of the higher was lost or transmitted to the lower, which remained unchanged by the lower emanations.\n\nAlthough the Neoplatonists are considered polytheists, they embraced a form of monism.\n\nFor Plotinus, and Iamblichus' teachers Anatolius and Porphyry, the emanations are as follows:\n\nPlotinus urged contemplations for those who wished to perform theurgy, the goal of which was to reunite with the Divine (called henosis). Therefore, his school resembles a school of meditation or contemplation. Iamblichus, a student of Porphyry (who himself was a student of Plotinus) taught a more ritualized method of theurgy that involved invocation and religious, as well as magical, ritual. Iamblichus believed theurgy was an imitation of the gods, and in his major work, \"On the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians\", he described theurgic observance as \"ritualized cosmogony\" that endowed embodied souls with the divine responsibility of creating and preserving the cosmos.\n\nIamblichus' analysis was that the transcendent cannot be grasped with mental contemplation because the transcendent is supra-rational. Theurgy is a series of rituals and operations aimed at recovering the transcendent essence by retracing the divine 'signatures' through the layers of being. Education is important for comprehending the scheme of things as presented by Aristotle, Plato and Pythagoras. The theurgist works 'like with like': at the material level, with physical symbols; at the higher level, with mental and purely spiritual practices. Starting with correspondences of the divine in matter, the theurgist eventually reaches the level where the soul's inner divinity unites with The Divine.\n\nThe Emperor Julian (332-363) embraced Neoplatonic philosophy and worked to replace Christianity with a version of Neoplatonic paganism. Because of his untimely death and the hold mainstream Christianity had over the empire at the time, this was ultimately unsuccessful, but he did produce several works of philosophy and theology, including a popular hymn to the sun. In his theology, Helios, the sun, was the ideal example of the perfection of the gods and light, a symbol of divine emanation. He also held the mother goddess Cybele in high esteem.\n\nJulian favored ritual theurgy, with an emphasis on sacrifice and prayer. He was heavily influenced by Iamblichus' ideas.\n\nEsoteric Christianity accepts theurgy as a tradition that could greatly benefit a person. The main feat of Esoteric Christianity is to learn the mysteries of God (see Raziel) and to rise to higher consciousness in the understanding of God's relationship to individual consciousness. Theurgy, in the esoteric tradition, uses this knowledge to heighten one's own spiritual nature. In Esoteric Christianity, theurgy usually is the practice of trying to gain the knowledge and conversation of one's higher self, or Inner God, to teach one spiritual truths and wisdom from God that one couldn't learn from man (see alchemy, Kabbalah, and Theosophy). Some branches of Esoteric Christianity hold that if an Esoteric Christian, Rosicrucian or Theosophist practices it, he or she could potentially rise to the degree of Magus or Adept after a certain level of spiritual attainment. In a traditional and magical sense, theurgy is seen as the opposite of Goetia, even though many argue that they overlap. Some organizations, such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn claim to teach a type of theurgy that would help one ascend spiritually as well as understand the true nature of the self and its relation to the Divine and the Universe. The Golden Dawn has a somewhat significant historical following and influence; while it is held that many theurgists are usually solitary practitioners and seek the divine light alone through ritual and inner spiritual and psychological equilibration. Theurgy in this hermetic sense stresses the need for the individual to separate and analyze the individual components that constitute everyday consciousness and reunite them in a way that changes one's personal awareness into a state that understands and partakes in spiritual grace.\n\nFollowing a pattern very similar to the Neoplatonists, the Medieval Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah developed the concept that the Universe is regarded as a series of emanations from the Godhead, namely, the 10 sefirot. It is said that God created the world using the sephirot, pouring Divinity into creation through these \"vessels,\" which also have personality traits. The highest sefirah, Keter \"Crown\", holds the most divine light and is the least accessible to humanity. The lowest sefirah, Malkuth, is still higher than matter itself, so the parallel with Neoplatonism is not complete, but Malkuth is considered that aspect of God that can be perceived in the material world. It is also known as the Shekhinah.\n\nFor the Kabbalist, God is a single oneness, not separate \"gods\". The teaching avoids polytheism by insisting that the sephirot are not to be prayed to, but rather, to be meditated on and experienced as manifestations of how God acts in the world. They are envisioned as arranged in three columns, in a pattern called the Tree of Life. By meditating on the sephirot and praying for their unification, Kabbalists seek the theurgic goal of healing a shattered world.\n\nFor Kabbalists, the sefirot are as follows: Keter; Chokhmah \"Wisdom\"; Binah \"Understanding\"; Chesed \"loving-kindness\"; Gevurah \"Strength\"; Tiferet \"Beauty\"; Netzach \"Endurance\"; Hod \"Glory\"; Yesod \"Foundation\"; and Malkuth \"Kingdom, Sovereignty\".\n\n\n"}
