{"id": "144870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144870", "title": "Charlie Chan", "text": "Charlie Chan\n\nCharlie Chan is a fictional character created by Earl Derr Biggers. Biggers loosely based Chan on Honolulu, Hawaii, detective Chang Apana, and conceived of the benevolent and heroic Chan as an alternative to Yellow Peril stereotypes and villains like Fu Manchu. Chan is a detective for the Honolulu police, though many stories feature Chan traveling the world as he investigates mysteries and solves crimes.\n\nChan first appeared in Biggers' novels, then was featured in a number of media. Over four dozen films featuring Charlie Chan were made, beginning in 1926. The character was first portrayed by East Asian actors, and the films met with little success. In 1931, the Fox Film Corporation cast Swedish actor Warner Oland as Chan in \"Charlie Chan Carries On\"; the film became popular, and Fox went on to produce fifteen more Chan films with Oland in the title role. After Oland's death, American actor Sidney Toler was cast as Chan; Toler made twenty-two Chan films, first for Fox and then for Monogram Studios. After Toler's death, six films were made, starring Roland Winters.\n\nReaders and movie-goers of white America greeted Chan warmly, seeing him as an attractive character who is portrayed as intelligent, heroic, benevolent and honorable in contrast to the racist depictions of evil or conniving Asians which dominated Hollywood and national media. However, in later decades critics took contending views, finding that Chan, despite his good qualities, reinforces condescending Asian stereotypes such as an alleged incapacity to speak idiomatic English and a tradition-bound and subservient nature. Many found it objectionable that he was played on screen by Caucasian actors in yellowface.\n\nFilm adaptations in the 1990s have been poorly received. The character has been featured in several radio programs, two television shows, and comics.\n\nThe character of Charlie Chan was created by Earl Derr Biggers. In 1919, while visiting Hawaii, Biggers planned a detective novel to be called \"The House Without a Key\". He did not begin to write that novel until four years later, however, when he was inspired to add a Chinese-American police officer to the plot after reading in a newspaper of Chang Apana (鄭阿平) and Lee Fook, two detectives on the Honolulu police force. Biggers, who disliked the Yellow Peril stereotypes he found when he came to California, explicitly conceived of the character as an alternative: \"Sinister and wicked Chinese are old stuff, but an amiable Chinese on the side of law and order has never been used.\"\n\nThe \"amiable Chinese\" made his first appearance in \"The House Without a Key\" (1925). The character was not central to the novel and was not mentioned by name on the dust jacket of the first edition. In the novel, Chan is described as walking with \"the light dainty step of a woman\" and as being \"very fat indeed … an undistinguished figure in his Western clothes.\" According to critic Sandra Hawley, this description of Chan allows Biggers to portray the character as nonthreatening, the opposite of evil Chinese characters, such as Fu Manchu, while simultaneously emphasizing supposedly Chinese characteristics such as impassivity and stoicism. \n\nBiggers wrote six novels in which Charlie Chan appears:\n\nThe first Charlie Chan film was \"The House Without a Key\" (1926), a ten-chapter serial produced by Pathé Studios, starring George Kuwa, a Japanese actor, as Chan. A year later Universal Pictures followed with \"The Chinese Parrot\", starring Japanese actor, Kamiyama Sojin, in the starring role. In both productions, Charlie Chan's role was minimized. Contemporary reviews were unfavorable; in the words of one reviewer, speaking of \"The Chinese Parrot\", Sojin plays \"the Chink sleuth as a Lon Chaney cook-waiter … because Chaney can't stoop that low.\"\n\nIn 1929, the Fox Film Corporation optioned Charlie Chan properties and produced \"Behind That Curtain\", starring Korean actor E.L. Park. Again, Chan's role was minimal, with Chan appearing only in the last ten minutes of the film.\n\nNot until a white actor was cast in the title role in 1931 did a Chan film meet with success. In \"Charlie Chan Carries On\" Chan was played by Swedish actor Warner Oland, who had also played Fu Manchu in an earlier film. Oland, who claimed some Mongolian ancestry, played the character as more gentle and self-effacing than he had been in the books, perhaps in \"a deliberate attempt by the studio to downplay an uppity attitude in a Chinese detective.\" Oland starred in sixteen Chan films for Fox, often with Keye Luke, who played Chan's \"\", Lee Chan. Oland's \"warmth and gentle humor\" helped make the character and films popular; the Oland Chan films were among Fox's most successful. By attracting \"major audiences and box-office grosses on a par with A's\" they \"kept Fox afloat\" during the Great Depression.\n\nOland died in 1938, and the Chan film, \"Charlie Chan at the Ringside\", was rewritten with additional footage as \"Mr. Moto's Gamble\", an entry in the Mr. Moto series, another contemporary series featuring an East Asian protagonist; Luke appeared as Lee Chan, not only in already shot footage but also in scenes with Moto actor Peter Lorre. Fox hired another white actor, Sidney Toler, to play Charlie Chan, and produced eleven Chan films through 1942. Toler's Chan was less mild-mannered than Oland's, a \"switch in attitude that added some of the vigor of the original books to the films.\" He is frequently accompanied, and irritated, by his Number Two Son, Jimmy Chan, played by Sen Yung.\n\nWhen Fox decided to produce no further Chan films, Sidney Toler purchased the film rights. Producers Philip N. Krasne and James S. Burkett of Monogram Pictures produced and released further Chan films, starring Toler. The budget for these films was reduced from Fox's average of $200,000 to $75,000. For the first time, Chan was portrayed on occasion as \"openly contemptuous of suspects and superiors.\" African-American comedic actor Mantan Moreland played chauffeur Birmingham Brown in 13 films (1944–1949) which led to criticism of the Monogram films in the forties and since; some call his performances \"brilliant comic turns\", while others describe Moreland's roles as an offensive and embarrassing stereotype. Toler died in 1947 and was succeeded by Roland Winters for six films. Keye Luke, missing from the series after 1938's Mr. Moto rework, returned as Charlie's son in the last two entries.\n\nThree Spanish-language Charlie Chan films were made in the 1930s and 1950s. The first, \"Eran Trece (There Were Thirteen)\" (1931), is a Spanish-language version of \"Charlie Chan Carries On\" (1931). The two films were made concurrently and followed the same production schedule, with each scene filmed twice the same day, once in English and then in Spanish. The film followed essentially the same script as the Anglophonic version, with minor additions such as brief songs and skits and some changes to characters' names (for example, the character Elmer Benbow was renamed Frank Benbow). A Cuban production, \"La Serpiente Roja\" (The Red Snake), followed in 1937. In 1955, Producciones Cub-Mex produced a Mexican version of Charlie Chan called \"El Monstruo en la Sombra\" (Monster in the Shadow), starring Orlando Rodriguez as \"Chan Li Po\" (Charlie Chan in the original script). The film was inspired by \"La Serpiente Roja\" as well as the American Warner Oland films.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, five Chan films were produced in Shanghai and Hong Kong. In these films, Chan owns his detective agency and is aided, not by a son, but by a daughter, Manna, played first by Gu Meijun (顾梅君) in the Shanghai productions and then by Bai Yan (白燕) in postwar Hong Kong.\n\nChinese audiences also saw the original American Charlie Chan films. They were by far the most popular American films in 1930s China and among Chinese expatriates; \"one of the reasons for this acceptance was this was the first time Chinese audiences saw a positive Chinese character in an American film, a departure from the sinister East Asian stereotypes in earlier movies like \"Thief of Baghdad\" and \"Welcome Danger\", which incited riots that shut down the Shanghai theater showing it.\" Oland's visit to China was reported extensively in Chinese newspapers, and the actor was respectfully called \"Mr. Chan\".\n\nIn Neil Simon's \"Murder By Death\", Peter Sellers plays a Chinese detective called Sidney Wang, a parody of Chan.\n\nIn 1980, Jerry Sherlock began production on a comedy film to be called \"Charlie Chan and the Dragon Lady\". A group calling itself C.A.N. (Coalition of Asians to Nix) was formed, protesting the fact that non-Chinese actors, Peter Ustinov and Angie Dickinson, had been cast in the primary roles. Others protested that the film script contained a number of stereotypes; Sherlock responded that the film was not a documentary. The film was released the following year as \"Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen\" and was an \"abysmal failure.\" An updated film version of the character was planned in the 1990s by Miramax. While this Charlie Chan was to be \"hip, slim, cerebral, sexy and... a martial-arts master,\" nonetheless the film did not come to fruition. Actress Lucy Liu is slated to star in and executive-produce a new Charlie Chan film for Fox. The film has been in preproduction since 2000; as of 2009 it is slated to be produced.\n\nOn radio, Charlie Chan was heard in several different series on three networks (the NBC Blue Network, Mutual, and ABC) between 1932 and 1948. Walter Connolly initially portrayed Chan on Esso Oil's \"Five Star Theater\", which serialized adaptations of Biggers novels. Ed Begley, Sr. had the title role in N.B.C.'s \"The Adventures of Charlie Chan\" (1944–45), followed by Santos Ortega (1947–48). Leon Janney and Rodney Jacobs were heard as Lee Chan, Number One Son, and Dorian St. George was the announcer. \"Radio Life\" magazine described Begley's Chan as \"a good radio match for Sidney Toler's beloved film enactment.\"\n\n\nA \"Charlie Chan\" comic strip, drawn by Alfred Andriola, was distributed by the McNaught Syndicate beginning 24 October 1938. Andriola was chosen by Biggers to draw the character. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the strip was dropped in May 1942.\n\nOver decades, other Charlie Chan comic books have been published: Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created Prize Comics' \"Charlie Chan\" (1948) which ran for five issues. It was followed by a Charlton Comics title (four issues, 1955). DC Comics published \"The New Adventures of Charlie Chan\", a 1958 tie-in with the TV series; the DC series lasted for six issues. Dell Comics did the title for two issues in 1965. In the 1970s, Gold Key Comics published a short-lived series of Chan comics based on the Hanna-Barbera animated series.\n\nIn addition, a board game, \"The Great Charlie Chan Detective Mystery Game\" (1937), and a \"Charlie Chan Card Game\" (1939), have been released.\n\nThe character of Charlie Chan has been the subject of controversy. Some find the character to be a positive role model, while others argue that Chan is an offensive stereotype. Critic John Soister argues that Charlie Chan is both; when Biggers created the character, he offered a unique alternative to stereotypical evil Chinamen, a man who was at the same time \"sufficiently accommodating in personality... unthreatening in demeanor... and removed from his Asian homeland... to quell any underlying xenophobia.\"\n\nCritic Michael Brodhead argues that \"Biggers's sympathetic treatment of the Charlie Chan novels convinces the reader that the author consciously and forthrightly spoke out for the Chinese – a people to be not only accepted but admired. Biggers's sympathetic treatment of the Chinese reflected and contributed to the greater acceptance of Chinese-Americans in the first third of [the twentieth] century.\" S. T. Karnick writes in the \"National Review\" that Chan is \"a brilliant detective with understandably limited facility in the English language [whose] powers of observation, logic, and personal rectitude and humility made him an exemplary, entirely honorable character.\" Ellery Queen called Biggers's characterization of Charlie Chan \"a service to humanity and to inter-racial relations.\" Dave Kehr of \"The New York Times\" said Chan \"might have been a stereotype, but he was a stereotype on the side of the angels.\" Luke agreed; when asked if he thought that the character was demeaning to the race, he responded, \"Demeaning to the race? My God! You've got a \"Chinese hero!\"\" and \"[W]e were making the best damn murder mysteries in Hollywood.\"\n\nOther critics, such as Yen Le Espiritu and Huang Guiyou, argue that Chan, while portrayed positively in some ways, is not on a par with white characters, but a \"benevolent Other\" who is \"one-dimensional.\" The films' use of white actors to portray East Asian characters indicates the character's \"absolute Oriental Otherness;\" the films were only successful as \"the domain of white actors who impersonated heavily-accented masters of murder mysteries as well as purveyors of cryptic proverbs. Chan's character \"embodies the stereotypes of Chinese Americans, particularly of males: smart, subservient, effeminate.\" Chan is representative of a model minority, the good stereotype that counters a bad stereotype: \"Each stereotypical image is filled with contradictions: the bloodthirsty Indian is tempered with the image of the noble savage; the \"bandido\" exists along with the loyal sidekick; and Fu Manchu is offset by Charlie Chan.\" However, Fu Manchu's evil qualities are presented as inherently Chinese, while Charlie Chan's good qualities are exceptional; \"Fu represents his race; his counterpart stands away from the other Asian Hawaiians.\"\n\nSome argue that the character's popularity is dependent on its contrast with stereotypes of the Yellow Peril or Japanese people in particular. American opinion of China and Chinese-Americans grew more positive in the 1920s and 30s in contrast to the Japanese, who were increasingly viewed with suspicion. Sheng-mei Ma argues that the character is a psychological over-compensation to \"rampant paranoia over the racial other.\"\n\nIn June 2003, the Fox Movie Channel cancelled a planned Charlie Chan Festival, soon after beginning restoration for cablecasting, after a special-interest group protested. Fox reversed its decision two months later, and on 13 September 2003, the first film in the festival was aired on Fox. The films, when broadcast on the Fox Movie Channel, were followed by round-table discussions by prominent East Asians in the American entertainment industry, led by George Takei, most of whom were against the films. Collections such as Frank Chin's \"Aiiieeee! An Anthology of Asian-American Writers\" and Jessica Hagedorn's \"Charlie Chan is Dead\" are put forth as alternatives to the Charlie Chan stereotype and \"[articulate] cultural anger and exclusion as their animating force.\" Fox released the restored versions on DVD in 2006; as of mid-2008, Fox has released all of the extant Warner Oland titles and has begun issuing the Sidney Toler series. The first six Monogram productions, all starring Sidney Toler, were released by MGM in 2004.\n\nSome modern critics, particularly East Asian-Americans, dismiss the Charlie Chan character as \"bovine\" and \"asexual\", allowing \"white America … [to be] securely indifferent about us as men.\" Charlie Chan's good qualities are the product of what Frank Chin and Jeffery Chan call \"racist love\", arguing that Chan is a model minority and \"kissass\". Fletcher Chan, however, argues that the Chan of Biggers's novels is not subservient to white characters, citing \"The Chinese Parrot\" as an example; in this novel, Chan's eyes blaze with anger at racist remarks and in the end, after exposing the murderer, Chan remarks \"Perhaps listening to a 'Chinaman' is no disgrace.\" In the films, both \"Charlie Chan in London\" (1934) and \"Charlie Chan in Paris\" (1935) \"contain scenes in which Chan coolly and wittily dispatches other characters' racist remarks.\" Yunte Huang manifests an ambivalent attitude, stating that in the USA, Chan \"epitomizes the racist heritage and the creative genius of this nation’s culture.\" Huang also suggests that critics of Charlie Chan may have themselves, at times, \"caricatured\" Chan himself.\n\nChan's character has also come under fire for \"nuggets of fortune cookie Confucius\" and the \"counterfeit proverbs\" which became so widespread in popular culture. The Biggers novels did not introduce the \"Confucius say\" proverbs, which were added in the films, but one novel features Chan remarking: \"As all those who know me have learned to their distress, Chinese have proverbs to fit every possible situation.\" Huang Yunte gives as examples \"Tongue often hang man quicker than rope,\" \"Mind, like parachute, only function when open,\" and \"Man who flirt with dynamite sometime fly with angels.\" He argues, however, that these \"colorful aphorisms\" display \"amazing linguistic acrobatic skills.\" Like the African American \"signifying monkey,\" Huang continues, Chan \"imparts as much insult as wisdom.\" \n\nUnless otherwise noted, information is taken from Charles P. Mitchell's \"A Guide to Charlie Chan Films\" (1999). DVD releases have mostly been in box set format.\n\nThe American Western Charlie\nChinese Charlie Chan\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1353976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1353976", "title": "Christogram", "text": "Christogram\n\nA Christogram (Latin \"\") is a monogram or combination of letters that forms an abbreviation for the name of Jesus Christ, traditionally used as a religious symbol within the Christian Church.\n\nOne of the oldest Christograms is the Chi-Rho. It consists of the superimposed Greek letters chi and rho , which are the first two letters of Greek \"Christ\". It was displayed on the \"labarum\" military standard used by Constantine I in AD 312. The IX monogram () is a similar form, using the initials of the name \"Jesus (the) Christ\", as is the ΙΗ monogram (), using the first two letters of the name \"Jesus\".\n\nThere were a very considerable number of variants of \"Christograms\" or monograms of Christ in use during the medieval period, with the boundary between specific monograms and mere scribal abbreviations somewhat fluid.\n\nThe name \"Jesus\", spelt \"ΙΗΣΟΥΣ\" in Greek capitals, has the abbreviations \"IHS\" (also written \"JHS, IHC\", or \"ΙΗΣ\"), the name \"Christus\" , spelt \"ΧΡΙΣΤΟΣ\", has \"XP\" (and inflectional variants such as \"IX, XPO, XPS, XPI, XPO, XPM\"). In Eastern Christian tradition, the monogram ΙϹΧϹ (with Overline indicating scribal abbreviation) is used for in both Greek and Cyrillic tradition.\n\nA Middle Latin term for abbreviations of the name of Christ is \"chrisimus\".\nSimilarly, Middle Latin \"crismon\", \"chrismon\" refers to the Chi Rho monogram specifically.\n\nIn antiquity, the cross, i.e. the instrument of Christ's crucifixion (\"crux\", \"stauros\") was taken to be T-shaped, while the X-shape (\"chiasmus\") had different connotations.\nThere has been a lot of scholarly speculation on the development of the Christian cross, the letter Chi used to abbreviate the name of Christ, and the various pre-Christian symbolism associated with the chiasmus interpreted in terms of\n\"the mystery of the pre-existent Christ\".\n\nIn Plato's \"Timaeus\", it is explained that the two bands which form the \"world soul\" (\"anima mundi\") cross each other like the letter \"chi\", possibly referring to the ecliptic crossing the celestial equator.\nJustin Martyr in the 2nd century makes explicit reference to Plato's image in \"Timaeus\" in terms of a prefiguration of the Holy Cross. and an early testimony may be the phrase in \"Didache\", \"sign of extension in heaven\" (\"sēmeion epektaseōs en ouranōi\").\n\nAn alternate explanation of the intersecting celestial symbol has been advanced by George Latura, claiming that Plato's visible god in \"Timaeus\" is in fact the intersection of the Milky Way and the Zodiacal Light, a rare apparition important to pagan beliefs that Christian bishops reinvented as a Christian symbol.\n\nThe most commonly encountered Christogram in English-speaking countries in modern times is the Χ (or more accurately, the Greek letter chi), representing the first letter of the word \"Christ\", in such abbreviations as \"Xmas\" (for \"Christmas\") and \"Xian\" or \"Xtian\" (for \"Christian\").\n\nThe Alpha and Omega symbols may at times accompany the Chi-Rho monogram.\n\"Chrismon\" (\"chrismum\"; also \"chrismos, chrismus\") since the 17th century has been used as a New Latin term for the Chi Rho monogram.\n\nBecause the \"chrismon\" was used as a kind of \"invocation\" at the beginning of documents of the Merovingian period, the term also came to be used of the \"cross-signatures\" in early medieval charters.\n\"Chrismon\" in this context may refer to the Merovingian period abbreviation \"I. C. N.\" for \"in Christi nomine\", later (in the Carolingian period) also \"I. C.\" for \"in Christo\", and still later (in the high medieval period) just \"C.\" for \"Christus\".\n\nSt Cuthbert's coffin (late 7th century) has an exceptional realisation of the Christogram written in Anglo-Saxon runes, as ᛁᚻᛋ ᛉᛈᛋ, as it were \"IHS XPS\", with the \"chi\" rendered as the \"eolh\" rune (the old \"z\" or \"algiz\" rune) and the \"rho\" rendered as the p-rune.\n\nIn the Latin-speaking Christianity of medieval Western Europe (and so among Catholics and many Protestants today), the most common Christogram became \"IHS\" or \"IHC\", denoting the first three letters of the Greek name of Jesus, ΙΗΣΟΥΣ, \"iota-eta-sigma\", or .\n\nThe Greek letter \"iota\" is represented by I, and the \"eta\" by H, while the Greek letter \"sigma\" is either in its lunate form, represented by C, or its final form, represented by S. Because the Latin-alphabet letters \"I\" and \"J\" were not systematically distinguished until the 17th century, \"JHS\" and \"JHC\" are equivalent to \"IHS\" and \"IHC\".\n\n\"IHS\" is sometimes interpreted as meaning \"ΙΗΣΟΥΣ ΗΜΕΤΕΡΟΣ ΣΩΤΗΡ\" (\"Iēsous Hēmeteros Sōtēr,\" \"Jesus our Saviour\") or in Latin \"Jesus Hominum (or Hierosolymae) Salvator\", (\"Jesus, Saviour of men [or: of Jerusalem]\" in Latin) or connected with \"In Hoc Signo\". Such interpretations are known as backformed acronyms. Used in Latin since the seventh century, the first use of \"IHS\" in an English document dates from the fourteenth century, in The vision of William concerning Piers Plowman.\nIn the 15th century, Saint Bernardino of Siena popularized the use of the three letters on the background of a blazing sun to displace both popular pagan symbols and seals of political factions like the Guelphs and Ghibellines in public spaces (see Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus).\nThe IHS monogram with the H surmounted by a cross above three nails and surrounded by a Sun is the emblem of the Jesuits, according to tradition introduced by Ignatius of Loyola in 1541.\nEnglish-language interpretations of \"IHS\" have included \"In His Service\".\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, the most widely used Christogram is a four-letter abbreviation, ΙϹ ΧϹ — a traditional abbreviation of the Greek words for \"Jesus Christ\" (i.e., the first and last letters of each of the words , with the lunate sigma \"Ϲ\" common in medieval Greek), and written with titlo (diacritic) denoting scribal abbreviation ().\n\nOn icons, this Christogram may be split: \"ΙϹ\" on the left of the image and \"ΧϹ\" on the right. It is sometimes rendered as \"ΙϹ ΧϹ ΝΙΚΑ\", meaning \"Jesus Christ Conquers.\"\n\"ΙϹΧϹ\" may also be seen inscribed on the Ichthys. In the traditional icon of Christ Pantokrator, Christ's right hand is shown in a pose where his fingers bend and cross to form the letters ΙϹ, Χ, and Ϲ.\n\n\n"}

It is closely related to evolutionary physiology and environmental physiology. Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to Clifford Ladd Prosser, \"Comparative Physiology\nis not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a philosophy.\"\n\nOriginally, physiology focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a desire to improve medical practices. When physiologists first began comparing different species it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological principles. This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific questions is known as the Krogh Principle.\n\nC. Ladd Prosser, a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary and discussion in Garland and Carter):\n\n1. To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs.\n\n2. The use of physiological information to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of organisms.\n\n3. To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and their environments.\n\n4. To identify \"model systems\" for studying particular physiological functions.\n\n5. To use the \"kind of animal\" as an experimental variable.\n\nComparative physiologists often study organisms that live in \"extreme\" environments (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear examples of evolutionary adaptation. One example is the study of water balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney specializations.\n\nSimilarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to \"unusual\" organisms, such as very large or small ones. As an example, of the latter, hummingbirds have been studied. As another example, giraffe have been studied because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to specializations related to the regulation of blood pressure. More generally, ectothermic vertebrates have been studied to determine how blood acid-base balance and pH change as body temperature changes.\n\nIn the United States, research in comparative physiology is funded by both the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.\n\nA number of scientific societies feature sections on comparative physiology, including:\n\nKnut Schmidt-Nielsen (1915–2007) was a major figure in vertebrate comparative physiology, serving on the faculty at Duke University for many years and training a large number of students (obituary). He also authored several books, including an influential text, all known for their accessible writing style.\n\nGrover C. Stephens (1925–2003) was a well-known invertebrate comparative physiologist, serving on the faculty of the University of Minnesota until becoming the founding chairman of the Department of Organismic Biology at the University of California at Irvine in 1964. He was the mentor for numerous graduate students, many of whom have gone on to further build the field (obituary). He authored several books and in addition to being an accomplished biologist was also an accomplished pianist and philosopher.\n\n\n\n"}

Like natural languages, programming languages conform to rules for syntax and semantics.\n\nThere are thousands of programming languages and new ones are created every year. Few languages ever become sufficiently popular that they are used by more than a few people, but professional programmers may use dozens of languages in a career.\n\nMost programming languages are not standardized by an international (or national) standard, even widely used ones, such as Perl or Standard ML (despite the name). Notable standardized programming languages include ALGOL, C, C++, JavaScript (under the name ECMAScript), Smalltalk, Prolog, Common Lisp, Scheme (IEEE standard), Ada, Fortran, COBOL, SQL and XQuery.\n\nThe following table compares general and technical information for a selection of commonly used programming languages. See the individual languages' articles for further information. Please note that the following table may be missing some information.\n\nMost programming languages will print an error message or throw an exception if an input/output operation or other system call (e.g., chmod, kill) fails, unless the programmer has explicitly arranged for different handling of these events. Thus, these languages fail safely in this regard.\n\nSome (mostly older) languages require that the programmer explicitly add checks for these kinds of errors. Psychologically, different cognitive biases (e.g., optimism bias) may affect novice and experts alike and these omissions can lead to erroneous behavior.\n\nThe literature on programming languages contains an abundance of informal claims about their relative expressive power, but there is no framework for formalizing such statements nor for deriving interesting consequences. This table provides two measures of expressiveness from two different sources. An additional measure of expressiveness, in GZip bytes, can be found on the Computer Language Benchmarks Game.\nBenchmarks are designed to mimic a particular type of workload on a component or system. The computer programs used for compiling some of the benchmark data in this section may not have been fully optimized, and the relevance of the data is disputed. The most accurate benchmarks are those that are customized to your particular situation. Other people's benchmark data may have some value to others, but proper interpretation brings many challenges. The Computer Language Benchmarks Game site warns against over-generalizing from benchmark data, but contains a large number of micro-benchmarks of reader-contributed code snippets, with an interface that generates various charts and tables comparing specific programming languages and types of tests.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24274945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24274945", "title": "Cut (advertisement)", "text": "Cut (advertisement)\n\nCut is a British advertising campaign launched in 2009 by the charitable organisation Women's Aid to promote awareness of domestic violence. The campaign was created by advertising agency Grey London, and centres on a 120-second commercial starring Keira Knightley. The commercial was supported by poster and online components. \"Cut\" was directed by Joe Wright and produced by Dominic Delaney. Post-production work was handled by Big Buoy and Prime Focus. The campaign drew a significant amount of media attention, especially after advertising approval body Clearcast prohibited the short film from appearing on even post-watershed television, due to several particularly violent scenes. The title of the piece refers to the filmmaking practice of cutting.\n\n\"Cut\" opens with a young actress, played by Keira Knightley, leaving the set after a day's work. The actress drives home, wiping off her make-up in the car. When she arrives at her apartment, she calls to her boyfriend before finding a shattered mirror and a trail of blood across the floor into the kitchen. When she turns around, she sees her boyfriend's knuckles are bloodied and offers him a towel. He snaps it out of her hand. He then asks about the scenes with the leading man and whether her scenes with him \"felt real\". He cuts off her reply by throwing the towel back in her face and, when she tries to protest, strikes her to the ground and proceeds to yank her hair and kick her several times in the chest. The camera zooms out to reveal that the room is an otherwise empty set. The tagline \"Isn't it time someone called Cut\" appears, followed by the statistic that two women die as a result of domestic abuse each week, and a request for a donation of £2 a month.\n\nSince the appointment of advertising agency Grey London to handle the marketing of Women's Aid in 2005, they had worked on a number of publicity campaigns for the feminist charitable organisation. In 2006, their \"Valentine's Day\" campaign, with a budget of just £500, reached an estimated 52% of adults within the United Kingdom and generated editorial coverage worth an estimated €613,000. Comprising spots in print, posters, and radio, the campaign received wide critical acclaim, including an Aerial Award, a Euro Effie Award, and an IPA Effectiveness Award. The following year marked the launch of the \"What's it going to take?\" campaign. \"What's it going to take?\" centred on a series of images taken by British photographer Rankin, of a number of female British celebrities, including Anna Friel and Honor Blackman. Cosmetics were applied to the celebrities to give them the appearance of having been beaten. Noel Bussey of \"Campaign\" magazine said of the series: \"Many agencies pull out their best work when it's for charity, but rarely is it this effective, so well shot or so close to the brief.\" Women's Aid went to win the 2007 Campaigning Team of the Year award at the Charity Times Gala Awards in London for the work surrounding the \"What's it going to take?\" campaign.\n\nKeira Knightley had worked with director Joe Wright on a number of projects prior to \"Cut\", including the feature films \"Pride & Prejudice\" and \"Atonement\", and a 2008 television commercial for Chanel perfume. The pair volunteered their time for \"Cut\" at no charge, and convinced a team of around fifty others to do so as well. The assembled team included BAFTA-nominated make-up artist Ivana Primorac and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, whose work with Wright on \"Atonement\" earned him an Academy Award nomination. Filming took place in January 2009, and the piece was intended to begin airing on 2 April.\n\nIt was intended that \"Cut\" begin broadcasting simultaneously on post-watershed television and during trailers for 15-rated films in cinemas from 2 April 2009. However, when the commercial was sent for approval by Clearcast, the advertising authority refused permission for \"Cut\" to appear on British television either before or after the watershed. Clearcast advised that the final scene of \"Cut\", in which Knightley's character is being kicked repeatedly by her boyfriend, was too violent and likely to cause offense, and therefore demanded that the scene be removed from the piece before it could be televised. Women's Aid refused to make the modifications, instead electing to eschew television and concentrate on the cinema, online, and print aspects of the campaign. \"Cut\" made its debut at cinemas on 6 April. Media space was donated by the cinema advertising companies Pearl & Dean, Digital Cinema Media, and Admedia. The ad also appeared online, both at a dedicated microsite and on video sharing website YouTube. This online component was backed up with a series of print advertisements created by Grey London creative director Nils Leonard.\n\nThe campaign was received well by the public. Within six days the film had over half a million hits online, swiftly rising to over a million. Of those who viewed \"Cut\", only two wrote to complain to the Advertising Standards Authority. Clearcast's decision to block the piece from appearing on television was widely lambasted. Reactions by the media to the ad itself were mixed. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown of \"The Independent\" supported the piece, saying: \"I know seeing her heroine Keira Knightley being knocked about by her lover will shake and wake my daughter up to this crime. Nothing I can say will have the same impact.\" However, Kira Cochrane of \"The Guardian\" was more critical, saying: \"[O]nce the initial horror had passed, I was left wondering about the point of the ad. [...] [T]here's something about a celebrity being used to represent a domestic violence victim that makes me feel slightly queasy.\" It was also featured as one of the top ten celebrity advertisements of 2009 in \"Campaign\" magazine. Irrespective of these differing opinions, \"Cut\" has proven to be a financial and critical success. During the period in which the campaign ran in cinemas and print, metrics reported a 33% increase in awareness of the charity, and Women's Aid received a 50% rise in people looking to make a donation. The campaign was also shortlisted for a Cyber Lion at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, considered one of the most prestigious awards in the advertising industry.\n\n"}

{"id": "1616185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1616185", "title": "Electronic lab notebook", "text": "Electronic lab notebook\n\nAn electronic lab notebook (also known as electronic laboratory notebook, or ELN) is a computer program designed to replace paper laboratory notebooks. Lab notebooks in general are used by scientists, engineers, and technicians to document research, experiments, and procedures performed in a laboratory. A lab notebook is often maintained to be a legal document and may be used in a court of law as evidence. Similar to an inventor's notebook, the lab notebook is also often referred to in patent prosecution and intellectual property litigation.\n\nElectronic lab notebooks are a fairly new technology and offer many benefits to the user as well as organizations. For example: electronic lab notebooks are easier to search upon, simplify data copying and backups, and support collaboration amongst many users. \nELNs can have fine-grained access controls, and can be more secure than their paper counterparts. They also allow the direct incorporation of data from instruments, replacing the practice of printing out data to be stapled into a paper notebook.\n\nELNs can be divided into two categories:\n\n\nSolutions range from specialized programs designed from the ground up for use as an ELN, to modifications or direct use of more general programs. Examples of using more general software include using OpenWetWare, a MediaWiki install (running the same software that Wikipedia uses), as an ELN, or the use of general note taking software such as OneNote as an ELN.\n\nELN's come in many different forms. They can be standalone programs, use a client-server model, or be entirely web-based. Some use a lab-notebook approach, others resemble a blog.\n\nA good many variations on the \"ELN\" acronym have appeared. Differences between systems with different names are often subtle, with considerable functional overlap between them. Examples include \"ERN\" (Electronic Research Notebook), \"ERMS\" (Electronic Resource (or Research or Records) Management System (or Software) and SDMS (Scientific Data (or Document) Management System (or Software). Ultimately, these types of systems all strive to do the same thing: Capture, record, centralize and protect scientific data in a way that is highly searchable, historically accurate, and legally stringent, and which also promotes secure collaboration, greater efficiency, reduced mistakes and lowered total research costs.\n\nA good electronic laboratory notebook should offer a secure environment to protect the integrity of both data and process, whilst also affording the flexibility to adopt new processes or changes to existing processes without recourse to further software development. The package architecture should be a modular design, so as to offer the benefit of minimizing validation costs of any subsequent changes that you may wish to make in the future as your needs change.\n\nA good electronic laboratory notebook should be an \"out of the box\" solution that, as standard, has fully configurable forms to comply with the requirements of regulated analytical groups through to a sophisticated ELN for inclusion of structures, spectra, chromatograms, pictures, text, etc. where a preconfigured form is less appropriate. All data within the system may be stored in a database (e.g. MySQL, MS-SQL, Oracle) and be fully searchable. The system should enable data to be collected, stored and retrieved through any combination of forms or ELN that best meets the requirements of the user.\n\nThe application should enable secure forms to be generated that accept laboratory data input via PCs and/or laptops / palmtops, and should be directly linked to electronic devices such as laboratory balances, pH meters, etc. Networked or wireless communications should be accommodated for by the package which will allow data to be interrogated, tabulated, checked, approved, stored and archived to comply with the latest regulatory guidance and legislation. A system should also include a scheduling option for routine procedures such as equipment qualification and study related timelines. It should include configurable qualification requirements to automatically verify that instruments have been cleaned and calibrated within a specified time period, that reagents have been quality-checked and have not expired, and that workers are trained and authorized to use the equipment and perform the procedures.\n\nThe laboratory accreditation criteria found in the ISO 17025 standard needs to be considered for the protection and computer backup of electronic records. These criteria can be found specifically in clause 4.13.1.4 of the standard.\n\nElectronic lab notebooks used for development or research in regulated industries, such as medical devices or pharmaceuticals, are expected to comply with FDA regulations related to software validation. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure the integrity of the entries in terms of time, authorship, and content. Unlike ELNs for patent protection, FDA is not concerned with patent interference proceedings, but is concerned with avoidance of falsification. Typical provisions related to software validation are included in the medical device regulations at 21 CFR 820 (et seq.) and Title 21 CFR Part 11. Essentially, the requirements are that the software has been designed and implemented to be suitable for its intended purposes. Evidence to show that this is the case is often provided by a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) setting forth the intended uses and the needs that the ELN will meet; one or more testing protocols that, when followed, demonstrate that the ELN meets the requirements of the specification and that the requirements are satisfied under worst-case conditions. Security, audit trails, prevention of unauthorized changes without substantial collusion of otherwise independent personnel (i.e., those having no interest in the content of the ELN such as independent quality unit personnel) and similar tests are fundamental. Finally, one or more reports demonstrating the results of the testing in accordance with the predefined protocols are required prior to release of the ELN software for use. If the reports show that the software failed to satisfy any of the SRS requirements, then corrective and preventive action (\"CAPA\") must be undertaken and documented. Such CAPA may extend to minor software revisions, or changes in architecture or major revisions. CAPA activities need to be documented as well.\n\nAside from the requirements to follow such steps for regulated industry, such an approach is generally a good practice in terms of development and release of any software to assure its quality and fitness for use. There are standards related to software development and testing that can be applied (see ref.).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3239136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3239136", "title": "French Popular Party", "text": "French Popular Party\n\nThe Parti Populaire Français (French Popular Party) was a French fascist and anti-semitic political party led by Jacques Doriot before and during World War II. It is generally regarded as the most collaborationist party of France.\n\nThe party was formed on 28 June 1936, by Doriot and a number of fellow former members of the French Communist Party (including Henri Barbé and Paul Marion) who had moved towards nationalism in opposition to the Popular Front. The PPF initially centered around the town of Saint-Denis, of which Doriot was mayor (as a Communist) from 1930–1934, and drew its support from the large working class population in the area. Although not avowedly nationalistic at this point, the PPF adopted many aspects of social nationalist politics, imagery and ideology, and quickly became popular among other nationalists, attracting to its ranks former members of such groups as Action Française, Jeunesses Patriotes, Croix de Feu and Solidarité Française. The party held a number of large rallies following their formation and adopted as the party flag a Celtic cross against a red, white and blue background. Members wore light blue shirts, dark blue trousers, berets and armbands bearing the party symbol as a uniform, although the uniform was not as ubiquitous as in other far right movements.\n\nDespite the Communist origins of much of its leadership (which retained the name Politburo), the party was virulently anti-Marxist, which it came to regard as a Jewish pseudo-socialism which was not working for real improvements to the situation of the French working-classes. Physical violence by PPF members (especially the PPF paramilitary wing, the \"Service d'Ordre\") against Communist Party supporters and other perceived enemies was not uncommon. The PPF, in its initial, working class, phase, was economically populist and anti-banking. It moved closer to corporatism in 1937 when Doriot was deserted by his traditional working class base in losing the mayoral election in Saint-Denis, and the party began receiving financial support from right-wing leaders of business and finance, such as the General Manager of the Banque Worms, Gabriel Leroy-Ladurie.\n\nDoriot proposed to Colonel François de La Rocque uniting his Parti Social Français with the PPF to form an anti-Marxist alliance to be called the \"Front de la Liberté\", but La Rocque, who was a capitalist, rejected the movement. That same year, the PPF contacted the Italian government of Benito Mussolini to request support. According to the private diary of Count Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's foreign minister and son-in-law): \"Doriot's right-hand-man has asked me to continue to pay subsidies and provide weapons. He envisages a winter filled with conflicts \"(Ciano diary, Sept. 1937). Ciano paid 300,000 francs from the coffers of Fascist Italy to Victor Arrighi (head of the Algiers section of the PPF).\n\nThese funds from the Italian Fascists and French banking and business interests were used to purchase a number of newspapers, including \"La Liberté\", which became the official party organ. After this, as its funding base shifted to big business, the PPF became increasingly pro-corporatist. In time, as the Nazi regime began to contribute a greater share of the PPF's funds, it began to advocate corporatism, and pushed for closer ties with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a grand alliance against the Soviet Union.\n\nThe PPF's ardent advocacy of collaboration with the Nazis was accompanied, somewhat discordantly, with nationalistic rhetoric. Members of the PPF were required to take the following oath:\n\n\"In the name of the people and of the fatherland, I swear fidelity and devotion to the Parti Populaire Français, its ideals, and its leader. I swear to serve until the supreme sacrifice the cause of national and popular revolution which will leave a new, free and independent France.\" \nThe PPF is generally regarded to be a fascist party in its ideological, as well as its practical, orientation. The party denounced parliamentarianism and sought to limit French democracy and remake French society according to its own, authoritarian beliefs. It was vehemently opposed to both Marxism and liberalism and also wished to rid France of Freemasonry, about which it was greatly concerned. The PPF were critical of the supremacy of rationalism in politics and desired a move towards politics dictated by emotion and will rather than reason. Intellectuals who are often viewed as fascists, notably Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, Ramón Fernandez, Alexis Carrel, Paul Chack, and Bertrand de Jouvenel, were members of the PPF at various times. Moreover, the PPF was anti-semitic. They had initially been ambiguous towards anti-Semitism, expressing a negative view of Jews in their literature (associating Jews with banking interests) but allowing a Jew, Alexandre Abremski, to sit on their Politburo until his death in 1938. In 1936, Doriot stated: \"Our party [the PPF] is not anti-Semitic. It is a great national party that has better things to do than fight Jews.\" By 1938, PPF literature was filled with references to the \"Judeo-masonic-bolshevik\" conspiracy. As the PPF tended more towards fascism, and especially after the French defeat and the establishment of Vichy France, anti-Semitism became much more a central feature of party policy. In 1941, Doriot, writing in the journal \"Au Pilori\", would write: (t)he Jew is not a man. He's a stinking beast.\" This overt anti-semitic ideology was manifested by the paramilitary \"Gardes Françaises\" (formerly the \"Service d'Ordre\"), in which many PPF members operated and which participated in wide-scale violence against Jews in France and North Africa and in the mass-deportation of Jews to concentration camps.[NTD: cite needed]\n\nAfter the France's defeat in the Battle of France and the establishment of the regime of Philippe Pétain at Vichy, the PPF received additional support from Germany and increased its activities. The U.S. State Department placed it on a list of organizations under the direct control of the Nazi regime. As a fascist party, the PPF was critical of the neotraditional authoritarian state established by Petain, criticizing the regime for being too moderate, and advocating closer military collaboration with Germany (such as sending troops to the Russian front), and modeling French government, and its racial policies, directly on those of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe PPF increasingly placed anti-Semitism at its core as it collaborated with units of the Gestapo and the Milice, the French paramilitary organization led by Joseph Darnand, in violently rounding up Jews for deportation to concentration camps. The PPF paramilitaries participated in beatings, torture, assassinations and summary execution of Jews and political enemies of the Nazis. For this, the Germans rewarded them by allowing them the right to steal property from the Jews they arrested.\n\nAfter Pierre Laval ascended of to leadership of the government on April 18, 1942, he requested that Nazi Germany allow him to force the PPF to merge into his own supporters, but the Nazis denied that request. However, as Laval moved France closer to the Nazi regime, the PPF ceased to be as useful to the Nazis as advocates of greater collaboration. As a result, the PPF was politically marginalized and their role as critics of the regime was diminished, although it did not cease entirely. By the end of the war, the PPF had virtually ceased to function as a political party, the attention of its leader and many of its members turning more directly to participation in the Nazi war effort.\n\nThe PPF and the collaborationist Rassemblement national populaire (RNP) also established the \"Comité ouvrier de secours immédiat\" in March 1942. This organisation sought to aid victims of the Allied bombing of France and, following the Normandy landings, aided refugees fleeing the fighting.\n\nOther groups linked to the PPF by common membership had less humanitarian motives: in Lyon a \"Mouvement national anti-terroriste\" was established to combat the Resistance by fighting \"terror with terror\"; other PPF members joined the \"Gardes Française\" set up by German police authorities as a counterweight to the Milice, which was deemed too French, or the \"Groupes d'action pour la justice sociale\" which hunted down French youth who went into hiding rather than do the mandatory labour work under the STO programme. These groups often operated beyond the control of the party.\n\nDebate exists as to whether PPF members actually fought against the Allies in Normandy. Doriot's biographers differ on the subject: Jean-Paul Brunet argues that the PPF did fight against the Allied invasion while Dieter Wolf denies any such action occurred. However, Doriot, in German uniform, and Beugras, the clandestine PPF intelligence chief, visited the Normandy front in July 1944. PPF recruits were trained in espionage and sabotage and some were shot after being captured by the Allies while attempting to infiltrate Allied lines in Northern France.\n\nIn 1941, Doriot urged PPF members to join the newly formed Légion des Volontaires Français (LVF) to fight on the eastern front. The unit's performance was poor and the following year it was removed to anti-partisan actions in Belarus. In 1944 the LVF, along with a separate unit, the Waffen-SS Französische SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Regiment (Waffen-SS French SS-Volunteer Grenadier Regiment), and French collaborators fleeing the Allied advance in the west were amalgamated into the Waffen-Grenadier-Brigade der SS \"Charlemagne\". In February 1945 the unit was officially upgraded to a division and renamed 33.Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS \"Charlemagne\". Doriot himself saw action and served three tours of duty on the Eastern Front between 1941 and 1944. In his absence, leadership of the PPF officially passed to a directorate. However effective leadership rested with Maurice-Yvan Sicard who resisted attempts to merge the party into a wider movement.\n\nThe PPF attempted to aid German intelligence efforts and/or conduct sabotage activities in French territories occupied by the Allies. On January 8, 1943 a group of PPF militants originally from Maghreb, Germans and sympathetic Tunisians were parachuted into Southern Tunisia to conduct sabotage - but were arrested almost immediately. From 1943 to 1944, PPF and collaborationist agents were parachuted into North Africa, where, under codename Atlas, they were to transmit information on Allied military preparations and the local political situation to PPF agents in France, who in turn, were to pass this information to German intelligence. These intelligence activities occurred under the aegis of Albert Beugras, head of the PPF's clandestine \"Service de renseignment\", and whose activities were unknown even to the political cadres of the Party. Not only did Atlas fail to transmit the desired political information, but the head of the network, Edmond Lantham, a professional soldier and former member of Vichy's , went over to the Free French and ensured that Atlas broadcast misinformation to the PPF and German intelligence. Atlas broadcast that the Allies intended to invade Sardinia or Greece rather than Sicily in 1943, therefore reinforcing British intelligence's famous Operation Mincemeat, and spread misinformation that disguised the Allied invasion plans of Italy and Provence. Atlas continued transmitting misinformation from Allied occupied Marseilles and Paris in 1944. Doriot and Beugras did not discover the 'treason' until 1945.\n\nIn 1944, Doriot moved to Germany where he competed for the leadership of the French government-in-exile with the members of the former Vichy regime based in the Sigmaringen enclave. The PPF based itself in Mainau, set up its own radio station, \"Radio-Patrie\", at Bad Mergentheim and published its own paper \"Le Petit Parisien\". The PPF was also involved in setting up training centres for French recruits to train operatives in conducting intelligence and sabotage activities, some of whom the Germans dropped by parachute into Allied occupied France.\n\nOn February 22, 1945, Doriot, attired in his SS uniform and being driven in a Nazi officer's car, was killed by Allied strafers near Mengen, Württemberg, Germany, while en route from Mainau to Sigmaringen. The PPF movement did not survive the death of its leader, and no attempt was made to revive it in postwar France.\n\n\"See .\"\n\n\n"}

It is located on the fourth floor of the John Cotton Dana Library at Rutgers University-Newark in Newark, New Jersey. The archival collection contains more than 100,000 sound recordings on CDs, LPs, EPs, 78- and 75-rpm disks, and 6,000 books. It also houses over 30 instruments used by famous jazz musicians.\n\nIn 2013, the Institute was designated a Literary Landmark by New Jersey's Center for the Book in the National Registry of the Library of Congress. It is the fifth place in New Jersey to be given this designation, after the Newark Public Library, Paterson Public Library, the Walt Whitman House and the Joyce Kilmer Tree, which is located at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.\n\nMajor collections housed in the Institute include the Jazz Oral History Project, the Mary Lou Williams collection, the Women In Jazz collection, the Benny Carter Audio collection, and the Benny Goodman Audio collection.\n\nIn 1952, the Institute of Jazz Studies was founded by Marshall Stearns, a jazz scholar, literature professor, and author. Stearns had a plan for a jazz institute as early as 1949, which he thought to call the \"Institute of Modern American Music\". It was originally located at his apartment at 108 Waverly Place in New York City. Marshall Stearns described the Institute of Jazz Studies' mission in 1953 as the following:\n\nStearns negotiated transfer of IJS to Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey in 1966. He died before the final transfer took place. In 1967 the Institute materials were moved to the Newark campus of Rutgers University in New Jersey. Charles Nanry, a sociologist, worked part-time as its administrator. It was first located in the Dana Library (1972), then moved to Bradley Hall (1975).\n\nThe Institute was formally affiliated with the John Cotton Dana Library at Rutgers – Newark in 1984. The current expanded facilities in the library opened in 1994. Over its 60 years of existence, the Institute has acquired significant collections of periodicals as well as books, records, and archival materials from several musicians, photographers, and journalists. Major collections include the personal papers of Mary Lou Williams, Victoria Spivey, Abbey Lincoln, Annie Ross, Benny Carter, and James P. Johnson.\n\nA special column in \"The Record Changer\" jazz magazine was the initial, temporary place of publication for the Institute of Jazz Studies scholarship.\n\nThe \"Journal of Jazz Studies\" (JJS) was published from 1973 to 1979. \"Annual Review of Jazz Studies\" (ARJS) publication began in 1981 as a continuation of JJS. Today, the \"Journal of Jazz Studies\" is an open-access online journal. The online journal continues and expands upon the tradition of the original JJS/ARJS as the longest running English-language scholarly jazz journal. It is open-access and peer-reviewed.\n\n\"Studies in Jazz\", a monograph series with Scarecrow Press, publishes books related to jazz.\n\nIn addition to its publications, the Institute also hosts \"Jazz From The Archives\", a radio show on WBGO radio that airs every Sunday and a Jazz Research Roundtable.\n\nSince 2012, the Institute has also hosted an annual Jazz Archives Fellowship. The fellowship is open to graduate students of library science or recent graduates with an interest in jazz or African American studies. It is supported by the Morroe Berger - Benny Carter Jazz Research Fund, an endowment established by musician Benny Carter in 1987 to provide grants to facilitate jazz research by students and scholars. The Fellowship Program is also funded by private funds.\n\nIn 2014, the fellows focused on the collection of Ismay Duvivier, a dancer, and her son George Duvivier, a bass player.\n\nIn 1987, the Institute began funding up to ten grants of $1,000 each year. The fund was started by musician Benny Carter in memory of Morroe Berger. Berger was a professor of sociology at Princeton University until his death in 1981. Half of the awards are designated for students in the Rutgers-Newark Master's Program in Jazz History and Research and half are awarded to scholars from other institutions. The awards are for visiting the Institute and performing independent jazz-related research. To date, over 70 awards have been granted.\n\n\n\n"}

At America's union peak in the 1950s, union membership was lower in the United States than in most comparable countries. By 1989, that figure had dropped to about 16%, the lowest percentage of any developed democracy, except France. Union membership for other developed democracies, in 1986/87 were:\n\n\nIn 1987, United States unionization was 37 points below the average of seventeen countries surveyed, down from 17 points below average in 1970. Between 1970 and 1987, union membership declined in only three other countries: Austria, by 3%,\nJapan, by 7%, and the Netherlands, by 4%. In the United States, union membership had declined by 14%.\n\nIn 2008, 12.4% of U.S. wage and salary workers were union members. 36.8% of public sector workers were union members, but only 7.6% of workers in private sector industries were. The most unionized sectors of the economy have had the greatest decline in union membership. From 1953 to the late 1980s membership in construction fell from 84% to 22%, manufacturing from 42% to 25%, mining from 65% to 15%, and transportation from 80% to 37%.\n\nFrom 1971 to the late 1980s, there was a 10% drop in union membership in the U.S. public sector and a 42% drop in union membership in the U.S. private sector. For comparison, there was no drop in union membership in the private sector in Sweden. In other countries drops included:\n\n\nThe General Confederation of Labour (\"CGT\") is a national trade union center, the first of the five major French confederations of trade unions. Until the 1990s it was closely linked to the French Communist Party (PCF).\n\nIt is the largest in terms of votes (32.1% at the 2002 professional election, 34.0% in the 2008 election), and second largest in terms of membership numbers.\n\nIts membership decreased to 650,000 members in 1995–96 (it had more than doubled when Socialist François Mitterrand was elected President in 1981), before increasing today to between 700,000 and 720,000 members, slightly fewer than the Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail (CFDT).\n\nAccording to the historian M. Dreyfus, the direction of the CGT is slowly evolving, since the 1990s, during which it cut all organic links with the Communist Party, in favour of a more moderate stance. The CGT is concentrating its attention, in particular since the 1995 general strikes, to trade-unionism in the private sector.\n\nThe \"French Democratic Confederation of Labour\", \"CFDT\" is one of the five major confederations. It is the largest French trade union confederation by number of members (875,000) but comes only second after the Confédération générale du travail (CGT) in voting results for representative bodies.\n\nThe CFDT was created in 1964 when a majority of the members of the Christian trade union Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens (CFTC) decided to become secular. The minority kept the name CFTC.\n\nLabour unions emerged in Japan in the second half of the Meiji period, after 1890, as the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization. Until 1945, however, the labour movement remained weak, impeded by lack of legal rights, anti-union legislation, management-organized factory councils, and political divisions between “cooperative” and radical unionists. In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the US Occupation authorities initially encouraged the formation of independent unions. Legislation was passed that enshrined the right to organize, and membership rapidly rose to 5 million by February 1947. The organization rate peaked at 55.8% of all workers in 1949 and subsequently declined to 18.5% as of 2010.\n\nThe labour movement went through a process of reorganization from 1987 to 1991 from which emerged the present configuration of three major labour union federations, along with other smaller national union organizations.\n\nThe unionization rate in the U.S. and Canada followed fairly similar paths from 1920 to the mid-1960s; both peaked at about 30%. However the U.S. rate declined steadily after 1974 to 12% in 2011. Meanwhile, the Canadian rate dropped from 37% the mid-1980s to 30% in 2010. Part of the reason is the different mixture of industry, and part is due to more favourable Canadian laws.\n\nIn 1937 there were 4,740 strikes in the United States. This was the greatest strike wave in American labor history. The number of major strikes and lockouts in the U.S. fell by 97% from 381 in 1970 to 187 in 1980 to only 11 in 2010. Companies countered the threat of a strike by threatening to close or move a plant.\n\nLabor unions first developed in Costa Rica in the late 1880s. The first unions were organized with the help of the Catholic Church. By 1913, the first International Workers Day was celebrated and unions, supported in particular by the Popular Vanguard Party, pushed for Alfredo González Flores' tax reforms. Unions grew in number and coverage. A major historical event for Costa Rican labor was the 1934 United Fruit Company, a national strike involving more than 30 unions which ended with many labor leaders imprisoned. Head of state Teodoro Picado Michalski violently repressed union leaders, leading to the tensions that created the 1948 Costa Rican Civil War. Labor unions continued to grow, supported by the Catholic church, and the first collective bargaining agreement was reached in 1967. Óscar Arias fought fiercely to dissolve and reduce the power of private sector unions in the 1980s. Arias' austerity measures\nled to a period of increased labor activity as poverty and unemployment increased. Despite the resurgence, unions, particularly in the private sector, still faced opposition and repression. During the 2007 Central American Free Trade Agreement referendum, labor unions unsuccessfully organized to encourage its rejection.\n\nLabor unions are active in both the public and private sectors. Major concerns include salaries increased to reflect inflation, regulation of public commodities, and a stronger Caja Costarricense del Seguro Social (Costa Rican Social Security Department). Many labor unions are also asking for increased environmental regulation, and increased oversight of cooperative banks. One important issue for Costa Rica unions is passage a new labor law. Former president Laura Chinchilla vetoed it, but Solís appears to want the issue passed, as do many members of the Legislative Assembly.\n\nEconomists have explored the linkage between unionization and levels of overall GDP growth and unemployment, especially in light of the high unemployment in Europe since the 1980s and the stagnation in growth rates. On both the theoretical and the empirical sides, experts have not reached any consensus.\n\nBetween 1877 and 1968, 700 people have been killed in American labor disputes. In the 1890s, roughly two American workers were killed and 140 injured for every 100,000 strikers. In France, three French workers were injured for every 100,000 strikers. In the 1890s, only 70 French strikers were arrested per 100,000. For the United States, national arrest rates are simply impossible to compile. In Illinois, the arrest rate for the latter half of the 1890s decade was at least 700 per 100,000 strikers, or ten times that of France; in New York for that decade it was at least 400.\n\nBetween 1902 and 1904 in America , at least 198 people were killed, 1,966 workers were injured. One worker was killed and 1,009 were injured for every 100,000 strikers. Between 1877 and 1968, American state and federal troops intervened in labor disputes more than 160 times, almost invariably on behalf of employers. Business was disrupted, usually by strikes, on 22,793 occasions between 1875 and 1900.\n\nOther examples of the violence both by and against U.S. union members in the late 19th and early 20th centuries include the Centralia Massacre, the Great Railroad Strike of 1922, and the Copper Country Strike of 1913-1914\n\n\n\n"}

Reveal\n\nJames Lauritz Reveal (March 29, 1941 – January 9, 2015) was a U.S. botanist best known for his contributions to the genus \"Eriogonum\" and for his work on suprageneric names. His website, at PlantSystematics.org, also presents material on plant taxonomy including the Reveal system. He published extensively on North American flora, was a member of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, and was one of the authors of the APG II and APG III classifications.\n\nAt the time of his death, Reveal was a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland, adjunct professor at Cornell University's Department of Plant Biology and honorary curator at the New York Botanical Garden.\n\nJames Lauritz Reveal was born on March 29, 1941, in Reno, Nevada to Arlene Hadfield Reveal and Jack Lilburn Reveal (1912-1988), a librarian and a forester/botanist, respectively. Reveal attended Utah State University (B.S. 1964, M.S. 1966) and received his Ph.D. from Brigham Young University in 1969. He held a post-doctoral fellowship with the Smithsonian Institution from 1967 to 1969.\n\nIn 1969, Reveal joined the Botany faculty at the University of Maryland, serving as director of the Norton-Brown Herbarium of the University of Maryland between 1979 and 1999. During his tenure, the Norton-Brown Herbarium amassed one of the greatest collections of Polygonaceae subfam. Eriogonoideae in the world.\n\nReveal's research interests included botanical studies in the American West, especially endangered and threatened species. He studied the history of botanical exploration in the New World and botanical nomenclature and taxonomy as well, with much of his research and writing devoted to the Polygonaceae subfamily Eriogonoideae, commonly known as the wild buckwheats. His interest in combining history and botany led to projects on botanical history of colonial Maryland and on the botanical discoveries of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, about which he wrote several books and articles. A prolific collector, author, and speaker, Reveal collected more than 9,000 plant specimens from North America, Central America, and China, and published over 500 papers; he presented more than 100 invited talks.\n\nAs a member of the Smithsonian Institution's Endangered Species Committee (1974-1982), Reveal was instrumental in attaining the addition of endangered plant species to the original Endangered Species Act.\n\nReveal discovered or identified over fifty plant varieties, most of these discoveries being flowering plants of the American Southwest. In 1968, Reveal identified five new plant varieties at a Nevada nuclear testing site. In 1981, Reveal and Norlyn James Bodkin, then professor of Botany at James Madison University, identified a new lily variety, the first new plant discovery along the eastern U.S. seaboard since the 1940s. They named the new variety of Virginia Wake Robin \"Trillium pusillum var. monticulum\" (Shenandoah Wake Robin).\n\nIn 1978, Reveal married his University of Maryland colleague, the botanist C. Rose Broome (later with the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture). They collaborated on many research projects, most notably the botanical studies of colonial Maryland and explorations in Mexico that identified two new plant varieties. Reveal helped document the flora of Maryland and the Mid-Atlantic and assisted in Broome's 1979 publication of the first checklist of \"Rare and Endangered Vascular Plant Species in Maryland.\"\n\nIn 1992, Reveal's illustrated \"'Gentle Conquest: The Botanical Discovery of North America\" was published. \"Gentle Conquest\" encompasses the history of botanical exploration in the New World from the first settlement to the end of the Western frontier.\n\nReveal retired from the Botany Department at the University of Maryland in 1999, but remained active, holding emeritus appointments including Honorary Curator of the New York Botanical Garden (2003-2015) and Adjunct Professor at Cornell University (2007-2015), working on the Intermountain Flora project and collecting plant specimens throughout several Western U.S. states, including California, Colorado, and Nevada. He made numerous contributions to the website, Discovering Lewis & Clark.\n\nIn 2009, Reveal received the North American Rock Garden Society's Edgar T. Wherry award for his contributions to the genus \"Eriogonum\". Reveal died on January 9, 2015 in Ithaca, New York.\n\nReveal made major contributions to the systematic taxonomy of the flowering plants. in 1997 he published his own system of classification online in ten parts as lecture notes comparing the major systems in use at that time, but without accompanying rationale.\n\nFollowing this Reveal became an author with the consensus Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) on the APG II 2003 and APG III 2009 processes. Although this largely supplanted the earlier and competing systems, he collaborated with Robert Thorne on his system (2007), and subsequently continued to develop his own system.\n\nReveal made major contributions to the systematics of Polygonaceae subfamily Eriogonoideae, and other families. For his many contributions to botany, seven species and one genus have been named in his honor (patronyms).\n\n\n\"See C.V.\"\n\n\n\n"}

In the evaluation of Michael Carson and Michael Loewe, \nThe \"Lü shih ch'un ch'iu\" is unique among early works in that it is well organized and comprehensive, containing extensive passages on such subjects as music and agriculture, which are unknown elsewhere. It is also one of the longest of the early texts, extending to something over 100,000 words. (1993:324) \n\nThe \"Shiji\" (chap. 85, p. 2510) biography of Lü Buwei has the earliest information about the \"Lüshi Chunqiu\". Lü was a successful merchant from Handan who befriended King Zhuangxiang of Qin. The king's son Zheng (政, who the \"Shiji\" suggests was actually Lü's son) eventually became the first emperor Qin Shi Huang in 221 BC. When Zhuangxiang died in 247 BC, Lü Buwei was made regent for the 13-year-old Zheng. In order to establish Qin as the intellectual center of China, Lü \"recruited scholars, treating them generously so that his retainers came to number three thousand\" (tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:13). In 239 BC, he, in the words of the \"Shiji\"\n\nAccording to \"Shiji\", Lü exhibited the completed encyclopedic text at the city gate of Xianyang, capital of Qin, and above it was a notice offering a thousand measures of gold to any traveling scholar who could add or subtract even a single word.\n\nThe \"Hanshu Yiwenzhi\" lists the \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" as belonging to the \"Zajia\" (雜家/杂家 \"Mixed School\"), within the Philosophers' domain (諸子略), or Hundred Schools of Thought. Although this text is frequently characterized as \"syncretic,\" \"eclectic\", or \"miscellaneous\", it was a cohesive summary of contemporary philosophical thought, including Legalism, Confucianism, Mohism, and Daoism.\n\nThe title uses \"chunqiu\" (春秋 lit. \"spring and autumn\") meaning \"annals; chronicle\" in a classical reference to the Confucianist \"chunqiu\" \"Spring and Autumn Annals\", which chronicles the State of Lu history from 772–481 BC.\n\nThe \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" text comprises 26 \"juan\" (巻 \"scrolls; books\") in 160 \"pian\" (篇 \"sections\"), and is divided into three major parts; the \"Ji\" (紀, \"The Almanacs\"): Books 1-12 correspond to the months of the year, and list appropriate seasonal activities to ensure that the state runs smoothly. This part, which was copied as the \"Liji\" chapter \"Yueling\", takes many passages from other texts, often without attribution. The \"Lan\" (覧, \"The Examinations\"): Books 13–20 each have 8 sections corresponding to the 64 Hexagrams in the \"Yijing\". This is the longest and most eclectic part, giving quotations from many early texts, some no longer extant. The \"Lun\" (論, \"The Discourses\"): Books 21–26 mostly deal with rulership, excepting the final four sections about agriculture. This part resembles the \"Lan\" in composition.\n\nComposition features, measure of completeness (i.e. veracity of the \"Shi ji\" account) and/or possible corruption of the original Annals have been subjects of scholarly attention. It has been mentioned that the Almanacs have much higher measure of integrity and thematic organization than the other two parts of the text.\n\nThe \"Yu da\" 諭大 chapter of the Examinations, for example, contains text almost identical to the \"Wu da\" 務大 chapter of the Discourses, though in the first case it is ascribed to \"Jizi\" 季子, and in the second to Confucius.\n\nLiang Qichao (1873-1929): \"This book, through the course of two thousand years, has had no deletions nor corruptions. Moreover, it has the excellent commentary of Gao You. Truly it is the most perfect and easily read work among the ancient books.\"\n\nLiang's position, mildly criticized afterwards, was dictated by the lack of canonical status ascribed to the book.\n\nAdmitting the difficulties of summarizing the \"Lüshi Chunqiu\", John Knoblock and Jeffrey Riegel list 18 major points.\nThe \"Lüshi chunqiu\" is an invaluable compendium of early Chinese thought and civilization.\n\n\n"}

MODS was designed as a compromise between the complexity of the MARC format used by libraries and the extreme simplicity of Dublin Core metadata.\n\nThe Library of Congress' Network Development and MARC Standards Office, with interested experts, developed the Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) in 2002 for a bibliographic element set that may be used for a variety of purposes, and particularly for library applications. As an XML schema it is intended to be able to carry selected data from existing MARC 21 records as well as to enable the creation of original resource description records. It includes a subset of MARC fields and uses language-based tags rather than numeric ones, in some cases regrouping elements from the MARC 21 bibliographic format. MODS was first announced for trial use in June 2002. As of May 5, 2015 it is at version 3.7.\n\nThe number of users of MODS is unknown. Implementers are encouraged to register their uses of MODS in the implementation registry on the official MODS website. To date there are about 35 projects listed in the registry, although it is assumed that many others are making use of the standard. Users are primarily operating in the area of digital libraries, and some of the registered uses are in digital library projects at the Library of Congress.\n\nThe MODS record has been designed to carry key data elements from the MARC record but does not define all of the MARC fields and does not use the field and subfield tagging from the MARC standard. There are data elements in MODS that are not compatible with the MARC record so there is some loss translating from MARC to MODS and from MODS to MARC. There is no commitment on the part of the Library of Congress to maintain compatibility between the two metadata formats beyond what is convenient to the community of MODS users.\n\nThe use of MODS provides several advantages compared to other metadata schemas:\n\n\nRevisions to the schema are suggested and discussed on the MODS listserv, and approved by the MODS Editorial Committee. The MODS/MADS Editorial Committee is an international group of volunteers responsible for maintaining editorial control over MODS and MADS and their accompanying documentation as well as for the MODS and MADS XML schemas. The Library of Congress carries out the application of approved changes to the schema and maintains the official web site for the standard. There is no formal standards body involved in the MODS schema at this time.\n\n"}

Its beautiful apartments, pavilions, gates and gardens feature \"some of the most elegant spaces at a time widely considered to be the pinnacle of Chinese interior design.\" Throughout the Qing dynasty, the palace was almost never used, largely because of the Qianlong Emperor's imperial decree ordering his retirement retreat remain unaltered.\n\nIn 1778, after a candidate at the imperial examination questioned the Qianlong Emperor publicly about naming a successor during an official tour in the north, the emperor, then 67 years old, announced in a court letter that \"if fate would allow him to live so long, he would abdicate the throne at the age of 85 by Chinese reckoning, which would be in 1796.\" He \"reassured the Chinese people that he had secretly chosen his heir, and that the choice was safely written down.\" His decision to \"withdraw into leisure\" was made to avoid breaking the record of his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor, as the longest ruling emperor of China (61 years, 318 days), an important act of filial piety for the conservative Qianlong Emperor.\n\nAlthough he pledged to retire, and took the title of Retired Emperor after officially yielding the throne to his son (the Jiaqing Emperor) after 60 years, 124 days of rule, the Qianlong Emperor never spent a night in his Palace of Tranquil Longevity, and continued to hold on to power. The Jiaqing Emperor reigned only nominally until his father's death on 7 February 1799, making the Qianlong Emperor's actual reign 63 years and 122 days long.\n\nThat an imperial retirement retreat was built at all is a testament to the significance the Qianlong Emperor placed on honoring his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor, and by extension how paramount public deference to Confucian thought and filial obligations was to the Qianlong Emperor, quite unlike the previous Manchu (non-Han) rulers that preceded him. This retirement palace was built as an important cultural and political statement, and as gesture of solidarity with Chinese social mores amid enduring anti-Qing sentiment. The details within the lavish, two-acre walled retreat further affirm the Qianlong Emperor's love and affinity for Chinese culture, and are indicative of his decorative, architectural, and landscaping tastes, as well as his intentions and goals for China.\n\nDespite the Qianlong Emperor never having moved into his retirement suites, they were not damaged by other inhabitants or looters in the intervening centuries; \"the garden has remained virtually unchanged since its initial construction, thanks in no small measure to the emperor's decree that the site not be altered by future generations, the eighteenth-century equivalent of a landmarks preservation law.\"\n\nThe Qianlong Garden is currently undergoing restoration in a new partnership between the Palace Museum in Beijing and the New York-based World Monuments Fund. To tackle the myriad challenges of such a unique restoration, including assessing the Qianlong Emperor's idiosyncratic mixture of Han, Manchu, and European materials and techniques and battling centuries of dust and decay, the project brought together the (American) WMF's \"well-practiced conservation techniques\" and Chinese experts' \"deep understanding of the Qianlong Emperor's architectural tastes and decorative predilections. The supporting cast includes aging artisans whose rarefied skills somehow survived the Cultural Revolution, when traditional craftsmanship was considered bourgeois and worthy of punishment.\" The partnership's \"slavishly faithful restoration\" of the first suite completed, the Juanqinzhai, is \"somewhat of a milestone\" in China, where, according to \"The New York Times\", \"historic preservation usually entails razing a structure and replacing it with a brightly painted replica.\"\n\nBeijing's \"China Daily\" lauded the achievements of the Juanqinzhai, and reported that \"The results have been so successful that the WMF, a private, non-profit New York-based preservation group, has extended its alliance with Chinese cultural officials to restore the Qianlong Garden's 26 other buildings and four courtyards.\" The Chinese have contributed an additional $5 million to extend the project. The entire $18 million, long-term restoration of the Qianlong Garden was initially slated to end in 2017, but now is expected to finish in 2019, in time for the Forbidden City's 600th anniversary in 2020.\n\nInside the decorative walls are 27 structures, though the WMF lists 24 sites on its restoration map, including apartments, pavilions, gates and more.\n\nAs restoration continues, more of the buildings of the Qianlong Garden are expected to be opened to the public for study and tours. As of 2012, few have studied the apartments of the Qianlong Emperor's retreat, aside from the \"Juanqinzhai\" in the Palace's fourth courtyard, where restoration began in 2007.\n\nThe first of the Qianlong Garden apartments to be restored, the emperor's \"Juanqinzhai\", \"retirement lodge\" or literally, \"Studio of Exhaustion From Diligent Service,\" was completed in 2010 after a $3 million effort by Beijing's Palace Museum and the American-sponsored World Monuments Fund (WMF). The Juanqinzhai, accompanied by about 100 exquisite Qianlong era artifacts, \"sumptuous murals, furniture, architectural elements, Buddhist icons, and decorative arts—almost all of which have never before been seen publicly,\" began a tour of the United States in fall 2010. The 1.5-million-yuan ($220,807) exhibition was first organized and debuted at the Peabody Essex Museum, in Salem, Massachusetts, then in 2011 had stints at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and finally, at the Milwaukee Art Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nThe Juanqinzhai is now regarded as one of the only surviving examples of 18th-century Chinese interior design: \"only the successive residential palaces of the Qianlong Emperor in the Forbidden City can make any claim to preserve many components of an original secular interior of the pre-1840 period.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "4506261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4506261", "title": "Public Information Network for Electronic Services", "text": "Public Information Network for Electronic Services\n\nThe Public Information Network for Electronic Services (or PINES) is the nearly statewide library consortium and its online library catalog of the Georgia Public Library Service. By June 2017, the catalog consisted of books from 284 library facilities in 143 counties across the U.S. state of Georgia with a collection size of 10.6 million items, all of which are searchable by anyone with a PINES library card which can be obtained free of charge from any PINES-participating library.\n\nThe PINES system effectively turns most of the state of Georgia into one huge library. PINES cardholders are able to request an interlibrary loan from any affiliated library, and the single statewide library card grants access to the hundreds of branches associated with the service. PINES also manages the booking of rooms, the use of remote self-check machines, allows automated search and retrieval, as well as supports RSS and Schema.org standards.\n\nPINES developed the open-source software Evergreen, an integrated library system which it and other library consortia use to manage their online catalogs.\n\nIn 1998 a white paper was created exploring the feasibility of a statewide public library card for Georgia. As Georgia had consistently ranked among the lowest states in public library funding per capita it was agreed that a universal library card could be of great benefit to the residents of Georgia as long as the affiliated libraries were unified under one single integrated library system (ILS). It was also believed that by establishing a state-wide library cost to individual library systems would be lowered as they wouldn't need to maintain their own integrated library systems, and certain tasks could be centralized through the state saving additional time.\n\nBy 1999 PINES became a reality, administered by the current Georgia Public Library Service (GPLS). It initially was used as a Y2K state-funded project to address needs of public libraries without Y2K-compliant ILS computer services. These libraries, mostly rural, were deemed not to have programs that would survive into the 21st century. Some libraries were still not automated as well. The PINES initiative would give these libraries access first, bringing their services into the modern era. Looking to complete the project before the year 2000, on April 8, 1999 the initial contract to develop the ILS was awarded to KPMG Consulting Inc partnered with the SIRSI Corporation and Sun Microsystems.\n\nIn December of 1999 the new software was finished and ready for deployment. In that same month Phase 1 of PINES went live with 98 affiliated libraries. For the next two years other libraries saw the success of PINES, and rather than replace their outdated ILS with a new independent one, requested to join the statewide system. In 2001 Phase 2 of PINES went live with an addition 111 libraries joining the service.\n\nIn 2004 the GPLS decided not to renew their contract with KPMG/Sirsi after being advised that under the current software no more libraries would be able to be added to the system. As a result the GPLS explored the possibility of creating their own software, and on June 4, 2004 a press release by the state librarian outlined a two-year development plan for a new PINES ILS software called Evergreen.\n\nThe new ILS was completed and ready to go live in September of 2006. On September 1, the Sirsi ILS was taken offline, and by September 5 Evergreen was up and running. Due to the success of Evergreen it was awarded the Mellon Award for Technology Collaboration in 2007 by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nSince its initial release, Evergreen is now used in over 1,800 libraries around the world, including the highest-circulating library in the United States, the King County Library System.\n\nThere are several library systems in Georgia outside of the PINES system. Most of those are in the Atlanta metropolitan area, but the library systems of the Columbus metropolitan area are also outside of the PINES system. In February 2018, the Live Oak Public Libraries of the Savannah metropolitan area joined the PINES consortium.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2652899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2652899", "title": "Silverpilen", "text": "Silverpilen\n\nThe Silver Arrow (Swedish: \"Silverpilen\") is the nickname of a Stockholm Metro train which features in several urban legends alleging sightings of the train's \"ghost\".\n\nThe train is usually referred to as being composed of silver aluminum model C5 cars. Only one such train, composed of eight cars, was built; it was manufactured in the mid-1960s as a test unit. In a fleet of hundreds of green metro trains, Silverpilen was the only one of the trains that had not been painted and therefore remained silver. Apart from its color, air suspension, a whining distinctive motor sound and the \"outlying\" sliding doors (hence the increased passenger capacity), it was almost identical to the other metro trains in service during its lifespan.\n\nStarting from the point at which it was taken into production in the mid-1960s, up until 1996, Silverpilen was sometimes used as a backup train; particularly during rush hour. The train was used as backup on all the existing Stockholm underground lines, although more commonly on the Red and Green lines. Before and after its passenger operation it used to run without passengers to the depot without stopping, something some people found odd.\n\nThe interior of the cars were devoid of the usual advertisements and the pale green walls bore signs of partly removed graffiti. This scruffy look contributed to the reputation of Silverpilen as \"different\".\n\nThe train was used in the 1993 film \"Sökarna\" (\"The Seekers\") a film which took place in Stockholm. In the film, Neo-Nazi supporters can be seen abusing immigrants on Silverpilen as it approaches Kungsträdgården metro station. Two people are later killed as they get pushed onto the track by the neo-Nazis and subsequently run over by the train, whose driver is powerless to stop in time.\n\nThe silver train was only rarely seen by the average Stockholm dweller.\n\nThe background for the ghost stories associated with Silverpilen may be related to the eerie look of Silverpilen if seen arriving late at night to an open-air underground station. People were used to green metro trains and were surprised at the arrival of a silver colored train: particularly if they had lived in Stockholm all their life and were unaware of the existence of the un-painted unit.\n\nIf the traveler was tired or drunk at the time, their imagination might have run away with them. The stories that circulated most widely in the 1980s have been retold by the noted Swedish folklorist Bengt af Klintberg, and later featured in the December 10, 1997 installment of \"Det spökar\", a television series dedicated to allegedly real ghost stories and haunted houses.\n\nThere are different versions of this urban legend. Some say that the ghost train has only been seen in abandoned tunnels by subway workers. Others say that anyone can see it passing the stations at high speed after midnight. Some even claim that Silverpilen sometimes stops to pick up passengers, who then disappear forever or later \"get off\" weeks, months or even years after they embarked. The inside of the train is described as being empty, or as containing one or several ghost passengers.\n\nSome stories connect the ghost train with the abandoned Kymlinge metro station on Line 11, the blue line. Kymlinge also has a reputation of being a ghost station, with people saying that \"Bara de döda stiger av i Kymlinge\" (\"Only the dead get off at Kymlinge\"). Some say that it stops at a station that has no exit. Kymlinge station was half-built during the construction of the blue metro lines, in anticipation of a residence area nearby, but the sub-city Sundbyberg decided it would ruin the \"green space\", so nothing was built there.\n\n"}

In 2004, the company was dissolved and sold its assets; Soundogs.com Inc. acquired the trademark and complete archive of the SoundStorm sound effects library.\n\nSoundStorm was founded in 1984 by Gordon Ecker as Walla Works Productions, a sound editorial house and post-production facility in Los Angeles for feature films and television projects. It was owned and operated by practicing sound professionals. In the 1990s the company moved to Burbank from Hollywood after several corporate transitions and name changes. Ecker who was the CEO, retired in 1998 and sold the company to six of the firm's original employees ; Bruce Stambler, John Leveque, Gary Blufer, John Fanaris, Becky Sullivan, and Richard Yawn. Four of the six owners were sound editors. The company developed relationships with off-site editorial and mixing facilities to handle re-recording duties on SoundStorm projects. In 2002, it employed about sixty sound professionals, including ten supervising sound editors. The company also recruited Alan Robert Murray who supervised the sound on twenty-eight Clint Eastwood films.\n\nThe SoundStorm team worked on more than eighty feature films and television projects. It has contributed to the success of notable films as \"Under Siege\" (1992), \"The Fugitive\" (1993), \"Clear and Present Danger\" (1994), \"Batman Forever\" (1995), \"The Ghost and the Darkness\" (1996), \"L.A.

{"id": "252534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=252534", "title": "Topkapı Palace", "text": "Topkapı Palace\n\nThe Topkapı Palace ( or in , \"Ṭopḳapu Sarāyı\"), or the Seraglio, is a large museum in Istanbul, Turkey. In the 15th century, it served as the main residence and administrative headquarters of the Ottoman sultans.\n\nConstruction began in 1459, ordered by Mehmed the Conqueror, six years after the conquest of Constantinople. Topkapı was originally called the \"New Palace\" (\"Yeni Saray\" or \"Saray-ı Cedîd-i Âmire\") to distinguish it from the Old Palace in Beyazıt Square. It was given the name Topkapı, meaning Cannon Gate, in the 19th century. The complex was expanded over the centuries, with major renovations after the 1509 earthquake and the 1665 fire. The palace complex consists of four main courtyards and many smaller buildings. Female members of the Sultan's family lived in the harem, and leading state officials, including the Grand vizier, held meetings in the Imperial Council building.\n\nAfter the 17th century, Topkapı gradually lost its importance. The sultans of that period preferred to spend more time in their new palaces along the Bosphorus. In 1856, Sultan Abdulmejid I decided to move the court to the newly built Dolmabahçe Palace. Topkapı retained some of its functions including the imperial treasury, library and mint.\n\nFollowing the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1923, Topkapı was transformed into a museum by a government decree dated April 3, 1924. The Topkapı Palace Museum is administered by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The palace complex has hundreds of rooms and chambers, but only the most important are accessible to the public today, including the Ottoman imperial harem and the treasury, called \"hazine\" where the Spoonmaker's Diamond and Topkapi Dagger are on display. The museum collection also includes Ottoman clothing, weapons, armor, miniatures, religious relics, and illuminated manuscripts like the Topkapi manuscript. The complex is guarded by officials of the ministry as well as armed guards of the Turkish military. Topkapı Palace is part the Historic Areas of Istanbul, a group of sites in Istanbul that were added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.\n\nThe name of the palace was \"Saray-i Cedid-i Amire\" (Ottoman: سراى جديد عامره, \"Imperial New Palace\") until the 18th century. The palace received its current name during Mahmud I's reign; when \"Topkapusu Sâhil Sarâyı\", the seaside palace, was destroyed in a fire its name was transferred to the Palace. In Turkish the current name of the palace, Topkapı, means \"Cannon Gate\".\n\nThe palace complex is located on the Seraglio Point (\"Sarayburnu\"), a promontory overlooking the Golden Horn, where the Bosphorus Strait meets the Marmara Sea. The terrain is hilly and the palace itself is located at one of the highest points close to the sea. During Greek and Byzantine times, the acropolis of the ancient Greek city of Byzantion stood here.\n\nAfter Sultan Mehmed II's conquest of Istanbul in 1453, the Great Palace of Constantinople was largely in ruins. The Ottoman court was initially set up in the Old Palace (\"Eski Saray\"), today the site of Istanbul University in Beyazit Square. Mehmed II ordered that construction of Topkapı Palace begin in 1459. According to an account of the contemporary historian Critobulus of Imbros the sultan \"took care to summon the very best workmen from everywhere – masons and stonecutters and carpenters ... For he was constructing great edifices which were to be worth seeing and should in every respect vie with the greatest and best of the past.\" Accounts differ as to when construction of the inner core of the palace started and was finished. Kritovolous gives the dates 1459–1465; other sources suggest construction was completed in the late 1460s.\nMehmed II established the basic layout of the palace. His private quarters would be located at the highest point of the promontory. Various buildings and pavilions surrounded the innermost core and winded down the promontory towards the shores of the Bosphorus. The entire complex was surrounded by high walls, some of which date back to the Byzantine acropolis. This basic layout governed the pattern of future renovations and extensions. The layout and appearance of Topkapı Palace was unique amongst not only European travellers, but also Islamic or oriental palaces. European travellers described it as \"irregular, asymmetric, non-axial, and [of] un-monumental proportions\". Ottomans called it \"The Palace of Felicity\". A strict, ceremonial, codified daily life ensured imperial seclusion from the rest of world. One of the central tenets was the observation of silence in the inner courtyards. The principle of imperial seclusion is a tradition that was codified by Mehmed II in 1477 and 1481 in the \"Kanunname\" Code, which regulated the rank order of court officials, the administrative hierarchy, and protocol matters. This principle of increased seclusion over time was reflected in the construction style and arrangements of various halls and buildings. The architects had to ensure that even within the palace, the sultan and his family could enjoy a maximum of privacy and discretion, making use of grilled windows and building secret passageways.\n\nLater sultans made various modifications to the palace, though Mehmed II's basic layout was mostly preseved. The palace was significantly expanded between 1520 and 1560, during the reign of Suleyman the Magnificent. The Ottoman Empire had expanded rapidly and Suleyman wanted his residence to reflect its growing power. The chief architect in this period was the Persian Alaüddin, also known as Acem Ali. He was also responsible for the expansion of the Harem. \n\nIn 1574, after a great fire destroyed the kitchens, Mimar Sinan was entrusted by Sultan Selim II to rebuild the damaged parts of the palace. Mimar Sinan restored and expanded not only the damaged areas, but also the Harem, baths, the Privy Chamber and various shoreline pavilions.\nBy the end of the 16th century, the palace had acquired its present appearance. The palace is an extensive complex rather than a single monolithic structure, with an assortment of low buildings constructed around courtyards, interconnected with galleries and passages. Few of the buildings exceed two stories. Seen from above, the palace grounds are divided into four main courtyards and the harem. The first courtyard was the most accessible, while the fourth courtyard and the harem were the most inaccessible. Access to these courtyards was restricted by high walls and controlled with gates. Apart from the four to five main courtyards, various other small to mid-sized courtyards exist throughout the complex. Estimates of the total size of the complex varies from around to .\n\nTo the west and south the complex is bordered by the large imperial flower park, known today as Gülhane Park. Various related buildings such as small summer palaces (\"kasır\"), pavilions, kiosks (\"köşk\") and other structures for royal pleasures and functions formerly existed at the shore in an area known as the Fifth Courtyard, but have disappeared over time due to neglect and the construction of the shoreline railroad in the 19th century. The last remaining seashore structure that still exists today is the Basketmakers' Kiosk, constructed in 1592 by Sultan Murad III. \n\nThe main street leading to the palace is the Byzantine processional Mese avenue, known today as \"Divan Yolu\" (Council Street). This street was used for imperial processions during the Byzantine and Ottoman era. It leads directly to the Hagia Sophia and turns northwest towards the palace square to the Fountain of Ahmed III.\n\nThe Imperial Gate is the main entrance into the First Courtyard. The sultan would enter the palace through the Imperial Gate ( or \"Saltanat Kapısı\") located to the south of the palace. This massive gate, originally dating from 1478, is now covered in 19th-century marble. Its central arch leads to a high-domed passage; gilded Ottoman calligraphy adorns the structure at the top, with verses from the Qur'an and tughras of the sultans. The tughras of Mehmed II and Abdül Aziz I, who renovated the gate, have been identified.\n\nAccording to old documents, there was a wooden apartment above the gate area until the second half of the 19th century. It has been used as a pavilion by Mehmed, a depository for the properties of those who died inside the palace without heirs and the receiving department of the treasury. It has also been used as a vantage point for the ladies of the harem on special occasions.\n\nSurrounded by high walls, the First Courtyard (\"I. Avlu\" or \"Alay Meydanı\") functioned as an outer precinct or park and is the largest of all the courtyards of the palace. The steep slopes leading towards the sea had already been terraced under Byzantine rule. Some of the historical structures of the First Courtyard no longer exist. The structures that remain are the former Imperial Mint (\"Darphane-i Âmire\", constructed in 1727), the church of Hagia Irene and various fountains. The Byzantine church of Hagia Irene was used by the Ottomans as a storehouse and imperial armoury. This courtyard was also known as the Court of the Janissaries or the Parade Court. Court officials and janissaries would line the path dressed in their best garbs. Visitors entering the palace would follow the path towards the Gate of Salutation and the Second Courtyard of the palace.\n\nThe large Gate of Salutation, also known as the Middle Gate (Turkish: \"Orta Kapı\"), leads into the palace and the Second Courtyard. This crenellated gate has two large, pointed octagonal towers. It's date of construction is uncertain; the architecture of the towers appears to be of Byzantine influence. An inscription at the door dates this gate to at least 1542. The gate is richly decorated with religious inscriptions and monograms of sultans. Passage through the gate was tightly controlled and all visitors had to dismount, since only the sultan was allowed to enter the gate on horseback. This was also a Byzantine tradition taken from the Chalke Gate of the Great Palace. The Fountain of the Executioner (\"Cellat Çeşmesi\") is where the executioner purportedly washed his hands and sword after a decapitation, though there is disagreement about whether the fountain was actually used for this purpose. It is located on the right side when facing the Gate of Salutation from the First Courtyard.\nThrough the middle gate is the Second Courtyard (\"II. Avlu\"), or Divan Square (\"Divan Meydanı\"). The courtyard was probably completed around 1465, during the reign of Mehmed II. It received its final appearance around 1525-1529 during the reign of Suleyman I. It is surrounded by the former palace hospital, bakery, Janissary quarters, stables, the imperial harem and Divan to the north and the kitchens to the south. At the end of the courtyard, the Gate of Felicity marks the entrance to the Third Courtyard. Numerous artifacts from the Roman and Byzantine periods that have been found on the palace site during recent excavations, including sarcophagi, are on display in the Second Courtyard in front of the imperial kitchens. Located underneath the Second Courtyard is a cistern that dates to Byzantine times. During Ottoman times this courtyard would have been full of peacocks and gazelles. It was used as a gathering place for courtiers. The Sultan, seated on the gold-plated Bayram throne, used to hold audiences in the second courtyard. Some foreign dignitaries, including The French ambassador Philippe du Fresne-Canaye, have written accounts about these audiences.\n\nThe imperial stables (\"Istabl-ı Âmire\"), located around five to six meters below ground level, were constructed under Mehmed II and renovated under Suleyman. A vast collection of harness \"treasures\" (\"Raht Hazinesi\") are kept in the privy stables. This area also has a small 18th-century mosque and the bath of Beşir Ağa (\"Beşir Ağa Camii ve Hamamı\"), who was the chief black eunuch of Mahmud I.\n\nAt the end of the imperial stables are the Dormitories of the Halberdiers with Tresses (\"Zülüflü Baltacılar Koğušu\"). The responsibilities of the halberdiers included carrying wood to the palace rooms and service for some of the palace quarters. The halberdiers wore long tresses to signify their higher position. The first mention of this corps is around 1527, when they were established to clear the roads ahead of the army during a campaign. The dormitory was founded in the 15th century. It was enlarged by the chief architect Davud Ağa in 1587, during the reign of Sultan Murad III. The dormitories are constructed around a main courtyard in the traditional layout of an Ottoman house, with baths and a mosque, as well as recreational rooms such as a pipe-room. On the outside and inside of the complex, many pious foundation inscriptions about the various duties and upkeep of the quarters can be found. In contrast to the rest of the palace, the quarters are constructed of red and green painted wood.\n\nThe palace kitchens (\"Saray Mutfakları\") were built when the palace was first constructed in the 15th century and expanded during the reign of Suleyman the Magnificent. They were modeled on the kitchens of Edirne Palace. After the fire of 1574, which damaged the kitchens, they were remodeled by the court architect Mimar Sinan. The rebuilt kitchens form two rows of 20 wide chimneys; these chimneys were added by Mimar Sinan.\n\nThe kitchens are located on an internal street stretching between the Second Courtyard and the Marmara Sea. The entrance to this section is through the three doors in the portico of the Second Courtyard: the Imperial commissariat (lower kitchen) door, imperial kitchen door and the confectionery kitchen door.The palace kitchens consist of 10 domed buildings: Imperial kitchen, (palace school), \"Harem\" (women’s quarters), \"Birûn\" (outer service section of the palace), kitchens, beverages kitchen, confectionery kitchen, creamery, storerooms and rooms for the cooks. They were the largest kitchens in the Ottoman Empire. Food was prepared for about 4,000 people and the kitchen staff consisted of more than 800 people. The kitchens included dormitories, baths and a mosque for the employees, most of which disappeared over time.\n\nApart from exhibiting kitchen utensils, today the buildings contain a silver gifts collection, as well as a large collection of porcelain. The Ottomans had access to Chinese porcelains from the mid-fifteenth century onward. The collection of 10,700 pieces of Chinese porcelain is among the finest porcelain collections in the world. Porcelains often entered the palace collection as parts of the estates of deceased persons, and were sometimes circulated as gifts amongst members of the royal family or other leading officials. Records indicate that by the 18th century the palace collection had 16,566 pieces of Chinese porcelain, compared to 400 pieces in the 16th century and 3,645 pieces in the 17th century. The Chinese porcelain collection ranges from the late Song Dynasty (960-1279) and the Yuan Dynasty (1280–1368), through the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) to the Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). The pieces include celadons as well as blue and white porcelain. The Japanese collection is mainly Imari porcelain, dating from the 17th to the 19th centuries. The collection also includes around 5,000 European pieces. Researchers believe that Ottoman tastes changed over time to favor various types of European porcelain by the 18th century.\n\nThe Imperial Council (\"Dîvân-ı Hümâyûn\") building is the chamber wherethe Imperial Council—consisting of the Grand Vizier (\"Vazīr-e Azam\") and other council ministers (\"Dîvân Heyeti\")—held meetings. The domed chamber of the building is called \"Kubbealtı\", which means \"under the dome\". The council building situated in the northwestern corner of the courtyard next to the Gate of Felicity.\n\nThe Imperial Council building was first built during the reign of Mehmed II. The present building dates from the period of Süleyman the Magnificent; the chief architect was Alseddin. It had to be restored after the Harem fire of 1665. According to the entrance inscription it was also restored during the periods of Selim III and Mahmud II; on its façade are verse inscriptions that mention the restoration work carried out in 1792 and 1819 by Sultan Selim III and Mahmud II. The rococo decorations on the façade and inside the Imperial Council date from this period.\n\nThere are multiple entrances to the council hall, both from inside the palace and from the courtyard. The porch consists of multiple marble and porphyry pillars, with an ornate green and white-coloured wooden ceiling decorated with gold. The exterior entrances into the hall are in the rococo style, with gilded grills to admit natural light. While the pillars are an earlier Ottoman style, the wall paintings and decorations are from the later rococo period. Inside, the Imperial Council building consists of three adjoining main rooms. The 15th century \"Divanhane\", built with a wooden portico at the corner of the Divan Court, was later used as the mosque of the council. There are three domed chambers: the first chamber where the Imperial Council held its deliberations is called the \"Kubbealtı\", the second was occupied by the secretarial staff of the Imperial Council, and the third—called \"Defterhāne\"—is where the head clerks kept records of the council meetings. The main chamber \"Kubbealtı\" is, however, decorated with Ottoman Kütahya tiles.\n\nThe Sultan or the Valide Sultan was able to follow deliberations of the council without being noticed from a window with a golden grill. The window could be reached from the imperial quarters in the adjacent Tower of Justice (\"Adalet Kulesi\"). The window is mentioned for the first time in 1527 by the scholar Celalzade Mustafa Çelebi: \"His Majesty [...] had built a high throne and a lofty loggia above the outer Council Hall where viziers sat, inventing a veiled window overlooking the Council Hall below. From this window, his Noble Excellency sometimes watched the events of the divan, checking the truth of affairs.\" The Tower of Justice (\"Adalet Kulesi\") is located between the Imperial Council and the Harem.\n\nThe Tower of Justice is several stories high and the tallest structure in the palace, making it clearly visible from the Bosphorus as a landmark. The tower was probably originally constructed under Mehmed II and then renovated and enlarged by Suleiman I between 1527-1529. Sultan Mahmud II rebuilt the lantern of the tower in 1825 while retaining the Ottoman base. The tall windows with engaged columns and the Renaissance pediments evoke the Palladian style.\n\nThe building where the arms and armor are exhibited was originally one of the palace treasuries (\"Dîvân-ı Hümâyûn Hazinesi / Hazine-ı Âmire\"). Since there was another (\"inner\") treasury in the Third Courtyard, this one was also called \"outer treasury\" (\"dış hazine\"). Although it contains no dated inscriptions, its construction technique and plan suggest that it was built at the end of the 15th century during the reign of Süleiman I. It subsequently underwent numerous alterations and renovations. It is a hall built of stone and brick with eight domes, each 5 x 11.40 m.\n\nThis treasury was used to finance the administration of the state. The kaftans given as presents to the viziers, ambassadors and residents of the palace by the financial department and the sultan and other valuable objects were also stored here. The janissaries were paid their quarterly wages (called \"uluefe\") from this treasury, which was closed by the imperial seal entrusted to the grand vizier. In 1928, four years after the Topkapı Palace was converted into a museum, its collection of arms and armor was put on exhibition in this building.\n\nDuring excavations in 1937 in front of this building, remains of a religious Byzantine building dating from the 5th century were found. Since it could not be identified with any of the churches known to have been built on the palace site, it is now known as \"the Basilica of the Topkapı Palace\" or simply Palace Basilica.\n\nAlso located outside the treasury building is a target stone (\"Nişan Taşı\"), which is over two metres tall. This stone was erected in commemoration of a record rifle shot by Selim III in 1790. It was brought to the palace from Levend in the 1930s.\n\nThe arms collection (\"Silah Seksiyonu Sergi Salonu\"), which consists primarily of weapons that remained in the palace at the time of its conversion, is one of the richest assemblages of Islamic arms in the world, with examples spanning 1,300 years from the 7th to the 20th centuries. The palace's collection of arms and armor consists of objects manufactured by the Ottomans themselves, or gathered from foreign conquests, or given as presents. Ottoman weapons form the bulk of the collection, but it also includes examples of Umayyad and Abbasid swords, as well as Mamluk and Persian armor, helmets, swords and axes. A lesser number of European and Asian arms make up the remainder of the collection. Currently on exhibition are some 400 weapons, most of which bear inscriptions.\n\nThe Gate of Felicity (\"Bâbüssaâde\" or \"Bab-üs Saadet\") is the entrance into the Inner Court (\"Enderûn\"), also known as the Third Courtyard, marking the border to the Outer Court or \"Birûn\". The Third Courtyard comprises the private and residential areas of the palace. The gate has a dome supported by lean marble pillars. It represents the presence of the Sultan in the palace. No one could pass this gate without the authority of the Sultan. Even the Grand Vizier was only granted authorisation on specified days and under specified conditions.\n\nThe gate was probably constructed under Mehmed II in the 15th century. It was redecorated in the rococo style in 1774 under Sultan Mustafa III and during the reign of Mahmud II. The gate is further decorated with Qur'anic verses above the entrance and \"tuğra\"s. The ceiling is partly painted and gold-leafed, with a golden ball hanging from the middle. The sides with baroque decorative elements and miniature paintings of landscapes.\n\nThe Sultan used this gate and the \"Divan Meydanı\" square only for special ceremonies. The Sultan sat before the gate on his Bayram throne on religious, festive days and accession, when the subjects and officials perform their homage standing. The funerals of the Sultan were also conducted in front of the gate.\n\nOn either side of this colonnaded passage, under control of the Chief Eunuch of the Sultan’s Harem (called the \"Bâbüssaâde Ağası\") and the staff under him, were the quarters of the eunuchs as well as the small and large rooms of the palace school.\n\nThe small, indented stone on the ground in front of the gate marks the place where the banner of Muhammad was unfurled. The Grand Vizier or the commander going to war was entrusted with this banner in a solemn ceremony.\n\nBeyond the Gate of Felicity is the Third Courtyard (\"III. Avlu\"), also called the Inner Palace (\"Enderûn Avlusu\"), which is the heart of the palace. It is a lush garden surrounded by the Hall of the Privy Chamber (\"Has Oda\"), the treasury, the harem and the library of Ahmed III.\n\nThe Third Courtyard is surrounded by the quarters of the \"Ağas\", page boys in the service of the sultan. They were taught the arts, such as music, painting and calligraphy. The best could become the \"Has Oda Ağası\" or high-ranking officials.\n\nThe layout of the Third Courtyard was established by Mehmed II. While Mehmed II would not sleep in the harem, successive sultans after him became more secluded and moved to the more intimate Fourth Courtyard and the harem section.\n\nThe \"Hünername\" miniature from 1584 shows the Third Courtyard and the surrounding outer gardens.\n\nThe Audience Chamber, also known as the Chamber of Petitions (\"Arz Odası\"), is right behind the Gate of Felicity. This square building is an Ottoman kiosk, surrounded by a colonnade of 22 columns supporting the large roof with hanging eaves. The building dates from the 15th century. The ceiling of the chamber was painted in ultramarine blue and studded with golden stars. The walls were lined with blue, white and turquoise tiles. The chamber was further decorated with precious carpets and pillows. The chamber was renovated in 1723 by Sultan Ahmed III. It was destroyed in the fire of 1856 and rebuilt during the reign of Abülmecid I.\n\nThe main throne room is located inside the audience chamber. According to a contemporary account by envoy Cornelius Duplicius de Schepper in 1533: \"The Emperor was seated on a slightly elevated throne completely covered with gold cloth, replete and strewn with numerous precious stones, and there were on all sides many cushions of inestimable value; the walls of the chamber were covered with mosaic works spangled with azure and gold; the exterior of the fireplace of this chamber of solid silver and covered with gold, and at one side of the chamber from a fountain water gushed forth from a wall.\" The present throne in the form of a baldachin was made on the order of Mehmed III. On the lacquered ceiling of the throne, studded with jewels, are foliage patterns accompanied by the depiction of the fight of a dragon, symbol of power, with \"simurg\", a mythical bird. On the throne there is a cover made of several pieces of brocade on which emerald and ruby plaques and pearls are sown.\n\nEembossed inscriptions at the main visitors' door, dating from 1856, contain laudatory words for Sultan Abdülmecid I.The main door is surmounted by an embossed \"besmele\", the common Muslim benediction, meaning \"In the Name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful\", dating from 1723. This inscription was added during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III. The tile panels on either side of the door were placed during later repair work.\n\nThere is a small fountain by the entrance from the time of Suleiman I. The Persian inscriptions calls the sultan \"the fountainhead of generosity, justice and the sea of beneficence.\"\n\nGifts presented by ambassadors were placed in front of the large window in the middle of the main facade between the two doors. The Pişkeş Gate to the left (\"Pişkeş Kapısı\", Pişkeş meaning gift brought to a superior) is surmounted by an inscription from the reign of Mahmud II, which dates from 1810.\n\nBehind the Audience Chamber on the eastern side is the Dormitory of the Expeditionary Force (\"Seferli Koğuşu\"), which houses the Imperial Wardrobe Collection (\"Padişhah Elbiseleri Koleksiyonu\"). This collection is made up of around 2,500 garments, invluding the precious kaftans of the Sultans. It also houses a collection of 360 ceramic objects. The dormitory was constructed under Sultan Murad IV in 1635. The building was restored by Sultan Ahmed III in the early 18th century. The dormitory is vaulted and is supported by 14 columns. Adjacent to the dormitory, located northeast, is the Conqueror's Pavilion, which houses the Imperial Treasury.\n\nThe Conqueror’s Pavilion, also called the \"Conqueror's Kiosk\" (\"Fatih Köşkü\") is one of the oldest buildings inside the palace. It was built c. 1460, when the palace was first constructed. It consists of two floors raised on a terrace above the garden, built at the top of the promontory on a cliff with a magnificent view from its porch of the Sea of Marmara and the Bosporus. The lower floor consisted of service rooms, while the upper floor was a suite of four apartments and a large loggia with double arches. All the rooms open onto the Third Courtyard through a monumental arcade. The colonnaded portico on the side of the garden is connected to each of the four halls by a large door. The pavilion was used as the treasury for the revenues from Egypt under Sultan Selim I. During excavations in the basement, a small Byzantine baptistery built along a trefoil plan was found. It houses the Imperial Treasury (\"Hazine-i Âmire\").\nThe Imperial Treasury is a vast collection of artworks, jewelry, heirlooms and money belonging to the Ottoman dynasty. The Chief Treasurer (\"Hazinedarbaşı\") was responsible for the Imperial Treasury.\n\nThe first room of the treasury houses one of the armours of Sultan Mustafa III, consisting of an iron coat of mail decorated with gold and encrusted with jewels. His gilded sword, shield and stirrups are also on display. The ebony throne of Murad IV, inlaid with nacre and ivory may also be found in this room. Other pieces include several pearl embellished Qur'an covers belonging to the sultans and jewel-encrusted looking glasses. There is a music box from India with a gold elephant dating from the 19th century. \n\nThe second room houses the Topkapı Dagger. The golden hilt is ornamented with three large emeralds, topped by a golden watch with an emerald lid. The golden scabbard is covered with diamonds and enamel. In 1747, the Sultan Mahmud I had this dagger made for Nader Shah of Persia, but the Shah was assassinated in connection with a revolt before the emissary had left the Ottoman Empire's boundaries. This dagger gained more fame as the object of the heist depicted of the film \"Topkapi\". In the middle of the second room stands the walnut throne of Ahmed I, inlaid with nacre and tortoise shell, built by Sedekhar Mehmed Agha. Below the baldachin hangs a golden pendant with a large emerald. The next displays show the ostentatious aigrettes of the sultans and their horses, studded with diamonds, emeralds and rubies. A jade bowl, shaped like a vessel, was a present of Czar Nicholas II of Russia.\n\nThe most eye-catching jewel in the third room is the Spoonmaker's Diamond, set in silver and surrounded in two ranks with 49 cut diamonds. Legend has it that this diamond was bought by a vizier in a bazaar, the owner thinking it was a worthless piece of crystal. Another, perhaps more likely history for the gem places it among the possessions of Tepedeleni Ali Pasha, confiscated by the Sultan after his execution. Still more fanciful and romantic versions link the diamond's origins with Napoleon Bonaparte's mother Letizia Ramolino.\n\nAmong the exhibits are two enormous solid gold candleholders, each weighing 48 kg and mounted with 6,666 cut diamonds, a present of Sultan Abdülmecid I to the Kaaba in the holy city of Mecca. They were brought back to Istanbul shortly before the Ottoman Empire lost control over Mecca. The gold ceremonial Bayram throne, mounted with tourmalines, was made in 1585 by order of the vizier Ibrahim Pasha and presented to Sultan Murad III. This throne would be set up in front of the Gate of Felicity on special audiences.\n\nThe throne of Sultan Mahmud I is the centerpiece of the fourth room. This gold-plated throne in Indian style, decorated with pearls and emeralds, was a gift of the Persian ruler Nader Shah in the 18th century. Another exhibit shows the forearm and the hand of St. John the Baptist (\"Yahya\"), set in a golden covering. Several displays show an assembly of flintlock guns, swords, spoons, all decorated with gold and jewels. Of special interest is the gold shrine that used to contain the cloak of Mohammed.\n\nAdjacent to the north of the Imperial Treasury lays the pages dormitory, which has been turned into the Miniature and Portrait Gallery (\"Müzesi Müdüriyeti\"). On the lower floor is a collection of important calligraphies and miniatures. In the displays, one can see old and very precious Qur'ans (12th to 17th centuries), hand-painted and hand-written in Kufic, and also a Bible from the 4th century, written in Arabic. A priceless item of this collection is the first world map by the Turkish admiral Piri Reis (1513). The map shows parts of the western coasts of Europe and North Africa with reasonable accuracy, and the coast of Brazil is also easily recognizable. The upper part of the gallery contains 37 portraits of different sultans, most of which are copies since the original paintings are too delicate to be publicly shown. The portrait of Mehmed II was painted by the Venetian painter Gentile Bellini. Other precious Ottoman miniature paintings that are either kept in this gallery, the palace library or in other parts are the \"Hünername\", \"Sahansahname\", the \"Sarayı Albums\", \"Siyer-ı Nebi\", \"Surname-ı Hümayun\", \"Surname-ı Vehbi\", and the \"Süleymanname\" among many others.\n\nThe Neo-classical Enderûn Library (\"Enderûn Kütüphanesi\"), also known as \"Library of Sultan Ahmed III\" (\"III. Ahmed Kütüphanesi\"), is located directly behind the Audience Chamber (\"Arz Odası\") in the centre of the Third Court. It was built on the foundations of the earlier \"Havuzlu\" kiosk by the royal architect Mimar Beşir Ağa in 1719 on orders of Ahmed III for use by officials of the royal household. The colonnade of this earlier kiosk now probably stands in front of the present Treasury.\n\nThe library is a beautiful example of Ottoman architecture of the 18th century. The exterior of the building is faced with marble. The library has the form of a Greek cross with a domed central hall and three rectangular bays. The fourth arm of the cross consists of the porch, which can be approached by a flight of stairs on either side. Beneath the central arch of the portico is an elaborate drinking fountain with niches on each side. The building is set on a low basement to protect the precious books of the library against moisture.\n\nThe walls above the windows are decorated with 16th- and 17th-century İznik tiles of variegated design. The central dome and the vaults of the rectangular bays have been painted. The decoration inside the dome and vaults are typical of the so-called Tulip period, which lasted from 1703 to 1730. The books were stored in cupboards built into the walls. The niche opposite the entrance was the private reading corner of the sultan.\n\nThe library contained books on theology, Islamic law and similar works of scholarship in Ottoman Turkish, Arabic and Persian. The library collection consisted of more than 3,500 manuscripts. Some are fine examples of inlay work with nacre and ivory. Today these books are kept in the Mosque of the Ağas (\"Ağalar Camii\"), which is located to the west of the library. One of the most important items there is the Topkapi manuscript, a copy of the Qur'an from the time of the third Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan.\n\nThe Mosque of the Ağas (\"Ağalar Camii\") is the largest mosque in the palace. It is also one of the oldest constructions, dating from the 15th century during the reign of Mehmed II. The Sultan, the ağas and pages would come here to pray. The mosque is aligned in a diagonal line in the courtyard to make the minbar face Mecca. In 1928 the books of the Enderûn Library, among other works, were moved here as the Palace Library (\"Sarayı Kütüphanesi\"), housing a collection of about 13,500 Turkish, Arabic, Persian and Greek books and manuscripts, collected by the Ottomans. Located next to the mosque to the northeast is the Imperial Portraits Collection.\n\nThe Dormitory of the Royal Pages (\"Hasoda Koğuşu\") houses the Imperial Portraits Collection (\"Padişah Portreleri Sergi Salonu\") was part of the Sultan's chambers. The painted portraits depict all the Ottoman sultans and some rare photographs of the later ones, the latter being kept in glass cases. The room is air-conditioned and the temperature regulated and monitored to protect the paintings. Since the sultans rarely appeared in public, and to respect Islamic sensitivity to artistic depictions of people, the earlier portraits are idealisations. Only since the reforms of the moderniser Mahmud II have realistic portraits of the rulers been made. An interesting feature is a large painted family tree of the Ottoman rulers. The domed chamber is supported by pillars, some of Byzantine origin since a cross is engraved on one of them.\n\nThe Privy Chamber houses the Chamber of the Sacred Relics (\"Kutsal Emanetler Dairesi\"), which includes the Pavilion of the Holy Mantle. The chamber was constructed by Sinan under the reign of Sultan Murad III. It used to house offices of the Sultan.\n\nIt houses what are considered to be \"the most sacred relics of the Muslim world\": the cloak of Muhammad, two swords, a bow, one tooth, a hair of his beard, his battle sabres, an autographed letter and other relics which are known as the Sacred Trusts. Several other sacred objects are on display, such as the swords of the first four Caliphs, The Staff of Moses, the turban of Joseph and a carpet of the daughter of Mohammed. Even the Sultan and his family were permitted entrance only once a year, on the 15th day of Ramadan, during the time when the palace was a residence. Now any visitor can see these items, although in very dim light to protect the relics, and many Muslims make a pilgrimage for this purpose.\n\nThe Arcade of the Chamber of the Holy Mantle was added in the reign of Murad III, but was altered when the Circumcision Room was added. This arcade may have been built on the site of the Temple of Poseidon that was transformed before the 10th century into the Church of St. Menas.\n\nThe Privy Chamber was converted into an accommodation for the officials of the Mantle of Felicity in the second half of the 19th century by adding a vault to the colonnades of the Privy Chamber in the Enderun Courtyard.\n\nThe Imperial Harem (\"Harem-i Hümayûn\") occupied one of the sections of the private apartments of the sultan; it contained more than 400 rooms. The harem was home to the sultan's mother, the Valide Sultan; the concubines and wives of the sultan; and the rest of his family, including children; and their servants. The harem consists of a series of buildings and structures, connected through hallways and courtyards. Every service team and hierarchical group residing in the harem had its own living space clustered around a courtyard. The number of rooms is not determined, with probably over 100, of which only a few are open to the public. These apartments (\"Daires\") were occupied respectively by the harem eunuchs, the Chief Harem Eunuch (\"Darüssaade Ağası\"), the concubines, the queen mother, the sultan's consorts, the princes and the favourites. There was no trespassing beyond the gates of the harem, except for the sultan, the queen mother, the sultan's consorts and favourites, the princes and the concubines as well as the eunuchs guarding the harem.\n\nThe harem wing was only added at the end of the 16th century. Many of the rooms and features in the Harem were designed by Mimar Sinan. The harem section opens into the Second Courtyard (\"Divan Meydanı\"), which the Gate of Carriages (\"Arabalar Kapısı\") also opens to. The structures expanded over time towards the Golden Horn side and evolved into a huge complex. The buildings added to this complex from its initial date of construction in the 15th century to the early 19th century capture the stylistic development of palace design and decoration. Parts of the harem were redecorated under the sultans Mahmud I and Osman III in an Italian-inspired Ottoman Baroque style. These decorations contrast with those of the Ottoman classical age.\n\nThe entrance gate from the Second Courtyard is the Gate of Carts (\"Arabalar Kapısı\"), which leads into the Domed Cupboard Room (\"Dolaplı Kubbe\"). This place was built as a vestibule to the harem in 1587 by Murad III. The harem treasury worked here. In its cupboards, records of deeds of trust were kept, administered by the Chief Harem Eunuch. This treasury stored money from the pious foundations of the harem and other foundations, and financial records of the sultans and the imperial family.\n\nThe Hall of the Ablution Fountain, also known as \"Sofa with Fountain\" (\"Şadirvanli Sofa\"), was renovated after the Harem fire of 1666. This second great fire took place on 24 July 1665. This space was an entrance hall into the harem, guarded by the harem eunuchs. The \"Büyük Biniş\" and the \"Şal Kapısı\", which connected the Harem, the Privy Garden, the Mosque of the Harem Eunuchs and the Tower of Justice from where the sultan watched the deliberations of the Imperial Council, led to this place.\nThe walls are revetted with 17th-century Kütahya tiles.\nThe horse block in front of the mosque served the sultan to mount his horse and the sitting benches were for the guards.\nThe fountain that gives the space its name was moved and is now in the pool of the Privy Chamber of Murad III.\n\nOn the left is the small mosque of the black eunuchs. The tiles in watery green, dirty white and middle blue all date from the 17th century (reign of Mehmed IV). Their design is of a high artistic level but the execution is of minor quality compared to 16th-century tiles, and the paint on these tiles blurs.\n\nAnother door leads to the Courtyard of the (Black) Eunuchs (\"Harem Ağaları Taşlığı\"), with their apartments on the left side. At the end of the court is the apartment of the black chief eunuch (\"Kızlar Ağası\"), the fourth high-ranking official in the official protocol. In between is the school for the imperial princes, with precious tiles from the 17th and 18th centuries and gilded wainscoting. At the end of the court is the main gate to the harem (\"Cümle Kapısi\"). The narrow corridor on the left side leads to the apartments of the odalisques (white slaves given as a gift to the sultan).\n\nMany of the eunuchs’ quarters face this courtyard, which is the first one of the Harem, since they also acted as guards under the command of the Chief Harem Eunuch.\nThe spaces surrounding this courtyard were rebuilt after the great fire of 1665. The complex includes the dormitory of the Harem eunuchs behind the portico, the quarters of the Chief Harem Eunuch (\"Darüssaade Ağası\") and the School of Princes as well as the Gentlemen-in-Waiting of the Sultan (\"Musahipler Dairesi\") and the sentry post next to it. The main entrance gate of the Harem and the gate of the Kuşhane connected the Enderûn court leads out into the Kuşhane door.\n\nThe dormitories of the Harem eunuchs (\"Harem Ağaları Koğuşu\") date to the 16th century. They are arranged around an inner courtyard in three storeys.\nThe inscription on the facade of the dormitory includes the deeds of trust of the Sultans Mustafa IV, Mahmud II and Abdül Mecid I dating from the 19th century.\nThe rooms on the upper stories were for novices and those below overlooking the courtyard were occupied by the eunuchs who had administrative functions.\nThere is a monumental fireplace revetted with the 18th-century Kütahya tiles at the far end.\nThe Chief Harem Eunuch's apartment (\"Darüssaade Ağasi Dairesi\") adjacent to the dormitory contains a bath, living rooms and bedrooms.\nThe school room of the princes under the control of the Chief Harem eunuch was on the upper story.\nThe walls were revetted with 18th-century European tiles with baroque decorations.\n\nThe main entrance (\"Cümle Kapisi\") separates the harem in which the family and the concubines of the sultan resided from the Courtyard of the Eunuchs. The door leads out into the sentry post (\"Nöbet Yeri\") to which the three main sections of the harem are connected. The door on the left of the sentry post leads through the Passage of the Concubines to the Court of the Concubines (\"Kadınefendiler Taşlığı\"). The door in the middle leads to the Court of the Queen Mother (\"Valide Taşlığı\") and the door to the right leads through the Golden Road (\"Altınyol\") to the sultan's quarters. The large mirrors in this hall date from the 18th century.\n\nAfter the main entrance and before turning to the Passage of Concubines is the Courtyard of the Queen Mother.\n\nThe Passage of Concubines (\"Cariye Koridoru\") leads into the Courtyard of the Sultan's Chief Consorts and Concubines.\nOn the counters along the passage, the eunuchs placed the dishes they brought from the kitchens in the palace.\n\nThe Courtyard of the Sultan's Consorts and the Concubines (\"Kadın Efendiler Taşlığı / Cariye Taşlığı\") was constructed at the same time as the courtyard of the eunuchs in the middle of the 16th century.\nIt underwent restoration after the 1665 fire and is the smallest courtyard of the Harem.\nThe porticoed courtyard is surrounded by baths (\"Cariye Hamamı\"), a laundry fountain, a laundry, dormitories, the apartments of the Sultan's chief consort and the apartments of the stewardesses (\"Kalfalar Dairesi\").\nThe three independent tiled apartments with fireplaces overlooking the Golden Horn were the quarters where the consorts of the Sultan lived. These constructions covered the site of the courtyard in the late 16th century.\nAt the entrance to the quarters of the Queen Mother, wall frescoes from the late 18th century depict landscapes, reflecting the western influence.\nThe staircase, called the \"Forty Steps\" (\"Kirkmerdiven\"), leads to the Hospital of the Harem (\"Harem Hastanesi\"), the dormitories of the concubines at the basement of the Harem and Harem Gardens.\n\nThe Apartments of the Queen Mother (\"Valide Sultan Dairesi\"), together with the apartments of the sultan, form the largest and most important section in the harem. It was constructed after the Queen Mother moved into the Topkapı Palace in the late 16th century from the Old Palace (\"Eski Saray\"), but had to be rebuilt after the fire of 1665 between 1666-1668. Some rooms, such as the small music room, have been added to this section in the 18th century.\nOnly two of these rooms are open to the public: the dining room with, in the upper gallery, the reception room and her bedroom with, behind a lattice work, a small room for prayer. On the lower stories of the apartments are the quarters of the concubines, while the upper story rooms are those of the Queen Mother and her ladies-in-waiting (\"kalfas\"). The apartments of the Queen Mother are connected by a passage, leading into the Queen Mother's bathroom, to the quarters of the sultan.\n\nThese are all enriched with blue-and-white or yellow-and-green tiles with flowery motifs and İznik porcelain from the 17th century. The panel representing Mecca or Medina, signed by Osman İznikli Mehmetoğlu, represents a new style in İznik tiles. The paintwork with panoramic views in the upper rooms is in the Western European style of the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nSituated on top of the apartments of the Queen Mother are the apartments of Mihirisah in the rococo style.\nLeading from the apartments to the baths lays the apartment of Abdül Hamid I. Close to that is Selim's III love chamber constructed in 1790. A long, narrow corridor connects this to the kiosk of Osman III dated to 1754.\n\nThe next rooms are the Baths of the Sultan and the Queen Mother (\"Hünkâr ve Vâlide Hamamları\"). This double bath dates from the late 16th century and consists of multiple rooms. It was redecorated in the rococo style in the middle of the 18th century. Both baths present the same design, consisting of a caldarium, a tepidarium and a frigidarium. Each room either has a dome, or the ceilings are at some point glassed in a honeycomb structure to let the natural sunlight in. The floor is clad in white and grey marble. The marble tub with an ornamental fountain in the caldarium and the gilded iron grill are characteristic features. The golden lattice work was to protect the bathing sultan or his mother from murder attempts. The sultan's bath was decorated by Sinan with high-quality İznik polychrome tiles. But much of the tile decoration of the harem, from structures damaged by the fire of 1574, was recycled by Sultan Ahmed I for decoration in his new Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul. The walls are now either clad in marble or white-washed.\n\nThe Imperial Hall (\"Hünkâr Sofası\"), also known as the Imperial Sofa, Throne Room Within or Hall of Diversions, is a domed hall in the Harem, believed to have been built in the late 16th century. It has the largest dome in the palace. The hall served as the official reception hall of the sultan as well as for the entertainment of the Harem. Here the sultan received his confidants, guests, his mother, his first wife (\"Hasseki\"), consorts, and his children. Entertainments, paying of homage during religious festivals, and wedding ceremonies took place here in the presence of the members of the dynasty.\n\nAfter the Great Harem Fire of 1666, the hall was renovated in the rococo style during the reign of Sultan Osman III. The tile belt surrounding the walls bearing calligraphic inscriptions were revetted with 18th-century blue-and-white Delftware and mirrors of Venetian glass. But the domed arch and pendantives still bear classical paintings dating from the original construction.\n\nIn the hall stands the sultan's throne. The gallery was occupied by the consorts of the sultan, headed by the Queen Mother. The gilded chairs are a present of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, while the clocks are a gift of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. A pantry, where musical instruments are exhibited, opens to the Imperial Hall, which provides access into the sultan's private apartments.\n\nA secret door behind a mirror allowed the sultan a safe passage. One door admits to the Queen Mother’s apartments, another to the sultan's hammam. The opposite doors lead to the small dining chamber (rebuilt by Ahmed III) and the great bedchamber, while the other admits to a series of ante-chambers, including the room with the fountain (\"Çeşmeli Sofa\"), which were all retiled and redecorated in the 17th century.\n\nThe Privy Chamber of Murat III (\"III. Murad Has Odası\") is the oldest and finest surviving room in the harem, having retained its original interior. It was a design of the master architect Sinan and dates from the 16th century. Its dome is only slightly smaller than that of the Throne Room. Its hall has one of the finest doors of the palace and leads past the wing of the crown princes (\"Kafes\"). The room is decorated with blue-and-white and coral-red İznik tiles. The rich floral designs are framed in thick orange borders of the 1570s. A band of inscriptional tiles runs around the room above the shelf and door level. The large arabesque patterns of the dome have been regilded and repainted in black and red. The large fireplace with gilded hood (\"ocak\") stands opposite a two-tiered fountain (\"çeşme\"), skilfully decorated in coloured marble. The flow of water was meant to prevent any eavesdropping, while providing a relaxed atmosphere to the room. The two gilded baldachin beds date from the 18th century.\n\nOn the other side of the great bedchamber there are two smaller rooms: first the Privy Chamber of Ahmed I (\"I. Ahmed Has Odası\"), richly decorated with İznik glazed tiles. The cabinet doors, the window shutters, a small table and a Qur'an lectern are decorated with nacre and ivory.\n\nNext to it is the small but very colourful Privy Chamber of Ahmed III (\"III. Ahmed Has Odası\") with walls painted with panels of floral designs and bowls of fruit and with an intricate tiles fireplace (\"ocak\"). This room is therefore also known as the Fruit Room (\"Yemis Odası\") and was probably used for dining purposes.\n\nThe Twin Kiosk / Apartments of the Crown Prince (\"Çifte Kasırlar / Veliahd Dairesi\") consists of two privy chambers built in the 17th century, at different times. The building is connected to the palace and consists of only one storey built on an elevated platform to give a better view from inside and shield views from the outside.\n\nThe interior consists of two large rooms, dating from the reign of Sultan Murat III, but are more probably from the reign of Ahmed I. The ceiling is not flat but conical in the kiosk style, evoking the traditional tents of the early Ottomans. As in tents, there is no standing furniture but sofas set on the carpeted floor on the side of the walls for seating.\nThese chambers represent all the details of the classical style used in other parts of the palace.\nThe pavilion has been completely redecorated, and most of the Baroque woodwork has been removed. The decorative tiles, reflecting the high quality craftsmanship of the İznik tile industry of the 17th century, were removed in accordance with the original concept and replaced with modern copies. The paintwork of the wooden dome is still original and is an example of the rich designs of the late 16th/early 17th centuries. The fireplace in the second room has a tall, gilded hood and has been restored to its original appearance. The window shutters next to the fireplace are decorated with nacre intarsia. The windows in coloured glass look out across the high terrace and the garden of the pool below. The spigots in these windows are surrounded with red, black and gold designs.\n\nThe crown prince (\"Şehzadeler\") lived here in seclusion; therefore, the apartments were also called \"kafes\" (cage). The crown prince and other princes were trained in the discipline of the Ottoman Harem until they reached adulthood. Afterwards, they were sent as governors to Anatolian provinces, where they were further trained in the administration of state affairs. From the beginning of the 17th century onward, the princes lived in the Harem, which started to have a voice in the palace administration. The Twin Kiosk was used as the privy chamber of the crown prince from the 18th century onward.\n\nThe Courtyard of the Favourites (\"Gözdeler / Mabeyn Taşlığı ve Dairesi\") forms the last section of the Harem and overlooks a large pool and the Boxwood Garden (\"Şimşirlik Bahçesi\"). The courtyard was expanded in the 18th century by the addition of the Interval (\"Mabeyn\") and Favourites (\"İkballer\") apartments. The apartment of the Sultan's Favourite Consort along with the Golden Road (\"Altın Yol\") and the Mabeyn section at the ground floor also included the Hall with the Mirrors. This was the space where Abül Hamid I lived with his harem. The wooden apartment is decorated in the rococo style.\n\nThe favourites of the sultan (\"Gözdeler / İkballer\") were conceived as the instruments of the perpetuation of the dynasty in the harem organisation. When the favourites became pregnant they assumed the title and powers of the official consort (\"Kadınefendi\") of the sultan.\n\nThe Golden Road (\"Altınyol\") is a narrow passage that forms the axis of the Harem, dating from the 15th century. It extends between the Courtyard of the Harem Eunuch (\"Harem Ağaları Taşlığı\") and the Privy Chamber (\"Has Oda\").\nThe sultan used this passage to pass to the Harem, the Privy Chamber and the Sofa-i Hümâyûn, the Imperial terrace.\nThe Courtyard of the Queen Mother (\"Valide Sultan Taşlığı’\"), the Courtyard of the Chief Consort of the Sultan (\"Baş Haseki\"), the apartments of the Princes (\"Şehzadegân Daireleri\"), and the apartments of the Sultan (\"Hünkâr Dairesi\") open to this passage. The walls are painted a plain white colour.\nIt is believed that the attribute \"golden\" is due to the sultan's throwing of golden coins to be picked up by the concubines at festive days, although this is disputed by some scholars.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, there had been a small inner court in this corner of the Enderûn Courtyard. This court led through the Kuşhane Gate into the harem. Today this is the gate from which the visitors exit from the Harem. Birds were raised for the sultan's table in the buildings around the gate. On the inscription over the Kuşhane door one reads that Mahmud I had the kitchen of the Kuşhane repaired. The balcony of the aviary facing the Harem Gate was constructed during repair work in 1916. The building's facade resembles traditional aviaries.\nThe Fourth Courtyard (\"IV. Avlu\"), also known as the Imperial Sofa (\"Sofa-ı Hümâyûn\"), was more of an innermost private sanctuary of the sultan and his family, and consists of a number of pavilions, kiosks (\"köşk\"), gardens and terraces. It was originally a part of the Third Courtyard but recent scholars have identified it as more separate to better distinguish it.\n\nIn 1640 Sultan Ibrahim I added the Circumcision Room (\"Sünnet Odası\"), a summer kiosk (\"Yazlik Oda\") dedicated to the circumcision of young princes, which is a religious tradition in Islam for cleanliness and purity. Its interior and exterior are decorated with a mixed collection of rare recycled tiles such as the blue tiles with flower motifs at the exterior. The most important of these are the blue and white tile panels influenced by far-eastern ceramics on the chamber facade, dated 1529. These once embellished ceremonial buildings of Sultan Suleiman I, such as the building of the Council Hall and the Inner Treasury (both in the Second Courtyard) and the Throne Room (in the Third Courtyard). They were moved here out of nostalgia and reverence for the golden age of his reign. These tiles then served as prototypes for the decoration of the Yerevan and Baghdad kiosks. The room itself is symmetrically proportioned and relatively spacious for the palace, with windows, each with a small fountain. The windows above contain some stained-glass panels. On the right side of the entrance stands a fireplace with a gilded hood. Sultan Ibrahim also built the arcaded roof around the Chamber of the Holy Mantle and the upper terrace between this room and the Baghdad kiosk.\n\nThe royal architect Hasan Ağa under Sultan Murat IV constructed during 1635-1636 the Yerevan Kiosk (\"Revan Köşkü\") and in 1638-1639 the Baghdad Kiosk (\"Bağdat Köşkü\") to celebrate the Ottoman victories at Yerevan and Baghdad. Both contain most of their original decoration, with projecting eaves, a central dome and interior with recessed cupboards and woodwork with inlaid nacre tesserae. Both are based on the classical four-iwan plan with sofas filling the rectangular bays.\n\nThe Yerevan Kiosk (\"Revan Köşkü\") served as a religious retreat of 40 days. It is a rather small pavilion with a central dome and three apses for sofas and textiles. The fourth wall contains the door and a fireplace. The wall facing the colonnade is set with marble, the other walls with low-cost İznik blue-and-white tiles, patterned after those of a century earlier.\n\nThe Baghdad Kiosk (\"Bağdad Köşkü\") is situated on the right side of the terrace with a fountain. It was built to commemorate the Baghdad Campaign of Murad IV after 1638.\n\nIt closely resembles the Yerevan Kiosk. The three doors to the porch are located between the sofas. The façade is covered with marble, strips of porphyry and verd antique. The marble panelling of the portico is executed in Cairene Mamluk style. The interior is an example of an ideal Ottoman room. The recessed shelves and cupboards are decorated with early 16th-century green, yellow and blue tiles. The blue-and-white tiles on the walls are copies of the tiles of the Circumcision Room, right across the terrace. With its tiles dating to the 17th century, mother-of-pearl, tortoise-shell decorated cupboard and window panels, this pavilion is one of the last examples of the classical palace architecture.\n\nThe doors have very fine inlay work. On the right side of the entrance is a fireplace with a gilded hood. In the middle of the room is a silver 'mangal' (charcoal stove), a present of King Louis XIV of France. From the mid-18th century onwards, the building was used as the library of the Privy Chamber.\n\nThe gilded İftar Pavilion, also known as İftar Kiosk or İftar bower (\"İftariye Köşkü\" or \"İftariye Kameriyesi\") offers a view on the Golden Horn and is a magnet for tourists today for photo opportunities. Its ridged cradle vault with the gilded roof was a first in Ottoman architecture with echoes of China and India. The sultan is reported to have had the custom to break his fast under this bower during the fasting month of ramadan after sunset. Some sources mention this resting place as the \"Moonlit Seat\". Special gifts like the showering of gold coins to officials by the sultan also sometimes occurred here. The marbled terrace gained its current appearance during the reign of Sultan Ibrahim (1640–48).\n\nThe rectilinear Terrace Kiosk (\"Sofa Köşku / Merdiven Başı Kasrı\"), also erroneously known as Kiosk of Kara Mustafa Pasha (\"Mustafa Paşa Köşkü\"), was a belvedere built in the second half of the 16th century. It was restored in 1704 by Sultan Ahmed III and rebuilt in 1752 by Mahmud I in the Rococo style. It is the only wooden building in the innermost part of the palace. It consists of rooms with the backside supported by columns.\n\nThe kiosk consists of the main hall called \"Divanhane\", the prayer room (\"Namaz Odası\" or \"Şerbet Odası\") and the Room for Sweet Fruit Beverages. From the kiosk the sultan would watch sporting events in the garden and organised entertainments. This open building with large windows was originally used as a restroom and later, during the Tulip era (1718–1730), as a lodge for guests. It is situated next to the Tulip Garden.\n\nThe square Tower of the Head Tutor (\"Başlala Kulesi\"), also known as the Chamber of the Chief Physician and court drugstore (\"Hekimbaşı Odası ve ilk eczane\"), dates from the 15th century, and is the oldest building in the Fourth Courtyard. It was built as a watch tower, probably during the time of Mehmed II. It has few windows, and its walls are almost two metres thick. The physician had his private chamber at the top, while below was a store for drugs and medicine.\n\nThe first court pharmacy was established during the reign of Mehmed II. There were also other pharmacies and infirmaries at the palace besides this particular one. According to a legend, Enderunlu Tayyar Efendi, who was the Chief Tutor (\"Baş Lala\") during the reign of Sultan Selim III, saw from the upper floor of this tower the rebels coming to the palace to assassinate the sultan and alarmed the sultan's loyalists. The historian Afa writes that the tower was more than two floors higher than today but today it only has two storeys left.\n\nThe Chief Physician (\"Hekim Başı\") and the Chief Tutor shared this place as their residence. The Chief Physician was responsible for the health of the sultan and the imperial family and used to prepare the medicines here. Under his supervision and those of the chief tutor the palace drugs were prepared, mixed and sealed in bottles, jars, boxes or bowls and given to the patients.\n\nThe Chief Physician was also a companion of the sultan outside the palace, accompanying him even on battles. The office of the chief physician was traditionally held by Jews. After the 17th century, there were increasingly Muslim physicians along with Jewish and European physicians. The last Chief Physician was Abdülhak Molla, who lived during the reign of Sultan Abdülmecid I. After the sultan moved away from Topkapı, the tower was used as a music conservatory and later used for the cleaning of palace arms. It was restored in 1911 and houses the medical objects collection.\n\nA stone throne (\"Taş Taht\") was made for Murad IV to watch the sports activities of pages. The inscription on the throne states that in 1636 Murad IV, who was an accomplished sportsman himself, threw an oak cudgel 120 meters.\n\nThe Grand Kiosk, also known as the Mecidiye Kiosk, Grand Pavilion or Kiosk of Abdül Mecid I (\"Mecidiye Köşkü\"), built in 1840, was the last significant addition to the palace, along with the neighbouring Wardrobe Chamber (\"Esvap Odası\"). Both were built on the orders of Sultan Abdül Mecid I as an imperial reception and resting place because of its splendid location, giving a panoramic view on the Sea of Marmara and the Bosphorus. The sultans would stay here whenever they visited Topkapı from their seaside palaces. These constructions were erected on the vaulted basement of another kiosk dating from the 15th century. The architect Sarkis Balyan constructed it in an eclectic Europeanized style, mixed with traditional Ottoman style. Inside it is furnished in the Empire style. The two buildings were also used occasionally to accommodate foreign guests.\nLocated next to the Grand Kiosk is a popular and high-end restaurant. The restaurant has been visited by guests such as Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, First Lady Jackie Kennedy, President Richard Nixon, and boxer Mohammed Ali, among many others. The terrace of the restaurant offers a panoramic view of the Bosphorus and the Asian side. Most tourists come here to take pictures of the sea and the city.\n\nThe Terrace Mosque, also called Sofa Mosque (\"Sofa Camii\"), was constructed under Mahmud II in the Empire style for the use of the corps called \"Sofa Ocağ\"i in the 19th century. The Kiosk of the Swordbearer (\"Silahdar Köşkü\") used to stand in its place. The inscription at the gate of the mosque indicated that it was restored under Sultan Abdülmecid I in 1858.\n\nSurrounding the whole complex of the First to the Fourth Courtyard are the outer palace gardens. A part of this area that is facing the sea is also known as the Fifth Place.\n\nMehmed II also had three pavilions, or kiosks, constructed, of which only the Tiled Kiosk (\"Çinili Köşkü\") has survived. The Tiled Pavilion dates to around 1473 and houses the Islamic ceramics collection of the Istanbul Archaeology Museums.\n\nAlong the shore a number of pavilions were constructed for the sultan's viewing pleasure. These included the Shore Kiosk, Pearl Kiosk, Marble Kiosk and the Basketmakers' Kiosk. Most of the pavilions along with some of the seaside walls and gates were destroyed when the railway lines leading to the Sirkeci railway station were constructed in the late 19th century. The Basketmakers' Kiosk however was saved.\n\nLocated next to the First Courtyard towards the city lies the Gülhane Park, the old imperial rose garden, which belonged to the larger complex of the palace. This park is open to the public. Located at the gate to the park is the Procession Kiosk.\n\nThe trees in the Topkapı Palace complex are remarkable, as many have fallen victim to a fungus that has completely hollowed out their trunks, over the course of centuries. The trees nonetheless survive and remain standing. In other cases, two trees of a different kind have grown and fused together, such as a fig tree that grew in the hollow of another tree and effectively grafted with it. This phenomenon can be seen in the second courtyard.\n\nThe palace has been deemed lax on security and preservation by some experts, who point out that the palace has no climate-controlled rooms or storage and is a \"security nightmare\".\n\nSince many of the walls of the palace are ten feet thick, it mostly escaped structural damage during the 1999 İzmit earthquake. Following this catastrophe, the museum director placed the porcelain collection on more secure mounts in the palace.\n\nDuring a 1999 robbery, thieves stole portions of a 12th-century Qur'an from a locked exhibit in the library.\n\nOn November 30, 2011, Libyan ex-police and revolutionary Samir Salem Ali Elmadhavri, apparently copying the act of Norwegian extremist Anders Behring Breivik, attempted to massacre hundreds of tourists visiting the Palace in the early hours. Stopped at the Bab-i Humayun entrance by the Palace Guards, he opened fire on soldiers and security guards, injuring Private Şerafettin Eray Topçu and security guard Mehmet Ballıcı. After that he entered the main courtyard of the palace but was forced to retreat and search shelter in the entrance by Palace Guard force. After a gunfight lasting over one hour he was killed by Turkish Police SWAT teams. The incident sparked discussions about Palace security, because a foreigner was able to enter the Palace in broad daylight, during working hours, while carrying two hunting rifles. More security measures were put in place at the Palace entrance the day after the incident.\n\nThe resort hotel World Of Wonders Resorts & Hotels Topkapı Palace in Antalya is a reconstruction of some of the buildings, such as the Audience Chamber, the palace kitchens and the Tower of Justice.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6780514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6780514", "title": "Venue (magazine)", "text": "Venue (magazine)\n\nVenue was the listings magazine for the Bristol and Bath areas of the UK. It was founded in 1982 by journalists who had been working for another Bristol magazine, \"Out West\", which had been consciously modelled on London's Time Out magazine.\n\nOriginally published fortnightly, \"Venue\" gained a reputation for the quality and authority of its coverage of the local arts and entertainments scene. It played a leading part in re-establishing Ashton Court Festival and was an early champion of the Bristol Sound in the early 1990s. It continued to play a significant role in nurturing and promoting local art, theatre, film and music until its closure in April 2012. \"Venue\"'s last editor was the playwright Tom Wainwright.\n\n\"Venue\" also had a reputation for investigative reporting of local issues, including health, policing, local politics and environmental matters. \"Venue\" also featured humour and satire which many found attractive, but which was occasionally criticised as puerile. Stand-up comedian Mark Watson and comedy scriptwriter Stephen Merchant both worked for \"Venue\" when they were younger. Author and reviewer Kim Newman contributed regularly. Another author, Eugene Byrne, one of the magazine's founders, remained involved with it as Consulting Editor until the magazine ceased publication.\n\nIn 2000 the company was sold to Bristol United Press (BUP), the company which runs the Bristol Evening Post and Western Daily Press newspapers. BUP in turn was owned by the Northcliffe Newspaper Group, part of the Daily Mail & General Trust group. The takeover by BUP was controversial with many readers, advertisers and staff, particularly because the conservative political outlook of the Daily Mail was very different to that of \"Venue\".\n\nIn 2001, \"Venue\" magazine started to publish weekly, and, trading as Venue Publishing, the company diversified further in the years after this. It produced a successful controlled circulation lifestyle monthly, \"Folio\" (whose closure was announced in March 2013, with the April 2013 edition being its last published issue), as well as several annual guides including Eating Out West, Drinking Out West, Days Out West, a Student Guide for Bristol and Bath and a Festival Guide. Venue Publishing also undertook contract publishing, particularly for large local events such as the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta and the Bristol Harbour Festival. In 2005, Venue Publishing established an in-house design agency, Bang, offering design services to external clients.\n\nThe magazine was briefly associated with some other provincial listings magazines in the 1980s like Manchester's [\"[City Life (magazine)|City Life]]\", Southampton's \"Due South Magazine\" and \"The List\" which covers Edinburgh and Glasgow. Only the latter is still publishing.\n\nThe \"Bristol Evening Post\" ceased its Saturday edition in April 2012. A month later on 25 May 2012, \"The Post\" launched a new 64-page lifestyle magazine, \"The Weekend\" (subsequently shortened to \"Weekend\"), a supplement included with its Friday edition. This carried many listings, reviews and entertainment articles derived from the Venue website and was justifiably straplined \"powered by Venue\". From issue #43 of \"The Weekend\" (15 March 2013), the strapline was quietly dropped. \"The Weekend\" magazine was relaunched with issue #252 (31 March 2017) as a larger-format publication, but still carrying many of the original \"Venue\"-style listings.\n\nHowever, the distinctive \"Venue\" logo continued to be seen in printed format each Wednesday in a section of three or four pages in that day's Bristol edition of the free Metro (British newspaper), the section being headed \"WHAT'S ON - The week ahead with \"Venue\"\". The \"Venue\" name still continued also on periodic publications such as \"Venue Festival Guide '13\" and \"Eating Out West 2013/14\", the latter title reflecting the title of the magazine's own predecessor.\n\nThe \"Venue\" website, one of the longest-running commercial websites in the UK, was originally set up in 1995. Since the demise of the printed \"Venue\" magazine, the website continues to include event listings, music, theatre and comedy reviews, selected features from the Bristol Post's Weekend supplement, several of the annual guides and includes a popular free personal advertisements section.\n\n\"Venue\" Magazine Final Post.\n\nThe \"Venue\" website was closed by Local World at 11am on Friday 29 November 2013. Venue writers and photographers etc. published an open letter on the site which subsequently went viral and was picked up by Buzzfeed.\n"}
{"id": "18468675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18468675", "title": "WoWWiki", "text": "WoWWiki\n\nWoWWiki is a wiki about the \"Warcraft\" fictional universe, and one of the largest wikis about a specific subject. It began as an independent project in 2004, and in 2007 joined Wikia. In late 2010, most of the administrators that were unhappy with Wikia-mandated changes started an independent fork known as Wowpedia.\n\nWoWWiki.com was launched on November 24, 2004, the day after the release of \"World of Warcraft\" (WoW), as a source of information pertaining to \"WoW\" and the interface modification suite Cosmos. The wiki later expanded to cover the entirety of the Warcraft universe, including RTS games, novels, RPG reference books, manga, and other written sources, along with the \"WoW\" expansion packs. At various points in its development history, it was described as the \"best known MMO wiki\", \"the second largest English-language wiki in the world behind Wikipedia\", and the \"mother of all WoW informational sources.\"\n\nOn May 2, 2007, it was announced that WoWWiki would be moving to Wikia, a for-profit wiki-hosting company. In September 2009, WoWWiki was noted as Wikia's largest wiki at that time.\n\nOn November 1, 2010, in an interview with the \"Toronto Star\", Jimmy Wales described sites in entertainment and gaming as the most popular part of Wikia, stating that \"in gaming, every major video game has a huge wiki about it. World of Warcraft is probably the biggest. ... Just for that particular wiki alone, I think we see 4 to 5 million people a month.\"\n\nIn March 2008, SXSW held a panel on \"How Gamers are Adopting the Wiki Way\", which heavily featured WoWWiki and focused on the wiki as a collaborative strategy space for players. In a 2009 article, Lee Sherlock argued that WoWWiki constituted a collaborative writing genre, distinct from forums and walkthroughs (e.g. GameFAQs). Rik Hunter treated WoWWiki as a fan \"affinity space\". Both Sherlock and Hunter argued that WoWWiki was a primary example of a broader trend in digital media where consumers and users became producers of information. More recently, Hunter has analyzed talk pages for patterns of collaboration and suggests that \"Successful collaborative writing on WoWWiki is a result of writers sharing common 'habits of mind,' and collaboration can be disrupted by those who hold more author-centric perspectives of textual ownership.\" In a follow up article, Hunter further analyzed talk pages to \"describe a model of writing that accounts for \"readers-as-writers\".\" Faltin Karlsen saw WoWWiki's size and complexity as evidence for the scale of emergent complexity in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like \"World of Warcraft\".\n\nIn late 2010, Wikia introduced a new fixed-width skin, which caused layout issues with many articles and broke JavaScript-based features such as tooltips as well as generating reports of eye strain and headaches. The dispute with Wikia led some of the WoWWiki community to seek a different host. As a result, the content and article edit history was forked by duplicating the WoWWiki database on 20 October 2010. Most of the administrators of WoWWiki, as well as the other active contributors, moved to a new site called Wowpedia, which was announced shortly thereafter.\n\n\n"}
