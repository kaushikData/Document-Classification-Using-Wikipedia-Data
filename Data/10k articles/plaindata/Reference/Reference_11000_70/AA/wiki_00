However, Shi'ite scholars and some Sunni scholars interpret many Quranic verses as referring to Ali. Shi'ite scholars also believe other Imams have been referred in the Quran. They believe Imams are referred to as \"the signs of Allah, the way, the straight path, the light of Allah, the inheritors of the Book, the people of knowledge, the holders of authority and other such designations,\" Shi'ite sources state, Muhammad al-Baqir answers: \"Allah revealed Salat to his Prophet but never said of three or four Rakats, revealed Zakat but did not mention to its details, revealed Hajj but did not count its Tawaf and the Prophet interpreted their details. Allah revealed this verse and Prophet said this verse is about Ali, Hasan, Husayn and the other Twelve Imams.\" Shi'ite scholars, thus, have argued that a quarter of Qur'anic verses are stating the station of imams. Such a view is rejected by Sunni scholars, who argue that some of these verses instead refer to the Quraysh or Muhammad's wives.\n\nIn the year 10 AH (631/32 CE), a Christian envoy from Najran (now in southwestern Saudi Arabia) came to Muhammad to debate doctrines regarding ‘Īsā (, Jesus). After Muhammad likened Jesus' miraculous birth to the creation of Ādam (, Adam),—who was born to neither a mother nor a father — and when the Christians did not accept the Islamic doctrine about Jesus, Muhammad was instructed to call them to Mubahalah where each party should ask God to destroy the false party and their families Sunni historians, except Tabari who do not name the participants, mention Muhammad, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn, and some agree with the Shi'ite tradition that Ali was also among the participants in this event on the side of Muhammad. Accordingly, in the verse of Mubahalah it is argued that the phrase \"our sons\" is representative of Hasan and Husayn, \"our women\" would refer to Fatimah, and that \"ourselves\" would be Muhammad and Ali.\n\nIn the Shi'ite version of the Farewell Sermon, immediately after Muhammad had finished his sermon at Ghadir Khumm, the following verse of the Quran was revealed:\n\nThis day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion (5:3).\n\nShi'ite scholars, along with Sunni ones such as Tabari, Al-Suyuti and Razi, recorded that one day, when Ali was performing the ritual prayers in the Mosque, a beggar began to ask for alms. Ali extended his finger, and the beggar removed his ring. Then Muhammad observed this, and a passage of the Qur'an was sent down upon him (5:55), According to Shi'ites, in this verse, \"obedience is absolute and conjoined with obedience to God and his messenger\", so the person identified as \"Wali\" must be infallible.\n\nAbu Dhar al-Ghifari, one of the earliest converts to Islam, was said to have related the following hadith to Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tha'labi, the Sunni author of the \"Tafsir al-Thalabi\":\nOne day, I was praying with the Prophet in the mosque when a beggar walked in. No one responded to his pleas. The beggar raised his hands towards the heavens and said, \"Allah! Be a witness that I came to the Prophet's Mosque and no one gave me anything.\" Imam Ali (a) was bowing during his prayer at that time. He pointed his little finger, on which was a ring, towards the beggar who came forward and took away the ring. The incident occurred in the Prophet's presence, and he raised his face towards heaven and prayed:\"O Lord! my brother Musa had begged of Thee to open his breast and to make his work easy for him, to loosen the knot of his tongue so that people might understand him, and to appoint from among his relations his brother, as his \"wali\", and to strengthen his back with Harun and to make Harun his partner in his work. O Allah! Thou said to Musa, 'We will strengthen thy arm with thy brother. No one will now have access to either of you!' O Allah! I am Muhammad and Thou hast given me distinction. Open my breast for me, make my work easy for me, and from my family appoint my brother Ali as my \"wali\". Strengthen my back with him.\"\n\nThis verse urges the Prophet of Islam to announce Ali as his successor on his way from his last pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nShi'ite commentators, along with some Sunni ones, record that the \"people of the house\" in this verse are the Ahl al-Kisā’ (, People of the Mantle): Muhammad, Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn.\nAccording to Wilferd Madelung, \"the great majority of the reports quoted by al-Tabari in his commentary on this verse support this interpretation.\" However, Ibn Kathir, in his tafsir of the verse, says \"the [Sunni] scholars are unanimously agreed that they (Muhammad's wives) were the reason for revelation in this case ... but others may be included by way of generalization.\"\n\nShi'ite commentators and Sunni ones like Baydawi and Razi agree that the near relatives in question are Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husayn. Such a view is rejected by Ibn Kathir, who claims the verse refers to the Quraysh, quoting hadiths from Sahih Bukhari and Ahmad ibn Hanbal. According to Madelung Shi'ite and Sunni sources agree that by the near relatives in this verse and other similar verses were meant the descendants of Muhammad's great-grandfather Hashim ibn ‘Abd Manaf, and of Hashim's brother al-Muttalib.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "894820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=894820", "title": "Balkan sprachbund", "text": "Balkan sprachbund\n\nThe Balkan sprachbund or Balkan language area is the ensemble of areal features—similarities in grammar, syntax, vocabulary and phonology—among the languages of the Balkans. Several features are found across these languages though not all need apply to every single language. The languages in question may be wholly unrelated, belonging to various branches of Indo-European (such as Slavic, Greek, Romance, Albanian and Indo-Aryan) or even outside of Indo-European (such as Turkish). Some of the languages use these features for their standard language (i.e. those whose homeland lies almost entirely within the region) whilst other populations to whom the land is not a cultural pivot (as they have wider communities outside of it) may still adopt the features for their local register.\n\nWhile they may share little vocabulary, their grammars have very extensive similarities; for example they have similar case and verb conjugation systems and have all become more analytic, although to differing degrees.\n\nThe earliest scholar to notice the similarities between Balkan languages belonging to different families was the Slovenian scholar Jernej Kopitar in 1829. August Schleicher (1850) more explicitly developed the concept of areal relationships as opposed to genetic ones, and Franc Miklošič (1861) studied the relationships of Balkan Slavic and Romance more extensively.\n\nNikolai Trubetzkoy (1923), Kristian Sandfeld-Jensen (1926), and Gustav Weigand (1925, 1928) developed the theory in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Romanian linguist Alexandru Graur criticized the notion of “Balkan linguistics,” saying that one can talk about “relationships of borrowings, of influences, but not about Balkan linguistics”.\n\nThe term \"Balkan language area\" was coined by the Romanian linguist Alexandru Rosetti in 1958, when he claimed that the shared features conferred the Balkan languages a special similarity. Theodor Capidan went further, claiming that the structure of Balkan languages could be reduced to a standard language. Many of the earliest reports on this theory were in German, hence the term \"Balkansprachbund\" is often used as well.\n\nThe languages that share these similarities belong to five distinct branches of the Indo-European languages:\n\nThe Finnish linguist Jouko Lindstedt computed in 2000 a \"Balkanization factor\" which gives each Balkan language a score proportional with the number of features shared in the Balkan language area. The results were:\n\nAnother language that may have been influenced by the Balkan language union is the Judaeo-Spanish variant that used to be spoken by Sephardi Jews living in the Balkans. The grammatical features shared (especially regarding the tense system) were most likely borrowed from Greek.\n\nThe source of these features as well as the directions have long been debated, and various theories were suggested.\n\nSince most of these features cannot be found in languages related to those that belong to the language area (such as other Slavic or Romance languages), early researchers, including Kopitar, believed they must have been inherited from the Paleo-Balkan languages (e.g. Illyrian, Thracian and Dacian) which formed the substrate for modern Balkan languages. But since very little is known about Paleo-Balkan languages, it cannot be determined whether the features were present. The strongest candidate for a shared Paleo-Balkan feature is the postposed article. The Albanian language originates from one of these languages or possibly a mix of them.\n\nAnother theory, advanced by Kristian Sandfeld in 1930, was that these features were an entirely Greek influence, under the presumption that since Greece \"always had a superior civilization compared to its neighbours\", Greek could not have borrowed its linguistic features from them. However, no ancient dialects of Greek possessed Balkanisms, so that the features shared with other regional languages appear to be post-classical innovations. Also, Greek appears to be only peripheral to the Balkan language area, lacking some important features, such as the postposed article. Nevertheless, several of the features that Greek does share with the other languages (loss of dative, replacement of infinitive by subjunctive constructions, object clitics, formation of future with auxiliary verb \"to want\") probably originated in Medieval Greek and spread to the other languages through Byzantine influence.\n\nThe Roman Empire ruled all the Balkans, and local variation of Latin may have left its mark on all languages there, which were later the substrate to Slavic newcomers. This was proposed by Georg Solta. The weak point of this theory is that other Romance languages have few of the features, and there is no proof that the Balkan Romans were isolated for enough time to develop them. An argument for this would be the structural borrowings or \"linguistic calques\" into Macedonian from Aromanian, which could be explained by Aromanian being a substrate of Macedonian, but this still does not explain the origin of these innovations in Aromanian. The analytic perfect with the auxiliary verb \"to have\" (which some Balkan languages share with Western European languages), is the only feature whose origin can fairly safely be traced to Latin.\n\nThe most commonly accepted theory, advanced by Polish scholar Zbigniew Gołąb, is that the innovations came from different sources and the languages influenced each other: some features can be traced from Latin, Slavic, or Greek languages, whereas others, particularly features that are shared only by Romanian, Albanian, Macedonian and Bulgarian, could be explained by the substratum kept after Romanization (in the case of Romanian) or Slavicization (in the case of Bulgarian). Albanian was influenced by both Latin and Slavic, but it kept many of its original characteristics.\n\nSeveral arguments favour this theory. First, throughout the turbulent history of the Balkans, many groups of people moved to another place, inhabited by people of another ethnicity. These small groups were usually assimilated quickly and sometimes left marks in the new language they acquired. Second, the use of more than one language was common in the Balkans before the modern age, and a drift in one language would quickly spread to other languages. Third, the dialects that have the most \"balkanisms\" are those in regions where people had contact with people of many other languages.\n\nThe number of cases is reduced, several cases being replaced with prepositions, the only exception being Serbo-Croatian. In Bulgarian and Macedonian, on the other hand, this development has actually led to the loss of all cases except the vocative.\n\nA common case system of a Balkan language is:\n\n\nIn the Balkan languages, the genitive and dative cases (or corresponding prepositional constructions) undergo syncretism.\n\n\"Example:\"\nNote: In Romanian this is an exception, and it only applies when referring to individual countries, e.g. ', ', etc. The rule is that \"into\" translates as ”'” when trying to express destination, e.g. ', ', ', \"\", etc but even in this case the same preposition is used to express direction and location.\n\nThe future tense is formed in an analytic way using an auxiliary verb or particle with the meaning \"will, want\", referred to as de-volitive, similar to the way the future is formed in English. This feature is present to varying degrees in each language. Decategoralization is less advanced in fossilized literary Romanian ' and in Serbo-Croatian ', where the future marker is still an inflected auxiliary. In modern Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian, Aromanian, and spoken Romanian, decategoralization and erosion have given rise to an uninflected tense form, where the frozen third-person singular of the verb has turned into an invariable particle followed by the main verb inflected for person (compare Rom 1.sg. ', 2.sg. ', 3.sg. ' > invariable ' > mod. '). Certain Torlakian dialects also have an invariant future tense marker in the form of the proclitic third-person-singular present form of the verb 'to want': ' () 'I will see', ' () \"you will see\", ' () 'he/she/it will see'.\nThe analytic perfect tense is formed in the Balkan languages with the verb \"to have\" and, usually, a past passive participle, similarly to the construction found in Germanic and other Romance languages: e.g. Romanian ' \"I have promised\", Albanian ' \"I have promised\". A somewhat less typical case of this is Greek, where the verb \"to have\" is followed by the so-called ('invariant form', historically the aorist infinitive): . However, a completely different construction is used in Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian, which have inherited from Common Slavic an analytic perfect formed with the verb \"to be\" and the past \"active\" participle: , ' (Bul.) / , ' (Ser.) - \"I have promised\" (lit. \"I am having-promised\"). On the other hand, Macedonian, the third Slavic language in the sprachbund, is like Romanian and Albanian in that it uses quite typical Balkan constructions consisting of the verb \"to have\" and a past passive participle (, \"\" = \"I have promised\"). Macedonian also has a perfect formed with the verb \"to be\", like Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian.\n\nThe so-called renarrative mood is another shared feature of the Balkan languages, including Turkish. It is used for statements that are not based on direct observation or common knowledge, but repeat what was reported by others. For example, Патот бил затворен in Macedonian means \"The road was closed (or so I heard)\". A speaker who uses the indicative mood instead and states \"Патот беше затворен\" implies thereby that they personally witnessed the road's closure.\n\nThe use of the infinitive (common in other languages related to some of the Balkan languages, such as Romance and Slavic) is generally replaced with subjunctive constructions, following early Greek innovation.\n\n\nFor example, \"I want to write\" in several Balkan languages:\n\nBut here is an example of a relict form, preserved in Bulgarian:\nSentences that include only a subjunctive construction can be used to express a wish, a mild command, an intention, or a suggestion.\n\nThis example translates in the Balkan languages the phrase \"You should go!\", using the subjunctive constructions.\n\nWith the exception of Greek, Serbo-Croatian, and Romani, all languages in the union have their definite article attached to the end of the noun, instead of before it. None of the related languages (like other Romance languages or Slavic languages) share this feature, with the notable exception of the northern Russian dialects, and it is thought to be an innovation created and spread in the Balkans.\n\nHowever, each language created its own internal articles, so the Romanian articles are related to the articles (and demonstrative pronouns) in Italian, French, etc., whereas the Bulgarian articles are related to demonstrative pronouns in other Slavic languages.\nThe Slavic way of composing the numbers between 10 and 20, e.g. \"one + on + ten\" for eleven, called superessive, is widespread. Greek does not follow this.\n\nDirect and indirect objects are cross-referenced, or doubled, in the verb phrase by a clitic (weak) pronoun, agreeing with the object in gender, number, and case or case function. This can be found in Romanian, Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Albanian. In Albanian and Macedonian, this feature shows fully grammaticalized structures and is obligatory with indirect objects and to some extent with definite direct objects; in Bulgarian, however, it is optional and therefore based on discourse. In Greek, the construction contrasts with the clitic-less construction and marks the cross-referenced object as a topic. Southwest Macedonia appears to be the location of innovation.\n\nFor example, \"I see George\" in Balkan languages:\nNote: The neutral case in normal (SVO) word order is without a clitic: \"Гледам Георги.\" However, the form with an additional clitic pronoun is also perfectly normal and can be used for emphasis: \"Гледам го Георги.\" And the clitic is obligatory in the case of a topicalized object (with OVS-word order), which serves also as the common colloquial equivalent of a passive construction. \"Георги го гледам.\"\n\nThe replacement of synthetic adjectival comparative forms with analytic ones by means of preposed markers is common. These markers are:\n\nMacedonian and Modern Greek have retained some of the earlier synthetic forms. In Bulgarian and Macedonian these have become proper adjectives in their own right without the possibility of [further] comparison. This is more evident in Macedonian: \"виш\" = \"higher, superior\", \"ниж\" = \"lower, inferior\". Compare with similar structures in Bulgarian: \"висш(-(ия(т))/а(та)/о(то)/и(те))\" = \"(the) higher, (the) superior\" (\"по-висш(-(ия(т))/а(та)/о(то)/и(те))\" = \"(the) [more] higher, (the) [more] superior\"; 'най-висш(-(ия(т))/о(то)/а(та)/и(те))' = \"(the) ([most]) highest, supreme\"; \"нисш\" (also spelled as \"низш\" sometimes) = \"low, lower, inferior\", it can also possess further comparative or superlative as with 'висш' above.\n\nAlso, some common suffixes can be found in the language area, such as the diminutive suffix of the Slavic languages (Srb. Bul. Mac.) \"-ovo\" \"-ica\" that can be found in Albanian, Greek and Romanian.\n\nSeveral hundred words are common to the Balkan union languages; the origin of most of them is either Greek, Bulgarian or Turkish, as the Byzantine Empire, the First Bulgarian Empire, the Second Bulgarian Empire and later the Ottoman Empire directly controlled the territory throughout most of its history, strongly influencing its culture and economics.\n\nAlbanian, Aromanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Romanian, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian also share a large number of words of various origins:\n\nApart from the direct loans, there are also many calques that were passed from one Balkan language to another, most of them between Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Greek, Aromanian and Romanian.\n\nFor example, the word \"ripen\" (as in fruit) is constructed in Albanian, Romanian and (rarely) in Greek (\"piqem\", \"a (se) coace\", ψήνομαι), in Turkish \"pişmek\" by a derivation from the word \"to bake\" (\"pjek\", \"a coace\", ψήνω).\n\nAnother example is the wish \"(∅/to/for) many years\":\n\nIdiomatic expressions for \"whether one <verb> or not\" are formed as \"<verb>-not-<verb>\". \"Whether one wants or not\":\n\nThis is also present in other Slavic languages, eg. Polish \"chcąc nie chcąc\".\n\nThe main phonological features consist of:\n\nThis feature also occurs in Greek, but it is lacking in some of the other Balkan languages; the central vowel is found in Romanian, Bulgarian, some dialects of Albanian, and Serbo-Croatian, but not in Greek or Standard Macedonian.\n\nLess widespread features are confined largely to either Romanian or Albanian, or both:\n\n\n"}

The Survey was intended to record details of the manners, customs and physical features of Indian castes and tribes using in part the anthropometric methods that had first been used in India by Herbert Hope Risley for his own survey of the tribes and castes of Bengal. An eight-year period of funding was allotted for the purpose.\n\nThe British government in India appointed a Superintendent of Ethnography for each province. Thurston, who had been Superintendent of the Madras Government Museum since 1885, had already conducted some ethnographic work in his studies of the hill tribes of Nilgiris District, published in 1894, and elsewhere. He was appointed Superintendent for Madras Presidency, while L. K. Ananthakrishna Iyer and N.

The reports for the two princely states were later integrated with Thurston's work to form the \"Castes and Tribes of Southern India\", as were the results of Thurston's earlier researches into the hill tribes.

Some believed that Thurston had been sent on a mission to kill them in order then to display their stuffed bodies in the Madras museum, while others considered his measuring to be a prelude to their recruitment into the army or to kidnap them, and yet others thought that the equipment used to measure their height was a gallows.

Written for the wife of a landholder in Lincolnshire and Hampshire, it is the oldest known history chronicle in the French language. Scholars have proposed various dates for the chronicle's writing; the middle to late 1130s is commonly accepted. Largely based upon, or directly translated from, pre-existing chronicles, the \"Estoire des Engleis\" documents English history from the 495 landing of Cerdic of Wessex to the death of William II in 1100. The original chronicle opened with England's mythical Trojan beginnings, but all portions which document the period before Cerdic have been lost.\n\nGeffrei Gaimar wrote the \"Estoire des Engleis\" for Constance, the wife of Ralf FitzGilbert. FitzGilbert, who, according to Gaimar in the chronicle's epilogue, commissioned its writing, possessed land in Lincolnshire and Hampshire. Gaimar himself may have been FitzGilbert's chaplain, or perhaps a secular clerk. Scholars have varying opinions concerning the date of the chronicle's writing, with commonly accepted ranges including March 1136 – April 1137 and 1135–1140. Gaimar possibly started the chronicle's composition in Hampshire and completed it in Lincolnshire.\n\nIan Short, an Emeritus Professor of French at Birkbeck, University of London, stated that the chronicle was written \"to provide a vast panorama of the Celto-British, Anglo-Saxon, and Anglo-Norman dynasties in the British Isles from Trojan times until the death of William Rufus.\" It is the oldest known history chronicle written in the French language. The chronicle was written with a Norman bias, stating that the Normans were the true successors to the English throne. As mentioned in the chronicle's epilogue, it opened with England's mythical Trojan beginnings when it was first written. However, this first portion of the chronicle, known as the \"Estoire des Troiiens\", along with another early part named the \"Estoire des Bretuns\", has been lost. The present-day copy begins with the 495 landing of Cerdic of Wessex in England, and ends with William II's death in 1100. The chronicle was written in couplets, containing 6,532 octosyllables. Four manuscripts of the \"Estoire des Engleis\" currently exist. The title \"Estoire des Engleis\" derives from the British Library version.\n\nThe \"Estoire des Engleis\" is based upon pre-existing chronicles. For instance, the now lost portions of the chronicle, the \"Estoire des Troiiens\" and \"Estoire des Bretuns\", likely used information from the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", which was written by Geoffrey of Monmouth.

The group is known for committing several human rights abuses, including an eight-month period of 1991–92 that saw a total of 34 people killed in the Barrios Altos massacre, the Santa massacre, and the La Cantuta massacre.\n\nIn 1980, Peruvian Maoist Abimael Guzman launched a guerrilla war with his group Shining Path. This war, as well as a war launched by the leftist group known as the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement continued into the 1990s, when Alberto Fujimori was elected president. It was then that suspected guerrillas and civilians began dying at the hands of Grupo Colina.\n\nThe Grupo Colina, believed to be mandated by Fujimori, victimized trade unions and activists that spoke out against the Peruvian government, by intimidation or sometimes murder.\n\nWhen the Democratic Constitutional Congress investigated the La Cantuta massacre, Nicolás Hermoza Ríos, Commander General of the Armed Forces, put tanks on the streets and declared that he would not tolerate the Congress insulting the armed forces. The Congress largely backed down.\n\nLater, some members of Grupo Colina were put on trial. Fujimori signed a controversial law that granted amnesty to anyone accused of, tried for, convicted of, or sentenced for human rights violations that were committed by the armed forces or police. When a court found this law unconstitutional, Fujimori signed a new law removing the right of judicial review over amnesty laws. This second law was known as the \"Barrios Altos Law\" because it ensured that those members of Grupo Colina who committed the Barrios Altos massacre would be freed. Eventually, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights struck down both amnesty laws.\n\nSince the collapse of the Fujimori government, several people have been tried for Grupo Colina's crimes, including Fujimori himself, who was tried and convicted for the La Cantuta massacre and the Barrios Altos massacre. Testimony in defense of Fujimori has been offered by group leaders, Jesús Sosa Saavedra and Santiago Martin Rivas, who claim that Fujimori was an unwitting participant in the Grupo Colina's actions. Other trials have established that Grupo Colina was not an informal group of renegade officers but an organic part of the Peruvian state. Julio Salazar, former \"de jure\" chief of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), was sentenced to thirty-five years of prison for his role in the La Cantuta massacre. During Salazar's tenure at the SIN, Vladimiro Montesinos was the \"de facto\" SIN chief and national security advisor. Montesinos is currently imprisoned in the Callao Military Prison outside of Lima and faces over seventy trials for various human rights abuses, as well as charges of arms trafficking, drug trafficking, and political corruption. The operational chief of Grupo Colina, Santiago Martín Rivas, is also imprisoned.\n\n\n"}

Between 2006 and 2008 it was funded by a European Union research project of the same name that grouped together industrial and academic actors to develop various Semantic Desktop technologies.\n\nThree active implementations of NEPOMUK exist: A C++/KDE-based variant, a Java-based variant, and a commercial version. More versions were created during the EU project between 2006 and 2008, some active beyond the project.\n\n\"NEPOMUK-KDE\" was originally featured as one of the newer technologies in KDE Software Compilation 4. It used Soprano as the main RDF data storage and parsing library, while handling ontology imports through the Raptor parser plugin and the Redland storage plugin; all RDF data was stored by Virtuoso which also handled full-text indexing. On a technical level, NEPOMUK-KDE allowed associating metadata to various items present on a normal user's desktop such as files, bookmarks, e-mails, and calendar entries. Metadata could be arbitrary RDF. Tagging is the most user-visible metadata application.\n\nAs the KDE SC 4 series of releases progressed, it became apparent that NEPOMUK was not delivering the performance and user experience that had initially been anticipated. As a result of this, in KDE SC 4.13 a new indexing and semantic search technology \"Baloo\" was introduced, with a short transition period allowing applications to be ported and data to be migrated before the removal of NEPOMUK.\nBaloo initially used SQLite but currently uses LMDB\nfor storage, and Xapian for searching.\n\nThe Zeitgeist framework, used by GNOME and Ubuntu's Unity user interface, uses the NEPOMUK ontology, as does the Tracker search engine.\n\nThe Java-based implementation of NEPOMUK was finished at the end of 2008 and served as a proof-of-concept environment for several novel semantic desktop techniques. It features its own frontend (\"PSEW\") that integrates search, browsing, recommendation, and peer-to-peer functionality. The Java implementation uses the Sesame RDF store and the Aperture framework for integrating with other desktop applications such as mail clients and browsers.\n\nA number of artifacts have been created in the context of the Java research implementation:\n\nImplementation of the commercial Software as a service product \"Refinder\" started in 2009 and a limited beta-version was released in December 2010. \"Refinder\" was developed by Gnowsis, a spin-off company of the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) (project lead in the NEPOMUK EU project). The start-up was shut down in late 2013, with no plans to make the implementation code available.\n\n\"Refinder\" uses the same data formats as the other implementations, but using Software as a service instead of the desktop approach of the other implementations.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25464184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25464184", "title": "ORCID", "text": "ORCID\n\nThe ORCID iD (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is a nonproprietary alphanumeric code to uniquely identify scientific and other academic authors and contributors. This addresses the problem that a particular author's contributions to the scientific literature or publications in the humanities can be hard to recognize as most personal names are not unique, they can change (such as with marriage), have cultural differences in name order, contain inconsistent use of first-name abbreviations and employ different writing systems. It provides a persistent identity for humans, similar to that created for content-related entities on digital networks by digital object identifiers (DOIs).\n\nThe ORCID organization, ORCID Inc., offers an open and independent registry intended to be the \"de facto\" standard for contributor identification in research and academic publishing. On 16 October 2012, ORCID launched its registry services and started issuing user identifiers.\n\nORCID was first announced in 2009 as a collaborative effort by the research community \"to resolve the author name ambiguity problem in scholarly communication\". The \"Open Researcher Contributor Identification Initiative\" - hence the name ORCID - was created temporarily prior to incorporation. \n\nA prototype was developed on software adapted from that used by Thomson Reuters for its ResearcherID system. ORCID, Inc., was incorporated as an independent nonprofit organization incorporated in August 2010 in Delaware, United States of America, with an international board of directors. Its executive Director, Laure Haak, was appointed in April 2012. From 2016, the board is chaired by Veronique Kiermer of PLOS (the former chair was Ed Pentz of Crossref). ORCID is freely usable and interoperable with other ID systems. ORCID launched its registry services and started issuing user identifiers on 16 October 2012. Formally, ORCID iDs are specified as URIs, for example, the ORCID iD for John Wilbanks is <nowiki>https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4510-0385</nowiki> (both https:// and http:// forms are supported; the former became canonical in November 2017). However, some publishers use the short form, e.g. \"ORCID: 0000-0002-4510-0385\" (as a URN).\n\nORCID iDs are a subset of the International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI), under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization (as ISO 27729), and the two organizations are cooperating. ISNI will uniquely identify contributors to books, television programmes, and newspapers, and has reserved a block of identifiers for use by ORCID, in the range 0000-0001-5000-0007 to 0000-0003-5000-0001. It is therefore possible for a person to legitimately have both an ISNI and an ORCID iD – effectively, two ISNIs.\n\nBoth ORCID and ISNI use 16-character identifiers, using the digits 0–9, and separated into groups of four by hyphens. The final character, which may also be a letter \"X\" representing the value \"10\" (for example, Nick Jennings' ORCID iD is <nowiki>https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0166-248X</nowiki>, Stephen Hawking's is <nowiki>https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9079-593X</nowiki>) is a MOD 11-2 check digit conforming to the ISO/IEC 7064:2003 standard.\n\nAn ORCID account for a fictitious person, Josiah Carberry, exists as <nowiki>https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097</nowiki>, for use in testing and as an example in documentation and training material.\n\nThe aim of ORCID is to aid \"the transition from science to e-Science, wherein scholarly publications can be mined to spot links and ideas hidden in the ever-growing volume of scholarly literature\". Another suggested use is to provide each researcher with \"a constantly updated ‘digital curriculum vitae’ providing a picture of his or her contributions to science going far beyond the simple publication list\". The idea is that other organizations will use the open-access ORCID database to build their own services.\n\nIt has been noted in an editorial in \"Nature\" that ORCID, in addition to tagging the contributions that scientists make to papers, \"could also be assigned to data sets they helped to generate, comments on their colleagues’ blog posts or unpublished draft papers, edits of Wikipedia entries and much else besides\".\n\nIn April 2014, ORCID announced plans to work with the Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information to record and acknowledge contributions to peer review.\n\nIn an open letter dated 1 January 2016 eight publishers, including the Royal Society, the American Geophysical Union, Hindawi, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, PLOS, and Science, committed to requiring all authors in their journals to have an ORCID iD.\n\nBy the end of 2013 ORCID had 111 member organizations and over 460,000 registrants. On 15 November 2014, ORCID announced the one-millionth registration. , the number of registered accounts reported by ORCID was 5,641,303. The organizational members include many research institutions such as Caltech and Cornell University, and publishers such as Elsevier, Springer, Wiley and Nature Publishing Group. There are also commercial companies including Thomson Reuters, academic societies and funding bodies.\n\nGrant-making bodies such as the Wellcome Trust (a charitable foundation) have also begun to mandate that applicants for funding provide an ORCID identifier.\n\nIn several countries, consortia, including government bodies as partners, are operating at a national level to implement ORCID. For example, in Italy, seventy universities and four research centres are collaborating under the auspices of the (CRUI) and the National Agency for the Evaluation of the University and Research Institutes (ANVUR), in a project implemented by Cineca, a not-for-profit consortium representing the universities, research institutions, and the Ministry of Education. In Australia, the government's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and Australian Research Council (ARC) \"encourage all researchers applying for funding to have an ORCID identifier\". The French scientific article repository HAL is also inviting its users to enter their ORCID number.\n\nIn addition to members and sponsors, journals, publishers, and other services have included ORCID in their workflows or databases. For example, the \"Journal of Neuroscience\", Springer Publishing, the Hindawi Publishing Corporation, Europe PMC, the Japanese National Institute of Informatics's Researcher Name Resolver, Wikipedia, and Wikidata.\n\nSome online services have created tools for exporting data to, or importing data from, ORCID. These include Scopus, Figshare, Thomson Reuters' ResearcherID system, Researchfish, the British Library (for their EThOS thesis catalogue), ProQuest (for their ProQuest Dissertations and Theses service), and Frontiers Loop.\n\nIn October 2015, DataCite, Crossref and ORCID announced that the former organisations would update ORCID records, \"when an ORCID identifier is found in newly registered DOI names\".\n\nThird-party tools allow the migration of content from other services into ORCID, for example Mendeley2ORCID, for Mendeley.\n\nSome ORCID data may also be retrieved as RDF/XML, RDF Turtle, XML or JSON. ORCID uses GitHub as its code repository.\n\n\n"}

Begun in 1933, it was published in fascicles between 1968 and 1982; a lightly revised second edition was released in 2012.\n\nThe dictionary was created in order to meet the need for a more modern Latin-English dictionary than Lewis & Short's \"Latin Dictionary\", while being less ambitious in scope than the unfinished \"Thesaurus Linguae Latinae\". It was based on a new reading of classical sources, based on the advances in lexicography in creating the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\nAlthough Lewis and Short's \"Latin Dictionary\" was widely used in the English world by the end of the nineteenth century, its faults were widely felt among classicists. While Oxford University Press had attempted the creation of a new Latin dictionary as early as 1875, these projects failed. The OLD was spurred by the submission of a report in 1924 by Alexander Souter on the deficiencies of Lewis and Short; he eventually became the dictionary's first editor. The compilation of the more than one million quotations on which the work was based began in 1933. After Souter's retirement in 1939, Cyril Bailey and J.M. Wyllie were appointed co-editors. From 1949, Wyllie was the sole editor, and he was replaced, following tensions among the editorial staff, in 1954 by P.G.W. Glare, who remained in the position until the completion of the lexicon. The dictionary was originally published in eight fascicles at two-yearly intervals from 1968 until 1982. The complete dictionary contains c. 40,000 entries (covering 100,000 senses). It was generally well received by classicists.\n\nOther members of the editorial staff included C.O. Brink (1938–42), E.A. Parker (1939–46), M. Alford (1942–45), J. Chadwick (1946–52), B.V. Slater (1947–49), D.C. Browning (1949–50), W.M. Edwards (1950–69), J.D. Craig (1952–53), C.L. Howard (1952–58), G.E. Turton (1954–70), R.H. Barrow (1954–82), S. Trenkner (1955–57), R.C. Palmer (1957–82), G.M. Lee (1968–82), and D. Raven (1969–70).\n\nIn 2012, a second edition of the dictionary was published in two volumes (the binding of the 1982 single-volume edition has a tendency to fall apart under the paper's weight), removes some English translations now considered to be archaic, and presents the material in a clearer fashion using the Arno typeface.\n\nAlthough the OLD was intended as a replacement for Lewis and Short’s dictionary from 1879, its lack of information about Latin writings from after AD 200 has drawn criticism from its users. Lewis and Short's coverage of late and ecclesiastical Latin (if inconsistent), combined with the fact that this dictionary is freely available online, has meant that it has remained in continuous use.\n\nThe \"Thesaurus Linguae Latinae\" is far more ambitious than the OLD, but after more than 100 years only two thirds of this comprehensive dictionary has been published.\n\n\n"}

It survives as a single complete copy of a 12th-century woodblock printed book that was discovered in the Tangut city of Kharakhoto. In addition, a single page from a different copy of the same edition of the \"Pearl in the Palm\" was found at the Northern Mogao Caves in 1989. The book transcribes the pronunciation of Chinese words into Tangut characters, and the pronunciation of Tangut characters into Chinese characters, and so is a very important source for Tangut historical phonology, and was the primary source before the publication of monolingual Tangut dictionaries.\n\nIn 1909, the Russian explorer Pyotr Kozlov unearthed a number of texts and artefacts in Ejin Banner, Inner Mongolia, including the \"Pearl in the Palm\" and transported them back to St. Petersburg, Russia. There, Aleksei Ivanovich Ivanov, professor at Saint Petersburg State University, who was aware of its value, added them to his collection. It is now in the collection of the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg.\n\nIn 1912, Chinese scholars Luo Zhenyu and Feng Ge visited Ivanov upon learning about the work in his possession, and were given access to nine pages, which they photocopied for study. In 1922 Luo Zhenyu met Ivanov again, in Tianjin. It was only then he would only have access to the full text, then ordered his son to make a full copy.\n\nThe Belgian scholar Luc Kwanten visit to the Soviet Union in the late 1970s, and was able to photograph the whole of \"The Pearl in the Palm\". In 1982, the book finally saw the light of day when the photographed version was published in the United States.\n\nThe original book consists of 37 xylograph folios in concertina format. The preface is identical content written in both Chinese and Tangut. From the sentence \"How can you mix with foreigners without learning foreign words, How can you be counted amongst the Han without learning Han words\" (不學番言，則豈和番人之眾；不會漢語，則豈入漢人之數) it is clear that the book aimed to facilitate the Tanguts and the Chinese to learn each other's languages.\n\nThe book contains words 414 CPC, according to three powers are divided into nine categories: celestial bodies, celestial images, sky changes, terrestrial bodies, terrestrial images, terrestrial use, human body, human phase, human matters. One category is the most extensive content: personnel issues accounts for half of all the content.\n\nEach entry contains four elements: from right to left, Tangut phonetics in Chinese, Tangut script, Chinese script, and Chinese phonetics in Tangut. The book is important in understanding and interpretation of the now dead Tangut language.\n"}

The barn situated next to the house was built as a working demonstration in 2001.\n\nFrench Canadian lumberjacks probably built the Settlers’ Cabin in East Charlotte, Vermont in about 1800. Constructed of hand-hewn and dovetailed beech and pine timbers, Settlers’ Cabin is typical of the type of structure that Vermont settlers, loggers, and trappers often built as temporary homes.\n\nWhen the Shelburne Museum acquired the structure in 1955, clapboard (architecture) facing obscured the log structure beneath. After moving the building’s exterior walls to the grounds intact, the Museum provided a new foundation, replaced the roof, and restored the cabin’s single interior room, stone fireplace, and sleeping loft. The structure, in combination with the adjacent hay barn, which the Museum constructed in 2001, now houses the Museum’s only living exhibition that reveals how early Vermont settlers lived.\n\nIn 1959 the Museum constructed the sawmill adjacent to Settlers’ Cabin. In colonial America wood was needed to construct everything from sailing ships to storage kegs and lumber, forested by loggers like the French Canadians who built Settlers’ Cabin, quickly emerged as the most important cash crop of 18th-century America. The Museum’s Sawmill illustrates how this cash crop was prepared for market.\n\nSwiftly moving water can create energy powerful enough to run machinery. While in operation, the water’s motion forced the sawmill’s saw blade up and down, enabling it to cut through logs directed into its path. At full speed, the saw cut two strokes per second, which allowed a sawyer to cut a ten-foot board in eight minutes.\n\nHistorically the term “sawmill” referred both to the mill building and to the machinery it contained. Shelburne’s Sawmill was built to house equipment from a South Royalton, Vermont sawmill that was operated by Jeremiah Trescott and his partner Captain Stevens from the late 18th century. The Shepard family, descendants of Trescott, continued to operate the mill until the early 20th century and later donated its contents to the Museum.\n\n\n"}

The oldest section of the cottage dates to 1671, with additions in the mid-18th century. It is constructed of stone and timberframe components. The house was originally located at the intersection of New Dorp Lane and Cedar Grove Avenue in the New Dorp Beach section of Staten Island, but was moved to its current location in 1967 when it was threatened with demolition.\n\nThe earliest section of the house was built to serve court and government functions. One of its earliest known inhabitants was town clerk and justice of the peace Obadiah Holmes, the son of early Rhode Island settler Obadiah Holmes, who came from Long Island. In 1679, he transferred ownership of the property to his son Obadiah. Nathaniel Britton, an ancestor of the man for whom the cottage is named, acquired the house in 1695. Isaac Cubberly bought the house in 1761 and the house remained in his family for eighty-six years. Dr. Nathaniel Lord Britton, a botanist and the creator of the New York Botanical Garden, became the owner of the house in the 19th century and deeded the house to the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences in 1915. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57753333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57753333", "title": "The Cambridge Shakespeare", "text": "The Cambridge Shakespeare\n\nThe Cambridge Shakespeare is a long-running series of critical editions of William Shakespeare's works published by Cambridge University Press. The name encompasses three distinct series: \"The Cambridge Shakespeare\" (1863–1866), \"The New Shakespeare\" (1921–1969), and \"The New Cambridge Shakespeare\" (1984–).\n\n\"The Cambridge Shakespeare\" was edited by William George Clark and William Aldis Wright and released in nine volumes between 1863 and 1866. Clark and Wright used the \"First Folio\" (1623) as their base text and collated it with the second, third, and fourth folios as well as all the known quarto editions. The edition modernized the orthography to 19th-century standards rather than preserve the variable Elizabethan spelling, but generally left the grammar and metre unchanged.\n\nIn the edition, each page of a play contains a critical apparatus at the end. Where the folio text differs markedly from the quarto editions the quarto text is included in small type after the main text. Notes on variants, emendations, or pointing out or clarifying passages of particular difficulty or interest are placed at the end of each play.\n\nIn what a modern editor called \"a bold move for a Victorian edition\", Clark and Wright restored various original phrases that had previousøly been considered profane, where needed to preserve metre or meaning.\n\nIn 2009, Cambridge University Press reissued all nine volumes as part of their \"Cambridge Library Collection\" which aims to preserve access to \"books of enduring scholarly value\". The reissued editions are:\n\"The New Shakespeare\" was published between 1921 and 1969. The series was edited by Arthur Quiller-Couch and J. Dover Wilson.\n\nThe earlier volumes of the series contain critical introductions by Quiller-Couch (signed \"Q\") and written in a \"belles lettres\" style that, according to R. A. Foakes in \"The Oxford Handbook to Shakespeare\" (2003), have been \"largely forgotten\". The textual work by Wilson, however, \"proved enormously influential.\"\n\nIn the 1921 edition of \"The Tempest\", Wilson included a facsimile of the manuscript for \"Sir Thomas More\" and a full discussion of the copy for the texts, which afterward became required reading in the field. Shakespeare's hand in the manuscript for \"Sir Thomas More\" was discovered by Edward Maunde Thompson in \"Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study\" (1916)—and treated in detail in what is still the definitive study: \"Shakespeare's Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More\" (1923) by Alfred W. Pollard, W. W. Greg, R. W. Chambers and Wilson—but \"The New Shakespeare\" was the first series of editions to bring this discovery to bear on editing Shakespeare. The series was also the first to apply Pollard's recognition of the primacy of the quartos to textual work.\n\nThe last volume of the series was \"Henry VIII\", edited by J. C. Maxwell in 1969.\n\n\"The New Cambridge Shakespeare\" began in 1984, and several editions were published each year, so that today, all of Shakespeare's plays and poems are available in the series. The series was designed to replace \"The New Shakespeare\" series.\n\nThe New Cambridge editions feature lengthy introductions and copious annotation. They are distinctive in appearance, being taller in shape than most of their competitors. The earliest editions featured cyan covers with an illustration by C. Walter Hodges of the relevant play in performance on an Elizabethan stage. In the 1990s, these covers were replaced with a new uniform blue design featuring a multicoloured sketch of Shakespeare's face based on a drawing by David Hockney. In the 2000s, the series was reissued again with each play receiving a specific photographic image (in colour).\n\nThe earliest editions in the series feature drawings by C. Walter Hodges that reconstruct the appearance of the plays when first produced in the Elizabethan theatre; this practice continued until Hodges' death in 2004.\n\nNotable editions published in the series include the first ever edition of the disputed play \"Edward III\" to be published as Shakespeare's as part of a series; and a controversial edition of \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\" that rejects the conventional thesis that the play was poorly printed and the result of collaborative authorship.\n\nThe series also uniquely produces fully edited modern-spelling editions of quarto texts when they differ significantly from the standard received text of the play. These include editions of the first quarto of \"Hamlet\", the first quarto of \"Henry V\", quarto \"King Lear\", the \"Richard III\", the quarto of \"Othello\", the first quarto of \"Romeo and Juliet\", and \"The Taming of a Shrew\", an alternate version of \"The Taming of the Shrew\".\n\nThe general editors of the series are Philip Brockbank (1984-1990) and Brian Gibbons (1990-present), with individual editors, or pairs of, assigned to cover separate plays and poetry.\n\n"}

The collections are huge and include materials in three public repositories. Of the material now in public ownership or curation the largest element is The Forsythe Collection in the National Railway Museum at York's Search Engine Archive. The central theme of their collecting is the ephemera of travel and transport. A thought that is especially driven by the recognised concept of \"grey literature\" (printed materials with no bibliographical trace).\n\nThe Forsythe Collection (in a conscious manner) may well date back to the early 20th century. James Forsythe (1916-2004) the father of Robert Forsythe (1959-) had a cousin Colin McFarlane. Colin avidly took up the Edwardian craze of collecting postcards (in his case of railways). James Forsythe as he grew up travelling the British Empire was introduced to stamp collecting. Both those historic collections remain part of the Forsythe Collection. When Robert Forsythe grew up in the Norfolk of the 1960s, his father was deeply involved in maritime heritage notably as Chairman of the Norfolk Wherry Trust caring for the Wherry Albion. James Forsythe had boated on the Norfolk Broads since his childhood. Maps and transport literature surrounded Robert. At school Robert Forsythe started to collect railway timetables in 1971 and the earliest letters establishing this collection survive at the Norfolk Record Office.\n\nIn time Robert Forsythe became a museum curator, and met and married a librarian Fiona Forsythe. They built up a network of contributors and established what the railway world realised was a very special collection. Meanwhile as house moves forced decisions other elements of the family collections found public repositories. These embrace the Papers of Major James A. Forsythe, MBE (1916-2004), in the Norfolk Record Office and the Cambridge University Centre of South Asian Studies.\n\nThe transfer to the National Railway Museum at York took place in January 2009 and again in January 2012. Some 100 metres of shelved material were transferred. The essence of the transfer was the grey literature elements of the Forsythe Collection of Transport and Travel ephemera as it is described at York. This means the publicity materials: timetables, leaflets, handbills and brochures but in general not ISBN covered items nor \"books\" including guidebooks. Posters, tickets and postcards were also not transferred and these collections remain with the Forsythes. Nor were extensive model railway interests. Subsequently materials were used in the first APP generated at the museum. Another selective mention is of the material used in The Track Stars Exhibition in 2012.\n\n"}

Of course, Umvolkung in the first sense was seen as a negative process during the Third Reich, while the second process was seen as desirable.\n\nThe term was invented by Albert Brackmann, a leader of the Ostforschung, which was a research organization that investigated the character and the attitudes of people (the so-called \"Verhalten\") living in areas east of the German Reich, e.g. in Poland, Ukraine, Slovakia and Romania. \n\nThere was a plan to conquer almost whole Eastern Europe and process the \"Umvolkung\", so all the former German people, who had slowly assimilated and mixed with the other ethnicities, would become more German again.\n\nThe term became a catchphrase and is often used to describe German fears of \"Überfremdung\" by immigrants or their descendants whose numbers have been constantly increasing since the foundation of the German Federal Republic.\n\n\n"}
