Part of the \"1001 Before You Die\" series, it compiles writings and information on albums chosen by a panel of music critics to be the most important, influential, and best in popular music between the 1950s and the 2010s. The book was edited by Robert Dimery, an English writer and editor who had previously worked for magazines such as \"Time Out\" and \"Vogue\".\n\nEach entry in the book's list of albums is accompanied by a short essay written by a music critic, along with pictures, quotes, and additional information (such as the album's running time and producer). Only albums consisting fully of original material by a particular artist were included, which meant that compilations by various artists, including most film soundtracks, were also excluded.\n\nThe most recent edition consists of a list of albums released between 1955 and 2017, part of a series from Quintessence Editions Ltd. The book is arranged roughly chronologically, starting with Frank Sinatra's \"In the Wee Small Hours\" and the most recent edition concluding with \"I See You\" by The xx.\n\nIn the book's introduction, general editor Robert Dimery notes that the selections were also intended to bring attention to gifted songwriters. Joni Mitchell, Elvis Costello and Nick Cave are named as examples. The release dates are chosen from the date the album first released in the artist's home country, and the version is the first one released, which would affect The Beatles' album tally. In most cases, bonus tracks added for later versions are ignored. The editors also attempted to ensure that each album profiled was still available for purchase. Soundtracks that were not original material from a particular artist were also excluded.\n\nIn February 2006, \"Publishers Weekly\" called the book a \"bookshelf-busting testament to music geeks' mania for lists\" and said it was \"about as comprehensive a 'best-of' as any sane person could want\". The reviewer added: \"For music lovers, it doesn't get much better.\" The 2006 edition had an average rating of 3.92 stars out of 5 on Amazon.com's social cataloging website Goodreads, with 860 ratings as of April 30, 2015. The same 2006 version has an average rating of 3.5 stars out of 5 on Amazon.com.\n\nMost of the book's recommendations are rock and pop albums from the Western world. \"1001 Albums\" also features selections from world music, rhythm and blues, blues, folk, hip hop, country, electronic music, and jazz. The rock and pop albums include such subgenres as punk rock, grindcore, heavy metal, alternative rock, progressive rock, easy listening, thrash metal, grunge and rockabilly. Classical and modern art music are excluded.\n\nThese artists have the most albums in the 2017 edition.\n\n\n"}

Concurrent with his studies, he started his career in 1949 at the ORTF (National French Radio) producing a show for a young audience. In 1957, he was a political columnist for the daily newspaper \"La Liberté du Massif Central\", and an editor for \"Paris-Presse\". In 1958, he joined the weekly magazine \"Jours de France\". He was appointed in 1960 director of information of the Republic of Niger where he created the information services and the daily \"Le Temps du Niger\". In 1962, he founded and directed for five years the daily \"Le Courrier de Madagascar\" in Antananarivo. He created in 1967 in Martinique the weekly \"France Antilles Spécial Dimanche\". He was in 1968 in Dakar, Senegal, leading the creation of the daily \"Le Soleil\" and of \"Les Nouvelles Imprimeries du Sénégal\", both of which paved the way to the plurality and opening of information in French West Africa. Gayot has been active in Canada where he renewed and relaunched the world's oldest French language daily, \"L'Evangéline\". He brought his expertise to the local press in Vietnam, Egypt, Mauretania, Zaïre (now Republic of Congo), Burundi and Iran.\n\nIn 1969, with his friends Henri Gault and Christian Millau, he founded the monthly magazine \"Le Nouveau Guide\", which went against culinary traditions of the time by promoting artistically prepared food, new cooking techniques and fresh ingredients. The three also founded the \"Gault Millau\" guide, and coined and promoted the term \"nouvelle cuisine\". In the 1980s and 1990s, Gayot began publishing in the USA a series of restaurant guidebooks known alternatively under the Gault-Millau name or as \"Gayot Guides\". The guidebooks rated and highlighted restaurants deemed to be among the top in their region, with reviews discussing décor, service, ambience and wine lists, with an emphasis on French cuisine. After 2000, his guides were published exclusively under the name Gayot, following a disagreement with the new owners of the French Gault-Millau guides.\n\nIn 1983, Gayot founded, in Paris, the monthly magazine \"Prévention Santé\" in conjunction with Rodale Publishing (Emmaus, PA USA). With son Alain and daughter Sophie, he launched in Los Angeles the website www.gayot.com devoted to gastronomy, tourism and lifestyle.\n\nOn May 7, 1979, Léopold Sédar Senghor, President of the Republic of Senegal presented Gayot, in his name and that of the President of the French Republic Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in the presence of Michel Debré former French prime minister, with the distinction of Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur, for his humanitarian and cultural actions for Africa.\n\n\"For exceptional services rendered to the freedom of press and promotion of the friendship between nations\" was said on April 27, 2005, by the Ambassador of France in Washington, D.C., Jean-David Levitte as he bestowed on Gayot the award of the rank of Officer of the Legion of Honor, – the highest French distinction. Gayot is also an officer in the national order of Senegal (order of the Lion), in the national order of the République du Niger and in the order of the Comoros.

He is researcher of the CNRS and president of the Société de mythologie française.\n\nHe has written a seminal work on Greek mythology entitled \"Homosexuality in Greek Myth\", translated into English two years later by Beacon Press. In 1986, he followed up with a study covering early homosexuality in Europe, under the title of \"L'homosexualité initiatique dans l'Europe ancienne\" (Payot 1986), which has yet to be translated into English. The two studies have been published together, with a postface, as \"Homosexualité et initiation chez les peuples indo-européens\".\n\nIn \"Genèse de L'Inde\", he attacks the recent anti-invasionist reconstructions of early Indian history. Instead he defends the traditional hypothesis that the Indo-Aryans invaded India in the 2nd millennium BC. According to Sergent, the Dravidian populations are not autochthonous either, but of African origin.\n\nThe book \"Les Indo-Européens - Histoire, langues, mythes\" is a general introduction to the Indo-European language family. Sergent associates the Indo-European language family with certain archaeological cultures in Southern Russia, and he reconstructs an Indo-European religion (relying on the method of Georges Dumézil). He writes that the lithic assemblage of the first Kurgan culture in Ukraine (Sredni Stog II), originated from the Volga and South Urals, recalls that of the Mesolithic-Neolithic sites to the east of the Caspian sea, Dam Dam Chesme II and the cave of Djebel. Thus, he places the roots of the Gimbutas' Kurgan cradle of Indo-Europeans in a more southern cradle, and adds that the Djebel material is related to a Paleolithic material of Northwestern Iran, the Zarzian culture, dated 10,000-8,500 BC, and in the more ancient Kebarian of the Near East. He concludes that more than 10,000 years ago the Indo-Europeans were a small people grammatically, phonetically and lexically close to Semitic-Hamitic populations of the Near East.\n\nIn the monograph, \"Les trois fonctions indo-européennes en Grèce ancienne\", vol. 1: \"De Mycènes aux Tragique\", Sergent examines the employment of the Dumézilian tripartite system in Greek epic, lyric and dramatic poetry. In a second volume, which has not been published yet, he will continue this examination with Greek philosophy and religion.\n\nHis recent work, \"Celtes et Grecs\", is dedicated to comparative Greek and Celtic mythology. In volume 1, \"Le livre de héros\" (Payot 1999 ), the Irish hero Cuchulainn is compared with the Greek heroes Achilleus, Bellerophon and Melanthius and the Irish epic Táin Bó Cúailnge with the Greek Iliad, which, according to Sergent, presuppose an Indo-European \"pre-Iliad\". In volume 2, \"Le livre des dieux\", Sergent argues that the Celtic and Greek pantheons derive from a common Indo-European inheritance.\n\n\n\n"}

Weld, a resident of Brookline, Massachusetts and a scion of the Welds of that area, practiced surgery for many years, but ultimately gave it up to manage his family's fortune. He made major contributions to two museums in Greater Boston:\n\nWeld is well known for his purchase and donation of the collection of Ernest Fenollosa for the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The museum is now home to one of the finest and largest collections of Japanese art outside Japan, numbering over 100,000 objects.\n\nIn 1886, Weld attempted to sail around the world in his personal yacht. However, while moored in Yokohama, the yacht caught fire and was destroyed. As a result, Weld spent an extended amount of time with his Bostonian friends William Sturgis Bigelow and Ernest Fenollosa. The pair had already been in Japan for some time themselves, exploring the country and collecting art.\n\nThe Fenollosa-Weld Collection contains many of the most famous pieces in the Museum of Fine Arts' collection. Among them is a handscroll painting (\"emaki\") depicting the 1159 Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace. Others are famous pieces by Sesshū, Kanō Eitoku, and Kanō Hōgai.\n\nWhile Fenollosa and Bigelow developed very widespread and inclusive tastes in art during their time in Japan, Weld's interests remained somewhat narrowly focused. His primary interests in life were sport, boating, and martial activities such as archery. As a result, he became one of the first Americans to collect Japanese swords, spears, and other martial implements as art. In addition to full swords, Weld purchased many sword ornaments, handguards (\"tsuba\"), and other sword fittings such as \"kozuka\", tiny blades tied to a swordhilt and used by the samurai for basic utilitarian tasks.\n\nIn 1911, the collections of Ernest Fenollosa and Charles G. Weld, much of it already physically in the Museum of Fine Arts, on loan indefinitely, became the property of the Museum, as the Fenollosa-Weld Collection.\n\nWeld also made major contributions to the Peabody Essex Museum. Included among these are 110 photographs that premier American photographer Edward S. Curtis made for his 1905-1906 exhibit. Clark Worswick, curator of photography for the museum, describes them as:\n\n\"...Curtis' most carefully selected prints of what was then his life’s work...certainly these are some of the most glorious prints ever made in the history of the photographic medium.

{"id": "439040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439040", "title": "Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union", "text": "Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\n\nThe Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union enshrines certain political, social, and economic rights for European Union (EU) citizens and residents into EU law. It was drafted by the European Convention and solemnly proclaimed on 7 December 2000 by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission. However, its then legal status was uncertain and it did not have full legal effect until the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009.\n\nUnder the Charter, the European Union must act and legislate consistently with the Charter and the EU's courts will strike down legislation adopted by the EU's institutions that contravenes it. The Charter applies to the Institutions of the European Union and its member states when implementing European Union law.\n\nThe Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (Treaty of Rome) did not include any reference to fundamental or human rights. The EEC Treaty was written a few years after the failure of the European Defence Community Treaty and the European Political Community Treaty. The latter treaty had included rights provisions and Craig and de Búrca argue that, in light of that failure, the drafters of the EEC Treaty wished to eschew any implicitly political elements. However, the idea that the purely economic end of the new EEC Treaty would be unlikely to have any implications for fundamental rights was soon to be tested.\n\nSoon after the entry into force of the EEC Treaty, the Community established itself as a major political entity with policy ramifications beyond its economic aims. In 1964, the European Court of Justice handed down its decision in \"Costa v ENEL\", in which the Court decided that Union law should take precedence over conflicting national law. This meant that national governments could not escape what they had agreed to at a European level by enacting conflicting domestic measures, but it also potentially meant that the EEC legislator could legislate unhindered by the restrictions imposed by fundamental rights provisions enshrined in the constitutions of member states. This issue came to a head in 1970 in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case when a German court ruled that a piece of EEC legislation infringed the German Basic Law. On a reference from the German court, the ECJ ruled that whilst the application of Union law could not depend on its consistency with national constitutions, fundamental rights did form an \"integral part of the general principles of [European Community] law\" and that inconsistency with fundamental rights could form the basis of a successful challenge to a European law.\n\nIn ruling as it did in \"Internationale Handelsgesellschaft\" the ECJ had in effect created a doctrine of unwritten rights which bound the Community institutions. While the court's fundamental rights jurisprudence was approved by the institutions in 1977 and a statement to that effect was inserted into the Maastricht Treaty it was only in 1999 that the European Council formally went about the initiating the process of drafting a codified catalogue of fundamental rights for the EU.\n\nIn 1999 the European Council proposed that a \"body composed of representatives of the Heads of State and Government and of the President of the Commission as well as of members of the European Parliament and national parliaments\" should be formed to draft a fundamental rights charter. On being constituted in December of that year the \"body\" entitled itself the European Convention.\n\nThe Convention adopted the draft on 2 October 2000 and it was solemnly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission on 7 December 2000. It was at the same time, however, decided to defer making a decision on the Charter's legal status. However, it did come with the political weight of having been approved by three powerful institutions and as such was regularly cited by the ECJ as a source of fundamental rights.\n\nA modified Charter formed part of the defunct European Constitution (2004). After that treaty's failure, its replacement, the Lisbon Treaty (2007), also gave force to the Charter albeit by referencing it as an independent document rather than by incorporating it into the treaty itself. However, both the version included in the Constitution and the one referenced in the Lisbon Treaty were amended versions of the Charter.\n\nOn the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding proposed that Commissioners should swear to uphold all EU treaties and the Charter. On 3 May 2010, the European Commission swore a solemn declaration at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the EU Treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate. For the first time, the Commissioners also explicitly pledged to respect the new Charter of Fundamental Rights.\n\nSeveral states insisted upon an opt-out from national application of the charter (see below for details).\n\nFollowing the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 the fundamental rights charter has the same legal value as the European Union treaties. The Charter referred to in the Treaty is an amended version of the 2000 document which was solemnly declared by the same three institutions a day before the signing of the Lisbon Treaty itself.\n\nArticle 51(1) of the Charter addresses the Charter to the EU's institutions, bodies established under EU law and, when implementing EU laws, the EU's member states. In addition both Article 6 of the amended Treaty of European Union and Article 51(2) of the Charter itself restrict the Charter from extending the competences of the EU. A consequence of this is that the EU will not be able to legislate to vindicate a right set out in the Charter unless the power to do such is set out in the Treaties proper. Furthermore, individuals will not be able to take a member state to court for failing to uphold the rights in the Charter unless the member state in question was implementing EU law. It is this last point that has been subject to the most debate.\n\nThe Charter is not the first attempt to place human rights principles at the core of European Union law. All EU member states are, and candidate states are required to be, signatories to the Council of Europe's European Convention on Human Rights, so that many principles from the Convention, such as the right to a fair trial, were taken as the baseline for European Court of Justice jurisprudence even before their formal reiteration in Charter. In interpreting the human rights protections provided by the general principles of EU law (described in the Court cases section above), the ECJ had already dealt with the issue of whether the rights protected by those general principles applied to member states. Having ruled in \"Johnston v Royal Ulster Constabulary\" that a right to fair procedures was one of the general principles of EU law, in \"Kremzow v Austria\" the ECJ had to decide whether or not a member state was obliged to apply that principle in relation to a wrongful conviction for murder. Kremzow's lawyers argued that his case came within the scope of EU law on the grounds that his wrongful conviction and sentence had breached his right to free movement within the EU. The ECJ responded by saying that since the laws under which Kremzow had been convicted were not enacted to secure compliance with EU law, his predicament fell outside the scope of EU law.\n\nThe wording in \"Kremzow v Austria\", referring to the \"field of application of EU law\", differs from the wording in the Charter which refers to the implementation of EU law. However, the amended explanatory memorandum issued alongside the Charter in 2007 describes the wording used in the Charter as reflecting ECJ precedent.\n\nIn the negotiations leading up to the signing to the Lisbon Treaty, Poland and the United Kingdom secured a protocol to the treaty relating to the application of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights in their respective countries.\n\nThe protocol, in article 1(1) states that the \"Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or actions of Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms.\" Article 1(2) then says that the Title IV of the Charter, which contains economic and social rights, does not create justiciable rights, unless Poland and the UK have provided for such rights in their national laws.\n\nBoth countries to which the protocol currently applies had different reasons for negotiating the protocol. The United Kingdom originally opposed a legally binding charter over concerns that it would result in a stream of British citizens going to the European Court of Justice in attempts to enforce their Charter rights in the UK, and in increased costs for business. While the British accepted a legally binding rights charter during the negotiations of the failed European Constitution, they negotiated a protocol during the Lisbon negotiations which, according to the then British Minister for Europe, would ensure that the Charter would not extend the powers of the European Court of Justice over United Kingdom law.\n\nAlthough their problems with the Charter related to its perceived liberal stance on social issues, in September 2007 the Polish government indicated that they wished to be included in the British protocol.\n\nThere is considerable debate concerning the legal effect of the protocol. One view, shared by Jan Jirásek, is that the protocol is an opt-out that excludes the application of the Charter to Poland and the United Kingdom. Another, shared by Ingolf Pernice, is that the protocol is only an interpretative protocol which will either have limited or no legal consequence. Craig and de Burcá argue that the protocol is merely declaratory. It says that the \"Charter does not extend the ability\" of the ECJ or other court to overturn UK or Polish law, but the ECJ already had the power to do this in any case. Accordingly, the Protocol is \"unlikely that it will have any significant effect in practice.\"\n\nIn \"NS v Home Secretary\", the ECJ ruled that Article 1(1) of the protocol \"explains Article 51 of the Charter with regard to the scope thereof and does not intend to exempt the Republic of Poland or the United Kingdom from the obligation to comply with the provisions of the Charter or to prevent a court of one of those Member States from ensuring compliance with those provisions.\"\n\nUnder Clause 5(4) of the Great Repeal Bill, the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not be retained in UK law after its exit from the EU. Campaign groups such as Liberty and Amnesty International have stated this is inconsistent with the Great Repeal Bill's aim of legal certainty and the Government's promise of retaining all EU law on the date of withdrawal.\n\nDuring the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Czech President Václav Klaus expressed concern that the Charter would allow families of Germans who were expelled from territory in modern-day Czech Republic after the Second World War to challenge the expulsion before the EU's courts, though legal experts have suggested that the laws under which the German were expelled, the Beneš decrees, did not fall under the jurisdiction of EU law. After Klaus refused to finalize the Czech Republic's ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon unless the country was excluded from the Charter, as Poland and the United Kingdom had been, EU leaders agreed in October 2009 to amend the protocol to include the Czech Republic at the time of the next accession treaty in a measure designed to persuade Klaus to sign the treaty. He subsequently signed the treaty.\n\nIn September 2011, the Czech government formally submitted a request to the Council that the promised treaty revisions be made to extend the protocol to the Czech Republic, and a draft amendment to this effect was proposed by the European Council. However, the Czech Senate passed a resolution in October 2011 opposing their accession to the protocol. When Croatia's Treaty of Accession 2011 was signed in late 2011, the Czech protocol amendment was not included. During the Czech Republic's parliamentary ratification of the accession treaty in the spring of 2012, the government attempted to combine the approval of the Charter opt-out with the ratification bill. However, with the Senate controlled by the opposition parties, their objections to the opt-out could have led to the accession treaty being rejected. As a result, the government decided to separate the proposed opt-out from the accession treaty bill.\n\nA vote on a draft report by the European Parliament Constitutional Affairs Committee in January 2012 recommending against granting the Czech Republic's request to be added to Protocol 30 resulted in a tie. The report argued that Protocol 30 was not functioning as a general opt-out from the Charter, but only allowed the countries to limit the application of subsequent EU laws based solely on the charter. Thus, the Czech Republic would still be bound by the Charter even if they were added to the Protocol. In October 2012, the committee approved the report, and a third draft of the report was published on 11 December 2012. The report was tabled in Parliament during its session on 22 May 2013, and the Parliament voted in favour of calling on the European Council \"not to examine the proposed amendment of the Treaties\". The Parliament did, however, give its consent in advance that a treaty revision to add the Czech Republic to Protocol 30 would not require a new convention.\n\nIn January 2014, after presidential and parliamentary elections the previous year had resulted in new leadership in the country, new Czech Human Rights Minister Jiří Dienstbier said that he would attempt to have his country's request for an opt-out withdrawn. This was confirmed on 20 February 2014 by the new Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, who withdrew the request for an opt-out during a meeting with President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso shortly after his newly elected government won the confidence of Parliament. In May 2014, the Council of the European Union formally withdrew their recommendation to hold a Intergovernmental Conference of member states to consider the proposed amendments to the treaties.\n\nThe Charter contains some 54 articles divided into seven titles. The first six titles deal with substantive rights under the headings: dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens' rights and justice, while the last title deals with the interpretation and application of the Charter. Much of Charter is based on the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), European Social Charter, the case-law of the European Court of Justice and pre-existing provisions of European Union law.\n\n\nThe EU has attempted to raise the profile of the Charter so that citizens are more aware of their rights. For example, the EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) has produced apps for iOS and Android with the text of the Charter in all EU languages and related information. It has also published mini-versions of the Charter in all EU languages.\n\nIn 2010, the FRA put out a tender for poets to turn the Charter into an 80-minute-long epic poem, with music, dance and multimedia elements. This was also to raise awareness and to simplify the legal text into more understandable language. However, Viviane Reding, the European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom & Security, wrote to the director of the FRA slamming the idea on cost and dignity grounds and instructing him to cancel the project.\n\n\n\n"}

In effect, it was a Victorian version of today's Yellow Pages. Many reference libraries still keep their copies of these directories, which are now an important source for historical research.\n\nThe eponymous originator of the directory was Frederic Festus Kelly.

It is addressed to Humfrey Martyn, the son of Sir Roger Martyn, a master of the Mercers' Company. \n\nThe authorship of the letter was ascribed to Robert Langham (c. 1535–1579/80), a mercer and keeper of the privy council chamber, based on the author's references to himself in the letter as \"Lanham\" or \"Laneham\", \"Langham\", \"Ro. La.\", and \"R. L. Gent. Mercer\", and other biographical details, such as his self-description as a \"Merchauntaventurer, and Clark of the Councell chamber doore\", for which office he writes that he obtained through the patronage of Leicester. Council records confirm that he was paid £10 each April from 1573 to 1579 as keeper of the council chamber.\n\nThe letter's editor, R. J. P. Kuin, argues that it is an authentic account by Langham, but others think it was written by William Patten as a joke at Langham's expense, a view which has been accepted by some authorities. The argument for Patten's authorship is based on similarities of form, style, subject matter, and phraseology common to the letter and Patten's acknowledged work and the close resemblance between his known hand and that which appears in two annotated copies of the letter. In addition, Patten himself witnessed the Kenilworth festivities and contributed some Latin verses to welcome the queen.\n\nThe work was reissued at Warwick in 1784, and was reprinted in John Nichols's \"Progresses of Queen Elizabeth\". Sir Walter Scott quoted from it in his novel \"Kenilworth\" (1821), leading to the republication of the \"Letter\" in London the same year.

The video game is based on the . It was released on May 5, 2009. Ben Stiller reprises his role in the film as the voice of Larry Daley.\n\nGameplay will involve Larry exploring certain exhibits in the museum. Platforming involves Larry using a rope to swing from hooks and a flashlight that activates different contraptions.\nBattling requires Larry to lead his enemies to a certain painting or statue and activating it, causing the object to attack (ex. Thinker will swipe at a passing enemy, an ocean painting releases a shark, etc.) Larry will be able to pilot vehicles, which are the Apollo lunar lander, a Pitcairn Autogyro and Rexy the T-rex.\n\nThe plot of the game is almost the same as the plot of the film.\n\nLarry Daley is the CEO and founder of the company Daley Devices, and learns that the Museum of Natural History, where he once worked as a night guard and found out that the exhibits come to life every night, is having renovations, replacing the wax figures and stuffed animals with state-of-the-art 3D holograms. Larry returns to the museum, where he learns from Jedidiah the miniature cowboy and Octavius the Roman general that because of the renovations, they will be shipped to the Federal Archives (Octavius mistakenly calls it the Imperial Archives) under the Smithsonian Museum, aside from Rexy the T-Rex skeleton, Ahkmenrah and his tablet, (which is the source which makes the exhibits come to life) the Easter Island Head (nicknamed Dumb-dumb), and other signature exhibits will be staying. Larry meets with Ahkmenrah, who teaches him about the several ingots the tablet consists of, explaining that each ingot has a different power. He tells Larry he can use the tablet's powers using his flashlight and key-chain.\n\nAfter returning home, Larry receives a call from Jed, informing him that the tablet was stolen by the cheeky monkey Dexter while all of them were supposed to be in federal archives without the tablet. Larry rushes to the Smithsonian in Washington DC. He steals a key card from a guard and enters the Federal Archive, and gets the tablet. However, night comes (Larry calls it \"magic time\" throughout the video game), causing everything to come to life. This brings the evil Kahmunrah, who is Ahkmenrah's evil brother, to life, imprisoning Jed, Dexter and the others. Larry is threatened by Kahmunrah, and is forced to give him the tablet. Kahmunrah smashes the tablet to pieces (an event that did not happen in the film), giving the ingots in the tablet to several other exhibits who are on his side (such as Napoleon, Ivan the Terrible and Al Capone) who hide the ingots. Larry escapes by releasing a squid, who captures Kahmunrah and his servants, escaping with the tablet with only one ingot left. Larry tracks down the exhibits following Kahmunrah, and finds the ingots in several places in the museum, such as the Art Gallery (where he steals the ingot from Ivan the terrible, fixing the exhibits Ivan damaged on the way), the Air and Space Museum (where he steals an ingot from Napoleon) and so on.\n\nIn the end, there is a huge battle over the finished tablet, which is won by Larry's friends and Larry banishes Kahmunrah to the Underworld. Like the movie, the game ends with the museum being open late at night and Larry telling his boss Dr. McPhee that he stuck motors in the exhibits, while he actually just brought the tablet home, and having the exhibits come back to life.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews in general, with a Metacritic average of 50%.\n\nIGN were the most positive source, saying that the game is: \"Not exhilarating, not mind-blowing, but surprisingly solid. Good job, Pipeworks, you made a game that's educational, simple, and, best of all, never outstays its welcome.\" \"Official Xbox Magazine\" called it: \"A solid choice for couch time with the kids.\" ITReviews acknowledged: \"There are decent moments, but added that the game is ridiculously short, a little too muddled and really quite poor value for money.\" GameSpot also agreed on the longevity issue, saying that: \"A few cute moments can't disguise this movie tie-in's biggest problem: its criminally short length.\"\n\n\n"}

It may reach as much as in length and in weight.\n\nLike the closely related Atlantic bluefin and southern bluefin, the Pacific bluefin is a commercially valuable species and several thousand tonnes are caught each year, making it overfished. It is considered threatened by the IUCN and PEW. Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program have placed all bluefin tunas on the \"Avoid\" list, and they are also placed on the \"Red List\" by Greenpeace and the Blue Ocean Institute.\n\nAccording to stock assessments completed in 2011, 2014 and 2016 by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC), the present-day population is at just 2.6 percent of its historic levels. The overall fishing mortality rate for this species remains up to three times higher than is sustainable.\n\nAlmost all fish are cold-blooded (ectothermic).\n\nHowever, tuna and mackerel sharks are warm-blooded: they can regulate their body temperature. Warm-blooded fish possess organs near their muscles called \"retia mirabilia\" that consist of a series of minute parallel veins and arteries that supply and drain the muscles. As the warmer blood in the veins returns to the gills for fresh oxygen it comes into close contact with cold, newly oxygenated blood in the arteries. The system acts as a counter-current heat exchanger and the heat from the blood in the veins is given up to the colder arterial blood rather than being lost at the gills. The net effect is less heat loss through the gills. Fish from warmer water elevate their temperature a few degrees whereas those from cold water may raise it as much as warmer than the surrounding sea.\n\nThe tuna's ability to maintain body temperature has several definite advantages over other sea life. It need not limit its range according to water temperature, nor is it dominated by climatic changes. The additional heat supplied to the muscles is also advantageous because of the resulting extra power and speed. Bluefin tuna have been clocked in excess of during 10 to 20 second sprints, enabling it to hunt squid, herring, mackerel, etc., that slower predators cannot capture.\n\nThe Pacific bluefin tuna is primarily found in the North Pacific, ranging from the East Asian coast to the western coast of North America. It is mainly a pelagic species found in temperate oceans, but it also ranges into the tropics and more coastal regions. It typically occurs from the surface to , but has been recorded as deep as .\n\nIt spawns in the northwestern Philippine Sea (e.g., off Honshu, Okinawa and Taiwan) and in the Sea of Japan. Some of these migrate to the East Pacific and return to the spawning grounds after a few years. It has been recorded more locally as a visitor to the Southern Hemisphere, including off Australia, New Zealand, Gulf of Papua and French Polynesia.\n\nThe species is considered to consist of only one stock.\n\nPacific bluefin tunas reach maturity at about 5 years of age, the generation length is estimated at 7–9 years and based on two separate sources the longevity is 15 year or 26 years. At maturity it is about long and weighs about . Individuals that are long are regularly seen, and the maximum reported is in length and in weight. Elsewhere, a mass of up to has been reported for the species. According to the International Game Fish Association, the all-tackle game fish record was a individual (Donna Pascoe) caught on 19 February 2014 onboard charter boat Gladiator during the National Tournament.\n\nSpawning occurs from April to August, but the exact timing depends on the region: Early in the northwest Philippine Sea (the southern part of its breeding range) and late in the Sea of Japan (the northern part of its breeding range). Large females can carry more eggs than small ones, and between 5 million and 25 million eggs have been reported.\n\nPacific bluefins eat various small schooling squids and fishes, but have also been recorded taking sessile animals, pelagic red crabs and krill.\n\nUnlike the other bluefins (Atlantic and southern), the Pacific bluefin tuna was not considered threatened initially, resulting in a Least Concern rating in 2011. In 2014, it was found to be threatened and the status was upgraded to Vulnerable. Overfishing is occurring in the Pacific bluefin, but overall the stock was not yet believed to be in an overfished condition in 2011. In 2010, it was estimated that the complete spawning biomass was 40–60% of the historically observed spawning biomass. In 2000–2004, between 16,000 tonnes and 29,000 tonnes were caught per year. Its wide range and migratory behavior leads to some problems, since fisheries in the species are managed by several different Regional Fisheries Management Organisations that sometimes give conflicting advice. The IUCN have recommended that the responsibility is moved to a single organisation. Other recommendations include a substantial reduction of fishing of this species, especially juveniles. As much as 90% of the caught Pacific bluefins are juveniles.\n\nMonterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program have placed all bluefin tunas on the \"Avoid\" list, and they are also placed on the \"Red List\" by both Greenpeace and the Blue Ocean Institute.\n\nPacific bluefin flesh may contain levels of mercury or PCBs that are harmful to humans that consume it. A similar problem exists in other tuna species.\n\nAbout 80% of the Pacific and Atlantic bluefin tunas are consumed in Japan, and tunas that are particular suited for sashimi and sushi can reach very high prices. In Japan, some foods made available for the first time of the year are considered good luck, especially bluefin tuna. Winning these new year auctions is often used as a way to get publicity, which raises the prices considerably higher than their market value: on January 5, 2013, a Pacific bluefin tuna caught off northeastern Japan was sold in the first auction of the year at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo for a record 155.4 million yen (US$1.76 million) – leading to record unit prices of $3,603 per pound, or ¥ 703,167 per kilogram.\n\nJapan is both the biggest consumer and the leader in tuna farming research. Kinki University of Japan first successfully farmed already-hatched bluefin tuna in 1979. In 2002, they succeeded in breeding them, and in 2007, the process was repeated for a third generation. This farm-raised tuna is now known as Kindai tuna. Kindai is a contraction of Kinki University (Kinki daigaku).\n\n"}

{"id": "355753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355753", "title": "Photojournalism", "text": "Photojournalism\n\nPhotojournalism is a particular form of journalism (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, but in some cases the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, street photography or celebrity photography) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. They deliver news in a creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining.\n\n\n\n\nLike a writer, a photojournalist is a reporter, but he or she must often make decisions instantly and carry photographic equipment, often while exposed to significant obstacles (e.g., physical danger, weather, crowds, physical access).\n\nThe practice of illustrating news stories with photographs was made possible by printing and photography innovations that occurred in the mid 19th century. Although early illustrations had appeared in newspapers, such as an illustration of the funeral of Lord Horatio Nelson in \"The Times\" (1806), the first weekly illustrated newspaper was the \"Illustrated London News\", first printed in 1842. The illustrations were printed with the use of engravings.\nThe first photograph to be used in illustration of a newspaper story was a depiction of barricades in Paris during the June Days uprising taken on 25 June 1848; the photo was published as an engraving in L'Illustration of 1-8 July 1848.\nDuring the Crimean War, the \"ILN\" pioneered the birth of early photojournalism by printing pictures of the war that had been taken by Roger Fenton. Fenton was the first official war photographer and his work included documenting the effects of the war on the troops, panoramas of the landscapes where the battles took place, model representations of the action, and portraits of commanders, which laid the groundwork for modern photojournalism. Other photographers of the war included William Simpson and Carol Szathmari. Similarly, the American Civil War photographs of Mathew Brady were engraved before publication in \"Harper's Weekly.\" Disaster, including train wrecks and city fires, was also a popular subject for illustrated newspapers in the early days.\n\nThe printing of images in newspapers remained an isolated occurrence in this period. Photos were used to enhance the text rather than to act as a medium of information in its own right. This began to change with the work of one of the pioneers of photojournalism, John Thomson, in the late 1870s. In collaboration with the radical journalist Adolphe Smith, he began publishing a monthly magazine, \"Street Life in London\", from 1876 to 1877. The project documented in photographs and text, the lives of the street people of London and established social documentary photography as a form of photojournalism. Instead of the images acting as a supplement to the text, he pioneered the use of printed photographs as the predominant medium for the imparting of information, successfully combining photography with the printed word.\n\nOn March 4, 1880, \"The Daily Graphic\" (New York) published the first halftone (rather than engraved) reproduction of a news photograph.\nIn March 1886, when General George Crook received word that the Apache leader Geronimo would negotiate surrender terms, photographer C. S. Fly took his equipment and attached himself to the military column. During the three days of negotiations, Fly took about 15 exposures on glass negatives. His photos of Geronimo and the other free Apaches, taken on March 25 and 26, are the only known photographs taken of American Indians while still at war with the United States. Fly coolly posed his subjects, asking them to move and turn their heads and faces, to improve his composition. The popular publication \"Harper's Weekly\" published six of his images in their April 24, 1886 issue.\n\nIn 1887, flash powder was invented, enabling journalists such as Jacob Riis to photograph informal subjects indoors, which led to the landmark work \"How the Other Half Lives\". By 1897, it became possible to reproduce halftone photographs on printing presses running at full speed.\n\nIn France, agencies such as Rol, Branger and Chusseau-Flaviens (ca. 1880–1910) syndicated photographs from around the world to meet the need for timely new illustration. Despite these innovations, limitations remained, and many of the sensational newspaper and magazine stories in the period from 1897 to 1927 were illustrated with engravings. In 1921, the wirephoto made it possible to transmit pictures almost as quickly as news itself could travel.\n\nThe \"Golden Age of Photojournalism\" is often considered to be roughly the 1930s through the 1950s. It was made possible by the development of the compact commercial 35mm Leica camera in 1925, and the first flash bulbs between 1927 and 1930, which allowed the journalist true flexibility in taking pictures.\n\nA new style of magazine and newspaper appeared that used photography more than text to tell stories. The \"Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung\" was the first to pioneer the format of the illustrated news magazine. Beginning in 1901, it began to print photographs inside the magazine, a revolutionary innovation. In the successive decades, it was developed into the prototype of the modern news magazine.\n\nIt pioneered the photo-essay, had a specialised staff and production unit for pictures and maintained a photo library. It also introduced the use of candid photographs taken with the new smaller cameras.\n\nThe magazine sought out reporters who could tell a story using photographs, notably the pioneer sports photographer Martin Munkácsi, the first staff photographer, and Erich Salomon, one of the founders of photojournalism.\n\nOther magazines included, \"Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung\" (Berlin), \"Vu\" (France), \"Life\" (USA), \"Look\" (USA), \"Picture Post\" (London)); and newspapers, \"The Daily Mirror\" (London) and \"The New York Daily News\". Famous photographers of the era included Robert Capa, Romano Cagnoni, Alfred Eisenstaedt, Margaret Bourke-White and W. Eugene Smith.\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson is held by some to be the father of modern photojournalism, although this appellation has been applied to various other photographers, such as Erich Salomon, whose candid pictures of political figures were novel in the 1930s.\n\nThe photojournalism of, for example, Agustí Centelles played an important role in the propaganda efforts of the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s.\n\nSoldier Tony Vaccaro is also recognized as one of the pre-eminent photographers of World War II. His images taken with the modest Argus C3 captured horrific moments in war, similar to Capa's Spanish soldier being shot. Capa himself was on Omaha Beach on D-Day and captured pivotal images of the conflict on that occasion. Vaccaro is also known for having developed his own images in soldier's helmets, and using chemicals found in the ruins of a camera store in 1944.\n\nUntil the 1980s, most large newspapers were printed with turn-of-the-century \"letterpress\" technology using easily smudged oil-based ink, off-white, low-quality \"newsprint\" paper, and coarse engraving screens. While letterpresses produced legible text, the photoengraving dots that formed pictures often bled or smeared and became fuzzy and indistinct. In this way, even when newspapers used photographs well — a good crop, a respectable size — murky reproduction often left readers re-reading the caption to see what the photo was all about. The \"Wall Street Journal\" adopted stippled hedcuts in 1979 to publish portraits and avoid the limitations of letterpress printing. Not until the 1980s did a majority of newspapers switch to \"offset\" presses that reproduce photos with fidelity on better, whiter paper.\n\nBy contrast \"Life\", one of America's most popular weekly magazines from 1936 through the early 1970s, was filled with photographs reproduced beautifully on oversize 11×14-inch pages, using fine engraving screens, high-quality inks, and glossy paper. \"Life\" often published a United Press International (UPI) or Associated Press (AP) photo that had been first reproduced in newspapers, but the quality magazine version appeared to be a different photo altogether. In large part because their pictures were clear enough to be appreciated, and because their name always appeared with their work, magazine photographers achieved near-celebrity status. \"Life\" became a standard by which the public judged photography, and many of today's photo books celebrate \"photojournalism\" as if it had been the exclusive province of near-celebrity magazine photographers.\n\nIn 1947 a few famous photographers founded the international photographic cooperative Magnum Photos. In 1989 Corbis Corporation and in 1995 Getty Images were founded. These powerful image libraries sell the rights to photographs and other still images.\n\nThe Golden Age of Photojournalism ended in the 1970s when many photo-magazines ceased publication. They found that they could not compete with other media for advertising revenue to sustain their large circulations and high costs. Still, those magazines taught journalism much about the photographic essay and the power of still images.\n\nHowever, since the late 1970s, photojournalism and documentary photography have increasingly been accorded a place in art galleries alongside fine art photography. Luc Delahaye, Manuel Rivera-Ortiz and the members of VII Photo Agency are among many who regularly exhibit in galleries and museums.\n\nThe Danish Union of Press Photographers (Pressefotografforbundet) was the first national organization for newspaper photographers in the world. It was founded in 1912 in Copenhagen, Denmark by six press photographers. Today it has over 800 members.\n\nThe National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) was founded in 1946 in the U.S., and has about 10,000 members. Others around the world include the British Press Photographers Association (BPPA) founded in 1984, then relaunched in 2003, and now has around 450 members. Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (1989), Northern Ireland Press Photographers Association (2000), Pressfotografernas Klubb (Sweden, 1930), and PK — Pressefotografenes Klubb (Norway).\n\nMagnum Photos was founded in 1947 by Robert Capa, David \"Chim\" Seymour, Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger, William Vandivert, Rita Vandivert and Maria Eisner, being one of the first photographic cooperatives, owned and administered entirely by its members worldwide.\n\nVII Photo Agency was founded in September 2001 and got its name from the original seven founders, Alexandra Boulat, Ron Haviv, Gary Knight, Antonin Kratochvil, Christopher Morris, James Nachtwey and John Stanmeyer. Today it has 30 members, along with a mentor program.\n\nNews organizations and journalism schools run many different awards for photojournalists. Since 1968, Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded for the following categories of photojournalism: 'Feature Photography', 'Spot News Photography'. Other awards are World Press Photo, Best of Photojournalism, and Pictures of the Year as well as the UK based The Press Photographer's Year.\n\nPhotojournalism works within the same ethical approaches to objectivity that are applied by other journalists. What to shoot, how to frame and how to edit are constant considerations. Photographing news for an assignment is one of the most ethical problems photographers face. Photojournalists have a moral responsibility to decide what pictures to take, what picture to stage, and what pictures to show the public. For example, photographs of violence and tragedy are prevalent in American journalism because as an understated rule of thumb, that \"if it bleeds, it leads\". The public is attracted to gruesome photographs and dramatic stories. A lot of controversy arises when deciding which photographs are too violent to show the public.\n\nPhotographs of the dead or injured arouse controversy because, more often than not, the name of person depicted in the photograph is not given in the caption. The family of the person is often not informed of the photograph until they see it published. The photograph of the street execution of a suspected Viet Cong soldier during the Vietnam War provoked a lot of interest because it captured the exact moment of death. The family of the victim was also not informed that the picture would run publicly. Being exposed to such violence can have physiological and psychological effects on those who document it and is but one of many different forms of emotional labor that photojournalists report experiencing.\n\nOther issues involving photojournalism include the right to privacy and the compensation of the news subject. Especially regarding pictures of violence, photojournalists face the ethical dilemma of whether or not to publish images of the victims. The victim's right to privacy is sometimes not addressed or the picture is printed without their knowledge or consent. The compensation of the subject is another issue. Subjects often want to be paid in order for the picture to be published, especially if the picture is of a controversial subject.\n\nAnother major issue of photojournalism is photo manipulation – what degree is acceptable?  Some pictures are simply manipulated for color enhancement, whereas others are manipulated to the extent where people are edited in or out of the picture. War photography has always been a genre of photojournalism that is frequently staged. Due to the bulkiness and types of cameras present during past wars in history, it was rare when a photograph could capture a spontaneous news event. Subjects were carefully composed and staged in order to capture better images. Another ethical issue is false or misleading captioning. The 2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies is a notable example of some of these issue, and see photo manipulation: use in journalism for other examples.\n\nThe emergence of digital photography offers whole new realms of opportunity for the manipulation, reproduction, and transmission of images. It has inevitably complicated many of the ethical issues involved.\n\nOften, ethical conflicts can be mitigated or enhanced by the actions of a sub-editor or picture editor, who takes control of the images once they have been delivered to the news organization. The photojournalist often has no control as to how images are ultimately used.\n\nThe National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) is an American professional society that emphasizes photojournalism. Members of the NPPA accept the following code of ethics\n\nMost photojournalists consider stage-managed shots presented as candid to be unethical. There have been examples in the history of photojournalism of photographers purposefully deceiving their audience by doing so.\n\nMike Meadows, a veteran photographer of the Los Angeles Times, was covering a major wild fire sweeping southern California on 27 October 1993. His picture of a Los Angeles County firefighter, Mike Alves cooling himself off with water in a pool in Altadena ran both in the Times and nationally. Prior to submitting the photograph for a Pulitzer Prize, Meadows' assignment editor, Fred Sweets, contacted the firefighter, who reportedly said he had been asked by Meadows to go to the pool and splash water on his head. Meadows denied the accusation, claiming \"I may have been guilty of saying this would make a nice shot, but to the best of my recollection, I did not directly ask him to do that. ... I've been doing breaking news stories for years and years and I've never in my life set up a picture.\" Meadows was suspended without pay for a week and picture was withdrawn from any prize competitions - the Times called it a \"fabrication\" and the paper's photography director, Larry Armstrong, said \"when you manipulate the situation, you manipulate the news.\"\n\nEdward Keating, a Pulitzer Prize winner from The New York Times, photographed a young boy pointing a toy gun outside a Middle Eastern grocery store, near a town where the FBI raided an alleged Al Qaeda cell. Other photographers at the scene claimed that Keating pointed with his own arm to show the boy which way to look and aim the gun. After the Columbia Journalism Review reported the incident, Keating was forced to leave the paper.\n\nAs early as the Crimean War in the mid-19th century, photographers were using the novel technology of the glass plate camera to record images of British soldiers in the field. As a result, they had to deal with not only war conditions, but their pictures often required long shutter speeds, and they had to prepare each plate before taking the shot and develop it immediately after. This led to, for example, Roger Fenton traveling around in a transportable dark room, which at times made him a target of the enemy. These technological barriers are why he was unable to obtain any direct images of the action.\n\nThe use of photography as a way of reporting news did not become widespread until the advent of smaller, more portable cameras that used an enlargeable film negative to record images. The introduction of the 35 mm Leica camera in 1925 made it possible for photographers to move with the action, take multiple shots of events as they were unfolding, as well as be more able to create a narrative through their photographs alone.\n\nSince the 1960s, motor drives, electronic flash, auto-focus, better lenses and other camera enhancements have made picture-taking easier. New digital cameras free photojournalists from the limitation of film roll length. Although the number depends on the amount of megapixels the camera contains, whether one's shooting mode is JPEG or raw, and what size of memory card one is using, it is possible to store thousands of images on a single memory card.\n\nSocial media are playing a big part in revealing world events to a vast audience. Whenever there is a major event in the world, there are usually people with camera phones ready to capture photos and post them on various social networks. Such convenience allows the Associated Press and other companies to reach out to the citizen journalist who holds ownership of the photos and get permission to use those photos in news outlets.\n\nThe content of photos tends to outweigh their quality when it comes to news value. On February 18, 2004, The New York Times published on their front page a photo of AT&T CEO John Zeglis which was taken with a camera phone. Content remains the most important element of photojournalism, but the ability to extend deadlines with rapid gathering and editing of images has brought significant changes. As recently as 15 years ago, nearly 30 minutes were needed to scan and transmit a single color photograph from a remote location to a news office for printing. Now, equipped with a digital camera, a mobile phone and a laptop computer, a photojournalist can send a high-quality image in minutes, even seconds after an event occurs. Camera phones and portable satellite links increasingly allow for the mobile transmission of images from almost any point on the earth.\n\nThere is some concern by news photographers that the profession of photojournalism as it is known today could change to such a degree that it is unrecognizable as image-capturing technology naturally progresses. Staff photojournalism jobs continue to dwindle in the 2010s and some of the largest news media outlets in the U.S. now rely on freelancers for the majority of their needs. For example, in 2016, the New York Times employed 52 photo editors and relied on freelancers to provide 50 percent or more of its visuals; The Wall Street Journal employed 24 photo editors and relied on freelancers for 66 percent of its features imagery and 33 percent of its news imagery; The Washington Post employed 19 photo editors and relied on freelancers for 80 percent of its international news imagery, 50 percent of its political news imagery, and between 60 and 80 percent of its national news imagery.\n\nThe age of the citizen journalist and the providing of news photos by amateur bystanders have contributed to the art of photojournalism. Paul Levinson attributes this shift to the Kodak camera, one of the first cheap and accessible photo technologies that \"put a piece of visual reality into every person's potential grasp.\" The empowered news audience with the advent of the Internet sparked the creation of blogs, podcasts and online news, independent of the traditional outlets, and \"for the first time in our history, the news increasingly is produced by companies outside journalism\". Dan Chung, a former photojournalist for \"The Guardian\" and Reuters, believes that professional photojournalists will have to adapt to video to make a living. Most digital single lens reflex bodies are being equipped with video capabilities.\n\nPhone journalism is a relatively new and even controversial means of photojournalism, which involves the use of pictures taken and edited on phones by professional or non-professional photographers.\n\nIn recent years, as social media become major platforms on which people receive news and share events, Phone photography is gaining popularity as the primary tool for online visual communication. A phone is easy to carry and always accessible in a pocket, and the immediacy in taking pictures can reduce the intervention of the scene and subjects to a minimum. With the assistance of abundant applications, photographers can achieve a highly aesthetic way of conveying messages. Once the pictures are uploaded onto social media, photographers can immediately expose their work to a wide range of audiences and receive real-time feedback from them. With a large number of active participants online, the pictures could also be spread out in a short period of time, thus evoking profound influence on society.\n\nHaving noticed the advantages of the combination of social media and Phoneography, some well-known newspapers, news magazines and professional photojournalists decided to employ iPhone journalism as a new approach. When the London Bombings happened in July 2005, for the first time, both the \"New York Times\" and the \"Washington Post\" ran photos on their front pages made by citizen journalists with camera phones. As work of witnesses and survivors, the images were less the outcome of documentary intent than a response to a traumatic shock. These photos represented 'vivid, factual accounts of history as it explodes around us', as described by \"Washington Post\" journalist Robert MacMillan. In another instance, when superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast, causing great damage and casualty, Time sent out five photographers with iPhones to document the devastation. Photographers dived deep into the site and captured pictures in close proximity to the storm and human suffering. One of the shots, raging ocean waves collapsing on Coney Island in Brooklyn, taken by Benjamin Lowy, made the cover of Time's November 12 issue. Then in 2013, the Chicago Sun-Times got rid of its entire staff of 28 photographers, including John H. White, a Pulitzer Prize winner in photography. The newspaper cited viewers shifting towards more video as a reason. They then employed freelance photographers and required them to train in how to use an iPhone for photography to fill the gap. Some viewers online were quick to point out an at times reduction in quality in comparison to the newspaper's previous full-time professionals.\n\n\n\n"}

However, unlike a standard telephone directory, where the user uses customer's details (such as name and address) in order to retrieve the telephone number of that person or business, a reverse telephone directory allows users to search by a telephone service number in order to retrieve the customer details for that service.\n\nReverse telephone directories are used by law enforcement and other emergency services in order to determine the origin of any request for assistance, however these systems include both publicly accessible (listed) and private (unlisted) services. As such, these directories are restricted to internal use only. Some forms of city directories provide this form of lookup for listed services by phone number, along with address cross-referencing.\n\nPublicly accessible reverse telephone directories may be provided as part of the standard directory services from the telecommunications carrier in some countries. In other countries these directories are often created by phone phreakers by collecting the information available via the publicly accessible directories and then providing a search function which allows users to search by the telephone service details.\n\nPrinted reverse phone directories have been produced by the telephone companies (in the United States) for decades, and were distributed to the phone companies, law enforcement, and public libraries. In the early 1990s, businesses started offering reverse telephone lookups for fees, and by the early 2000s advertising-based reverse directories were available online, prompting occasional alarms about privacy concerns.\n\nIn 2001, a legal case \"Telstra Corporation Ltd v Desktop Marketing Systems Pty Ltd\" was heard in the Australian Federal Court. gave Telstra, the predominant carrier within Australia and the maintainer of the publicly accessible White Pages (residential) and Yellow Pages (commercial) directories, copyright over the content of these directories.\n\nIn February 2010 a Federal Court of Australia case \"Telstra Corporation Ltd v Phone Directories Company Pty Ltd\" determined that Telstra does not hold copyright in the White Pages or the Yellow Pages.\n\nAs it currently stands there is no legal way to ensure a particular number is not listed in the directories currently available.\n\nIn United States, landline phone subscribers can pay a small fee to exclude their number from the directory. This service is usually called \"Your Listing Not Published\" and the cost ranges between $0.80 and $1.50 per month for residential customers.\n\nAs cellular phones become more popular, there has been debate about releasing cell phone numbers into public 411 and reverse number directories. (S. 1963, the \"Wireless 411 Privacy Act\" 9/2004). However, opposition led by leading consumer-protection organization Consumers Union presented several privacy concerns in their congressional testimony. Right now, cell phone numbers are not available in any public 411 or reverse-number directories. However, several information companies provide reverse cell phone lookups that are obtained from utility resources, and are available online. Because there is no central database of cell phone numbers, reverse phone directories that claim to be free cannot return information on those numbers.\n\nIn recent years community web based services offer a reverse telephone directory of known telemarketers, debt collectors, fund raisers, and other solicitors which contact consumers by telephone. Users of these services can perform a search of the telephone number which showed up on their caller ID and read through user comments to find the identity of the calling company or individual.\n\nIn the United Kingdom proper, reverse directory information is not publicly available. However, in the Channel Islands it is provided in the printed telephone directories.\n\nAlthough the information is, of necessity, available to emergency services, for other agencies it is treated as 'communication data' in the RIPA regime and subject to the same controls as requests for lists of and content of calls.\n\nLike the United States community web based services, such as Who-calls.me.uk and <nowiki>http://www.whocallsme.eu/</nowiki> offer a reverse telephone directory service. Who-calls.me.uk was ranked as the UK as the 63671st popular website for traffic volume at the end of May 2018.\n\n"}

The San Diego Museum of Art opened as The Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego on February 28, 1926, and changed its name to the San Diego Museum of Art in 1978. The official Balboa Park website calls the San Diego Museum of Art \"the region's oldest and largest art museum\". Nearly half a million people visit the museum each year.\n\nThe museum building was designed by architects William Templeton Johnson and Robert W.

The dominant feature of the façade is a heavily ornamented door inspired by a doorway at the University of Salamanca. The Cathedral of Valladolid also influenced the museum's exterior design, and the architects derived interior motifs from the Santa Cruz Hospital of Toledo, Spain. The original construction took two years. Sponsor Appleton S. Bridges donated the building to the City of San Diego upon its completion. In 1966 the museum added a west wing and a sculpture court which doubled its size, and an east wing in 1974 further increased its exhibition space. Plans are underway for a renovation to the rotunda, sculpture garden, façade, auditorium, and other features.\n\nThe Museum's collections are encyclopedic in nature, with pieces ranging in date from 5000 BC to 2012 AD. The museum's strength is in Spanish works by Murillo, Zurbarán, Cotán, Ribera and El Greco. Much of the museum's old master collection was donated by sisters Anne, Amy, and Irene Putnam. The museum's first major acquisition was the 1939 purchase of Francisco Goya's \"El Marques de Sofraga\", which had belonged to a private family collection until that time and had never before been on public exhibition. The Putnam sisters provided financial backing for the purchase. The following year, director Reginald Poland acquired a portrait by Giovanni Bellini for the museum's collection. Then in 1941 the museum purchased a Diego Velázquez portrait of the Infanta Margarita of Spain, which was possibly a study for a larger portrait of her in Vienna. Other major benefactors during the museum's first quarter century were Archer M. Huntington and Mr. and Mrs. Henry Timken, whose small art collection is housed in the nearby Timken Museum of Art, established in 1965. In 2012, the Museum of Art received 48 German Expressionist paintings, drawings and prints from a range of artists, including Otto Dix, Egon Schiele, Alexej von Jawlensky, Gabriele Münter and Gustav Klimt from the collection of Vance E. Kondon and his wife Elisabeth Giesberger.\n\nThe museum houses works by Italian masters Giorgione, Giambattista Pittoni, Giotto, Veronese, Luini and Canaletto. Works by Rubens, Hals and van Dyck represent the Northern European School. The museum regularly hosts touring exhibits and has lately been working to display its standard collection in new ways, including an upstairs gallery discussing information which can be gathered by looking on the back of the canvas.\n\nIn 2010, The San Diego Museum of Art in conjunction with the Agitprop gallery created The Summer Salon Series. The program, curated by Alexander Jarman and David White, featured local emerging artists who presented and performed temporary art works and workshops in direct response to the Toulouse-Lautrec exhibition. Each of the ten presentations involved Contemporary Artists' responses to the Modern Art on display in the museum.\n\nEach April since 1981 the Museum hosts its major fundraiser, \"Art Alive\". Floral designers use flowers and other organic materials to express their interpretation of a work of art from the Museum's permanent collection. For four days the resulting creations are displayed next to the art work that inspired them. The museum also hosts events such as \"Art after Hours\" and \"Culture and Cocktails\", which encourage attendees to sample the collection into the evening during extended opening hours or partake in social events centered in the gallery.\n\n"}

The museum opened in 1976 following community and government support for the project. The museum stresses a hands-on interactive approach to its exhibits A large metal sculpture of a Praying Mantis, named Francis the Praying Mantis, is located in front of the museum.\n\nThe museum currently offers visitors ten separate exhibit areas. Current exhibits include \"House About It\" which teaches children about home building and construction, \"Bugs and other insects\" which features a collection of living exotic spiders and insects as well as a small collection of fossils and preserved insects, \"Great Explorations\", \"Sea of Boats\", \"Ladder 11\" which features a real decommissioned fire truck, \"veterinary clinic\" which teaches children about being a veterinarian and proper pet care, \"Portia's Playhouse\", \"the Garden Terrace\" and \"Big Games\".\nThe museums veterinary and pet care exhibit was created in part with support from VCA veterinary clinics. In 2005, the museum was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nThe Children's Museum consists of two buildings with a connecting walkway. The main building, that houses the museum administrative offices, the live animal collection, the fire truck and the \"house about it\" exhibit, was originally built in 1913 as part of the Snug Harbor Complex. The portion of the museum that houses the food court area and the great explorations exhibits is the old snug harbor barn, where the livestock was originally kept to feed the residents of Sailors Snug Harbor. When the museum was developed, a modern walkway was built connecting the two structures to create one museum building.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the building was designated as civil defense shelter for local residents in the event of an air raid. The sign can still be found on the back of the building.\n"}

{"id": "95373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95373", "title": "The Family: A Proclamation to the World", "text": "The Family: A Proclamation to the World\n\n\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\" is a 1995 statement issued by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) which defined the official position of the church on family, marriage, gender roles, and human sexuality. It was first announced by church president Gordon B. Hinckley.\n\nPresident Hinckley first read the Proclamation on September 23, 1995, at the church's General Relief Society Meeting, stating that the purpose was to \"warn and forewarn\" the world to the danger of deviating from its standards. In 1997, the LDS Church included the text of the Proclamation in an amicus brief to petition the Hawaii supreme court to reject same sex marriage. The LDS Church has published copies of the Proclamation in many languages, distributing them worldwide, and some Latter-day Saints have framed the Proclamation for display in their church buildings and homes.\n\nThe Proclamation has been discussed and referenced in the church's general conferences as well as in many other types of church meetings throughout the world. For instance, the Proclamation and the associated issues addressed were discussed during the church's 2008 Worldwide Leadership Training Meeting.\n\nThe Proclamation has also been influential among leaders of other religious traditions. For example, in 2014 the Vatican's \"Humanum: An International Interreligious Colloquium on the Complimentarity of Man and Woman\" featured several world leaders including Pope Francis and Muslim theologian Dr. Rasoul Rasoulipour quoting from or citing its basic teachings.\n\nAlthough the Proclamation presents no new doctrines or policies, it provides an official statement of the church on gender and sex.\n\n\n\n\nThe LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign has cited the Proclamation as an indication that although telling families not to reject children due to their sexual orientation and telling members to treat them with love and compassion, the church restricts those who believe themselves to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender from fully integrating into the LDS Church if they act on their same-sex attraction. Those who do act on their feelings may be disciplined in various ways including excommunication. Because discipline is administered locally actual practice differs geographically.\nThe church also issued this statement after the Human Rights Campaign's criticism: \n\nThe LDS Church has characterized the Proclamation as a reaffirmation of standards \"repeatedly stated throughout its history.\" Apostle Boyd K. Packer also stated in General Conference that it \"qualifies according to the definition as a revelation and it would do well that members of the\nChurch read and follow it.\" It is particularly important because, although not canonized, the Proclamation is only the fifth such statement in the history of the church. The Proclamation was especially authoritative because it was issued in the name of the three members of the First Presidency and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, each of the fifteen signatories being considered by members of the LDS Church as \"prophet, seer, and revelators.\" The principles established by the Proclamation were cited by Latter-day Saints during the campaign by the LDS Church and its members in support of California Proposition 8 (2008).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34290996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34290996", "title": "The Music Trades (magazine)", "text": "The Music Trades (magazine)\n\nThe Music Trades is a -year-old American trade magazine that covers a broad spectrum of music and music commerce, domestically and abroad. The magazine was founded in New York City in 1890 and, since the mid-1970s, has been based in Englewood, New Jersey. \"The Music Trades\" is one of the longest-running, without interruption, trade publications in the world. The 2018 issue — Vol. , No. — is approximately the issue. A controlling ownership over the last years — percent of the publication's total age — has been held by three generations of the Majeski family, making it among the few current publications of any ilk that has been closely held by a single family for as long a period.\n\n\"The Music Trades\" was founded in 1890 by John Christian Freund (1848–1924) and Milton Weil (1871–1935). Freund and Weil also, in 1898, founded \"Musical America,\" the oldest American magazine on classical music.\n\nFreund, who matriculated in 1868 at Exeter College, Oxford but left after three years without a degree, had first been a playwright and actor. Freund emigrated to New York in 1871. In 1875, he founded \"The Music Trade Review,\" a fortnightly publication that he later renamed \"The Musical and Dramatic Times and Music Trade Review.\" The publication ran for about 2 years. In 1878, Freund founded the \"Musical Times\", which soon changed to \"Musical and Dramatic Times.\" On January 7, 1882, Freund launched a weekly magazine, \"Music: A Review\" (Vol., No. 1), which contained an insert called \"The Music Trade\". Sometime on or before July 8, 1882, Freund changed the name to \"Music and Drama\", supplemented by \"Freund's Daily Music and Drama.\" \"Music and Drama\" evolved into the weekly publication, \"The Music Trades.\"\n\nIn 1884, Freund, with John Travis Quigg (1839–1893), founded \"The American Musician\", which ran until 1891 and became the official publication of the National League of Musicians, the forerunner of the American Federation of Musicians. Before founding the \"American Musician\", Henry Cood Watson (1818–1875) began in 1864 the publication \"Watson's Art Journal,\" devoted to music criticism and trade. Watson died in 1875 and his \"Journal\" was taken over by his pupil, William M. Thoms, who improved it, renamed it \"American Art Journal\", edited it until his retirement in 1906, then, upon his retirement, merged it with the \"American Musician.\"\n\nAround 1895, Freund's younger brother, Harry Edward Freund (1863–1950), was editor of \"Musical Weekly,\" which continued as a weekly with a new name, beginning January 1896, as \"The Musical Age.\" The publication was aimed at piano dealers.\n\nMilton Weil (1871–1935) was married to the actress Henrietta Lander \"(née\" Rich; 1874–1935). On June 13, 1927, three years after Freund died, Weil sold \"The Music Trades\" and \"Musical America\" to a newly formed syndicate that acquired four other publications and consolidated them into Trade Publications, Inc., headed by Walter Crawford Howey (1882–1954) as president, Verne Hardin Porter (1888–1942) as vice president and secretary, and Edwin John Rosencrans (1870–1935), as treasurer. The other publications were \"The American Architect,\" \"The Barbers' Journal,\" \"Beauty Culture,\" and \"Perfumers' Journal.\"\n\nSchluter & Company and Shields & Company were the investment bankers who handled the deal, which involved an issuance of $1,100,000 in preferred and common stock. Howey, Porter, and Rosencrans were also directors of Trade Publications, Inc. The other directors were G. Murray Hulbert, John Zollikoffer Lowe, Jr. (1884–1951), and Joseph Urban. Shields & Company and Nixon & Company, of Philadelphia, also made s public offering of ten-year percent gold bonds of Trade Publications, Inc., that carried warrants to purchase common stock at a price that closely corresponded with the value of the stock.\n\nHowey and Porter had been former executives of the Hearst Corporation. Rosencrans was the managing editor of \"The American Architect.\" Years before the deal, Rosencrans, a civil engineer, had been partners with architect John F. Jackson (1867–1948). Their firm, Jackson & Rosencrans, designed over seventy YMCAs. Lowe was a lawyer and onetime law partner in a firm with Samuel Seabury.\n\nWalter Howey — who, before heading Trade Publications, had been the founding managing editor of the \"New York Daily Mirror\" — left Trade Publications to again become the managing editor of the \"Mirror\" on August 1, 1928. Trade Publications, Inc., filed for bankruptcy in 1929. The Irving Trust Co. was appointed receiver for Trade Publications, Inc., which had liabilities of $716,839 and assets of $59,511. John Logan Lyttle (1879–1930), bankruptcy referee, sold at auction to John Majeski, Weil's former assistant, on July 19, 1929, four of the six magazines for $45,200: (i) \"Musical America\", (ii) \"The Music Trades\", (iii) \"The Barbers' Journal\", and (iv) \"Beauty Culture.\" Of the $45,000 Majeski paid for the six publications, $11,000 of it was attributable to \"Musical America\" and \"The Music Trades,\" for which, three years earlier, around 1926–1927, he had offered a quarter of a million dollars, in a losing bid against Trade Publications, Inc. Majeski's acquisition included the publications' names, a collection of back issues, and a few months of office space in the Steinway Building.\n\nA few months before the bankruptcy auction on July 19, 1929, Weil was said to have sold all his interest in Trade Publications, Inc., for $200,000 in preferred stock. After he sold, he and his wife moved to Paris, where they were residing during the bankruptcy auction. The bankruptcy sale wiped-out Weil's stake built-up over a lifetime. Weil, at the time of the bankruptcy sale, was said to have only taken $5,000 with him to Paris. Weil's father, Jacob A. Weil (1835–1913), was a Paris-born American and his mother, Dina \"(née\" Lilienthal; born 1843), was a German-born American.\n\nDistraught over the loss of their fortune during the pre-Crash of 1929, then the Crash, and their subsequent inability to recover during the Great Depression – Milton and Henrietta Weil carried out a double suicide pact on May 22, 1935, leaving a note and taking veronal in their room of the Hotel Scribe in the Opera District of Paris. Henrietta died the next morning, May 23, 7:40 at the American Hospital; Milton died 23 hours and 25 minutes later, May 24, 7:05 , at the same hospital. They are buried next to each other at the New Cemetery of Neuilly-sur-Seine.\n\nFreund and Weil's publications gave them broad access in the field of music. Notably, they served as bridges between the art and the money, connecting artists, organizations, commerce, and public policy. The spectrum that both publications collectively chronicled gave Freund and Weil a strong platform to serve as advocates, opinion leaders, conciliators, counselors, arbiters, and ambassadors for music and the music trades in America. As an example, Freund and Weil were influential in the founding of the National Music Managers Association (for national managers) and the National Concert Managers' Association (for local managers), aimed at improving cooperation between the two for the benefit of musicians. Also, Freund and Weil were, in 1918, the founding president and secretary-treasurer, respectively, of the Musical Alliance of the United States, an organization that endures today. At its founding, Freund had called for an alliance to organize \"all workers in the field, from the man at the bench in a piano factory to the conductor of the great symphony.\"\n\nOn July 19, 1929, John Francis Majeski, Sr. (1892–1971) — who in 1910 had joined the staff of \"Musical America,\" which at the time owned \"The Musical Trades\" — became the new owner of (i) \"The Music Trades\", (ii) \"Musical America\", (ii) \"Barbers Journal\", and (iv) \"Beauty Culture.\" On August 22, 1929, Majeski formed three holding companies: The Music Trades Corporation, The Musical America Corporation, and Beauty Culture Publishing Corporation — the third as holding company for \"Barbers Journal\" and \"Beauty Culture.\"\n\nIn 1959, Majeski sold \"Musical America\" — which later merged with \"High Fidelity\" in 1964 — but retained his interest in \"The Musical Trades,\" and served as its publisher until his death. At the time of his death, his son, John Francis Majeski, Jr. (1921–2011), was the magazine's editor. John Majeski, Jr., was the magazine's editor until 1982 and its publisher until 1985. In 2005, John Majeski, Jr., received the American Music Conference Lifetime Achievement Award for his achievements, contribution to music, and long tenure as editor of \"The Music Trades.\"\n\n\"The Music Trades\" has been controlled by the Majeski family for years (since July 19, 1929). Its holding company is The Music Trades Corporation, a New Jersey entity based in Englewood, which is controlled by the third-generation Majeski family — Paul Anton Majeski (born 1960), publisher since 1985, and Brian T. Majeski (born 1956), editor since 1982. Paul holds a bachelor's degree in accounting from Ohio Wesleyan University (1982) and Brian holds a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Lawrence University (1978).\n\nArticles and quotes\n\n\nHistoric reviews\n\nThe December 20, 1919, issue, as a whole, bears some similarities to some of the special macro-economic issues of the 21st-century.

Along the same lines as the Latin \"carpe diem\" (\"seize the day\"), it is a call to live life to its fullest extent, even embracing behavior which carries inherent risk. \n\nSimilar phrases have been in use for more than a century, including these:\n\nIn the early 21st century, the acronym \"YOLO\" became a staple of music and youth culture, being a subject of graffiti, Twitter hashtags, pranks, tattoos, music, television shows, and merchandise.\n\nThe acronym was most popularized in the 21st century by rapper Drake, who planned to release a 2011 joint mixtape titled \"YOLO\" along with Rick Ross. To promote this mixtape, \"YOLO\" was mentioned prominently on several of their tracks such as \"The Motto\", released on November 29, 2011, with the aim of promoting the tape. This use is said to have elevated the word into prominence and common colloquial use. In late 2012, Drake expressed a desire to obtain royalties for use of \"YOLO\" due to the proliferation of merchandise bearing the phrase and lyrics from his song, which have been commonly seen at stores such as Walgreens and Macy's, but he does not own a trademark on the word.\n\nHip-hop magazine \"Da South\" reported that the rapper Lecrae has deconstructed the phrase \"YOLO\" in his 2012 song \"No Regrets\".\n\nIn the opening monologue of \"Saturday Night Live\" on January 19, 2014, Drake apologized about pop culture's adoption of the phrase, saying he had no idea it would become so big.\n\nUse of the phrase by comedian and actor Mae West helped popularise it in the 20th century.\n\nA restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has held a trademark to the phrase \"YOLO\" in the context of the frozen yogurt business since 2010.\n\nComedy trio The Lonely Island released a 2013 song titled \"YOLO,\" featuring Adam Levine and Kendrick Lamar, parodying the phrase and the people who use it as a lifestyle meme. The song has charted in many countries, including #60 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nOnline media including \"The Washington Post\" and \"The Huffington Post\" describe YOLO as the \"newest acronym you'll love to hate\" and \"dumb\". The word has been criticized for its use in conjunction with reckless behavior, most notably in a Twitter post by aspiring rapper Ervin McKinness just prior to his death that described driving drunk at 120 mph (193 km/h): \"Drunk af going 120 drifting corners #FuckIt YOLO.\"\n"}

They have been described as \"one of the most important groups of ceramic sculpture in the world.\" They reached the international art market, and were bought for Western collections. At least eight statues were originally found, including one large fragment which was long thought to have been destroyed in Berlin during World War II, but has been sighted in Russia recently.\n\nOthers are now in the following collections: the British Museum in London, two in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Penn Museum, Philadelphia, Nelson Gallery of Art, Kansas City, the Musée Guimet in Paris, and a Japanese collection. With the example lost in Berlin, this makes a total of ten figures. There are fragments probably from the same set in other collections. The circumstances of the find, and the subsequent events as the figures reached the art market, have been the subject of much scholarly investigation, without being entirely clarified.\n\nA luohan (often written luóhàn) is the Chinese term for an arhat, one of the historical disciples of the Buddha. As Buddhist tradition developed, and especially in the East Asian Buddhist countries, the number of arhats or luohans tended to increase, and at least the most important were regarded as, or as almost, bodhisattvas or fully enlightened beings, with a wide range of supernatural powers. According to Buddhist tradition, groups of 16, 18 or 500 luohans awaited the arrival of Maitreya, the Future Buddha, and groups were often used in East Asian Buddhist art. The full set is thought by most scholars to have had figures for the typical Chinese main grouping of Sixteen or Eighteen Arhats, although William Watson describes this \"usual assumption\" as \"speculative\". These and earlier smaller groupings of six or eight were each given names and personalities in Buddhist tradition.\n\nThis set is exceptional in its quality and the individuality of each figure; it has been suggested that they were also portraits of notable contemporary monks. For Watson they are \"outstanding examples of the naturalistic pseudo-portrait of the period, displaying to great perfection an idealization of the face\", where \"only the elongation of the ear-lobes follows [traditional Buddhist] iconography\". The green hair of some of the figures is also a departure from naturalism. The findspot in 1912 seems not to have been the original location of the group, which is unknown, and the set of 16 or 18 figures was probably made to be set on platforms along the walls of a \"luohan hall\" in a temple. The openwork bases were intended to suggest mountains; paintings of luohans often show them perched on small peaks, indicating the mountain retreats of the ascetic monk.\n\nIn their first years in the West the figures were usually assigned to the Tang Dynasty (618–907), with some proposing various later dates in the Ming dynasty period and those of the dynasties in between. But a date in the regional Liao Dynasty (916–1125 CE) came to be preferred, although in recent years they are increasingly, partly because of the results of scientific dating methods, placed in the early 12th century, which is mostly in the following Jin dynasty (1115–1234) period.\n\nThermoluminescence dating tests of the statues in Philadelphia and New York (younger figure) produced a midpoint date of 1210, ± 100 and 200 years respectively, the midpoint being during the period of the following Jin dynasty. Derek Gillman tentatively suggests the specific date of 1159, to match the recorded renovation of a large temple in the region, which he proposes as a candidate for their original location. An early 12th-century coin was also found inside the Boston figure.\n\nThe figures were reportedly in the hands of Chinese dealers who told the German sinologist Friedrich Perzynski about them in 1912, and subsequently showed him examples, some of which he bought and exported to Europe. They had apparently been found in one or more caves near Yixian, Hebei, some 100 miles south-west of Beijing in northwestern China. Perzynski claimed that he visited the cave the luohans had come from, by which time only a few fragments remained there. He described the episode in an article for \"Deutsche Rundschau\" soon after, repeating his story in a book published a few years later, but the accuracy, indeed the veracity, of his account has been challenged in recent years.\n\nIn 1913 two figures were exhibited in Paris (without their bases), and a third (with base) was acquired by the British Museum in 1914, see Seated Luohan from Yixian. Now six figures are in museums in North America, with two surviving and one missing or destroyed in Europe, and one of the set in Japan. The Metropolitan acquired its two examples separately in 1921, by which time Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto and the Matsukata Collection in Japan already had theirs, and a further four were \"owned by private collectors and dealers\", so making a total of ten figures, \"besides a great many small fragments, several hands and feet, and baskets full of broken pieces\".\n\nThe figure long thought lost from the Museum für Ostasiatische Kunst in Berlin is a head and bust length fragment, 60 cm high, of a younger man with his head turned to his left, and his shoulder bared. In his 2011 lecture Derek Gillman reported that Stanley Abe, a fellow specialist, had recently been shown it in a storeroom of the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg. The figure in Paris is an uncertain member of the group, very similar overall, but with differences in the posture of the shoulders and its stippled design on the robes. Many scholars question whether it really belongs with the group.\n\nTo a surprising degree, the number of surviving pieces differs between sources. Most older sources say there were eight, including the Berlin figure. Three of these, those in Boston, Japan and Ontario, are reported to have later heads. This may explain why William Watson in 2000 wrote that \"Five Luohan in \"sancai\" pottery are preserved in Western museums\", presumably excluding the example in Japan. The group of nine as listed by Laurence Sickman and others includes the examples from Berlin (as \"present location unknown\") and Japan (as \"Matsukata Collection\") but excludes the one now in Paris. By 2010 Gillman says what is presumably the same Japanese example was in the \"Saizon Museum of Modern Art\" (more usually \"Sezon\").\n\nSeveral of the current museum web pages mention a group of eight, probably counting Berlin, plus the Metropolitan Museum of Art (with two) in New York City, British Museum in London, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, and Penn Museum in Philadelphia. The current Penn Museum webpage lists eight surviving figures, including the \"Matsukata Collection\" but excluding Paris and Berlin. Lecturing in 2011, Derek Gillman, Executive Director and President of the Barnes Foundation, said there were \"nine known examples; there's a tenth which may be part of the group, and three are known, er, believed to have been broken\".\n\nThe luohan at the Royal Ontario Museum, in the Bishop White Gallery of Chinese Temple Art, was one of the first pieces to be included in the museum's Chinese art collection. Although the piece dates back to the Liao Dynasty (916–1125 CE), its tri-colour glaze of green, amber, and cream, is reminiscent of elements from Tang Dynasty sculptures.\n\nThe dimensions of the figures vary somewhat; taking the younger of the two in New York as an example, they are: height of the figure alone 50 in. (127 cm); including the base the height is 92 in. (233.7 cm). The base is 41 in. (104.1 cm) wide and 38 in. (96.5 cm) deep. The whole piece weighs 450 lbs (204.1 kg).\n\nThe statues are assembled from several pieces of glazed terracotta (not stoneware as sometimes said), with their bases made separately, and using a combination of moulded and freely formed \"slab-constructed\" sections. They use the difficult sancai three-colour glazing process (here in fact often including four colours), which requires two firings. This was widely used for vessels and figures found in T'ang dynasty (618–907) tombs (this set in London is a good example), but from the mid-8th century is rarely found in most of China. However the regional Liao dynasty, founded by the semi-nomadic Khitan people, continued to use the style, although normally for vessels rather than figures, and Beijing and Yixian were on the southern edge of their state, with Beijing (as \"Nanjing\") their southern capital.\n\nThe figures, variously described as life-size or \"slightly over life-size\", are among the largest made with the technique and are agreed to be outstanding examples from the technical as well as the artistic point of view. According to one scholar \"it would tax the best-equipped modern pottery to build up and fire such massive objects without sinkage or warping or loss of pose\", though he was probably unaware that because of their exceptional size the figures have iron rods inserted internally before firing to support the structure, a very unusual element.\n\nBecause of their high quality it is often believed that they may have been made at one of the imperial kilns, which were home to the most highly skilled craftsmen. Remains of a kiln have been excavated since 1983 at Longquan (not Longquan), between Beijing and the findspot, which seems a plausible site for their manufacture, with fragments of figures with similar characteristics found, although Gillman is unconvinced by this suggestion.\n\n\n\n"}

The chief editors were Xu Yuan'gao (徐元誥), Lufei Kui (陆费逵）, and Ouyang Pucun (歐陽溥存/欧阳溥存). It was based upon the 1716 \"Kangxi Zidian\", and is internally organized using the 214 Kangxi radicals. The 1915 publication contains more than 48,000 entries for individual characters, including many invented in the two centuries since the \"Kangxi Dictionary\".\n\nEach character entry includes the fanqie spelling from the Jiyun, the modern pronunciation given with a common homophone, different meanings (up to 40), classical quotations, and two-character compounds using the character. Although Teng and Biggerstaff (1971:131) acknowledged that the \"Zhonghua Da Zidian\" \"is very comprehensive and is very carefully compiled,\" they noted three defects. The index, which is arranged by number of strokes, can be inconvenient (e.g., 2189 characters are listed under 9 strokes). The margins do not have characters to help locate entries under a radical. The two-character phrases may be listed under either component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7356820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7356820", "title": "Zihui", "text": "Zihui\n\nThe 1615 Zìhuì is a Chinese dictionary edited by the Ming Dynasty scholar Mei Yingzuo (). It is renowned for introducing two lexicographical innovations that continue to be used in the present day: the 214-radical system for indexing Chinese characters, which replaced the classic \"Shuowen Jiezi\" dictionary's 540-radical system, and the radical-and-stroke sorting method.\n\nThe dictionary title combines \"zì\" \"character; script; writing; graph; word\" and \"huì\" \"gather together; assemble; collection; list\". Early forms of the graph \"huì\" 彙 depicted a \"hedgehog\" (\"wèi\" ), and it was borrowed as a phonetic loan character for the word huì \"gather together; collection\", both of which, in the simplified character system, are . In modern Chinese usage, \"zìhuì\" or means \"glossary; wordbook; lexicon; dictionary; vocabulary; (computing) character set\" (\"Wenlin\" 2016).\n\nEnglish translations of \"Zihui\" include \"Collection of Characters\" (Zhou and Zhang 2003), \"The Comprehensive Dictionary of Chinese Characters\" (Yong and Peng 2008), and \"Character Treasure\" (Ulrich 2010)\n\nThe \"Zihui\" dictionary comprises 14 volumes (), with a comprehensive and integrated format that many subsequent Chinese dictionaries followed. \n\nVolume 1 contains the front matter, including Mei Yingzuo's preface dated 1615, style guide, and appendices. For instance, the \"Sequences of Strokes\" shows the correct stroke order, which is useful for students, \"Ancient Forms\" uses early Chinese script styles to explain the six Chinese character categories, and \"Index of Difficult Characters\" lists graphs whose radicals were difficult to identify (Yong and Peng 2008: 287-288). \n\nVolume 14 encompasses the back matter, with three main appendices. \"Differentiation\" lists 473 characters with similar forms but different pronunciations and meanings, such as and or and . \"Rectification\" corrects misunderstandings of 68 characters commonly used in contemporary printed books. \"Riming\" gives rime tables intended to explain the four tones of Middle Chinese and \"fanqie\" pronunciation glosses (Yong and Peng 2008: 287). Note that the above image of early \"Zihui\" dictionaries shows the traditional hand representation of the four tone classes.\n\nThe main body of the \"Zihui\" dictionary is divided into 12 volumes (2-13) called \"ji\" (, collections) and numbered according to the twelve Earthly Branches. Each one begins with a grid diagram showing all the radicals included in the volume and their page numbers. This reference guide to the volumes made looking up characters more convenient than in the previous dictionaries (Yong and Peng 2008: 287). \n\nThe \"Zihui\" included 33,179 head character entries, most of which were from Song Lian's 1375 \"Hongwu zhengyun\" (洪武正韻, Hongwu Dictionary of Standard Rhymes). The entries included common characters used in the Chinese classics and some popular or nonstandard characters (\"súzì\" 俗字), both contemporary and early (Yong and Peng 2008: 287). Mei Yingzuo made his dictionary more easily accessible to the general literate public by using the current regular script form of characters. Beginning with the \"Shuowen jiezi\", earlier Chinese dictionaries were arranged according to radicals written in the obsolete seal script (Norman 1988: 172). \n\nThe basic format of each \"Zihui\" character entry comprised first the pronunciations including variants, and then the definitions, giving the primary meaning followed by common and extended meanings. In addition to using the traditional \"fanqie\" spelling, Mei indicated pronunciation with a commonly used homophonous character, no doubt in recognition of the fact that it was \"almost impossible for the average reader to derive correct current readings from Tang dynasty \"fanqie\"\" (Norman 1988: 172). Definitions are for the most part brief and readily understandable, and reference to a text is almost always given by way of examples, generally from ancient books and partly from colloquial language. \"Zihui\" innovations in dictionary format, such as the arrangement of meanings, the use of plain language, and usage examples from informal language, made the book \"exceptional at the time\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 287).\n\nThe best-known lexicographical advances in Mei Yingzuo's \"Zihui\" are reducing the unwieldy \"Shuowen Jiezi\" 450-radical system for collating Chinese characters into the more legical 214-radical system, and arranging graphs belonging to a single radical according to the number of residual strokes, making finding character entries a relatively simple matter (Norman 1988: 171). To illustrate the inefficiencies of the \"Shuowen Jiezi\" system, only a few characters are listed under some radicals. For instance, its \"man radical\" 男, which compounds the modern \"field radical\" 田 and the \"power radical\" 力, only lists three: \"nan\" 男 (\"man; male\"), \"sheng\" 甥 (\"nephew; niece\"), and \"jiu\" 舅 (\"uncle; brother in law\"). In contrast, the \"Zihui\" eliminates the \"man radical\" and lists \"nan\" 男 under the \"power radical\", \"sheng\" 甥 under the \"life radical\" 生, and \"jiu\" 舅 under the \"mortar radical\" 臼. The 214 radicals are arranged according to stroke number, from the single-stroke \"one radical\" 一 to the seventeen-stroke \"flute radical\" 龠. The \"Zihui\" character entries are arranged according to the stroke number left after subtracting the respective radical, for instance, the characters under the \"mouth radical\" 口 begin with , , and and end with , , and . This \"radical-and-stroke\" system remains one of the most common forms of Chinese lexicographic arrangement today,\n\nWith the possible exception of the 1324 \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\", there were few advances in Chinese lexicography between the sixth and seventeenth centuries. Many dictionaries prior to the Ming Dynasty were modeled on the \"Shuowen Jiezi\" 540-radical format, and new dictionaries were generally no more than minor revisions and enlargements of older works. Mei Yingzuo's \"Zihui\" represents the \"first important lexicographic advance\" after this long period. He greatly simplified and rationalized the traditional set of radicals, introduced the principle of indexing graphs according to the number of residual strokes, and wrote characters in contemporary regular script instead of ancient seal script. The importance of Mei's innovations is confirmed by the fact that they were promptly imitated by other Ming and Qing period dictionaries (Norman 1988: 172).\n\nThe \"Zihui\" also formed the basis for the \"Zhengzitong\", written and originally published by Zhang Zilie (張自烈) as the 1627 \"Zihui bian\" (字彙辯; \"\"Zihui\" Disputations\") supplemental correction to the \"Zihui\", then purchased by Liao Wenying (廖文英) and republished as the 1671 \"Zhengzitong\". Another Qing dynasty scholar Wu Renchen published the 1666 \"Zihui bu\" (字彙補 \"Zihui supplement\"). The most important of the works based on the \"Zihui\" model was undoubtedly the 1716 \"Kangxi Zidian\", which soon became the standard dictionary of Chinese characters, and continues to be used widely today (Norman 1988: 172). After the \"Kangxi Zidian\" adopted Mei's 214-radical system, they have been known as the Kangxi radicals rather than \"Zihui radicals\".\n\nThe best-known lexicographical advances in Mei Yingzuo's \"Zihui\" are reducing the unwieldy \"Shuowen Jiezi\" 450-radical system for collating Chinese characters into the more legical 214-radical system, and arranging graphs belonging to a single radical according to the number of residual strokes, making finding character entries a relatively simple matter (Norman 1988: 171). To illustrate the inefficiencies of the \"Shuowen Jiezi\" system, only a few characters are listed under some radicals. For instance, its \"man radical\" 男, which compounds the modern \"field radical\" 田 and the \"power radical\" 力, only lists three: \"nan\" 男 (\"man; male\"), \"sheng\" 甥 (\"nephew; niece\"), and \"jiu\" 舅 (\"uncle; brother in law\"). In contrast, the \"Zihui\" eliminates the \"man radical\" and lists \"nan\" 男 under the \"power radical\", \"sheng\" 甥 under the \"life radical\" 生, and \"jiu\" 舅 under the \"mortar radical\" 臼. The 214 radicals are arranged according to stroke number, from the single-stroke \"one radical\" 一 to the seventeen-stroke \"flute radical\" 龠. The \"Zihui\" character entries are arranged according to the stroke number left after subtracting the respective radical, for instance, the characters under the \"mouth radical\" 口 begin with , , and and end with , , and . This \"radical-and-stroke\" system remains one of the most common forms of Chinese lexicographic arrangement today.\n\nThe Chinese scholar Zou Feng (邹酆 lists four major lexicographical format innovations that Mei Yingzuo established in the \"Zihui\", and which have been used in many dictionaries up to the present day (1983, Yong and Peng 2008: 289-290). First, the \"Zihui\" includes both formal seal script and clerical script as well as informal regular script characters, and gives the latter more significance than previously. Second, character entry presentation is improved by including both \"fanqie\" and homophonic phonetic notation, initiating a \"more scientific format\" for displaying definitions from original through extended meanings, using the label 〇 to display characters with multiple pronunciations and meanings, and indicating characters that have multiple parts of speech, all of which are standard format elements in modern Chinese dictionaries. Third, radicals and character entries are classified in a more logical manner, as explained above. Fourth, the \"Zihui\" was the first Chinese dictionary to integrate the main body and appendices into one whole, thus improving practicality for the user.\n\n\n"}
