The act emphasized restoration and legal continuity of the interwar-period Lithuania, which was occupied by the USSR and lost independence in June 1940. It was the first time that a occupied state declared independence from the dissolving Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 18th century, Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Council of Lithuania, chaired by Jonas Basanavičius, proclaimed the Act of Independence of Lithuania on February 16, 1918. Lithuania enjoyed independence for two decades. In August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. The Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) were assigned to the Soviet sphere of influence and subsequently were occupied in June 1940 and converted into soviet socialist republics.\n\nIn Lithuania's case, President Antanas Smetona left the country rather than accept the occupation. He did not resign, but turned over his presidential duties to Prime Minister Antanas Merkys as per the constitution. The next day, Merkys declared himself president in his own right. Two days later, under Soviet pressure, he appointed Justas Paleckis, a left-wing journalist and longtime opponent of the Smetona regime, as prime minister. Merkys then resigned at Moscow's insistence, making Paleckis acting president as well. The Soviets then used the Paleckis government to give the final Soviet takeover the appearance of legality.\n\nThe Paleckis government staged a heavily rigged election for a \"People's Seimas,\" in which voters were presented with a single Communist-dominated list. The newly-elected People's Seimas met on July 21 with only one piece of business–a resolution declaring Lithuania a Soviet republic and petitioning for admission to the Soviet Union, which carried unanimously. The Soviet Union duly \"approved\" the request on August 3. Since then, Soviet sources have maintained that Lithuania's petition to join the Soviet Union marked the culmination of a Lithuanian socialist revolution, and thus represented the legitimate desire of the Lithuanian people to join the Soviet Union.\nThe Soviet authorities undertook Sovietization policies: nationalization of all private property, collectivization of agriculture, suppression of the Catholic Church, and imposition of totalitarian control. At the same time free education and free national health system were also introduced. The armed anti-Soviet partisans were liquidated by 1953. Approximately 130,000 Lithuanians, dubbed \"enemies of the people\", were deported into Siberia (see June deportation and March deportation). After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, the Soviet Union adopted de-Stalinization policies and ended mass persecutions. Nonviolent resistance continued both in Lithuania and among the Lithuanian diaspora. These movements were secret, illegal, and more focused on social issues, human rights, and cultural affairs rather than political demands.\n\nAs Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to revive the economy of the Soviet Union, he introduced glasnost (\"openness\") and perestroika (\"restructuring\").\n\nGorbachev's political agenda went for great and deep changes within the Soviet government, as such, Gorbachev invited the soviet public into open and public discussions unseen before.\n\nFor the soviet Lithuanian dissidents, and activists, it was a golden opportunity not to be missed, to bring their movements from underground into the public life.\n\nOn August 23, 1987 (48th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact), the Lithuanian Liberty League organized the first public protest rally that did not result in arrests.\n\nEncouraged by the non arrests, by mid-1988, a group of 35 intellectuals organized the Sąjūdis Reform Movement with the original goal of supporting, discussing, and implementing Gorbachev's reforms yet short of openly supporting independence from the USSR.\n\nHowever, Sąjūdis grew in popularity, attracting large crowds to rallies in Vingis Park and therefore radicalizing its agenda, taking advantage of Gorbachev's passiveness.\n\nBy 1989, Sąjūdis, not afraid of angering Moscow and causing a violent clampdown, continuously pushed further with its demands: from limited discussions on Gorbachev's reforms, to demand of greater say in economic decisions, to political autonomy within the Soviet Union.\n\nBy the time of the Baltic Way, a human chain spanning over 600 kilometres (370 mi) across the three Baltic states to mark the 50th anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, full independence was the official goal of Sąjūdis.\n\nParliamentary elections of February 1990 were the first free and democratic elections in Lithuania since World War II. The people overwhelmingly voted for the candidates endorsed by Sąjūdis, even though the movement did not run as a political party. The result was the first post-war non-communist government. During its first assembly on March 11, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR elected Vytautas Landsbergis as its chairman, changed its name to the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania, and formally declared the re-establishment of the State of Lithuania. The act was approved at 10:44 pm by 124 members of the council while six abstained. There were no votes against.\n\nThe Supreme Council took the line that Lithuania's original declaration of independence in 1918 was still valid, and considered the Act to be a reassertion of an independence that still legally existed on international law. It was based on the premise that Smetona never resigned, and Merkys' takeover of the presidency was illegal and unconstitutional. Lithuania's official position on the matter since then has been that all subsequent acts leading up to the Soviet annexation were \"ipso facto\" void.\n\nThe Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania served as a model and inspiration to other Soviet republics. However, the issue of independence was not immediately settled and recognition by other countries was not certain.\n\nMikhail Gorbachev called the Act of Independence illegal and the USSR demanded revocation of the Act and began applying sanctions against Lithuania including an economic blockade. In addition, on January 13, 1991 Soviet forces stormed the Parliament building in Vilnius along with the Vilnius TV Tower. Unarmed civilian Lithuanians confronted Soviet soldiers. Fourteen people were killed and seven hundred injured in what became known as January Events.\n\nOn May 31, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Moldavian SSR voted to recognize the Restoration of the Independence of Lithuania. The Parliament of Moldavia was the first in the world to recognize Lithuania's Independence, but Moldavia was still part of the Soviet Union.\n\nOn February 11, 1991, the Icelandic parliament voted to confirm that Iceland's 1922 recognition of Lithuanian independence was still in full effect, as it never formally recognized the Soviet Union's control over Lithuania, and that full diplomatic relations should be established as soon as possible. They were followed by Denmark, Slovenia and Croatia (within Yugoslavia) and Latvia.\n\nAfter the failed August Coup, Lithuanian independence recognition was reconfirmed by the United States on September 2.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush announced that if the Soviet Union were to use armed force against Lithuania, the U.S. would react accordingly.\n\nFinally, on September 6, 1991 Lithuania's independence was recognized by the Soviet Union.\n\nThen recognition of Lithuania's independence was quickly followed by several countries including China, India and Belarus as well as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nOn September 17, 1991, it was welcomed as a member of the United Nations along with Estonia and Latvia.\n\nSince 2004, Lithuania along with Estonia and Latvia became members of the European Union and NATO. The country eventually banned displays of Soviet and Nazi symbols in 2008.\n\n\n"}

It was the second work printed in the English colonies of America altogether (the first being \"The Oath of a Free-man\", printed earlier in the same year). The earliest New England almanac of which an extant copy survives in the Library of Congress was published by Zechariah Brigden in Cambridge in 1659. \nHarvard College became the first center for the annual publication of almanacs with various editors including Samuel Danforth, Oakes, Cheever, Chauncey, Dudley, Foster, et alia. An almanac maker going under the pseudonym of Poor Richard, Knight of the Burnt Island began to publish \"Poor Robin's Almanack\" one of the first comic almanacs that parodied these horoscopes in its 1664 issue, saying \"This month we may expect to hear of the Death of some Man, Woman, or Child, either in Kent or Christendom.\" Other noteworthy comic almanacs include those published from 1687-1702 by John Tully of Saybrook, Connecticut. \nThe \"Boston ephemeris\" was an early almanac published in Boston during the 1680s.\n\nThe most important early American almanacs were made from 1726-1775 by Nathaniel Ames of Dedham, Massachusetts. A few years later James Franklin began publishing the \"Rhode-Island Almanack\" beginning in 1728. Five years later his brother Benjamin Franklin began publishing \"Poor Richard's Almanack\" from 1733-1758. Benjamin Banneker improved on the Almanac from 1792-1797.\n\nFrom the late 18th to early 19th century, there began a fashion of \"Farmers' Almanacs\" published regionally in the newly independent United States.\n\n\n"}

The term literally means \"\"peace and health [for the mentally ill]\". Many of these institutions are prison-hospitals for holding prisoners judged to be mentally ill, and operate directly under the local Public Security Bureau. As a result, \"ankang\"\" is sometimes used in the Western press to denote the system of prison-hospitals in China. However, not all \"ankang\" hospitals are prison-hospitals, and some offer conventional psychiatric and medical treatment services.\n\nSome patients sent to these institutions are political prisoners or Falun Gong practitioners. By some estimates 3,000 political prisoners are held in about 25 \"ankang\" institutions across China.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of State, there were 20 \"ankang\" hospitals in China in early 2009, which are overseen by the Ministry of Public Security.\n\n\nWang Wanxing, a prominent democracy activist with a history of anti-government protest, was again arrested on June 4, 1992 when he unfurled a banner in Tiananmen Square on the third anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He was swiftly arrested and locked up in a psychiatric hospital near Beijing, with a concocted diagnosis of \"political monomania\". Following his release in 2006, Wang was examined for two days by Dr. Raes and Dr. van der Meer, who said in a statement: \"He was not suffering from any mental disorder that could justify his admission.\" Human Rights Watch says it has documented 3,000 cases of psychiatric punishment of political dissidents since the early 1980s.\n\nIn 2000, Robin J. Munro drew attention when he made allegations of abuses of forensic psychiatry in China. In 2002, Human Rights Watch and the Geneva Initiative on Psychiatry issued a report which alleged that Chinese dissidents, independent labour organisers, whistle-blowers and individuals who complain about official misconduct have been labelled \"political maniacs\" and locked up in mental hospitals simply for opposing the government. Symptoms of \"political mania\" as defined by the police include \"shout[ing] reactionary slogans, writ[ing] reactionary banners and reactionary letters, mak[ing] anti-government speeches in public, and express[ing] opinions on important domestic and international affairs\". Such individuals may be detained indefinitely in \"ankang\" centres.\n\n"}

It represents Canadian museum professionals both within Canada and internationally. As with most trade associations, it aims to improve the recognition, growth and stability of its constituency. Its staff supports their nearly 2,000 members with conferences, publications, and networking opportunities.\n\nCMA members include national museums, non-profit museums, art galleries, science centres, aquariums, archives, sport halls-of-fame, artist-run centres, zoos and historic sites across Canada. They range from large metropolitan galleries to small community museums. All are dedicated to preserving and presenting Canada's cultural heritage to the public.\n\nIn 1932, British Museums Association President Sir Henry Miers visited museums in Canada and found them \"in a deplorable state and far behind those of the United States and most European countries.\" According to notes later left in CMA bylaws, the intention had been to form an Association in the 1930s, but was delayed due to the Second World War. \n\nFollowing the war, the idea for an Association began to gain popularity. In a 1946 letter to Alice Johannsen Turham of the McGill University Museums, Dr. Harry O. McCurry of the National Gallery of Canada explained: As you know I have always felt that a Canadian Museums Association is essential to the proper development of a Canadian museum service and I hope you feel the same way. I was astonished to hear from one prominent curator, that he thought we ought not to form an association of our own but to link up with the U.S.A. I am all for most cordial cooperation with the American Museums Association in every way but we need an organization of our own to deal with problems which are particularly Canadian.A small group of representatives from 13 museums met in Quebec City, QC during the 42nd Annual Meeting of the American Association of Museums (now the American Alliance of Museums). It was granted Charter by the Secretary of State on September 10, 1947. \n\nFounding Members and their institutions (at the time):\nIn addition to the above, eight more observers were present at the founding event and are recognized as founding members (as opposed to delegates).\n\nThe 1988 controversy surrounding \"The Spirit Sings\" exhibition at the Glenbow Museum led to the creation of a task force to assess and address issues of Indigenous involvement in museums, access to museum collections and the interpretation of artifacts and human remains. In 1992, CMA, in partnership with the Assembly of First Nations, published the report \"Turning The Page\" with recommendations on repatriation of human remains and sacred objects to indigenous communities.\n\nIn 2015, CMA was named in Calls to Action 67 and 68 of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to undertake special roles in the reconciliation process. \nAs of 2016, CMA is in the process of launching a Museums and Indigenous Council to address these and other issues regarding Indigenous Canadians.\n\nThe CMA is a federally incorporated nonprofit association which advances public museum services in Canada, promotes the welfare and a better administration of museums and fosters a continuing improvement in the qualifications and practices of museum professionals. It is a registered charity and supports the Museums Foundation of Canada which is a separate charity.\n\nThe CMA is governed by an elected Board of Directors and maintains a full-service Secretariat in Ottawa. \n\nSince its founding, CMA has had nine Executive Directors: \n\nCMA publishes its bilingual bimonthly Muse magazine and offers its members services such as advocacy on broad public policy, an insurance program and awards, among other services. The Association regularly appears before Parliamentary Committees on issues of heritage. CMA also hosts Canadian Museums Day on Parliament Hill to celebrate the contributions of museums to society. \n\nSince 1996, the Association administers for the Department of Canadian Heritage the Young Canada Works program which provides funds for the hiring of summer students and interns in museums in order for them to obtain experience in the heritage field. \n\nIt also offers large national conferences each year in various locations across Canada (Ottawa 2017 and Vancouver 2018) as well as specialized conferences on museum issues, such as Museum Traveling Exhibitions, Deaccessioning Standards, Art and Law symposium, Museum Enterprises Conference, Future of Exhibition Design Symposium, etc.\n\nThe CMA has both formal and informal partnerships with organizations relating to arts and heritage across the country.

{"id": "9928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9928", "title": "Ethnology", "text": "Ethnology\n\nEthnology (from the Greek \"ἔθνος\", \"ethnos\" meaning \"nation\") is the branch of anthropology that compares and analyzes the characteristics of different peoples and the relationships between them (cf. cultural, social, or sociocultural anthropology).\n\nCompared to ethnography, the study of single groups through direct contact with the culture, ethnology takes the research that ethnographers have compiled and then compares and contrasts different cultures.\nThe term \"ethnologia\" (\"ethnology\") is credited to Adam Franz Kollár (1718-1783) who used and defined it in his \"Historiae ivrisqve pvblici Regni Vngariae amoenitates\" published in Vienna in 1783. as: “the science of nations and peoples, or, that study of learned men in which they inquire into the origins, languages, customs, and institutions of various nations, and finally into the fatherland and ancient seats, in order to be able better to judge the nations and peoples in their own times.” \n\nKollár's interest in linguistic and cultural diversity was aroused by the situation in his native multi-ethnic and multilingual Kingdom of Hungary and his roots among its Slovaks, and by the shifts that began to emerge after the gradual retreat of the Ottoman Empire in the more distant Balkans.\n\nAmong the goals of ethnology have been the reconstruction of human history, and the formulation of cultural invariants, such as the incest taboo and culture change, and the formulation of generalizations about \"human nature\", a concept which has been criticized since the 19th century by various philosophers (Hegel, Marx, structuralism, etc.). In some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and pedagogical doctrine, with \"cultural anthropology\" becoming dominant especially in the United States, and \"social anthropology\" in Great Britain. The distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. Ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century, especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.\nThe 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occident (the Western world), such as the notion of the \"Other\". This term was used in conjunction with \"savages\", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian, or alternatively, as the \"noble savage\". Thus, civilization was opposed in a dualist manner to barbary, a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared ethnocentrism. The progress of ethnology, for example with Claude Lévi-Strauss's structural anthropology, led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear progress, or the pseudo-opposition between \"societies with histories\" and \"societies without histories\", judged too dependent on a limited view of history as constituted by accumulative growth.\n\nLévi-Strauss often referred to Montaigne's essay on cannibalism as an early example of ethnology. Lévi-Strauss aimed, through a structural method, at discovering universal invariants in human society, chief among which he believed to be the incest taboo. However, the claims of such cultural universalism have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including Marx, Nietzsche, Foucault, Derrida, Althusser, and Deleuze.\n\nThe French school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline, since the early 1950s. Important figures in this movement have included Lévi-Strauss, Paul Rivet, Marcel Griaule, Germaine Dieterlen, and Jean Rouch.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It has been described as the \"living will with a heart and soul\".\n\nFive Wishes was originally introduced in 1996 as a Florida-only document, combining a living will and health care power of attorney in addition to addressing matters of comfort care and spirituality. With help from the American Bar Association's Commission on Law and Aging and leading medical experts, a national version of Five Wishes was introduced in 1998. It was originally distributed with support from a grant by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. With assistance from the United Health Foundation, Five Wishes is now available in 27 languages and in Braille. More than 30 million documents have been distributed by a network of over 35,000 partner organizations worldwide. An online version called Five Wishes Online was introduced in April 2011 allowing users to complete the document using an online interface or print out a blank version to complete by hand.\n\nWishes 1 and 2 are both legal documents. Once signed, they meet the legal requirements for an advance directive in the states listed below. Wishes 3, 4, and 5 are unique to Five Wishes, in that they address matters of comfort care, spirituality, forgiveness, and final wishes.\n\nThis section is an assignment of a health care agent (also called proxy, surrogate, representative, or health care power of attorney). This person makes medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to speak for yourself.\n\nThis section is a living will—a definition of what life support treatment means to you, and when you would and would not want it.\n\nThis section addresses matters of comfort care—what type of pain management you would like, personal grooming and bathing instructions, and whether you would like to know about options for hospice care, among others.\n\nThis section speaks to personal matters, such as whether you would like to be at home and whether you would like someone to pray at your bedside.\n\nThis section deals with matters of forgiveness, how you wish to be remembered, and final wishes regarding funeral or memorial plans.\n\nThe last portion of the document contains a section for signing the document and having it witnessed. The document indicates which states require notarization.\n\nAccording to analysis by the American Bar Association's Commission on Law and Aging, Five Wishes currently meets the legal requirements for an advance directive in the following 42 states and the District of Columbia. In the remaining 8 states, (Alabama, Indiana, Kansas, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Utah) a statutory form is required, and one must attach the state document if one wishes to use the Five Wishes document as a guide.\n"}
{"id": "12327683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12327683", "title": "Fragrances of the World", "text": "Fragrances of the World\n\nFragrances of the World is the largest independent guide to fragrance classification. First published in 1984 by Michael Edwards in Sydney, Australia, the guide was originally named \"The Fragrance Manual\" before becoming \"Fragrances of the World\" in 2000. It has since been printed annually in a bilingual English-French edition. An online companion, the \"Fragrances of the World\" database, was launched in 2004 and, as of 2015, profiles over 17,000 perfumes, updated weekly. \"Fragrances of the World\" is considered a standard encyclopedic reference within the fragrance industry, colloquially termed the “\"Fragrance Bible\"” (a registered trademark since 2011). \n\nSome 8,000 perfumes were profiled in the 2015 printed edition of \"Fragrances of the World\", accompanied by brand name, date, fragrance family and gender. The online database, updated weekly, archives profiles of over 17,000 perfumes, listing brand name, corporate group, creative director, gender, perfumer, date, country of origin, bottle designer, fragrance family, an image, an olfactory pyramid and a pronunciation guide. \n\nThe \"Fragrances of the World\" database attempts to list all perfumes currently on the market, anywhere in the world. Each listing’s profile is written by the guide’s editorial team, who evaluate the perfume in collaboration with the fragrance’s perfumer and house evaluator.\n\nIf a mass-market perfume is discontinued, it remains listed in the guide for another two years, excluding fragrances deemed to be of outstanding influence, which are therefore maintained. Over 3,000 discontinued perfumes considered to be of exceptional popularity or historical importance have also been added to the listing.\n\nThe guide is independently published by Fragrances of the World, funded by individual subscriptions. In the interest of neutrality, the guide contains no advertising and listings are made free of charge. However, the fragrances houses are not systematically consulted, and the content is often invented.\n\nIn 1984, Michael Edwards, having left Halston as international marketing director, was aware of the need for a guide to help retailers suggest perfumes to consumers. Though Edwards had previously tried to re-establish Firmenich’s defunct classification \"Bouquet de la Parfumerie\", the leading manual remained Haarmann & Reimer’s \"Guide to Fragrance Ingredients\", an essentially technical genealogy unsuited to retail. \n\nThat year in Sydney, Edwards independently published \"The Fragrance Manual\", the first retailer’s guide to fragrance classification, profiling three hundred perfumes. The manual proved a success, going through several editions, and was expanded at the request of Nordstrom, first to include American fragrances, followed by men’s fragrances and niche brands.\n\nThe manual’s original linear, sectional layout, traditional to fragrance classifications, presented certain limitations. Consumer preferences, Edwards felt, did not necessarily fall into a particular olfactory group (floral, oriental, woody, etc), and could span two or more groups if linked by similar subgroups (i.e. soft florals being akin to floral orientals). This he addressed in the 1992 edition of \"The Fragrance Manual\", the first to feature an annular taxonomy known as the ‘fragrance wheel’, which organized olfactory groups in relation to one another while showing their interchange. The fragrance wheel proved a major innovation in perfume classification, its design copied widely throughout the fragrance industry.\n\nIn 2000, \"The Fragrance Manual\" was renamed \"Fragrances of the World\". The printed guide has since been published annually in a bilingual English-French edition.\n\nThe \"Fragrances of the World\" online database was launched in 2004, accessible by paid subscription. Due to its weekly updates and comprehensive scope (profiling over 17,000 perfumes in 2015), the database has largely superseded the guide’s printed edition.\n\nFragrance Finder, an application based on \"The Fragrance Manual\" designed to recommend perfumes according to consumer preferences, was originally developed for Sephora without success. The application was instead sold independently to retailers in 1994 on CD-ROM, before appearing online in 2006.\n\nWhile \"Fragrances of the World\" has largely been adopted as a standard reference in the fragrance industry, the guide has also been subject to criticism. As an independent publication, the guide’s fragrance classifications are sometimes discordant with those of the perfume houses, and the creations are sometimes attributed to the wrong perfumer, causing debate. Its simplistic categories, largely devised for retail, differ from the complex subgroups featured in smaller technical manuals such as the \"Classification officielle des parfums et terminologie\" (also created in 1984), published by the French Society of Perfumers. Its content is also limited in comparison with free resources such as Basenotes, Fragrantica or Perfume Intelligence, though it is considerably more accurate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2694179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2694179", "title": "Jesus Sutras", "text": "Jesus Sutras\n\nThe Jesus Sutras are early Chinese language manuscripts blending Taoist, Buddhist, and Christian teachings. They are connected with the 7th-century mission of Alopen, a Church of the East bishop from Sassanian Mesopotamia. These manuscripts have been named \"sutras\" (a word associated with Buddhist texts) only recently by Western authors.\n\nThe manuscripts date from between 635 AD, the year of Alopen's arrival in China, and around 1000 AD, when the cave at Mogao near Dunhuang in which the documents were discovered was sealed. By 2011 four of the manuscripts were known to be in a private collection in Japan, while one was in Paris. Their language and content reflect varying levels of interaction with Chinese culture, including use of Buddhist and Taoist terminology.\n\nThe following list gives some approximate English titles for the various writings and an indication of the present location of the manuscript where known. Scholars are still debating the best translation for many of the terms. Until a good modern edition appears, P. Y. Saeki remains the most convenient source for the Chinese texts.\n\n\n\nThe Xi'an Stele was erected in 781 to commemorate the propagation of the Da Qin Luminous Religion (\"Da Qin\" is the Chinese term for the Roman Empire), and covers the preceding 150 years of Christianity in China.\n\nMartin Palmer recently claimed, on the basis of research conducted by scholars in the 1930s, that the Daqin Pagoda near Lou Guan Tai was part of a Da Qin monastery. Lou Guan Tai was the traditional site of Lao Tze's composition of the Tao Te Ching. Buried during a time of religious persecution in the 9th century, the stele was re-discovered in 1625 and is now on display in nearby Xi'an, the ancient capital of the Tang Dynasty.\n\nSutra (literally \"binding thread\", cognate with English \"sew\", \"suture\") is a Sanskrit term referring to an aphorism or group of aphorisms. It was originally applied to Hindu philosophy, and later to Buddhist canon scripture. In the case of the Jesus Sutras, the term has been used indirectly by modern, Western authors. In Chinese, all religious and classical books are referred to as \"jing\" (經), including indigenous Chinese works, Buddhist scriptures, and other foreign works such as the Bible and the Koran. In the context of Buddhist scriptures, \"jing\" is conventionally translated as \"sutra\". The Jesus Sutras do not carry canonical status but they do comingle Christian philosophy with Buddhist and Taoist thought. A more neutral translation for \"jing\" (經) might simply be \"book\", although \"scripture\" may convey the entire nuanced meaning better.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2248728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2248728", "title": "Jewel House", "text": "Jewel House\n\nThe Jewel House is a vault housing the British Crown Jewels in the Waterloo Block (formerly a barracks) at the Tower of London. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 and refurbished in 2012. Regalia have been kept in various parts of the Tower since the 14th century after a series of successful and attempted thefts at Westminster Abbey.\n\nA Keeper of the Crown Jewels was appointed in 1207. Over the subsequent centuries his title varied, from Keeper of the King's Jewels, Master of the Jewel House, Master and Treasurer of the King's Jewels and Plate, or Keeper of the Jewel House. He was also Treasurer of the Chamber, a division of the Royal Household of the monarch. In this position he was also called Keeper of the Court Wardrobe, Keeper of the Privy Wardrobe, or Receiver of the Chamber. In this capacity, he represented the Lord Treasurer's interests in the regalia, and the wardrobe and privy wardrobe. Because of this, the Receiver of the Chamber exercised delegated authority over the Crown Jewels, especially those kept at the Tower of London (these two positions were separated in 1485).\n\nAlthough a treasury had been located in the Tower of London from the earliest times (as in the sub-crypt of St John's Chapel in the White Tower), from 1255 there was a separate Jewel House for state crowns and regalia, though not older crowns and regalia, in the grounds of Westminster Abbey. This Jewel House stood by the now-demolished Wardrobe Tower.\n\nIn 1378, the keeper gained control over at least a part of the royal jewels, and had a box in which he kept them, with two keys: one for himself and the other for the Lord Treasurer. This was the beginning of the Jewel House Department. The royal treasure was usually kept in the Tower of London, and at the Great Treasury, Westminster. Additionally, coronation regalia was, over the centuries, kept in the Chamber of the Pyx in Westminster Abbey. From the foundation of the abbey in until 1303, the Chamber of the Pyx also held the general royal treasury. Most crowns were kept in the Tower of London from the time of Henry III, as were coronation regalia from 1643, except for some items which were in the abbey during the time of James II.\n\nFollowing Richard de Podnecott's attempted robbery of the Chamber of the Pyx in 1303, some regalia were moved to the Tower of London for safekeeping. A new Jewel House was built near the White Tower in 1378, and by the 1530s the reserve of jewels and plate was brought together in the rebuilt Jewel House, on the south side of the White Tower. Regalia were kept on the upper floor and plate on the lower floor. The coronation regalia would remain at Westminster Abbey until the 17th century.\n\nThe first keeper (however styled) after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Sir Gilbert Talbot, was the last to exercise day-to-day control over the Jewel House. At that time, he was styled as Master and Treasurer of the Jewels and Plate. Spare plate was kept at the Palace of Whitehall, and later, probably, at St James's Palace. Very large quantities of spare plate were melted down and sold in 1680, and thereafter the Jewel House held comparatively little besides the items held at the Tower of London, though much of it was out on loan.\n\nFrom 1660, as the Privy Wardrobe was no longer at the Tower of London, a caretaker was appointed as watchman for the Master of the Jewel House. He later became known as the Keeper of the Regalia or Keeper of the Jewel Office at the Tower. From this appointment, a separate branch of the Jewel House Department developed. When the latter was closed down, the Tower of London Jewel House alone remained. From 1665, the regalia were on show to the public, and over time this activity of the Jewel House became increasingly important.\n\nIn 1669, the regalia were moved to a new chamber in the Martin Tower. A custodian named Talbot Edwards showed the jewels to visitors for a small fee. At first, this was a very informal arrangement, with Edwards taking the regalia out of a locked cupboard to show it. The arrangement was ended in 1671, when Colonel Thomas Blood overpowered the custodian, tied him up and, with the help of three accomplices, made off with the Crown Jewels. All the items were recovered, though some had been damaged; St Edward's Crown had been crushed with a mallet, and the Sovereign's Orb took a dent.\n\nDrastic changes followed: an armed guard was provided, the collection was put behind bars in a windowless room, and the first guidebook to the Crown Jewels was published, formally establishing it as a visitor attraction. People were locked inside the tower during their visit and only permitted to see the jewels from a distance. For a small fee, they could reach through the bars and touch some of the jewels.\n\nIn 1782, as part of a wider rationalisation of the Royal Household, the Department of the Jewel Office, under the Master of the Jewel Office, who was generally a senior politician, was abolished, and the Lord Chamberlain's Office took over the accounting functions, with an official called the Officer of the Jewels and Plate. From 1782 until 1814, there was only a resident caretaker to guard the regalia and other jewels at the Tower of London. In 1814, a Keeper of the Jewel House was appointed. He had a servant as \"Exhibitor\" (renamed Curator in 1921), responsible for the day-to-day custody of the jewels.\n\nIn 1815, a female visitor (later found insane) grabbed the State Crown and pulled it to bits, causing more than £10 worth of damage. This and the poor quality of the keeper's live-in accommodation led to an overhaul in 1816. A rail was installed to keep the public at a distance from the jewels, and the repaired State Crown and Exeter Salt were put in glass cases on revolving tables. The whole collection was lit by six powerful argand lamps.\n\nBy now, the Jewel House was a very lucrative business and, in the 1830s, the keeper earned £550 a year. When he lowered the entrance fee in 1838 in a bid to attract more visitors, his income soared to £1,500. Aghast, the Treasury, which received no money from the enterprise but paid for the upkeep of the jewels, began to make new arrangements. In 1840, they drew up plans for the construction of a new building in the Tower of London to house the collection, opened in 1842.\n\nThe Crown Jewels were displayed in glass cases in the middle of a room with large windows so that people could walk around them and see them more clearly. In 1852, the keeper was formally recognised as a member of the Royal Household and paid a fixed salary. Unfortunately, the new Jewel House building was judged to be a fire hazard, and so a new chamber was constructed on the upper floor of the Wakefield Tower in 1868 by the architect Anthony Salvin. Apart from their temporary removal during war, and for ceremonial use, the Crown Jewels remained there until 1967.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the 19th century Jewel House was inadequate both in terms of security and public access. At peak times, 1,500 visitors a day were coming to see the jewels. The 1967 Jewel House was built in the west wing of the Waterloo Barracks at a cost of £360,000 and it was designed to cater for up to 5,000 visitors a day. An underground vault extending out under the lawns in front of the barracks housed the priceless coronation regalia, while the State Trumpets, maces and plate were displayed on the ground floor. Visitors walked down 49 steps to enter the concrete vault, said to be able to protect the Crown Jewels against a nuclear attack, and the regalia were in a large star-shaped case designed by the architect Alan Irvine, around which visitors proceeded clockwise under the supervision of wardens. A raised gallery 2 metres (7 ft) from the case allowed people to view the collection at a more leisurely pace.\n\nAn assistant curator had been appointed in 1963, and a second in 1968, when a new independent body of wardens and senior wardens was created to replace the former detail of Yeomen Warders of the Tower of London who had been responsible for the outward protection of the jewels. The post of Keeper of the Jewel House was combined with that of the Resident Governor of the Tower of London in 1968, and a Deputy Governor assumed much of his responsibilities. In 1990, the Jewel House and the Tower of London became the responsibility of the new Historic Royal Palaces agency.\n\nBy the 1980s, up to 15,000 people a day were visiting the jewels, causing queues up to an hour long. The display had also begun to look old-fashioned; according to David Beeton, then CEO of Historic Royal Palaces, \"they were displayed as if they were in a jeweller's shop window\". In 1992, it was decided to bring the coronation regalia out of the underground vault and build a new Jewel House with larger capacity on the ground floor of the building at a cost of £10 million. Inspiration for the layout and presentation was taken from Disneyland, the Seville Expo and jewel houses across Europe.\n\nThe new Jewel House was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 March 1994. It occupies almost the entire ground floor of the Waterloo Block (formerly a barracks) and is designed to allow up to 20,000 people a day to see the collection of more than 100 priceless objects and 23,578 diamonds, rubies, emeralds and sapphires. They were lit by state-of-the-art fibre optics and rested on French velvet.\n\nHowever, critics derided the experience as \"just an exercise in crowd management, beautifully lit and presented but literally mechanistic\", a reference to the six-inch-thick, two-tonne steel doors, and the use of a travelator at peak times.\n\nIn 2012, the exhibit was given a £2.5 million revamp to include a new introduction area with a video showing the history of the Crown Jewels and explaining how they are used in the coronation ceremony. The jewels themselves are displayed in the order they are used in the ceremony, and Handel's coronation anthems can be heard as visitors tour the exhibition. Brighter lights were installed to present the jewels in a more natural way, and a new lift provides disabled access to the viewing platform. The Jewel House was officially reopened by the Princess Royal on 29 March 2012.\n\nThe underground vault built in 1967 is home to 25,000 architectural drawings of historic royal palaces.\n\nThe Crown Jewels are protected by bombproof glass, and visitors to the tower are closely watched by more than 100 hidden CCTV cameras. The security of the Tower of London as a whole is provided by the 22-strong Tower Guard which has been at the Waterloo Block since 1845. They are on detachment from the British Army and \"operate under orders agreed with the Ministry of Defence to ensure the security of the Crown Jewels\".\n\nThe 38 Yeomen Warders, ex-military personnel employed by Historic Royal Palaces, also provide security, though their daytime role is more concerned with managing the large number of visitors. Unlike the soldiers of the Tower Guard, who rotate, the Yeomen Warders are permanent and live in the tower itself. The present body dates from 1485, and they wear similar uniforms to the Sovereign's bodyguards, the Yeomen of the Guard, of which they have been extraordinary members since 1550.\n\nThe jewels are removed on the authority of the Lord Chamberlain, head of the Royal Household, exercised by his deputy the Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's Office. He signs a voucher on receipt of the items from the Deputy Governor. Only the Crown Jeweller can handle the regalia. It is customary for armed police officers to be present at all times. In 2011, Colonel Richard Harrold was appointed as the Keeper of the Jewel House. The Chief Exhibitor of the Jewel House is Keith Hanson, and the Deputy Chief Exhibitor is Lyn Jones.\n\n"}
{"id": "1558831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1558831", "title": "Label", "text": "Label\n\nA label (as distinct from signage) is a piece of paper, plastic film, cloth, metal, or other material affixed to a container or product, on which is written or printed information or symbols about the product or item. Information printed directly on a container or article can also be considered labeling.\n\nLabels have many uses, including providing information on a product's origin, manufacturer (e.g., brand name), use, shelf-life and disposal, some or all of which may be governed by legislation such as that for food in the UK or United States. Methods of production and attachment to packaging are many and various and may also be subject to internationally recognised standards. In many countries, hazardous products such as poisons or flammable liquids must have a warning label.\n\nLabels may be used for any combination of identification, information, warning, instructions for use, environmental advice or advertising. They may be stickers, permanent or temporary labels or printed packaging.\n\nPermanent product identification by a label is commonplace; labels need to remain secure throughout the life of the product. For example, a VIN plate on an automobile must be resistant to heat, oils and tampering; similarly, a food label must endure until the food has been used. Removable product labels need to bond until they are removed. For example, a label on a new refrigerator has installation, usage and environmental information: the label needs to be able to be removed cleanly and easily from the unit once installed.\n\nLabels for food and beverages typically include critical information pertinent to the contents or ingredients used in a product, and may also call out to certain allergy risks such as the presence of gluten or soy. The FDA also provides standards to regulate the information provided on the labels and packaging of wine and spirits. These labels include information like brand name, class and type designation, and alcohol content.\n\nPackaging may have labeling attached to or integral with the package. These may carry pricing, barcodes, UPC identification, usage guidance, addresses, advertising, recipes, and so on. They also may be used to help resist or indicate tampering or pilferage.\n\nIn industrial or military environments, asset labeling is used to clearly identify assets for maintenance and operational purposes. Such labels are frequently made of engraved Traffolyte or a similar material. They are usually tamper-evident, permanent or frangible and usually contain a barcode for electronic identification using readers. For example, the US Military uses a UID system for its assets.\n\nGarments normally carry separate care/treatment labels which, in some regions, are subject to legislation. These labels typically indicate how the item should be washed (e.g., machine washed vs. dry cleaning), whether bleach can be used. Textile labels may be woven into the garment or attached, and may be heat resistant (so survivable in hot-air dryers and when pressed), colorfast (so does not bleed onto the garment), washable, leather or PVC/Plastic. Printed labels are an alternative to woven labels. Some upholstered furniture and mattresses have labels that are required by law, describing the contents of the stuffing.\n\nTextiles containing pesticides as an ingredient may also require government approval and compulsory labeling. In the USA, for example, labels have to state the pesticide registration number, statement of ingredients, storage and disposal information, and the following statement: \"It is a violation of Federal Law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling”. A label including a company name or identification number and a material content list may also be required.\n\nMailing labels identify the addressee, the sender and any other information which may be useful in transit. Many software packages such as word processor and contact manager programs produce standardized mailing labels from a data set that comply with postal standards. These labels may also include routing barcodes and special handling requirements to expedite delivery.\n\n\nLabel \"stock\" is the carrier which is commonly coated on one side with adhesive and printed on the other, and can be:\n\n\nThe stock type will affect the types of ink that will print well on them. Corona treating or flame treating some plastics makes them more receptive to inks, coatings, and other substrates by reducing surface tension and improving overall adhesion of the plastics.\n\nAn alternative method of labelling is weaving the text directly into fabric.\n\nLabels can be attached by:\n\nPressure-sensitive label adhesives are commonly made from water-based acrylic adhesives, with a smaller volume made using solvent-based adhesives and hotmelt adhesives. The most common adhesive types are:\n\nLabels may be supplied separately or on a roll or sheet. Many labels are pre-printed by the manufacturer. Others have printing applied manually or automatically at the time of application. Specialized high speed label printer applicators may be used to apply labels to packages; these and other methods may be subject to recognized standards. Some labels have protective overcoats, laminates, or tape to cover them after the final print is applied. This is sometimes before application and sometimes after. Labels are often difficult to peel and apply. A label dispenser can speed up this task.\n\nAspects such as legibility, literacy and interpretation come into play for users of labels, and label writers therefore need some degree of professional writing skill. Depending upon country or region, international standards may be applied. Where literacy may be an issue, pictograms may feature alongside text, such as those advanced by CropLife International in their \"Responsible Use\" manual. Labels or printed packaging may include Braille to aid users with visual impairment.\n\nCriticism of label readability is not uncommon; for example, Canadian researchers found that medicine labels did not consistently follow legibility guidelines. In some countries and industries, for example the UK (food) and EU (medicines) label guidelines are not legally binding (the latter using phrases such as \"The type size should be as large as possible to aid readers...\") and thus are unenforceable. On the other hand, countries may stipulate legal minima for readability, such as the USA's FDA on nutritional information and Australia/New Zealand's code for food labels and packs.\n\nLabels may affect the environment during manufacture, use, and post-use. Choice of backings, coatings, adhesives, and liners can be strong factors. Environmental regulations and guidelines can come from many sources. Users of labels on packaging may consider some of the sustainable packaging guidelines. Based on the solid waste hierarchy, the quantity and size of labels should be minimized without reducing necessary functionality. Material content of a label should comply with applicable regulations. Life cycle assessments of the item being labeled and of the label itself are useful to identify and improve possible environmental effects. For example, reuse or recycling are sometimes aided by a label being removable from a surface.\n\nIf a label remains on an item during recycling, a label should be chosen which does not hinder the recyclability of the item. For example, when labeled corrugated boxes are recycled, wet strength paper labels do not hinder box recycling: the PSA adhesive stays with the backing and is easily removed. Paper backings without wet strength may release their adhesives, potentially contaminating recycling efforts. Labels can aid in recycling and reuse by communicating the material content of the item, instructions for disassembly or recycling directions. An eco-label is used on consumer products (including foods) to identify products that may be less damaging to the environment and/or humans than other related products, such as sustainable seafood encouraged by Friend of the Sea.\n\nInk and base stock color choices commonly conform to the Pantone Matching System (PMS) colors. The Pantone system is very dominant in the label printing industry. Additionally specialty inks such as metallic, UV ink, magnetic ink, and more are available. Ink is usually transparent however it can be made opaque. It has been known for certain companies to patent \"their own\" color. Digital labels use process colors to replicate Pantone solid colors.\n\nCollecting labels is a worldwide phenomenon, from labels used on matchboxes and foodstuffs (e.g., cheese), wine, to printed packages. Collectors are attracted to labels both for their influence on artistic design and the history of retailing.\n\n\n\n"}

The program was marketed from 23 November 2002. In 2008 he started a free internet version of it, the first online English–Sinhala dictionary. Kulatunga later admitted that he had infringed the copyright of the Malalasekera English–Sinhala dictionary in creating his software, but he said in 2015 that he no longer infringed on copyrights.\n"}
{"id": "2747212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2747212", "title": "Martin van Marum", "text": "Martin van Marum\n\nMartin(us) van Marum (20 March 1750, Delft – 26 December 1837, Haarlem) was a Dutch physician, inventor, scientist and teacher, who studied medicine and philosophy in Groningen. Van Marum introduced modern chemistry in the Netherlands after the theories of Lavoisier, and several scientific applications for general use. He became famous for his demonstrations with instruments, most notable the \"Large electricity machine\", to show statical electricity and chemical experiments while curator for the Teylers Museum.\n\nBorn in Delft, Van Marum moved to Haarlem in 1776 \"because the Haarlemmers had more taste in the sciences than anywhere else in the Netherlands.\" After his arrival in Haarlem he began to practise medicine, but devoted himself mainly to lecturing on physical subjects and creating instruments to demonstrate physical theory. He must have made a big impression on Haarlem society, because he became a member of the Dutch Society of Science in the same year, but was named director and curator of their cabinet of curiosities in the next year. \n\nVan Marum received at first no salary, but by scaring off the former cabinet concierge Nicolaus Linder, he was able to collect Linder's' salary of 100 guilders, and when the cabinet moved later in 1777 to new quarters in the Grote Houtstraat 51, van Marum lived there as concierge. He managed to scare off Linder by obtaining permission from the society to allow his servants to keep tips they received from cabinet visitors; a source of income that Linder had come to rely on. Then van Marum increased this salary to 300 from 100 by adding responsibilities to his list of duties, such as a summer garden in the Rozenprieel and eliminating other expenses.\n\nIn 1779 he was entrusted with the care of the \"Second society\" left to Haarlem by Pieter Teyler van der Hulst (1702–1778), which led under his direction to the foundation of the Teylers Museum. The Teyler legacy was split into three societies, one for religion, one for science, and one for the arts, known as the first, second, and third societies. The caretakers had to meet in Teyler's home weekly, and each society had 5 caretakers, so all of the gentlemen involved lived in Haarlem. \n\nIn 1794 van Marum became secretary as well as director of the Dutch Society of Science. Under his management, both societies were advanced to the position of the most noted in Europe. Period travelogues mention both Museums.\n\nBesides being involved with the \"Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen\", he was an ordinary member (5 December 1776) and a corresponding member (from 25 December 1776) of the Provinciaal Utrechtsch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen, a member of the Bataafsch Genootschap der Proefondervindelijke wijsbegeerte from 1784, a member of the Zeeuwsch Genootschap der Wetenschappen from 27 August 1782, corresponding member of the Académie des Sciences from 1783, and a member of the \"Vergadering van Notabelen voor het departement Zuiderzee\" from 29 March 1814. In 1808 he was asked by Louis Bonaparte to be a member of the committee for the formation of the Koninklijk Instituut along with Jeronimo de Bosch, Jean Henri van Swinden, and Martinus Stuart. He became member of the institute the same year.\n\nUnder his guidance the two societies slowly merged. His name is associated with the \"Electriseermachine\", the largest electricity demonstration machine with Leiden jars built in the 18th century and at the time a crowd pleaser for the young Teylers museum. The demonstration model is still on display, as is a smaller version in the Museum Boerhaave of Leiden. Van Marum's researches (especially in connection with electricity) were remarkable for their number and variety. \n\nThe Teyler's Museum kept its role as a museum of scientific research (some of the periodical subscriptions he started are still running) and is a repository of important scientific demonstration models from the period. Not only items regarding electricity, but also weather stations, industrial models, steam engines, and other examples of the budding industrial revolution were collected and lovingly displayed. The collection of the Teyler's was mostly based on scientific theory, while the collection of the Dutch Society of Science was mostly based on scientific practise. The rooms in the Grote Houtstraat were filled with stuffed animals and other \"naturalia\", while the summer garden was a modern continuation of Linder's old Linnaeus hortus once located behind the original city hall quarters in the Prinsenhof. Since Linder had not known any Latin, it was easier for Van Marum to entertain foreign visitors with stories of Linnaean trivia and of course, the Haarlem story of tulip mania.\n\nIn 1784, when the Teylers Museum opened its new 'Oval Room', the artist Vincent Jansz van der Vinne was hired as curator of the art collection and lived in Pieter Teyler's former residence that was called the \"Fundatiehuis\" as concierge and caretaker of the art collection. He left the next year because of continuous disagreements with van Marum over art and the opening hours of the museum. \n\nVan der Vinne was an artist born into an important Haarlem artist family – he was the great-grandson of Vincent van der Vinne. The Teyler's museum replaced him with another local artist, Wybrand Hendricks, who painted the famous oval room and many other Haarlem scenes. Hendricks is largely responsible for the Teyler's collection of Old Master prints, most notably the purchase in Rome 1790 of a print & drawing collection formerly owned by Christina of Sweden. Apparently he got along under van Marum, but when he left in 1819 at the age of 75, the Teyler's decided to discontinue the purchase of art \"for the decline in art enthusiasts in this city\".\n\nDuring the tenure of Hendriks, van Marum himself was busy giving public demonstrations of electricity in the Oval room, but was also collecting in this period (this is why he was so involved with the lifestyle of the concierge of the Fundatiehuis, since he was there every day). He concentrated on scientific publications for the Teyler library. He concentrated his efforts on three aspects: 1) Greek and Latin authors, among them the church fathers, 2) Works of natural history including travelogues, and 3) natural history periodicals, including all publications of the Royal Society of London and all publications of the Dutch Society of Science, which Teyler had been a member of, but could not be on the board of, due to religious differences with the board. The criteria for purchase was always expense. If a Society member could afford to purchase it himself it was not worth adding to the collection. Any member could suggest purchases, however, which explains why the collection is filled with richly illustrated examples of contemporary publications. The most impressive of these are the large illustrated books of travellers. To view the collection, van Marum organised \"gentleman evenings\" in Pieter Teyler's library, a tradition that still exists.\n\nThough the public is allowed access during the day to the museum rooms, the private rooms of Pieter Teyler in the \"Fundatiehuis\" are only open one day a year, on Monument Day. Because of its rich scientific tradition, many noted scholars of Physics moved to Haarlem to work at Teyler's, including Nobel prize winners Pieter Zeeman and Hendrik Lorentz.\n\nOf van Marum's three categories, only the first was discontinued at the close of the 19th century. The collection of periodicals which has been expanded through exchange networks, contains uninterrupted series that are among the oldest in the world.\n\nThe Teyler's museum created a new wing in 1996 to house a rotational display of van Marum's library collection, such as the works of John James Audubon in combination with contemporary stuffed birds of Naturalis.\n\n"}
{"id": "1981818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981818", "title": "Migrant worker", "text": "Migrant worker\n\nA \"migrant worker\" is a person who either migrates within their home country or outside it to pursue work such as seasonal work. Migrant workers usually do not have an intention to stay permanently in the country or region in which they work.\n\nMigrant workers who work outside their home country may also be called foreign workers or expatriates, especially when they are sent for or invited to work in the host country before leaving the home country.\n\nThe International Labour Organization estimated in 2014 there were 232 million international migrants worldwide who were outside their home country for at least 12 months and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment). Some countries have millions of migrant workers. Some migrant workers may be illegal immigrants. Some may be slaves.\n\nThe \"United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families\" defines migrant worker as follows:\n\nThe Convention has been ratified by Mexico, Brazil, and the Philippines (among many other nations that supply foreign labour) but it has not been ratified by the United States, Germany, and Japan (among other nations that receive foreign labor).\n\nSince the 1960s, farmers in Ontario and other provinces have been meeting some of their seasonal labour needs by hiring temporary workers from Caribbean countries and, since 1974, from Mexico under the Canadian Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (CSAWP). This federal initiative allows for the organized entry into Canada of low- to mid-level skilled farm workers for up to eight months a year to fill labour shortages on Canadian farms during peak periods of planting, cultivating and harvesting of specified farm commodities. The program is run jointly with the governments of Mexico and the participating Caribbean states, which recruit the workers and appoint representatives in Canada to assist in the program's operations.\n\nIn Canada, non-agricultural companies are beginning to recruit temporary foreign workers under Service Canada's 2002 expansion of an immigration program for migrant workers.\n\nAs of 2002, the federal government introduced the Low Skill Pilot Project. This project allows companies to apply to bring in temporary foreign workers to fill low skill jobs. The classification of \"low skill\" means that workers require no more than high school or two years of job-specific training to qualify.\n\nIn 2006, the federal Conservatives expanded the list of occupations that qualified for the Low Skill Pilot Project and increased the speed of processing applications.\n\nOverall, the Chinese government has tacitly supported migration as means of providing labour for factories and construction sites and for the long-term goals of transforming China from a rural-based economy to an urban-based one. Some inland cities have started providing migrants with social security, including pensions and other insurance.\nIn 2012, there were a reported 167 million migrant workers in China, with trends of working closer to home within their own or a neighbouring province but with a wage drop of 21%.\nBecause so many migrant workers are moving to the city from rural areas, employers can hire them to work in poor working conditions for low wages. Migrant workers in China are notoriously marginalized, especially due to the hukou system of residency permits, which tie one stated residence to all social welfare benefits.\n\nThe recent expansions of the European Union have provided opportunities for many people to migrate to other EU countries for work. For both the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, existing states were given the rights to impose various transitional arrangements to limit access to their labour markets. After the Second World War, Germany did not have enough workers so laborers from other European states were invited to work in Germany. This invitation ended in 1973 and these workers were known as Gastarbeiter.\n\n1 March has become a symbolic day for transnational migrants' strike. This day unites all migrants to give them a common voice to speak up against racism, discrimination and exclusion on all levels of social life. The transnational protests on 1 March were originally initiated in the US in 2006 and have encouraged migrants in other countries to organise and take action on that day. In Austria the first transnational migrants' strike (\"\") took place in March 2011, in the form of common actions, e.g. a manifestation, but also in form of numerous decentralised actions.\n\nAccording to the Finnish trade union organizations SAK (Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions) and PAM Finnish Service Union United PAM foreign workers were increasingly abused in the construction and sectors in Finland in 2012, in some cases reporting hourly wages as low as two euros. Bulgarians, Kosovars and Estonians were the most likely victimised in the building trade.\n\nThere has been a substantial flow of people from Bangladesh and Nepal to India over recent decades in search of better work. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute found that these migrant workers are often subject to harassment, violence, and discrimination during their journeys at their destinations and when they return home. Bangladeshi women appear to be particularly vulnerable. These findings highlight the need to promote migrants' rights with, among others, health staff, police and employers at destination.\n\nThe population of Indonesia, as the world's fourth largest, has contributed to the surplus of work forces. Combined with a scarcity of jobs at home, this has led numbers of Indonesians to seek job abroad. It is estimated around 4.5 million Indonesians work abroad, 70% of them are women, most are employed in domestic sector as maid and in manufacture sector. Most of them aged between 18 and 35 years old. Around 30% are men, mostly work in plantation, construction, transportation and service sector. Currently Malaysia employs the largest numbers of Indonesian migrant workers, followed by Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It is important to note that these are official numbers, the actual numbers might be far larger contributed by unrecorded illegal entry of Indonesian workers into foreign countries. They are prone to exploitation, extortion, physical and sexual abuses, suffered by those enduring human trafficking. Several cases of abuses upon Indonesian migrant worker has been reported and some has gained worldwide attention.\n\nImmigrants often take any job is available and often they find employment in the fields. When they finally do find jobs they usually consist of hard manual labour along with unfair pay. In the article \"Migrant Farmworkers: Is government doing enough to protect them?” by William Triplett, Triplett describes that the “median annual income was $7,500, and 61 percent had income below the poverty level” (Triplett). After losing their cultural identity immigrants try to find the way to feed their families and end up being exploited. The study by William Triplett describes the annual income to be about 7,500 dollars, or about 625 dollars a month. Triplett also mentions that since 1989, “their average real hourly wages (in 1998 dollars) had dropped from $6.89 to $6.18” One cannot expect to live a healthy life making this kind of money. The pursuit of happiness must not apply to all humans as stated in the constitution. Without help immigrants will constantly be forced to work horrible labour jobs for little to no money. Although battles have been fought for betting the wages researchers found that they have actually decreased. As the cost of living has increased the average pay for a migrant farm worker has actually decreased. Along with economic exploitation in the work place immigrants also suffer from physical exploitation in the work place.\n\nIn Seventh Malaysia Plan (1995–2000), Malaysia's total population increased by 2.3 percent a year, while foreign residents (non-citizens) covers 7.6 percent of the total working-age population in Malaysia, not including illegal foreign residents. In 2008 majority of migrant workers (1,085,658: 52.6%) come from their country of origin Indonesia and followed by Bangladesh (316,401), Philippine (26,713), Thailand (21,065) and Pakistan (21,278). Meanwhile, number of migrant workers from other countries is (591,481). Their arrival, if not controlled, will decrease the local population's employment opportunities. However, the arrival of migrant workers was able to increase the country's output and reduce the rate of wages in the local labor market. Despite the benefits received by both the sending and receiving countries, many problems arise in the receiving country, Malaysia. The actual number of how many migrant workers in Malaysia right now is very difficult to identify. The number of legally to work with a passport and work permit certain can be identified.\n\nIn 2013, the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) estimated that approximately 10.2 million Filipinos worked or resided abroad. In the census year of 2010, about 9.3 percent of Filipinos worked or resided abroad.\n\nMore than a million Filipinos every year leave to work abroad through overseas employment agencies, and other programs, including government-sponsored initiatives. Overseas Filipinos often work as doctors, physical therapists, nurses, accountants, IT professionals, engineers, architects, entertainers, technicians, teachers, military servicemen, seafarers, students and fast food workers. Also, a sizable number of women work overseas as domestic helpers and caregivers. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration is an agency of the Government of the Philippines responsible for opening the benefits of the overseas employment program of the Philippines. It is the main government agency assigned to monitor and supervise recruitment agencies in the Philippines.\n\nSince the late 1970s Singapore has become one of the major receiving countries of migrant workers in Southeast Asia with 1,340,300 foreign workers constituting 37% of the total workforce in December 2014. \n\nLike many nations, South Korea started as a labour exporter in the 1960s before its economic development in the 1980s changed it to a labor importer.\nIn 1993, the Industrial Trainee Program was established to meets the needs of migrant workers. It provided work for foreigners as trainees in small and medium-sized businesses. However, these workers were considered trainees and not official employees, so they could not receive protection under Korean labour laws. On 14 February 1995 Guidelines for the Protection and Management of Foreign Industrial Trainees provided legal and social welfare for migrant workers. The Act on the Employment of Foreign Workers which states that “a foreign worker shall not be given discriminatory treatment on the ground that he/she is a foreigner”, was put into force on 16 August 2003. Later that year the numbers of migrant workers multiplied dramatically.\n\nEven though there has been a drastic rise of migrant workers in Korea and policies are in place for their protection, the lack of cheap labour in Korea has forced the Korean community to condone the maltreatment of illegal migrant workers, and other unsavoury practices. In response, the Korean government has increased the quota for migrant workers by 5,000, to 62,000 individuals in 2013. In addition, on 31 January 2013, the minimum wage for migrant workers increased to 38,880 KRW for eight hours per day or a monthly rate of 1,015,740 KRW.\nPrograms were put into place to protect migrant workers and ease their integration to Korean society. Programs sponsored by the government such as Sejonghakdang (세종학당), Multicultural Center of Gender Equality and Family Program, Foreign Ministry Personnel Center Program, and Ministry of Justice Social Integration Program provide free Korean language lessons for migrant workers. In addition, by fulfilling all the requirements of the Ministry of Justice Social Integration Program, migrant workers can apply for Korean citizenship without taking the Naturalization exams.\nSince December 2008, Sweden has more liberal rules for labor immigration from 'third countries' – countries outside the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) – than any other country in OECD. The introduction of employer-driven labor immigration, motivated by the need to address labor shortages, resulted in large inflows of migrants also in low-skilled occupations in labor surplus sectors, for example the restaurant and cleaning sectors. \n\nAs of June 2016, there are more than 600,000 migrant workers in Taiwan which are spread across different sectors of industry, ranging from construction workers, domestic helpers, factory workers and other manual jobs. Most of them come from Southeast Asia.\n\nIn Thailand, migrants come from bordering countries such as Burma, Laos and Cambodia. Many face hardships such as lack of food, abuse, and low wages. Often deportation is their biggest fear. In Bangkok, Thailand many migrant workers attend Dear Burma school where they study subjects such as Thai language, Burmese language, English language, computer skills and photography.\n\nThe treatment of migrant workers in the UAE has been likened to \"modern-day slavery\". Migrant workers are excluded from the UAE's collective labour rights, hence migrants are vulnerable to forced labour. Migrant workers in the UAE are not allowed to join trade unions. Moreover, migrant workers are banned from going on strike. Dozens of workers were deported in 2014 for going on strike. As migrant workers do not have the right to join a trade union or go on strike, they don't have the means to denounce the exploitation they suffer. Those who protest risk prison and deportation. The International Trade Union Confederation has called on the United Nations to investigate evidence that thousands of migrant workers in the UAE are treated as slave labour.\n\nHuman Rights Watch have drawn attention to the mistreatment of migrant workers who have been turned into debt-ridden \"de facto\" indentured servants following their arrival in the UAE. Confiscation of passports, although illegal, occurs on a large scale, primarily from unskilled or semi-skilled employees. Labourers often toil in intense heat with temperatures reaching 40–50 degrees Celsius in the cities in August. Although attempts have been made since 2009 to enforce a midday break rule, these are frequently flouted. Those labourers who do receive a midday break often have no suitable place to rest and tend to seek relief in bus or taxi stands and gardens. Initiatives taken have brought about a huge impact on the conditions of the laborers. According to Human Rights Watch, migrant workers in Dubai live in \"inhumane\" conditions.\nIn the United Kingdom migrant workers are denied National Health Service treatment unless they can afford to pay. Untreated illnesses can worsen and migrant workers can die from treatable illnesses that remain untreated.\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organization, 48 per cent of all international migrants are women and they are increasingly migrating for work purposes. In Europe alone there are 3 million female migrant workers. The 1970s and 1980s have seen an increase in female migrant labourers in France and Belgium. In China, as of 2015 a third of their migrant workers were women who had moved from rural towns to bigger cities in search of employment. Female migrants work in domestic occupations which are considered part of the informal sector and lack a degree of government regulation and protection. Minimum wages and work hour requirements are ignored and piece-rates are sometimes also implemented. Women's wages are kept lower than men's because they are not regarded as the primary source of income in the family.\nWomen migrate in search of work for a number of reasons and the most common reasons are economic: the husband's wage is no longer enough to support the family. In some places, like China, for instance, rapid economic growth has led to an imbalance in the modernization of rural and urban environments, leading women to migrate from rural areas into the city to be a part of the push for modernization. Other reasons include familial pressure, on a daughter, for instance, who is seen as a reliable source of income for the family only through remittances. Young girls and women are singled out in families to be migrant workers because they don't have a viable alternative role to fulfil in the local village. If they go to work in the urban centres as domestic workers they can send home money to help provide for their younger siblings. Many of these women come from developing countries, and are low skilled. Additionally women who are widowed or divorced and have limited economic opportunities in their native country may be forced to leave out of economic necessity. Migration can also substitute for divorce in societies that don't allow or do not condone divorce.\n\nIn terms of migrant labour, many women move from a more oppressive home country to a less oppressive environment where they have actual access to waged work. As such, leaving the home and obtaining increased economic independence and freedom challenges traditional gender roles. This can be seen to strengthen women's position in the family by improving their relative bargaining position. They have more leverage in controlling the household because they have control over a degree of economic assets. However, this can lead to hostility between wives and husbands who feel inadequate or ashamed at their inability to fulfil their traditional role as breadwinner. The hostility and resentment from the husband can also be a source of domestic violence. Studies have also been done which point to changes in family structures as a result of migrant labour. These changes include increased divorce rates and decrease in household stability. Additionally, female migrant labour has been indicated as a source for more egalitarian relationships within the family, decline of extended family patterns, and more nuclear families. There is also a risk for infidelity abroad, which also erodes the family structure.\n\nResearchers identified three groups of women to represent the dimensions of gender roles in Singapore. The first group is made up of expatriate wives who are often reduced to dependent spouse status by immigration laws. The second group are housewives who left work in order to take care of the children at home. Although they are from the Singaporean middle class, they are stuck at almost the same level and share status with the third group, foreign domestic workers. Because of global economic restructuring and global city formation, the mobility of female labours is increasing. However, they are controlled through strict enforcement and they are statistically invisible in migration data. The female foreign domestic workers are always gender-stereotyped as maids and generalized as low wages workers in society.\n\nMigrant labour of women also raises special concerns about children. Female migrant workers may not have enough possibilities to care for their own children whilst being abroad. Their children may learn to regard their relatives at home as their parents and may rarely see their mothers. Frequently, children of migrant workers become migrant workers themselves. There is concern that this may have negative psychological effects on the children who are left behind. Although this has not been proven to be entirely true or false, studies have been done which show that many children of migrant workers manage reasonably well. One theory states that remittances to some degree make up for the lack of care by providing more resources for food and clothing. Additionally, some migrant mothers take great care in attempting to maintain familial relationships while abroad.\n\n\"See Migrant education.\"\n\nChildren of migrant workers struggle to achieve the same level of educational success as their peers. Relocation, whether it is a singular or regular occurrence, causes discontinuity in education, which causes migrant students to progress slowly through school and drop out at high rates. Additionally, relocation has negative social consequences on students: isolation from peers due to cultural differences and language barriers. Migrant children are also at a disadvantage because the majority live in extreme poverty and must work with their parents to support their families. These barriers to equal educational attainment for children of migrant workers are present in countries all over the world. Although the inequality in education remains pronounced, government policies, non-governmental organizations, non-profits, and social movements are working to reverse its effects.\n\nThe migrant workforce has historically played a vital role nationally and across local communities in recent times. Economic globalization has created more migrant workers than ever before. While developed countries have increased their demand for labour, especially unskilled labour, workers from developing countries are used. As a result, millions of workers and their families travel to other countries to find work. This influx of migrant workers contributes to growth of slums and urban poverty, according to Mike Davis. Some of these workers, usually from rural areas, cannot afford housing in cities and thus live in slums. Some of these unskilled workers living in slums suffer from unemployment and make a living in the informal sector. According to International Labor Organization, as of 2013 there were approximately 175 million migrants around the world.\n\nRecruitment of international workers through employment agencies is a common phenomenon in developed countries, such as the United States or the UAE. Especially members of underprivileged communities are attracked by the opportunities of living and working in the US. Some of these agencies make fraudulent promises. But even worse than false promises, some migrants are abused and mistreated by the agencies and their middlemen. Some migrant workers may have their passports and mobile phones confiscated, are imprisoned in the employer's home or at least strictly overseen and disconnected from society, friends and family; some may not receive their full wage and have to work unrestrained long hours without breaks or days off. Migrant workers may also be denied adequate food and living conditions, as well as medical treatment.\n\nIn a study done by the Human Rights Watch of 99 domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates, 22 alleged that their sponsors had physically abused them. Workers refuse to report their abuse due to fear of deportation and not being able to find a better job. It is common in some cases for a woman to fall victim to sexual violence and harassment, because the employers and their stories will always be trusted more.\n\nSome migrant workers flee from their abusive employers and seek help at the embassy or consulate of their home country. This however, is difficult to achieve in remote locations.\n\nA United States Company, Signal International, led by an immigration lawyer, Malvern C. Burnett, and an Indian labor recruiter, Sachin Dewan, \"lured hundreds of Indian workers to a Mississippi shipyard with false promises of permanent US residency.\" This was under the H-2B visa guest worker program, to work as welders, pipefitters, and in other positions to repair damaged oil rigs and related facilities. Each worker paid the labor recruiters between $10,000 and $20,000 or more in recruitment fees and other costs after being promised good jobs, green cards, and permanent U.S. residency. Some went deep into debt. \"On arrival at Signal shipyards in Pascagoula, Mississippi, beginning in 2006, they discovered that they wouldn't receive the green cards or permanent residency, and that in fact, each would have to pay $1,050 a month to live in isolated, guarded labor camps where as many as 24 men shared a space the size of a double-wide trailer.\"\n\nConviction\n\nSignal International Company \"had to compensate workers $14.4 million in a jury ruling to five Indian guest workers, one of the largest settlements of its kind in U.S. history. The ruling was based on the finding that the company and its agents engaged in labor trafficking, fraud, racketeering and discrimination, News India Times reported at that time. The jury also found that one of the plaintiffs was a victim of false imprisonment and retaliation.\"\n\nThere have been many cases of corruption among brokers who often act as if they have companies, often encouraging migrants to come to the United States. This was the case with broker, Kizzy Kalu was, \"a naturalized United States citizen from Nigeria\". \"He secured government approval to bring in Filipino nurses under a government visa program, claiming they would be paid up to $72,000 as instructors at an Adam University in Colorado, according to a 2012 criminal indictment of the labor broker.\" Adams State University did exist in Colorado, however Adam University was nonexistent just as much as the jobs that were supposed to be there for migrants. \"Kalu promised the nurses, most from the Philippines, jobs as nurse instructors/supervisors.\" \"He arranged with the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security to provide H-1B visas for the workers, saying that Adam University faced a labor shortage and needed foreign labor to serve as nursing instructors/supervisors,\" as a way to lure workers in.\n\nKizzy Kalu and \"other foreign nationals\" received compensation for these visas after they secured and received them for the soon to be workers. \"Kalu $6,500 for assistance in obtaining them. Upon arrival in Denver, Colorado, the nurses were told that there was no such place as Adam University. Instead, they were sent to \"work in nursing homes. The facilities paid Kalu's company, Foreign Health Care Professionals Group, $35 per hour for one of the nurses. Kalu then pocketed almost half the wage and paid the nurse $20 an hour.\" He continued to exploit these workers by allowing them to work while he was the one gaining their profit. He had to report to the government about these women and that they were in fact working in the country so that he could continue to receive funds, while they too continued working. And that is what he did. \"Documents he submitted to the government didn't indicate that he and his partner, Philip Langerman, were taking a large portion of the visa-holders' wages.\"\n\nEventually, this scheme that Kalu and his partner Phillip Langerman created began to become known to the public. Instead of the facilities paying the company they had created together from the work the women were doing, \"the nurses were paid directly by the facilities but were required to pay Kalu $1,200 a month or Kalu would send a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and they would lose their visas, prosecutors said.\" Soon, the nurses realized this kind of unfair treatment and mode of oppression and stopped paying him. Therefore, their visas got revoked because he reported this matter to officials.\n\nConviction\n\nKizzy Kalu was guilty of \"trafficking in forced labor for luring foreign nurses to the United States with promises of high-paying jobs but then demanding they kick back a portion of their wages or face deportation.\" He was sentenced to nearly 11 years in prison and ordered to pay $3.8 million in restitution. He was convicted of 89 counts of mail fraud, visa fraud, human trafficking and money laundering. Kalu's partner, Philip Langerman, 78, of McDonough, Ga., was sentenced to three years of probation for his role in the criminal scheme. He, too, must pay restitution of $3.8 million.\" U.S. District Chief Judge Marcia Krueger said in this case unlike many others, \"Kalu did not sexually assault, isolate or strike his victims. She describe these cases as \"fraud and economic coercion.\"\n\nOther Cases\n\nThere are other fraudulent cases by United States companies that recruit and employ Filipino workers. On 19 March 2013, in an article titled, \"Filipino Workers Urge Overhaul of U.S. Guest Worker Policies\", information is provided about the corruption in labor. \"The shipyard, Grand Isle Shipyard (GIS) in L.A., put the Filipinos to work on an oil production platform owned by Black Elk Energy, a U.S. company that, according to federal regulators, had racked up 315 documented \"incidents of safety non-compliance\" offshore since 2010.The problems at Black Elk Energy were amplified following an explosion in November on a platform in the Gulf of Mexico that claimed the lives of three Filipino workers, while three others were seriously injured.\" This problem became known because the work at this company against workers were very dangerous even before they were hired which is why work here was put to a stop. However this did not stop GIS. They needed to make their money and unfortunately the migrant workers were the ones who suffered.\n\n“The main [hazardous condition] is the sleep deprivation that they experience – just long hours of work that the [U.S.] workers don't face. They're forced to work sometimes for two weeks straight, 70 hours a week.\" They hired and recruited many skillful men from the Philippines who were \"welders, pipefitters and scaffolders were trafficked under \"fraudulent\" contracts that promised high pay and safe working conditions. But many were placed for work on dangerous oil rig platforms.\"\n\nThe Filipino Government\n\n\"The Philippine government has long lauded the fact that, every day, some 4,500 Filipinos are sent abroad to work. The remittances they send back keeps the Philippine economy afloat.The government doesn't seem to provide any protection when these overseas Filipino workers run into distress. This labour export policy is still one of their pillars of development – pushing people to other countries instead of addressing poverty or lack of jobs at home.\" Instead of sending workers out just because the process helps the economy at their countries of origin, the country needs to examine ways in which they can work with the people to obtain jobs or at least create more jobs. When their skilled workers come to the United States and are often exploited, sexually, physically and mentally it not only affects the worker, but also the country upon their return-or if they are able to return at all due to the conditions they face. These are risky jobs and journeys taken by migrants to ensure themselves better lives and also their families. The governments need to do more. \"The exploitative immigration system of the U.S. works hand-in-hand with the corrupt labour export policy of the Philippines to maintain a steadily increasing flow of cheap, temporary migrant labour.\"\n\nSince the early 1980s, increasing numbers of Mexican women have migrated to the United States in search of jobs. These women usually leave their families, including young children, behind in order to help maintain the family by sending remittances. After arriving in the U.S. they are put to work and live in places that are neither clean nor safe. Companies and traffickers promise legitimate jobs in America because they make money doing so. The Americans who exploit and enslave these people reinforce ideas of colonialism and imperialism.\n\nAn article \"Girl Next Door,\" by Peter Landsman examines this brutal and inhumane system of oppression towards migrant workers. \"On a tip, the Plainfield police raided the house in February 2002, expecting to find illegal aliens working an underground brothel. What the police found were four girls between the ages of 14 and 17. They were all Mexican nationals without documentation. But they weren't prostitutes; they were sex slaves. The distinction is important: these girls weren't working for profit or a paycheck. They were captives to the traffickers and keepers who controlled their every move.\" These girls, a large percentage are underaged, are forcefully lured from their homeland in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. This section mainly focused on the exploitation of men and women however, it was very disturbing to even learn that children were also trafficked and stolen from their homelands.\n\n\"They had been promised jobs as models and baby sitters in the glamorous United States, and they probably had no idea why they were sitting in a van in a backwater like Tijuana in the early evening.\"\n\nConditions Girls Were Kept In\n\n\"The police found a squalid, land-based equivalent of a 19th-century slave ship.\" There were doorless bathrooms, decaying sinks and mattresses, morning after pills (medications that can induce abortion) and girls were pale, exhausted and malnourished. However, this is just an example of one of the apartments and houses that were affected by this type of abuses. Many other houses or neighborhoods in the U.S that seem to be upscale and upperclass are infested with these types of illegal actions.\n\nThe \"People's Movement for Human Rights Education (PDHRE)\" have composed a list of fourteen rights for migrant workers.\n\nMonica Rosales (a professor from Colorado State University) describes work-related injuries in her journal article titled \"Life in the field: Migrant farm workers’ perceptions of work related injuries”. Rosales discusses bone problems, respiratory problems and allergic reactions all in relation to the migrant farm work that immigrants do to make money. Rosales discussed how these working conditions affect the lives of immigrants. Rosales states that “The average life expectancy of migrant and seasonal farm workers is 49 years of age, in comparison to the U.S. average of 75 years of age”. On top of unfair wages, migrant workers often find themselves toiling in dangerous working conditions. The life expectancy compared to average is 26 years less for a migrant worker in the U.S.\n\nA survey by Lien Centre for Social Innovation in Singapore also found that over 60 per cent of lower-skilled South Asian migrant workers who are waiting for salary or injury compensation from employers were predicted to have serious mental illness.\n\nA study of migrant seasonal agricultural workers who are employed in one of the most hazardous occupations in Turkey experience difficulties in accessing health-care services. \n\nLike transnational migration, national (internal) migration plays an important role in poverty reduction and economic development. For some countries, internal migrants outnumber those who migrate internationally. For example, 120 million people were estimated to migrate internally in China compared to 458,000 people who migrated internationally for work. Situations of surplus labour in rural areas because of scarcity of arable land is a common \"push factor\" in the move of individuals to urban-based industries and service jobs. Environmental factors including drought, waterlogging, and river-bank erosion also contribute to internal migration.\n\nThere are four spatial patterns of internal migration:\n\nCircular migration, the temporary and repetitive movement of a migrant worker between home and host areas, can occur both internally and transnationally.\n\n\n\n"}

Cyprus 16 EHRR 485 (25 March 1993) is a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights concerning Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nThe case was initiated by Alexandros Modinos, a gay rights activist who had founded \"Apeleftherotiko Kinima Omofilofilon Kiprou\" (AKOK), or \"Cypriot Gay Liberation Movement\", in 1987. At the time, Modinos was involved in a sexual relationship with another male adult, and claimed to suffer great strain, apprehension, and fear of prosecution by reason of Section 171 of the Criminal Code of Cyprus, which criminalized certain homosexual acts.\n\nThe court ruled by 8 votes to one that the existence of a prohibition continuously and directly affected the applicant’s private life, thus there was an interference with his right to respect for private life. As the Government limited their submissions to maintaining that there was no interference, and did not seek to argue that there existed a justification under Article 8(2) for the impugned legal provisions, the Court did not find that—in the light of the above-mentioned fact and having regard to the its judgment in \"Dudgeon v.

The proclamation, and the impetus behind it had a significant impact on the labor movement in the United States, Canada, and other countries for a period of several decades.\n\nThe Cloud City Miners' Union (CCMU), Local 33 of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), declared a strike over wage cuts in the Leadville mining district in 1896. The CCMU wasn't adequately prepared for the opposition that it faced from the Mine Owners' Association and its allies. The defeat prompted the WFM to rethink its goals, its methods, and its ideology.\n\nThe Butte Miners' Union (BMU) was Local Number One of the Western Federation of Miners. The BMU dominated the WFM in its early days, but control later passed to Colorado. While the WFM developed a reputation for radical politics and militancy in Idaho and Colorado, labor relations in Montana were more amicable.\n\nBy 1895, the BMU and other labor affiliates had formed the statewide State Trades and Labor Council in Montana. Butte's labor-management harmony lasted through much of the 1890s, but did not survive the industrial consolidations that arrived with the turn of the century.\n\nThe 1897 proclamation argued that the old form of labor organization could not compete with \"plutocracy\". It declared that employers' interests were \"always antagonizing\" toward organized labor. Labor organizations in the eastern part of North America were described as having an \"incapacity\" to assist labor organizations in the West. The proclamation described \"an absolute rejection\" of the American Federation of Labor, of its conservative philosophy and its complacent demeanor. The proclamation proposed organizing western laborers and western unions into a new federation. The new federation was necessary to reflect the growing class consciousness of many Western labor organizations and their members.\n\nTo: Organized Labor Throughout the West:\n\nGreeting—Believing that the time has arrived when an epoch will be marked in the history of labor, and believing that the necessities of the times as evidenced in recent developments emphasizes the fact that the old form of organization is unable to cope with the recent aggressions of plutocracy . . . ; and feeling the incapacity of organized labor of the east to aid us any in resisting these threatened encroachments . . . therefore the State Trades and Labor Council of Montana . . . would urge the of concentrating and consolidating our forces, and would urge the organization under one head, of all unions west of . . . the Mississippi river . . . as at present our force and our means is dissipated, availing us but little. By combining our expense and our efforts to the support of one organization we concentrate our strength and strengthen our resources; furthermore we dissociate ourselves from . . . the older organizations and insure a unity and harmony of purpose among ourselves.\n\nIn the west nature has located its great mine of wealth, here are unlimited and varied natural resources. In the east society has located a class who subsist upon our revenues, and a class not alone who have no interest in, but rather one always antagonizing our interests, successful too often in defeating our purposes through their influence exerted at the ballot over the unorganized, uneducated labor they employ. . . .\n\nEndorsed and referred to executive committee with instructions to forward the idea with all possible speed.\n\n—State Trades and Labor Council of Montana, \"Proposition to Organize a Western Federation for the Benefit of Western Unions,\" November 27, 1897\n\nIn Salt Lake City in 1898, the Western Federation of Miners and other labor organizations founded the Western Labor Union and subsequently, in Chicago in 1905, members of the WFM participated in the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World.\n"}
{"id": "24673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24673", "title": "Penny Arcade", "text": "Penny Arcade\n\nPenny Arcade is a webcomic focused on video games and video game culture, written by Jerry Holkins and illustrated by Mike Krahulik. The comic debuted in 1998 on the website \"loonygames.com\". Since then, Holkins and Krahulik have established their own site, which is typically updated with a new comic strip each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The comics are accompanied by regular updates on the site's blog.\n\n\"Penny Arcade\" is among the most popular and longest running webcomics currently online, listed in 2010 as having 3.5 million readers. Holkins and Krahulik are among the first webcomic creators successful enough to make a living from their work. In addition to the comic, Holkins and Krahulik also created Child's Play, a children's charity; PAX, a gaming convention; Penny Arcade TV, a YouTube channel; Pinny Arcade, a pin exchange; and the episodic video game \"\" with Hothead Games and Zeboyd Games.\n\nThe strip features Krahulik and Holkins' cartoon alter egos, John \"Gabe\" Gabriel and Tycho Brahe, respectively. While often borrowing from the authors' experiences, Holkins and Krahulik do not treat them as literal avatars or caricatures of themselves. The two characters spend much of their time playing and commenting on computer and video games, which forms the basis of the humor in the strip. Most of the time Gabe serves the purpose of the comic and Tycho the comic foil. The strip can feature in-jokes that are explained in the news posts accompanying each comic, written by the authors.\n\nBoth Krahulik and Holkins make a living from \"Penny Arcade\", placing them in a small group of professional webcomic artists devoted to their creations full-time. Originally, like many webcomics, \"Penny Arcade\" was supported solely by donations. A graph on the main page indicated how much people had donated that month. After hiring Robert Khoo as their business manager, Holkins and Krahulik switched to a different income stream based on advertising and merchandise revenue alone. According to Holkins, the website in 2006 handled more than two million pageviews daily (excluding forum traffic). On November 13, 2005, the website was given a facelift in celebration of their seventh year running and to match the designs of the Child's Play Charity and Penny Arcade Expo websites. Afterwards, the site has been redesigned multiple times.\n\nAs a (primarily) topical video gaming news comic, there is little plot or general continuity in \"Penny Arcade\" strips. Any story sustained for longer than a single strip is referred to as \"dreaded continuity\", something of a running gag in the newsposts. A character who dies a violent death in one strip will come back in the next, perfectly whole, though occasionally these deaths have an effect on later comics. For example, often, when Gabe kills Tycho or vice versa, the killer takes a certain Pac-Man watch off the dead character, but only if he currently has the watch. Profanity and violence are common in \"Penny Arcade\" and the strip is known for its surrealism; zombies, a talking alcoholic DIVX player called Div, Santa Claus, a robotic juicer called the \"Fruit Fucker 2000\", and Jesus, among others, are known to drop in often and for petty reasons. Other such occurrences are implied, if not shown, such as mentioning Dante from \"Devil May Cry\" living in the building next door. However, the comic does occasionally expand into more serious issues; one even had Krahulik, in the guise of the character Gabe, proposing to his girlfriend of two years, while another had both Gabe and Tycho praising Casey Heynes for standing up to bullying.\n\nSome of the strips are drawn from the perspective of fictional characters within a game or movie. Occasionally, Gabe and Tycho are featured as they would be as characters or players in the game themselves, often having some sarcastic remark to make about some feature or bug in the game. At times the comic also depicts meetings between game developers or business people, and features or mocks the reporters of a news article that is commented on in Holkins' newspost.\n\n\"Penny Arcade\" has a theme song, \"Penny Arcade Theme\", written and performed by nerdcore artist MC Frontalot. It was written as a thank-you by Frontalot for the creators of the webcomic linking his website to their front page and declaring him their \"rapper laureate\" in 2002. The song appears in the dance game \"In the Groove\".\n\nMike Krahulik's comic alter ego is energetic and free-spirited, but has a propensity to become extremely angry. He has a Pac-Man tattoo on his right arm, as well as a tattoo in honor of the demise of SNK on his back. His eyes are a shade of slate blue. He almost always wears a yellow Pac-Man shirt, and in one comic he mentioned having a glass eye as a result of an incident after Tycho beat him at \"Warcraft II\", although no other references to it have been made. He has a fascination with unicorns, a secret love of Barbies, is a dedicated fan of Spider-Man and \"Star Wars\", and has proclaimed \"Jessie's Girl\" to be the greatest song of all time. He practices line dancing with the Kansas City Hotsteppers. He is a diabetic, though he continues to consume large quantities of sugar products. He has an odd affinity for a cardboard tube which he had fantasies of wielding as a wandering samurai, often in feudal Japan. He was for a short time addicted to \"Tribes\" but soon grew out of it. He also has an obsession with his own genitalia and possible latent homosexual tendencies. This theory can be supported by a recent recurrence of Gabriel's \"personal\" interest in actor Patrick Swayze. Despite this, his \"son\" is also present in the strip and appears alongside Gabe's wife. As a contrast to Tycho's expansive vocabulary, Gabe usually speaks using only simple, common words. Krahulik named his son \"Gabriel\" in honor of the character.\nJerry Holkins' comic alter ego (named after the astronomer Tycho Brahe) is bitter and sarcastic. His eyes are burnt sienna, and he's almost invariably clad in a blue-striped sweater. Tycho enjoys books, role-playing video games, using large and uncommon words in conversation, and deflating Gabe's ego. He is a rabid fan of \"Harry Potter\" and \"Doctor Who\". He also plays \"Dungeons & Dragons\" often (the website's previous banner illustrated him holding a 20-sided die), and adopts a wildly theatrical style when acting as a dungeon master. He occasionally makes reference to his scarring childhood, during which his mother physically abused him and blamed him for the family's abandonment by his father due to his body, \"swelling with evil\" (in fact, his puberty). It has been mentioned that one of his aunts, believing him to be gay, regularly sends him homo-erotic material. Tycho also has a drinking problem. In one strip, after a dream, Tycho is shown to be host to an evil spirit, the presence of which is indicated by his eyes glowing with pink light; this theme is repeated over the course of the strip. Some strips appear to indicate that he has an unhealthy sexual obsession with long-necked animals such as giraffes and ostriches, or even with inhuman alien creatures. In \"Poker Night at the Inventory\", Tycho is voiced by Kid Beyond.\n\nKrahulik and Holkins began to record and release audio content on March 20, 2006, titled \"Downloadable Content.\" The podcasts specifically captured the creative process that goes into the creation of a \"Penny Arcade\" comic, usually starting with a perusal of recent gaming news, with conversational tangents and digressions to follow. As well as being a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of \"Penny Arcade\", Krahulik and Holkins discuss possible subjects for the comic.\n\nThe format of the show was mostly \"fly-on-the-wall\" style, in that the hosts rarely acknowledged the existence of the microphone. There was no theme music, intro, or outro. The podcasts were of varying lengths, beginning abruptly and ending with the idea for the current comic. New episodes were released irregularly, with six month gaps not uncommon.\n\nAlthough the shows were initially published weekly, Holkins stated in a May 2006 blog post that they have found difficulties when trying to produce the podcasts on a regular basis. The duo planned to keep recording podcasts occasionally.\n\nSince airing the first episode of the new PATV in February 2010, the podcast has not been updated. A new segment has since appeared on PATV called \"The Fourth Panel,\" which presents a fly-on-the-wall look at comics creation much as the podcast did.\n\nOn May 8, 2013 Penny Arcade launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the continuation of \"Downloadable Content\". The kickstarter was successful, with new Podcasts being added each Wednesday.\n\n\"\" is an episodic video game based on the strip. The first two episodes were developed by Hothead Games, and were built on a version of the Torque Game Engine. The first episode was released worldwide on May 21, 2008, and the second on October 29, 2008. They were self-published via the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live as well as the PlayGreenhouse.com service created by \"Penny Arcade\" to distribute independent games. The game features many elements of the \"Penny Arcade\" universe in a 1920s steampunk setting. In 2010, Krahulik and Holkins announced that the remainder of the series had been cancelled, to allow Hothead to focus on other projects. At PAX Prime 2011, however, it was announced that the series would be revived and developed by Zeboyd Games, with a retro style similar to Zeboyd's past titles. The third episode was released on Steam and on Penny Arcade's web store June 25, 2012. The fourth and final episode was announced in January 2013, and released to Steam and Xbox Live in June 2013.\n\nA teaser trailer released by Telltale Games on August 28, 2010, revealed that Tycho would appear in an upcoming game alongside \"Team Fortress 2's\" Heavy, Strong Bad and Max. The game, called \"Poker Night at the Inventory\", was officially revealed on September 2, 2010.\n\n\"The Last Christmas\" and \"The Hawk and the Hare\", two stories that were published on the site, were released as motion comics for iOS developed by SRRN Games.\n\nThe North American release of \"Tekken 6\" has a skin for Yoshimitsu based on the Cardboard Tube Samurai. An official DLC skin pack was released for Dungeon Defenders featuring Tycho, Cardboard Tube Samurai Gabe, Annarchy and Jim Darkmagic skins.\n\nCryptozoic Entertainment released the licensed deck-building card game \"Penny Arcade The Game: Gamers Vs. Evil\" in 2011, and followed it with the expansion pack \"Penny Arcade The Game: Rumble in R'lyeh\" in 2012. Playdek released a digital conversion of \"Penny Arcade The Game: Gamers Vs. Evil\" for iOS in 2012.\n\n\"Penny Arcade: The Series\" first aired online on February 20, 2010. It is a multi-season documentary series based on the exploits of the Penny Arcade company and its founders Krahulik and Holkins.\n\nUnder the banner of \"Penny Arcade Presents\", Krahulik and Holkins are sometimes commissioned to create promotional artwork/comic strips for new video games, with their signature artistic style and humor. They are usually credited simply as \"Penny Arcade\" rather than by their actual names. Some of these works have been included with the distribution of the game, and others have appeared on pre-launch official websites. An official list can be found on the Penny Arcade website.\n\nOn August 8, 2005, Krahulik announced that \"Penny Arcade\", in partnership with Sabertooth Games, would be producing a collectible card game based on the \"Penny Arcade\" franchise. The resulting \"Penny Arcade\" \"battle box\" was released in February 2006 as part of the Universal Fighting System.\n\nThere are also a few spinoffs from the main comic that have gained independent existences. An example is \"\" (ELotH:TES), a parody of the written-by-committee fantasy fiction used as back-story for a wide variety of games: originally a one-off gag in the \"Penny Arcade\" comic, in late 2005 this was expanded into a complete fantasy universe, documented on a hoax \"fan-wiki\". ELotH:TES first appeared in the webcomic of February 7, 2005, and has subsequently been featured in the comics of November 7, 2005 and November 30, 2005. Several elements of the ELotH:TES universe are featured on the cover of their second comics collection, \"Epic Legends of the Magic Sword Kings\".\n\nOn May 31, 2006 Krahulik announced a new advertising campaign for the Entertainment Software Rating Board. According to Krahulik, the ESRB \"wanted a campaign that would communicate to gamers why the ESRB is important even if they don't think it directly affects them.\" Among the reasons he listed for \"Penny Arcade\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s accepting the job was that he and Holkins are both fathers and are concerned about the games their children might play. The ad campaign was rolled out in the summer and fall of 2006 and a second campaign was released in 2012 featuring a mother, a father and a gamer describing the tools employed by the ESRB.\n\nAnnounced on June 2, 2011, Paramount Pictures had acquired the rights to produce an animated film, via Paramount Animation to make this, of the one-off strip \"The New Kid\" which was published on October 29, 2010. The strip was one of three mini-strips which featured a cinematic opening to a larger story left unexplored. \"The New Kid\" is about a boy who's moving to a new planet with his family because of his father's career. The script was written by Gary Whitta and would have been produced by Mary Parent and Cale Boyter.\n\nAt PAX Australia in 2016, during a Q&A session, Holkins revealed that changes at Paramount resulted in the movie rights being returned to Penny Arcade and the project canceled. He did note, however, that Whitta's script was complete and the project could move forward with another production company in the future.\n\nThe Trenches was a comic series by Krahulik and Holkins in collaboration with webcomic \"PvP\"'s creator Scott Kurtz. The comic followed a man named Issac and his life as a game tester. The series was launched on August 9, 2011 and featured new strips every Tuesday and Thursday, usually accompanied by a \"Tale from the Trenches\", which was a short piece submitted by a reader detailing their own experiences in the game industry.\n\nIn September 2012, Kurtz stopped illustrating the webcomic, due to lack of time, and was replaced by Mary Cagle, a former intern of his, and the creator of the webcomic Kiwi Blitz. Kurtz still continued to collaborate with Krahulik and Holkins in writing the comic. In late August 2013, illustration was taken over by Ty Halley (\"Secret Life of a Journal Writer\") and Monica Ray (\"Phuzzy Comics\"), former contestants of the Penny Arcade series \"Strip Search\".\n\n\"The Trenches\" was ultimately abandoned. The last comic was posted January 5, 2016, while the last \"Tales\" is from September 10, 2015.\n\nKrahulik and Holkins have also released an application for iOS devices called \"The Decide-o-tron\", presented by Eedar and developed by The Binary Mill. The app works as a recommendation engine for video games; users input games they've enjoyed and the app attempts to predict their ratings of titles they haven't yet played. Holkins described it as \"Pandora for games\".\n\nPenny Arcade has created two Kickstarter projects. The first was the \"Penny Arcade's Paint the Line\" card game which was used as an alternative to pre-ordering it and came with an exclusive comic. The second was entitled \"Penny Arcade Sells Out\" and was intended to replace advertising revenue with crowd funding. The leaderboard ad on the home page of Penny Arcade would be removed if the minimum goal of $250,000 were reached, whereas the entire site would become completely ad-free for a year at $999,999. The reality web series described as \"our version of America's Next Top Webcomic\" titled \"Strip Search\" arose from the $450,000 stretch goal.\n\nKrahulik and Holkins created a comic strip which compares the 7th generation consoles that appears in the December 2006 issue of \"Wired\" magazine.\n\nEvery Christmas since 2003, \"Penny Arcade\" hosts a charity called Child's Play to buy new toys for children's hospitals. They have also sponsored a three-day gaming festival called the Penny Arcade Expo every August since 2004.\n\nKrahulik and Holkins received a cease-and-desist letter from American Greetings Corporation over the use of American Greetings' Strawberry Shortcake and Plum Puddin' characters in the April 14, 2003 \"Penny Arcade\" strip entitled \"Tart as a Double Entendre\". The strip was intended as a parody of the works of both American McGee (especially the computer game \"Alice\") and McFarlane Toys. At the time, McFarlane toys and American McGee made separate toy lines, each portraying a dark, frightening interpretation of the characters and situations from \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". Krahulik and Holkins' portrayal of Strawberry Shortcake parodied McFarlane Toys' depiction of Dorothy as bound and blindfolded by a pair of munchkins.\n\nKrahulik and Holkins chose not to enter into a legal battle over whether or not the strip was a protected form of parody, and they complied with the cease-and-desist by replacing it with an image directing their audience to send a letter to a lawyer for American Greetings. They later lampooned the incident by portraying an American Greetings employee as a Nazi.\n\nOn June 15, 2011, a strip entitled \"Reprise\" revisited the issue, due to the release of \"\", another American McGee game. In the strip, Gabe suggests that he and Tycho parody a brand not \"under constant surveillance\", resulting in a spoof of the \"Rainbow Brite\" franchise. Holkins stated in the accompanying news post that \"it seemed like an incredible opportunity to relive the days of yore.\"\n\nOn October 17, 2005 Krahulik and Holkins donated US$10,000 to the Entertainment Software Association foundation in the name of Jack Thompson, an activist against violence in video games. Earlier, Thompson himself had promised to donate $10,000 if a video game was created in which the player kills video game developers (\"A Modest Video Game Proposal\"), but after a mod to the game \"Grand Theft Auto\" was pointed out to already exist, Thompson called his challenge satire (referring to the title of the letter as a reference to \"A Modest Proposal\") and refused to donate the money. He claimed these games were not going to be manufactured, distributed, or sold like retail games, as his Modest Proposal stated, and therefore, the deal went unfulfilled. His refusal was met with disdain, given that multiple games were created or in the process of being created under Thompson's criteria. Krahulik and Holkins donated the money in his place, with a check containing the memo: \"For Jack Thompson, Because Jack Thompson Won't\".\n\nThompson proceeded to phone Krahulik, as related by Holkins in the corresponding news post.\n\nOn October 18, 2005 it was reported that Jack Thompson had faxed a letter to Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske claiming that \"Penny Arcade\" \"employs certain personnel who have decided to commence and orchestrate criminal harassment of me by various means\". Holkins defended the site by saying that the \"harassment\" Thompson referred to was simply \"the natural result of a public figure making statements that people disagree with, and letting him know their thoughts on the matter via his publicly available contact information\".\n\nOn October 21, 2005 Thompson claimed to have sent a letter to John McKay, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington, in an attempt to get the FBI involved. Thompson re-iterated his claims of \"extortion\" and accused \"Penny Arcade\" of using \"their Internet site and various other means to encourage and solicit criminal harassment\". Penny Arcade denied the charge of \"extortion\", noting that they paid the $10,000 to charity, and asked nothing in return.\n\nThompson claimed the harassment of him is a direct result of Mike Krahulik's posts, which listed links to the Florida Bar Association. Thompson accused \"Penny Arcade\" of soliciting complaints to the Bar against him, even though Krahulik actually posted the opposite, asking fans to cease sending letters to the Bar, as the Bar acknowledged that it is aware of Thompson's actions, thanks to previous letters.\n\nThe Seattle PD eventually acknowledged receiving a complaint from Thompson, but have commented that they believe the issue to be a civil, rather than criminal, matter. They noted that this was from initial impressions of the letter they received, and their criminal investigations bureau is reviewing the letter to make sure that there were not any criminal matters that they missed.\n\nOn the same day, Scott Kurtz, creator of the webcomic \"PvP\" and a longtime friend of Krahulik and Holkins, used the image of the letter Thompson sent to the Seattle PD to create a parody letter in which Jack attempts to enlist the aid of the Justice League of America by claiming Gabe and Tycho to be villains of some description.\n\nThe \"Penny Arcade\" shop had at the time sold an \"I hate Jack Thompson\" T-shirt, claiming that every living creature, including Thompson's own mother, hates Jack Thompson.\n\nOn March 21, 2007 Thompson filed a countersuit to the lawsuit brought against him by Take Two Interactive claiming that they are at the center of a RICO conspiracy. \"Penny Arcade\" was named as one of the co-conspirators. At Sakura-Con 2007, Krahulik announced that the suit had been dropped.\n\nAn August 11, 2010 comic entitled \"The Sixth Slave\" wherein an NPC pleads with a player to save him from being raped nightly by monsters called \"dickwolves\", drew criticism from many commentators, including from \"The American Prospect\" and \"The Boston Phoenix\". Krahulik and Holkins dismissed these criticisms, later selling \"Team Dickwolves\" T-shirts based on the strip. They later removed the \"Team Dickwolves\" shirt from their store due to complaints that it made potential PAX attendees uncomfortable. After the removal, Krahulik posted online that removing the shirts was only partly caving to pressure but mainly due to people who had personally emailed him and were reasonable with their concerns. Krahulik also stated that anyone still hesitant about going to PAX even after removal of the shirts should not come to PAX. In September 2013, on the last day of PAX, Krahulik told a panel that he thought that \"pulling the dickwolves merchandise was a mistake\", to cheers from the crowd. However, Krahulik later apologized on the \"Penny Arcade\" website, stating that he regretted contributing to the furor that had followed the original comic.\n\nBoth critics of the comic strip and Krahulik and Holkins, made claims of receiving verbal abuse through social media and death threats.\n\n\"John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory\" was posted in the \"Penny Arcade\" strip published March 19, 2004. It regards the online disinhibition effect, in which Internet users exhibit unsociable tendencies while interacting with other Internet users. Krahulik and Holkins suggest that, given both anonymity and an audience, an otherwise regular person becomes aggressively antisocial. In 2013, Holkins gave the corollary that \"Normal Person - \"Consequences\" + Audience = Total Fuckwad\".\n\nClay Shirky, an adjunct professor at New York University who studies social and economic effects of Internet technologies, explains: \"There’s a large crowd and you can act out in front of it without paying any personal price to your reputation,” which \"creates conditions most likely to draw out the typical Internet user’s worst impulses.\" In an \"Advocate\" article about online homophobia, this theory was used to account for behavior on online forums where one can remain anonymous in front of an audience: for instance, posting comments on popular YouTube videos.\n\n\nOn December 13, 2006, \"Next Generation Magazine\" rated Krahulik and Holkins among its \"Top 25 People of the Year\". Also appearing on the list were Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime and former Xbox corporate vice-president Peter Moore. Krahulik made a post about the honor, in which he explained that \"Penny Arcade\" was created only because Next Gen rejected the duo's entry to a comic contest many years before. \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed \"Penny Arcade\" on their \"100 Sites to Bookmark Now,\" calling it \"a hilarious and smart webcomic for gamers.\" MTV Online named Holkins and Krahulik two of the world's most influential gamers, saying \"they have become the closest the medium has to leaders of a gamers' movement.\" Time.com named \"Penny Arcade\" as one of its \"50 Best Websites\" for 2008 \"...for the way it pokes fun at the high-tech industry and the people who love it.\"\n1UP.com described it as \"the One True Gaming Webcomic.\" \"Penny Arcade\" was used along with \"American Elf\", \"Fetus-X\", and \"Questionable Content\" as an example of comics using the web to create \"an explosion of diverse genres and styles\" in Scott McCloud's 2006 book \"Making Comics\".\n\nOn March 5, 2009, the Washington State Senate honored Holkins and Krahulik, both originally from Spokane, for the contribution that they had made to the state, the video game industry, and to children's charities from around the world courtesy of their Child's Play initiative. Later in March, \"Penny Arcade\" won the category \"Best Webcomic\" in the fan voted Project Fanboy Awards for 2008.\n\nIn 2010, Holkins, Krahulik, and Khoo were awarded the annual \"Ambassador Award\" at GDC's Game Developers Choice Awards for contributions they had made to the industry. The same year, \"Time\" included Holkins and Krahulik in the annual \"Time 100\", the magazine's listing of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\nIn July 2015, Holkins and Krahulik were recognized as \"Multimedia Empire Builders\" in Ad Week's 10 Visual Artists Changing the Way We See Advertising issue.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1690731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1690731", "title": "Rick Martel", "text": "Rick Martel\n\nRichard Vigneault (born March 18, 1956) is a Canadian retired professional wrestler, trainer, and television presenter, better known by his ring name, Rick Martel. He is best known for his appearances with the American Wrestling Association, the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling. Championships held by Martel over the course of his career include the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, WCW World Television Championship, and WWF World Tag Team Championship.\n\nMartel is from a family of wrestlers, and made his professional debut at age sixteen when his brother Michel, a wrestler, asked him to replace an injured wrestler. Martel was already a skilled amateur wrestler, and quickly adapted to professional wrestling.\n\nMartel wrestled throughout the world, winning titles in Canada (in Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling and Vancouver-based NWA All Star Wrestling), New Zealand and Puerto Rico. His first real success in the United States came in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Portland affiliate, Pacific Northwest Wrestling, where he became a top talent, holding the Canadian and PNW tag team titles simultaneously. He left PNW on August 16, 1980, when he lost a Loser Leaves Town match to Buddy Rose. Martel also served a stint as a booker for a wrestling territory in Hawaii, where he would help the promotion set up matches and construct the storylines that would play out inside and outside of the ring.\n\nMartel debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in July 1980. That fall, he formed a tag team with Tony Garea. On November 8, they defeated The Wild Samoans to capture the WWF Tag Team Championship. They successfully defended the title until dropping the belts to The Moondogs on March 17, 1981. They regained the title from The Moondogs on July 21. Their second reign came to an end on October 13, when they lost to Mr. Fuji and Mr. Saito. Though they would challenge the champions numerous times, Martel and Garea were unable to recapture the belts, and Martel left the WWF in April 1982.\n\nMartel signed with the AWA in 1982 and quickly ascended through the ranks, defeating Jumbo Tsuruta to win the AWA World Heavyweight Championship on May 13, 1984. His reign as champion lasted nearly nineteen months (the third-longest title reign and the longest title reign of the 1980s), during which time he wrestled several matches with NWA World Champion Ric Flair, as well as with Jimmy Garvin, Nick Bockwinkel and King Tonga. His finishing move alternated between the slingshot splash and the combination atomic drop/back suplex. On December 29, 1985, Martel lost the title to Stan Hansen, who forced him to submit to the \"Brazos Valley Backbreaker\" (Hansen's version of the Boston crab).\n\nIn 1986, Martel returned to the WWF, with his tag team partner Tom Zenk. They were billed as The Can-Am Connection. The Can-Am Connection had been formed by Martel in the Montreal-based Lutte Internationale in 1986. Zenk was the boyfriend of Martel's sister-in-law, and had been introduced to Martel in the AWA by Curt Hennig. The Can-Am Connection with their youthful looks and high energy in-ring performances quickly garnered the affection of fans, and they looked likely to win the WWF Tag Team Title in the near future. At WrestleMania III in front of a reported 93,173 fans at the Pontiac Silverdome, The Cam-Am connection defeated Ace Cowboy Bob Orton and The Magnificent Muraco in the opening match, when Martel pinned Muraco with a flying cross-body helped by what commentator Gorilla Monsoon called \"a schoolboy trip from behind\" by Zenk. They split shortly afterward; Zenk claimed Martel had secretly negotiated an individual contract worth three times more than his partner's contract (traditionally, tag teams are paid roughly equal salaries).\n\nMartel strongly disagreed. In \"Mad Dogs, Midgets and Screw Jobs\", he said: “Ever since I had been fired by Jim Barnett, I decided not to discuss money matters with other wrestlers . . . I did the same thing with Tom, and he put it in his head, or some other people put it in his head, that I made more than him. But as far as Vince was concerned,\nif you were in a tag team, you earned the same amount of money.” He also claimed Zenk \"...was overwhelmed by it all... Wrestling is very hard on your body. Hard on you also mentally. It's hard physically. Tom wasn't mentally or physically hard as I thought he would be.\"\n\nAt the time of Zenk's departure, The Can-Am Connection was in a feud with The Islanders (Haku and Tama); Zenk's departure was worked into the feud, with the Islanders claiming that Zenk was a quitter and abandoned Martel because he knew they could never beat them. In July 1987, Martel defeated both Haku and Tama in singles competition. Then on the August 15, 1987 episode of \"Superstars of Wrestling\" after Martel defeated Barry Horowitz, he was jumped by The Islanders. Tito Santana, who was doing commentary in the Spanish broadcast booth, ran to the ring to help Martel fight off his attackers. Martel and Santana then formed a tag team called Strike Force. The team were played off as good looking pretty boys (a storyline that came directly from the Can-Am Connection), even using the theme called \"Girls In Cars\", which was originally made for the Can-Am Connection. The name Strike Force came from Santana's promise that as a team they would, \"be striking (The Islanders) with force.\" Martel immediately came up with the team's name based on this.\n\nAfter winning their feud with The Islanders, Strike Force immediately challenged The Hart Foundation (Bret \"Hitman\" Hart and Jim \"The Anvil\" Neidhart) for the WWF World Tag Team Title. Strike Force won the titles on an episode of \"Superstars\" after Martel made Neidhart submit to a Boston crab. Strike Force would hold the titles for five months, defending primarily against the Hart Foundation and the Islanders, before losing to Demolition (Ax and Smash) at WrestleMania IV in Atlantic City when Smash pinned Martel as a result of Martel being hit on the back of the neck by Ax using Mr. Fuji's cane as a weapon when Martel had Smash in the Boston crab and the referee was distracted by Santana beating up Mr. Fuji on the ring apron.\n\nShortly afterward, Martel (kayfabe) took time off due to injuries sustained in a title rematch against Demolition at a \"Prime Time Wrestling\" taping in Oakland, California on June 1, 1988 (aired July 11). Smash hit Martel with a steel chair, then Demolition performed their \"Demolition Decapitation\" finisher on him at ringside, leaving him unconscious on the floor. On the June 18 \"Superstars\", it was announced he suffered back injuries and a concussion. In the storyline, he briefly retired due to these injuries. In reality, he was granted leave from the WWF and took six months off to help care for his severely ill wife.\n\nMartel returned in January 1989 as a singles wrestler, before reforming Strike Force with Santana at WrestleMania V to face The Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard). During the match, Santana accidentally hit Martel with his signature flying forearm smash and knocked him out of the ring. A frustrated Martel refused to tag in and walked away, leaving Santana to be beaten down and pinned. Immediately after the match in an interview with \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund who asked him how he could leave his partner \"high and dry\" and said that Strike Force was \"supposed to be a team, a team\", an irate Martel said, \"I'm sick and tired. I'm sick and tired of him. You know, I was doing great as a singles wrestler, but no, Mr. Tito wants to ride my coattails some more. You saw his timing was off\". Then angrily addressing Santana he said \"You're lucky that being the gentleman that I am that I just walked off. That could have been a lot worse for you Tito Santana.\"\n\nFollowing his heel turn, Martel acquired Slick as his manager. He feuded with Santana on and off over the next two years, losing to him in the finals of the 1989 King of the Ring tournament, then defeating him at The Main Event IV taping on October 30, 1990 (aired November 23).\nAs 1989 came to a close, Martel's relationship with Slick quietly ended.\n\nIn late 1989, Martel adopted a narcissistic gimmick, as \"The Model\". Just before the 1989 Survivor Series (where in a continuation of their feud, Martel pinned Santana in the opening elimination match of the night), he introduced his own (fictional) brand of cologne called \"Arrogance\", which he carried in a large atomizer and sprayed in the eyes of his opponents to blind them. He wore a turquoise sweater tied around his neck to the ring (later replaced by a turquoise sportcoat), with a large lapel pin that read \"Yes, I am a model.\" Martel made his pay-per-view singles match debut at WrestleMania VI at the Skydome in Toronto, where he defeated Koko B. Ware via submission with his signature Boston Crab.\n\nMartel's most high-profile feud during his stint as \"The Model\" was with Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, sparked when he blinded Roberts with \"Arrogance\" on \"The Brother Love Show\" in October 1990. Martel and Roberts captained opposing teams at the Survivor Series. \"The Visionaries\" (Martel, The Warlord and Power and Glory) defeated The Vipers (Roberts, Superfly Jimmy Snuka and The Rockers) in a 4-0 clean sweep, the first time this had happened in Survivor Series history. In the 1990 Survivor Series (unlike previous editions), the heel survivors faced off against the babyface survivors in a grand final \"Match Of Survival\". There \"The Visionaries\" teamed with \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted Dibiase to face Tito Santana, Hulk Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion The Ultimate Warrior. Martel was eliminated from the match after he got himself counted out by abandoning his team after receiving beatings from both Hogan and The Warrior. Martel continued to have the upper hand in the 1991 Royal Rumble match, eliminating Roberts from the match en route to lasting (a then-record) 53 minutes, before being eliminated by The British Bulldog. Roberts would ultimately get his revenge at WrestleMania VII, defeating Martel in a blindfold match. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the blindfold match in which both wrestlers wore black hoods and could not see (though Roberts later admitted that they did have limited vision due to the lighting), it was rated as one of the poorer Wrestlemania matches. For the rest of 1991, Martel represented the WWF on Japanese tours for Super World Sports. In December 1991, he lost to Naoki Sano in a match to determine the inaugural SWS Junior Heavyweight Champion.\n\nIn early 1992, Martel began a feud with Tatanka, leading to WrestleMania VIII, where Tatanka pinned him.\n\nThat summer, Martel had a brief feud with Shawn Michaels, as both men sought the affections of Sensational Sherri. The feud ended with a chain of events that resulted in a double countout at SummerSlam 1992 held at the Wembley Stadium in London, England in front of what remains the SummerSlam record attendance of 80,355. The match carried a \"no punching in the face\" stipulation, mutually agreed upon and eventually disregarded by the two narcissistic heels.\n\nMartel then resumed his rivalry with Tatanka by stealing his sacred eagle feathers, to add to his wardrobe. The feud was resolved at the 1992 Survivor Series, where Tatanka again defeated Martel and reclaimed the feathers.\n\nBy 1993, Martel mainly appeared on the lower undercard, and rarely on television, mostly on programs such as \"All-American Wrestling\" and \"Wrestling Challenge\". However, at the September 27 \"Monday Night Raw\" taping, he was the co-winner (with Razor Ramon) of a battle royal (aired October 4) to decide the competitors in a match for the vacant Intercontinental Championship. He lost that match (aired the next week) to Ramon. After this, Martel began moving slightly up the card once again. Martel also briefly feuded with Bastion Booger, losing one of their matches when he got fed up with how Booger smelled and started spraying him with his \"Arrogance\" cologne. Martel also appeared at \"Survivor Series 1993\" in a 4-4 elimination match, being eliminated by The 1-2-3 Kid and in the \"1994 Royal Rumble\" as the 26th entrant before getting eliminated by his old rival Tatanka. Martel was set to appear in a ten-man tag team match at \"Wrestlemania X\" but the match was cancelled during the show due to the show running out of time. The match was later held on \"RAW\", with Martel's team victorious.\n\nBy the summer of 1994, Martel dropped out of the WWF picture and would not be seen again until participating in the 1995 Royal Rumble (he was a substitute for Jim Neidhart). Martel's final appearance came the following month at a house show in Montreal, as his wrestling career began to slow as Martel pursued a career in real estate.\n\nIn a shoot interview with RF video, Martel claimed that he and Don Callis were set to return to the WWF as 'The Supermodels' in 1997, before Callis turned on Martel, turning him face for the first time since 1989. However, after a pay dispute with WWF owner Vince McMahon, Martel signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Callis confirmed that he and Martel were set to debut as a team during an interview with WWE.com in 2015.\n\nMartel debuted for WCW in 1997, feuding with Booker T for the World Television Championship and winning it on the February 16, 1998 \"Nitro\". Martel's comeback was cut short during his rematch with Booker T at SuperBrawl VIII on February 22, when he landed badly on a throw, hitting his leg on one of the ring ropes. He tore an inside ligament of his right knee, fractured his leg and suffered cartilage damage, effectively ending his in-ring career. He was originally booked to retain the Television Title in the match, intended to be a gauntlet match, by beating Booker and then Perry Saturn. Martel and Booker worked out a finish in the ring (by which Martel suffered a further injury after a botched Harlem Sidekick), and then Booker and Saturn worked the second half of the match entirely on the fly. Martel was out of action for several months.\n\nAfter suffering another injury in his first match back (on the July 13 episode of \"Nitro\", against Booker T's Harlem Heat tag team partner (and real life older brother), Stevie Ray), Martel retired from the ring.\n\nAfter retiring from the ring, Martel worked for WCW as a trainer, and as host of the French versions of WCW programming.\n\nAfter the main event of a house show in Quebec City on May 3, 2003, then WWE Champion Brock Lesnar introduced Martel to the ring as a surprise, and shook his hand. Martel, who received a standing ovation from his home fans, said he was honoured to be associated with WWE and thanked the fans.\n\nAt WWE's pay-per-view in 2007, Martel, along with his former teammate Tony Garea, saved Jimmy Snuka and Sgt. Slaughter from a post-match attack at the hands of Deuce 'n Domino.\n\nMartel is a playable character in \"WWE 2K18\" and \"WWE 2K19\", the first video game appearance since 1993's Sega Mega drive/Genesis version of \"WWF Royal Rumble\".\n\n\n"}

The Libraries serve Smithsonian Institution staff as well as the scholarly community and general public with information and reference support. Its collections number over 1.5 million volumes including 40,000 rare books and 2,000 manuscripts. The Libraries also holds the United States' largest trade literature collection, which includes over 300,000 commercial catalogs dating from the early nineteenth century and representing more than 30,000 companies.\n\nThe Libraries' collections focus primarily on science, art, history and culture, and museology. SIL is continuously analyzing its mission and goals in order to best meet the information and knowledge needs of new generations of users, to strengthen research, and to reach through cyberspace those unable to visit the Smithsonian museums and research centers in person.\n\nThe shared SIL Catalog is part of the Smithsonian Research Information System (SIRIS) from which one can search 1.89 million records of text, images, video and sound files from across the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nIn 2008, SIL celebrated its 40th anniversary. Nancy E. Gwinn, Ph.D., was named director in 1997.\n\nThe original library was founded by an Act of Congress on August 10, 1846, when the Smithsonian Institution was named a trust instrumentality of the United States. The Act created a Board of Regents for the Institution, and called for a building to house a museum with geological and mineralogical cabinets, a chemical laboratory, a gallery of art, lecture rooms, and a library.\n\nThe Smithsonian Libraries system as it exists today was not established until 1968, when Secretary S. Dillon Ripley realized that the existing library organization was greatly in need of an overhaul. He created a new position, Director of the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, and hired Russell Shank to fill the role. Shank reorganized the library staff and procedures, and created a modern, unified system with central services and a union catalog. By 1977, when Shank left, the quality and research value of the scientific collections were recognized nationally, and SIL was invited to join the Association of Research Libraries. SIL was granted a seat on the executive board of the Federal Libraries and Information Centers Coordinating Committee. \n\nThe late 1970s and 1980s also saw a growth in the number of Smithsonian Libraries branches, brought about by a range of donations to the Institution. In 1976, ten thousand rare scientific books and manuscripts were gifted to the Smithsonian by the Burndy Library, prompting the creation of the Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology under the Smithsonian umbrella. Several years later, large donations of artifact collections led to the formation of new museums for subjects such as African art, American Indian culture and postal history and a new library branch was subsequently formed for each of these as well.\n\nThe 1990s introduced an expansion of the Libraries' focus to improve their ability to reach and educate the general public. The introduction of electronic and Internet technology played a large role in spurring this new outreach endeavor. In 1999, under the leadership of director Robert Maloy, Smithsonian Libraries staff completed a fourteen-year long effort to create a public access online catalog, with 97 percent of their then-holdings gaining digital records.\n\nIn March 2013, the Smithsonian Institution Libraries formally changed its name to Smithsonian Libraries \"to simplify and strengthen the Libraries as part of an overall rebranding in the modern era\".\n\n\n\n\nThe collections held by the Libraries reflect the various disciplines and scholarly pursuits of the curators and researchers of the Smithsonian Institution. Strengths in the collections include the following areas: \n\n\nMost of the Smithsonian Libraries are located in the Washington, D.C., area, where most of the Smithsonian Institution's museums and research centers are. Other locations include New York City, Suitland, Md., Edgewater, Md., and the Republic of Panama.C\n\nAmerican art, portraiture, American history and biography, and American crafts.\n\nSupports work on history and culture of the African diaspora in the DC area and more broadly in the Western hemisphere. Subjects include Upper South, African American women, slavery and abolitionism, and religion and the African American community. It houses some library materials from the National Museum of African American History and Culture while the museum is under construction.\n\nPlant systematics, botanical history, ethnobotany, botanical art/design/illustration, floriculture, arboriculture, integrated pest management, gardening, plantscaping, etc.\n\nDesign and decorative art from the Renaissance to the present.\n\nArtistic traditions/cultures of the peoples of Asia. Chinese and Japanese art represent about half of the collection.\n\nModern and contemporary art, including painting, sculpture, drawings, prints, photography, video, and emerging art forms.\n\nPhysical anthropology, archaeology, cultural anthropology, linguistics, forensic science, area studies.\n\nCollections storage, research, and conservation.\n\nSpace and aviation history, air transport, astronomy/astrophysics, terrestrial and exogeology, remote sensing, spacecraft design and instrumentation, etc.\n\nHistory of technology, all aspects of American history—social, cultural, political, and economic, history of everyday American life, etc.\n\nGeneral science, biology, ecology, evolution, biodiversity, geology, paleontology, conservation, etc. Includes sub-branches/satellite libraries in Invertebrate and Vertebrate Zoology, Mineral Sciences, Paleobiology.\n\nPostal and philatelic history.\n\nVeterinary medicine, pathology, genetics, nutrition, behavior, husbandry, wildlife conservation, biodiversity, zoo and aquarium horticulture.\n\nGlobal change, population and community ecology, coastal ecosystems. Emphasis on Chesapeake Bay area.\nTropical biology, ecology, conservation, pharmacognosy, ecotourism, etc.\nMain site is in Panama City; branches in research stations on Barro Colorado Island on Gatun Lake, and on Colón Island, Bocas del Toro Province.\nAll aspects of American Indian history and cultures, including architecture, health, law, education, music, dancing, religion, languages and literatures, Pow-wows, etc.\n\nAfrican visual arts, including architecture, painting, sculpture, prints, pottery, textiles, popular culture, photography, rock art.\n\nWhile all Smithsonian libraries hold some special collections material, two libraries comprise the Special Collections Department which is primarily dedicated to that purpose. According to its mission statement, \"The Special Collections Department arranges, describes, houses, and provides access to the rare books, manuscripts, and special collections held in the two dedicated special collections libraries of Smithsonian Institution Libraries.\" Access is provided to Smithsonian Institution curators, researchers, and other staff as well as outside scholars by appointment.\n\nThe Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology contains 35,000 books and 2,000 manuscripts related to the history of science and technology. Established in 1976 with a donation from Bern Dibner, the Dibner Library is housed in the National Museum of American History.\n\nThe Cullman Library of Natural History holds some 10,000 volumes published before 1840 in the fields of anthropology and natural sciences. The Cullman Library is also located at the National Museum of Natural History.\n\nAdditionally, the National Air and Space Museum Library features special collections housed in both the Dewitt Clinton Ramsey Room and the Aerospace Legacy Materials Collection Gift Collection (ALM Collection). Located in the National Air and Space Museum's Mall location, the Dewitt Clinton Ramsey Room houses rare books, serials, oral histories, vertical files, and the Bella Landauer Collection of sheet music. Housed in the Smithsonian Institution Libraries’ Research Annex in Landover, MD, the ALM Collection is a growing body of largely grey literature in the form of government manuals, reports, studies, and surveys capturing the history and evolution of civil aviation..\n\nDigital initiatives are conducted by cross-disciplinary teams that include staff from Digital Services, Metadata/Cataloging, Reader Services, and other Libraries departments. They include publications, images, collections and objects such as online exhibits, webcasts, finding aids, digital versions of print editions, bibliographies, etc.\n\n\n\nMacaw (metadata software) is an open-source metadata collection tool written by J.

After a term sheet has been \"executed\", it guides legal counsel in the preparation of a proposed \"final agreement\". It then guides, but is not necessarily binding, as the signatories negotiate, usually with legal counsel, the final terms of their agreement.\n\nA term sheet implies the conditions of a business transaction, as proposed by a party. It may be either binding or non-binding.\n\nTerm sheets are very similar to \"letters of intent\" (LOI) in that they are both preliminary, mostly non-binding documents meant to record two or more parties' intentions to enter into a future agreement based on specified (but incomplete or preliminary) terms. The difference between the two is slight and mostly a matter of style: an LOI is typically written in letter form and focuses on the parties' intentions; a term sheet skips most of the formalities and lists deal terms in bullet-point or similar format. There is an implication that an LOI only refers to the final form. A term sheet may be a proposal, not an agreed-to document.\n\nWithin the context of venture capital financing, a term sheet typically includes conditions for financing a startup company. The key offering terms in such a term sheet include (a) amount raised, (b) price per share, (c) pre-money valuation, (d) liquidation preference, (e) voting rights, (f) anti-dilution provisions, and (g) registration rights.\n\nIt is customary to begin the negotiation of a venture investment with the circulation of a term sheet, which is a summary of the terms the proposer (the issuer, the investor, or an intermediary) is prepared to accept. The term sheet is analogous to a letter of intent, a nonbinding outline of the principal points which the stock purchase agreement and related agreements will cover in detail.\n\nThe advantage of the abbreviated term sheet format is, first, that it expedites the process. Experienced counsel immediately know generally what is meant when the term sheet specifies \"one demand registration at the issuer's expense, unlimited piggybacks at the issuer's expense, weighted average antidilution\"; it saves time not to have to spell out the long-form edition of those references. Second, since the term sheet does not propose to be an agreement of any sort, it is less likely that a court will find unexpected promissory content; a \"letter of intent\" can be a dangerous document unless it specifies very clearly, as it should, which portions are meant to be binding and which merely guide the discussion and drafting. Some portions of a term sheet can have binding effect, of course, if and to the extent an interlocutory memorialization is needed of some binding promises, that is, confidentiality of the disclosures made in the negotiation. The summary format of a term sheet, however, makes it less likely that any party will be misled into thinking that some form of enforceable agreement has been memorialized when it has not.\n\nSome important terms to founders and venture capitalists: \n\n"}

It was originally conceived and written by Percy Scholes and published in 1938. Since then, it has undergone two distinct rewritings: one by Denis Arnold, in 1983, and the latest edition by Alison Latham in 2002. It is \"arguably the most successful book on music ever produced\" (Wright, p. 99).\n\nThe first edition, a single-volume work, was produced in 1938, edited by Percy Scholes, and was written almost entirely by him alone.\n\nThe second edition, published 1939 includes a 64-page categorised \"List of books about music in the English language\" by Scholes.\n\nWherever possible, Scholes tried to use primary source material, rather than summarizing other people's work. His preface to the First Edition describes how he played and read through thousands of sheets of music, as well as reading thousands of concert programs and studying \"old literature and long-bygone musical journals\". From this research, he produced about fifty-five volumes of notes. Each of these was devoted to a separate branch of musical knowledge. He then sought peer review of each of these volumes with specialists in the particular branch of musical knowledge. Finally, these volumes were broken up and re-constituted in alphabetical order.\n\nScholes' intention was to produce a work relevant to a wide range of readers, from the professional musician to the concert-goer, \"gramaphonist\", or radio-listener. His work was aimed at a reader for whom it \"will neither be beyond the scope of his pocket nor embarrass him by a manner of expression so technical as to add new puzzles to the puzzle which sent him to the book\". The result was a work which was highly accessible to the general reader, as well as being useful for the specialist.\n\nWhile scholarly and well-researched, Scholes' style was also sometimes quirky and opinionated. For instance, his original articles on some of the twentieth-century composers were highly dismissive, as were his articles on genres such as jazz. His entry on the can-can concluded \"Its exact nature is unknown to anyone connected with this Companion.\"\n\nHe produced several revisions prior to his death (in 1958), with the last full revision being the 9th edition in 1955. The Tenth Edition, published in 1970, was a revision of Scholes' work by John Owen Ward. Ward considered it \"inappropriate to change radically the characteristic rich anecdotal quality of Dr. Scholes' style.\" Although he brought some of the articles up to date, he left much of Scholes' distinctive work intact.\n\nA distinctive feature of this Companion is a series of \"imaginative\" portraits of composers created by the artist Oswald Barrett (known as \"Batt\"). These consist of engravings (Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Byrd, Chopin, Elgar, Handel, Haydn, Liszt, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner), and a frontispiece which is a colour reproduction of an oil painting of \"Beethoven in Middle Life\", described by Scholes as \"the artist's personal gift to the volume\" (see the Preface to the First Edition).\n\nIn 1983 a wholly revised two-volume work, titled \"The New Oxford Companion to Music,\" was introduced. This was edited by Denis Arnold who made extensive use of other specialist contributors, some 90 in all. The work was significantly broader in coverage than Scholes' original (there was for instance a perceptive article on Bob Dylan), and is the most extensively illustrated of the three versions.\n\nArnold expressed his intention of adhering to Scholes’ principles and indeed included much of Scholes’ material in the new work. Nevertheless, he cut out much of the personal opinion and quirkiness which was characteristic of the original. For instance, he substantially increased the coverage of female composers and performers, who were almost totally absent from Scholes' work.\n\nThere were no further revisions of this version, probably due to its relative unpopularity and Arnold's own early death in 1986.\n\nIn 2002, a third work was produced. This one, edited by Alison Latham, goes back to the original title and to the single-volume format.\n\nLatham assembled her own team of over 120 contributors, some of whom had contributed to the prior (Arnold) edition, and others drawn from her own previous editing work (for example on the \"Grove Concise Dictionary of Music\"). This edition consists of some 7400 articles and aims to bring the work up-to-date: for example, in its coverage of areas such as electronic music and computers.\n\nThe 2002 revision is more current, handier and more affordable than its predecessor. However, it abridges the text and eliminates most of the illustrations.\n\nThe text of the 2002 edition can be accessed online via Oxford Music Online, which is also a portal for The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. As well as being available to individual and educational subscribers, it is available for use by members of many libraries worldwide.\n\n"}

Collectively, Xuanying's 25-chapter and Huilin's 100-chapter versions constitute the oldest surviving Chinese dictionary of Buddhist technical terminology (for instance, \"Púsà\" 菩薩 or \"Pútísàtuo\" 菩提薩埵 for \"Bodhisattva\"). A recent history of Chinese lexicography (Yong and Peng 2008: 371) call Huilin's \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" \"a composite collection of all the glossaries of scripture words and expressions compiled in and before the Tang Dynasty\" and \"the archetype of the Chinese bilingual dictionary\".\n\nThe dictionary title combines three Chinese words:\nThe term \"yīqièjīng\" 一切經 \"all the sutras; complete Buddhist canon; Tripiṭaka\" first came into use in the Sui dynasty (581-618), also known as the \"Dàzàngjīng\" 大藏經, referring to all the classic scriptures or the entire Buddhist canon (Yong and Peng 2008: 219). The term \"yīnyì\" 音義 \"pronunciation and meaning\", which refers to explaining the phonology and semantics of words, originated in the exegesis of Chinese classics. The Three Kingdoms (220-280) scholar Sun Yan 孫炎 used it in his commentary title \"Erya yinyi\" 爾雅音義 \"Pronunciation and Meaning in the \"Erya\"\".\n\nThere is no regular English translation of \"Yiqiejing yinyi\", compare these renderings:\n\nAlternate \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" titles include the \"Dazang yinyi\" 大藏音義 \"Pronunciation and Meaning in the \"Tripiṭaka\"\", and to distinguish it from Xuanying's version, the \"Huilin yinyi\" 慧琳音義 \"Huilin's Pronunciation and Meaning\".\n\nThere is more biographical information available for the Kashgar monk Huilin (733-817) than his predecessor Xuanying (d. c. 661). \n\nThe (988) \"Song gaoseng zhuan\" 宋高僧傳 \"Biographies of Eminent Song Dynasty Monks\" gives a detailed record. Huilin's surname was Pei 裴, and he was born in \"Shule\" 疏勒 \"Kashgar\" (a city-state in the Tarim Basin, present-day \"Kashi\" 喀什, Xinjiang, the westernmost city in China) (Guang 2012: 235). Huilin was a disciple of Master Bukong 不空 or Amoghavajra (705-744), one of the Eight Patriarchs in Shingon Buddhism. He was a monk at the Xi Ming Temple in Chang'an (present-day Xi'an, Shanxi, at the eastern terminus of the Silk Road). Huilin \"inwardly strictly observes the regulations and outwardly studies the Confucian Classics. He has a profound knowledge of Indian philology and exegetic studies\" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 220).\n\nThe Chinese Dharma name Huilin 慧琳 (lit. \"Wisdom Gem\") was first used by another Buddhist monk. Huilin 慧琳 (fl. 421-445), who was favored by Emperor Wen of Liu Song, wrote the controversial (443) \"Baihei lun\" 白黑論 \"Discourse on White and Black\" that expressed doubts about karmic retribution.\n\nIn the history of Chinese lexicography, Hulin's \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" was an early Buddhist \"yinyi\" \"pronunciation and meaning\" dictionary. This genre originated when Buddhism became a popular Chinese religion in the period between the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 CE) and Tang dynasty (618-907). For example, the Northern Qi (550-577) Buddhist monk Daohui 道慧 compiled the \"Yiqiejing yin\" 一切經音 \"Pronunciation in the Complete Buddhist Canon\", which did not gloss meanings.\n\nEarly translators, including both Central Asian Buddhist missionaries and Chinese monks, often had difficulties accurately rendering Buddhist terminology from Sanskrit, Pali, and Middle Indo-Aryan languages into written Chinese (Chien and Creamer 1986: 35). The wide variety of methods, source texts, and exegetical strategies used by different translators of Buddhist texts in the Southern and Northern dynasties period (420-589) gave rise to a large number of neologisms and repurposed Chinese terms (Clart and Scott 2015: 125). For instance, Sanskrit \"nirvana\" is usually transcribed with the Chinese characters \"nièpán\" < Middle Chinese \"ngetban\" 涅槃 (Baxter and Sagart 2014), but also had alternate phonetic transcriptions such as \"nièpánnà\" < \"ngetbannop\" 涅槃那, and a similarly pronounced term from Daoist internal alchemy \"níwán\" < \"nejhwan\" 泥丸 (\"muddy pellet; one of the Nine Palaces in the head\"). With more and more Indian and Central Asian texts being translated into Chinese, the use of Sanskrit and Middle Indo-Aryan transcriptions and technical vocabulary increased, and became progressively more difficult to comprehend. Meanwhile, errors occurred in the copying and circulation of the scriptures, which the scholar of Buddhism Liu Yu 柳豫 describes: \nThe Buddhist scriptures are voluminous and the argumentations in them are profound. They are afflicted with errors and misspellings, and their phonetic notations and semantic interpretations are often rough and neglectful. Days and months are spent in studying and sorting them. There is some progress, but concerns are inevitable. Reflections on them often come to nothing. All the scholars of good will would be troubled by them. (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 207)\nXuanying's purpose in writing the original \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" was to standardize the diverse Chinese Buddhist technical terminology used in the Buddhist canon, gloss correct pronunciation, note variant transcriptions, and give semantic explanations. \n\nHuilin started to compile the \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" in 788 and finished it in 810 (or, according to another account, started in 783 and finished in 807) (Yong and Peng 2008: 220). The text has two prefaces by Tang scholars, one written by the monk Gu Qizhi 顧齊之 and one by the poet Jing Fan 景審 (Theobald 2011). The preface says Huilin's wordbook \"is as vast as the sea, embracing numerous streams and therefore profound, and is as bright as a mirror, reflecting tirelessly the objects in the world\" (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 222). In 851, during the reign of Emperor Xuānzong of Tang, Huilin's book was officially included into the Buddhist Canon.\n\nHuilin's dictionary was supplemented by the (987) \"Xu yiqiejing yinyi\" 續一切経音義 \"Extended Pronunciation and Meaning in the Complete Buddhist Canon\", compiled by the Liao dynasty monk Xilin 希麟. This 10-chapter dictionary had entries taken from 226 Buddhist scriptures. Each entry gave the phonetic notation, definition, and citations from dictionaries, rime dictionaries, histories, and other classic literature (Yong and Peng 2008: 220). In addition to their value in establishing the Chinese interpretation of Buddhist technical terms, these \"pronunciation and meaning\" glossaries also serve as important sources for studying the Chinese phonology of their times (Buswell and Lopez 2013: 1031).\n\nCopies of the \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" were later transmitted to Korea and Japan. In 1737, it was first printed in Japan, and those copies were reprinted by Qing dynasty scholars (Theobald 2011). The Japanese (1924-1934) \"Taishō Tripiṭaka\" edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon included the \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" (T 54, no. 2128).\n\nHuilin spent over 20 years editing the \"Yiqiejing yinyi\", and the resultant dictionary is huge. It comprises 100 chapters/volumes (\"juan\" 卷), with a total of about 600,000 characters. There are 31,000 headword entries for difficult terms excerpted from over 1,300 different Buddhist scriptures (Yong and Peng 2008: 220). \n\nHuilin compiled his magnum opus as an expanded version of Xuanying's (c. 649) \"Yiqiejing yinyi\". He incorporated all of Xuanying's definitions, with some corrections (Buswell and Lopez 2013: 1031). For the collation of entries, Huilin copied Xuanying's arrangement by provenance in individual scripture, which in turn was copied from Lu Deming's (583) \"Jingdian Shiwen\" exegetical dictionary of the Confucian Thirteen Classics. At the beginning of each chapter, Huilin listed the sutras and chapters from which the headwords are selected. This user-unfriendly method of collating headwords is comparable to the (c. 800) \"Leiden Glossary\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 370).\n\nEach \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" entry first gives any variant transcriptions of the headword, the \"fanqie\" pronunciation of rare or difficult characters, Chinese translation, and comments (Buswell and Lopez 2013: 1030). The entry for \"wúfù\" < Middle Chinese \"mjubjuwH\" 無復 \"never again\" (Sanskrit \"apunar\" \"not again; only once\"; Muller 2005) exemplifies Huilin's use of \"fanqie\" 反切 glosses for pronunciation.\n無復 [\"wúfù\" < \"mju-bjuwH\"]: The second character in the Wú 吳 pronunciation is 扶救切 [\"b(ju)\" + \"(k)juwH\" = \"bjuwH\"]; in the Qín 秦 pronunciation it is 切 [\"b(juwng)\" + \"(m)juwk\" = \"bjuwk\"]. (tr. Baxter 1992: 319) \nThe Tang period states of Wu and Qin correspond to present day Jiangsu-Zhejiang and Shaanxi.\n\nHuilin's preface says the pronunciation glosses were based on \"Qinyun\" 秦韻 \"Qin pronunciation\", that is, the koiné language spoken in the capital Chang'an. Pronunciations in the (c. 807) \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" document diachronic simplification in Chinese phonology, and more closely correlate with the 106 rimes of the (c. 780) \"Yunhai jingyuan\" rime dictionary than the 193 of the (601) \"Qieyun\" (Malmqvist 2010: 159).\n\nIn order to explain the pronunciations and meanings of difficult words used in Buddhist scriptures, Huilin cited from over 750 lexicographical and commentarial works, including rime dictionaries, Chinese character dictionaries, \"yinyi\" commentaries to Buddhist scriptures, and commentaries to the Chinese classics. Many of these are now lost, but have been partly reconstructed on the basis of Huilin's \"ample and carefully attributed\" quotations (Harbsmeier 1998: 78).\n\nFirst, Huilin cited early rime dictionaries, such as the \"Yunquian\" 韻詮 \"Rime Interpretation\", \"Yunying\" 韻英 \"Rime Essentials\", and \"Kaosheng qieyun\" 考聲切韻 \"Examining Pronunciation in the \"Qieyun\"\". These three exemplify the numerous lost works that were primarily reassembled from \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" citations.\n\nSecond, the \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" quotes linguistic information from Chinese dictionaries and glossaries. Some are familiar lexicons like the \"Shuowen Jiezi\", \"Yupian\", and \"Zilin\"; others are little known like the \"Zitong\" 字統 \"All Characters\", \"Gujin zhengzi\" 古今正字 \"The Rectification of Ancient and Contemporary Characters\", and \"Kaiyuan yinyi\" 開元音義 \"Pronunciations and Meanings of Kaiyuan [era 713-741] Characters\".\n\nThird, Huilin cited from phonetic-semantic commentaries for Buddhist sutras, such as Huiyuan's \"Huayanjing shu\" 華嚴經疏 \"Commentary to the Garland Sutra\", and Kuiji's \"Miàofǎ liánhuá jīng yīnyì\" 妙法蓮華經音義 \"Pronunciation and Meaning in the \"Lotus Sutra\"\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 219). Hulin's dictionary was the first to comment on many Buddhist works.\n\nFourth, when Buddhist terminology was not included previous dictionaries or commentaries, Huilin quoted commentaries for the Chinese classics, both Confucian and Daoist. For instance, Zheng Zhong's commentary to the \"Kaogongji\", Jia Kui's (賈逵, 30-101) to the \"Guoyu\", Xu Shen's commentary to the \"Huainanzi\", and Sima Biao's to the \"Zhuangzi\".\n\nThe \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" is not strictly a bilingual dictionary in the modern meaning of Sanskrit headwords and Chinese translation equivalents, it is technically a monolingual dictionary of Chinese Buddhist terms. Although early \"yinyi\" glossaries and dictionaries have some basic features of modern bilingual dictionaries, they can be considered as the \"most distant forerunners of modern Chinese bilingual dictionaries\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 371). \n\nWithin the Chinese \"pronunciation and meaning\" tradition, Huilin's \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" became the definitive glossary (Buswell and Lopez 2013: 1030). Scholars value it for having accurately recorded the pronunciations and understandings of Buddhist technical terms during the Tang dynasty. Yong and Peng (2008: 220) call it a \"huge masterpiece of notation and interpretation of the sounds and meanings of characters in Buddhist scriptures – exhaustively embracing the ancient exegetic interpretations, phonetically notating the Sanskrit classics – and it is broad in collection and rich in content\".\n\nHuilin's \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" is valuable for three reasons. It is extremely useful for studying Buddhist scriptures. It is significant to exegesis for providing the pronunciations and meanings of ancient words. And it is the main sourcebook for textual reconstructions, citing many classic works that would otherwise be unknown (Guang 2012: 235). According to the Qing scholar of Buddhism Yang Shoujing 楊守敬 (1835-1915) (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 222), Huilin's \"Yiqiejing yinyi\" \"is where philological studies reside and a diamond in the academic forest\".\n\n\n"}
