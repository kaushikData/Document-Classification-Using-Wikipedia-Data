{"id": "3083330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3083330", "title": "A Cock and Bull Story", "text": "A Cock and Bull Story\n\nA Cock and Bull Story (marketed in Australia, New Zealand and the United States as Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story) is a 2005 British comedy film directed by Michael Winterbottom. It is a film-within-a-film, featuring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing themselves as egotistical actors during the making of a screen adaptation of Laurence Sterne's 18th century metafictional novel \"Tristram Shandy\". Gillian Anderson and Keeley Hawes also play themselves in addition to their \"Tristram Shandy\" roles. Since the book is about a man attempting but failing to write his autobiography, the film takes the form of being about failing to make the film.\n\nThe film depicts Steve Coogan playing himself as an arrogant actor with low self-esteem and a complicated love life. Coogan is playing the eponymous role in an adaptation of \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" being filmed at a stately home. He constantly spars with actor Rob Brydon, who is playing Uncle Toby and believes his role to be of equal importance to Coogan's, calling himself the \"co-lead\".\n\nThe film incorporates several sequences from \"Tristram Shandy\". Not all of these are part of the film-within-the-film. The latter are limited to the story of Tristram's conception, birth and christening; Uncle Toby's experiences at the Battle of Namur and Tristram's sudden and accidental circumcision at the age of three. Uncle Toby's wooing of Widow Wadman (Gillian Anderson) takes place in a sequence dreamed by Steve Coogan and after the cast and crew have viewed the \"completed\" film ending, with Walter Shandy fainting at the sight of his wife giving birth, the question \"How does the book end?\" is followed by the concluding scene of the novel, in which Yorick says \"It is a story about a Cock and a Bull – and the best of its kind that ever I heard!\" Yorick is not in the film-within-the-film; in this scene he is played by Stephen Fry, who appears elsewhere in the film as Patrick, a caricatured version of the actual curator at Shandy Hall. The DVD extras include a scene of Fry talking with the curator he portrays.\n\nThe film's soundtrack is notable for featuring numerous excerpts from Nino Rota's score for the Federico Fellini film \"8½\", itself a self-reflexive work about the making of a film. Other non-diegetic musical references are made to \"Amarcord\", \"The Draughtsman's Contract\", \"Smiles of a Summer Night\", \"Fanny and Alexander\" and \"Barry Lyndon\". Michael Nyman, composer of \"The Draughtsman's Contract\" provides a new arrangement of the Handel Sarabande featured in the latter film, while the tracks of \"The Draughtsman's Contract\" (the original soundtrack recordings, the score has been re-recorded numerous times) serve as a temp track to film of the Sterne material.\n\nThe film was recorded at a number of locations in England:\n\nThe film has received very positive reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 90% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 127 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon add madcap, knowing performances to the mix, and the result is a fun, postmodern romp.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"A Cock and Bull Story\" was released on both Region 1 and Region 2 DVD in July 2006.\n\nThe fictionalised versions of Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon seen in the film reappear as the central characters in Michael Winterbottom's 2010 BBC series \"The Trip\".\n\n"}

He matriculated from Balliol College but won a scholarship at Lincoln College in 1876. He read Greats and graduated with a First in 1879. \n\nHe was elected to a Fellowship at Lincoln College in 1880 and ordained in 1884. He was Chaplain of Lincoln and vicar of two Oxford churches, All Saints and St Michael at the North Gate. In 1894 he took up the position of parish priest in Great Leighs, Essex, held in the patronage of Lincoln College.\n\nWhen in Oxford Clark began editing numerous works for the Oxford Historical Society, including four volumes of the \"Register of the University of Oxford\" (1887–89), three volumes of Anthony Wood's \"History of the City of Oxford\" (1889–99) and five volumes of the \"Life and Times of Anthony Wood\" (1891-1900); and then six volumes for the Early English Text Society, the \"English Register of Godstow Nunnery\" (1905–11), the \"English Register of Oseney Abbey\" (1907-13) and \"Lincoln Diocese Documents\" (1914). His two volumes of \"Aubrey's Brief Lives\" (1898) were a scholarly (but censored) edition. It was, no doubt, his deep experience of the writings of Aubrey and Wood that led him to appreciate the importance of popular belief, gossip and hearsay, and prompted his greatest work in chronicling the sensation of living through the Great War in Essex.\n\nAlthough he was absent in Oxford when war was declared in 1914, he decided to keep a detailed diary of \"Echoes of the Great War\" in his village. The diary records the sights and sounds of the war in rural Essex, the activities of Clark's friends, relatives and acquaintances, and rumours relating to the war. The full diary (extending beyond the end of the war) runs to 92 volumes, and is held in the Bodleian Library, Oxford: a condensed version was published by James Munson as \"Echoes of the Great War\" (OUP, 1985). Extracts from the diaries relating to those commemorated on the Great Leighs War Memorial are available via the external link below.\n\nIn addition to his diary, Clark kept clippings during the war under the title 'English Words In Wartime', which are also held (along with other records sent by Clark) in the Bodleian. In addition to his volumes of historical records he also published and some original books, such as \"The Colleges of Oxford\" (1891), \"Lincoln\" (College Histories, 1898), and \"A Bodleian Guide for Visitors\" (1906). Clark was a contributor to the \"Essex Review\".\n\nEdited volumes of Wood's \"Antiquities of the City of Oxford\" (1889–99)\n\n\nClark's contributions to the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" included:\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1999 by Rachel Levitsky as a reading series at Bluestockings in New York, NY. The reading series quickly expanded to a matrix of readings, publications, and informal salons, featuring avant-garde feminist writing, with an emphasis on hybrid and language-focused writing. Currently, the press operates as a non-hierarchical collaborative, publishing books and hosting literary events with attention to diversity in its roster of authors and editorial board.\n\nBelladonna* was started as a reading and salon series at Bluestockings (bookstore) on New York City’s Lower East Side in August 1999. The first publications were postcards by kari edwards for the May 4, 2000 reading at Bluestockings (bookstore). Following the edwards postcards, and in collaboration with Boog Literature, Belladonna* began to publish commemorative \"chaplets\" (staple-bound pamphlets typically with fewer pages than a chapbook, produced in very small print runs) of its readers' work.\n\nIn 2006 Belladonna* published chapbooks by Erica Hunt and Akilah Oliver and co-published its first full-length book, \"Four from Japan: Contemporary Poetry & Essays by Women\", in collaboration with Litmus Press. The following year, Belladonna* published its first full-length books independently: \"Open Box\" by Carla Harryman and \"Mauve Sea-Orchids\", a book of poems in Spanish and English with facing page translations, by Lila Zemborain (translated by Rosa Alcalá and Mónica de la Torre). In celebration of its ten-year anniversary in 2009, Belladonna* published The Elders Series—eight multiply authored perfect-bound books highlighting the continuity and transformation of the ideas, poetics, and artistic/political concerns of its poets' circle. Each book was conceived as \"an anthology and a conversation between the guest curator and the elder(s) she hosts.\" Since 2009, Belladonna* has published, on average, two full-length books and 14 chaplets a year.\n\nIn 2009, \"Bharat Jiva\" by kari edwards (co-published with Litmus Press) was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award in Transgender Literature. Erica Doyle's \"Proxy\" was a 2013 finalist for the Lambda Literary Award in Lesbian Poetry and a winner of the Poetry Society of America's Norma Farber First Book Award in 2014. LaTasha N. Nevada Diggs was a winner of the 2016 Whiting Award for \"TwERK.\" \"Cancer Angel\" by Beth Murray won the California Book Award for Poetry in 2016. In 2015, Sophie Seita won a PEN-HEIM Translation Grant for her translation of Uljana Wolf's \"Subsisters\". In 2016, an excerpt of \"Subsisters\" won second place in Asymptote's Close Approximations Translation Contest.\n\nThe Belladonna* reading series is foundational to the press's history and mission, predating even the first publications. The series is run by the reading series curators. Since 1999, curators have included Marcella Durand and Rachel Levitsky, erica kaufman, Emily Skillings, Krystal Languell, Jamila Wimberly, Cara Benson, Ariel Goldberg, LaTasha N. Nevada Diggs, Saretta Morgan, Chia-Lun Chang, Ana Paula, and Asiya Wadud. Belladonna* collaborates on the series with performance venues, academic institutions, arts and literary organizations, such as Abrons Art Center, Asian American Writers' Workshop, Berl's Brooklyn Poetry Shop, BGSQD, Bluestockings, Bowery Poetry Club, Brooklyn Art Library, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Public Library, Bryant Park Reading Series, CUNY Graduate Center, Dixon Place, Eugene Lang College, Housing Works Bookstore, La Casa Azul Bookstore, Lambda Literary, The Lesbian Herstory Archives, McNally Jackson, The Poetry Project, Pioneer Works, Pratt Institute, Queen's College, St. Mark's Bookstore, Unnameable Books, and ZieherSmith.\n\nBelladonna* documents its reading series through audio and visual recordings, as well as through the production of short-run chaplets for each of its readers. There are over 230 individually numbered chaplets in the series. The majority are single-authored pamphlets of under 15 pages. Several chaplets are multiply authored and many contain both texts and images. The chaplets are produced in a limited run of 150 copies. When copies sell out, Belladonna* uploads a reading PDF of the chaplet so that the out-of-print work is freely available. All of Belladonna’s readings are recorded and available for streaming or downloading at PennSound, an online project committed to preserving audio archives of poetry. Many of Belladonna's readers and chaplet authors are noted poets and writers, such as: Fanny Howe (#5), Mei-mei Berssenbrugge (#8), Lynne Tillman (#19), Anne Waldman (#26), Rosmarie Waldrop (#29), Alice Notley (#36), Lydia Davis (#40), Elaine Equi (#41), Maggie Nelson (#42), Anne Tardos (#47), Michelle Naka Pierce (#48), Leslie Scalapino (#50), Caroline Bergvall (#56), Susan Howe (#68), Lisa Robertson (#75), Ann Lauterbach (#85), Myung Mi Kim (#86), Dawn Lundy Martin (#89), Marjorie Welish (#91), Rae Armantrout (#92), Anna Moschovakis (#102), Evie Shockley (#104), Jean Day (#114), Dodie Bellamy (#116), Bhanu Kapil (#28 and #127), Eileen Myles (#38 and #128), Cecilia Vicuña (#131), Carmen Giménez Smith (#132), Renee Gladman (#65 and #133), Juliana Spahr (#144), and many others. \n\n\"Sweet Dreams\" (2018)Pamela Sneed \n\n\"Landia\" (2018)Celina Su \n\n\"Subsisters\" (2017)Uljana Wolf, translated by Sophie Seita \n\n\"Gates & Fields\" (2017)Jennifer Firestone \n\n\"Astrobolism\" (2016)Caroline Crumpacker \n\n\"Cancer Angel\" (2016)Beth Murray \n\n\"A Swarm of Bees in High Court\" (2015)Tonya Foster \n\n\"All Is Not Yet Lost\" (2015)Betsy Fagin \n\n\"Theory, A Sunday (\"2013)Louky Bersianik, Nicole Brossard, Louise Cotnoir, Louise Dupré, Gail Scott, and France Théoret, translated by Erica Weitzman, Nicole Peyrafitte, Popahna Brandes, and Luise von Flotow, with an introduction by Lisa Robertson and an Afterword by Rachel Levitsky and Gail Scott \n\n\"TwERK\" (2013)LaTasha N.

Though the initial novellas received mixed-to-positive reviews, the project was heralded by many in the press as \"bold\" and \"ambitious\", with \"Metro\" calling it \"one of the most ambitious acts of mass storytelling in recent years\".\n\nThe series is intended to have an international focus, with contributing authors that have included Russian writer Victor Pelevin and Israeli author David Grossman. Also, the first title in the series, Karen Armstrong's \"A Short History of Myth\", was published the same day in 33 countries and 28 languages, in what \"The Washington Post\" called \"the biggest simultaneous publication ever\". As of 2008, nine books have been published in the series, with Byng hoping to eventually publish 100.\n\nThree titles were published in the United Kingdom on 1 November 2007: \"Binu and the Great Wall\" by Su Tong, \"Girl Meets Boy\" by Ali Smith, and \"Where Three Roads Meet\" by Salley Vickers.

The catalogue is available in twelve languages and is used by research scientists, citizen scientists, educators, and policy makers. The catalogue is used by the Biodiversity Heritage Library, the Barcode of Life Data System, Encyclopedia of Life, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The catalogue currently compiles data from 168 peer-reviewed taxonomic databases, that are maintained by specialist institutions around the world. As of 2018, the catalogue lists 1.8m of the world's 1.9m named species.\n\nThe Catalogue of Life employs a simple data structure to provide information on synonymy, grouping within a taxonomic hierarchy, common names, distribution and ecological environment.\n\nThe Catalogue provides a dynamic edition, which is updated monthly (and in which data can change without tracking of those changes) and an Annual Checklist, which provides a dated, verifiable reference for the usage of names and associated data. Development of the Catalogue of Life was funded through the Species 2000 europa (EuroCat), 4d4Life, i4Life projects in 2003-2013, and currently by the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden, the Netherlands and Species Files group at Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign-Urbana IL, USA.\n\nMuch of the use of the Catalogue is to provide a backbone taxonomy for other global data portals and biological collections. Through the i4Life project it has formal partnerships with Global Biodiversity Information Facility, European Nucleotide Archive, Encyclopedia of Life, European Consortium for the Barcode of Life, IUCN Red List, and Life Watch. \nThe public interface includes both search and browse functions as well as offering multi lingual services.\n\nThe catalogue listed 300,000 species by 2003, 500,000 species by 2005, and over 800,000 species by 2006. As of 2018, the catalogue lists 1.8m of the world's 1.9m named species. There are an estimated 14m species, however this number is not certain as there is a lack of data on the possible number of insect, nematode, bacteria and fungus species.\n\nIn 2015, an expert panel presented a consensus hierarchical classification of life. The classification embraces 1.6 million species provided by more than 3,000 taxonomists. The unified, coherent, hierarchically-ranked system is known as the Catalogue of Life.\n\nIn the same year, the Catalogue of Life, Barcode of Life Data System, Biodiversity Heritage Library, Encyclopedia of Life, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility commenced building a single shared authoritative nomenclature and taxonomic foundation that could be used to order and connect biodiversity data. COL+ will develop a clearinghouse covering scientific names across all life, provide a single taxonomic view, and provide an avenue for feedback from content authorities.\n\n\n\n"}

DIRKS is an eight-step process in which all aspects, or as many as possible, of a business are studied in order to achieve a complete records management practice. In addition to these eight steps DIRKS includes several templates and questionnaires to guide one through the DIRKS methodology.\n\nDIRKS was replaced in 2007 at the Australian Commonwealth level, but continues to be in use at state level in New South Wales as a non-tool to assist the public sector in complying with the State Records Authority of New South Wales State Records Act 1998.\n\nBefore a preliminary investigation occurs DIRKS suggests a pre-preliminary investigation is performed where it is established if there is a need for a records management program at the organization and is there support for a record keeping system to be put in place. If so the preliminary investigation can take place. There are four components to the DIRKS preliminary investigation.\n\nThe purpose of Step B is to create a set of advisory statements from which an analysis of the organization's business activities can be determined.

The first is to determine an organization's requirements in creation and retention of records of its business activities. The second objective is to document the determined requirements in a clear manner that can be used as a reference in the future.\n\nThe main objective of Step D is to assess the existing recordkeeping systems and any other related information management systems that have the capacity to capture and maintain records. This assessment is to identify weaknesses and strengths within the existing system.\n\nThe main objective of Step E is to determine which policies, procedures, standards and various other tools will help the organization achieve its recordkeeping goals. With these strategies established a model for both record management and recordkeeping can be created.\n\nThe objective in Step F is to use the information gained in steps A through E a plan can be developed that fulfills the requirements set out in Step C.

He also edited \"Y Brython\" from 1858 to 1860 and published articles in \"Y Gwyddoniadur\". 1856 saw the publication of \"Llythyraeth yr Iaith Gymraeg\".\n\nFrom Llanymawddwy Evans published \"Gwaith Walter Evans\" (\"The Work of Walter Evans\", i.e. Gwallter Mechain), edited \"Y Marchog Crwydrad: Hen Ffuglith Gymreig\". In 1868 his translation of William Forbes Skene's \"The Four Ancient Books of Wales\" appeared. He edited \"Gwilym Lleyn\" in the Cambrian Bibliography in 1868 and published three articles in \"Revue Celtique\" in 1870 and 1875. In 1870 Silvan Evans translated a Breton liturgical text, \"Liherieu hag Avielei\". He edited \"Archaeologia Cambrensis\" from 1871 to 1875.\n\nIn 1876 Silvan Evans was collated to the living of Llanwrin, Montgomeryshire. He assisted Thomas Stephens with his monumental composition \"Literature of the Kymry\", co-edited a new edition of \"Llyfr Gweddi Cyffredin\" (the Book of Common Prayer in Welsh), and in 1878 edited Lewis Morris's \"Celtic Remains\". Through his son-in-law, Benjamin Williams, Vicar of Llanover, Monmouthshire, he was associated with Lady Llanover's attempt to rekindle Welshness on her model estate. These years were saddened by the loss of six of his seven children, and by his wife's fatal accident in 1889.\n\nFrom 1878 to 1884 Evans held a post as part-time Professor of Welsh at University College, Aberystwyth. Honours accrued, e.g. a D.Litt. from the University of Wales, collation as Prebendary of Llanfair (18/91) and subsequently (1889) as Chancellor of Bangor Cathedral.\nEvans is best known for his work on the Welsh language, including his concise English–Welsh dictionary (1858) and the extensive Dictionary (\"Geiriadur Cymraeg\") which he began publishing in 1887 and on which he continued to work until his death, at which time he was working on the letter E. His son, John Henry Silvan Evans, joined him in his labours.\n\nAccording to Thomas Parry (\"History of Welsh Literature to 1900\"), Silvan Evans coined the word \"telyneg\" to render the English \"lyric\", hence the title of an early work, \"Telynegion\" (1846), which apparently contained translations from Anacreon, Sappho, Ovid, French sonnets, and the work of English poets, especially Lord Byron. Parry judges Silvan Evans to have been overmuch influenced by William Owen Pughe's Dictionary in his use of vocabulary. However, R. E. Hughes in the \"Dictionary of Welsh Biography\" (1959) claims that Evans \"gradually became emancipated\" from Pughe's work.\n\n"}

The composition of the 17 volumes of text and 11 volumes of plates of the \"Encyclopédie\" was the work of over 150 authors belonging, in large part, to the intellectual group known as the philosophes. They promoted the advancement of science and secular thought and supported tolerance, rationality, and open-mindedness of the Enlightenment.\n\nMore than a hundred encyclopédistes have been identified. They were not a unified group, neither in ideology nor social class. Below some of the contributors are listed in alphabetical order, by the number of articles that they wrote, and by the identifying \"signature\" by which their contributions were identified in the \"Encyclopédie\".\n\nBeyond the known collaborators – at least in name – many articles are not signed and certain authors expressed a desire to remain anonymous. Other authors, Allard or Dubuisson for example, remain a mystery to us.

It deals with the nuclear fallout following a hypothetical disaster in the Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant in Cumbria on the British coast of the Irish Sea. The docu-drama suggests that, due to a changing wind direction, Ireland would bear the brunt of the British accident. The docu-drama was based on the false premise, that such an accident as depicted in the drama could happen and that parts of Ireland would need to be evacuated following a serious accident at Sellafield. Dr Ann McGarry, chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, said: \"The scenario envisaged in the programme is not realistic and grossly exaggerates the amount of radioactivity that could reach Ireland. The RPII cannot envisage any realistic scenario that would cause the radiation levels in Ireland to reach the concentrations as what was depicted in the drama\"</ref> Following the dramatized accident, the docu-drama depicts Irish evacuation riots, societal collapse and widespread health impacts.\n\nPart One aired on 23 April 2006, and focuses on the immediate aftermath of the incident and the implications which may arise for the Irish population. The plot is released in the style of \"breaking news\" (from both RTÉ News and BBC News 24) and as footage captured by a documentary crew and various camera phone video clips from eyewitnesses.\n\nPart Two aired 24 April 2006 and is set a year later, dealing with more long-term repercussions such as the social and economic climate. The main characters are revisited and interviewed.\n\nMinister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Dick Roche criticized the show for \"portraying Irish people as barbaric\". The accident scenario is considered outlandish. In addition, the Irish government are currently attempting through a court action to close the Sellafield nuclear plant; the topic of the programme may be regarded as being \"sub judice\".\n\n<br>\nWhen attempting to stem leaks found in the Sellafield facility, an explosion occurs. This sets off a further chain of explosions in the HASTs (Highly Active Storage Tank), resulting in the release of a highly radioactive plume. A north-easterly wind carries this radioactive material over the Irish Sea, which hits Ireland's eastern coast, particularly County Louth and the Dublin area (Ireland's main population centre) causing widespread chaos.\n\nHowever, this is not a credible scenario (for Sellafield at least). While a chemical explosion occurred in a Soviet fission product waste storage tank in 1957, this was due to the decomposition of red oil or alternatively the ignition of an acetate / nitrate mixture. At Sellafield no acetate or other chemical fuel is added to the liquid waste, which is stored in tanks for a short time before being converted to glass. The waste does not undergo any violent chemical reaction when it is dried out and heated with pyrex glass in a furnace. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland also voiced criticisms at the time of airing, Dr Ann McGarry, chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, said: The RPII was also concerned that the programme appeared to suggest that evacuation would be the appropriate response to an accident at Sellafield. With Dr. McGarry explaining that International best practice indicates that evacuation would not be required as Ireland is at sufficient distance from the British nuclear facilities, that radiation levels arising from an accident would never be sufficiently high to give rise to the effects displayed in the programme.\n"}

While Ordlaf is never explicitly identified as the author, it is apparent due to tenses and position of the speaker throughout the letter. The property in question was five hides of the Fonthill Estate in Ordlaf's county, which Ordlaf had given to the Bishop of Winchester.\n\nWhile the letter is not exactly dated, it is suggested that the dispute took place from approximately 897-899/901. This means it starts within the final years of Alfred's reign and the formative period of King Edward the Elder.\n\nThe letter, which survives in the original or a contemporary copy, largely believed to be an elaborate copy, traces the intricate history of the estate's ownership, telling of its former owner Helmstan, Ordlaf's Godson and a twice convicted thief of King Alfred's intervention, and of how the land subsequently passed into Ordlaf's sole ownership after Helmstan's second conviction for stealing a neighbour's oxen. \n\nThe letter was intended to be used as evidence in the ongoing lawsuit between Ordlaf and Higa over ownership of the land. Eventually, the letter served its purpose when Higa withdrew from the suit.\n\nThe letter is clearly not the work of a professional scribe or experienced writer due to numerous edits and corrections.\n\nEaldorman Ordlaf, a grandson of a West Saxon ealdorman, he was probably appointed in the latter years of King Alfred's reign. He is regularly relied upon by Helmstan to support him and pardon him from the crimes he commits.\n\nHelmstan's crimes take the form of first stealing a belt from Aethelred which initially leads to the dispute as Aethelhelm Higa can then claim the land should be forfeited to him. King Alfred at this point intervenes and grants Helmstan the right to maintain ownership. This did, however, damage Helmstan's standing and his consequent conviction for cattle-stealing was therefore magnified and his previous ill repute was raised during the second stage of the dispute.\n\nAethelhelm Higa is throughout the letter seen as the rival claimant. Very little is known about him although it is possible he was a descendent of either Aethelwulf and Aethelthryth or heir of Oswulf. In either case it seems he believed he should inherit the land by right and thus following Helmstan's conviction attempts to claim the estate.\n\nThe letter begins by following the conventional introduction for addressing the king and outlining the main purpose of the document, mainly the outlining of how the land at Fonthill was passed around.\n\nAccording to Keynes the story began in the last year or so of King Alfred’s reign, when Helmstan stole a belt belonging to a certain Aethelred. Although not detailed, it already shows Helmstan to have thief tendencies and this becomes important further into the letter. (He would then be treated in law as a man of ill-repute.) The importance of remaining ‘oath-worthy’ was therefore lost for Helmstan and his later conviction for cattle stealing brought up his previous crime and required Ordlaf to become involved.\n\nFollowing the initial accusations, Helmstan called on Ordlaf (godfather) to support him and his involvement then brought in Alfred as an inconsequential piece of land would never largely require his personal dedication.\n\nAlfred granted Helmstan entitlement to proceed with establishing his ownership but this still did not ensure asecure sense. Higa and Helmstan were ordered to reach an agreement. In the arbitration of the dispute, Helmstan once again can be accused of stealing as he never appears on a charter for his ownership of land and he may therefore have stolen the relevant charters from the rightful owner. However, these proved enough to ensure Helmstan maintained right to the land. This links to a treatise from the reign of King Edgar, the importance of proof of possession is greater than the one who attempts to claim the land.\n\nOn a specific date, Helmstan began to worry about the requisite oath; this resulted in him again calling on Ordlaf and offering him the land in exchange for assistance effectively a bribe, even though Ordlaf attempts to describe it as otherwise in the letter. After again succeeding in holding on to the land, the deed was given to Ordlaf (showing how Anglo-Saxon transfer of land would be related to the relevant title-deed).\n\nAfter an unknown period of time, Helmstan was caught stealing cattle and leading them from Fonthill (now Ordlafs estate) to his own neighbouring land. He was caught, however, after being scratched by a bramble attempting to run away from his pursuer.\n\nDue to his previous convictions and substantial evidence against him, Helmstan could no longer avoid conviction and Ordlaf could no longer assist him. All his goods were taken and land forfeited. This section of the letter does, however, raise the debate about Helmstan’s status and it is possible that he held a large area of land nearby and as such had a much more prominent presence in the locality, this points to him potentially being much more than a petty thief.\n\nThis did, however, mean that Ordlaf resumed possession of the five hides. A general principle of Anglo-Saxon law therefore emerges that any bookland would pass to the king on forfeiture while any land held on loan would revert to its rightful owner (although this may not have been universal and other claimants may emerge, thus a motivation for this letter perhaps).\n\nHelmstan never regained Fonthill but, after Alfred’s death and swearing an oath at his grave, Edward reversed his outlawry and granted him some property.\n\nFollowing this, Ordlaf promptly returns to authority over Fonthill but trades this with the bishop for 5 hides in Lydiard. Keynes’s section 15 thus sees Ordlaf appeal to the king to maintain the status quo as his new land relies on the continuance of the bishop holding Fonthill (which is still noted as belonging to the bishop of Winchester in 1066 and 1086)\n\nAn endorsement on the letter after it had been folded is then added described Higa withdrawing from his suit against the bishop but the exact nature of this is unknown.\n\nThis chronology owes much to the work of Simon Keynes and his analysis of the Fonthill Letter.\n\nThe letter would not have been significant at the time and would not have become a topic within the headlines of the Anglo-Saxon chronicle. However, historians now place great emphasis on the lessons it teaches about the working of Anglo-Saxon law and legal practices. It first received attention from Kentish antiquary William Somner and the letters text first appeared in print in the 1840 publication of John Mitchell Kemble's \"Codex Diplomaticus.\" It has now been approached by many historians with prominent examples being Simon Keynes and Dorothy Whitelock.\n\nThe document shows the earliest example of sent from an Anglo-Saxon layman to the king, it also shows the importance of kindred ties within Anglo-Saxon society as highlighted by the consistent support offered by Ordlaf for his godson Helmstan. The letter also raises concerns of corruption and abuse of power as seen through Helmstan's ability to twist proceedings through connections with powerful figures such as Ordlaf.\n\nIf looking for an accurate translation, then Whitelock's work in English Historical Documents offers an easy way to understand the events of the source material. Similarly, Simon Keyne's analysis of the document in 16 separate sections make understanding what can be a confusing document and otherwise easier task.\n"}

{"id": "317349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317349", "title": "James George Frazer", "text": "James George Frazer\n\nSir James George Frazer (; 1 January 1854 – 7 May 1941) was a Scottish social anthropologist and folklorist influential in the early stages of the modern studies of mythology and comparative religion. His most famous work, \"The Golden Bough\" (1890), documents and details the similarities among magical and religious beliefs around the globe. Frazer posited that human belief progressed through three stages: primitive magic, replaced by religion, in turn replaced by science.\n\nHe was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the son of Daniel F. Frazer, a chemist, and his wife, Katherine Brown.\n\nFrazer attended school at Springfield Academy and Larchfield Academy in Helensburgh. He studied at the University of Glasgow and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with honours in Classics (his dissertation was published years later as \"The Growth of Plato's Ideal Theory\") and remained a Classics Fellow all his life. From Trinity, he went on to study law at the Middle Temple, but never practised.\n\nFour times elected to Trinity's Title Alpha Fellowship, he was associated with the college for most of his life, except for a year, 1907–1908, spent at the University of Liverpool. He was knighted in 1914, and a public lectureship in social anthropology at the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Glasgow and Liverpool was established in his honour in 1921. He was, if not blind, then severely visually impaired from 1930 on. He and his wife, Lilly, died in Cambridge within a few hours of each other. They are buried at the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge, England.\n\nHis sister Isabella Katherine Frazer married the mathematician John Steggall FRSE.\n\nFrazer is commonly interpreted as an atheist in light of his criticism of Christianity and especially Roman Catholicism in \"The Golden Bough\". However, his later writings and unpublished materials suggest an ambivalent relationship with Neoplatonism and Hermeticism.\n\nThe study of myth and religion became his areas of expertise. Except for visits to Italy and Greece, Frazer was not widely travelled. His prime sources of data were ancient histories and questionnaires mailed to missionaries and imperial officials all over the globe. Frazer's interest in social anthropology was aroused by reading E. B. Tylor's \"Primitive Culture\" (1871) and encouraged by his friend, the biblical scholar William Robertson Smith, who was comparing elements of the Old Testament with early Hebrew folklore.\n\nFrazer was the first scholar to describe in detail the relations between myths and rituals. His vision of the annual sacrifice of the Year-King has not been borne out by field studies. Yet \"The Golden Bough\", his study of ancient cults, rites, and myths, including their parallels in early Christianity, continued for many decades to be studied by modern mythographers for its detailed information.\n\nThe first edition, in two volumes, was published in 1890; and a second, in three volumes, in 1900. The third edition was finished in 1915 and ran to twelve volumes, with a supplemental thirteenth volume added in 1936. He published a single-volume abridged version, largely compiled by his wife Lady Frazer, in 1922, with some controversial material on Christianity excluded from the text. The work's influence extended well beyond the conventional bounds of academia, inspiring the new work of psychologists and psychiatrists. Sigmund Freud cited \"Totemism and Exogamy\" frequently in his own \"Totem and Taboo: Resemblances Between the Psychic Lives of Savages and Neurotics\".\n\nThe symbolic cycle of life, death and rebirth which Frazer divined behind myths of many peoples captivated a generation of artists and poets. Perhaps the most notable product of this fascination is T. S. Eliot's poem \"The Waste Land\" (1922).\n\nFrazer's pioneering work has been criticised by late 20th-century scholars. For instance, in the 1980s Edmund Leach wrote a series of critical articles, one of which was featured as the lead in \"Anthropology Today\", vol. 1 (1985). He criticised \"The Golden Bough\" for the breadth of comparisons drawn from widely separated cultures, but often based his comments on the abridged edition, which omits the supportive archaeological details. In a positive review of a book narrowly focused on the \"cultus\" in the Hittite city of Nerik, J. D. Hawkins remarked approvingly in 1973, \"The whole work is very methodical and sticks closely to the fully quoted documentary evidence in a way that would have been unfamiliar to the late Sir James Frazer.\" More recently, \"The Golden Bough\" has been criticized for what are widely perceived as imperialist, anti-Catholic, classist and racist elements, including Frazer's assumptions that European peasants, Aboriginal Australians and Africans represented fossilized, earlier stages of cultural evolution.\n\nAnother important work by Frazer is his six-volume commentary on the Greek traveller Pausanias' description of Greece in the mid-2nd century AD. Since his time, archaeological excavations have added enormously to the knowledge of ancient Greece, but scholars still find much of value in his detailed historical and topographical discussions of different sites, and his eyewitness accounts of Greece at the end of the 19th century.\n\nAmong the most influential elements of the third edition of \"The Golden Bough\" is Frazer's theory of cultural evolution and the place Frazer assigns religion and magic in that theory. Frazer's theory of cultural evolution was not absolute and could reverse, but sought to broadly describe three (or possibly, four) spheres through which cultures were thought to pass over time. Frazer believed that, over time, culture passed through three stages, moving from magic, to religion, to science. Frazer's classification notably diverged from earlier anthropological descriptions of cultural evolution, including that of Auguste Comte, because he claimed magic was both initially separate from religion and invariably preceded religion. He also defined magic separately from belief in the supernatural and superstition, presenting an ultimately ambivalent view of its place in culture.\n\nFrazer believed that magic and science were similar because both shared an emphasis on experimentation and practicality; indeed, his emphasis on this relationship is so broad that almost any disproven scientific hypothesis technically constitutes magic under his system. In contrast to both magic and science, Frazer defined religion in terms of belief in personal, supernatural forces and attempts to appease them. As historian of religion Jason Josephson-Storm describes Frazer's views, Frazer saw religion as \"a momentary aberration in the grand trajectory of human thought.\" He thus ultimately proposed - and attempted to further - a narrative of secularization and one of the first social-scientific expressions of a disenchantment narrative.\n\nAt the same time, Frazer was aware that both magic and religion could persist or return. He noted that magic sometimes returned so as to become science, such as when alchemy underwent a revival in Early Modern Europe and became chemistry. On the other hand, Frazer displayed a deep anxiety about the potential of widespread belief in magic to empower the masses, indicating fears of and biases against lower-class people in his thought.\n\nFrazer collected stories from throughout the British Empire and devised four general classifications into which many of them could be grouped:\n\n\nThis type of story is common in Africa. Two messages are carried from the supreme being to mankind: one of eternal life and one of death. The messenger carrying the tidings of eternal life is delayed, and so the message of death is received first by mankind.\n\nThe Bantu people of Southern Africa, such as the Zulu, tell that Unkulunkulu, the Old Old One, sent a message that men should not die, giving it to the chameleon. The chameleon was slow and dawdled, taking time to eat and sleep. Unkulunkulu meanwhile had changed his mind and gave a message of death to the lizard who travelled quickly and so overtook the chameleon. The message of death was delivered first and so, when the chameleon arrived with its message of life, mankind would not hear it and so is fated to die.\n\nBecause of this, Bantu people, such as the Ngoni, punish lizards and chameleons. For example, children may be allowed to put tobacco into a chameleon's mouth so that the nicotine poisons it and the creature dies, writhing while turning colours.\n\nVariations of the tale are found in other parts of Africa. The Akamba say the messengers are the chameleon and the thrush while the Ashanti say they are the goat and the sheep.\n\nThe Bura people of northern Nigeria say that, at first, neither death nor disease existed but, one day, a man became ill and died. The people sent a worm to ask the sky deity, Hyel, what they should do with him. The worm was told that the people should hang the corpse in the fork of a tree and throw mush at it until it came back to life. But a malicious lizard, Agadzagadza, hurried ahead of the worm and told the people to dig a grave, wrap the corpse in cloth, and bury it. The people did this. When the worm arrived and said that they should dig up the corpse, place it in a tree, and throw mush at it, they were too lazy to do this, and so death remained on Earth. This Bura story has the common mythic motif of a vital message which is diverted by a trickster.\n\nIn Togoland, the messengers were the dog and the frog, and, as in the Bura version, the messengers go first from mankind to God to get answers to their questions.\n\nThe moon regularly seems to disappear and then return. This gave primitive peoples the idea that man should or might return from death in a similar way. Stories that associate the moon with the origin of death are found especially around the Pacific region. In Fiji, it is said that the moon suggested that mankind should return as he did. But the rat god, \"Ra Kalavo\", would not permit this, insisting that men should die like rats. In Australia, the Wotjobaluk aborigines say that the moon used to revive the dead until an old man said that this should stop. The Cham have it that the goddess of good luck used to revive the dead, but the sky-god sent her to the moon so she could not do this any more.\n\nAnimals which shed their skin, such as snakes and lizards, appeared to be immortal to primitive people. This led to stories in which mankind lost the ability to do this. For example, in Vietnam, it was said that the Jade Emperor sent word from heaven to mankind that, when they became old, they should shed their skins while the serpents would die and be buried. But some snakes overheard the command and threatened to bite the messenger unless he switched the message, so that man would die while snakes would be eternally renewed. For the natives of the island of Nias, the story was that the messenger who completed their creation failed to fast and ate bananas rather than crabs. If he had eaten the latter, then mankind would have shed their skins like crabs and so lived eternally.\n\nThe banana plant bears its fruit on a stalk which dies after bearing. This gave people such as the Nias islanders the idea that they had inherited this short-lived property of the banana rather than the immortality of the crab. The natives of Poso also based their myth on this property of the banana. Their story is that the creator in the sky would lower gifts to mankind on a rope and, one day, a stone was offered to the first couple. They refused the gift as they did not know what to do with it and so the creator took it back and lowered a banana. The couple ate this with relish, but the creator told them that they would live as the banana, perishing after having children rather than remaining everlasting like the stone.\n\nFrazer frequently used scientific terminology and analogies to describe ritual practices. For instance, he wrote: \"accordingly in these cases the oath, or whatever the ceremony may be, is purely magical in character. The man absorbs the valuable properties of the stone just as he might absorb electrical force from a battery; he is, to say, petrified by the stone in the one case, just as he is electrified by the electricity in the other.\" In other cases, he conflated magic and science altogether, speaking of the \"magic wand of science\". He often baldly characterized magical rituals as \"infallible\" without clarifying that this is merely what believers in the rituals thought.\n\nFrazer always wanted to portray himself as a careful and scientific writer. He wrote vivid descriptions of magical practices with the intention to repel readers, but, instead, these descriptions more often allured them. Classicist Mary Beard once commented that, if one wishes to go out and buy a copy of Frazer's \"Golden Bough\", that person's best bet is in an occult bookshop.\n\nOne of the most longstanding criticisms of Frazer is that he applied western European Christian ideas, theology, and terminology to non-Christian cultures, thereby distorting those cultures to make them appear more Christian. In one extreme case, Frazer took the word \"scapegoat\", originally coined in English to describe the specific ritual briefly mentioned in the Book of Leviticus , and applied it to cultures all around the world from all different time periods. Frazer routinely described non-Christian religious figures by equating them with Christian ones. For instance, he speaks of \"the Hottentot Adam\" and \"Deucalion, the Greek Noah\". Frazer particularly applied Christian terms to functionaries, for instance calling the elders of the Njamus of East Africa \"equivalent to the Levites of Israel\" and the Grand Lama of Lhasa \"the Buddhist Pope... the man-god who bore his people's sorrows, the Good Shepherd who laid down his life for the sheep\". He routinely uses the specifically Christian theological terms \"born again\", \"new birth\", \"baptism\", \"christening\", \"sacrament\", and \"unclean\" in reference to non-Christian cultures.\n\nWhen Frazer's Australian colleague Walter Baldwin Spencer requested to use native terminology to describe Aboriginal Australian cultures, arguing that doing so would be more accurate, since the Christian terms were loaded with Christian connotations that would be completely foreign to members of the cultures he was describing, Frazer insisted that he should use Judeo-Christian terms instead, telling him that using native terms would be off-putting and would seem pedantic. A year later, Frazer excoriated Spencer for refusing to equate the non-estrangement of Aboriginal Australian totems with the Christian doctrine of reconciliation. When Spencer, who had actually studied the aboriginals firsthand, objected that the ideas were not even remotely similar, Frazer insisted that they were exactly equivalent. Based on these exchanges, historian Timothy Larsen concludes that Frazer's deliberate use of Judeo-Christian terminology in the place of native terminology was not to make native cultures seem less strange, but rather to make Christianity seem more strange and barbaric.\n\n\n\n"}

By November 2012, Joconde contained over 475,000 object listings online and over 290,000 with images, from 366 collections in France, including 209,350 drawings, 63,547 paintings, 34,561 prints, 34,102 sculptures or 16,631 costumes and their accessories and is still expanding.\n\nThe database is not only dedicated to the information of the public but as well to the needs of the administrators and curators of the museums, thanks to the online presentation of professional tools to facilitate notably the museums collections cataloguing and state inventory (\"récolement\"). This explains the great precision of the listings. Since the museums participate on a voluntary basis to the regular enrichment of the database, some can present a large part of their collection, while others appear only because of the mere permanent deposits made by the first ones.\n\nLive on the French Minitel system from 1992, the database went online to the World Wide Web in 1995. Originally just for objects from the fine arts and decorative arts, in 2004 Joconde was united with what had been separate databases for objects from archeology and ethnology. It comes under the \"Direction des Musées de France\" (DMF) section of the Ministry.\n\nThe listing details are highly structured, using a special vocabulary, which allows for very specific and accurate searches, helped as well by the index. A small number of the best known objects have a prose commentary. Not all images are in colour, especially for the archaeological collections. When an object created after the 19th century has no image this is most often for copyright reasons.\n"}

{"id": "3614746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3614746", "title": "Mainstreaming (education)", "text": "Mainstreaming (education)\n\nMainstreaming, in the context of education, is the practice of placing students with special education services in a general education classroom during specific time periods based on their skills. This means general education classes are combined with special education classes. Schools that practice mainstreaming believe that students with special needs who cannot function in a general education classroom to a certain extent belong in the special education environment.\n\nAccess to a special education classroom, often called a \"self-contained classroom or resource room\", is valuable to the student with a disability. Students have the ability to work one-to-one with special education teachers, addressing any need for remediation during the school day. Many researchers, educators and parents have advocated the importance of these classrooms amongst political environments that favor their elimination.\n\nProponents of both philosophy of educational inclusion assert that educating children with disabilities alongside their non-disabled peers fosters understanding and tolerance, better preparing students of all abilities to function in the world beyond school. Children with special needs may face social stigma as a result of being mainstreamed, but also may help them socially develop.\n\n\nMainstreaming also benefits other children. It opens the lines of communication between those students with disabilities and their peers. If they are included into classroom activities, all students become more sensitive to the fact that these students may need extra assistance.\n\nSome people believe that educating non-disabled students and students with disabilities together creates an atmosphere of understanding and tolerance that better prepares students of all abilities to function in the world beyond school. Students without disabilities who engaged in an inclusive physical education program reported increases in self-concept, tolerance, self-worth, and a better understanding of other people. The students also reported that the inclusion program was important because it prepared them to deal with disability in their own lives. Positive aspects that come from inclusion are often attributed to contact theory. Contact theory asserts that frequent, meaningful, and pleasant interactions between people with differences tend to produce changes in attitude.\n\nAlthough mainstreaming in education has been shown to provide benefits, there are also disadvantages to the system.\n\nOne potentially serious disadvantage to mainstreaming is that a mainstreamed student may require much more attention from the teacher than non-disabled students in a general class. Time and attention may thus be taken away from the rest of the class to meet the needs of a single student with special needs. The effect that a mainstreamed student has on the whole class depends strongly on the particular disabilities in question and the resources available for support. In many cases, this problem can be mitigated by placing an aide in the classroom to assist the student with special needs, although this raises the costs associated with educating this child. The added cost of an aide in a classroom to meet needs of special education students can be offset by not funding a teacher in a wholly separate classroom when mainstreaming does not occur.\n\nTeachers are encouraged to teach the entire class differently. This includes being less abstract and more concrete in content, changing lighting, simplifying the design of the classroom, and having a predictable structure and routine rather than novelty.\n\nParents fear that general education teachers do not have the training and skills to accommodate special needs students in a general education classroom setting. However, professional training and supportive services can usually address these concerns. Some research has suggested teachers who are not aware of—and later may choose not to adopt—modifications needed for students with special needs are also more resistant to having these students in class. This can lead to regression of the students with disabilities as well as overall decreased classroom productivity.\n\nIt has been seen that general educators provide 98.7% of their teaching time doing whole class interactions. Students with disabilities have been known to require a significant more amount of individual attention with the classroom teacher. Children with disabilities spend twice as much time in whole-class activities as in one-to-one activities due to the amount of whole-class teaching, yet these students are half as likely to engage in whole-class learning activities such as writing, reading and participating showing that whole group activities do not meet the needs of students with disabilities as much as individual work would.\n\nCompared to fully included students with disabilities, those who are mainstreamed for only certain classes or certain times may feel conspicuous or socially rejected by their classmates. They may become targets for bullying. Mainstreamed students may feel embarrassed by the additional services they receive in a regular classroom, such as an aide to help with written work or to help the student manage behaviors. Some students with disabilities may feel more comfortable in an environment where most students are working at the same level or with the same supports. In the United States, students with autism spectrum disorders are more frequently the target of bullying than non-autistic students, especially when their educational program brings them into regular contact with non-autistic students.\n\nAs seen above, there are many social issues; however, a buddy system has been shown to improve these issues. Through having a buddy system an upper school student will be paired with a younger child preferable with a disability by doing this the younger student is provided with a positive relationship with a fellow student even though they are older. Through the buddy system the younger student will learn the benefits of having and sustaining a positive and supportive friendship, learns to value opinion just by having the upper school student around. These social issues are improved due to the upper school student helping to alter the social experiences of the younger child through this formed friendship.\n\nSchools are required to provide special education services but may not be given additional financial resources. The per-student cost of special education is high. The U.S.'s 2005 Special Education Expenditures Program (SEEP) indicates that the cost per student in special education ranges from a low of $10,558 for students with learning disabilities to a high of $20,095 for students with multiple disabilities. The average cost per pupil for a regular education with no special education services is $6,556. Therefore, the average expenditure for students with learning disabilities is 1.6 times that of a general education student.\n\nCareful attention must be given as well to combinations of students with disabilities in a mainstreamed classroom. For example, a student with conduct disorder may not combine well with a student with autism, while putting many children with dyslexia in the same class may prove to be particularly efficient.\n\nDeafness is a low-incidence disability, which means that a deaf child will often be the only student in the classroom with hearing loss. This leads to a special set of issues in the mainstream classroom. While students with other disabilities may experience isolation and bullying by their non-disabled peers, they often share a common language. This is not the case for deaf students. Very few people in the mainstream academic setting know sign language, which means the communication barrier is large and can have negative effects on both academic achievement and social development. \n\nThe alternatives to mainstreaming for special needs students are separation, inclusion, and excluding the student from school. Normally, the student's individual needs are the driving force behind selecting mainstreaming or another style of education.\n\nMainstreaming does not involve putting a child full-time in a special school.\n\nMainstreaming does not involve placing a child full-time in a regular classroom. A student who spends the entire day in a regular classroom with non-disabled peers is considered fully included. Most students with mild levels of disabilities such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder, or with non-cognitive disabilities such as diabetes are fully included.\n\nMainstreaming does not involve teaching the child outside of school. A student who is taught in an institution (such as a hospital) or at home (such as while recovering from a serious illness) is excluded. Such a student may receive individual instruction or may attend small group instruction. A student who is excluded from school may or may not have been expelled from the school.\n\nBefore the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) was enacted in 1975, U.S. public schools educated only 1 out of 5 children with disabilities. Approximately 200,000 children with disabilities such as deafness or mental retardation lived in state institutions that provided limited or no educational or rehabilitation services, and more than a million children were excluded from school. Another 3.5 million children with disabilities attended school but did not receive the educational services they needed. Many of these children were segregated in special buildings or programs that neither allowed them to interact with non-disabled students nor provided them with even basic academic skills.\n\nThe EHA, later renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), required schools to provide specialized educational services to children with disabilities. The ultimate goal was to help these students live more independent lives in their communities, primarily by mandating access to the general education standards of the public school system.\n\nInitially, children with disabilities were often placed in heterogeneous \"special education\" classrooms, making it difficult for any of their difficulties to be addressed appropriately. In the 1980s, the mainstreaming model began to be used more often as a result of the requirement to place children in the least restrictive environment (Clearinghouse, E. 2003). Students with relatively minor disabilities were integrated into regular classrooms, while students with major disabilities remained in segregated special classrooms, with the opportunity to be among normal students for up to a few hours each day. Many parents and educators favored allowing students with disabilities to be in classrooms along with their nondisabled peers.\n\nIn 1997, IDEA was modified to strengthen requirements for properly integrating students with disabilities. The IEPs must more clearly relate to the general-education curriculum, children with disabilities must be included in most state and local assessments, such as high school exit exams, and regular progress reports must be made to parents. All public schools in the U.S. are responsible for the costs of providing a Free Appropriate Public Education as required by federal law. Mainstreaming or inclusion in the regular education classrooms, with supplementary aids and services if needed, are now the preferred placement for all children. Children with disabilities may be placed in a more restricted environment only if the nature or severity of the disability makes it impossible to provide an appropriate education in the regular classroom.\n\nIt has been estimated that in the year of 2009 there has been 292,600 children attending school within Australia that has been diagnosed with a disability also within this year it has been seen that there had been a higher rate of participation within school activities coming from children with a disability compared to children without one. It has been shown that almost one in ten boys within schools (186,000) had been diagnosed with a disability where the level of girls within a school (106,600) diagnosed with a disability was around one in sixteen. Within mainstream schools it has been shown that primary schools had a higher number of students with disabilities with a high 9.1% where students within secondary schools where only 7.4% had a disability. Out of the 71,000 students attending school with a disability 64.7% have been known to have a severe or core-activated limitation. It has also been proven that special needs children within Australia demonstrate higher academic outcomes when in a mainstream school where they have been given opportunities to engage in higher academic levels and activities. Having children with a disability in a mainstream school has also been shown to increase in independent communication and motor skills.\n\n\n"}

It was published in Paris between 1836 and 1850 and are divided into four sections and 71 parts. The work was the most important text about the Canary Islands in the 19th century in the field of natural sciences.\n\nThe text was originally written in French, it saved a large part of Phytographia Canariensis (Canarian Phytography), it was later written in Latin. In addition to the two main authors, it took part in an important scientific composition which was carried into dedicated parts, zoology and botany of the islands. The work includes more than 430 pages including engravings and drawings made by the most prestigious draughtsmen and engravers of the time (one of them was the English J.J. Williams) and makes up of one of the greatest attractive works, where it contributed to a science text of the first half of the 19th century, it continued to have interests, even validity, in areas with cartography, the systematic botany and geo-botany, also in certain different Canarian zoology. The themes of the work is very broad and surpasses which was traditionally for natural history - a name which was later replaced with natural sciences, for which more of it broadened the three kingdoms of nature, geology, botany and zoology), dedicaded a part of the work to physical, botanical, economic and human geography, and questions of history and ethnography of the Canaries.\n\nPhilip Barker-Webb, on one of his trips to the Brazilian expedition, planned a short visit to the Canary Islands, instead, he stayed for a longer time. During his time in the islands between 1828 and 1920, he recollected the specimens from the area and together with Sabin Berthelot, he made an encyclopedic like work which took about 20 years to complete. One of the other contributors to the work included Justin Pierre Marie Macquart and Alfred Moquin-Tandon.\n\n"}

Sometimes only questioning occurs; sometimes there is a statement with no questions permitted.\n\nA media event at which no statements are made, and no questions allowed, is called a photo op. A government may wish to open their proceedings for the media to witness events, such as the passing of a piece of legislation from the government in parliament to the senate, via a media availability.\n\nTelevision stations and networks especially value news conferences: because today's TV news programs air for hours at a time, or even continuously, assignment editors have a steady appetite for ever-larger quantities of footage.\n\nNews conferences are often held by politicians (such as the President of the United States); by sports teams; by celebrities or film studios; by commercial organizations to promote products; by attorneys to promote lawsuits; and by almost anyone who finds benefit in the free publicity afforded by media coverage. Some people, including many police chiefs, hold news conferences reluctantly in order to avoid dealing with reporters individually.\n\nA news conference is often announced by sending an advisory or news release to assignment editors, preferably well in advance. Sometimes they are held spontaneously when several reporters gather around a newsmaker.\n\nNews conferences can be held just about anywhere, in settings as formal as the White House room set aside for the purpose to as informal as the street in front of a crime scene.

In athletics, teams and leagues host media days prior to the season and may host them prior to special events during the season like all-star games and championship games.\n\n"}

A notary's commission is received from and kept on file with the county clerk of the county in which they reside or do business, but notaries are empowered to actually perform their duties anywhere in the state.\n\nNotaries must be residents of the state \"or\" have a work/business address in the state. Attorneys at law may automatically be appointed notaries simply by submitting the filing fee. Someone who is a commissioner or inspector of elections may also be a notary. One designated employee of the county clerk may be appointed a notary without taking the test. A state legislator may also be a notary, without any conflict of interest. Since the passage of the Married women's property acts in the mid-19th century, a married woman can be a notary. \n\nCertain persons \"cannot\" be commissioned as a notary public in New York. These include a non-citizen, someone who has neither a residence nor a business in New York, a person convicted of certain felonies, a person removed from office as notary or commissioner of deeds, and a convicted draft dodger. By a New York law that bars them from holding any other office, sheriffs may not be appointed notaries. The above general conditions can however be remedied with a release from the state after a certificate of good conduct is issued or by executive pardon.\n\nNew York notaries are empowered to administer oaths and affirmations (including oaths of office), to take affidavits and depositions, to receive and certify acknowledgments or proof of deeds, mortgages and powers of attorney and other instruments in writing. Notaries may also demand acceptance or payment of foreign and inland bills of exchange, promissory notes and obligations in writing. Finally, they can witness the opening of a safe deposit box and provide an inventory of the contents.\n\nNew York Notaries may not issue certified copies of official documents (i.e. birth certificate, marriage certificate, bankruptcy discharge, etc.); notably (as emphasized by official publications) they may \"not\" certify copies of documents (for instance, \"I hereby certify that this is a true and correct copy...,\" is beyond the authority of a New York State notary). However, a notary may sign a form of affidavit on a copy where the document's custodian signs and swears to the authenticity of the document (usually a government issued picture ID). This can suffice as a \"notarized copy\" in most instances, but is not a certified copy. A notary cannot prepare legal documents, offer any advice, or review documents for legality (even offering an opinion as to whether a document needs notarization is considered to be \"practicing law without a license\" in New York); and they may \"not\" solemnize marriages. Further, a notary is not needed to witness a will: in New York, two witnesses, who do not need to be notaries, must attend the will signing ceremony and be able to attest to the mental competence of the testator. A notary may, however, notarize a self-proving affidavit signed by the maker of the will and the two witnesses, which will facilitate the proof of the will in probate.\n\nNew York does not require that notaries use an official seal or stamp - the embossed seal is now a decorative addition to a document rather than a requirement of law, and is itself insufficient for a notarization. New York notaries may write in black ink, or may stamp with a rubber stamp, the required information for notarization: their name; the words \"Notary Public, State of New York\"; the county in which they are qualified (that is, the county in which the county clerk holds their original certificate and signature card); the county which additional signature certificates are filed (done for convenience of authenticating their notarizations); the date that the notary's commission expires (commissions are renewed every four years); and, only if qualified in New York City (the counties of The Bronx, Richmond, Kings, Queens and New York) a registration number. This information, with the notary's signature and the date and place of notarization are required for a legal notarization. \nIn New York, a Notary Public commission is granted for a four-year term. Other than the pre-qualification examination, no continuing education is required. There is a $60.00 re-appointment fee required every 4 years and paid to the County Clerk of the Notary Public. The renewal application is posted to the Notary approximately 3 months prior to the expiration. The commission may be renewed up until 6 months after the expiration date without\nre-qualifying for non-military personnel; a grace period extends for 12 months after the Honorable Discharge of a member of the United States Military. \n\"A typical layout for a notary's rubber stamp, for use beneath the notary's signature.\"\n\nNotaries may charge fees (the maximum is $2) for certain acts, but many choose to either personally waive them, or their employers have a policy of not permitting the notary to charge patrons (I.e., clients and customers of their company, agency or firm; for example, many banks have notaries on duty to serve their depositors for free). Each county clerk also has a notary on duty in the clerk's office to serve the public at no charge.\n\nAs of April, 2017, New York State had approximately 291,000 commissioned notaries public.\n\nCities in the State of New York appoint and commission an officer called a Commissioner of Deeds, which can be applied for with the respective City Clerk's office and is appointed by the City Council. \n"}
{"id": "54224675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54224675", "title": "Nursing documentation", "text": "Nursing documentation\n\nNursing documentation is the record of nursing care that is planned and delivered to individual clients by qualified nurses or other caregivers under the direction of a qualified nurse. It contains information in accordance with the steps of the nursing process. Nursing documentation is the principal clinical information source to meet legal and professional requirements, and one of the most significant components in nursing care. Quality nursing documentation plays a vital role in the delivery of quality nursing care services through supporting better communication between different care team members to facilitate continuity of care and safety of the clients.\n\n\nThe internationally accepted nursing process consists of five steps: assessment, nursing problem/diagnosis, goal, intervention and evaluation. Nursing process model provides the theoretical framework for nursing documentation. A nurse can follow this model to assess the clinical situation of a client and record a constructive document for nursing communication.\n\nNursing documentation mainly consists of a client's background information or nursing history referred as admission form, numerous assessment forms, nursing care plan and progress notes. These documents record the client's data captured at the relevant stages of the nursing process. The following sections describe the concept, aim, possible structure and content of these nursing documents using the example of nursing documentation in Australian residential aged care homes.\n\nAn admission form is a fundamental record in nursing documentation. It documents a client's status, reasons why the client is being admitted, and the initial instructions for that client's care. The form is completed by a nurse when a client is admitted to a health care facility.\n\nThe admission form provides the basic information to establish foundations for further nursing assessment. It usually contains the general data about a client, such as name, gender, age, birth date, address, contact, identification information (ID) and some situational descriptions about marriage, work or other background information. Based on the different nursing care provider's requirements, this form may also record family history, past medical history, history of present illness, and allergies (see Figure 1).\nThe documentation of nursing assessment is the recording of the process about how a judgment was made and its related factors, in addition to the result of the judgment. It makes the process of nursing assessment visible through what is presented in the documentation content.\n\nDuring nursing assessment, a nurse systematically collects, verifies, analyses and communicates a health care client's information to derive a nursing diagnosis and plan individualized nursing care for the client. Complete and accurate nursing assessment determines the accuracy of the other stages of the nursing process.\n\nThe nursing documents may contain a number of assessment forms. In an assessment form, a licensed Registered Nurse records the client's information, such as physiological, psychological, sociological, and spiritual status (see Figure 2). The accuracy and completeness of nursing assessment determine the accuracy of care planning in the nursing process.\nThe nursing care plan (NCP) is a clinical document recording the nursing process, which is a systematic method of planning and providing care to clients. It was originally developed in hospitals to guide nursing students or junior nurses in providing care to client; however, the format was task-oriented rather than nursing-process-based. Nowadays, the NCP is widely used in nursing in various clinical and educational settings as a tool to direct individualized nursing care for clients.\n\nThe nurses make nursing care plans based on the assessments they have completed previously with a client. There are many ways of structuring nursing care plans in correspondence with the different needs of nursing care in different nursing specialties. For example, a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home may be structured with several sections under each care domain such as pain, mobility, lifestyle, nutrition and continence. The information is recorded in free-text style, and various terms are used singly or in combination to name each of the four sections in the formats that are used by a facility during a particular period (Figure 3). \n\nA progress note is the record of nursing actions and observations in the nursing care process. It helps nurses to monitor and control the course of nursing care.\n\nGenerally, nurses record information with a common format. Nurses are likely to record details about a client's clinical status or achievements during the course of the nursing care.\n\nThe paper-based nursing documentation has been in place for decades. Client's data are recorded in paper documents. The information in these documents needs to be integrated for sense-making in a nursing decision.\n\nElectronic nursing documentation is an electronic format of nursing documentation an increasingly used by nurses. Electronic nursing documentation systems have been implemented in health care organizations to bring in the benefits of increasing access to more complete, accurate and up-to-date data and reducing redundancy, improving communication and care service delivery.\n\nElectronic nursing documentation systems are able to produce somewhat better quality data in comparison with paper-based systems, in certain respects depending on the characteristics of the systems and the practice of the various study settings. The common benefits of electronic documentation systems include the improvement of comprehensiveness in documenting the nursing process, the use of standardized language and the recording of specific items about particular client issues and relevance of the message. In addition, electronic systems can improve legibility, dating and signing in nursing records.\n\nFor the documentation of nursing assessment, the electronic systems significantly increased the quantity and comprehensiveness of documented assessment forms in each record. In regard to the NCP, the electronic standardized NCPs were graded with a higher total quality score than its paper-based counterpart. In addition, in comparison with the paper-based documentation systems, the electronic systems, due to their automatic functions, were able to improve the format, structure and process features of documentation quality such as legibility, signing, dating, crossing out error and space with a single line and resident identification on every page.\n\nPaper-based documentation has been found to be inferior in comparison with electronic documentation. This is caused by the inherent nature of paper being difficult to update, time-consuming in a recording. Thus, the records are often incomplete, illegible, repetitive and missing signatures.\n\nElectronic nursing documentation systems have the potential to improve the quality of documentation structure and format, process and content in comparison with paper-based documentation, as demonstrated in a comparative study of electronic and paper-based nursing admission forms. However, improvement in documentation quality is not necessarily to be brought about by the introduction of electronic nursing documentation system to replace paper-based documentation. For example, Wang et al. that although the electronic nursing assessment form contained more documented assessment forms, which covered a wider range of resident care needs, they did not perform better than the previous [null paper-based assessment forms according to] the quality criteria of [null completeness] and timeliness. Therefore, further work on the usage of the electronic documentation systems may focus on improving form design and usage. There is also a need for improvement in compliance with standards in order to better meet the clients' care needs.\n\nA study by the National Client Safety Agency (NPSA) found that poor standards of documentation were a contributory factor in the failure to detect clients who were clinically deteriorating. Nurses are responsible for maintaining accurate records of the care they provide and are accountable if information is incomplete and inaccurate. Thus, a quality standard is required for recording of nursing documentation.\n\nThe systematic review of nursing documentation audit studies in different settings identified the following relevant quality characteristics of nursing documentation:\n\n\nNorth American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) nursing diagnosis:\n\nNANDA International (formerly the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) is a professional organization of nurses standardized nursing terminology that was officially founded in 1982 and develops, researches, disseminates and refines the nomenclature, criteria, and taxonomy of nursing diagnoses.\n\nNursing intervention classification (NIC):\n\nThe Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) is a care classification system which describes the activities that nurses perform as a part of the planning phase of the nursing process associated with the creation of a nursing care plan.\n\nNursing outcome classification (NOC):\n\nThe Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) is a classification system which describes client outcomes sensitive to nursing intervention.\n\nThe Omaha System:\n\nThe Omaha System is a standardized health care terminology consisting of an assessment component (Problem Classification Scheme), a care plan/services component (Intervention Scheme), and an evaluation component (Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes).\n\nInternational Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP):\n\nThe International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) is a collaborative project under the auspices of the International Council of Nurses. The ICNP provides a structured and defined vocabulary as well as a classification for nursing and a framework into which existing vocabularies and classifications can be cross-mapped to enable comparison of nursing data.\n\nStructured documentation takes the form of pre-printed guidelines for specific aspects of care and can, therefore, focus nursing care upon diagnoses, treatment aims, client outcomes and evaluations of care. It can improve client care by replacing the practice of vague, narrative style entries by nurses with cohesive and accurate information determined by the format of the care plan.  The clarity of the recorded information also facilitates clinical auditing and evaluation of documentation practices through. Therefore, the introduction of structured documentation and care plans are seen as a means by which nurses can raise standards of record-keeping practice.\n"}

It was introduced in a 2010 paper by Dana Carney, Amy Cuddy, and Andy Yap.\nThe idea has been referred to as pseudoscience.\n\nScholars have reported being unable to replicate power posing effects in follow-up studies. In 2017 alone, 11 studies were published that were unable to reproduce the effect found by Cuddy. The theory has been described as an example of the replication crisis in psychology, in which initially seductive theories could not be replicated on follow-up tests. \n\nDana Carney, the lead author of the original article, issued a statement in 2016 abandoning the theory: \"I do not believe that 'power pose effects' are real...the evidence against the existence of power poses is undeniable\", while Cuddy has continued work on it.\n\nIn 2018 Cuddy, with two other authors, published additional research; the paper had been submitted in August 2016, a revised version was submitted in November 2017, and the paper published online on April 1, 2018. In the paper, they conducted expansive experiment and showed that, with statistical significance that, power pose (now referred as posture feedback) can make people feel more powerful, yet failed to prove that hormones can be altered by doing so.\n\nThe initial research on power posing was published in 2010. The authors claimed that high-power poses \"produce power\". The study included 42 participants, who were coached by researchers to assume a physical position of power. Hormone levels were measured before and after, and the authors stated that they found an increase in testosterone and a decrease in cortisol after posing. \n\nA 2015 article, published in \"Psychological Science\" by Ranehill et al. refuted findings in Carney et al. (2010). Carney strongly favored the publication of the Ranehill case of failed replication in her review of the article.\n\nThe statistical methods that may have led to the original erroneous findings were reviewed by noted researchers including Uri Simonsohn and Joseph P. Simmons of the Wharton School in their 2016 paper and concluded that previous research failed to \"suggest the existence of an effect once we account for selective reporting\". \n\nIn the years that followed, attempts were made by various research groups to apply power posing manipulation in different contexts. The results did not support the assumptions made by Cuddy et al. In a 2016 study by Garrison et al. the effect of posture manipulation was combined with dominant vs. submissive gaze. Despite a large sample size, no effect was found on risk taking and, in contrast to original expectations, adopting an expansive pose reduced feelings of power. Deuter et al. (2016) investigated the effect of cognitive role taking and Cuddy's power posing manipulation in the Trier Social Stress Test; although role taking had an influence on the cortisol and testosterone response after stress, the posture manipulation had no effect on hormonal, behavioral or subjective measures. Where influences on hormones were found, these were sometimes opposite to the predicted direction. In a study conducted by Smith et al. in 2017, participants had to compete in a challenging task while the had to assume high or low power poses. The authors report no main effect of pose type on testosterone, cortisol, risk or feelings of power. However, they found an interaction between pose type and competition outcome on testosterone: while winners assigned to a high-power pose had small rise in testosterone levels. Yet, losers had a reduction in testosterone after holding high-power poses. \n\nOther scientists have attempted to come up with an explanation for how the effect could have been found, by excluding factors such as gender-based differences in hormone levels.\n\nIn 2016 Carney published a statement on the University of California, Berkeley website, stating that she no longer believed the effect was valid.\n\nJoseph Cesario, an associate professor of psychology at Michigan State University, who co-edits \"Comprehensive Results in Social Psychology\", arranged a special issue on power posing that published in June 2017; the issue included eleven new studies, along with a meta-analyses, which found that the effect of power posing on power behaviors was not replicated. The published studies were designed to definitively answer whether the power-posing hypothesis was real and included high quality research features like pre-registration of endpoints. Carney co-authored the introduction to the issue, and noted that while the meta-analysis failed to find any effect in power behaviors, it did find a small effect in a feeling of power; she also wrote that the studies could not resolve whether the effect on a feeling of power was an only experimental artifact.\n\nThe concept gained attention after a TED talk given by Cuddy in 2012, where she demonstrated the posture and argued for its benefits. CNN and Oprah discussed \"power posing\". By 2017, Cuddy's 2012 TED talk on had become \"TED's second-most popular\" and had been viewed by about 47 million viewers. Cuddy said that she felt that the idea appealed to her given her experience of recovering from head trauma in a car accident, which she said helped develop her interest in \"studying how people can become their aspirational selves...How can you become a self that you are not now?\" \n\nAn extensive series of articles on power posing replication was published by \"New York\" magazine by Jesse Singal and other contributors in its \"Science of Us\" section.\n\nCuddy reported experiencing harassment, including death threats, after the findings were refuted.\n\n"}

Pre-distribution is the idea that the state should try to prevent inequalities occurring in the first place rather than ameliorating inequalities through the tax and benefits system once they have occurred as occurs under redistribution.\n\nIn addition, the term 'predistribution' has been used (in the same sense as indicated above) by authors James Robertson and Joseph Huber in the book, \"Creating New Money\" (New Economics Foundation, London, UK) and, then, in various publications associated with the Campaign for Co-operative Socialism, including a set of five articles published in Winter 2009/2010 by \"The CCPA Monitor\" (the publication of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives), and then, in May 2010, as a collection: \"CCPA Readings on Co-operative Socialism\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Labour Party leader Ed Miliband showed interest in the concept, telling a Policy Network seminar at the London Stock Exchange that \"Predistribution is about saying we cannot allow ourselves to be stuck with permanently being a low-wage economy\". The concept has been seen as resulting from a recognition that were Labour to return to government they would not be able to reverse all Coalition cuts and implement traditional redistributive policies due to the poor state of the economy and instead need to focus on policies that make \"work pay\" for the poorest in society. \nTristram Hunt, a Labour MP, called for predistribution in his chapter in \"The Purple Book\" as a way to reform the economy whilst having fiscal restraint and fellow Purple Book contributor Rachel Reeves used the term in a June 2012 Progress article.\nLord Wood of Anfield, an adviser to Miliband, has argued that the \"pre-distribution\" agenda is necessary because \"In the face of rising inequality, declining social mobility and stagnating real wages for middle-income earners, there are limits to what redistribution can achieve on its own\".\n\nIn an article in \"The Guardian\", Hacker described the three major themes of predistribution in a UK environment:\n\nThere has been discussion of whether predistribution is practical. BBC Political Correspondent Ian Watson argues that a predistributive policy might, for instance, require a business (when bidding for a government contract) to pay the living wage rather than the national minimum wage, something that may be difficult during times of austerity although Watson's argument has been countered by the independent Commission on Living Standards.\n\nSome commentators have gone so far as to suggest that the concept of predistribution has simply been invented, and lacks any real substance.\n\n\n"}

Issued August 23, 1775, it declared elements of the American colonies in a state of \"open and avowed rebellion\". It ordered officials of the British Empire \"to use their utmost endeavours to withstand and suppress such rebellion\". The Proclamation also encouraged subjects throughout the Empire, including those in Great Britain, to report anyone carrying on \"traitorous correspondence\" with the rebels so that they could be punished.\n\nThe Proclamation was written before Colonial Secretary Lord Dartmouth had been given a copy of the Olive Branch Petition from the Continental Congress. Because the king refused to receive the petition, the Proclamation effectively served as an answer to the petition.\n\nOn October 27, 1775, North's Cabinet expanded on the Proclamation in the Speech from the Throne read by the King at the opening of Parliament. The speech insisted that rebellion was being fomented by a \"desperate conspiracy\" of leaders whose claims of allegiance to him were insincere; what the rebels really wanted, he said, was to create an \"independent Empire\". The speech indicated that the King intended to deal with the crisis with armed force, and was even considering \"friendly offers of foreign assistance\" to suppress the rebellion without pitting Briton against Briton. A pro-American minority in Parliament warned that the government was driving the colonists towards independence, something that many colonial leaders had insisted they did not desire.\n\nThe Second Continental Congress issued a response to the Proclamation on December 6, saying that while they had always been loyal to the king, the British Parliament never had any legitimate claim to authority over them, because the colonies were not democratically represented. Congress argued that it was their duty to continue resisting Parliament's violations of the British Constitution, and that they would retaliate if any supporters in Great Britain were punished for \"favouring, aiding, or abetting the cause of American liberty\". Congress maintained that they still hoped to avoid the \"calamities\" of a \"civil war\".\n\nThe Proclamation and the Speech from the Throne undermined moderates in the Continental Congress such as John Dickinson, who had been arguing that the king would find a way to resolve the dispute between the colonies and Parliament. When it became clear that the king was not inclined to act as a conciliator, colonial attachment to the Empire was weakened, and a movement towards declaring independence became a reality, culminating in the United States Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.\n\n"}

{"id": "188168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188168", "title": "Records of the Grand Historian", "text": "Records of the Grand Historian\n\nThe Records of the Grand Historian, also known by its Chinese name Shiji, is a monumental history of ancient China and the world finished around 94 BC by the Han dynasty official Sima Qian after having been started by his father, Sima Tan, Grand Astrologer to the imperial court. The work covers the world as it was then known to the Chinese and a 2500-year period from the age of the legendary Yellow Emperor to the reign of Emperor Wu of Han in the author's own time.\n\nThe \"Records\" has been called a \"foundational text in Chinese civilization\". After Confucius and the First Emperor of Qin, \"Sima Qian was one of the creators of Imperial China, not least because by providing definitive biographies, he virtually created the two earlier figures.\" The \"Records\" set the model for the 24 subsequent dynastic histories of China. In contrast to Western historical works, the \"Records\" do not treat history as \"a continuous, sweeping narrative\", but rather break it up into smaller, overlapping units dealing with famous leaders, individuals, and major topics of significance.\n\nThe work that became \"Records of the Grand Historian\" was begun by Sima Tan, the Grand Astrologer (\"Taishi\" ) of the Han dynasty court during the late 2nd century. After his death in 110, it was continued and completed by his son and successor Sima Qian, who is generally credited as the work's author. Sima Qian is known to have completed the \"Records\" before his death in c. 86, with one copy residing in the imperial capital of Chang'an (modern Xi'an) and the other copy probably being stored in his home. \n\nDetails of the \"Records\" early reception and circulation are not well known. A number of 1st century BC authors, such as the scholar Chu Shaosun (; fl. 327), added interpolations to the \"Records\", and may have had to reconstruct portions of it: ten of the original 130 chapters were lost in the Eastern Han period (AD 25220) and seem to have been reconstructed later.\n\nBeginning in the Northern and Southern dynasties (420589) and the Tang dynasty (607918), a number of scholars wrote and edited commentaries to the \"Records\". Most 1st millennium editions of the \"Records\" include the commentaries of Pei Yin (, 5th century), Sima Zhen (early 8th century), and Zhang Shoujie (, early 8th century). The primary modern edition of the \"Records\" is the Zhonghua Book Company edition of 1959 (revised in 1982), and is based on an edition prepared by the Chinese historian Gu Jiegang in the early 1930s.\n\nThere are two known surviving fragments of \"Records\" manuscripts from before the Tang dynasty, both of which are preserved in the Ishiyama-dera temple in Ōtsu, Japan. Portions of at least nine Tang dynasty manuscripts survive: three fragments discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the early 20th century, and six manuscripts preserved in Japanese temples and museums, such as the Kōzan-ji temple in Kyoto and the Tōyō Bunko museum in Tokyo. A number of woodblock printed editions of the \"Records\" survive, the earliest of which date to the Song dynasty (9601297).\n\nIn all, the \"Records\" is about 526,000 Chinese characters long, making it four times longer than Thucydides' \"History of the Peloponnesian War\" and longer than the Old Testament.\n\nSima Qian conceived and composed his work in self-contained units, with a good deal of repetition between them. His manuscript was written on bamboo slips with about 24 to 36 characters each, and assembled into bundles of around 30 slips. Even after the manuscript was allowed to circulate or be copied, the work would have circulated as bundles of bamboo slips or small groups. Endymion Wilkinson calculates that there were probably between 466 and 700 bundles, whose total weight would have been , which would have been difficult to access and hard to transport. Later copies on silk would have been much lighter, but also expensive and rare. Until the work was transferred to paper many centuries later, circulation would have been difficult and piecemeal, which accounts for many of the errors and variations in the text.\n\nSima Qian organized the chapters of \"Records of the Grand Historian\" into five categories, which each comprise a section of the book.\n\n\nUnlike subsequent official historical texts that adopted Confucian doctrine, proclaimed the divine rights of the emperors, and degraded any failed claimant to the throne, Sima Qian's more liberal and objective prose has been renowned and followed by poets and novelists. Most volumes of \"Liezhuan\" are vivid descriptions of events and persons. Sima Qian sought out stories from those who might have closer knowledge of certain historical events, using them as sources to balance the reliability and accuracy of historical records. For instance, the material on Jing Ke's attempt at assassinating the King of Qin incorporates an eye-witness account by Xia Wuju (), a physician to the king of Qin who happened to be attending the diplomatic ceremony for Jing Ke, and this account was passed on to Sima Qian by those who knew Xia.\n\nIt has been observed that the diplomatic Sima Qian has a way of accentuating the positive in his treatment of rulers in the Basic Annals, but slipping negative information into other chapters, and so his work must be read as a whole to obtain full information. For example, the information that Liu Bang (later Emperor Gaozu of Han), in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from Xiang Yu's men, pushed his own children off his carriage to lighten it, was not given in the emperor's biography, but in the biography of Xiang Yu. He is also careful to balance the negative with the positive, for example, in the biography of Empress Dowager Lu which contains lurid accounts of her cruelty, he pointed out at the end that, despite whatever her personal life may have been, her rule brought peace and prosperity to the country.\n\nSima's family were hereditary historians to the Han emperor. Sima Qian's father Sima Tan served as Grand Historian, and Sima Qian succeeded to his position. Thus he had access to the early Han dynasty archives, edicts, and records. Sima Qian was a methodical, skeptical historian who had access to ancient books, written on bamboo and wooden slips, from before the time of the Han dynasty. Many of the sources he used did not survive. He not only used archives and imperial records, but also interviewed people and traveled around China to verify information. In his first chapter, \"Annals of the Five Emperors,\" he writes,\n\nThe Grand Historian used \"The Annals of the Five Emperors\" () and the \"Classic of History\" as source materials to make genealogies from the time of the Yellow Emperor until that of the Gonghe regency (841-828 BC). Sima Qian often cites his sources. For example, in the first chapter, \"Annals of the Five Emperors\", he writes, \"I have read the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" and the \"Guoyu\".\" In his 13th chapter, \"Genealogical Table of the Three Ages,\" Sima Qian writes, \"I have read all the genealogies of the kings (\"dieji\" ) that exist since the time of the Yellow Emperor.\" In his 14th chapter, \"Yearly Chronicle of the Feudal Lords\", he writes, \"I have read all the royal annals (\"chunqiu li pudie\" ) up until the time of King Li of Zhou.\" In his 15th chapter, \"Yearly Chronicle of the Six States,\" he writes, “I have read the Annals of Qin (\"qin ji\" ), and they say that the Quanrong [a barbarian tribe] defeated King You of Zhou [ca 771 BC].\"\n\nIn the 19th chapter, he writes, \"I have occasion to read over the records of enfeoffment and come to the case of Wu Qian, the marquis of Bian...\" (The father of Marquis Bian, Wu Rui, was named king (wang) of Changsha in Hunan for his loyalty to Gaozu. See article on Zhao Tuo). In his chapter on the patriotic minister and poet Qu Yuan, Sima Qian writes, \"I have read [Qu Yuan's works] \"Li Sao\", \"Tianwen\" (\"Heaven Asking\"), \"Zhaohun\" (summoning the soul), and \"Ai Ying\" (Lament for Ying)\". In the 62nd chapter, \"Biography of Guan and of Yan\", he writes, \"I have read Guan's \"Mu Min\" ( - \"Government of the People\", a chapter in the \"Guanzi\"), \"Shan Gao\" (\"The Mountains Are High\"), \"Chengma\" (chariot and horses; a long section on war and economics), \"Qingzhong\" (Light and Heavy; i.e. \"what is important\"), and \"Jiufu\" (Nine Houses), as well as the \"Spring and Autumn Annals of Yanzi\".\" In his 64th chapter, \"Biography of Sima Rangju\", the Grand Historian writes, \"I have read Sima's Art of War.\" In the 121st chapter, \"Biographies of Scholars\", he writes, \"I read the Imperial Decrees that encouraged education officials.\"\nSima Qian wrote of the problems with incomplete, fragmentary and contradictory sources. For example, he mentioned in the preface to chapter 15 that the chronicle records of the feudal states kept in the Zhou dynasty's archive were burnt by Qin Shi Huang because they contained criticisms and ridicule of the Qin state, and that the Qin annals were brief and incomplete. In the 13th chapter he mentioned that the chronologies and genealogies of different ancient texts \"disagree and contradict each other throughout\". In his 18th chapter, Sima Qian writes, \"I have set down only what is certain, and in doubtful cases left a blank.\"\n\nScholars have questioned the historicity of legendary kings of the ancient periods given by Sima Qian. Sima Qian began the \"Shiji\" with an account of the five rulers of supreme virtue, the Five Emperors, who modern scholars, such as those from the Doubting Antiquity School, believe to be originally local deities of the peoples of ancient China. Sima Qian sifted out the elements of the supernatural and fantastic which seemed to contradict their existence as actual human monarchs, and was therefore criticized for turning myths and folklore into sober history.\n\nHowever, according to Joseph Needham, who wrote in 1954 on Sima Qian's accounts of the kings of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–c. 1050 BC): \n\nWhile some aspects of Sima Qian's history of the Shang dynasty are supported by inscriptions on the oracle bones, there is, as yet, no clear corroborating evidence from archaeology on Sima Qian's history of the Xia dynasty.\n\nThere are also discrepancies of fact such as dates between various portions of the work. This may be a result of Sima Qian's use of different source texts.\n\nAfter ca. 91 BC, the more-or-less completed manuscript was hidden in the residence of the author's daughter, Sima Ying (), to avoid destruction under Emperor Wu and his immediate successor Emperor Zhao. The \"Shiji\" was finally disseminated during the reign of Emperor Xuan by Sima Qian's grandson (through his daughter), Yang Yun (), after a hiatus of around twenty years.\n\nThe changes in the manuscript of the \"Shiji\" during this hiatus have always been disputed among scholars. That the text was more or less complete by ca. 91 BC is established in the Letter to Ren'an (), composed in the Zhenghe () era of Emperor Wu's reign. In this letter, Sima Qian describes his work as \"spanning from the time of the Yellow Emperor to the present age and consisting of ten tables, twelve basic annals, eight treatises, thirty chapters on hereditary houses, and seventy biographies, together totaling 130 chapters.\" These numbers are likewise given in the postface to \"Shiji\".\n\nAfter his death (presumably only a few years later), few people had the opportunity to see the whole work. However, various additions were still made to it. The historian Liu Zhiji reported the names of a total of fifteen scholars supposed to have added material to the \"Shiji\" during the period after the death of Sima Qian. Only the additions by Chu Shaosun (, c.105 - c.30 BC) are clearly indicated by adding \"Mr Chu said,\" (Chu xiansheng yue, ). Already in the first century AD, Ban Biao and Ban Gu claimed that ten chapters in \"Records of the Grand Historian\" were lacking. A large number of chapters dealing with the first century of the Han dynasty (i.e. the 2nd century BC) correspond exactly to the relevant chapters from the \"Book of Han\" (\"Hanshu\"). It is unclear whether those chapters initially came from the \"Shiji\" or from the \"Hanshu\". Researchers Yves Hervouet (1921-1999) and A.F.P. Hulsewé argued that the originals of those chapters of the \"Shiji\" were lost and they were later reconstructed using the corresponding chapters from the \"Hanshu\".\n\nThe earliest extant copy of \"Records of the Grand Historian\", handwritten, was made during the Southern and Northern Dynasties period (420 – 589 AD). The earliest printed edition, called \"Shiji jijie\" (, literally \"Records of the Grand Historian, Collected Annotations\"), was published during the Northern Song dynasty. Huang Shanfu's edition, printed under the Southern Song dynasty, is the earliest collection of the \"Sanjiazhu\" commentaries on \"Records of the Grand Historian\" (, literally: \"The Combined Annotations of the Three Experts\").\n\nIn modern times, the Zhonghua Book Company in Beijing has published the book in both simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese editions. The 1959 (2nd ed., 1982) \"Sanjiazhu\" edition (based upon the Jinling Publishing House edition, \"vide infra\") contains commentaries interspersed among the main text and is considered to be an authoritative modern edition.\n\nThe most well known editions of the \"Shiji\" are:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The pages for each month of the year were accompanied by advice on what, and what not to eat and drink, and otherwise how to keep in good health. There were horticultural notes with abundant attention paid to herbs, fruit and vegetables.\n\nThe lengthiest sections of this little book listed annual fairs in England and Wales of fixed and moveable date. The first would generally be associated with a saint's day, while the second would be of the type \"second Monday in October\". This list of town names and dates represented important information in the days before Agricultural Advisers, Trade Fairs and Job Offices, when the fairs played an important role not only in buying and selling, but also in exhibiting innovations in husbandry, in information exchange and in the hiring of labor.\n\nIt is generally held that Cardanus Rider is a pseudonym, and near-anagram: the letters rearrange as Ric_ard Saunder_. Richard Saunders was an English physician and astrologer, born in 1613, and who died (sources differ) either in 1675, 1687, or 1692.\n\nThe National Archives in London hold a book by Saunders on palmistry, with horoscopes; also attributed to him is \"The Astrological Judgment and Practice of Physick\", published in 1677, although the fact that it includes charts from as early as 1616 to 1618 has led doubts to be cast on the actual authorship. Be that as it may, its subject matter was dear to the heart of \"Cardanus Rider\"; it stands as one of the earliest astro-medical treatises in the English language. Using the terminology of his day, the writer speaks of humours and winds, of conditions hot, cold or dry, of the cholerick and melancholy, of illnesses produced by the planets in the various signs of the zodiac, when to administer medicines based on planetary hours, and much more.\n\n"}
{"id": "5339439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5339439", "title": "Royal cypher", "text": "Royal cypher\n\nIn modern heraldry, a royal cypher is a monogram-like device of a country's reigning sovereign, typically consisting of the initials of the monarch's name and title, sometimes interwoven and often surmounted by a crown. Where such a cypher is used by an emperor or empress, it is called an \"imperial cypher\". In the system used by various Commonwealth realms, the title is abbreviated as \"R\" for \"rex\" or \"regina\" (Latin for \"king\" and \"queen\"). Previously, \"I\" stood for \"imperator\" or \"imperatrix\" (Latin words for \"emperor\" and \"empress\") of India. The cypher is displayed on some government buildings, impressed upon royal and state documents, and is used by government departments.\n\nThe use of a royal cypher in the Commonwealth realms originates in the United Kingdom, where the public use of the royal initials dates at least from the early Tudor period, and was simply the initial of the sovereign with, after Henry VIII's reign, the addition of the letter \"R\" for \"Rex\" or \"Regina\". The letter \"I\" for \"Imperatrix\" was added to Queen Victoria's monogram after she became Empress of India in 1877. The initials which had no set pattern or form of lettering laid down were usually shown in company with the royal arms or crown as on the king's manors and palaces such as those of Henry VIII on the gatehouse of St James's Palace. The purpose seems to have been simply to identify an individual sovereign, as the royal coat of arms was often used by successive monarchs. The initials were used mostly on government papers, duty stamps and similar objects, and were sometimes surmounted by a stylised version of the Tudor Crown or, more recently, St Edward's Crown. In Scotland, the Crown of Scotland appears in place of the Imperial Crown.\n\nThough royal symbols differ among the sixteen Commonwealth realms, as they are separate monarchies, the one sovereign uses the same cypher throughout all of his or her countries. Distinction continues to be made between the personal cypher and the simpler, more workaday public initials, the former being the sovereign's own monogram and the latter simply a means of identifying a reign. Nowadays, the initials are also called the royal cypher, but, to aid clarification, the monogram is referred to as the royal cypher interlaced and reversed.\n\nThe present Queen's cypher is \"ER\", standing for \"Elizabeth II Regina\". Cyphers for other members of the Royal Family are designed by the College of Arms or Court of the Lord Lyon and are subsequently approved by the Queen. These cyphers have been incorporated by the Canadian Heraldic Authority into the various royal standards of Canada. The use in Canada of the reigning monarch's cypher, which is sometimes uniquely surrounded by a garland of maple leaves, is as a symbol not only of the sovereign him or herself, but of Canada's full sovereignty as well. \nIts also found on post offices and some government buildings Australia.\n\nOther royal houses have also made use of royal or imperial cyphers. Ottoman sultans had a calligraphic signature, their tughra.\n\nAll the monarchs of Europe's six other surviving kingdoms use cyphers, with royal crowns above them. Harald V of Norway uses the letter H crossed with the Arabic numeral 5; Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden uses the letters C and G overlapping with the Roman numeral XVI below them; Felipe VI of Spain uses the letter F with the Roman numeral; and Margrethe II of Denmark uses the letter M with the Arabic numeral 2 and the letter R (for Regina) below it. Philippe of Belgium uses the letters P and F intertwined, referring to the fact that his name is Philippe in French, but Filip in Dutch, the two main languages in Belgium. Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and his Queen Maxima share a joint cypher consisting of the letter W entwined with the letter M.\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn of Thailand uses a cypher made up of his initials in Thai script (\"ว.ป.ร.\" VPR Vajiralongkorn Parama Rajadhiraj, an equivalent of Vajirarongkorn Rex).\n\n"}

Schostal.\n\nThe Agency represented 408 photographers. Some are still of renown, such as Trude Fleischmann, Kitty Hoffmann, , Dr , Karel Hájek, Heinrich Hoffmann, Georges Sand, , Bert Longworth, Germaine Krull, Yva, Madame d'Ora and Lotte Jacobi. Especially for the latter Jewish photographers, Schostal was one of the few business to circumvent the Nazi Reich Chamber of Culture (nationalsozialistische Reichskulturkammer) ban on their employment.\n\nSchostal Photo Agency (Agentur Schostal) was founded in 1929 with the aim of producing and distributing photographs both locally and globally. With more than one million photos covering a wide variety of subjects, it was one of the great agencies of the 1920s and 1930s. The headquarters were in Wieden, the 4th district of Vienna in the former office of Wiener Photo-Kurier. Schostal had representatives and offices in major European cities Paris, Milan, Berlin and Stockholm.\n\nThe main customers were print media, including magazines such as \"Die Dame\", \"Die Woche\" and \"Uhu\" in Austria, \"Moderne Welt\", \", \" and \"Wiener Magazin\" to which Schostal supplied images relating to culture, fashion and glamor. From 1929 it was the Austrian representative of the Keystone Press Agency (London, New York).\n\nIn March 1938 German troops invaded Austria. Robert Schostal quickly made a bid to flee the country for Paris where his brother lived, leaving behind the Schostal Agency photographs, but was betrayed and arrested in Klagenfurt. He was released after Studio Madame d'Ora made representations on his behalf, paying for a visa for him and his mother to come to France, though he instead traveled to the United States. Walter Schostal arranged for customers outside of Germany and Austria to invoice their office in Paris instead of Vienna, but with France's declaration of war in 1939, the Paris branch had to close and in 1941 the entire Schostal family reunited in New York.\n\nin Vienna, though his close relations with Nazi officials of the Reichspressekammer Friedrich Gondosch, also a photographer and whose pictures are in the collection, was able to take over the Schostal agency. The photographs were subsequently used for propaganda, rebranded with the stamp \"Wien Bild\" followed by the banner \"P.P.P. Photos für Presse und Propaganda\" ('PPP photos for press and propaganda').\n\nAfter the Second World War, in 1948, the agency, which was then under Soviet control, closed. Robert made unsuccessful efforts from America to recover the archive. However, some of the photos were hidden in a basement, and Friedrich Gondosch vanished, perhaps fearing reprisal.\n\nIn 1992, an unnamed Swiss art dealer discovered approximately 130,000 well-preserved photographs bearing the Schostal Agency stamp, more than 40 years after the agency went out of business in 1948. Parts of the collection that were discovered in 1992 were sold or auctioned off to various institutions. The German Historical Museum bought 40,000 photos in 1995, The Hamburg Museum of Arts and Crafts bought 350 fashion photographs, and some went to the Austrian National Library.\n\nIsolated prints bearing the Schostal agency stamp have surfaced intermittently at art auctions. A bulk of the photographs are owned by the Austrian publisher , the founder of IMAGNO Brandstätter Institute, a leading historical picture agency in Austria that has 300,000 Schostal photographs in their holdings. How this company acquired the majority of photographs is unknown, as the number in its collection surpasses the 130,000 prints discovered in 1992.\n\nA portion of this collection, 5,066 gelatin silver prints, 58 information sheets, and 34 photograph envelopes made between 1927 and 1945, was anonymously donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) in 2008.\n\n"}

Dated between December 1966 and February 2010, the cables contain diplomatic analysis from world leaders, and the diplomats' assessment of host countries and their officials. According to WikiLeaks, the 251,287 cables consist of 261,276,536 words, making Cablegate \"the largest set of confidential documents ever to be released into the public domain.\" Today, more recent leaks have surpassed that amount. On July 30, 2013, Chelsea Manning was convicted for theft of the cables and violations of the Espionage Act, in a court martial proceeding, and sentenced to 35 years imprisonment. She was released on May 17, 2017, after 7 years total confinement, after her sentence had been commuted by President Obama earlier that year. \n\nThe first document, the so-called Reykjavik 13 cable, was released by WikiLeaks on 18 February 2010, and was followed by the release of State Department profiles of Icelandic politicians a month later. Later that year, Julian Assange, WikiLeaks' editor-in-chief, reached an agreement with media partners in Europe and the United States to publish the rest of the cables in redacted form, removing the names of sources and others in vulnerable positions. On 28 November, the first 220 cables were published under this agreement by \"El País\" (Spain), \"Der Spiegel\" (Germany), \"Le Monde\" (France), \"The Guardian\" (United Kingdom) and \"The New York Times\" (United States). WikiLeaks had planned to release the rest over several months, and as of 11 January 2011, 2,017 had been published.\n\nThe remaining cables were published in September 2011 after a series of events compromised the security of a WikiLeaks file containing the cables. This included WikiLeaks volunteers placing an encrypted file containing all WikiLeaks data online as \"insurance\" in July 2010, in case something happened to the organization. In February 2011 David Leigh of \"The Guardian\" published the encryption passphrase in a book; he had received it from Assange so he could access a copy of the Cablegate file, and believed the passphrase was a temporary one, unique to that file. In August 2011, a German magazine, \"Der Freitag\", published some of these details, enabling others to piece the information together and decrypt the Cablegate files. The cables were then available online, fully unredacted. In response, WikiLeaks decided on 1 September 2011 to publish all 251,287 unedited documents.\n\nThe publication of the cables was the third in a series of U.S. classified document \"mega-leaks\" distributed by WikiLeaks in 2010, following the Afghan War documents leak in July, and the Iraq War documents leak in October. Over 130,000 of the cables are unclassified, some 100,000 are labeled \"confidential\", around 15,000 have the higher classification \"secret\", and none are classified as \"top secret\" on the classification scale. Reactions to the leak in 2010 varied. Western governments expressed strong disapproval, while the material generated intense interest from the public and journalists. Some political leaders referred to Assange as a criminal, while blaming the U.S. Department of Defense for security lapses. Supporters of Assange referred to him in November 2010 as a key defender of free speech and freedom of the press. Reaction to the release in September 2011 of the unredacted cables attracted stronger criticism, and was condemned by the five newspapers that had first published the cables in redacted form in November 2010.\n\nIn June 2010, the magazine \"Wired\" reported that the U.S. State Department and embassy personnel were concerned that Chelsea (then Bradley) Manning, a United States Army soldier charged with the unauthorized download of classified material while stationed in Iraq, had leaked diplomatic cables. WikiLeaks rejected the report as inaccurate: \"Allegations in \"Wired\" that we have been sent 260,000 classified U.S. embassy cables are, as far as we can tell, incorrect\".\n\nHowever, during that same month (June 2010), \"The Guardian\" had been offered \"half a million military dispatches from the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. There might be more after that, including an immense bundle of confidential diplomatic cables\", and Alan Rusbridger, the editor of \"The Guardian\" had contacted Bill Keller, editor of \"The New York Times\", to see if he would be interested in sharing the dissemination of the information.\n\nManning was suspected to have uploaded all that was obtained to WikiLeaks, which chose to release the material in stages so as to have the greatest possible impact.\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", all the diplomatic cables were marked \"Sipdis\", denoting \"secret internet protocol distribution\", which means they had been distributed via the closed U.S. SIPRNet, the U.S. Department of Defense's classified version of the civilian internet. More than three million U.S. government personnel and soldiers have access to this network. Documents marked \"top secret\" are not included in the system. Such a large quantity of secret information was available to a wide audience because, as \"The Guardian\" alleged, after the 11 September attacks an increased focus had been placed on sharing information since gaps in intra-governmental information sharing had been exposed. More specifically, the diplomatic, military, law enforcement and intelligence communities would be able to do their jobs better with this easy access to analytic and operative information. A spokesman said that in the previous weeks and months additional measures had been taken to improve the security of the system and prevent leaks.\n\nOn 22 November, an announcement was made via WikiLeaks's \"Twitter\" feed that the next release would be \"7× the size of the Iraq War Logs\". U.S. authorities and the media had speculated, at the time, that they could contain diplomatic cables. Prior to the expected leak, the government of the United Kingdom (UK) sent a DA-Notice to UK newspapers, which requested advance notice from newspapers regarding the expected publication. Index on Censorship pointed out that \"there is no obligation on [the] media to comply\". Under the terms of a DA-Notice, \"[n]ewspaper editors would speak to [the] Defence, Press and Broadcasting Advisory Committee prior to publication\". \"The Guardian\" was revealed to have been the source of the copy of the documents given to \"The New York Times\" in order to prevent the British government from obtaining any injunction against its publication. The Pakistani newspaper \"Dawn\" stated that the U.S. newspapers \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" were expected to publish parts of the diplomatic cables on 28 November, including 94 Pakistan-related documents.\n\nOn 26 November, Assange sent a letter to the U.S. Department of State, via his lawyer Jennifer Robinson, inviting them to \"privately nominate any specific instances (record numbers or names) where it considers the publication of information would put individual persons at significant risk of harm that has not already been addressed\". Harold Koh, the Legal Adviser of the Department of State, rejected the proposal, stating: \"We will not engage in a negotiation regarding the further release or dissemination of illegally obtained U.S. Government classified materials\". Assange responded by writing back to the U.S. State Department that \"you have chosen to respond in a manner which leads me to conclude that the supposed risks are entirely fanciful and you are instead concerned to suppress evidence of human rights abuse and other criminal behaviour\". Ahead of the leak, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other American officials contacted governments in several countries about the impending release.\n\nThe five newspapers that had obtained an advance copy of all leaked cables began releasing the cables on 28 November 2010, and WikiLeaks made the cables selected by these newspapers and redacted by their journalists available on its website. \"They are releasing the documents we selected\", \"Le Monde\"s managing editor, Sylvie Kauffmann, said in an interview.\n\nWikiLeaks aimed to release the cables in phases over several months due to their global scope and significance. The first batch of leaks released comprised 220 cables. Further cables were subsequently made available on the WikiLeaks website. The full set of cables published by WikiLeaks can be browsed and searched by a variety of websites, see Sites offering search capabilities.\n\nThe contents of the U.S. diplomatic cables leak describe in detail events and incidents surrounding international affairs from 274 embassies dating from 28 December 1966 to 28 February 2010. The diplomatic cables revealed numerous unguarded comments and revelations: critiques and praises about the host countries of various U.S. embassies, discussion and resolutions towards ending ongoing tension in the Middle East, efforts for and resistance against nuclear disarmament, actions in the War on Terror, assessments of other threats around the world, dealings between various countries, U.S. intelligence and counterintelligence efforts, U.S. support of dictatorship and other diplomatic actions.\n\nThe leaked cables revealed that diplomats of the U.S. and Britain eavesdropped on Secretary General Kofi Annan in the weeks before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, in apparent violation of international treaties prohibiting spying at the UN.\n\n\"The Guardian\" released its coverage of the leaked cables in numerous articles, including an interactive database, starting on 28 November.\n\n\"Der Spiegel\" also released its preliminary report, with extended coverage promised for the next day. Its cover for 29 November was also leaked with the initial report.\n\n\"The New York Times\" initially covered the story in a nine-part series spanning nine days, with the first story published simultaneously with the other outlets. \"The New York Times\" was not originally intended to receive the leak, allegedly due to its unflattering portrayal of the site's founder, but \"The Guardian\" decided to share coverage, citing earlier cooperation while covering the Afghan and Iraqi war logs.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" reported that it also requested permission to see the documents, but was rejected for undisclosed reasons.\n\n\"El País\" released its report saying there was an agreement between the newspapers for simultaneous publication of the \"internationally relevant\" documents, but that each newspaper was free to select and treat those documents that primarily relate to its own country.\n\nSeveral of the newspapers coordinating with WikiLeaks have published some of the cables on their own websites.\n\nThe Lebanese daily newspaper \"Al-Akhbar\" published about 183 cables on 2 December 2010.\n\nThe Swedish newspapers \"Svenska Dagbladet\" and \"Aftonbladet\" started reporting on the leaks early December. In Norway \"Verdens Gang\" (\"VG\") brought the first leaks concerning the United States and the Norwegian government on 7 December.\n\n\"Aftenposten\", a Norwegian daily newspaper, reported on 17 December 2010 that it had gained access to the full cable set of 251,287 documents. While it is unclear how it received the documents, they were apparently not obtained directly from WikiLeaks. \"Aftenposten\" started releasing cables that are not available in the official WikiLeaks distribution. , it had released just over one hundred cables unpublished by WikiLeaks, with about a third of these related to Sri Lanka, and many related to Norway.\n\n\"Politiken\", a Danish daily newspaper, announced on 8 January 2011 that it had obtained access to the full set of cables.\n\n\"NRC\", a Dutch daily newspaper, and RTL Nieuws, a Dutch television news service, announced on 14 January 2011 that they had gained access to the about 3,000 cables sent from The Hague, via Aftenposten. \"NOS\" announced on the same day that it had obtained these same cables from Wikileaks.\n\n\"Die Welt\", a German daily newspaper, announced on 17 January 2011 that they had gained access to the full set of cables, via Aftenposten.\n\nAustralian-based Fairfax Media obtained access to the cables under a separate arrangement. Fairfax newspapers began releasing their own stories based on the leaked cables on 7 December 2010. Unlike other newspapers given access, Fairfax originally had not posted any of the original cables online, citing the need to maintain its competitive advantage over other Australian newspapers. However, on 16 December 2010, Fairfax reversed its position, and began publishing the cables used in its stories.\n\nThe Russian weekly newspaper \"Russky Reporter\" (\"\") has published a large number of cables, both in English and in Russian translation.\n\nThe Cuban government-run website Razones de Cuba started publishing Spanish translations of WikiLeaks documents on 23 December 2010.\n\nThe Costa Rican newspaper \"La Nación\" announced on 1 March 2011 it had received 827 cables from WikiLeaks which it started publishing the next day. 764 of these were sent from the U.S. Embassy in San José while 63 were sent from other embassies and deal with Costa Rican affairs.\n\nCNN was originally supposed to receive an advance copy of the documents as well, but did not after it refused to sign a confidentiality agreement with WikiLeaks. \"The Wall Street Journal\" also refused advance access, apparently for similar reasons as CNN.\n\nThe Ecuadorian newspaper \"El Universo\" started releasing 343 cables related to the Ecuadorian government or institutions on 6 April 2011. The publication was done the day after the Spanish newspaper \"El País\" published a cable in which the ambassador Heather Hodges showed concerns regarding corruption in the Ecuadorian National Police, especially of Gral. Jaime Hurtado Vaca, former Police commander. The ambassador was later declared \"persona non grata\" and requested to leave the country as soon as possible.\n\nIn August 2010, Assange gave \"Guardian\" journalist David Leigh an encryption key and a URL where he could locate the full Cablegate file. In February 2011, shortly before Domscheit-Berg's book appeared, he and Luke Harding, another \"Guardian\" journalist, published \"\" via Guardian Books. In it, Leigh revealed the encryption key Assange had given him.\n\nThe key to the document is: .\n\nIt is not yet clear how or when the encrypted file itself was released inadvertently. So far it appears that it was released to bittorrent as part of a mirror file for the WikiLeaks web server on which it had been placed to aid in transferring the file from WikiLeaks to Leigh, and either not removed due to oversight, or mirrored by other WikiLeaks staff before it could be removed. The password leaked in Leigh's book is not the password for the whole of the \"insurance file\" which WikiLeaks published in a separate event. It also remains unclear if during the transfer process the file was exposed publicly under the assumption that it is acceptable to transfer an encrypted file in plain sight so long as the key remains secret. \n\nOn 25 August 2011, the German magazine \"Der Freitag\" published an article about it, and while it left out the crucial details, there was enough to allow others to piece the information together. The story was also published in the Danish newspaper \"Dagbladet Information\" the same day. By 1 September, the encrypted Cablegate file had been decrypted and published by a Twitter user, and WikiLeaks therefore decided to publish all the diplomatic cables unredacted. Their reasoning, according to Glenn Greenwald in \"Salon\", was that government intelligence agencies were able to find and read the files, while ordinary people-including journalists, whistleblowers, and those directly affected-were not. WikiLeaks took the view that sources could better protect themselves if the information were equally available. The archive includes 34,687 files on Iraq, 8,003 on Kuwait, 9,755 on Australia, and 12,606 on Egypt. According to \"The Guardian\", it includes more than 1,000 cables containing the names of individual activists, and around 150 identifying whistleblowers.\n\nLeigh disclaimed responsibility for the release, saying Assange had assured him the password would expire hours after it was disclosed to him. \"The Guardian\" wrote that the decision to publish the cables was made by Assange alone, a decision that it-and its four previous media partners-condemned. The partners released a joint statement saying the uncensored publication put sources at risk of dismissal, detention and physical harm, while other commentators have agreed with WikiLeaks' rationale for the release of unredacted cables. Leigh was criticized by several commentators, including Glenn Greenwald, who called the publication of the password \"reckless\", arguing that, even if it had been a temporary one, publishing it divulged the type of passwords WikiLeaks was using. WikiLeaks said it was pursuing pre-litigation action against \"The Guardian\" for an alleged breach of a confidentiality agreement.\n\nAn investigation into two senior Zimbabwe army commanders who communicated with US Ambassador Charles A. Ray was launched, with the two facing a possible court martial. On September 14 the Committee to Protect Journalists said that an Ethiopian journalist named in the cables was forced to flee the country but WikiLeaks accused the CPJ of distorting the situation \"for marketing purposes\". Al Jazeera replaced its news director, Wadah Khanfar, on September 20 after he was identified in the cables. The naming of mainland China residents reportedly \"sparked an online witch-hunt by Chinese nationalist groups, with some advocating violence against those now known to have met with U.S. Embassy staff.\"\n\nAbout an hour prior to the planned release of the initial documents, WikiLeaks announced it was experiencing a massive distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS), but vowed to still release the cables and documents via pre-agreed prominent media outlets \"El País\", \"Le Monde\", \"Der Spiegel\", \"The Guardian\", and \"The New York Times\".\n\nAccording to Arbor Networks, an Internet-analyst group, the DDoS attack accounted for between two and four gigabits per second (Gbit/s) of additional traffic to the WikiLeaks host network, compared to an average traffic of between twelve and fifteen Gbit/s under ordinary conditions. The attack was slightly more powerful than ordinary DDoS attacks, though well below the maximum of 60 to 100 Gbit/s of other major attacks during 2010. The attack was claimed to have been carried out by a person by the name of \"Jester\", who describes himself as a \"hacktivist\". Jester took credit for the attack on Twitter, stating that WikiLeaks \"threaten[ed] the lives of our troops and 'other assets'\".\n\nOn 2 December 2010, EveryDNS, who provide a free DNS hosting service, dropped WikiLeaks from its entries, citing DDoS attacks that \"threatened the stability of its infrastructure\", but the site was copied and made available at many other addresses, an example of the Streisand effect.\n\nJohn Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote a tweet saying: \"The first serious infowar is now engaged. The field of battle is WikiLeaks. You are the troops.\"\n\nAmazon.com removed WikiLeaks from its servers on 1 December 2010 at 19:30 GMT, and the latter website was unreachable until 20:17 GMT when the site had defaulted to its Swedish servers, hosted by Bahnhof.\n\nU.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, among the members of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee who had questioned Amazon in private communication on the company's hosting of WikiLeaks and the illegally obtained documents, commended Amazon for the action; WikiLeaks, however, responded by stating on its official Twitter page that \"WikiLeaks servers at Amazon ousted. Free speech the land of the free—fine our $ are now spent to employ people in Europe\", and later that \"If Amazon are so uncomfortable with the first amendment, they should get out of the business of selling books\".\n\nOn December 2, 2010, Tableau Software withdraw its visualizations from the contents of the leak, stating that it was directly due to political pressure from Joe Lieberman.\n\nOn 4 December, Paypal cut off the account used by WikiLeaks to collect donations.\n\nOn 6 December, the Swiss bank PostFinance announced that it had frozen the assets of Assange; on the same day, MasterCard stopped payments to WikiLeaks, with Visa following them on 7 December.\n\nOfficial efforts by the U.S. government to limit access to, conversation about, and general spread of the cables leaked by WikiLeaks were revealed by leading media organizations. A 4 December 2010 article by MSNBC, reported that the Obama administration has warned federal government employees and students in educational institutions studying towards careers in public service that they must refrain from downloading or linking to any WikiLeaks documents. However, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley denied ordering students, stating, \"We do not control private networks. We have issued no authoritative instructions to people who are not employees of the Department of State.\" He said the warning was from an \"overzealous employee.\" According to a 3 December 2010 article in \"The Guardian\", access to WikiLeaks has been blocked for federal workers. The U.S. Library of Congress, the U.S. Commerce Department and other government agencies have confirmed that the ban is already in place.\n\nA spokesman for Columbia University confirmed on 4 December that its Office of Career Services sent an e-mail warning students at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs to refrain from accessing WikiLeaks cables and discussing this subject on the grounds that \"discourse about the documents would call into question your ability to deal with confidential information\". However, this was quickly retracted on the following day. SIPA Dean John Henry Coatsworth wrote that \"Freedom of information and expression is a core value of our institution, [...] thus, SIPA's position is that students have a right to discuss and debate any information in the public arena that they deem relevant to their studies or to their roles as global citizens, and to do so without fear of adverse consequences.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported on 14 December that the U.S. Air Force bars its personnel from access to news sites (such as those of \"The New York Times\" and \"The Guardian\") that publish leaked cables.\n\nOn 18 December, the Bank of America stopped handling payments for WikiLeaks. Bank of America is also blocking access to WikiLeaks from its internal network preventing employees from accessing WikiLeaks.\n\nIn response to perceived federal and corporate censorship of the cable leaks, internet group Anonymous attacked several of such websites via DDOS attacks. So far, the websites of the Swedish prosecutor, PostFinance (the Swiss post-office banking company), MasterCard and Visa have all been targeted.\n\nThe websites of the government of Zimbabwe were targeted by Anonymous with DDoS attacks due to censorship of the WikiLeaks documents. The websites of the government of Tunisia were targeted by Anonymous due to censorship of the WikiLeaks documents and the Tunisian revolution. Tunisians were reported to be assisting in these denial-of-service attacks launched by Anonymous. Anonymous's role in the DDoS attacks on the Tunisian government's websites have led to an upsurge of internet activism among Tunisians against the government. Anonymous released an online message denouncing the government clampdown on recent protests and posted it on the Tunisian government website. Anonymous has named their attacks as \"Operation Tunisia\". Anonymous successfully DDoSsed eight Tunisian government websites. They plan attacks in Internet Relay Chat networks. Someone attacked Anonymous's website with a DDoS on 5 January.\n\nOn 9 December 2010, major Pakistani newspapers (such as \"The News International\", \"The Express Tribune\" and the \"Daily Jang\") and television channels carried stories that claimed to detail U.S. diplomats' assessments of senior Indian generals as \"vain, egotistical and genocidal\", also saying \"India's government is secretly allied with Hindu fundamentalists\", and that \"Indian spies are covertly supporting Islamist militants in Pakistan's tribal belt and Balochistan.\" However, none of the cables revealed any such assessments. The claims were credited to an Islamabad-based news service agency that frequently ran pro-Pakistan Army stories.\n\nLater, \"The News International\" admitted the story \"was dubious and may have been planted\", and \"The Express Tribune\" offered \"profuse\" apologies to readers. Urdu-language papers such as the \"Daily Jang\", however, declined to retract the story.\n\nOn 14 December 2010, a U.S. federal court subpoenaed Twitter for extensive information regarding WikiLeaks, but also put on a gagging order. The order was said to be part of an \"ongoing criminal investigation\", and required information regarding the Twitter accounts of WikiLeaks, Assange, Manning, Rop Gonggrijp, Jacob Appelbaum and Birgitta Jonsdottir. According to \"Salon.com\" journalist Glenn Greenwald, the court \"gave Twitter three days to respond and barred the company from notifying anyone, including the users, of the existence of the Order.\" Twitter requested that it be allowed to notify the users, giving them ten days to object. The court order was unsealed on 5 January 2011, and Jonsdottir decided to publicly fight the order.\n\nElected representatives of Iceland have declared such actions by the U.S. government \"serious\", \"peculiar\", \"outlandish\", and akin to heavy breathing on the telephone. The published subpoena text demands \"you are to provide ... subscriber names, user names ... mailing addresses, residential addresses, business addresses ... telephone number[s] ... credit card or bank account number[s] ... billing records\", \"as well as 'destination email addresses and IP addresses\". As of 10 January 2011, there were 636,759 followers of the WikiLeaks Twitter feed with destination email addresses and IP addresses.\n\nThe cable leaks have been pointed to as a catalyst for the 2010–2011 Tunisian revolution and government overthrow. \"Foreign Policy\" magazine said, \"We might also count Tunisia as the first time that WikiLeaks pushed people over the brink.\" Additionally, \"The New York Times\" said, \"The protesters...found grist for the complaints in leaked cables from the United States Embassy in Tunisia, released by WikiLeaks, that detailed the self-dealing and excess of the president's family.\"\n\nIt is widely believed that the Tunisian revolution then spread to other parts of the Middle East, turning into the Arab Spring.\n\n\n"}

The Johnsons got several experts to investigate, and were advised that the problem was caused by the application of a weed spray called Krovar and were advised to rip out all the vines, remove 30 cm of topsoil, and replant the vines.\n\nWhen Mr Ware asked Mr Johnson if he has sprayed Krovar on the vines, he denied ever using it. However, during the trial, he admitted he had sprayed it about 10% of the orchard. A neighbor also testified at the trial that Johnson had told he that he had sprayed Krovar there as well.\n\nThe Wares eventually sued the Johnsons for the loss.\n\nAfter 23 days in court, the judge ruled that on the balance of probabilities that Johnson did use Krovar on the orchard, thus making Johnson liable for damages for this loss. Pritchard J said \"This provision relates to common mistake - where both parties labour under the same mistake. By requiring as a condition of relief that both parties be \"influenced in their respective decisions\", the Act cannot mean that both parties must be induced by the mistake to enter into the contract\". The judge awarded damages for loss of profits of $206,913.42, although the judge reduced this by $48,000 for the interest they owed the Johnsons for a mortgage on the farm.\n"}
{"id": "3308789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3308789", "title": "Zhongyuan Yinyun", "text": "Zhongyuan Yinyun\n\nZhongyuan Yinyun (), literally meaning \"Rhymes of the central plain\", is a rime book from the Yuan dynasty compiled by Zhou Deqing (周德清) in 1324. An important work for the study of historical Chinese phonology, it testifies many phonological changes from Middle Chinese to Old Mandarin, such as the reduction and disappearance of final stop consonants and the reorganization of the tones. Though often termed a \"rime dictionary\", the work does not provide meanings for its entries.\n\n\"Zhongyuan Yinyun\" continued the tradition of \"Qieyun\" and other rime books. However, due to the phonological changes took place from the Sui dynasty to the Yuan dynasty, the information needed to be updated in accordance with the then phonological system.\n\nFrom the middle of the 13th century to the end of the 14th century, Beiqu (北曲, Northern Verse) underwent quick development. The author of Sanqu, Zhou Deqing, delved into the research on Beiqu, discovering that it created many problems by not adhering to the rules of classical poetic composition. He thought that in order to better develop Beiqu, one would need to make a definite standard, especially in respect to language. According to his own experience, he was able to propose a set of rules for composing and reciting Běiqǔ, which came to be known as \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\".\n\nIn the earlier rime books, characters are first grouped by tone, then by rime. However, in \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\", the selected 5,866 characters, commonly rhymed in songs of the time, are first grouped into 19 rime groups, then further into four tonal groups: ping sheng yin (陰平 \"feminine level tone\"), ping sheng yang (陽平 \"masculine level tone\"), shang sheng (上聲 \"rising tone\"), qu sheng (去聲 \"departing tone\"). The traditional ru sheng (入聲 \"entering tone\") is assigned to three groups according to contemporary rules in some modern Ji-Lu Mandarin dialects. This novel way of dividing the traditional four tones is known as \"dividing the level tones into \"yin\" and \"yang\", assigning the entering tone to the other three tones\" (平分陰陽，入派三聲). \n\nWithin each rime-tonal group, homophonic characters are further grouped together, with each homophonic group separated by an empty circle. As a common character, whose pronunciation every literate person is supposed to know, is used to head each homophonic group, \"fanqie\" spelling is not employed, as in the earlier rime books, for indicating the pronunciations of the characters. \n\nZhou regarded the principal works of the Four Great Yuan Playwrights (元曲四大家 \"Yuanqu si dajia\") as foundational to verse in general; he considered their works to be \"rimes joined with nature, words able to connect with the language of the world\" (韻共守自然之音，字能通天下之語), and at the same time also distinguished where the playwrights used rimes in non-standard places.\n\nThe second half of the \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\", \"Zhèngyǔ Zuòcí Qǐlì\" (正語作詞起例), employs various examples to explain in detail both the rime charts' methods of use as well as issues concerning Beiqu's creation, standards and other aspects.\n\nIn respect to contemporaneous and later Beiqu works, \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\" has played a very strong guiding role; moreover, many later rhyme works have regarded it as a model on which they based their interpretations. Up until the flourishing of Nanqu (\"Southern Verse\"), \"Zhongyuan Yinyun\" still held a tremendous influence.\n\n\n"}
