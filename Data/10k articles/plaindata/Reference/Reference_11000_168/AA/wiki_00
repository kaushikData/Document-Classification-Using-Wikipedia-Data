{"id": "51415052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51415052", "title": "Astrodatabank", "text": "Astrodatabank\n\nAstrodatabank is a wiki website containing a collection of astrological data. The freely accessible database features the birth details and associated birth charts of public figures and mundane events. The collection was started by astrologer, Lois Rodden in 1979. Astrodatabank is currently owned and maintained by the Swiss company Astrodienst and is published in English.\n\nIn 1979, Lois Rodden started publishing birth data with her book, Profiles of Women. Eventually this led onto the formation of Astrodatabank. Mark McDonough developed the Astrodatabank database work using the astrology birth data collected by Lois Rodden over 40 years of research. Six months before Lois Rodden died, Lois named Pat Taglilatelo as her successor. The data collection of another lifelong collector, Edwin Charles Steinbrecher, was integrated into the database during the next two years.\n\nIn July 2005, McDonough gave Richard Smoot ownership of the company. Astrodatabank was later bought by the Swiss company Astrodienst AG, of Alois Treindl, in 2008, and converted into a wiki project and made freely accessible to all.\n\nAstrodatabank as a wiki was released on 12 March 2009, with 72,271 pages, in English. The names Astrodatabank, Astro-Databank, AstroDatabank, and ADB refer to the one and same project Astrodatabank.\n\nThe contents and data of the wiki have been recommended for the purpose of research related to astrological studies. The project has been referred to by the National Council for Geocosmic Research for astrological research and has been recommended by Astrological Association of Great Britain as a large collection of verified astrological charts and a useful resource for scientific research.\n\nResearchers have imported Astrodatabank birth chart data into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for analysis. They claim that Astrodatabank sets the standards for rigorous astrological methodology and meet social scientific research design standards.\n\nThe Astrodatabank has been used for astrological predictions by astrologers. The database has served as an important source of information related to notable people.\n\nResearch studies using Astrodatabank to replicate the original results of a successful test conducted by students of statistics class of Lake Forest College has been attempted. The information provided on Astrodatabank, has been used for work related to history, and for reference work.\n\nThe contents of Astrodatabank has details of time of an event or person, with a related biography, entry used also for studying the relation of charts to events in public lives.\n\nAstrodatabank has a variety of astrological data collections. The data includes the birth details of celebrities, public figures, and Royal births. The time and dates of significant events are also included.\n\n\"Editors\" and \"Astrological data collectors\" contribute to Astrodatabank entries. Entries are first reviewed by the main editor for reliability and notability, before publication.\n\nAstrodatabank birth entries are ranked according to the Lois Rodden Rating system. This requires full citation of \"source notes\" which detail the reference to the origin of the datum collected. Entries are updated to reflect the most recent and most accurate information. Originally the highest rating for accuracy was A. At the suggestion of Marion March, the AA category was included to distinguish between data based on personal memory and that supported by a birth certificate. The least reliable rating, DD refers to so called \"dirty data\". These are from a third rate source or where the datum is speculative or contradictory or dubious. A DD rating can apply to an entry with multiple claims of different birth data from equally reliable sources.\n\nA research article on the cognitive simulation of AstroDatabank records by using the Artificial Intelligence System – AIDOS, was published. The technology of simulation is described and the most important results are discussed.\n\nThe data from Astrodatabank has been used for statistical studies in Astrology and for studying patterns to account for human behavior. The Astrodatabank data has been referenced by authors and writers as a source of information and data, in magazines and in their published books.\n\nAstrodatabank uses the wiki software MediaWiki with some self-created extensions to provide astrological charts.\n\nThe global rank of Astrodatabank as of August 2016, was increase in positive, 6523.\n\n"}

{"id": "28365380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28365380", "title": "Bicultural identity", "text": "Bicultural identity\n\nBicultural identity is the condition of being oneself regarding the combination of two cultures. The term can also be defined as biculturalism, which is the presence of two different cultures in the same country or region. As a general term, culture involves the behaviors and belief characteristics of a particular social, ethnic, or age group. Within culture, we have cultural effects, which are the shared behaviors and customs we learn from the institutions around us. An example of a cultural effect would be how an individual’s personality is strongly influenced by the biological and social norms he is exposed to. Another cultural effect would be that in some societies it would be more acceptable to dress or act in a certain way.\n\nIn regards to bicultural identity, an individual may face conflict assimilating into both cultures or finding a balance between both. An individual may face challenges assimilating into the whole, collective culture. Similarly, an individual may face difficulty balancing their identity within themselves due to the influence of both of their cultures. Being an individual with identity plurality can be hard mentally and emotionally. The different levels of biculturalism can be defined though the way people are able to simultaneously manage their two selves. The more they alternate between them, the more cognitive complexity they face, since they avoid cultural duality and do not practice handling both cultures at the same time. It is through identity integration that they will be able to solve the problem and alleviate the tolls that come with identity plurality Bicultural identity also may have positive effects on the individual, in terms of the additional knowledge they acquire from belonging to more than one culture. Furthermore, with the growing number of racial minorities in American society, individuals that identify with more than one culture may have more linguistic ability.\n\nCulture affects the personality of an individual because the individual may react in a way that is reflective of the knowledge one acquires from one or more culture(s). Problems may arise when ideals in one culture are not connected to another culture, which may cause generalizations about personality. Personality is shaped by both cultures and thus generalizations should not be made based on one single culture. One’s culture also influences one’s hormonal changes, one’s interaction with violence and one’s family values. For example, Hispanic American culture often requires older children to take care and/or help raise younger siblings, while mainstream American culture interprets parents as the sole caregivers. Another example of this difference would be religious preference and or practice. Cultures other than the American culture may often identify more with certain religions and are often more in tune with their religious beliefs.\n\nOne construct to measure bicultural identity is the Bicultural Identity Integration (BII) construct. It is a relatively new construct and was proposed in 2002 by Benet-Martínez, Leu, Lee & Morris. The BII looks at how the bicultural individual perceives his bicultural identities and whether they are compatible or oppositional. It also seeks to identify the big five aspects of an individual’s personality, including aspects such as sociability, activity and emotionality. The BII seeks to find whether an individual has a cultural distance or conflict within one’s cultures, which in turn helps indicate how biculturally competent we are.\n\nLow BII bicultural individuals have difficulties in incorporating both cultures into a cohesive identity and tend to see both cultures as highly dissimilar. Bicultural individuals with high BII on the other hand, see their identities as complementary and themselves as part of a “third” culture, which integrates elements from both their cultures.\nAccording to Margaret Mead, a cultural anthropologist, individuals respond in a more stable fashion when their cultural contexts are understood. \nResearchers wanted to examine how these differences could relate to other factors and the results are insightful. BII is significantly associated with the psychological and social adjustments of the bicultural. Low BII bicultural individuals are found to have inferior bilingual proficiency, experience more anxiety, depression and are more neurotic and less open than bicultural individuals with high BII.\nMore importantly, low BII bicultural individuals are not chameleon-like. They resist the frame switching and are more likely to respond in ways inconsistent with the cultural cues. In other words, when low BII Chinese-Americans are presented with American cues, unlike high BII bicultural individuals, they would not behave like Americans but instead, more like a Chinese.\nHowever, the identity struggle for bicultural individuals can be made less arduous. It is important to note that like other personality traits, BII is malleable to contextual factors. BII can be increased by asking bicultural individuals to recall positive cross-cultural exchanges or like in another study, make high-level construals. These findings can be useful in for example, helping immigrants to cope with their new environment.\n\nLanguage is an essential aspect of any culture. Individuals are able to maintain key aspects of their culture by maintaining their culture’s language. Language is important because it is an oral form of how people interact with other people within a society. Language reinforces the ties among the people who speak the same language, and thus encourages cultural bonding. Thus, by preserving the language within both of one’s cultures, one can maintain one’s integration within each culture. However, this can result in a difficulty in integrating one’s cultures if each has a distinct, different language as it can prevent outsiders from understanding that particular culture.\n\nThe concept of cultural frame switching (CFS) or double consciousness made popular by W.E.B Du Bois addresses how an individual switches between cultural frames or systems in response to their environment. The presence of culture-specific peers can elicit culture-specific values. CFS can be used to describe the switching of different language use depending on the context. Thus, CFS can be connected to cultural accommodation, which is seen when bilinguals respond to situations with the language that applies best to the situation present. \nIt is evident that language can have an effect on an individual’s thinking process; this is because the language itself primes the individual’s cultural values, attitudes and memory which in turn affects behavior. Thus, language has a powerful effect on the way in which an individual responds to change.\n\nAfrican American culture is also known as black culture in the United States and the identity of African American culture is rooted in the historical experience of the African American people. It is rooted in Africa, and is a blend of sub-Saharan African and Sahelean cultures. Due to aspects of African American culture that were accentuated by the slavery period, African American culture is dynamic. \nWithin the African American culture, race or physical differences led to mass murder, and violence against racial groups. These occurrences may affect an individual’s perception of their African American culture. \nIn America, Black and White differences are the most significant groupings largely because of American history. The US was founded on the principle of “all men are equal” and yet slavery existed. This is what resulted in the American Dilemma. Thus, due to historical reasons, and because they are often stereotyped, African Americans have difficulty assimilating with their culture and American culture.\n\nIndividuals having origins within the Far East, Southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent are referred to as Asian under the U.S. Census Bureau. Asian American complete 4.8% of the U.S. population alone. Asian Americans have had the highest educational attainment level and median household income of any racial demographic in the country and attain the highest median personal income overall, . Thus, Asian American Culture is often depicted as the most similar culture to American Culture. \nAsian Americans often communicate non-verbally and/or indirectly, and often are not as bold or upfront as other cultures in terms of their communication. The Asian American way of life is much more group-oriented or holistic and thus the way in which they interpret the world is systematically different from American Culture in terms of thought process and lifestyle. This may make it difficult for Asian Americans to assimilate easily into American culture.\n\nHispanic and Latino Americans have origins in the countries of Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula consisting of Spain and Portugal. Hispanic Americans are very racially diverse. Hispanics constitute 16.5% of the total United States population. \nHispanic Americans often are very religiously oriented and focus on family values and the importance of intergenerational connections. This may cause difficulty in integration with American culture, as the Hispanic community often emphasizes the importance of helping one’s family and advancing as a family rather than simply individual success, which is more prominent within American Culture. Similarly, Hispanics may have difficulty associating with American Culture because of the language culture, as most Hispanics can speak Spanish. The ability to speak Spanish is valued greatly within Hispanic culture, as it is greatly used during social gatherings and amongst extended family. The Spanish language is a significant part of Hispanic culture, and because of the vast amount of racial differences within Hispanic Americans, the way in which Spanish is spoken within the different racial groups is often different. This makes it not only difficult to assimilate into American culture but to often assimilate with the different races in Hispanic America.\n\nImmigrants particularly find it difficult to assimilate both their cultural contexts. Immigrants need to reconcile both their current host cultures and their culture of origin, which is where they grew up. Immigrants culturally evolve through a process of adaptation and assimilation. Immigrants are usually influenced by more dominant values that they have learned in their native cultures. Immigrants encounter a major upheaval by moving far away from home and sometimes may never find themselves connected to either culture. Immigrants face many stresses, which can raise their risk for substance abuse and other psychological stressors. Developing a bicultural identity is involves blending two cultures together and learning to be competent within their two cultures. Immigrants and children of these individuals may be more at risk for victimization, poverty, and the need for assistance from the government. Immigrant parents for example may struggle to find a balance in their new lives and may be so busy keeping up with the demands that may be less involved in the community and in turn less involved with their child’s education.\n\nWith immigrants, language barriers may also bring hardship in terms of communication with natives of their less dominant culture. Immigrants may not adapt fully because of the language barriers holding them back from even simple conversation. Acculturation is the process in which a bicultural individual or immigrant adopts the social norms of the mainstream society. The cultural gap between immigrant parents and their children may widen due to acculturation because younger generations find it easier to adapt to the new culture. Family relations may be strained due to this issue. Children of immigrant parents may enjoy more mainstream culture, but may also want to stick to their families’ roots in order to please their caregivers. Immigrants and bicultural families do have more positive roles as well. They have strong commitments to family and have a dream for a better life. This in turns gives families a sense of purpose and connection and makes the family unit stronger. Native customs such as holidays and religious affiliations may also support the family unit and promote unity all around.\n\nIndividuals with bicultural identity face issues around stereotype threat. Others may be perceived negatively, or their judgments may in turn alter the way that one behaves in certain situations. For example, with standardized testing, African American students in low-income areas often do worse on a given test due to the expectations for them to do worse. Stereotype threat is so powerful that it may extend on to different areas of life, such as the workplace. It is a multidimensional concept that may affect an individual on many levels. Stereotype threat makes it harder for individuals to integrate successfully with their peers if they feel judged or feel pressures to exceed in certain ways especially if their dual cultural roles may be in conflict with one another. Thiese scenarios are contingent on an individual's success with acculturation strategies.\n\nA bicultural individual's integration into a workplace also depends on the cultural makeup of his or her team. A team can be categorized as culturally homogenous, culturally diverse, or possessing a cultural faultline. A bicultural is more likely to integrate with a team, possessing the skills to form a cultural attachment with homogenous or heterogenous teams by traversing cultural barriers.\n\nCaregivers also face a dilemma with their children who have bicultural identities; they want to instill pride in their children, but also must prepare their children for prejudice without making them feel inferior to other cultural groups. For example, African-American parents must socialize their children in such a manner where they will be prepared to face discrimination in society, but they also must preserve their culture in such a way that makes them feel prideful. This dilemma that parents face makes it harder for individuals to feel comfortable within social groups and may minimize the different cultures that individuals surround themselves with. Some individuals can develop a more multicultural outlook and feel confident being around many kinds of people, whereas others may have an issue with this and may stick to their own cultural group.\n\nAcademics within individuals with bicultural identity may also be aversely affected in terms of stereotype threat. An individual may lose motivation in a scholastic setting due to the negative expectations placed on them. Attitudes may change within academics if a student feels as though he cannot do well due to societal constraints on his particular culture. Although this may discourage some, specific tests have been made in order to integrate culture within standardized testing.\n\nA system created by Jane Mercer, assumes that test results cannot be distanced from the culture and it focuses on comparisons among people within particular culture groups rather than between culture groups. This system has been applied to intelligence and ability examinations in order to combat the concern of disadvantaged minorities doing poorly due to their incapacity to do as well as their counterparts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12066647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12066647", "title": "Computer form factor", "text": "Computer form factor\n\nIn computing, the form factor is the specification of a motherboard – the dimensions, power supply type, location of mounting holes, number of ports on the back panel, etc. Specifically, in the IBM PC compatible industry, standard form factors ensure that parts are interchangeable across competing vendors and generations of technology, while in enterprise computing, form factors ensure that server modules fit into existing rackmount systems. Traditionally, the most significant specification is for that of the motherboard, which generally dictates the overall size of the case. Small form factors have been developed and implemented.\n\nA PC motherboard is the main circuit board within a typical desktop computer, laptop or server. Its main functions are as follows:\nAs new generations of components have been developed, the standards of motherboards have changed too. For example, the introduction of AGP and, more recently, PCI Express have influenced motherboard design. However, the standardized size and layout of motherboards have changed much more slowly and are controlled by their own standards. The list of components required on a motherboard changes far more slowly than the components themselves. For example, north bridge microchips have changed many times since their introduction with many manufacturers bringing out their own versions, but in terms of form factor standards, provisions for north bridges have remained fairly static for many years.\n\nAlthough it is a slower process, form factors do evolve regularly in response to changing demands. IBM's long-standing standard, AT (Advanced Technology), was superseded in 1995 by the current industry standard ATX (Advanced Technology Extended), which still governs the size and design of the motherboard in most modern PCs. The latest update to the ATX standard was released in 2007. A divergent standard by chipset manufacturer VIA called EPIA (also known as ITX, and not to be confused with EPIC) is based upon smaller form factors and its own standards.\n\nDifferences between form factors are most apparent in terms of their intended market sector, and involve variations in size, design compromises and typical features. Most modern computers have very similar requirements, so form factor differences tend to be based upon subsets and supersets of these. For example, a desktop computer may require more sockets for maximum flexibility and many optional connectors and other features on board, whereas a computer to be used in a multimedia system may need to be optimized for heat and size, with additional plug-in cards being less common. The smallest motherboards may sacrifice CPU flexibility in favor of a fixed manufacturer's choice.\n\nATX case compatible:\nPC/104 is an embedded computer standard which defines both a form factor and computer bus. PC/104 is intended for embedded computing environments. Single board computers built to this form factor are often sold by COTS vendors, which benefits users who want a customized rugged system, without months of design and paper work.\n\nThe PC/104 form factor was standardized by the PC/104 Consortium in 1992. An IEEE standard corresponding to PC/104 was drafted as IEEE P996.1, but never ratified.\n\nThe 5.75 × 8.0 in Embedded Board eXpandable (EBX) specification, which was derived from Ampro's proprietary Little Board form-factor, resulted from a collaboration between Ampro and Motorola Computer Group.\n\nAs compared with PC/104 modules, these larger (but still reasonably embeddable) SBCs tend to have everything of a full PC on them, including application oriented interfaces like audio, analog, or digital I/O in many cases. Also it's much easier to fit Pentium CPUs, whereas it's a tight squeeze (or expensive) to do so on a PC/104 SBC. Typically, EBX SBCs contain: the CPU; upgradeable RAM subassemblies (e.g., DIMM); Flash memory for solid state drive; multiple USB, serial, and parallel ports; onboard expansion via a PC/104 module stack; off-board expansion via ISA and/or PCI buses (from the PC/104 connectors); networking interface (typically Ethernet); and video (typically CRT, LCD, and TV).\n\nMini PC is a PC small form factor very close in size to an external CD or DVD drive. Mini PCs have proven popular for use as HTPCs.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54480383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54480383", "title": "De Wild Family", "text": "De Wild Family\n\nThe De Wild family was a Dutch family of art professionals, including conservator-restorers, art dealers, painters, and connoisseurs. Prominent internationally in the late nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, they were especially known for their advances in art restoration.\n\nCarel de Wild was born on August 26, 1870, to Angenita Mertina Visser de Wild of Kessel, Limburg. He began his career in the arts early, studying at the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague from the age of 13. Though he was initially trained in painting, the retirement of the Netherlands's top restorer Willem Anthonij Hopman necessitated a successor, and art historians Abraham Bredius and Hofstede de Groot nominated Carel for this role. Beginning in 1894, he studied restoration in Vienna and later Berlin on a scholarship from the Queen Dowager of the Netherlands. He worked at a studio in the Hague from 1895 until 1911, garnering commissions such as the controversial re-varnishing of twelve Frans Hals group portraits in Haarlem.\n\nAfter working with Goupil & Cie in Paris, Carel received an offer to work as an advisor and restorer with art dealing institution Knoedler & Co, and departed for the United States in 1911. During his time with Knoedler & Co., and subsequently at the independent practice on Fifth Avenue he opened in 1916, he worked closely with American industrialists Henry Clay Frick, Joseph Widener, and J.P. Morgan. He advised Frick on several major art purchases in the 1910s, including Vermeer's Mistress and Maid, Gilbert Stuart's portrait of George Washington, and a Jacob Maris landscape, later restoring Frick's prized Rembrandt self-portrait. Well-known as the first to bring the so-called \"Dutch method\" of wax-resin lining outside the Netherlands, he was called in by a government art appraiser to give his expert opinion on a case of suspected art fraud in 1916. A firm proponent of investigating the physical properties, as much as the stylistic ones, of a given artwork, he came to disagree strongly with certain attributions made by his former mentor Bredius. In 1921, he accepted a position as professor of Fine Art at the University of Pennsylvania, teaching the \"technique and care of paintings.\" There, he was only able to give two lectures before retiring due to ill health, and died on May 12, 1922 at his home in Larchmont, New York.\n\nAfter Carel's departure for the United States in 1911, the Haarlem Committee of Supervision nominated his older brother, Derix, to continue restoring the city's twelve Hals group portraits. Like Carel, he worked at the Mauritshuis, developing a close professional relationship with then-director Wilhelm Martin that led to several collaborative projects, often scientific in nature. For example, in July 1916, in response to a threat of chemical attack, they tested the effects of lye on a series of \"dummy\" paintings in order to discover which brand of fire extinguisher was best suited to saving an artwork. Derix is also thought to have assisted Martin in his publications on conservation and restoration. In his continuation of the Hals project at Haarlem, he brought in the chemist Gosen Van der Sleen to aid in his analysis. This was the first known case in the Netherlands of a chemist advising on a painting restoration project. With Van der Sleen's approval, he continued the restoration as planned, working with his son A.M., nephew C. F. Louis, and brother Carel to re-varnish the paintings. Although he published little himself, save for an article in the Kurt Walter Bachstitz Gallery Bulletin, he remained well-occupied with his restoration business in the Hague until his death on December 4, 1932.\n\nAngenitus Martin de Wild, known as A. M. or Martin, was Derix de Wild's son. He sought to further the chemical approach to restoration promoted by his father and uncle. To this end, he enrolled at the Delft University of Technology, completing a doctorate degree in inorganic chemistry in 1928. His book \"The Scientific Examination of Pictures,\" originally completed as part of his chemistry thesis, was soon published internationally. Taking paint samples from a variety of European masterpieces, he studied the chemical makeup of synthetic pigments used in oil painting over time. After Martin's death, the book was considered a \"landmark\" for its technical analysis of pigmentation. Martin's heavily technical method of art analysis and formal chemical training were a relative novelty. He went on to some renown for his involvement in forgery trials throughout the 1930s and 1940s, including the highly publicized Otto Wacker trial in 1932 and the Han van Meegeren trial in 1946. He lectured at the University of Utrecht from 1938 until 1947. Working privately in his studio in the Hague, Martin published widely until his death in 1969, often collaborating with colleagues from the Delft University of Technology and the International Institute for Conservation.\n\nCarel de Wild's son C. F. Louis trained with his uncle Derix for much of his youth, eventually establishing his own restoration practice. Immigrating to the United States from The Hague after his father's death, he opened an independent conservation studio in New York City in 1929. He worked in conjunction with American museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, and, like his father before him, the Frick Collection. Notable paintings he restored include the Alba Madonna and multiple works by Piero della Francesca. He retired from his conservation practice in 1969, and passed away in 1987 at the age of 86.\n\n"}

The name was very common in this period and six nomarchs bearing it are known, two of whom – the fourth and the fifth respectively – were married to a wife with the same name.<br>\nIf this nomarch was the same of \"Djehutynakht IV\", then he lived at the very end of the 11th Dynasty and was the son of the nomarch Ahanakht I, successor of his brother Ahanakht II, and predecessor of the nomarch Neheri I. Otherwise, if he was the same of \"Djehutynakht V\", then he lived during the late reign of pharaoh Amenemhat I of the 12th Dynasty and was Neheri I's son and successor by his wife Djehutyhotep, and the uncle of his successor Neheri II. In either cases, no children are known for Djehutynakht and his wife. See \"Nomarchs of the Hare nome\" for a complete genealogy.\n\nDjehutynakht's tomb – designated 10A – was rediscovered in the Deir el-Bersha necropolis in Middle Egypt in 1915 by the American Egyptologist George Andrew Reisner who was the leader of the Harvard University – Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition. Almost nothing was left of the outer chapel but the burial chamber, although already raided of the jewelry, still contained several finely painted cedar wooden coffins belonged to Djehutynakht and his wife (above all his outer coffin, commonly called “Bersha coffin”, renowned as “the finest painted coffin Egypt produced and a masterpiece of panel painting”. Along with the coffins, in the tomb were found a head of a mummy (most likely a male one thus possibly belonging to the nomarch) as well as lady Djehutynakht's canopic chest and a great number of funerary furniture such as pottery, canopic jars, several model boats, many models of men and women in different daily life activities, and the famous group composed of a priest and many offering girls, known as “Bersha procession”. In its entirety, these objects forms the largest Middle Kingdom funerary assemblage ever found.<br>\nThe Egyptian government gave the whole content of Tomb 10A to the Museum of Fine Arts. During the naval trip to Boston in 1920, the collection was threatened by a fire on board, but fortunately the damage was very limited. For decades only the “Bersha coffin” and the “Bersha procession” were exhibited at the MFA; in 2009-10 the whole collection was shown in a dedicated exhibition.\n"}

This is the standard configuration expected by the Internet standards supporting many DNS-reliant protocols. David Barr published an opinion in RFC 1912 (Informational) recommending it as best practice for DNS administrators, but there are no formal requirements for it codified within the DNS standard itself.\n\nA FCrDNS verification can create a weak form of authentication that there is a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the network that has been given an IP address. While weak, this authentication is strong enough that it can be used for whitelisting purposes because spammers and phishers cannot usually by-pass this verification when they use zombie computers for email spoofing. That is, the reverse DNS might verify, but it will usually be part of another domain than the claimed domain name.\n\nUsing an ISP's mail server as a relay may solve the reverse DNS problem, because the requirement is the forward and reverse lookup for the sending relay have to match, it does not have to be related to the from-field or sending domain of messages it relays.\n\nOther methods for establishing a relation between an IP address and a domain in email are the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and the MX record.\n\nISPs that will not or cannot configure reverse DNS will generate problems for hosts on their networks, by virtue of being unable to support applications or protocols that require reverse DNS agree with the corresponding A (or AAAA) record. ISPs that cannot or will not provide reverse DNS ultimately will be limiting the ability of their client base to use Internet services they provide effectively and securely.\n\n"}

According to the myth, she was born into an affluent Padamangalam Nair tharavad by name Mangalathu at Kanjiracode in Southern Travancore (now in Tamil Nadu). Being a ravishingly beautiful courtesan she had an intimate relationship with Raman Thampi, son of King Rama Varma and rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma. According to the story, she was murdered by her servant and she turned into a Yakshi, (which is a class of mythical beings in Malayalam folklore, equivalent to the Yaksha class in Hindu Puranas) waylaying men with her beauty and drinking their blood.\n\nChiruthevi was a courtesan who had as her clients the high and the mighty. But she was infatuated with one of her many servants, Kunjuraman. Kunjuraman, a Pondan Nair (palanquin-bearer), was a fair, tall, well-built and handsome young man. She and her brother Govindan used to ride on Kunjuraman's back to nearby places. A predatory sadist, Chiruthevi enjoyed torturing Kunjuraman physically and mentally. She did everything possible to separate him from his wife.\n\nIn course of time, the unmarried Govindan and Kunjuraman became bosom friends. They often shared the same room. Chiruthevi was not quite comfortable with the growing fondness of her brother for her lover. But she did not act.\n\nChiruthevi hatched a plot and liquidated Kunjuraman's wife. Once Govindan was travelling on Kunjuraman's back when the former revealed the details of the plot. Days later, Kunjuraman strangled Chiruthevi to death when they were sharing a bed. Govindan winked at the crime and protected his beloved friend.\nChiruthevi was reborn as a vengeful Yakshi to a couple at Kanjiracode. She grew into a bewitching beauty within moments of her birth. Though she seduced many men and drank their blood, her heart was set on the handsome Kunjuraman. She told him that she was willing to pardon him if he married her. Kunjuraman flatly refused. The Yakshi channelised all her energies in tormenting him. Devastated, Kunjuraman sought the assistance of Mangalathu Govindan, who was a great upasaka of Lord Balarama. Govindan was for a compromise. He said that the Yakshi could have Kunjuraman for a year provided she conformed to three conditions. One, she must agree to be installed at a temple after one year. Two, after many years the temple will be destroyed and she must then seek refuge in (saranagati) Lord Narasimha for attaining moksham. Three, she must pray for Govindan and his relationship with Kunjuraman not only in their current birth but also in their subsequent births. The Yakshi swore upon 'ponnum vilakkum' that she would abide by all the three conditions. Thus the compromise formula worked.\n\nA year later, the Yakshi was installed at a Temple which later came to be owned by Kanjiracottu Valiaveedu. The members of Valiaveedu started worshipping this Yakshi besides their Guardian Deity, Sri Ramanuja Perumal (Lord Krishna accompanied by Sri Rukmini and Lord Balarama). Devotees used to offer Pongala to Yakshi Amma on Pooram in the month of Meenom and on the first Fridays in every Malayalam month except Meenom. The Temple does not exist any more.\n\nAfter taking refuge in Lord Narasimha of Thekkedom, the Yakshi is now believed to be residing in Kallara B of Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple. As Princess Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi observes, \"Disturbing her peace would be a disaster especially if her current quiet temperament reverts to the menacing nature that was once hers.\" The enchanting and ferocious forms of this Yakshi are painted on the south-west part of Sri Padmanabha's shrine.\n\nSundara Lakshmi, an accomplished dancer and consort of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma, was an ardent devotee of Kanjirottu Yakshi Amma.\n\n"}

It is a generalization of Tucker's lemma. It was proved by Ky Fan in 1952.\n\nKFL uses the following concepts.\n\nLet \"T\" be a boundary-antipodally-symmetric triangulation of formula_1 and \"L\" a boundary-odd labeling of \"T\".\n\nIf \"L\" has no complementary edge, then \"L\" has an odd number of \"n\"-dimensional alternating simplexes.\n\nBy definition, an \"n\"-dimensional alternating simplex must have labels with \"n\" + 1 different sizes.\n\nThis means that, if the labeling \"L\" uses only \"n\" different sizes (i.e. formula_10), it cannot have an \"n\"-dimensional alternating simplex.\n\nHence, by KFL, \"L\" must have a complementary edge.\n\nKFL can be proved constructively based on a path-based algorithm. The algorithm it starts at a certain point or edge of the triangulation, then goes from simplex to simplex according to prescribed rules, until it is not possible to proceed any more. It can be proved that the path must end in an alternating simplex.\n\nThe proof is by induction on \"n\".\n\nThe basis is formula_11. In this case, formula_1 is the interval formula_13 and its boundary is the set formula_14. The labeling \"L\" is boundary-odd, so formula_15. Without loss of generality, assume that formula_16 and formula_17. Start at −1 and go right. At some edge \"e\", the labeling must change from negative to positive. Since \"L\" has no complementary edges, \"e\" must have a negative label and a positive label with a different size (e.g. −1 and +2); this means that \"e\" is a 1-dimensional alternating simplex. Moreover, if at any point the labeling changes again from positive to negative, then this change makes a second alternating simplex, and by the same reasoning as before there must be a third alternating simplex later. Hence, the number of alternating simplices is odd.\n\nThe following description illustrates the induction step for formula_18. In this case formula_1 is a disc and its boundary is a circle. The labeling \"L\" is boundary-odd, so in particular formula_8 for some point \"v\" on the boundary. Split the boundary circle to two semi-circles and treat each semi-circle as an interval. By the induction basis, this interval must have an alternating simplex, e.g. an edge with labels (+1,−2). Moreover, the number of such edges on both intervals is odd. Using the boundary criterion, on the boundary we have an odd number of edges where the smaller number is positive and the larger negative, and an odd number of edges where the smaller number is negative and the larger positive. We call the former \"decreasing\", the latter \"increasing\".\n\nThere are two kinds of triangles.\n\n\nBy induction, this proof can be extended to any dimension.\n"}

Lin's dictionary made two lexicographical innovations, neither of which became widely used. Collation is based on his graphical \"Instant Index System\" that assigns numbers to Chinese characters based on 33 basic calligraphic stroke patterns. Romanization of Chinese is by Lin's \"Simplified National Romanization System\", which he developed as a prototype for the Gwoyeu Romatzyh or \"National Romanization\" system adopted by the Chinese government in 1928. Lin's bilingual dictionary continues to be used in the present day, particularly the free online version that the Chinese University of Hong Kong established in 1999.\n\nLin Yutang (1895-1976) was an influential Chinese scholar, linguist, educator, inventor, translator, and author of works in Chinese and English.\n\nLin's \"Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" was his second lexicographical effort. From 1932 to 1937, he compiled a 65-volume monolingual Chinese dictionary that was destroyed by Japanese troops during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937, except for 13 volumes that he had shipped earlier to New York (Durdin 1972: 37).\n\nLin Yutang's \"Instant Index System\" for characters inspired his invention of the Ming Kwai Chinese typewriter in 1946. Users would input a character by pressing two keys based upon the 33 basic stroke formations, which Lin called \"letters of the Chinese Alphabet\" (Sorrel 2009).\n\n\"Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" was the first major Chinese‐English dictionary to be produced by a fully bilingual Chinese instead of by Western missionaries (Durdin 1972: 37). In the history of Chinese lexicography, missionaries dominated the first century of Chinese‐English dictionaries, from Morrison's \"A Dictionary of the Chinese Language\" (1815-1823) to Mathews' \"Chinese-English Dictionary\" (1931, 1943) (Durdin 1972: 37) .\n\nIn the period between Mathews' and Lin's dictionaries, both the Chinese and English vocabularies underwent radical changes in terminology for fields such as popular culture, economics, politics, science, and technology. Lin's dictionary included many neologisms and loanwords not found in Mathews', for example (in pinyin), \"yuánzǐdàn\" 原子彈 \" atomic bomb\", \"hépíng gòngchǔ\" 和平共處 \"peaceful coexistence\", \"xị̌nǎo\" 洗腦 \"brainwash\", \"tàikōngrén\" 太空人 \"astronaut\", \"yáogǔn\" 搖滾 \"rock 'n' roll\", and \"xīpí\" 嬉皮 \"hippie\".\n\nThe history of \"Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" began in late 1965, when Lin and Li Choh-ming, the founding Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, made plans for compiling a new Chinese-English dictionary as a \"lasting contribution to knowledge\" (1972: xvi). When the dictionary was published, Lin acknowledged that Li's \"vision and enthusiastic support\" made the compilation project possible. Lin started working on the dictionary in Taipei, and in the spring of 1967, he accepted the position of Research Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Qian 2011: 251). After completing the manuscript in the spring of 1971, Lin moved to Hong Kong, where his former student Francis Pan and a team of young Chinese University graduates assisted him with copyediting, research, and final preparations (Durdin 1972: 37).\n\nLi Choh-ming also contributed the dictionary's foreword (in Chinese and English) and title Chinese calligraphy seen on the cover. Li says that a good Chinese-English dictionary should provide an \"idiomatic equivalence\" of terms in the two languages, and derides previous dictionaries for rendering \"fèitiě\" 廢鐵 as \"old iron\" when it should \"obviously\" be \"scrap iron\" (1972: xvi). However, \"old iron\" is perfectly good British English usage (Pollard 1973: 786).\n\nThis first edition was bilingually titled Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage or Dāngdài Hàn-Yīng cídiǎn (當代漢英詞典). Sponsored by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, this book was printed in Japan by Kenkyūsha, which is known for publishing high-quality dictionaries, and was distributed by McGraw-Hill in the United States. The original edition included three indexes: Lin's idiosyncratic \"instant\" index for looking up traditional Chinese characters, an alphabetical English index, and an index of about 2,000 simplified Chinese characters. However, many users unfamiliar with Lin's character indexing system found the dictionary difficult to use, which led to the following supplement.\n\nIn 1978, The Chinese University Press published the Supplementary index to Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage or Lín Yǔtáng dāngdài Hàn-Yīng cídiǎn zēng biān suǒyǐn (林語堂當代漢英詞典增編索引), which indexed by Wade-Giles romanization and by the 214 Kangxi radicals.\n\nThe 1987 revised edition The New Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary or Zuìxīn Lín Yǔtáng dāngdài Hàn-Yīng cídiǎn (最新林語堂當代漢英詞典), which was edited by Lai Ming (黎明) and Lin Tai-yi, Lin Yutang's son-in-law and daughter, has about 6,300 character head entries and 60,000 compounds or phrases, said to be \"what general readers are likely to encounter or likely to use in their daily lives and studies\" (1987: xii). Compared with the 1720-page original edition, the 1077-page new edition has approximately 1,700 fewer head entries and 40,000 more phrases. The revised edition has five indexes: numerical Instant Index System, simplified \"Guoryuu Romatzyh\", Wade-Giles, Mandarin Phonetic Symbols, and 214 radicals.\n\nA team of scholars at the Chinese University of Hong Kong Research Centre for Humanities Computing developed a free web edition of \"Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" and published it online in 1999. The web edition comprises a total of 8,169 head characters, 40,379 entries of Chinese words or phrases, and 44,407 explanatory entries of grammatical usage. Chinese character encoding is in the Big5 system (which includes 13,053 traditional Chinese characters), which does not encode simplified Chinese characters or uncommon characters (represented as \"□\" in the dictionary) included in Unicode's 80,388 CJK Unified Ideographs. The web edition dictionary replaces Lin Yutang's obsolete Gwoyeu Romatzyh system with modern standard pinyin romanization, which users can hear pronounced through speech synthesis. It also abandons Lin's obsolete Instant Index System, which \"has not been widely used since its inception\", and provides three machine-generated indexes by radical, pinyin, and English.\n\nLin's \"Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" comprises approximately 8,100 character head entries and 110,000 word and phrase entries (Dunn 1977: 81). It includes both modern Chinese neologisms such as \"xǐnǎo\" 洗腦 \"brainwash\" and many Chinese loanwords from English such as \"yáogǔn\" 搖滾 \"rock 'n' roll\" and \"xīpí\" 嬉皮 \"hippie\". The lexicographical scope \"includes all words and phrases that a modern reader is likely to encounter with(sic) in reading modern newspapers, magazines and books\" (Lin 1972: xix). The dictionary contains an English index of over 60,000 words, which effectively serves as an English-Chinese dictionary. It also includes a table with 2,000 simplified Chinese characters that had come into common use in the People’s Republic of China during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nLin Yutang's dictionary introduced two new Chinese linguistic systems that he invented, the Instant Index System for looking up characters and Simplified Guoryuu Romatzyh for romanizing pronunciations. Lin claimed a third innovation of being the first dictionary to determine parts of speech for Chinese words, but that distinction goes to the War Department's 1945 Dictionary of Spoken Chinese (1972: xxiii; Dunn 1977: 81).\n\nCollation in \"Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" is by means of Lin's numerical Instant Index System for characters, which he describes as \"the culmination of five decades of research\". Lin previously developed this system for selecting characters with his 1946 Ming Kwai Chinese typewriter (above). The system's Chinese name \"shàngxiàxíng jiǎnzìfǎ\" 上下形檢字法 meaning \"character lookup method by upper and lower shape\" describes how each character is assigned a four-digit (or optional five-digit) code number according to the stroke patterns in their top left and bottom right corners. In analogy to the more popular Four-Corner Method that assigns a character a four-digit code based upon graphic strokes in the four corners, plus an optional fifth digit, Lin's simpler Instant Index System is sometimes called the \"Two-Corner Method\" (Theobald 2000).\n\nFirst, Lin breaks down all Chinese characters into 33 basic stroke formations, called the \"letters of the Chinese Alphabet\", arranged into ten groups suggested by the characters for numerals. For instance, the character for \"liu\" 六 \"6\" is the mnemonic basic for \"letters\" 亠 (60), 广 (61), 宀 (62), and 丶 (63). Second, Lin lists the \"fifty radicals\" (common among the traditional 214 Kangxi radicals) designated with letters A through D, as in 氵 (63A), 礻 (63B), 衤 (63C), and 戸 (63D). Third, characters that can be divided vertically into left and right components are called \"split\" (S), and those characters that cannot are called \"non-split\" (NS), thus 羊 and 義 are (NS) while 祥 and 佯 are (S).\n\nLin's primary rule for the Instant Index is \"Geometric Determination: The tops are defined as the \"geometrically highest\"; the bottoms are \"geometrically lowest\". They are not the first and last strokes in writing.\" For example, the four-digit lookup code for 言 is 60.40 since the highest upper left stroke is 亠 (60) and the lowest bottom right stroke is 口 (40). Lin's dictionary lists only three characters 言, 吝, and 啻 in the 60.40 group, but there is a further rule for code groups that list many, such as 81A.40 with ten characters like 鈷 (81A.40-1) and 銘 (81A.40-9), \"The Fifth Digit: Top of Remainder\" arranges the group's character entries in numerical accordance with the \"top of remainder\" (character minus \"radical\").\n\nRomanization in \"Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" is by \"Simplified \"Guoryuu Romatzyh\"\" (\"Jiǎnhuà luómǎzì\" 簡化羅馬字, \"Jiaanhuah Rormaatzyh\" in Lin's system) that he developed in 1923 and 1924 as a prototype for the \"Gwoyeu Romatzyh\" (GR) \"National Language Romanization\" system adopted by the Chinese Government in 1928 (Dunn 1977: 81). Lin also calls this system \"Simplified Romatzyh\" and \"Basic GR\".\n\nBoth systems represent the four tones of Standard Chinese with different spellings but Lin's simplified GR is more consistent than standard GR. For instance, the word \"Guóyǔ\" 國語 (\"National Language; Standard Chinese; Mandarin\") is romanized \"Gwoyeu\" in official GR and \"Guoryuu\" in Lin's simplified GR, which exemplifies the difference between systems. Pinyin 2nd-tone \"guó\" (國) is GR \"gwo\" and \"basic\" GR \"guor\"; and 3rd-tone \"yǔ\" (語) is \"yeu\" and \"yuu\", respectively. Simplified GR consistently represents tone by the spelling of the main vowel in a syllable, with vowel unchanged for 1st-tone (\"guo\"), \"-r\" added for 2nd-tone \"guor\" (國), vowel doubled for 3rd-tone (\"guoo\"), and \"-h\" added for 4th-tone (\"guoh\"); and similarly \"yu\", \"yur\", \"yuu\" (語), and \"yuh\". Standard GR uses these same four tonal spellings for many syllables (tones 1-4 are \"a\", \"ar\", \"aa\", and \"ah\"), but changes them for some others, including \"guo\", \"gwo\" (國), \"guoo\", and \"guoh\"; and \"yiu\", \"yu\", \"yeu\" (語), \"yuh\".\n\nLin Yutang said, \"People who are new to this system will doubtless be disturbed by it at first. But they'll get used to it very quickly. I don't need to emphasize the point that the method of building the tone into the spelling of the word fits the modern world of telegraphy, the typewriter and the computer.\" (Durdin 1972: 37).\n\nEntries in \"Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" are lexicographically sophisticated and have accurate translation equivalents. The basic format for a head entry gives the character, the Instant Index System code, the pronunciation(s) in Simplified GR, the part or parts of speech, optionally other speech levels (e.g., \"sl.\" for slang), English translation equivalents for the head character and usage examples of polysyllabic compounds, phrases, and idioms, subdivided by numbers for multiple meanings, and lastly a list of common Chinese words using the entry character, each given with characters, pronunciation, part of speech, and translation equivalents (Ching 1975: 524). The dictionary distinguishes historical varieties: \"AC\" (Ancient Chinese), \"MC\" (Middle Chinese), \"LL\" (Literary Language), and \"Dial.\" (dialect); and levels of speech: \"court.\" (courteous), \"sl.\" (slang), \"satir.\" (satirical,) \"facet.\" (facetious), \"contempt.\" (contemptuous), \"abuse\", \"derog.\" (derogatory), \"vulgar\", and \"litr.\" (literary) (Lin 1972: xx-xxi).\n\nLin explains that the basic principle for translation equivalents is \"contextual semantics, the subtle, imperceptible changes of meaning due to context\" (1972: xxiv). In terms of the translational contrast between dynamic and formal equivalence, Lin placed emphasis on presenting the dynamic or \"idiomatic equivalence\" of words and phrases rather than rendering formal literal translations (Dunn 1977: 81).\n\nThe Chinese character 道 for \"dào\" \"way; path; say; the Dao\" or \"dǎo\" \"guide; lead; instruct\" (or 導) provides a good sample entry for a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and is polysemous.\nThe first \"N. adjunct.\" and third \"V.i.\" part-of-speech sections refer to grammatical \"noun adjunct\" or Chinese measure word and \"intransitive verb\".\n\nReviewers of \"Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" have praised some aspects like the translation equivalents and censured others like the \"instant\" character indexing system. On the one hand, \"New York Times\" reporter Peggy Durdin calls the dictionary a \"milestone in communication between the world's two largest linguistic groups, the Chinese‐speaking and English‐speaking peoples\" (1972: 37). On the other, the American sinologist and historian Nathan Sivin says, \"Despite a good deal of meretricious ballyhoo when it was published, Lin's book does not contain significant lexicographic innovations.\" (1976: 308).\n\nReviews are mentioned by English sinologist and translator David E. Pollard, \"Lin Yutang is his own worst enemy: one can visualize the hackles of reviewers everywhere rising both at his claims, which are mostly phony, and his denials, which are often untrue.\" (1973: 786). After criticizing faults in Lin Yutang's dictionary, one reviewer gave a balanced conclusion, \"the mistakes and omissions are far outweighed by his index system even with its kinks, and by his typable, indexable, computerizable romanization system, his generally excellent English translations, and his comprehensive and up-to-date entries.\" (Ching 1975: 524).\n\nLin Yutang's confusing Instant Index System has been widely criticized. Nathan Sivin surveyed users of the numerical system and found that most \"consider it a nuisance to use\" (1976: 309). What Lin called an \"unforgettable instant index system\", proved to be \"an unnecessary and not easily remembered variation on the traditional four-corner arrangement\" (Chan and Pollard 2001: 1100). Since most students of Chinese who purchase Lin's dictionary already know the conventional 214 radical-stroke and Four-Corner systems, they \"may resent having to learn a new set of tricks\", says Pollard, who suggests that \"the process of compiling a Chinese dictionary will always bring out the mad inventor in people\" (1973: 788). Ching says Lin's system is a \"praiseworthy improvement\" over previous Chinese-English dictionaries, but it is not as easy to use as an alphabetically arranged dictionary. Although the name Instant Index System \"promises facility and speed in locating characters\", it is often \"difficult to locate them \"instantly\",\" for two major reasons: the variability of Chinese characters and cases when dictionary users interpret the rule of geometric determination differently from what Lin intended. For example, according to the rule, it would be \"most logical\" to search for this character \"chin\" 緊 under number 30, the horizontal stroke 一 at the top left, but it is classified under number 51, the cliff radical 厂, and no cross-references are provided (1975: 522).\n\nLin's \"Simplified Romatzyh\" system of romanization also has detractors. While one reviewer called the romanization system \"revolutionary even though it has been in existence for quite some time\", and agreed with Lin that \"as a learning tool, the \"basic\" GR is better\" (Ching 1975: 522), others have been less impressed. \"Casual users unwilling to master the complexities of its arrangement and transcription will find it practically inaccessible\" (Sivin 1976: 309). The system \"still remains daunting unless the reader finds compelling reasons\" to use Lin's dictionary (Chan and Pollard 2001: 1100).\n\nMany reviewers have commented on the wide range of entries in Lin's dictionary, which is aimed not at students of a special field, but at \"modern, educated man\" (Durdin 1972: 37). Lin Yutang's introduction says many dictionary entries come from Wang Yi's (1937-1945) \"Gwoyeu Tsyrdean\" 國語辭典 \"Dictionary of the National Language\". Sivin calls Lin's dictionary \"largely an English translation of the excellent\" \"Gwoyeu Tsyrdean\" (1976: 308). Pollard criticizes Lin's list of Chinese terms that had \"never been carefully noted\" prior to his dictionary, since all that he did was to translate the half that are \"carefully noted\" in the Wang's dictionary, while \"Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary\" (1931, 1943) also includes half of the terms. \"To have gutted the \"Gwoyeu Tsyrdean\" would by itself have been a worthwhile job, but he has done more, by selectively expanding and explaining and, particularly, by adding a host of new terms and expressions\" (1973: 786-787).\n\nEugene Ching says that Lin Yutang's choice of modernized entries \"makes his dictionary the most up-to-date available today\" (1975: 522). Ching analyzed the 120 entries under \"chu\" 出 \"go out; come out\" in Lin Yutang's \"Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" with the 170 in Wang's \"Gwoyeu Tsyrdean\" and found that Lin added and eliminated certain types of lexical items. In the process of addition, Lin not only incorporated new lexical items (e.g., \"taanbair\" 坦白 \"confess one's own guilt in communist meeting\"), but also included new meanings for old items (\"a girl secretary in office kept for her looks rather than work\" for \"huapirng\" 花瓶(兒) \"flower vase\"). Eliminated items include: obsolete or rare terms (\"chudueihtzy\" 出隊子 \"a poetic pattern\"), expressions whose meanings can be synthesized (\"chubaan faa\" 出版法 \"publication codes\"), and highly literary expressions (\"chu-choou-yarng-jir\" 出醜揚疾 \"to expose the ugliness and defects\"). However, this process of elimination gave rise to mistakes, such as omitting some common literary clichés (\"chu-erl-faan-er\" 出爾反爾 \"outstanding\") and overlooking frequently used meanings (\"to complete the apprenticeship\" for \"chu-shyw\" 出師 \"to march army for battle\").\n\nLin Yutang's \"Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage\" has been repeatedly criticized for not including more vocabulary developed in the PRC. Lin's dictionary \"covers essential Chinese as spoken and written today outside the People's Republic and ignores terminology peculiar to mainland China\" (Sivin 1976: 309). Dunn estimates that only about 1% of the total number of entries are \"Chinese Communist words and phrases\", such as \"xiàfàng\" 下放 \"send down urban cadres to work at a lower level or do manual labor in the countryside\" and \"Dà yuè jìn\" 大跃进 \"Great Leap Forward\" (1977: 81). Although Lin's dictionary includes words from many modern sources, \"What is left out, unfortunately for most potential users, is the vocabulary developed in the People's Republic\" (Pollard 1973: 787).\n\nReviewers have frequently commended Lin's dictionary for its accurate English translation equivalents of each head character and its multiple usage examples. Sivin says that \"in accuracy of translation, clarity of explanation, and colloquialism of English equivalents this is greatly superior to any other dictionary in a Western European language\" 1976: 309). \"Lin Yutang's business is in words, and he knows how they are manipulated; he also has a very wide knowledge of things Chinese, which helps him immeasurably in his task. Of course there are instances where better English equivalents could have been found, and his scholarship is not infallible, but it probably is true, as Professor Li claims, that he is uniquely qualified, among individuals, to bridge the gap between the two languages.\" (Pollard 1973: 787).\n\nSeveral scholars have found faults with the dictionary's treatment of parts-of-speech and syntactic categories. Lin's main claim \"to have solved at one stroke the problem of Chinese grammar by classifying words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions, would need some justifying, since it is ultimately based on the premise that Chinese is the same as Latin\", and a scheme that is only a \"pis-aller should not be presented as a revelation\" (Pollard 1973: 787). Ching says the best way grammar can be taught in a dictionary is through sample phrases or sentences, but without appropriate examples, the \"students depending upon this dictionary for self-study will find the grammatical labels alone not really useful\" (1975: 524). Sivin describes Lin's grouping of words by English parts of speech as \"linguistically retrograde and confusing, since the structure of Chinese is quite different\" (1976: 308). Lin explained that, \"most linguists have doubted whether Chinese has anything that could be called grammar. Well, one certainly cannot discover grammar until one recognizes and thinks in terms of whole words, which are parts of speech—nouns, verbs and so on. Then one sees that Chinese grammar exists.\" (Durdin 1972: 37).\n\nLastly, Lin Yutang's dictionary has some minor mistakes (Ching 1975: 524). One example of translation error is found under the very first entry, \"tsair\" 才; \"tsairmauh\" 才貌 \"personal appearance as reflecting ability\" is translationally incompatible with \"larng-tsair-nyuumauh\" 郎才女貌 \"the boy has talent and the girl has looks\" (under 郎) and \"tsair-mauh-shuang-chyuarn\" 才貌雙全 \"to have both talent and looks\" (under 全). Another example of carelessness is seen under the sequential entries \"shyu\" 戍 \"Garrison; frontier guard\" and \"shuh\" 戌 \"No. 11 in the duodecimal cycle\", where Lin warns students to distinguish the characters from each other. Yet, the \"chiaan\" 遣 entry writes the example word \"chiaanshuh\" 遣戌 \"send to exile\" twice as \"遣戍\"; an error that the revised 1987 edition corrected. Admittedly, these two ideographic characters are easily confused, \"xū\" 戌 (戊 \"a weapon\" and a horizontal stroke 一 signifying \"to wound\") \"destroy; 11th\" and \"shù\" 戍 (戊 \"a weapon\" and a dot 丶 simplified from the original 人 \"person\" signifying \"person with a weapon\") \"frontier guard\" (Bernard Karlgren, Wenlin 2016). Eugene Ching concludes that, \"Since his profound knowledge of both Chinese and English makes Lin one of the most qualified persons to work on a bilingual dictionary, it is impossible that he is ignorant of the correct translation and the correct grammar of the above examples. These mistakes can only suggest Lin's failure to proofread carefully the work of his assistants.\"\n\n"}

A list of those used in Roman Republican and early Imperial times may be seen in James Chidester Egbert, Jr.'s \"Latin Inscriptions\" (New York City, 1896), 417–459.\n\nThe Jewish scribes and Talmudic scholars also had frequent recourse to abbreviations. Between the seventh and ninth centuries the ancient Roman system of abbreviations gave way to a more difficult one that gradually grew up in the monastic houses and in the chanceries of the new Teutonic kingdoms. Merovingian, Lombard, and Anglo-Saxon scripts offer each their own abbreviations, not to speak of the unique scotica manus or libri scottice scripti (Irish hand, or books written in the medieval Irish hand). Eventually such productive centres of technical manuscripts as the Papal Chancery, the theological schools of Paris and Oxford, and the civil-law school of Bologna set the standards of abbreviations for all Europe.\n\nMedieval manuscripts abound in abbreviations, owing in part to the abandonment of the uncial, or quasi-uncial, and the almost universal use of the cursive, hand. The medieval writer inherited a few from Christian antiquity; others he invented or adapted, in order to save time and parchment. They are found especially in manuscripts of scholastic theology and canon law, annals and chronicles, the Roman law, and in administrative documents, civil and privileges, bulls, rescripts. They multiplied with time, and were never so numerous as on the eve of the discovery of printing; many of the early printed books offer this peculiarity, together with other characteristics of the manuscript page.\n\nThe development of printing brought about the abandonment of many abbreviations, while it suggested and introduced new ones a process also favoured by the growth of ecclesiastical legislation, the creation of new offices, etc. There was less medieval abbreviation in the text of books much used on public occasions, e.g. missals, antiphonaries, Bibles; in one way or another the needs of students seem to have been the chief cause of the majority of medieval abbreviations. The means of abbreviation were usually full points or dots (mostly in Roman antiquity), the semicolon (eventually conventionalized), lines (horizontal, perpendicular, oblong, wavy curves, and commas). Vowel-sounds were frequently written not after, but over, the consonants. Certain letters, like p and q, that occur with extreme. frequency, e.g. in prepositions and terminations, became the source of many peculiar abbreviations; similarly, frequently recurring words like et (and), est (is). Habit and convenience are today the principal motives for using abbreviations. Most of those in actual use fall under one or other of the following heads: Administrative, Liturgical, Scholastic, and Chronological.\n\nThe first class of abbreviations includes those used in the composition of Pontifical documents. They were once very numerous, and lists of them may be seen in the works quoted below (e.g. Quantin, Prou). It may be well to state at once that since 29 December 1878, by order of Leo XIII, the great papal documents (Litterae Apostolicae) are no longer written in the old Gothic hand known as bollatico; all abbreviations, with the exception of a few obvious ones, like S.R.E., were abolished by the same authority (Acta Sanctae Sedis, XI, 465–467). In the transaction of ordinary business the Roman Congregations are wont to use certain brief and pithy formulas (e.g. Negative = \"No\"; Negative et amplius = \"No with emphasis\"). They are not, correctly speaking, abbreviations. For a list of these see Canon law. This class includes also the abbreviations for the names of most sees. The full Latin titles of all existing (Latin) dioceses may be seen in the Roman annual, \"Gerarchia Cattolica\", a complete list of the Latin names of all known dioceses (extant or extinct) is found in the large folio work of the Comte de Mas Latrie, \"Trésor de chronologie, d'histoire et de géographie\" (Paris, 1884). For the same purpose the reader may also consult the episcopal catalogues of the Benedictine Pius Bonifacius Gams, \"Series Episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae\" (Ratisbon, 1873–86), and the Franciscan Conrad Eubel, \"Hierarchia Catholica Medii Ævi\" (Münster, 1898–1902). Under this general heading may be included all abbreviated forms of addresses in ordinary intercourse, whether of individuals or of members of religious orders, congregations, institutes, to which may be added the forms of addresses usual for members of Catholic lay societies and the Papal orders of merit. (See Catholic societies, orders of merit.) The abbreviations of the titles of Roman Congregations, and of the individual canonical ecclesiastical authorities, belong also to this class.\n\nA second class of abbreviations includes those used in the description of liturgical acts or the directions for their performance, e.g. the Holy Mass, the Divine Office (Breviary), the ecclesiastical devotions, etc. Here may also be classed the abbreviated forms for the name of God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost; also for the names of the Blessed Virgin, the saints, etc.; likewise abbreviations used in the administration of the Sacraments, mortuary epitaphs, etc. (to which class belong the numerous Catacomb inscriptions); finally some miscellaneous abbreviations like those used in the publication of documents concerning beatification and canonization.\n\nIn the third class belong scholastic abbreviations, used to designate honorific titles acquired in the schools, to avoid the repetition of lengthy titles of books and reviews, or to facilitate reference to ecclesiastical and civil legislation.\n\nIn the fourth class of abbreviations belong all such as are used to describe the elements of the year, civil or ecclesiastical.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32589663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32589663", "title": "Paternalistic conservatism", "text": "Paternalistic conservatism\n\nPaternalistic conservatism is a strand in conservatism which reflects the belief that societies exist and develop organically and that members within them have obligations towards each other. There is particular emphasis on the paternalistic obligation of those who are privileged and wealthy to the poorer parts of society. Since it is consistent with principles such as organicism, hierarchy and duty, it can be seen an outgrowth of traditional conservatism. Paternal conservatives support neither the individual nor the state in principle, but are instead prepared to support either or recommend a balance between the two depending on what is most practical.\n\nOne-nation conservatism was first conceived by the Conservative British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who presented his political philosophy in two novels, \"Sybil, Or The Two Nations\" and \"Coningsby\", published in 1845 and 1844 respectively. Disraeli's conservatism proposed a paternalistic society with the social classes intact, but with the working class receiving support from the Establishment. He emphasised the importance of social obligation rather than the individualism that pervaded his society. Disraeli warned that Britain would become divided into two nations (of the rich and poor) as a result of increased industrialisation and inequality. Concerned at this division, he supported measures to improve the lives of the people to provide social support and protect the working classes.\n\nDisraeli justified his ideas by his belief in an organic society in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another. He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of \"noblesse oblige\", which asserted that the aristocracy had an obligation to be generous and honourable and to Disraeli this implied that government should be paternalistic. Unlike the New Right, one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies as one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of social stability. Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that should the ruling class become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and social revolution would become a possibility.\n\nIn Europe, Catholic political movements emerged in the 19th century as a response to widespread deterioration of social conditions and rising anti-clerical and democratic tendencies amongst artisans and workers. It mixed social commitment, paternalistic social welfare and authoritarian patronage from above with deepening popular piety. In France, the influence of these doctrines can be seen in the conservative socialism of Albert de Mun and René de La Tour du Pin. The German conservative Lutheran figure Adolf Stoecker founded the Christian Social Workers' Party in 1878 that aimed to align workers with Protestant Christianity and the German monarchy. Stoecker respected existing social hierarchies, but he also desired a state that would be active in protecting the poor and vulnerable citizens. Stoecker on occasion used antisemitic rhetoric to gain support, though he urged supporters to practice Christian love even towards Jews.\n\n19th-century German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck adopted policies of state-organized compulsory insurance for workers against sickness, accident, incapacity and old age in what has been nicknamed \"Bismarckian socialism\", better known as \"State Socialism\". The term was actually coined by Bismarck's liberal opposition, but later accepted by Bismarck. Bismarck himself was not a socialist and enacted the Anti-Socialist Laws, rather his actions were designed to offset the growth of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Bismarck's policies have been viewed as a form of state socialism. However, Bismark's State Socialism was based upon Romantic political thought in which the state was supreme and carried out Bismarck's agenda of supporting \"the protest of collectivism against individualism\" and of \"nationality against cosmopolitanism\" and stated that \"the duty of the State is to maintain and promote the interests, the well-being of the nation as such\".\n\nThe academic equivalent of Bismarck's State Socialism at the time was the \"Kathedersozialismus\" of Adolph Wagner and Gustav Schmoller. Schmoller was an opponent of both liberalism and Marxian proletarian socialism. Wagner had originally been a Manchester liberal, but he had developed into a far-right conservative and antisemite. \"Kathedersozialists\" held in common three tenets, namely that \"economic freedom cannot be absolute\", \"the economy must obey ethical as well as practical demands\" and \"the state must intervene to provide a degree of social justice\". Schmoller denied that free trade and \"laissez-faire\" economics were suitable for Germany, instead advocating state intervention in the economy to foster industrialism and improving conditions for labourers. Schmoller endorsed the Prussian monarchy as historically being a \"benevolent and socially mediating institution\". Schmoller stated: \"A firm monarchy is a great blessing when it is bound up with traditions like those of the Prussian monarchy, which recognizes its duties\".\n\nA Red Tory is an adherent of a political philosophy derived from the Tory tradition, predominantly in Canada, but also in the United Kingdom. This philosophy tends to favour communitarian social policies, while maintaining a degree of fiscal discipline and a respect of social and political order. In Canada, Red Toryism is found in provincial and federal Conservative political parties. The history of Red Toryism marks differences in the development of the political cultures of Canada and the . Canadian conservatism and American conservatism have been different from each other in fundamental ways, including their stances on social issues and the role of government in society.\n\nThe adjective \"red\" refers to the economically left-leaning nature of Red Toryism in comparison with Blue Toryism, since socialist and other leftist parties have traditionally used the colour red. In Canada today, however, red is commonly associated with the centre-left Liberal Party. The term reflects the broad ideological range traditionally found within conservatism in Canada.\n\nThe term right-wing socialism is a term used by some free-market right-libertarian movements and politicians to describe paternalistic conservatism as they see it supporting paternalism and social solidarity as opposed to individualism, commercialism and \"laissez-faire\" economics. They argue that paternalist conservatism supports state promoted social hierarchy and allows certain people and groups to hold higher status in such a hierarchy, which is conservative. The term is also used—more commonly, but distinctly—to refer to moderate social democratic forms of socialism when contrasted with Marxism–Leninism and other more radical left-wing alternatives. In \"The Communist Manifesto\", Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels criticised the \"Philosophy of Poverty\" by the anarchist writer and theorist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as representing conservative or bourgeois socialism. Military socialism, guild socialism, agrarian socialism and some forms of Christian socialism are also termed right-wing socialism by various authors.\n\nThe term conservative socialism was used as a rebuke by Karl Marx for certain strains of socialism, but it has also been used by proponents of such a system.\n\nAn early proponent of self-described conservative socialism was 19th-century Austrian politician Klemens von Metternich as early as 1847. Monarchists had begun to use socialist as an antithesis of \"bourgeois \"laissez-faire\"\" indicating reliance on a social conscience as opposed to pure individualism. Metternich said the aims of such a conservative socialism were \"peaceful, class-harmonizing, cosmopolitan, traditional\". Monarchic socialism promoted social paternalism portraying the monarch as having a fatherly duty to protect his people from the effects of free economic forces. Metternich's conservative socialism saw liberalism and nationalism as forms of middle-class dictatorship over the masses.\n\nJohann Karl Rodbertus, a monarchist conservative landowner and lawyer who briefly served as minister of education in Prussia in 1848, promoted a form of state socialism led by an enlightened monarchy supporting state regulation of the economy. Rodbertus supported the elimination of private ownership of land, with the state in control of national capital rather than redistribution of private capital. In the 1880s, Rodbertus' conservative socialism was promoted as a non-revolutionary alternative to social democracy and a means to justify the acceptance of Bismarck's social policies.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n"}

Paul, the plaintiff, against the defendants, former President Bill Clinton, and his wife, former First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Clintons were accused of alleged swindling of Paul's money and interference in his business dealings on June 19, 2001 in Los Angeles. James Levin, a Democratic Party fundraiser close to the Mr. Clinton and a Chicago business man, as well as two producers of the star-studded fundraiser, Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton, Aaron Tonken, a protege of Paul, and Gary Smith, were also named defendants in the suit. Paul alleged that he spent more than $1.9 million of his own personal funds to organize and sponsor the event held on August 12, 2000. The fundraiser was held on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, during Hillary Clinton's first Senate race. The fundraiser attracted many stars, such as Cher, Brad Pitt, John Travolta, Diana Ross, Muhammad Ali and many others. He claimed that the reason he financed the fundraiser and other events for Hillary Clinton was that her husband allegedly agreed to join the board of the company Paul co-founded with Stan Lee, Stan Lee Media, after he left the Oval Office in January 2001. However, Paul said that these promises were never fulfilled. Although he contended the event cost close to $2 million, the campaign reports filed with the Federal Election Commission at the time estimated at about $500,000.\n\nPeter Paul helped organize the Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton fundraiser for the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's 2000 New York Senate campaign, which raised more than $1 million for her campaign. In addition to Paul's promise to help with her campaign, court filings state that in return for working for one year at Stan Lee Media, he offered Mr. Clinton $10 million in SLM stock, $5 million in cash and $1 million for the Clinton Library.Two days after the dinner and concert, a columnist at the Washington Post, Lloyd Grove, reported about Paul's felony record, revealing that he had three separate criminal convictions on fraud and drug charges from the 1970s and 1980s at the time. In the late 1970s, Paul was convicted of cocaine possession with intentions to distribute and of attempting to defraud Fidel Castro's Cuban Government of $8.75 million by selling it a non-existent shipload of coffee beans. Paul was sentenced to approximately 40 months in prison. In the 1980s, he violated his terms of parole by lying to a Customs officer, which resulted in him serving time again. When Paul was arrested for all of these crimes, he claimed that he was part of a secret government operation. Since Howard Wolfson, Hillary Clinton's spokesperson, said that her campaign would not accept any contributions from Paul, they returned the $2000 check they directly received from him and his wife, but ignored Paul's alleged $1.9 million contribution.\n\nFollowing the collapse and declaration of bankruptcy of Stan Lee Media in early February 2001, Paul departed for Brazil to avoid prosecution of stock fraud charges, more specifically he manipulated the price of the Stan Lee Media's stock price. He was indicted with criminal charges and spent more than two years in a Brazilian prison, before being extradited back to the United States.\n\nIn late 2005, one of Hillary Clinton's fundraising committees agreed to pay a $35,000 fine for underreporting gifts spent on the Hollywood gala by $721,895 to boost her campaign for the Senate. Even though the committee had corrected its filings, Paul continuously said that the campaign was still refusing to acknowledge his alleged near $2 million contribution.\n\nOn April 10, 2006 at the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Judge Aurelio Munoz dismissed Senator Hillary Clinton as the defendant in the Paul v. Clinton lawsuit. Judge Munoz Brough criticized Peter Paul's legal team for \"inundat[ing] this court\" with photos of Paul with the Clintons, President Ronald Reaganand his wife, Nancy, and others, which provided no evidence that the Clintons made any promises to him. The judge stated, \"there is nothing to indicate Hillary Clinton was aware that the promises were not made in good faith.\" She sought out dismissal under a California law aimed at reducing lawsuits and protecting people's First Amendment rights. Before Hillary was dismissed, the attorneys representing Paul, the United States Justice Foundation, asked that they have permission to take her deposition, but Judge Munoz declined. Although Senator Clinton was dismissed from the case, the lawsuit continued with Bill Clinton, James Levin, Aaron Tonken and Gary Smith as defendants, and their trial date was set for March 27, 2007.\n\nLater, Peter Paul then filed an appeal of the decision. Two hearings were held on September 7, 2007, and October 16, 2007, where California's Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion to reinstate Senator Hillary Clinton as the defendant in the lawsuit that claims she, her husband and other associates swindled money from Paul to fund the 2000 fundraising event. The appellate court upheld the lower court's, Los Angeles County Superior Court, decision to remove the New York senator and Democratic presidential candidate, while it also said that Clinton would be able to regain her legal costs. After the ruling, Paul said he would consider a further appeal to the Supreme Court of California. Most, but not all of the causes of action against President Clinton had been dismissed on procedural grounds. Paul’s attorneys, mainly Colette Wilson, pleaded that Clinton violated federal code, which would in turn make her not covered the anti-SLAPP statute. A lawyer of Paul, Lucianne Goldberg, then released a video claiming that Clinton was aware of Paul’s illegal campaign activities. However, the evidence he provided did not make his statement clear at all. It only showed Hillary Clinton thanking the fundraiser organizers, without proving anything on Clinton’s knowledge of Paul’s alleged actions.\n\nIn early March 2005, Paul pleaded guilty to one felony of stock fraud. Four years later on June 25, 2009, Judge Leonard Wexler sentenced him to ten years in prison. This was said to have pretty much been the end to the story, mainly because the Washington Post had then become aware that Peter Paul was a three-time convicted felon, making his appeals less interesting. As of early 2009, Hillary and Bill Clinton have both been dismissed from the case, Paul v. Clinton, as defendants, and she won an award of $130,000 in legal fees against Paul. The civil suit was still on-going against Gary Smith, a producer of the 2000 fundraiser.\n\n"}

QR codes can easily be generated to link directly to any Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), but the QRpedia system adds further functionality. It is owned and operated by a subsidiary of Wikimedia UK (WMUK).\n\nQRpedia was conceived by Roger Bamkin, a Wikipedia volunteer, coded by Terence Eden, and unveiled in April 2011. It is currently in use at museums and other institutions in countries including Australia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Macedonia, Spain, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Ukraine and the United States. The project's source code is freely reusable under the MIT License.\n\nWhen a user scans a QRpedia QR code on their mobile device, the device decodes the QR code into a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) using the domain name \"\"languagecode\".qrwp.org\" and whose path (final part) is the title of a Wikipedia article, and sends a request for the article specified in the URL to the QRpedia web server. It also transmits the language setting of the device.\n\nThe QRpedia server then uses Wikipedia's API to determine whether there is a version of the specified Wikipedia article in the language used by the device, and if so, returns it in a mobile-friendly format. If there is no version of the article available in the preferred language, then the QRpedia server offers a choice of the available languages, or a Google translation.\n\nIn this way, one QRcode can deliver the same article in many languages, even when the museum is unable to make its own translations. QRpedia also records usage statistics.\n\nQRpedia was conceived by Roger Bamkin, a Wikipedia volunteer, and Terence Eden, a mobile web consultant, and was unveiled on 9 April 2011<ref name=\"GLAM/D-1\"></ref> at Derby Museum and Art Gallery's \"Backstage Pass\" event, part of the \"GLAM/Derby\" collaboration between the museum and Wikipedia, during which over 1,200 Wikipedia articles, in several languages, were also created. The project's name is a portmanteau word, combining the initials \"QR\" from \"QR (\"Quick Response\") code\" and \"pedia\" from \"Wikipedia\".\n\nThe project's source code is freely reusable under the MIT License.\n\nThough created in the United Kingdom, QRpedia can be used in any location where the user's phone or tablet has a data signal (or remembers URLs until a signal is available) and is in use at venues including:\n\nQRpedia also has uses outside of such institutions. For example, the Occupy movement uses it on campaign posters.\n\nIn January 2012, QRpedia was one of four projects (from 79 entrants) declared the most innovative mobile companies in the UK of 2011 by the Smart UK Project, and thus chosen to compete at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, on 29 February 2012. The criteria were \"to be effective, easy to understand and with global potential and impact\".\n\nA conflict of interest case involving QRpedia was identified as one of the \"main incidents\" leading to a 2012 review of the governance of Wikimedia UK (WMUK). The review found that the amount of time taken to resolve ownership caused the risk of outsiders perceiving a potential conflict of interest, and that Bamkin's acceptance of consultancy fees on projects (jointly funded by WMUK) involving QRpedia provided an opportunity for damage to the reputation of WMUK. This conflict of interest led to the resignation of WMUK trustee Joscelyn Upendran. Shortly before her resignation on 31 August 2012, Upendran stated that \"the charity has in effect agreed to take on responsibility [...] for a service that is 'co-owned' by a trustee\", and suggested that \"the conflict of interest may present a legal risk under charity and corporate law\". On 9 February 2013, WMUK announced that the intellectual property in QRpedia, and the qrpedia.org and qrwp.org domains, were to be transferred to the chapter at no cost. On 12 February 2013, Michael Peel registered two QRpedia related domain names on behalf of WMUK. On 2 April 2013, WMUK announced that Roger Bamkin and Terence Eden were transferring ownership of QRpedia to Wikimedia UK. On 16 November 2013, WMUK announced that the agreement for the transfer had been signed and the IP rights in QRpedia were held by Cultural Outreach Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of WMUK, and that following the agreement, the transfer of the domain names was an administrative process that could begin immediately.\n\nAt least one Wikimedia chapter has received letters alleging that QRpedia infringes various patents. Though WMUK believes that this is not the case and that the risk of litigation is not high, Cultural Outreach Limited has been set up to hold QRpedia, in order to shield WMUK should such a challenge arise.\n\n\n"}

SLA is a partnership between The Franklin Institute and the School District of Philadelphia. SLA is a 1:1 project-based laptop school where all students and teachers use laptops as their primary learning tool.\n\nScience Leadership Academy was created by the board of the Franklin Institute and founding principal, Christopher Lehmann. The 'Mission and Visions' page of the school's website describes the school as, \"a partnership high school between the School District of Philadelphia and The Franklin Institute. SLA is an inquiry-driven, project-based high school focused on 21st century learning that opened its doors on September 7, 2006. SLA provides a rigorous, college-preparatory curriculum with a focus on science, technology, mathematics and entrepreneurship. Students at SLA learn in a project-based environment where the core values of inquiry, research, collaboration, presentation, and reflection are emphasized in all classes.\" \n\nIn Spring 2009, SLA was named an Apple Distinguished School, as of 2009 one of only 33 schools in the nation so named. In addition, SLA was featured in the April 2007 Edutopia Magazine article, \"My School, Meet MySpace\" where the school is called \"... [John] Dewey for the digital age, old-fashioned progressive education with a technological twist.\"\n\nThe school has received speeches from a number of distinguished individuals over the years, including Bill Gates, Chairman of Microsoft and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, who spoke to the students of SLA on Thursday, April 29, 2010 and Steven Squyres, lead researcher on the Mars Land-Rover project who first visited the school in 2007 and was SLA's keynote speaker at their first graduation on June 15, 2010.\n\nIn a September 2010 issue of Ladies Home Journal, SLA was named one of ten in \"America's Most Amazing Schools\".\n\nIn October 2010, Apple.com published a case study of SLA on their Education web page.\n\nIn March 2011, SLA was featured in the PBS documentary Digital Media: New Learners for the 21st Century.\n\nIn March 2012, Apple.com featured SLA in their video about iBooks and iBooksAuthor.\n\nIn June 2012, President Barack Obama came to the Franklin Institute. He was there to congratulate the graduating seniors of Science Leadership Academy. The president said, \"My expectation is that somebody in this auditorium is going to figure out new sources of energy that help not only make us more energy independent but also deals with the problems like climate change. There is somebody in this room who is going to make sure that we are defeating diseases like Alzheimer's or find a cure for cancer.\"\nPresident Obama said that the students' talents would mean a bright future for the United States.\n\nEach student of SLA, (along with the teachers), receives their own personal laptop, which they are responsible for throughout the school year. The majority of school work is done on the computers through the school's Canvas course-management system. The school also has some of the largest and most extensive lab areas in the entire school district, with four lab classrooms. Two are located on the 2nd floor and the other two on the 3rd. These classrooms are large in space, combining both a usual SLA classroom along with the lab areas, allowing students to conduct experiments on a regular basis opposed to the occasional one as in many other schools. Students do benchmark projects every quarter to demonstrate the application of their learning, with the aid of the five \"core values\" (see below).\n\nThe location of the school building was decided upon its proximity to the Franklin Institute, as well as being in the heart of Downtown Philadelphia. The building itself was formerly an office building (for the Human Resources department of the School District of Philadelphia), which was completely renovated for SLA. In total, the building is five stories tall (though the school only uses the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th floors), contains three elevators (reserved for teachers and disabled students only), and three main stairwells, with one that gives access to the 1st-3rd floors, and the other two for the 1st–5th floors. One interesting feature to the building, dubbed the \"Pool\" by the students, is a large cutout structure, (with the interior walls painted blue that give it its name), located on the second floor which looks into the 1st-floor café.This space was originally planned to be a grand staircase that leads visitors straight from the front door to the office, however, engineering conflicts did not allow for this. Also, two ballrooms, (located in the middle of the 2nd and 3rd floors) were supposed to be staircases that were connected as well, though the same conflicts denied those plans. The lease for these plans ends in 2019. At that point, Science Leadership Academy has plans to renovate and move into Benjamin Franklin High School's facility. The building will be renovated to fit the two schools how they see fit. \n\nOn September 9, 2013, the school opened a second campus in the Wynnefield area of Philadelphia and graduated its first class in June 2017. SLA@Beeber originally shared a building with Beeber Middle School. After delaying a closure decision in 2013, the Philadelphia School Reform Commission recommended in 2015 that Beeber Middle School be phased out over a two year period. SLA@Beeber is now the only occupant of the building, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance to educational architecture. In the 2018-2019 school year, the school welcomed its first fifth grade class. The school's founding principal is Christopher Johnson. They have created many new partnerships with places such as PAFA and St. Joseph's University.\n\nOn September 7, 2016, the third campus of Science Leadership Academy - Science Leadership Academy Middle School opened in the Powelton Village neighborhood of Philadelphia. The school (SLA-MS) opened with a 5th grade and will grow a grade until it houses a 5th through 8th grade. The founding principal is Timothy Boyle and the school is currently housed in the Dornsife Center on 35th and Spring Garden Sts as part of their partnership with Drexel University. The website for the school is http://www.slamiddle.org. \n\nThe Science Leadership Academy is an understanding-driven, project-based school where the learning is centered around the five core values of inquiry, research, collaboration, presentation and reflection.\n\nStudents ask questions about their topic that will allow them to fully understand it. They also inquire about the things they do not know about said topic.\n\nWith their resources, students research their topics in depth using credible sources.\n\nStudents collaborate with classmates and others to continue their spectrum of learning.\n\nStudents convey their thoughts, ideas, and findings through their presentations.\n\nStudents reflect on the work, along with successes and failures and see what they can do to improve on future work.\n\n\n"}

The Guide serves as \"the standard repository for all knowledge and wisdom\" for many members of the series' galaxy-spanning civilization. Entries from the guidebook are used as comic narration to bridge events and provide background information in every version of the story. The guide is published by \"Megadodo Publications\", a publishing company on Ursa Minor Beta.\n\nIn the original radio scripts, the Guide's voice was called the \"Narrator\" and in the 2004–2005 series, \"The Voice\". For all of the radio series and the 1981 TV series, the role was credited as \"The Book\", though this was changed to \"Narrator/The Guide\" for the 2005 movie.\n\nIn the first two phases of the radio series, the LP album adaptations of the first radio series and in the television series, the Guide was voiced by British actor Peter Jones. During the 2004–2005 radio series, \"The Guide\" was voiced by William Franklyn. In the film version, it was voiced by Stephen Fry. In the Hexagonal Phase of the radio series, based on the novel, \"And Another Thing...\", the Guide was voiced by the series co-creator John Lloyd. \n\nThe \"Guide\"'s numerous entries are quoted throughout the various incarnations of the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" series. As well as offering background information, the Guide's entries often employ irony, sarcasm and subtle commentary on the action and on life in general. For instance, the entry on the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation describes their marketing division as \"a bunch of mindless jerks who will be the first against the wall when the revolution comes\", with a footnote to the effect that the editors would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over the post of robotics correspondent. The entry on the villainous Vogons begins, \"Here's what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: forget it.\" The entry on \"What to do if you find yourself stuck in a crack in the ground underneath a giant boulder you can't move, with no hope of rescue\" suggests that first, you \"consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far. Alternatively, if life hasn't been good to you so far, which given your current circumstances seems more likely, consider how lucky you are that it won't be troubling you much longer.\" Its advice on drunkenness is simply, \"Go to it, and good luck\", and according to the 2005 film, its entry on love is \"Avoid it at all costs\".\n\nThe \"Guide\" tends to focus on certain topics. For instance, if looking for information about sex, the \"Guide\" suggests reading \"chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the \"Guide\".\" On the \"Guide\"'s outdated and typo-filled entries (some of which could cause serious injury or death, such as \"Ravenous Bugblatter Beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists,\" rather than \"Ravenous bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal \"of\" visiting tourists.\") Adams wrote, \"...though it cannot hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does make the reassuring claim that where it is inaccurate, it is at least \"definitively\" inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it was always reality that's got it wrong.\"\n\nDespite the work of dedicated field researchers such as Ford Prefect, many of the contributions to the \"Guide\" are made on a strictly ad-hoc basis. With the permanent staff more likely to be on a lunch break than working, \"most of the actual work got done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices of an afternoon and saw something worth doing.\" This has led to the \"Guide\" being patchy in its coverage, cobbled together (for example: the entry on \"The Universe\" was copied from the back of a packet of breakfast cereal) and often riddled with errors.\n\nAlthough Ford puts together a lengthy and detailed entry on Earth during the 15 years he is stranded there, the editors cut it down to two words: \"Mostly harmless.\" In \"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\", he is stunned to see his entire original work restored during a database update, even though he saw the planet being demolished by the Vogons. The change turns out to be necessary because another Earth has been pulled into existence from a parallel universe by dolphins in order to prevent humans from becoming extinct.\n\nThe \"Guide\" can receive updates to its data base via Sub-Etha. Field researchers (like Ford Prefect) can also use the Guide to edit entries and transmit these back to the publisher.\n\nAt the start of the series, the Guide was published by Megadodo Publications, one of the \"great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor.\" When Megadodo was bought out by Infinidim Enterprises in \"Mostly Harmless\", the new editor in chief, Vann Harl, changed the Guide's demographic from penniless hitchhikers to families in billions of billions of alternate worlds, thus altering the Guide's original purpose. When Ford learned of this plan, he knocked out Vann Harl and stole his Ident-I-Eeze card to increase the spending limit on Ford's own Dine-O-Charge card. Ford was thus able to use his Dine-O-Charge to buy (among other things): a pink spaceship, all the foie gras in London, and The London Zoo, in addition to buying the hotel he was staying at for the concierge, all charged to the Guide and Infinidim Enterprises.\n\nThe Guide is described as resembling \"a small, thin, flexible lap computer\" encased in a \"sturdy plastic cover\" with the words \"Don't Panic\" inscribed on it \"in large, friendly letters\". It is presumably of robust construction, making it able to withstand falling through time/space wormholes and being thrown into swamps, being rescued, and still operating. Arthur Dent's copy survived a spaceship crash which melted the ship into something unrecognizable yet the Guide (and on-board entertainment system) survived. Its entries are arranged alphabetically on the screen and accessed via typing entry codes on a keyboard; \"Earth\" is on the same page as \"Eccentrica Gallumbits, the Triple-Breasted Whore of Eroticon 6.\" In \"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\" the Guide's \"current tally\" of pages is said to be 5,973,509.\n\nIn the film, the Guide is depicted as a large metal book with a large screen instead of pages. Entries here are reached by voice activation (e.g. saying the word \"Vogon\" will bring up the article on Vogons, etc.)\n\nAt the start, the \"Guide\" is merely an information resource, although one with a distinctly flippant and exuberant tone. Its introduction begins with the words, \"Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean you may think it's a long walk down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen...\" However, in the fifth novel, \"Mostly Harmless\", a new edition of the \"Guide\", the \"Guide\" Mark II, is published that is artificially intelligent and capable of interacting with the reader. This \"Guide\", which takes the form of a black, birdlike robot, appears pleasant and friendly but is in fact deeply malevolent and in league with the Vogons in a plot to destroy Earth. Strangely enough, it saves all the main characters from certain doom as part of some unknown agenda and disappears from existence shortly before the Grebulons destroy Earth at the beginning of the sixth book in the series, \"And Another Thing\" by Eoin Colfer.\n\nIn the original radio series, Peter Jones provided the voice for \"The Book\" as both the \"Guide\" itself and as the overall narrator. When speaking as the \"Guide\", Jones's voice was electronically filtered to sound mechanical, and spoken against simple electronic music. When speaking merely as the narrator, his voice was left unfiltered. In the television series, Jones's voice was left unfiltered for both the \"Guide\" and \"general\" narrations, which were accompanied by hand-drawn animations representing computer readouts. These animations often contained little jokes, such as the full text of the \"worst poetry in the universe\", the equation of 37 Earth miles as \"1 Altairian long way\", the inclusion of a topping of meringue on a Magrathea-constructed planet, and the outcome of an intergalactic war represented as a video game score. The 2005 film, which featured Stephen Fry as the voice of the \"Guide\", also employed animations, but in a more minimalist, abstract style. They were animated by Shynola.\n\nAdams conceived of the \"Guide\" while hitchhiking from London to Istanbul in 1971. Drunk and penniless in a field in Innsbruck, Austria, Adams looked up at the stars and then at his stolen copy of \"Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe\" and thought that someone should write \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" \"The Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe\" claimed in its introduction that it was possible to survive in Europe on less than US$25 a week, a claim echoed in the catchphrase of the \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" that it was the best source of advice for those who wanted to see the universe \"on less than 30 Altairian dollars a day.\"\n\nDouglas Adams, who was deeply involved with computer technology, founded the website h2g2 in 1999. In keeping with the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\"'s tradition of being edited by random people off the street, h2g2 is an encyclopedia edited by thousands of contributors. The site's creation predates Wikipedia by two years, though several commentators have noted the similarities between Wikipedia and the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\", particularly its wild variance in reliability and quality and its tendency to focus on topics of interest to its writers.\n\nIn 2000 Adams wrote:\n\nSome have compared Apple's iPad and Amazon's Kindle to the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\"; indeed fans have designed \"Don't Panic\" covers for both.\n\nCombining tablets or e-readers with (offline) Wikipedia is often considered the closest existing equivalent to the Hitchhiker's Guide to date. An app for the iPad allows you to read \"Guide\" entries as they appeared in the various \"Hitchhikers\" media.\n\n"}

In addition to the main ranking, the organisation awards a series of special prizes for individuals and restaurants, including the One To Watch award, the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Chefs' Choice Award, the latter based on votes from the fifty head chefs from the restaurants on the previous year's list. Often working as a barometer of global gastronomic trends, the list showcases a variety of cuisines from all over the world. The top restaurants have sometimes been forerunners of molecular gastronomy. Most of the restaurants serve haute cuisine, which is characterized by the meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food.\n\nThe first place on the list has been dominated by elBulli and Noma. In 2002 and 2006–2009, elBulli was determined to be the world's best restaurant, winning more times than any other restaurant. In 2010, Noma received the first place award. It was maintained in 2011 and again in 2012. After defending its title for the third time, chef René Redzepi said that 1,204 customers were wait-listed for the evening, compared to 14 customers from two years before. However, in 2013 El Celler De Can Roca took over the first position before Noma regained it in 2014. In 2018, Osteria Francescana regained the crown it had held in 2016, after dropping to second in 2017, when Eleven Madison Park topped the poll.\n\nThe list originated as a one-off stunt by the staff of \"Restaurant\" magazine, who came up with the idea at the Shaston Arms public house in London's Carnaby Street. It was more successful than they expected and soon became established as a major event in the culinary world.\n\nThe World's 50 Best Restaurants list is compiled from the votes of the \"World’s 50 Best Restaurants Academy\", a group of 26 panels established to make the ranking. The world is divided into regions, with a chairperson in each region appointed for their knowledge of their part of the restaurant world. These chairs each selected a voting panel of 40 members, who every year cast thousands of votes.\n\nThere is no list of nominees; each member of the international voting panel votes for their own personal choice of ten restaurants. Up to six votes can be cast for restaurants in the voter's own region, while at least four must go to restaurants outside of the home region. No voting member is allowed to vote for their own restaurant, or one in which they have an economic interest, and voters must have eaten in the restaurants they nominate within the past 18 months. The integrity of the voting process and the resulting list is adjudicated by global consultancy firm Deloitte. \n\nThe criteria are different from those of the \"Michelin Guide\" or other guides, which has allowed restaurants like Momofuku Ssam Bar, Asador Etxebarri and St. John to hold their own among the molecular or traditional cuisine of restaurants such as The Fat Duck, Les Ambassadeurs or The French Laundry.\n\nThe Chefs' Choice Award is voted for by the head chefs of the restaurants in the list, who choose a peer who has made a positive impact in the restaurant industry in the previous year.\n\n\n\nThe World's 50 Best Restaurants list has been criticised; writing in \"The Guardian\" in 2003 Matthew Fort described the list as \"humbug\". The French food writer and critic says the ranking lacks reliability, while the Spanish chef Martín Berasategui spoke of \"rigged\" ranking, manipulated by an \"important international food company\" in order to \"cause damage\" to the Michelin Guide. The list has also been criticised as lacking female representation and being overly Eurocentric.\n\n\n"}

Rauti was later ousted by Luca Romagnoli, who took the leadership.\n\nIn the 2004 European Parliamentary Election the party gained enough votes in the Southern constituency to elect Luca Romagnoli to the European Parliament. The party was then a member of the House of Freedoms coalition for the 2006 general election.\n\nIn the coming of the 2008 general election, Tricolour Flame formed a joint list called The Right–Tricolour Flame with The Right of Francesco Storace, a splinter group of National Alliance, in support of the candidacy of Daniela Santanchè for Prime Minister.\n\nOn 8 November 2013, Luca Romagnoli, secretary of Tricolour Flame, together with the secretary of The Right Francesco Storace, the regent of Future and Freedom Roberto Menia, the leader of I the South Adriana Poli Bortone, Domenico Nania of the association New Alliance, Oreste Tofani of the association \"Nazione Sovrana\", Antonio Buonfiglio of the association \"Il Popolo della Vita\" and Roberto Buonasorte, editor of the online newspaper \"Il Giornale d'Italia\", founded the Movement for National Alliance, a federation of right movements inspired to National Alliance.\nOn 9 December 2013 the Central Committee of Tricolour Flame distrusted Luca Romagnoli, because he joined this initiative without having preventively sought the opinion of the same Committee, and Attilio Carelli became regent Secretary of the party. After the expulsion Romagnoli founded instead his new political movement, Social Right.\n\nOn 13 and 14 December 2014, the VII National Congress officially appointed Carelli as Secretary of the party.\n\nFor the 2018 general election, it formed the Italy for the Italians coalition along with the New Force party.\n\nTricolour Flame is the party of the Italian far-right most closely tied to the legacy of Italian Social Republic (RSI). The RSI is usually seen by the party as the example of what Fascism should have been, in particular as an example of true welfare state. As a sign of this legacy, the party, for example, guarantees free membership for ex-RSI military. A press release from the Rome section of the party states:\nTricolour Flame maintains a fairly strong anti-capitalist stance, and it can be thought to be the Italian party closest to third positionist ideology.\n\nRecently Tricolour Flame has been peculiar, among Italian neo-fascist organizations, in actively trying to attract the young masses and renewing its political practices and communication techniques in a more modern, innovative fashion. Political manifests often tend towards attractive, modern graphics and clear-cut, even humorous slogans. Tricolour Flame is also very close to youth far-right organizations and initiatives, of which the most relevant is CasaPound, a social centre in Rome.\n\nThe party is against the regionalism promoted by the Northern League for an independent \"Padania\", instead favoring a united Italy.\n\nAmong the more controversial members of Tricolur Flame are Pietro Puschiavo and Maurizio Boccacci. In 1985 Puschiavo was a founding member of the Veneto Skinheads Front, a far-right skinhead group based in Veneto and connected to Blood and Honour. Boccacci is the former leader of the Western Political Movement, a far-right skinhead organization based in Rome.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39802440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39802440", "title": "Trusted execution environment", "text": "Trusted execution environment\n\nA trusted execution environment (TEE) is a secure area of a main processor. It guarantees code and data loaded inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. A TEE as an isolated execution environment provides security features such as isolated execution, integrity of applications executing with the TEE, along with confidentiality of their assets. In general terms, the TEE offers an execution space that provides a higher level of security than a rich mobile operating system open (mobile OS) and more functionality than a 'secure element' (SE).\n\nIndustry associations like GlobalPlatform (working to standardize specifications for the TEE) and Trusted Computing Group (working to align GlobalPlatform TEE specification with its Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology for enhanced mobile security) have undertaken work in recent years.\n\nOpen Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP) first defined TEE in their 'Advanced Trusted Environment:OMTP TR1' standard, defining it as a \"set of hardware and software components providing facilities necessary to support Applications\" which had to meet the requirements of one of two defined security levels. The first security level, Profile 1, was targeted against only software attacks and whilst Profile 2, was targeted against both software and hardware attacks.\n\nCommercial TEE solutions based on ARM TrustZone technology which conformed to the TR1 standard such as Trusted Foundations, developed by Trusted Logic, were later launched. This software would become part of the Trustonic joint venture, and the basis of future GlobalPlatform TEE solutions.\n\nWork on the OMTP standards ended in mid 2010 when the group transitioned into the 'Wholesale Applications Community' (WAC).\n\nThe OMTP standards, including those defining a TEE, are hosted by GSMA.\n\nIn July 2010 GlobalPlatform first announced their own standardisation of the TEE, focusing first on the client API (the interface to the TEE within the mobile OS) which was expanded later to include the TEE internal API, a Remote Administration framework, a compliance programme and standardised security level.\n\nThe TEE is an isolated environment that runs in parallel with the operating system, providing security for the rich environment. It is intended to be more secure than the User-facing OS (which GlobalPlatform calls the REE or Rich Execution Environment) and offers a higher level of performance and functionality than a Secure Element (SE), using a hybrid approach that utilizes both hardware and software to protect data. It therefore offers a level of security sufficient for many applications. Trusted applications running in a TEE have access to the full power of a device's main processor and memory, while hardware isolation protects these from user installed apps running in a main operating system. Software and cryptographic isolation inside the TEE protect the trusted applications contained within from each other.\n\nService providers, mobile network operators (MNO), operating system developers, application developers, device manufacturers, platform providers and silicon vendors are the main stakeholders contributing to the standardization efforts around the TEE.\n\nTo prevent simulation of hardware with a user-controlled software \na hardware root of trust is used. To simulate the hardware in a way enabling it to pass remote authentication an attacker should extract keys from the hardware, which is costly because of used equipment and reverse engineering skills required (focused ion beam, scanning electron microscope, microprobing, decapsulation) or even impossible if the hardware is designed in a way that reverse engineering destroys the keys. In some cases the keys are unique for each piece of hardware, so a key extracted from one chip is useless for another ones.\n\nThere are a number of use cases for the TEE. Though not all possible use cases exploit the deprivation of ownership, TEE is usually used exactly for this.\n\nPremium Content Protection / Digital Rights Management\n\nNote: Much TEE literature covers this topic under the definition \"premium content protection\" which is the preferred nomenclature of many copyright holders. Premium content protection is a specific use case of Digital Rights Management (DRM), and is controversial among some communities. It is widely used by copyrights holders to restrict the ways in which end users can consume content such as 4K high definition films.\n\nThe TEE is a suitable environment for protecting digitally encoded information (for example, HD films or audio) on connected devices such as smart phones, tablets and HD televisions. This suitability comes from the ability of the TEE to deprive owner of the device from reading stored secrets, and the fact that there is often a protected hardware path between the TEE and the display and/or subsystems on devices.\n\nThe TEE is used to protect the content once it is on the device: while the content is protected during transmission or streaming by the use of encryption, the TEE protects the content once it has been decrypted on the device by ensuring that decrypted content is not exposed to the environment not approved by app developer OR platform vendor.\n\nMobile financial services\n\nMobile Commerce applications such as: mobile wallets, peer-to-peer payments, contactless payments or using a mobile device as a point of sale (POS) terminal) often have well-defined security requirements. TEEs can be used, often in conjunction with near field communication (NFC), SEs and trusted backend systems to provide the security required to enable financial transactions to take place.\n\nIn some scenarios, interaction with the end user is required, and this may require the user to expose sensitive information such as a PIN, password or biometric identifier to the mobile OS as a means of authenticating the user. The TEE optionally offers a trusted user interface which can be used to construct user authentication on a mobile device.\n\nAuthentication\n\nThe TEE is well-suited for supporting biometric ID methods (facial recognition, fingerprint sensor and voice authorization), which may be easier to use and harder to steal than PINs and passwords. The authentication process is generally split into three main stages:\n\n\nA TEE is a good area within a mobile device to house the matching engine and the associated processing required to authenticate the user. The environment is designed to protect the data and establish a buffer against the non-secure apps located in mobile OS. This additional security may help to satisfy the security needs of service providers in addition to keeping the costs low for handset developers.\n\nThe FIDO Alliance is collaborating with GlobalPlatform to standardize the TEE for natural ID implementations.\n\nEnterprise and government\n\nThe TEE can be used by governments and enterprises to enable the secure handling of confidential information on a mobile device. The TEE offers a level of protection against software attacks generated in the mobile OS and assists in the control of access rights. It achieves this by housing sensitive, ‘trusted’ applications that need to be isolated and protected from the mobile OS and any malicious malware that may be present. Through utilizing the functionality and security levels offered by the TEE, governments and enterprises can be assured that employees using their own devices are doing so in a secure and trusted manner.\n\nSecure Modular Programming\n\nWith the rise of software assets and reuses, Modular programming is the most productive process to design software architecture, by decoupling the functionalities into small independent modules. As each module contains everything necessary to execute its desired functionality, the TEE allows to organize the complete system featuring a high level of reliability and security, while preventing each module from vulnerabilities of the others.\n\nThe following embedded hardware technologies can be used to support TEE implementations:\n\nSeveral TEE implementations are available from different TEE providers:\n\nWhile there are a number of proprietary systems, GlobalPlatform is working to standardize the TEE. Standardizing the TEE is helpful for implementers of mobile wallets, NFC payment implementations, premium content protection and bring your own device (BYOD) initiatives.\n\nThese following TEE specifications are currently available from the GlobalPlatform website:\n\nTrustonic was the company to qualify a GlobalPlatform-compliant TEE product. Since then, a significant number of GlobalPlatform TEE implementations have become available. A list of those which have been formally qualified by GlobalPlatform can be found at, and many other TEE products offer a high level of compatibility with GlobalPlatform standards.\n\nThe GlobalPlatform TEE Protection Profile specifies the typical threats the hardware and software of the TEE needs to withstand. It also details the security objectives that are to be met in order to counter these threats and the security functional requirements that a TEE will have to comply with. A security assurance level of EAL2+ has been selected; the focus is on vulnerabilities that are subject to widespread, software-based exploitation.\n\nThe Common Criteria portal has officially listed the GlobalPlatform TEE Protection Profile on its website, under the Trusted Computing category. This important milestone means that industries using TEE technology to deliver services such as premium content and mobile wallets, or enterprises and governments establishing secure mobility solutions, can now formally request that TEE products are certified against this security framework.\n\nGlobalPlatform is committed to ensuring a standardized level of security for embedded applications on secure chip technology. It has developed an open and thoroughly evaluated trusted execution environment (TEE) ecosystem with accredited laboratories and evaluated products. This certification scheme created to certify a TEE product in 3 months has been launched officially in June 2015\n\n"}
