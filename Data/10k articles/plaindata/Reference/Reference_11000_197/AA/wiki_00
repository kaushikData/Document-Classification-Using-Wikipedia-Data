The fictional story of Anna Seashell played by Lili Taylor, is of a woman who is able to find the glass half full when she is given the same diagnosis. The documentary follows Alex as she uses narrative film to show her journey through terminal illness as it surrounds her and her families life.\n\nA Woman Like Me is a documentary about co-director Alex Sichel's navigation through having terminal breast cancer and how it has inspired her to try and embrace death as mentioned in Buddhist philosophy. The film is composed of home videos, one on one sit downs with Alex's family; husband, parents, sisters, doctors, and healers. Although a documentary, half of the movie shows Alex's current film project about Anna, a woman with the same diagnosis as Alex except she looks at the glass as half full. The film within the film recounts private conversations between Alex and her husband, Alex's dreams, and the alter-self, Anna, who is moving forward to face her fear of death. Sichel believes that making a movie about herself living with breast cancer can help her heal and accept what is happening to her.\n\nThe documentary side of the film shows Alex's doctor visits, the types of medications she's on, and the alternative medicine healing practices she does with healers and shamans. Alex's family, although glad Alex is taking medicine from the \"real\" doctors, believe healers and the Buddhist philosophy of \"going joyfully towards death\" are not helpful and is just \"magical thinking\". Alex later learns that the tumor has grown larger so, she takes the opportunity to go to Greece and learn more about her family's history. The last scene of the film shows that Alex has lived another winter and is once again at the Buddhist silent retreat that she attends yearly. She mentions how her daughter's birthday is coming up so she needs to look forward with positive thoughts.\n\n\nSXSW's Special Jury Prize for Directing \n"}

According to they inhabited the region later known as Edom and Moab in the days of Abraham. Their name may come from a Hebrew root meaning \"necklace\" or \"neck-chain\".\n\nTheir formidable appearance, as described by the Twelve Spies sent to search the land, filled the Israelites with terror. The Israelites seem to have identified them with the Nephilim, the giants (, ) of the antediluvian age. Joshua finally expelled them from the land, except for some that found a refuge in the Philistine cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod (), thus the Philistine giants (Goliath) whom David encountered (2 Samuel 21:15-22 ) were descendants of the Anakim.\n\n"}

He was an active wrestler between 1956 and 1984, and won numerous championship throughout his career. He worked for promotions in both Canada and the United States, particularly in Ontario, California, Minneapolis, Texas, Georgia, and Oklahoma. He won numerous tag team championships throughout his career, including with Dick Beyer, who was his real-life brother-in-law, as well as Fritz Von Erich, Bill Watts, and Ray Gunkel. He also won singles championships, including the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship.\n\nAfter his retirement from in-ring competition, he would work for Maple Leaf Wrestling in Toronto and the World Wrestling Federation.\n\nSnip made his debut in 1956, under the name Billy Lyons, but soon became known as Billy Red Lyons, due to the colour of his hair. During ths first years of his career, he wrestle against future world champions, including Buddy Rogers and Gene Kiniski.\n\nDuring his career, he held several tag team championships with Dick Beyer, who was his real-life brother-in-law, as well as Fritz Von Erich, Bill Watts, and Ray Gunkel. He won his first championship in February 1958, when he teamed with Ray Gunkel to win the NWA International Tag Team Championship. Three years later, he won the NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship with Ilio DiPaolo, by defeating Stan Kowalski and Tiny Mills on January 26, 1961. Lyons and DiPaolo were the last champions, however, as the championships was abandoned and replaced with the Toronto version of the NWA International Tag Team Championship a few months later. Lyons eventually won this championship with Whipper Billy Watson on March 28, 1962, by defeating Chris and John Tolos. They lost the championship to Bulldog Brower and Sweet Daddy Siki five days later on April 2. On March 27, 1965, Lyons teamed with Beyer, who was using the ring name The Destroyer, to win the AWA World Tag Team Championship from Don Manoukian and Ray Stevens. On June 3, 1965, they won the All Asia Tag Team Championship in the Japan Wrestling Association from Giant Baba and Toyonobori. They lost the championship to Baba and Tonobori just over a month later on July 15, 1965. While wrestling in the American Wrestling Association in the 1960s, Lyons was billed as the AWA British Empire Heavyweight Champion.\n\nIn 1967, Lyons won his first singles championship, by defeating Duke Keomuka by forfeit in the finals of a tournament in San Antonio, Texas to win the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship on November 8. He held the championship for nearly six months, eventually losing it to The Spoiler #1 on March 29, 1968, in Houston, Texas. During this time, he won the NWA American Tag Team Championship with Fritz von Erich on January 30, 1968, in Dallas, Texas by defeating Gary Hart and Spoiler.\n\nLyons won the NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Tri-State version) with Bill Watts in January 1971, by defeating Buddy Roberts and Jerry Brown. They lost the championship to Karl Von Brauner and Waldo Von Erich in March, but Lyons won it back with Tom Jones by defeating The Spoilers (The Spoiler #1 and The Spoiler #2) on May 31. The following year, Lyons again teamed with Jones to win the NWA Mississippi Tag Team Championship in March 1972. Jones later said that Lyons was the \"best partner I ever had\", and credited Lyons with teaching him the psychology of wrestling. Throughout the late '60s and early '70s, he teamed with Red Bastien as The Flying Redheads, and on July 14, 1974, Lyons and Bastien won the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship by defeating Mike York and Frank Monte. They held the championship for three months, but lost it to Chris Colt and Bobby Duncum on October 6, 1972. Bastien later said that he and Lyons \"were perfect for each other\" as tag team partners. Fellow professional wrestler Blackjack Mulligan said that Bastien and Lyons \"were the greatest team of all time\", and that watching them wrestle was watching \"pure tag team wrestling at its basic\".\n\nFollowing this, he returned to Toronto to compete for Maple Leaf Wrestling. He began teaming with Dewey Robertson in 1974, as the Crusaders, and they won the Toronto version of the NWA International Tag Team Championship on three occasions. They defeated Hartford and Reginald Love for the championship on June 23, 1974, but dropped it to them on September 8. They defeated them for the championship again on December 29, 1974. He also challenged Jack Brisco for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a 1974 Maple Leaf Gardens main event. On June 8, 1975, the Crusaders were beaten by the Kelly Twins (Pat and Mike) for the championship, but they won it back two months later on August 24. They were the final champions, however, as the championship was retired in September 1977.\n\nAfter his retirement from active competition in 1984, he settled in Toronto and began working for Maple Leaf Wrestling in Toronto as an assistant to promoters Frank and Jack Tunney. Shortly after he would become affiliated with the World Wrestling Federation when Jack Tunney allied Maple Leaf Wrestling with the American-based wrestling company. Lyons would serve as a WWF television announcer, interviewer and ring announcer. He became famous for his catchphrase, \"Don'tcha dare miss it!\" Backstage, he remained Jack Tunney's top assistant. Lyons was released in 1995, along with Tunney, due to budget cuts and dissolution of the WWF/Maple Leaf Wrestling association.\n\nSnip was the real-life brother-in-law of Dick Beyer, with whom he won the All Asia Tag Team Championship. He was also a talented ice hockey player, before he became a professional wrestler. Greg Oliver, the producer of Canadian Online Explorer's wrestling section, described Snip as having a \"sly, cheeky sense of humour\", and a man that \"never took himself too seriously\".\n\nHe died on June 22, 2009, aged 77, from cancer, which had spread to his spine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "852500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=852500", "title": "British Hit Singles &amp; Albums", "text": "British Hit Singles &amp; Albums\n\nBritish Hit Singles & Albums (originally known as The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles and The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums) was a music reference book originally published in the United Kingdom by the publishing arm of the Guinness breweries, Guinness Superlatives. Later editions were published by Guinness World Records and HiT Entertainment. It listed all the singles and albums featured in the Top 75 pop charts in the UK. In 2004 the book became an amalgamation of two earlier Guinness publications, originally known as British Hit Singles and British Hit Albums. The publication of this amalgamation ceased in 2008. A new version of the book published by Virgin and entitled \"The Virgin Book of British Hit Singles\", first published in November 2008.\n\nThe first ten editions were compiled by Paul Gambaccini, Mike Read and brothers Tim Rice and Jonathan \"Jo\" Rice. Read left the team in the mid-1980s and the other editors resigned in 1996. Chart editor for many editions was David Roberts.\n\n\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" was generally considered to be the authoritative reference (and only) source for both the UK Singles Chart (since its inception in 1952) and the UK Albums Chart. It listed all the singles and albums ever to have been in the UK charts since 1952 (albums since 1958), listing them in alphabetical order and by both artist and song title. The entries also included the date of chart entry, highest position, catalogue number and number of weeks in the chart. Short biographical notes accompanied many of the artists' chart details.\n\nThe book's sources are the \"New Musical Express\" (NME) chart from November 1952 to March 1960, and the \"Record Retailer\" (later \"Music Week\") chart thereafter. It could be said that this division is misleading, since the \"Record Retailer\" chart was little known until it was adopted by the BBC in 1969 and that by adopting this chart as its standard, the editors had a non-consensual view. An example often given is the case of The Beatles' second single \"Please Please Me\" which was recognised as a number one hit by every other publicly available chart of the time, but not by \"Record Retailer\" and therefore not by \"British Hit Singles\". Other records to which this applies include \"19th Nervous Breakdown\" by The Rolling Stones, \"Stranger on the Shore\" by Acker Bilk and the Eurovision Song Contest entry \"Are You Sure?\" by The Allisons.\n\nCo-founder Jo Rice has defended the book's choice of source material on the grounds that \"Record Retailer\" was the only chart to consistently publish a Top 50 from 1960 onwards. This can be substantiated by the fact that charts published in the \"NME\" were of a shorter format and other chart listings such as those in \"Melody Maker\", became less and less informative although they were probably more accurate. Subsequent research has shown that during the \"disputed\" period of the 1960s, the samples sizes of the \"Record Retailer\" chart were considerably inferior to those of the other charts: around 30 shops in 1963 in comparison to more than 100 used by \"Melody Maker\", and later around 80 in comparison to \"NME\"s 150 and \"Melody Maker\"s 200. As a result, the placings in that chart were more open to error and manipulation – a situation further worsened by the larger number of records listed in the chart.\n\nThe first edition was published as \"The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles\" in July 1977. It wasn't the first Guinness music reference publication, as the previous year a book called \"The Guinness Book of Music Facts & Feats\" had been published. It also contained feats from the world of classical music.\n\nThe first edition was issued to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the first UK singles sales chart, which was published in November 1952, by the \"New Musical Express\". Subsequently, a new edition was published every two years, adding a few hundred titles to each edition.\n\nKeeping in line with the book's parent publication \"The Guinness Book of Records\", each edition of \"British Hit Singles\" also contained a 'facts and feats' section, which included various lists of remarkable chart feats such as 'Most hits', 'Most no. 1 hits', 'Most weeks on chart' or 'Least successful chart artist'. Also included in the books were photographs (often with captions) and introductions written by the four authors. They also wrote a bi-annual lookback on the major developments in the UK charts in the two preceding years.\n\nThe series was soon regarded as the number one source for music and chart reference, thanks to the commercial success of the books and its various sister publications (see below).\n\nThe series' 10th edition, published in June 1995, was the last to feature its original authors Rice, Rice and Gambaccini. From the 11th edition onwards, the book was compiled by in-house editors at Guinness Publishing and, later, by David Roberts who had already been a chart editor and designer for the original team.\n\nFrom the 12th edition onwards (published in 1999), the book was published every year rather than bi-annually. In 2004, the book merged with \"The Guinness Book of British Hit Albums\" to form \"The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums\". The eighteenth edition of the book (2005) was billed as a \"Special Collector's Edition\" as it featured detailed information on the 1,000 Number Ones in the UK Singles Chart from Al Martino's \"Here in My Heart\" on 14 November 1952 to Elvis Presley's \"One Night / I Got Stung\" (Limited Edition Collector's re-issue), 22 January 2005.\nThe 19th edition (2006) was the last in the series. A supposed 20th edition was due to be published in 2007, but apparently the original publishers lost interest in chart reference books after their contract with The Official Charts Company expired, which saw that organisation sell the contract to Virgin.\n\nFollowing the success of the \"Guinness Book of British Hit Singles\" series, the original authors and Guinness quickly turned to other charts-related books and projects. The following books were written by them:\n\nIn the late 1990s and 2000s several other merchandise was produced, such as karaoke CDs, a calendar, a DVD quiz (\"British Hit Albums and Singles No. 1 Music Quiz\") and a series of themed compilation CDs with original hits from the book.\n\n\n"}

The survey attempts to measure the degree of economic freedom in the world's nations. It has been used in peer-reviewed studies some of which have found a range of beneficial effects of more economic freedom.\n\nOne of the earliest measures of economic freedom was developed by Freedom House, which has done extensive work on the measurement of political and cultural freedom. This measure incorporated a range of indicators including freedom to establish a business and freedom of union organisation.\n\nPartly in response to dissatisfaction with the Freedom House index from advocates of a libertarian or market liberal viewpoint, Milton Friedman and Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute hosted a series of conferences on economic freedom. Eventually this resulted in a report on worldwide economic freedom, \"Economic Freedom of the World\". Later the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal created another similar index, the \"Index of Economic Freedom\".\n\nThe participants in the conferences reached a consensus that the cornerstones of economic freedom are: personal choice rather than collective choice, voluntary exchange coordinated by markets rather than allocation via the political process, freedom to enter and compete in markets, protection of persons and their property from aggression by others. The 2005 report states \"When the functions of the minimal state—protection of people and their property from the actions of aggressors, enforcement of contracts, and provision of the limited set of public goods like roads, flood control projects, and money of stable value—are performed well, but the government does little else, a country’s rating on the EFW summary index will be high. Correspondingly, as government expenditures increase and regulations expand, a country’s rating will decline.\" In practice, the index measures: size of government (expenditures, taxes, and enterprises, legal structure), security of property rights, access to sound money, freedom to trade internationally, and regulation of credit, labor, and business. The report uses 42 distinct variables, from for example the World Bank, to measure this. Some examples: tax rates, degree of juridical independence, inflation rates, costs of importing, and regulated prices. Each of the 5 areas above is given equal weight in the final score.\n\nEconomic freedom has been shown to correlate strongly with higher average income per person, higher income of the poorest 10%, higher life expectancy, higher literacy, lower infant mortality, higher access to water sources and less corruption. The share of income in percent going to the poorest 10% is the same for both more and less economically free countries.\n\nThe people living in the top one-fifth of the most free countries enjoy an average income of $23,450 and a growth rate in the 1990s of 2.56 percent per year; in contrast, the bottom one-fifth in the rankings had an average income of just $2,556 and a -0.85 percent growth rate in the 1990s. The poorest 10 percent of the population have an average income of just $728 in the least free countries compared with over $7,000 in the most free countries. The life expectancy of people living in the most free nations is 20 years longer than for people in the least free countries.\n\nHigher economic freedom, as measured by both the Heritage and the Fraser indices, correlates strongly with higher self-reported happiness and is significant in preventing wars. Economic freedom is around 54 times more effective than democracy (as measured by \"Democracy Score\") in diminishing violent conﬂict.\n\nRegarding environmental health, studies have found no or a positive effect. More important may be the Kuznets curve. Most environmental health indicators, such as water and air pollution show an inverted U-shape. Meaning in the beginning of economic development, little weight is given to environmental concerns, raising pollution along with industrialization. After a threshold, when basic physical needs are met and a middle class is established, interest in a clean environment rises, reversing the trend.\n\nStudies show that more economic freedom is the cause of beneficial effects and that \"Economic Freedom of the World\" was used for most of the research, partly because \"Index of Economic Freedom\" only goes back to 1995 and because it uses more subjective variables.\n\nHundreds of peer-reviewed articles have used the index and it has been used in economic research, political science, and environmental research. The \"Economic Freedom of the World\" index has been more widely used than any other measure of economic freedom, because of its coverage of a longer time period. In 2016 the report was cited in 412 independent research journals. In 2016 and 2017 \"Free Malaysia Today\" and \"National Review\" quoted the report.\n\nThe correlation between economic freedom and growth has been criticized by studies. De Haan and Siermann find that the relationship is not robust. Heckelman and Stroup argue that the weighting procedure used in the construction of the index is arbitrary. They examine the components of the index individually and find that many—including a low top marginal tax rate—are negatively, rather than positively correlated with economic growth. A frequent criticism is that China, and other developing nations, have high growth rates but relatively low economic freedom. Developing nations can have higher growth rates than developed nations, as they have cheap labor and can import investment, technology and organizational skills from rich countries.\n\nWhen examining the subcomponents of the index, any positive effect that a low level of taxes might have is more disputed than the importance of rule of law, lack of political corruption, low inflation, and functioning property rights. Many north European nation, such as Iceland (# 70), Denmark (# 15), Finland (# 11) and Sweden (# 39), have extensive welfare states, which are strongly opposed by advocates of laissez-faire. It is argued these countries have less regulation than most others, and research using the Ease of Doing Business Index suggests that the effect of business regulations is more important than government consumption. The Global Competitiveness Report looks at several other factors that affect economic growth such as infrastructure, health, and education.\n\nAlthough the World Bank does not believe that laissez-faire policies, if they allow large inequalities of wealth to develop, are an effective way to achieve this goal, it is a strong supporter of the importance of economic growth for reducing poverty. It argues that an overview of many studies shows that: growth is fundamental for poverty reduction, and in principle growth as such does not seem to affect inequality, growth accompanied by a more egalitarian distribution of wealth is better than growth alone, high initial income inequality is a brake on poverty reduction, poverty itself is also likely to be a barrier for poverty reduction, and wealth inequality seems to predict lower future growth rates. In 2011 the \"IMF Economic Review\" published an article that found countries with higher economic freedom and more liberal credit market regulation suffered more in output growth during the late-2000s financial crisis. In 2014 a working paper published by the International Labour Organization said some of the methodology used in the Rigidity of Employment index sub-components, was not useful.\n\nThe \"Economic Freedom of the World 2005\" report stated that the world economic freedom score has grown considerably over the last few decades. By its measure, the average score has increased from 5.17 in 1985 to 6.4. Of the nations in 1985, 95 nations increased their score, seven saw a decline, and six were unchanged.\n\nEconomic Freedom Ratings for 2013, including 157 countries and 119 positions which may be shared by two or more countries.\n\nA related index for Chinese provinces is followed by both Chinese scholars and policy makers. There is also a network of institutions in 59 different nations that use the index to promote free market ideas.\n\n"}
{"id": "4946600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4946600", "title": "Fairy Flag", "text": "Fairy Flag\n\nThe Fairy Flag (Scottish Gaelic: \"Am Bratach Sìth\") is an heirloom of the chiefs of Clan MacLeod. It is held in Dunvegan Castle along with other notable heirlooms, such as the Dunvegan Cup and Sir Rory Mor's Horn. The Fairy Flag is known for the numerous traditions of fairies, and magical properties associated with it. The flag is made of silk, is yellow or brown in colour, and measures about squared. It has been examined numerous times in the last two centuries, and its condition has somewhat deteriorated. It is ripped and tattered, and is considered to be extremely fragile. The flag is covered in small red \"elf dots\". In the early part of the 19th century, the flag was also marked with small crosses, but these have since disappeared. The silk of the flag has been stated to have originated in the Far East, and was therefore extremely precious, which led some to believe that the flag may have been an important relic of some sort. Others have attempted to associate the flag with the Crusades or even a raven banner, which was said to have been used by various Viking leaders in the British Isles.\n\nThere are numerous traditions and stories associated with the flag, most of which deal with its magical properties and mysterious origins. The flag is said to have originated as: a gift from the fairies to an infant chieftain; a gift to a chief from a departing fairy-lover; a reward for defeating an evil spirit. The various powers attributed to the Fairy Flag include: the ability to multiply a clan's military forces; the ability to save the lives of certain clanfolk; the ability to cure a plague on cattle; the ability to increase the chances of fertility; and the ability to bring herring into the loch at Dunvegan. Some traditions relate that if the flag were to be unfurled and waved more than three times, it would either vanish, or lose its powers forever.\n\nClan tradition, preserved in the early 19th century, tells how the Fairy Flag was entrusted to a family of hereditary standard bearers. Only the eldest male of this family was ever allowed to unfurl the flag; the first such hereditary standard bearer was given the honour of being buried inside the tomb of the chiefs, on the sacred isle of Iona. Tradition states that the flag was unfurled at several clan battles in the 15th and 16th centuries; the flag's magical powers are said to have won at least one of them. Another 19th-century tradition linked the flag to a prophecy which foretold the downfall of Clan MacLeod; but it also prophesied that, in the \"far distant future\", the clan would regain its power and raise its honour higher than ever before. In the mid-20th century, the Fairy Flag was said to have extinguished a fire at Dunvegan Castle, and to have given luck to servicemen flying bombing missions in the Second World War.\n\nIn the 19th century, the writer Rev. Norman Macleod (1783–1862) recalled seeing the Fairy Flag during his childhood around 1799 (see relevant section below). He described the flag as then having crosses wrought in gold thread, and several \"elf spots\" stitched upon it. N. Macleod recollected that when the flag was examined, bits were taken off it from time to time; so much so, that later in his life he did not believe the flag still existed. In August 1814, Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle on the Isle of Skye, and wrote of the visit in his diary. One of several items he mentioned seeing was the Fairy Flag. Scott described it as \"a pennon of silk, with something like round red rowan-berries wrought upon it\". John Francis Campbell saw the flag in 1871, and described it as being \"made of yellow raw silk with figures and spots worked on it in red\". In 1927, Roderick Charles MacLeod described the flag as then being square and brown. He measured it as about squared. He considered the flag to have originally been much larger; and remarked on its extreme fragility and the requirement for careful handling, if it should be handled at all. R.C. MacLeod noted N. Macleod's description of the flag, but observed that it now only contained the \"elf spots\"—there was then no evidence of any crosses upon what remained of the flag. R.C. MacLeod also observed that several tears in the flag had been carefully mended.\n\nThe flag was examined in the early 20th century by A.J.B. Wace of the Victoria and Albert Museum, who concluded that the silk was woven in either Syria or Rhodes, and the darns were made in the Near East. It was his opinion that the flag, in its original state, would have been quite precious, possibly a relic like the shirt of a saint. The belief at the time of this examination was the MacLeods were descended from Harald Hardrada, who spent some time in Constantinople in the 11th century. In line with this belief, it was suggested that the flag may have passed from Harald Hardrada down to the eponymous ancestor of the clan—Leod. The MacLeod Estate Office (Dunvegan Castle) website claims that experts have dated the flag to the 4th and 7th centuries—hundreds of years before the Crusades. The flag is currently held in Dunvegan Castle, along with other notable heirlooms such as the Dunvegan Cup and Sir Rory Mor's Horn.\n\nIn 1772, Thomas Pennant made a tour of the Hebrides and later published an account of his travels. One of the things Pennant noted while visiting the Isle of Skye, was the Fairy Flag. According to Pennant, the flag was named \"\"Braolauch shi\", and was given to the MacLeods by Titania the \"Ben-shi\", wife of Oberon, king of the fairies. Titania blessed the flag with powers which would manifest when the flag was unfurled three times. On the third time, the flag and flag-bearer would be carried off by an invisible being, never to be seen again. The family of \"Clan y Faitter\"\" had the task of bearing the flag, and in return for their services, they possessed free lands in Bracadale. Pennant related how the flag had already been produced three times. The first occasion was in an unequal battle between the MacLeods and the Macdonalds of Clanranald. On the unfurling of the flag, the MacLeod forces were multiplied by ten. The second time the flag was unfurled to preserve the life of the lady of the clan, and thus saved the clan's heir. Pennant then declared that the flag was unfurled a third time to save his own life. He stated that the flag was by then so tattered that Titania did not seem to think it worth taking back. Pennant also noted the belief of the MacLeod's Norse ancestry and the magical raven banners said to have been used by the Vikings in the British Isles.\n\nMuch of the traditional history of the Fairy Flag is preserved in manuscript form. In the early part of the 20th century, Fred T. MacLeod noted one manuscript written around 1800, which he considered to be the most detailed description of the flag. Another source of the flag's traditional history is the \"Bannatyne manuscript\", which documents the traditional history of Clan MacLeod. It dates to the 1830s, however, it is thought to have been based upon earlier traditions.\n\nThe \"c.\"1800 manuscript stated that both the honour and the very existence of Clan MacLeod was thought to have depended upon the preservation of the Fairy Flag. Only the \"highest and purest blood of the race\" and the most renowned heroes, were selected to guard the flag when it was displayed. These twelve men, with a sword in hand, would stand just behind the chief who was always put in front. One family produced the hereditary keepers of the flag; and of this family, only the eldest living male could unfurl the flag. This family was called \"Clan Tormad Vic Vurichie\" (\"the children of Tormod, son of Murchadh\"), and was descended from \"Sìol Torcaill\". The 20th century Hebridean author Alasdair Alpin MacGregor, when writing of the traditions of the flag, stated that the flag's bearers held lands on Skye near Bracadale for their services to the chiefs of Clan MacLeod. The first of the flag bearers from this family was buried within the same grave as the chief of the clan, on the island of Iona. The second, and last bearer, was buried at St Clements Church, in Rodel, on the island of Harris. This man's remains were covered by a magnificent monument; the stone coffin in which his body was placed, was six feet deep. A moveable iron grate rested about two feet from the lid, and the man's body rested upon the grate. The man's male descendants were also deposited within this coffin. This meant that when a newly deceased was placed within, the bones and dust of the previous occupant were sifted through the grate into the coffin below. The writer of the manuscript stated that in the time of his own father, the last male of this family was interred this way. The tomb was then sealed by this man's daughter. The \"c.\"1800 manuscript also noted that this family, prior to its extinction, became miserably poor.\n\nThe \"Bannatyne manuscript\" states that the flag was unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay in 1480. The manuscript related that during the battle, the clan's chief, William Dubh (historically lived \"c.\"1415–1480), was slain, and in consequence his clan began to lose heart. A priest then ordered the flag's bearer, Murcha Breac, to unfurl the Fairy Flag to rally the clan. Up until this point, the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan were on the opposing side of their kinsmen, the MacLeods of Lewis. However, once the MacLeods of Lewis noticed that the flag had been unfurled, they switched sides to join forces with their kinsmen. Unfortunately for both MacLeod clans, the outcome of the battle had already been determined and they were on the losing side. Among the vast numbers of MacLeods slain were Murcha Breac and the twelve guardians of the flag. William Dubh is buried on the island of Iona with his predecessors, and the body of Murcha Breac is placed within the same tomb. The manuscript states that this was the greatest honour which could be bestowed upon his remains. R.C. MacLeod suggested that the MacLeod effigy within Iona Abbey may mark the burial of the first chiefs of the clan, as well as William Dubh, and the mentioned standard bearer. William Dubh is thought to have been the last MacLeod chief buried on Iona; his son, Alasdair Crotach (1450–1547), was buried in St Clements Church, on Harris.\n\nAccording to the \"Bannatyne manuscript\", the Fairy Flag was also unfurled during the Battle of Glendale, which the manuscript states to have been fought in about 1490. At one point during this conflict, both the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, and the MacLeods of Lewis were on the verge of giving way to the invading MacDonalds. Just at this moment, the mother of Alasdair Crotach, chief of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, ordered the Fairy Flag to be unfurled. The result was that both MacLeod clans renewed the battle with redoubled fury and, despite immense losses, eventually won the battle. Among the MacLeod dead was the flag bearer, Paul Dubh, who carried the Fairy Flag throughout the conflict until his death. The \"Bannatyne manuscript\" relates that Paul Dubh was honourably buried in a deep stone coffin, with a metal grate — much like the account given in the \"c.\"1800 manuscript. The writer of the \"Bannatyne manuscript\" states that each successive flag bearer was buried within this tomb, and that the writer's own grandfather saw the old ceremony performed for the last time, in the 18th century. The \"Bannatyne manuscript\" states that the tomb is located in the north-east corner of the chancel at St Clements Church, in Rodel. R.C. MacLeod noted that there was no trace of such a coffin or tomb; although, he suggested that it could have been buried or possibly built within a wall.\n\nThe \"c.\"1800 manuscript presented a legend of the Fairy Flag's origin. This legend concerned a MacLeod who went on a Crusade to the Holy Land. On his journey homewards, the MacLeod attempted to cross a dangerous mountainous pass on the borders of Palestine. Here, he met a hermit who gave him food and shelter. The hermit warned the MacLeod of a dangerous spirit that guards the pass, which had never failed to destroy a true believer. However, with the aid of a piece of the True Cross and certain directions from the hermit, the MacLeod is able to defeat the \"She Devil\"—who is called \"\"Nein a Phaipen\", or Daughter of Thunder\". In reward for conveying some secrets that the spirit wanted some friends to know, she revealed to the MacLeod \"the future destinies of the Clan\". The writer of the \"c.\"1800 manuscript stated that this knowledge was said to have been held by this man's family until its extinction. The spirit then gave the Macleod her girdle, telling him to convert it into a banner. The MacLeod then used his spear as a flag pole. The writer of the \"c.\"1800 manuscript stated that the spear was by then since lost, and that the secrets conveyed to MacLeod were lost forever. The writer also gave his own opinion on the origin of the Fairy Flag. The writer stated that the flag most probably originated as a banner used in the Holy Land, and that it was conveyed back home by the character portrayed in the legend.\n\nThe \"c.\"1800 manuscript related that the spell of the banner meant that it would vanish when it was displayed for the third time. The final unfurling of the banner would either gain the clan a complete victory over their enemies or meant that the clan was to suffer total extinction. The writer of the \"c.\"1800 manuscript went on to state that the temptation for unfurling the flag for the third and final time was always resisted; and that at the time of his writing, there was not much chance of it ever being unfurled again, since it was in such a reduced state. The writer stated that of the few shreds that remained, he himself possessed a fragment.\n\nThe \"c.\"1800 manuscript also stated that the flag was once held in an iron chest, within Dunvegan Castle. The key to the chest was then always in the possession of the hereditary flag bearers. The \"c.\"1800 manuscript related how, on the death of the MacLeod chief Tormod, son of lain Breac, the succession to the chiefship nearly fell to the family of the MacLeods of Talisker. The young widow of the last chief refused to give up Dunvegan Castle to the next heir, knowing herself to be pregnant (although she had only been married six weeks previous to her widowhood). In time, she gave birth to Tormod, the next chief. The \"c.\"1800 manuscript stated that at around this time, a man who wished to curry favour with the expectant heir (MacLeod of Talisker) attempted to steal the flag. Even though the Fairy Flag was later found, both the staff and iron chest were never seen again. Historically, the old chief, Tormod (son of Iain Breac), died in the autumn of 1706, and his son, Tormod, was born in July 1705.\n\nLate in his life, the writer Norman Macleod (1783–1862) related to one of his daughters of having heard an old Gaelic prophecy concerning the flag, and of events which took place in his childhood which were reported as examples of the prophecy being partially fulfilled. A summarised version of this prophecy was published in the late 19th century, within an account of the life of one of his sons. Soon after, in 1878, Alexander Mackenzie proposed that the prophecy as dictated by N. Macleod, may have been a fragmented remembrance of one of the prophecies of Coinneach Odhar (who is popularly known as the Brahan Seer). N. Macleod's tale of the prophecy is as follows:\n\nN. Macleod then related how as a child, he had been close to an English smith employed at Dunvegan. One day the smith told him in secrecy that the chest in which the flag was held was to be forced open the next morning, and that it had been arranged by Hector Macdonald Buchanan that the smith would be at the castle with the necessary tools. N. Macleod then asked Buchanan for permission to be present, and was granted leave on the condition that he not tell anyone—especially the chief—what was about to be done. The next morning the chest was forced open and the flag was found to be held within a wooden case. N. Macleod described the flag then as being a square-shaped piece of cloth with crosses wrought on it with gold thread, and several \"elf spots\" stitched onto it. After the flag had been examined, it was placed back into its case. N. Macleod stated that at around this time it was learned that the heir to the chiefship, Norman, was killed at sea. , on which he was a lieutenant, caught fire and exploded at sea killing 673 officers and men. N. Macleod stated that at about the same time, MacLeod's Maidens were sold to Campbell of Ensay. He also stated that he personally saw a fox with cubs, which lived in the west turret of the castle. N. Macleod related how he was grateful that the worst part of the prophecy remained unfulfilled; and that the chiefly family still owned their ancestral lands.\n\nR.C. MacLeod, who wrote in the early 20th century, considered that this prophecy seemed to have been fulfilled. At that time, the Macleod chief had no gentlemen of his clan as tenants on his estate; also, an heir to the family—named \"Ian Breac\"—was killed in the First World War. R.C. MacLeod noted that the prophecy stated that a \"John Breac\" (Gaelic: \"Iain Breac\", \"Iain the speckled\") would restore the fortunes of the family. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that this may still happen, when he lamented the loss of his son, stating that Iain Breac \"showed that his race had not lost the loyalty and courage which were their chief claims to glory in ancient days\".\n\nWhen Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle in 1814, he learned of several traditional tales relating to the area and the clan. He was told that the Fairy Flag had three magical properties. The first was that it multiplied the number of men upon a battlefield. The second was that when it was spread upon a nuptial bed, it ensured fertility. The third was that it brought herring into the loch.\n\nIn the early 20th century, R.C. MacLeod noted several traditions concerning the flag. One told how the flag came into the possession of the MacLeods through a fairy. A similar tradition relates of a fairy-lullaby.\n\nThe first of these traditions related by R.C. MacLeod tells how one of the chiefs of Clan MacLeod married a fairy; however, after twenty years she is forced to leave him and return to fairyland. She bade farewell to the chief at the Fairy Bridge (which stands about from Dunvegan) and gave him the flag. She promised that if it was waved in times of danger and distress, help would be given on three occasions. A similar tradition, related by John Arnott MacCulloch, stated that although the fairy's gift had the power to save both her husband and his clan, afterwards an invisible being would come to take both the flag and its bearer away—never to be seen again.\nR.C. MacLeod considered the above 'fairy lover' tradition to be connected to another about a lullaby. This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan bard in the last half of the 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several old women in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The nursemaid, who was within the room as well, was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him a lullaby. This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to whom this lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan. An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the \"right\".\n\nAnother tradition, related by R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events which took place after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious to join in the festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies appeared and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.\n\nR.C. MacLeod listed another tradition, somewhat similar to the one that appeared in \"c.\"1800 manuscript. According to this version, a MacLeod joined a Crusading army, and went to the Holy Land. While in the desert-wilderness, he came across a witch, from whom he managed to escape. He then came upon a river, and proceeded to cross it at a ford. However, a fairy maiden appeared from the water and blocked his passage. After a struggle, MacLeod overcame the fairy and passed over the river. He then became friends with her. Before they parted, the fairy maiden gave him a box of scented wood; this box, she told him, held several other smaller boxes, which fitted inside one another. She told him that the innermost box contained a magic banner, which when waved would bring forth a host of armed men to aid its owner. The fairy warned the MacLeod, that if he were to open the box within a year and a day from then, that no crops would grow on his land, no livestock would be born, as well as no children. When the MacLeod returned home he gave the box to the chief's wife. The wife, however, ignored the MacLeod's warning, and opened the box. Immediately a host of armed men appeared and that year, no children were born. The tradition concluded that ever since that time, the flag had been preserved for a time when such an army might mean salvation for the clan.\n\nR.C. MacLeod wrote of another tradition which stated that the flag was waved at a battle in Waternish, in about 1580; and of another which told of how it was waved during a time when a cattle plague was raging, and that it stopped the murrain. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had been waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.\nIn 1938, a fire broke out in a wing of Dunvegan Castle, and according to Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk, the flames were checked and extinguished when the flag was carried past to safety. During the Second World War, the chief of the clan, Dame Flora MacLeod of MacLeod, received a letter from a member of the clan who attributed his luck during bombing missions over Germany to a photo of the flag which he carried in his pocket.\n"}
{"id": "78470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78470", "title": "Giants (Greek mythology)", "text": "Giants (Greek mythology)\n\nIn Greek and Roman Mythology, the Giants, also called Gigantes (\"jye-GAHN-tees\" or \"gee-GAHN-tees\"; Greek: Γίγαντες, \"Gígantes\", Γίγας, \"Gígas\") were a race of great strength and aggression, though not necessarily of great size, known for the Gigantomachy (Gigantomachia), their battle with the Olympian gods. According to Hesiod, the Giants were the offspring of Gaia (Earth), born from the blood that fell when Uranus (Sky) was castrated by his Titan son Cronus.\n\nArchaic and Classical representations show Gigantes as man-sized hoplites (heavily armed ancient Greek foot soldiers) fully human in form. Later representations (after c. 380 BC) show Gigantes with snakes for legs. In later traditions, the Giants were often confused with other opponents of the Olympians, particularly the Titans, an earlier generation of large and powerful children of Gaia and Uranus.\n\nThe vanquished Giants were said to be buried under volcanoes and to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.\n\nThe name \"Gigantes\" is usually taken to imply \"earth-born\", and Hesiod's \"Theogony\" makes this explicit by having the Giants be the offspring of Gaia (Earth). According to Hesiod, Gaia, mating with Uranus, bore many children: the first generation of Titans, the Cyclops and the Hundred-Handers. But Uranus hated his children and, as soon as they were born, he imprisoned them inside of Gaia, causing her much distress. And so Gaia made a sickle of adamant which she gave to Cronus, the youngest of her Titan sons, and hid him (presumably still inside Gaia's body) to wait in ambush. And when Uranus came to lie with Gaia, Cronus castrated his father, and \"the bloody drops that gushed forth [Gaia] received, and as the seasons moved round she bore ... the great Giants.\" From these same drops of blood also came the Erinyes (Furies) and the Meliai (ash tree nymphs), while the severed genitals of Uranus falling into the sea resulted in a white foam from which Aphrodite grew. The mythographer Apollodorus also has the Giants being the offspring of Gaia and Uranus, though he makes no connection with Uranus' castration, saying simply that Gaia \"vexed on account of the Titans, brought forth the Giants\".\n\nThere are three brief references to the \"Gigantes\" in Homer's \"Odyssey\", though it's not entirely clear that Homer and Hesiod understood the term to mean the same thing. Homer has Giants among the ancestors of the Phaiakians, a race of men encountered by Odysseus, their ruler Alcinous being the son of Nausithous, who was the son of Poseidon and Periboea, the daughter of the Giant king Eurymedon. Elsewhere in the \"Odyssey\", Alcinous says that the Phaiakians, like the Cyclopes and the Giants, are \"near kin\" to the gods. Odysseus describes the Laestrygonians (another race encountered by Odysseus in his travels) as more like Giants than men. Pausanias, the 2nd century AD geographer, read these lines of the \"Odyssey\" to mean that, for Homer, the Giants were a race of mortal men.\n\nThe 6th–5th century BC lyric poet Bacchylides calls the Giants \"sons of the Earth\". Later the term \"gegeneis\" (\"earthborn\") became a common epithet of the Giants. The first century Latin writer Hyginus has the Giants being the offspring of Gaia and Tartarus, another primordial Greek deity.\n\nThough distinct in early traditions, Hellenistic and later writers often confused or conflated the Giants and their Gigantomachy, with an earlier set of offspring of Gaia and Uranus, the Titans and their war with the Olympian gods, the Titanomachy. This confusion extended to other opponents of the Olympians, including the huge monster Typhon, the offspring of Gaia and Tartarus, whom Zeus finally defeated with his thunderbolt, and the Aloadae, the large, strong and aggressive brothers Otus and Ephialtes, who piled Pelion on top of Ossa in order to scale the heavens and attack the Olympians (though in the case of Ephialtes there was probably a Giant with the same name). For example, Hyginus includes the names of three Titans: Coeus, Iapetus, and Astraeus, along with Typhon and the Aloadae, in his list of Giants, and Ovid, seems to conflate the Gigantomachy with the later siege of Olympus by the Aloadae.\n\nHomer describes the Giant king Eurymedon as \"great-hearted\" (\"μεγαλήτορος\"), and his people as \"insolent\" (\"ὑπερθύμοισι\") and \"froward\" (\"ἀτάσθαλος\"). Hesiod calls the Giants \"strong\" (\"κρατερῶν\") and \"great\" (\"μεγάλους\") which may or may not be a reference to their size. Though a possible later addition, the \"Theogony\" also has the Giants born \"with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands\".\n\nOther early sources characterize the Giants by their excesses. Pindar describes the excessive violence of the Giant Porphyrion as having provoked \"beyond all measure\". Bacchylides calls the Giants arrogant, saying that they were destroyed by \"Hybris\" (the Greek word hubris personified). The earlier seventh century BC poet Alcman perhaps had already used the Giants as an example of hubris, with the phrases \"vengeance of the gods\" and \"they suffered unforgettable punishments for the evil they did\" being possible references to the Gigantomachy.\n\nHomer's comparison of the Giants to the Laestrygonians is suggestive of similarities between the two races. The Laestrygonians, who \"hurled ... rocks huge as a man could lift\", certainly possessed great strength, and possibly great size, as their king's wife is described as being as big as a mountain.\n\nOver time, descriptions of the Giants make them less human, more monstrous and more \"gigantic\". According to Apollodorus the Giants had great size and strength, a frightening appearance, with long hair and beards and scaly feet. Ovid makes them \"serpent-footed\" with a \"hundred arms\", and Nonnus has them \"serpent-haired\".\n\nThe most important divine struggle in Greek mythology was the Gigantomachy, the battle fought between the Giants and the Olympian gods for supremacy of the cosmos. It is primarily for this battle that the Giants are known, and its importance to Greek culture is attested by the frequent depiction of the Gigantomachy in Greek art.\n\nThe references to the Gigantomachy in archaic sources are sparse. Neither Homer nor Hesiod mention anything about the Giants battling the gods.\nHomer's remark that Eurymedon \"brought destruction on his froward people\" might possibly be a reference to the Gigantomachy and Hesiod's remark that Heracles performed a \"great work among the immortals\" is probably a reference to Heracles' crucial role in the gods' victory over the Giants. The Hesiodic \"Catalogue of Women\" (or the \"Ehoia\") following mentions of his sacks of Troy and of Kos, refers to Heracles having slain \"presumptious Giants\". Another probable reference to the Gigantomachy in the \"Catalogue\" has Zeus produce Heracles to be \"a protector against ruin for gods and men\".\n\nThere are indications that there might have been a lost epic poem, a \"Gigantomachia\", which gave an account of the war: Hesiod's \"Theogony\" says that the Muses sing of the Giants, and the sixth century BC poet Xenophanes mentions the Gigantomachy as a subject to be avoided at table. The Apollonius scholia refers to a \"Gigantomachia\" in which the Titan Cronus (as a horse) sires the centaur Chiron by mating with Philyra (the daughter of two Titans), but the scholiast may be confusing the Titans and Giants. Other possible archaic sources include the lyric poets Alcman (mentioned above) and the sixth-century Ibycus.\n\nThe late sixth early fifth century BC lyric poet Pindar provides some of the earliest details of the battle between the Giants and the Olympians. He locates it \"on the plain of Phlegra\" and has Teiresias foretell Heracles killing Giants \"beneath [his] rushing arrows\". He calls Heracles \"you who subdued the Giants\", and has Porphyrion, who he calls \"the king of the Giants\", being overcome by the bow of Apollo. Euripides' \"Heracles\" has its hero shooting Giants with arrows, and his \"Ion\" has the chorus describe seeing a depiction of the Gigantomachy on the late sixth century Temple of Apollo at Delphi, with Athena fighting the Giant Enceladus with her \"gorgon shield\", Zeus burning the Giant Mimas with his \"mighty thunderbolt, blazing at both ends\", and Dionysus killing an unnamed Giant with his \"ivy staff\".\n\nThe most detailed account of the Gigantomachy is that of the (first century or second century AD) mythographer Apollodorus. None of the early sources give any reasons for the war. Scholia to the \"Iliad\" mention the rape of Hera by the Giant Eurymedon and according to scholia to Pindar's \"Isthmian\" 6, it was the theft of the cattle of Helios by the Giant Alcyoneus that started the war. Apollodorus, who also mentions the theft of Helios' cattle by Alcyoneus, suggests a mother's revenge as the motive for the war, saying that Gaia bore the Giants because of her anger over the Titans (who had been vanquished and imprisoned by the Olympians). Seemingly, as soon as the Giants are born they begin hurling \"rocks and burning oaks at the sky\".\n\nThere was a prophecy that the Giants could not be killed by the gods alone, but they could be killed with the help of a mortal. Hearing this, Gaia sought for a certain plant (\"pharmakon\") that would protect the Giants. Before Gaia or anyone else could find this plant, Zeus forbade Eos (Dawn), Selene (Moon) and Helios (Sun) to shine, harvested all of the plant himself and then he had Athena summon Heracles.\n\nAccording to Apollodorus, Alcyoneus and Porphyrion were the two strongest Giants. Heracles shot Alcyoneus, who fell to the ground but then revived, for Alcyoneus was immortal within his native land. So Heracles, with Athena's advice, dragged him beyond the borders of that land, where Alcyoneus then died (compare with Antaeus). Porphyrion attacked Heracles and Hera, but Zeus caused Porphyrion to become enamoured of Hera, whom Porphyrion then tried to rape, but Zeus struck Porphyrion with his thunderbolt and Heracles killed him with an arrow.\n\nOther Giants and their fates are mentioned by Apollodorus. Ephialtes was blinded by an arrow from Apollo in his left eye, and another arrow from Heracles in his right. Eurytus was killed by Dionysus with his thyrsus, Clytius by Hecate with her torches and Mimas by Hephaestus with \"missiles of red-hot metal\" from his forge. Athena crushed Enceladus under the Island of Sicily and flayed Pallas, using his skin as a shield. Poseidon broke off a piece of the island of Kos called Nisyros, and threw it on top of Polybotes (Strabo also relates the story of Polybotes buried under Nisyros but adds that some say Polybotes lies under Kos instead). Hermes, wearing Hades' helmet, killed Hippolytus, Artemis killed Gration, and the Moirai (Fates) killed Agrius and Thoas with bronze clubs. The rest of the giants were \"destroyed\" by thunderbolts thrown by Zeus, with each Giant being shot with arrows by Heracles (as the prophecy seemingly required).\n\nThe Latin poet Ovid gives a brief account of the Gigantomachy in his poem \"Metamorphoses\". Ovid, apparently including the Aloadae's attack upon Olympus as part of the Gigantomachy, has the Giants attempt to seize \"the throne of Heaven\" by piling \"mountain on mountain to the lofty stars\" but Jove (i.e. Jupiter, the Roman Zeus) overwhelms the Giants with his thunderbolts, overturning \"from Ossa huge, enormous Pelion\". Ovid tells that (as \"fame reports\") from the blood of the Giants came a new race of beings in human form. According to Ovid, Earth [Gaia] did not want the Giants to perish without a trace, so \"reeking with the copious blood of her gigantic sons\", she gave life to the \"steaming gore\" of the blood soaked battleground. These new offspring, like their fathers the Giants, also hated the gods and possessed a bloodthirsty desire for \"savage slaughter\".\n\nLater in the \"Metamorphoses\", Ovid refers to the Gigantomachy as \"the time when serpent footed giants strove / to fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven\". Here Ovid apparently conflates the Giants with the Hundred-Handers, who, though in Hesiod fought alongside Zeus and the Olympians, in some traditions fought against them.\n\nVarious places have been associated with the Giants and the Gigantomachy. As noted above Pindar has the battle occur at Phlegra (\"the place of burning\"), as do other early sources. Phlegra was said to be an ancient name for Pallene (modern Kassandra) and Phlegra/Pallene was the usual birthplace of the Giants and site of the battle. Apollodorus, who placed the battle at Pallene, says the Giants were born \"as some say, in Phlegrae, but according to others in Pallene\". The name Phlegra and the Gigantomachy were also often associated, by later writers, with a volcanic plain in Italy, west of Naples and east of Cumae, called the Phlegraean Fields. The third century BC poet Lycophron, apparently locates a battle of gods and Giants in the vicinity of the volcanic island of Ischia, the largest of the Phlegraean Islands off the coast of Naples, where he says the Giants (along with Typhon) were \"crushed\" under the island. At least one tradition placed Phlegra in Thessaly.\n\nAccording to the geographer Pausanias, the Arcadians claimed that battle took place \"not at Pellene in Thrace\" but in the plain of Megalopolis where \"rises up fire\". Another tradition apparently placed the battle at Tartessus in Spain. Diodorus Siculus presents a war with multiple battles, with one at Pallene, one on the Phlegraean Fields, and one on Crete. Strabo mentions an account of Heracles battling Giants at Phanagoria, a Greek colony on the shores of the Black Sea. Even when, as in Apollodorus, the battle starts at one place. Individual battles between a Giant and a god might range farther afield, with Enceladus buried beneath Sicily, and Polybotes under the island of Nisyros (or Kos). Other locales associated with Giants include Attica, Corinth, Cyzicus, Lipara, Lycia, Lydia, Miletus, and Rhodes.\n\nThe presence of volcanic phenomena, and the frequent unearthing of the fossilized bones of large prehistoric animals throughout these locations may explain why such sites became associated with the Giants.\n\nFrom the sixth century BC onwards, the Gigantomachy was a popular and important theme in Greek art, with over six hundred representations cataloged in the \"Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae\" (\"LIMC\").\n\nThe Gigantomachy was depicted on the new \"peplos\" (robe) presented to Athena on the Acropolis of Athens as part of the Panathenaic festival celebrating her victory over the Giants, a practice dating from perhaps as early as the second millennium BC. The earliest extant indisputable representations of Gigantes are found on votive pinakes from Corinth and Eleusis, and Attic black-figure pots, dating from the second quarter of the sixth century BC (this excludes early depictions of Zeus battling single snake-footed creatures, which probably represent his battle with Typhon, as well as Zeus' opponent on the west pediment of the Temple of Artemis on Kerkyra (modern Corfu) which is probably not a Giant).\n\nThough all these early Attic vases are fragmentary, the many common features in their depictions of the Gigantomachy suggest that a common model or template was used as a prototype, possibly Athena's \"peplos\". These vases depict large battles, including most of the Olympians, and contain a central group which appears to consist of Zeus, Heracles, Athena, and sometimes Gaia. Zeus, Heracles and Athena are attacking Giants to the right. Zeus mounts a chariot brandishing his thunderbolt in his right hand, Heracles, in the chariot, bends forward with drawn bow and left foot on the chariot pole, Athena, beside the chariot, strides forward toward one or two Giants, and the four chariot horses trample a fallen Giant. When present, Gaia is shielded behind Herakles, apparently pleading with Zeus to spare her children.\n\nOn either side of the central group are the rest of the gods engaged in combat with particular Giants. While the gods can be identified by characteristic features, for example Hermes with his hat (\"petasos\") and Dionysus his ivy crown, the Giants are not individually characterized and can only be identified by inscriptions which sometimes name the Giant. The fragments of one vase from this same period (Getty 81.AE.211) name five Giants: Pankrates against Heracles, Polybotes against Zeus, Oranion against Dionysus, Euboios and Euphorbos fallen and Ephialtes. Also named, on two other of these early vases, are Aristaeus battling Hephaestus (Akropolis 607), Eurymedon and (again) Ephialtes (Akropolis 2134). An amphora from Caere from later in the sixth century, gives the names of more Giants: Hyperbios and Agasthenes (along with Ephialtes) fighting Zeus, Harpolykos against Hera, Enceladus against Athena and (again) Polybotes, who in this case battles Poseidon with his trident holding the island of Nisyros on his shoulder (Louvre E732). This motif of Poseidon holding the island of Nisyros, ready to hurl it at his opponent, is another frequent feature of these early Gigantomachies.\n\nThe Gigantomachy was also a popular theme in late sixth century sculpture. The most comprehensive treatment is found on the north frieze of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi (c. 525 BC), with more than thirty figures, named by inscription. From left to right, these include Hephaestus (with bellows), two females fighting two Giants; Dionysus striding toward an advancing Giant; Themis in a chariot drawn by a team of lions which are attacking a fleeing Giant; the archers Apollo and Artemis; another fleeing Giant (Tharos or possibly Kantharos); the Giant Ephialtes lying on the ground; and a group of three Giants, which include Hyperphas and Alektos, opposing Apollo and Artemis. Next comes a missing central section presumably containing Zeus, and possibly Heracles, with chariot (only parts of a team of horses remain). To the right of this comes a female stabbing her spear at a fallen Giant (probably Porphyrion); Athena fighting Eriktypos and a second Giant; a male stepping over the fallen Astarias to attack Biatas and another Giant; and Hermes against two Giants. Then follows a gap which probably contained Poseidon and finally, on the far right, a male fighting two Giants, one fallen, the other the Giant Mimon (possibly the same as the Giant Mimas mentioned by Apollodorus).\n\nThe Gigantomachy also appeared on several other late sixth century buildings, including the west pediment of the Alkmeonid Temple of Apollo at Delphi, the pediment of the Megarian Treasury at Olympia, the east pediment of the Old Temple of Athena on the Acropolis of Athens, and the metopes of Temple F at Selinous.\n\nThe theme continued to be popular in the fifth century BC. A particularly fine example is found on a red-figure cup (c. 490–485 BC) by the Brygos Painter (Berlin F2293). On one side of the cup is the same central group of gods (minus Gaia) as described above: Zeus wielding his thunderbolt, stepping into a quadriga, Heracles with lion skin (behind the chariot rather than on it) drawing his (unseen) bow and, ahead, Athena thrusting her spear into a fallen Giant. On the other side are Hephaestus flinging flaming missiles of red-hot metal from two pairs of tongs, Poseidon, with Nisyros on his shoulder, stabbing a fallen Giant with his trident and Hermes with his \"petasos\" hanging in back of his head, attacking another fallen Giant. None of the Giants are named.\n\nPhidias used the theme for the metopes of the east façade of the Parthenon (c. 445 BC) and for the interior of the shield of Athena Parthenos. Phidias' work perhaps marks the beginning of a change in the way the Giants are presented. While previously the Giants had been portrayed as typical hoplite warriors armed with the usual helmets, shields, spears and swords, in the fifth century the Giants begin to be depicted as less handsome in appearance, primitive and wild, clothed in animal skins or naked, often without armor and using boulders as weapons. A series of red-figure pots from c. 400 BC, which may have used Phidas' shield of Athena Parthenos as their model, show the Olympians fighting from above and the Giants fighting with large stones from below.\n\nWith the beginning of the fourth century BC probably comes the first portrayal of the Giants in Greek art as anything other than fully human in form, with legs that become coiled serpents having snake heads at the ends in place of feet. Such depictions were perhaps borrowed from Typhon, the monstrous son of Gaia and Tartarus, described by Hesiod as having a hundred snake heads growing from his shoulders. This snake-legged motif becomes the standard for the rest of antiquity, culminating in the monumental Gigantomachy frieze of the second century BC Pergamon Altar. Measuring nearly 400 feet long and over seven feet high, here the Gigantomachy receives its most extensive treatment, with over one hundred figures.\n\nAlthough fragmentary, much of the Gigantomachy frieze has been restored. The general sequence of the figures and the identifications of most of the approximately sixty gods and goddesses have been more or less established. The names and positions of most Giants remain uncertain. Some of the names of the Giants have been determined by inscription, while their positions are often conjectured on the basis of which gods fought which Giants in Apollodorus' account.\n\nThe same central group of Zeus, Athena, Heracles and Gaia, found on many early Attic vases, also featured prominently on the Pergamon Altar. On the right side of the East frieze, the first encountered by a visitor, a winged Giant, usually identified as Alcyoneus, fights Athena. Below and to the right of Athena, Gaia rises from the ground, touching Athena's robe in supplication. Flying above Gaia, a winged Nike crowns the victorious Athena. To the left of this grouping a snake-legged Porphyrion battles Zeus and to the left of Zeus is Heracles.\n\nOn the far left side of the East frieze, a triple Hecate with torch battles a snake-legged Giant usually identified (following Apollodorus) as Clytius. To the right lays the fallen Udaeus, shot in his left eye by an arrow from Apollo, along with Demeter who wields a pair of torches against Erysichthon.\n\nThe Giants are depicted in a variety of ways. Some Giants are fully human in form, while others are a combination of human and animal forms. Some are snake-legged, some have wings, one has bird claws, one is lion-headed, and another is bull-headed. Some Giants wear helmets, carry shields and fight with swords. Others are naked or clothed in animal skins and fight with clubs or rocks.\n\nThe large size of the frieze probably necessitated the addition of many more Giants than had been previously known. Some, like Typhon and Tityus, who were not strictly speaking Giants, were perhaps included. Others were probably invented. The partial inscription \"Mim\" may mean that the Giant Mimas was also depicted. Other less familiar or otherwise unknown Giant names include Allektos, Chthonophylos, Eurybias, Molodros, Obrimos, Ochthaios and Olyktor.\n\nThe subject was revived in the Renaissance, most famously in the frescos of the \"Sala dei Giganti\" in the Palazzo del Te, Mantua. These were painted around 1530 by Giulio Romano and his workshop, and aimed to give the viewer the unsettling idea that the large hall was in the process of collapsing. The subject was also popular in Northern Mannerism around 1600, especially among the Haarlem Mannerists, and continued to be painted into the 18th century.\n\nHistorically, the myth of the Gigantomachy (as well as the Titanomachy) may reflect the \"triumph\" of the new imported gods of the invading Greek speaking peoples from the north (c. 2000 BC) over the old gods of the existing peoples of the Greek peninsula. For the Greeks, the Gigantomachy represented a victory for order over chaos—the victory of the divine order and rationalism of the Olympian gods over the discord and excessive violence of the earth-born chthonic Giants. More specifically, for sixth and fifth century BC Greeks, it represented a victory for civilization over barbarism, and as such was used by Phidias on the metopes of the Parthenon and the shield of \"Athena Parthenos\" to symbolize the victory of the Athenians over the Persians. Later the Attalids similarly used the Gigantomachy on the Pergamon Altar to symbolize their victory over the Galatians of Asia Minor.\n\nThe attempt of the Giants to overthrow the Olympians also represented the ultimate example of hubris, with the gods themselves punishing the Giants for their arrogant challenge to the gods' divine authority. The Gigantomachy can also be seen as a continuation of the struggle between Gaia (Mother Earth) and Uranus (Father Sky), and thus as part of the primal opposition between female and male. Plato compares the Gigantomachy to a philosophical dispute about existence, wherein the materialist philosophers, who believe that only physical things exist, like the Giants, wish to \"drag down everything from heaven and the invisible to earth\".\n\nIn Latin literature, in which the Giants, the Titans, Typhon and the Aloadae are all often conflated, Gigantomachy imagery is a frequent occurrence. Cicero, while urging the acceptance of aging and death as natural and inevitable, allegorizes the Gigantomachy as \"fighting against Nature\". The rationalist Epicurean poet Lucretius, for whom such things as lightning, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions had natural rather than divine causes, used the Gigantomachy to celebrate the victory of philosophy over mythology and superstition. In the triumph of science and reason over traditional religious belief, the Gigantomachy symbolized for him Epicurus storming heaven. In a reversal of their usual meaning, he represents the Giants as heroic rebels against the tyranny of Olympus. Virgil—reversing Lucretius' reversal—restores the conventional meaning, making the Giants once again enemies of order and civilization. Horace makes use of this same meaning to symbolize the victory of Augustus at the Battle of Actium as a victory for the civilized West over the barbaric East.\n\nOvid, in his \"Metamorphoses\", describes mankind's moral decline through the ages of gold, silver, bronze and iron, and presents the Gigantomachy as a part of that same descent from natural order into chaos. Lucan, in his \"Pharsalia\", which contains many Gigantomachy references, makes the Gorgon's gaze turn the Giants into mountains. Valerius Flaccus, in his \"Argonautica\", makes frequent use of Gigantomachy imagery, with the Argo (the world's first ship) constituting a Gigantomachy-like offense against natural law, and example of hubristic excess.\n\nClaudian, the fourth-century AD court poet of emperor Honorius, composed a \"Gigantomachia\" that viewed the battle as a metaphor for vast geomorphic change: \"The puissant company of the giants confounds all differences between things; islands abandon the deep; mountains lie hidden in the sea. Many a river is left dry or has altered its ancient course...robbed of her mountains Earth sank into level plains, parted among her own sons.\"\n\nVarious locations associated with the Giants and the Gigantomachy were areas of volcanic and seismic activity (e.g. the Phlegraean Fields west of Naples), and the vanquished Gigantes (along with other \"giants\") were said to be buried under volcanos. Their subterranean movements were said to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.\n\nThe Giant Enceladus was thought to lay buried under Mount Etna, the volcano's eruptions being the breath of Enceladus, and its tremors caused by the Giant rolling over from side to side beneath the mountain (the monster Typhon and the Hundred-hander Briareus were also said to be buried under Etna). The Giant Alcyoneus along with \"many giants\" were said to lie under Mount Vesuvius, \"Prochyte\" (modern Procida), one of the volcanic Phlegraean Islands was supposed to sit atop the Giant Mimas, and Polybotes was said to lie pinned beneath the volcanic island of Nisyros, supposedly a piece of the island of Kos broken off and thrown by Poseidon.\n\nDescribing the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which buried the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum, Cassius Dio relates accounts of the appearance of many Giant-like creatures on the mountain and in the surrounding area followed by violent earthquakes and the final cataclysmic eruption, saying \"some thought that the Giants were rising again in revolt (for at this time also many of their forms could be discerned in the smoke and, moreover, a sound as of trumpets was heard)\".\n\nNames for the Giants can be found in ancient literary sources and inscriptions. Vian and Moore provide a list with over seventy entries, some of which are based upon inscriptions which are only partially preserved. Some of the Giants identified by name are:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first edition contained 86 stories, and by the seventh edition in 1857, had 211 unique fairy tales.\n\nJacob and Wilhelm Grimm were two of nine children from their mother Dorothea (Née Zimmer) and father Philipp Wilhelm Grimm. Philipp was a highly regarded district magistrate in Steinau, near Kassel. Jacob and Wilhelm were sent to school for a classical education once they were of age, while their father was working. They were very hard-working pupils throughout their education. They followed their father’s footsteps and started to pursue a degree in law. However, in 1796, their father died at the age of 44 from pneumonia. This was a tragic time for the Grimms because the family lost all financial support and relied on their aunt, Henriette Zimmer, and grandfather, Johanne Hermann Zimmer. At the age of 11, Jacob was compelled to be head of the household and provide for his family. After down-sizing their home because of financial reasons, Henriette sent Jacob and Wilhelm to study at the prestigious high school, Lyzeum, in Kassel. In school, their grandfather wrote to them saying that because of their current situation, they needed to apply themselves industriously to secure their future welfare.\n\nShortly after attending Lyzeum, their grandfather died and they were again left to themselves to support their family in the future. The two became intent on becoming the best students at Lyzeum, since they wanted to live up to their deceased father. They studied more than twelve hours a day and established similar work habits. They also shared the same bed and room at school. After four years of rigorous schooling, Jacob graduated head of his class in 1802. Wilhelm contracted asthma and scarlet fever, which delayed his graduation by one year although he was also head of his class. Both were given special dispensations for studying law at the University of Marburg. They particularly needed this dispensation because their social standing at the time was not high enough to have normal admittance. University of Marburg was a small, 200-person university where most students were more interested in activities than schooling. Most of the students received stipends even though they were the richest in the state. The Grimms did not receive any stipends because of their social standing; however, they were not upset by it since it kept the distractions away.\n\nJacob attended the university first and showed proof of his hard work ethic and quick intelligence. Wilhelm joined Jacob at the university, and Jacob drew the attention of Professor Friedrich Carl von Savigny, founder of its historical school of law. He became a huge personal and professional influence on the brothers. Throughout their time at university, the brothers became quite close with Savigny and were able to use his personal library as they became very interested in German law, history, and folklore. Savigny asked Jacob to join him in Paris as an assistant and Jacob went with him for a year. While he was gone, Wilhelm became very interested in German literature and started collecting books. Once Jacob returned to Kassel in 1806, he decided to quit studying law and instead spent his full efforts on German literature. While Jacob studied literature and took care of their siblings, Wilhelm received his degree in law at Marburg. During the Napoleonic Wars, Jacob interrupted his studies to serve the Hessian War Commission.\n\nIn 1808, their mother died and it was hard on Jacob because he took the position in the family as a father figure, while also trying to be a brother. From 1806 to 1810, the Grimm family had barely enough money to properly feed and clothe themselves. During this time, Jacob and Wilhelm were concerned about the stability of the family.\n\nAchim von Arnim and Clemens Brentano were good friends of the brothers and wanted to publish folk tales, so they asked the brothers to collect oral tales for publication. The Grimms collected many old books and asked friends and acquaintances in Kassel to tell tales and to gather stories from others. Jacob and Wilhelm sought to collect these stories in order to write a history of old German Poesie and to preserve history.\n\nThe first volume of the first edition was published in 1812, containing 86 stories; the second volume of 70 stories followed in 1815. For the second edition, two volumes were issued in 1819 and a third in 1822, totaling 170 tales. The third edition appeared in 1837; fourth edition, 1840; fifth edition, 1843; sixth edition, 1850; seventh edition, 1857. Stories were added, and also subtracted, from one edition to the next, until the seventh held 211 tales. All editions were extensively illustrated, first by Philipp Grot Johann and, after his death in 1892, by German illustrator Robert Leinweber.\n\nThe first volumes were much criticized because, although they were called \"Children's Tales\", they were not regarded as suitable for children, both for the scholarly information included and the subject matter. Many changes through the editions – such as turning the wicked mother of the first edition in \"Snow White\" and \"Hansel and Gretel\" (shown in original Grimm stories as Hänsel and Grethel) to a stepmother, were probably made with an eye to such suitability. Jack Zipes believes that the Grimms made the change in later editions because they “held motherhood sacred”.\n\nThey removed sexual references—such as Rapunzel's innocently asking why her dress was getting tight around her belly, and thus naively revealing to the witch Dame Gothel her pregnancy and the prince's visits—but, in many respects, violence, particularly when punishing villains, was increased.\n\nThe brothers' initial intention of their first book, Children’s and Household Tales, was to establish a name for themselves in the world. After the first book was published in 1812, they began their second volume, \"German Legends,\" which was published in 1818. The book that started their international success was not any of their tales, but Jacob’s publication of \"German Grammar\" in 1819. This was one year after their publication of the \"German Legends\". In 1825, the Brothers published their \"Kleine Ausgabe\" or \"small edition\", a selection of 50 tales designed for child readers. This children's version went through ten editions between 1825 and 1858.\n\nIn 1830, Jacob became a professor at University of Göttingen and shortly after, in 1835, Wilhelm also became a professor. During these years Jacob wrote a third volume of \"German Grammar\" and Wilhelm prepared the third revision of the \"Children’s and Household Tales\".\n\nIn 1837, King Ernst August II revoked the constitution of 1833 and was attempting to restore absolutism for the Kingdom of Hannover. Since Göttingen was a part of Hannover, the brothers were expected to take an oath of allegiance. However, the brothers and five other professors led a protest against this and were heavily supported by the student body since all of these professors were well renowned. Jacob left Göttingen immediately and Wilhelm followed him a few months later back to Kassel.\n\nIn Kassel, the Grimms devoted themselves to researching and studying. A close friend of theirs, Bettina von Arnim, was also a talented writer. Savigny and others convinced the King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, to allow the brothers to teach and conduct research at the University of Berlin. In March 1841, the brothers did just this and also continued to work on the \"German Dictionary\".\n\n\"Kinder- und Hausmärchen\" (Children and Household Tales) is listed by UNESCO in its Memory of the World Registry.\n\nThe Grimms believed that the most natural and pure forms of culture were linguistic and based in history. The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of romantic nationalism, that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the Russian Alexander Afanasyev, the Norwegians Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe, the English Joseph Jacobs, and Jeremiah Curtin, an American who collected Irish tales. There was not always a pleased reaction to their collection. Joseph Jacobs was in part inspired by his complaint that English children did not read English fairy tales; in his own words, \"What Perrault began, the Grimms completed\".\n\nW. H. Auden praised the collection during World War II as one of the founding works of Western culture. The tales themselves have been put to many uses. Hitler praised them as folkish tales showing children with sound racial instincts seeking racially pure marriage partners, and so strongly that the Allied forces warned against them; for instance, \"Cinderella\" with the heroine as racially pure, the stepmother as an alien, and the prince with an unspoiled instinct being able to distinguish. Writers who have written about the Holocaust have combined the tales with their memoirs, as Jane Yolen in her \"Briar Rose\".\n\nThree individual works of Wilhelm Grimm include \"Altdänische Heldenlieder, Balladen und Märchen\" ('Old Danish Heroic Songs, Ballads, and Folktales') in 1811, \"Über deutsche Runen\" ('On German Runes') in 1821, and \"Die deutsche Heldensage\" ('The German Heroic Saga') in 1829.\n\nThe Grimm anthology has been a source of inspiration for artists and composers. Arthur Rackham, Walter Crane and Rie Cramer are among the artists who have created illustrations based on the stories.\n\nThe code \"KHM\" stands for \"Kinder- und Hausmärchen\". The titles are those as of 1857. Some titles in 1812 were different. All editions from 1812 until 1857 split the stories into two volumes.\n\n\n\nThe children's legends (\"\")first appeared in the G. Reimer 1819 edition at the end of volume 2\n\n\n\n\nInternet Archive reproductions of historic editions:\n"}

The archival collection contains unpublished papers and records from notable activists, artists, businesses and organizations related to the subject matter.\n\nNotable library resources include the writings of the Marquis de Sade, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, Laura Antoniou, John Preston and Larry Townsend. Complete sets of Drummer magazine, Bound & Gagged, SandMutopia Guardian and other periodicals are also available in the library.\n\nNotable museum artifacts include original works by Tom of Finland, the largest collection of original Etienne works in the world, historic sadomasochism and sexual devices, and colors (patches worn on the back of leather vests) from hundreds of existing and former Gay and Lesbian motorcycle clubs, leather clubs and sex clubs. A complete inventory of photographs taken by Kris Studios, a legendary publisher of physique photographs in the 1950s also resides at the LA&M.\n\nNotable archival collections include the papers of Tony DeBlase, Joseph Bean, Jim Kane, Leonard Dworkin and the records of The National Leather Association, International Mr. Leather, and The Mineshaft.\n\nThe museum exhibitions and library are open to the public (18 years and older) during regular museum hours. Archival collections are made available by appointment to bona fide researchers.\n\nIn August 1991, the LA&M was incorporated in the state of Illinois. From that date until May 1993, the Leather Archives was, in effect, an idea struggling to take form. In 1993, 1994 and 1995, the LA&M existed as a growing collection and appeared in public only as exhibits at International Mr. Leather in Chicago (plus a couple of abortive attempts to appear on the road). In fact, most members of the Leather Communities of the world - even in North America - were still unaware of the LA&M. In 1996, a storefront home for the LA&M was opened in Chicago. Much larger exhibits were mounted in this space, but the collection outgrew the space very rapidly.\n\nIn July 1997, Joseph W. Bean arrived to take on the job of Executive Director of the LA&M. Within three months, he had started a series of changing exhibits and proposed to the Board of Directors a capital campaign to raise funds to buy a building. The capital campaign was announced in December 1997, and met with immediate success.\n\nThe LA&M moved into its permanent home in late 1999. The building provided for exhibits and the effective storage of the ever-growing collection of leather history. In January 2002, Joseph Bean retired from the LA&M, and then-volunteer Rick Storer was hired to continue the work started by Bean and the entire leather community. In August 2004, the leather community made a $225,000 balloon payment to pay off the mortgage of the LA&M. Also during 2004, the exhibit space was expanded from one gallery to a full building tour of eight galleries.\n\nIn 2005, a travel exhibit was for the first time in Europe for an extended time, traveling the continent organized by Matthias \"Leatherbound\", European coordinator for the Leather Archives and Museum. The roadshow has been to many places and been seen by hundreds, showing Leather BDSM Fetish history. The exhibit arrived in Europe on 30 July 2005. During 26–30 October 2005, at Leatherpride in Amsterdam, the travelling exhibit is back at Rob Amsterdam during this special season of leather, SM and fetish.\n\nThe Leather Archives and Museum features several exhibitions:\n\nThere are also several online exhibitions:\n\n"}

It now fails to uphold universal ideas of justice, fails to sympathize with the oppressed, and has lost its commitment to truth. The left, according to Levy, has replaced those ideals with a pathological hatred of America, of Jews and Israel, and of freedom and liberty itself.\n\nLevy also attempts to debunk what he identifies as the six chief claims of the contemporary European and American left. Liberalism is not merely the free market, it is also about democracy and human rights. Europe is about more than capitalism. America is not a fascist nation. Humanitarian intervention is humanitarian, not an imperialist ploy. Israel is not the cause of anti-Semitism. Islamism is homegrown, not caused by the West, and it threatens the West just as seriously as fascism once did.\n\nThe contemporary left, according to Levy, believes that any opponent of America or capitalism is good by definition. It is this reasoning that has led the left to support the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein; to turn the World Conference against Racism 2001 into a forum for anti-Semitic hatred, and the Sudanese government's attacks first on southern Sudan and now on the people of Darfur because that government is anti-American and no anti-American government is to be criticized.\n\nLevy, who continues to consider himself a member of the \"left\", says that the book grew out of a phone call he received from French President Nicolas Sarkozy on January 23, 2007 asking for his support in the Presidential campaign. Levy responded that, \"no matter how much I like and respect you, the Left is my family\", to which Sarkozy replied, \"These people who've spent 30 years telling you to go (expletive) yourself? Do you really believe what you're saying, that these people are your family?\"\n\nThe phone call set Levy thinking, and he concluded that his abiding commitment to the left is rooted in his \"adherence to the freedom and dignity of the individual, anti-fascism, anti-colonialism and 'the anti-totalitarianism that is the legacy of May '68'.\"\n\nThe \"New Barbarism\" thesis has been criticised by Dag Tuastad, who argues that the New Barbarian writers tend to equate \"terrorism\" with \"Islam\" and \"the Arab Mind\", explaining the former as irrational, and therefore a threat from backward cultures. This neo Orientalist approach justifies continuation of colonialist violence in the Middle East and elsewhere It has also been argued by Paul Richards that the widely-perceived \"barbarism\" of rebel groups in resource-rich regions (like Sierra Leone), is not so \"irrational\" once you understand the distorted images of dominated people. The New Barbarism tends to blame the victims for their own condition, so justifying their hegemony.\n\n\n"}

They were, however, made available separately, both through mail-order and at book and video-game shops. Nintendo did also once offer a subscription motive that included four of the aforementioned \"Player's Guide\"s instead of only one.\n\nFollowing these four \"Player's Guide\"s, a fifth was released to Nintendo Power subscribers entitled Top Secret Passwords, containing passwords for a wide variety of NES, SNES, and Game Boy games. While initially billed as a subscriber exclusive, this guide was eventually sold at retailers.\n\nIn its later years, each \"Player's Guide\" published features one specific game, much like the earlier \"Nintendo Power Strategy Guides\". These \"Nintendo Power\" branded \"Player's Guide\"s are available only for Nintendo-published games, but the concept is now emulated by other publishing companies such as Brady Games or Prima for major releases on all video game consoles.

Brawl\", or \"Endless Ocean\", and none have been announced for soon-to-be-released major Nintendo projects.\n\nThis end of guide production was apparently due to the impending switch from in-house publication of \"NP\" to publication by Future US, which occurred in November 2007.\n\nIn a recent issue of \"Nintendo Power\", an \"NP\" subscriber wrote to Nintendo, asking about the status of the \"Player's Guide\" series.

{"id": "28844699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28844699", "title": "Plague doctor contract", "text": "Plague doctor contract\n\nA plague doctor contract was an agreement between a town's administrators and a \"doctor\" to treat bubonic plague patients. These contracts are present in European city archives. A plague doctor was specifically hired by a European city or town to treat plague patients, rich or poor, in times of epidemics. They were especially designed for the poor that could not afford to pay. Their contractual responsibility was twofold: to treat plague patients and to refrain from treating other types of patients, the latter provision representing an attempt to prevent the spread of disease from plague victims to other patients via a shared physician. In many cases these \"doctors\" were either volunteers, second-rate doctors, or new young doctors starting a career. A plague doctor had to serve a long quarantine after seeing a plague patient in his plague doctor costume. He was regarded as a \"contact\" who by agreement had to live in isolation to be quarantined.\n\nThe bargaining which always preceded the final contract often consisted of serious negotiations. For example, the town administrators of Turin in 1630 were considering the terms of an agreement requested by one Dr. Maletto to become their plague doctor. After much negotiating, they instructed their broker representatives to make a fair and prompt deal as soon as possible with this Dr. Maletto. They were told to get the best possible deal for their city, but to be careful not to lose the opportunity of hiring this plague doctor as it would be difficult to find someone else to perform these dangerous duties at such a low rate.\n\nAs an example of the tough negotiating that went on between plague doctors and infected European towns, there is in Pavia an original agreement between one Giovanni de Ventura and the city in their archives that shows a sixteen clause contract that was further amended even after originally written. Clause one originally showed 30 florins per month for pay, but later modified to be net of living expenses. Clause two was originally that the pay was to be given two months in advance, but later modified to monthly. Clause five provided originally a severance pay of two months, however modified later that to one month's pay. Clause six said \"the said master Giovanni shall not be bound nor held under obligation except only in attending the plague patients\" which was later amplified with \"...the doctor must treat all patients and visit infected places as it shall be found to be necessary.\" Clause seven had to do with full citizenship and the original text was modified with \"according to how he shall behave himself.\"\n\nBernardino di Francesco Rinaldi obtained a clause in his contract when he was hired as plague doctor by the city of Volterra in 1527 that said essentially that the city had the obligation to provide Bernardino with all and everything necessary for his life support (i.e. food, water), and for these living expenses to be paid through the city expenditures.\n\nIn 1527, in the city of Prato, a plague doctor by the name of Stefano Mezzettino was noticed attending other patients without a custodian. The rule was in the plague doctor contract that a custodian must always be with the plague doctor when he visits other patients. This created much danger for the public. He was fined for his illegal act and breaking the rule of the plague doctor contract.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48000439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48000439", "title": "Records Continuum Model", "text": "Records Continuum Model\n\nThe Records Continuum Model (RCM) was created in the 1990s by Monash University academic Frank Upward with input from colleagues Sue McKemmish and Livia Iacovino as a response to evolving discussions about the challenges of managing digital records and archives in the discipline of Archival Science. The RCM was first published in Upward’s 1996 paper \"Structuring the Records Continuum – Part One: Postcustodial principles and properties\". Upward describes the RCM within the broad context of a continuum where activities and interactions transform documents into records, evidence and memory that are used for multiple purposes over time. Upward places the RCM within a post-custodial, postmodern and structuration conceptual framework. Australian academics and practitioners continue to explore, develop and extend the RCM and records continuum theory, along with international collaborators, via the Records Continuum Research Group (RCRG) at Monash University.\n\nThe RCM is an abstract conceptual model that helps to understand and explore recordkeeping activities (as interaction) in relation to multiple contexts over space and time (spacetime). Recordkeeping activities take place from before the records are created by identifying recordkeeping requirements in policies, systems, organizations, processes, laws, social mandates that impact on what is created and how it is managed over spacetime. In a continuum, recordkeeping processes, such as adding metadata, fix documents so that they can be managed as evidence. Those records deemed as having continuing value are retained and managed as an archive. The implication of an RCM approach to records and archives is that systems and processes can be designed and put in place before records are even created. A continuum approach therefore highlights that records are both current and archival at the point of creation.\n\nThe RCM is represented as a series of concentric rings (dimensions of \"Create\", \"Capture\", \"Organize\" and \"Pluralize\") and crossed axes (transactionality, evidentiality, recordkeeping and identity) with each axis labelled with a description of the activity or interaction that occurs at that intersection. \"Create\", \"Capture\", \"Organize\" and \"Pluralize\" represent recordkeeping activities that occur within spacetime. Activities that occur in these dimensions across the axes are explained in the table below:\n\nThe value of the RCM is that it can help to map where on a continuum recordkeeping activities are or can be placed. The RCM can then be used to explore the conceptual and practical assumptions that underpin the practice, in particular the dualisms inherent in the usage and practice of the terms \"records\" and \"archives\". This definition lends itself to a linear reading of the RCM – starting at \"Create\" as the initiating phase and working outwards towards \"Pluralization\" of recorded information. Another linear reading is to consider design first – the role that systems of \"Pluralization\" and \"Organization\" play in designing, planning and implementing recordkeeping and then considering the implications for \"Create\" and \"Capture\". However, these are just two of many ways to interpret the model as the dimensions and axes represent multiple realities that occur within spacetime, any of which can occur simultaneously, concurrently and sequentially in electronic or digital environments, and/or physical spaces.\n\nBy representing multiple realities, the RCM articulates the numerous and diverse perspectives that contribute to records and archives including individual, group, community, organizational, institutional and societal. These contexts reveal the need to take into account various stakeholders and co-contributors in relation to use, access and appraisal of records and archives. Over the lifespan of a record multiple decisions are made by various stakeholders of the records that include, but are not limited to records managers and archivists. Other stakeholders can be identified at various dimensions of interaction, including those involved in providing information (not only the person or organization who produced or captured it), as well as their family and community. Records are therefore not simply physical or digital representations of physical objects held and managed in an archive or repository, but are evidence of multiple perspectives, narratives and contexts that contributed to their formation.\n\nThe RCM is often described as being in contrast or at odds with the lifecycle records model. While the RCM is inclusive of multiple ways of conceptualizing and performing recordkeeping, including a lifecycle approach, there are some significant differences. Firstly, where the lifecycle approach shows clearly demarcated phases in the management of records, a continuum approach conceptualizes elements as continuous with no discernable parts. Secondly, the lifecycle approach identifies clear conceptual and procedural boundaries between active or current records and inactive or historical records, but a continuum approach sees records processes as more integrated across spacetime. In the continuum it is recordkeeping processes that carry records forward through spacetime to enable their use for multiple purposes. What this means is that records are always \"in a state of always becoming...\", and able to contribute new contexts via the recordkeeping processes that occur with them. Archival records are therefore not just historical, but are able to be re-interpreted, re-created, and re-contextualized according to their place and use in spacetime. In this way, archival institutions are nodes in the network of recorded information and its contexts, rather than the end point in a lifecycle stage for records that are managed as \"relics\".\n\nThe RCM is a representation of what is commonly referred to as records continuum theory, as well as Australian continuum thinking and/or approaches. These ideas were evolved as part of an Australian approach to archival management espoused by Ian Maclean, Chief Archivist of the Commonwealth Archives Office in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s. Maclean, whose ideas and practices were the subject of the first RCRG publication in 1994, referred in a 1959 \"American Archivist\" article to a \"continuum of (public) records administration\" from administrative efficiency through recordkeeping to the safe keeping of a \"cultural end-product\". Maclean’s vision challenged the divide between current recordkeeping and archival practice. Fellow contemporary at the Commonwealth Archives Office Peter Scott is also included as a core influence on Australian records continuum theory with his development of the Australian Series System, a registry system that helped identify and document the complex and multiple \"social, functional, provenancial, and documentary relationships\" involved in managing records and recordkeeping processes over spacetime.\n\nFurther influences on the RCRG group include archival professionals and researchers like David Bearman and his work on transactionality and systems thinking, and Terry Cook's ideas about postcustodialism and macroappraisal. Wider influencing ideas include those from philosophers and social theorists Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Jean-François Lyotard, as well as sociologist Anthony Giddens, with structuration theory being a core component of understanding social interaction over spacetime. Canadian archivist Jay Atherton's critique of the division between records managers and archivists in the 1980s and use of the term \"records continuum\" re-commenced the conversation MacLean began during his career and helped to bring his ideas and this term to Australian records continuum thinking. Atherton's use of the term records continuum has several significant differences in conception, application and heritage when compared to Australian records continuum thinking.\n\nPost-custodiality as an archival concept plays a major role in how the RCM was conceived. This term was born from an identified and urgent need to address the complexities of computer technologies on records creation and management over time and space. Post-custodiality is discussed by Frank Upward and Sue McKemmish in 1994 as part of an exploration of changes in archival discourse commencing in the 1980s by Gerald Ham and expanded on by Terry Cook as part of a \"post-custodial paradigm shift\". Post-custodiality in relation to the RCM is explored by Upward and McKemmish as an entry point into a wider conversation about records and recordkeeping being part of a process in which archival institutions have a part to play beyond that of the archival authority handling, appraisal, describing and arranging physical objects in their custody.\n\nDrawing from the above theoretical foundations, the RCM as a framework acknowledges the central role that recordkeeping activities have on the creation, capture, organization and ongoing management of records over time and throughout spaces such as organizations and institutional archives. Recordkeeping is a practice and a concept clearly defined in the archival and records literature by continuum writers as \"a broad and inclusive concept of integrated recordkeeping and archiving processes for current, regulatory, and historical recordkeeping purposes\". Recordkeeping refers to the activities performed on records that add new contexts such as capturing a record into a system, adding metadata, or selecting it for an archive. In the RCM records are therefore not defined according to their status as objects. Rather, records are understood as being part of a continuum of activity related to known (as well as potentially unknown) contexts. A record (as well as records, collections and archives) are therefore part of larger social, cultural, political, legal and archival processes. It is these contexts that are vital to understanding the role, value and evidential qualities of records in and across spacetime (past, present and potential future).\n\nThe RCM is the most well-known of all the continuum models created, but does not exist in isolation. Several other complementary models have been created by RCM creator Frank Upward, and there are others created by continuum researchers that offer enhanced or alternative ways of understanding the continuum.\n\nThe series of continuum models created by Frank Upward include:\n\nModels created in collaboration:\n\nOther models:\n\n"}

The museum is located at the Museum Square in the borough Amsterdam South, close to the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, and the Concertgebouw.\n\nThe Rijksmuseum was founded in The Hague in 1800 and moved to Amsterdam in 1808, where it was first located in the Royal Palace and later in the Trippenhuis. The current main building was designed by Pierre Cuypers and first opened in 1885. On 13 April 2013, after a ten-year renovation which cost € 375 million, the main building was reopened by Queen Beatrix. In 2013 and 2014, it was the most visited museum in the Netherlands with record numbers of 2.2 million and 2.47 million visitors. It is also the largest art museum in the country.\n\nThe museum has on display 8,000 objects of art and history, from their total collection of 1 million objects from the years 1200–2000, among which are some masterpieces by Rembrandt, Frans Hals, and Johannes Vermeer. The museum also has a small Asian collection, which is on display in the Asian pavilion.\n\nIn 1795, the Batavian Republic was proclaimed. The Minister of Finance Isaac Gogel argued that a national museum, following the French example of The Louvre, would serve the national interest. On 19 November 1798, the government decided to found the museum.\n\nOn 31 May 1800, the National Art Gallery (Dutch: \"Nationale Kunst-Galerij\"), precursor of the Rijksmuseum, opened in Huis ten Bosch in The Hague. The museum exhibited around 200 paintings and historic objects from the collections of the Dutch stadtholders.\n\nIn 1805, the National Art Gallery moved within The Hague to the Prince William V Gallery, on the Buitenhof.\n\nIn 1806, the Kingdom of Holland was established by Napoleon Bonaparte. On the orders of king Louis Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, the museum moved to Amsterdam in 1808. The paintings owned by that city, such as \"The Night Watch\" by Rembrandt, became part of the collection. In 1809, the museum opened in the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1817, the museum moved to the Trippenhuis. The Trippenhuis turned out to be unsuitable as a museum. In 1820, the historical objects were moved to the Mauritshuis in The Hague and in 1838, the 19th-century paintings \"of living masters\" were moved to king Louis Bonaparte's former summer palace Paviljoen Welgelegen in Haarlem.\n\nIn 1863, there was a design contest for a new building for the Rijksmuseum, but none of the submissions was considered to be of sufficient quality. Pierre Cuypers also participated in the contest and his submission reached the second place.\n\nIn 1876, a new contest was held and this time Pierre Cuypers won. The design was a combination of gothic and renaissance elements. The construction began on 1 October 1876. On both the inside and the outside, the building was richly decorated with references to Dutch art history. Another contest was held for these decorations. The winners were B. van Hove and J.F. Vermeylen for the sculptures, G. Sturm for the tile tableaus and painting and W.F. Dixon for the stained glass. The museum was opened at its new location on 13 July 1885.\n\nIn 1890, a new building was added a short distance to the south-west of the Rijksmuseum. As the building was made out of fragments of demolished buildings, the building offers an overview of the history of Dutch architecture and has come to be known informally as the 'fragment building'. It is also known as the 'south wing' and is currently (in 2013) branded the \"Philips Wing\".\n\nIn 1906, the hall for the \"Night Watch\" was rebuilt. In the interior more changes were made between the 1920s and 1950s - most multi-coloured wall decorations were painted over. In the 1960s exposition rooms and several floors were built into the two courtyards. The building had some minor renovations and restorations in 1984, 1995–1996 and 2000.\n\nA renovation of the south wing of the museum, also known as the 'fragment building' or 'Philips Wing', was completed in 1996, the same year that the museum held its first major photography exhibition featuring its extensive collection of 19th-century photos.\n\nIn December 2003, the main building of the museum closed for a major renovation. During this renovation, about 400 objects from the collection were on display in the 'fragment building', including Rembrandt's \"The Night Watch\" and other 17th-century masterpieces.\n\nThe restoration and renovation of the Rijksmuseum are based on a design by Spanish architects Antonio Cruz and Antonio Ortiz. Many of the old interior decorations were restored and the floors in the courtyards were removed. The renovation would have initially taken five years, but was delayed and eventually took almost ten years to complete. The renovation cost € 375 million.\n\nThe reconstruction of the building was completed on 16 July 2012. In March 2013, the museum's main pieces of art were moved back from the 'fragment building' (Philips Wing) to the main building. \"The Night Watch\" returned to the Night Watch Room, at the end of the Hall of Fame. On 13 April 2013, the main building was reopened by Queen Beatrix. On 1 November 2014, the Philips Wing reopened with the exhibition .\n\n\nThe building of the Rijksmuseum was designed by Pierre Cuypers and opened in 1885. It consists of two squares with an atrium in each centre. In the central axis is a tunnel with the entrances at ground level and the Gallery of Honour at the first floor. The building also contains a library. The fragment building, branded Philips wing, contains building fragments that show the history of architecture in the Netherlands. The Rijksmuseum is a \"rijksmonument\" (national heritage site) since 1970 and was listed in the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites in 1990. The Asian pavilion was designed by Cruz y Ortiz and opened in 2013.\n\nAccording to Muriel Huisman, Project Architect for the Rijksmuseum's renovation, \"Cruz y Ortiz always like to look for a synergy between old and new, and we try not to explain things with our architecture.” With the Rijks, “there’s no cut between old and new; we’ve tried to merge it. We did this by looking for materials that were true to the original building, resulting in a kind of silent architecture.\"\n\nThe collection of the Rijksmuseum consists of 1 million objects and is dedicated to arts, crafts, and history from the years 1200 to 2000. Around 8000 objects are currently on display in the museum.\n\nThe collection contains more than 2,000 paintings from the Dutch Golden Age by notable painters such as Jacob van Ruisdael, Frans Hals, Johannes Vermeer, Jan Steen, Rembrandt, and Rembrandt's pupils.\n\nThe museum also has a small Asian collection which is on display in the Asian pavilion.\n\nIt also displays the stern of HMS \"Royal Charles\" which was captured in the Raid on the Medway, and the Hartog plate.\n\nIn 2012, the museum took the unusual step of making some 125,000 high-resolution images available for download via its Rijksstudio webplatform, with plans to add another 40,000 images per year until the entire collection of one million works is available, according to Taco Dibbits, director of collections.\n\nThe 20th-century visitor record of 1,412,000 was reached in the year 1975.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, the Rijksmuseum was annually visited by 0.9 to 1.3 million people. On 7 December 2003, the main building of the museum was closed for a renovation until 13 April 2013. In the following decade, the number of visitors slightly decreased to 0.8 to 1.1 million people. The museum says after the renovation, the museum's capacity is 1.5 to 2.0 million visitors annually. Within eight months since the reopening in 2013, the museum was visited by 2 million people.\n\nThe museum had 2.2 million visitors in 2013 and reached an all-time record of 2.47 million visitors in 2014. The museum was the most visited museum in the Netherlands and the 19th most visited art museum in the world in 2013 and 2014.\n\nThe Rijksmuseum Research Library is part of the Rijksmuseum, and is the best and the largest public art history research library in The Netherlands.\n\nRijks, stylized as RIJKS®, is a restaurant with 140 seats in the Philips Wing.

{"id": "9031174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9031174", "title": "Scream (franchise)", "text": "Scream (franchise)\n\nScream is an American horror franchise created by Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven. Starring Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette, the film series grossed over $604 million in worldwide box-office receipts and consists of four motion pictures directed by Craven. The first series entry, \"Scream\", was released on December 20, 1996 and is currently the highest-grossing slasher film in the United States. The second entry \"Scream 2\" was released on December 12, 1997 followed by a third installment, \"Scream 3\", released February 4, 2000. Eleven years after the previous film, \"Scream 4\" was released on April 15, 2011. The films follow Sidney Prescott, and her war against a succession of murderers who adopt the guise of Ghostface to stalk and torment their victims. Sidney receives support in the films from town deputy Dewey Riley, reporter Gale Weathers, and film-geek Randy Meeks. A television spin-off of the film series was launched by MTV on June 30, 2015. The TV series follows different characters and new storylines which are not connected to the film series.\n\nWilliamson's original script was bought by Miramax and developed under the Dimension Films label by Bob and Harvey Weinstein, who recruited Craven to direct. Craven in turn recruited composer Marco Beltrami to score the film. This team went on to be involved in each film in the series though Williamson was forced to take a smaller role for \"Scream 3\", writing only a brief plot outline due to his commitments to other projects, with Ehren Kruger replacing him as screenwriter. The series' violence resulted in conflicts with the Motion Picture Association of America and news media concerning censorship resulting in a reduction of violence and gore in \"Scream 3\" when the Columbine High School massacre brought increased focus on the media's influence on society. \"Scream\" became notable for its use of established and recognizable actors which was uncommon for horror films at the time, yet has since become common in part due to \"Scream\"s success.\n\nThe series, particularly the first two films, has received significant critical acclaim. \"Scream\" has been credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the late 1990s by combining a traditional slasher film with humor, awareness of horror film clichés and a clever plot. \"Scream\" was one of the highest-grossing films of 1996 and became the highest-grossing slasher film in the world, an honor it still holds. Its success was matched by \"Scream 2\", which not only broke box-office records of the time but was also considered superior to the original by some critics. \"Scream 3\" fared worse than its predecessors, both critically and financially, with critics commenting that it had become the type of horror film it originally parodied in \"Scream\". \"Scream 4\" also received mixed reviews from critics, although some claimed that it was an improvement over its predecessor. The film series has been the recipient of several awards, including a Saturn Award for Best Actress and MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance for Campbell and a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film for \"Scream\".\n\nThe film series began with \"Scream\", premiering on December 18, 1996 at the AMC Avco theater in Westwood, California and was generally released on December 20, 1996. Based on a screenplay by screenwriter Kevin Williamson and directed by Wes Craven, creator of the \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise, \"Scream\" offered a self-referential approach to horror by featuring a cast of characters aware of the conventions/clichés of the horror film genre and able to use them to survive. The film focuses on teenager Sidney Prescott as she comes under attack from a mysterious character dubbed Ghostface while dealing with the anniversary of her mother's murder. The film went on to be a financial success and received considerable critical acclaim for its deconstruction of the horror genre. It is credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the mid 90s and inspiring an array of imitators. It was particularly notable for its casting of established and popular actors and actresses which was previously uncommon in a horror movie.\n\nThe series continued with \"Scream 2\", premiering at Mann's Chinese Theater, followed by general release in December 1997, again written by Williamson and directed by Craven, released less than a year after the original film. Like \"Scream\", the film features characters aware of the horror genre and the conventions of the horror sequel, mocking them while simultaneously falling victim to them. Set in 1998, The film again focuses on the character of Sidney Prescott, now a college student, as a series of copycat crimes begin, the killers again using the disguise of Ghostface. The film was financially successful, and receiving similar critical praise for its deconstruction of the horror film sequel and commentary on the influence of the media in society. The script for \"Scream 2\" was leaked during production revealing the identity of the killers and so the film underwent extensive rewrites, changing the identity of the killers though their motivation remained intact.\n\nThe series continued with \"Scream 3\", which received its premiere on February 3, 2000 at the AMC Avco theater in Westwood, California and was generally released on February 4, 2000. Like previous entries, the film was directed by Craven, but Williamson was unable to formulate a complete script due to his commitment to the short-lived television series \"Wasteland\" and his original film \"Teaching Mrs. Tingle\" (1999), being replaced by Ehren Kruger who finalized a script based on several ideas supplied by Williamson. Set in 2001, The film focuses on Sidney Prescott who faces a new Ghostface killer and the truth about her mother that led to the start of the Ghostface killings. The film, like its predecessors, featured characters who were self-aware of horror conventions, in this case the rules and structure of the final entry in a movie trilogy. \"Scream 3\" was considerably less successful than the previous two installments, suffering both financially and critically, commentators noting that the film had become akin to the horror films it originally parodied in \"Scream\" and \"Scream 2\". Others were critical of the change in tone, focusing more on humor instead of horror and violence. However, critics who reacted positively were supportive of this change in tone and praised the film for successfully completing the film trilogy.\n\nIn July 2008, The Weinstein Company announced the development of a new sequel, \"Scream 4\", written by Williamson with Craven being secured for the project in March 2010. In May 2010, Cathy Konrad, producer of the original three \"Scream\" films filed a $3 million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company alleging they violated an agreement with her company, Cat Entertainment, that gave them first rights to produce all \"Scream\" films. The Weinstein Company argued that the agreement requires Konrad's services to be exclusive to the franchise, an argument that Konrad called \"false pretext\" as the previous films did not require this stipulation. Konrad accused the Weinsteins of attempting to force her to walk away without compensation in order to hire a cheaper producer (Craven's wife Iya Labunka) and cut costs. In April 2011, it was reported that the case had been settled out of court by The Weinstein Company.\n\nThe film underwent reshoots of some scenes in January 2011 with Craven stating that they were to enhance some scenes but that the ending remains untouched, countering criticism that, following a January 6, 2011 test screening, the film may undergo significant changes due to poor audience responses. The fourth installment premiered on April 11, 2011 at Grauman's Chinese Theater with a public release following April 15, 2011. The film received mixed reviews from critics, earning a 59% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nCraven confirmed that he was contracted to work on a fifth and sixth installment of the \"Scream\" franchise, to be made if the fourth film achieved a successful release and reception. Following difficulties with script rewrites on \"Scream 2\", \"Scream 3\" and \"Scream 4\", often with pages only being ready on the day of filming, and the related stress of the situation, Craven stated that he would need to see a finalized version of a script for \"Scream 5\" before committing to the production. Williamson also confirmed his contractual obligation for \"Scream 4\" and \"Scream 5\", having submitted concepts for three films leading up to \"Scream 6\", though his contract for the sixth film had not yet been finalized. Williamson indicated that if a \"Scream 5\" were to be made, it would be a continuation of the story of the characters who lived through \"Scream 4\" but that \"Scream 4\" would not include any cliffhangers that led into the potential sequel.\n\nActor David Arquette also added his support to the potential future of the franchise, stating \"It [the ending] definitely leaves it open,\" before adding that he would welcome the opportunity to play the character of Dewey in future installments. In May 2011, executive producer Harvey Weinstein confirmed that a sequel was possible, saying that despite \"Scream 4\" performing below The Weinstein Company's financial expectations, he was still happy with the gross it had accrued. In February 2012, when asked about a potential \"Scream 5\", Williamson stated at the time that he did not know, saying \"I'm not doing it.\"\n\nOn June 4, 2012, it was reported that MTV was in the early stages of developing a weekly television series spun off from the franchise. David Arquette confirmed that he would not be a part of the television series. On April 25, 2013, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" confirmed that MTV has greenlit the TV series, with Wes Craven in talks of directing the pilot. On July 26, 2013 it was reported that \"Criminal Minds\" writers Jay Beattie and Dan Dworkin have officially boarded the project to pen the pilot script. The series premiered in 2015.\n\nOn September 30, 2013, Harvey Weinstein expressed his dire interest in a fifth installment, stating: \"I'm begging him to do the movie and just end it. We've milked that cow.\"\n\nIn a June 2015 interview with the Washington Street Journal, Bob Weinstein firmly denied the possibility of a fifth installment or any further continuation of the film franchise, citing the MTV series as the right place for the franchise to find new life. \"It's like putting an art-house movie in an art-house theater,\" Weinstein said. \"Where the teens reside is MTV.\"\n\nOn June 4, 2012, it was reported that MTV were in the early stages of developing a weekly television series spin-off from the franchise. David Arquette confirmed that he would not be a part of the television series. On April 25, 2013, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" confirmed that MTV has greenlit the TV series, with Wes Craven in talks of directing the pilot. On July 26, 2013, it was reported that \"Criminal Minds\" writers Jay Beattie and Dan Dworkin have officially boarded the project to pen the pilot script. On April 2, 2014, it was reported that the show would be penned by Jill Blotevogel (\"Ravenswood, Harper's Island, Eureka\"), and will focus on a YouTube video gone viral, which will have adverse repercussions for teenagers of Lakewood and serve as the 'catalyst for a murder that opens up a window to the town’s troubled past.' The leads actors are Willa Fitzgerald, Bex Taylor-Klaus, Bobby Campo, Connor Weil, Carlson Young, Amadeus Serafini and John Karna. The script by Jill Blotevogel of the pilot episode, originally titled \"Red Roses\", was published in February 2015 on the blog Bleeding Cool.\n\nOn April 12, 2015, the first trailer for the series was aired during the 2015 MTV Movie Awards presented by Bella Thorne, also revealing the final premiere date of the series, which aired on June 30, 2015.\n\nAn official promotional picture of the series' re-imagined mask was revealed in early June 2015. Initially, Craven expressed his approval of the redesign and hinted at its origins and possible plot significance. However, Craven was later critical about the network's decision to abandon the Ghostface mask in the television series.\n\nOn August 30, 2015, Wes Craven died of brain cancer. The season 1 finale episode \"Revelations\" made a tribute to him during the opening credits.\n\nThe second season of MTV's \"Scream\" premiered on May 30, 2016.\n\nOn October 14, 2016, MTV renewed the series for a six-episode third season, which will premiere in 2018. On April 26, 2017, MTV announced that they were rebooting the series with the third season, with a new cast and setting. As part of the reboot process, it was revealed that Brett Matthews will be serving as the main showrunner. In addition, Queen Latifah, Shakim Compere and Yaneley Arty will be added as executive producers for the series under Flavor Unit Entertainment. The new cast members for the season are Tyga, C.J. Wallace, Jessica Sula, RJ Cyler, Keke Palmer, Giullian Yao Gioiello, Giorgia Whigham and Tyler Posey.\n\nOn September 18, 2017, it was announced that the Ghostface mask from the film series would be making an appearance in the third season. On October 10, 2017, Keke Palmer confirmed in an interview that Roger L. Jackson, who voiced Ghostface in the film series, would return for the third season, replacing Mike Vaughn, who served as the voice for The Killer in the first two seasons.\n\nCraven initially intended to hire talented, but relatively unknown actors who had not yet had a \"big break\" in the film industry, as he had done with \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\"&apos;s Johnny Depp and \"Shocker\"&apos;s Peter Berg. However, the decision was made to cast actors who already had a notable body of work, marking a change from many previous horror films where casting current, popular actors was unheard of. Craven believed their budget was inadequate to secure the actors they were pursuing but felt that Barrymore's presence made people eager to take part and accepting of a lower salary.\n\n<nowiki> </nowiki>\nDrew Barrymore initially approached the production herself after reading the script and was signed to play Sidney Prescott. However, as time progressed, her schedule commitments meant she would be unable to remain in the leading role, so she volunteered to play the smaller role of Casey Becker who dies early in the film. The production felt that killing off an actress of Barrymore's stature early on would be a risk but thought that it would be shocking to the audience and make them believe that no other character was safe. Following Barrymore's changed role, Alicia Witt and Brittany Murphy auditioned for the lead and the production also considered contacting Reese Witherspoon. The role was ultimately given to Neve Campbell after the director saw her in \"Party of Five\", believing she could best embody a character who was \"innocent\" but also able to handle herself while dealing with the physicality and emotions of the role. Though reluctant to undertake another horror film so soon after \"The Craft\", Campbell chose to do \"Scream\" as it would be her first leading role and she \"adored\" the character, saying \"She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie.\" The production wanted a recognizable face for the role of news reporter Gale Weathers, offering it to both Brooke Shields and Janeane Garofalo. Cox, who was starring in the hit NBC sitcom \"Friends\" at the time, was not considered due to her history of playing softer, kinder characters. Cox however lobbied hard for the role for that reason, wishing to play a \"bitch\" character, her efforts ultimately succeeding when she was cast. Actresses Melinda Clarke and Rebecca Gayheart auditioned for the role of Tatum Riley before Rose McGowan was cast due to her best embodying the \"spunky\" nature of the character. It was believed the collective strong female cast of Campbell, Barrymore, Cox and McGowan would help draw a significant female audience to the film.\n\nKevin Patrick Walls, who played Barrymore's boyfriend Steve Orth in the opening of \"Scream\", was one of the final candidates for the role of Sidney's boyfriend, Billy Loomis, alongside Justin Whalin before it was won by Skeet Ulrich. Campbell and Ulrich had a prior working relationship on \"The Craft\" which they believed help them better develop the relationship between Sidney and Billy. David Arquette was also approached for the role of Billy Loomis but instead wanted the role of Dewey. The role was described as \"hunky\" instead of the younger, \"goofier\" approach of Arquette but Craven appreciated the idea and cast him in the role. Matthew Lillard was cast by chance as he had accompanied his then-girlfriend to a separate audition where \"Scream\" casting director Lisa Beach saw him and asked him to audition, where he secured the role of Stu Macher. The role of Randy Meeks was contested between Jamie Kennedy and Breckin Meyer with the production favoring Kennedy. Having no major role prior to \"Scream\", the studio wanted a more prominent actor than Kennedy in the role but the production were adamant that he was the best choice and successfully fought to keep him in. Roger L. Jackson, voice of the character Ghostface, was picked at the end of several weeks of local casting in Santa Rosa. The production had originally intended to only use his voice temporarily but ultimately decided that it was perfect for the role. He was intentionally kept from meeting many members of the cast in all three original \"Scream\" films as it was thought it would help their performance if they could not put a face to the menacing voice. The calls made by his character were genuine phone calls conducted on set by Jackson to the characters, again with the intention of aiding the interaction between his character and the character being \"stalked\" in a scene.\n\nFor \"Scream 2\", Campbell had been contracted for a possible sequel before filming began on \"Scream\". However actors with surviving characters had a sequel option added after it was known which character would be eligible to appear in the next film. In interviews, the production staff of \"Scream 2\" stated they believed that Barrymore's role in \"Scream\" added an element of respectability to the genre that made actors normally reluctant to engage a horror film, eager to sign on to \"Scream 2\". Many of the actors involved including Campbell, Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jerry O'Connell were starring in their own television series at the time making scheduling their availability with the film difficult. Gellar in particular had also recently finished work on another Williamson-penned film, \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" (1997) which released two months prior to \"Scream 2\". She would admit in interviews that she signed on to \"Scream 2\" without having read the script, based on the success of the first film. Craven took their desire to participate in the film despite their workload as a compliment to the film's quality. To obtain the role of Derek, O'Connell and other candidates had to audition by performing a scene from the film where the character sings \"I Think I Love You\". The cast was rounded out by Laurie Metcalf, who had just finished a nine-year run on the popular sitcom \"Roseanne\", Lewis Arquette, father of David Arquette, Jada Pinkett and Timothy Olyphant in what was his first leading role in a feature film. Rebecca Gayheart, who had unsuccessfully auditioned to play Tatum Riley in \"Scream\", auditioned for the roles of Hallie, Cici and Maureen Evans before being cast as Sorority Sister Lois.\n\nFor \"Scream 3\", Craven stated in an interview that convincing the central cast to return was not difficult but their burgeoning fame and busy schedules made arranging their availability with the film's production troublesome. Campbell in particular was only available for 20 days of filming which resulted in a significantly reduced role for her character and a focus on Cox and Arquette's characters. Emily Mortimer was cast as Angelina Tyler but shortly after filming began it was discovered she lacked the required permit to work, resulting in her being flown to Vancouver to obtain one. Carrie Fisher made a cameo in the film at the suggestion of Bob Weinstein and Fisher helped write her character. Kelly Rutherford was cast after filming had begun as the production was undergoing constant rewrites and the opening scene evolved from requiring only a female corpse to needing a live actress with whom Schreiber could interact. In a 2009 interview, Matthew Lillard, who played Stu Macher in \"Scream\", claimed that he was signed to reprise his role in \"Scream 3\" as the primary antagonist but after the script moved in a direction without his character, he was bought out of his contract.\n\nWhen production of \"Scream 4\" was announced, Campbell initially refused offers to reprise her role as Sidney, forcing early script drafts to be written in consideration of her absence. However, in September 2009, Campbell, Cox and Arquette were all confirmed as reprising their roles as Sidney, Gale and Dewey respectively, with Jackson's commitment confirmed in July 2010. Continuing the trend started in \"Scream\", the production cast established and popular actors Hayden Panettiere, Rory Culkin, Anna Paquin, Kristen Bell and Emma Roberts. Roberts was cast as Jill, Sidney Prescott's cousin, beating out Ashley Greene for the role. Lake Bell and Lauren Graham were cast in the film but dropped out early into production, Bell citing scheduling conflicts. Nico Tortorella auditioned five times to secure the role of Trevor, the ex-boyfriend of Roberts' character, by reenacting a scene from \"Scream\" where the character of Billy Loomis reveals he is one of the killers.\n\n\"Scream\" (1996) was conceived under the title \"Scary Movie\" by screenwriter Kevin Williamson as an 18-page script inspired by a series of murders by the Gainesville Ripper that Williamson had seen in a news story and his own experience alone in a friends house after discovering an open window he had not previously noticed. The treatment covered what would become the opening scene of \"Scream\" featuring Drew Barrymore. Williamson began to expand this script into what ultimately became \"Scream\" because his previous script, \"Teaching Mrs. Tingle\", was in development hell, writing it in only three days in Palm Springs and bringing it to his agent in June 1995 to put it up for sale. Accompanying the script were two 5-page outlines for potential sequels to the film, Williamson hoping to provide added incentive to buy the script by providing potential for a franchise. Williamson would later claim he wrote the screenplay partly because it was a film he wanted to watch and \"nobody else is making it\". The script was self-referential, featuring characters who watched horror films and were aware of the conventions of the genre and featured numerous homages to many preceding horror films which Williamson would claim inspired him, including \"Halloween\", \"Friday the 13th\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Prom Night\".\n\nWilliamson was told early on by his agent, Rob Paris, that the saturation of violence and gore in his script would make it \"impossible\" to sell and following its purchase by Miramax he was required to remove much of the gorier scenes. However, once Craven was confirmed to direct, he was able to bring much of the excised content back. Williamson intended to remove a scene in the film that took place inside the fictional school's bathroom, feeling it was awkward but Craven salvaged it believing it had potential. Williamson later confirmed that he was glad Craven did so. The death of the character Principal Himbry was added at the request of producer Bob Weinstein who noted that there was thirty pages (thirty on-screen minutes) without a murder occurring. This later aided Williamson who was struggling to find motivation for characters to leave a party in the film's finale, now able to use the discovered corpse of the Himbry character. When writing the finale, Williamson was unsure what to cite as a motivation for the killers or whether to give them one at all. Opinions were split between staff on the picture, some who felt that a motive was necessary for the audience to be given resolution while others felt it was scarier without one. Ultimately Williamson decided to do both, giving the character Billy Loomis the motive of maternal abandonment while not giving the character of Stu Macher one, instead having the character jokingly suggest \"peer pressure\".\n\nFollowing the release of \"Scream\", Williamson confirmed that he had considered a concept for a sequel where the character Sidney Prescott attends college and a copycat killer begins stalking her. Dimension Films agreed to pursue a sequel in May 1997, by which point Williamson had already written 42 pages of the new script. By July 1996, filming began on \"Scream 2\", but his completed script was leaked on the Internet revealing much of the plot including the finale and the identity of the film's killers. As a result, the production was forced to continue filming with only a partial script as Williamson conducted rewrites, changing much of the finale, the killers victims and the killers identity. To preserve the identity of the killer or important plot points being revealed again, the actors were not given the last pages of the script until weeks before shooting and the pages that revealed the killers identity were only provided on the day the scene was shot. The short production schedule on \"Scream 2\" and his work on other projects meant that Williamson's final script used for the film was detailed in some areas but lacking in others, the intention being for Craven to fill out these scenes on set.\n\nWilliamson was approached by Bob and Harvey Weinstein in early 1999 to pen a script for \"Scream 3\" but at the time he was involved with the writing and directing of his original script \"Teaching Mrs. Tingle\" and developing the short-lived TV series \"Wasteland\". Unable to write a full script, Williamson provided a draft outline for the film that involved the filming of the film within a film \"Stab 3\", based on the previous film's in-universe murders, that took place in the fictional town of Woodsboro from the original \"Scream\". \"Arlington Road\" scribe Ehren Kruger was brought into the production by the Weinstein brothers to develop a script using Williamson's notes, though Kruger admitted that without having been involved with the characters in the previous two films he struggled to write them true to character. Early scripts by Kruger had the character of Sidney Prescott much like \"Linda Hamilton in \"Terminator 2\"\" at which point Craven would intervene to bring the character closer to previous iterations. Kruger admits that Craven had a hand in writing the script though he remained uncredited for it. Kruger's script would differ in many ways from Williamson's original including the removal of one of the killers and the inclusion of the death of Cotton Weary who was originally absent from the film. Additionally, the film's location changed from Woodsboro to Hollywood as Kruger believed that the characters should be moving to bigger places from high school, to college to Hollywood. However, there were also considerations that creating a film containing acts of murder in and around the fictional Woodsboro school would receive negative attention following the Columbine High School massacre that occurred less than a year before the film's eventual release. The film was given a greater emphasis on humor over violence and fared worse than previous installments both financially and critically.\n\nAlmost ten years after the last installment, in late 2009, Williamson formulated a concept for a new installment and approached Bob Weinstein who, after hearing his pitch, told Williamson to begin writing a script for what would become \"Scream 4\". Campbell initially refused to return to the series for \"Scream 4\" forcing early script drafts to be written in consideration of her characters absence with Cox and Arquette's characters becoming the focus. Early versions of the script involved Campbell's character being attacked and killed in the opening, a key point of contention for Weinstein who had it removed, while another version had Cox and Arquette's character as parents, but this too was removed as it was believed that them having a child would be unworkable in the context of the film. After Williamson was forced to leave the production due to contractual commitments to \"The Vampire Diaries\", under threat of legal action, controversy arose in July 2010 when \"Scream 3\" writer Ehren Kruger was brought in by Weinstein to perform re-writes on Williamson's script, about which Craven was outspoken on \"losing control\" of the story. He would later explain that despite rewrites it was still Williamson's characters and script. Weinstein clarified that Kruger was brought in to \"punch up\" the film's dialog but his involvement with the writing was not to the same extent as with \"Scream 3\". To preserve the secrecy of the script and the identity of the film's killer, the cast were only provided with 75 pages of the 140-page-long script. Like the two previous installments in the series, the script underwent rewrites often, with pages sometimes only ready on the day of shooting.\n\nThe script for \"Scream\" (1996), then known as \"Scary Movie\" was released for sale on a Friday and by 8 a.m. the following Monday had become involved in a significant bidding war from several studios, including Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures and Morgan Creek, with producer Cathy Konrad bringing it to the attention of Bob Weinstein. The bidding eventually rose to an amount that the choice ultimately came down to Oliver Stone, who was at the time working with Cinergi Pictures, and Weinstein under Miramax. Williamson agreed to terms with Miramax for $400,000 plus a contract for two sequels and a third, unrelated film, believing their label, Dimension Films, would produce \"Scream\" immediately and without significant restriction. Wes Craven was approached early on to helm the film but he was occupied with remaking \"The Haunting\" and so other directors including Robert Rodriguez, Danny Boyle, George Romero and Sam Raimi were approached. Concerns were raised by Williamson and Weinstein when many of the approached directors, having read the script, believed the film to be a comedy, making them reluctant to hire those particular directors, believing they \"didn't get it\". Craven was approached and passed on the film several times, wanting to move away from the genre, but was enticed once Drew Barrymore became involved, reasoning that it may be different from his previous works if an actress of her recognition was involved. Ultimately the production of \"The Haunting\", at that time, fell through and Craven was able to take over directing duties on the film. Close to the end of the film's production, the Weinstein brothers had the film's title changed from \"Scary Movie\" to \"Scream\" inspired by the Michael Jackson song of the same name as Bob Weinstein felt \"Scary Movie\" was not suitable when the film also contained elements of satire and comedy. The change was immediately disliked by both Williamson and Craven who considered it \"stupid\" but would later remark that it was a positive change.\n\nFollowing a successful screening with a test audience and Miramax executives, both Williamson and Craven were offered a two-picture contract for sequels to \"Scream\", Williamson already having been offered a three-picture deal by Miramax for unrelated films. Bob Weinstein ordered that the film be released on December 20, 1996, a date others were critical of as it was the Christmas season where seasonal and family films were more prevalent. Weinstein argued this fact was in the film's favor, as it meant that horror fans and teenagers had nothing interesting to watch. When \"Scream\"&apos;s first weekend takings amounted to only $6 million, it was considered that this release date gamble had failed, but the following week the takings did not drop but increased and continued the following week, leading to a total U.S. gross of over $100 million. As \"Scream\"&apos;s box-office takings grew, a lawsuit would be filed against Dimension Films by Sony Pictures who claimed that the title \"Scream\" was too similar to that of Sony's own film \"Screamers\" (1995). The case was settled out of court with the details remaining secret but producer Marianne Maddalena would confirm that the production were able to use the current and potential future titles of \"Scream 2\" and \"Scream 3\".\n\nA sequel was considered in January 1997 after the first film proceeded to gross more than $50 million in its first month. \"Scream 2\" was greenlit with a budget of $24 million, and was released before the first film's anniversary. The production of the film suffered a significant setback when the script was leaked revealing plot details including the identity of the killers, resulting in the script being modified to change many details. In an interview, Craven commented on the rushed schedule for the film, starting in July 1997 with a December release date, with many scenes in the script provided with only a loose outline forcing him to develop scenes on set. Various titles were considered for the sequel at different points in the film's production, including \"Scream Again\", \"Scream Louder\" and \"Scream: The Sequel\" before the studio decided to simply use \"Scream 2\".\n\n\"Scream 3\" (2000) was released just over two years after \"Scream 2\" with Craven again attached to direct the film on a greatly increased budget of $40 million. Shortly before production began on the film, the Columbine incident occurred and with it came an increased scrutiny on the media and its effect on people, particularly films. There were considerations at the time about whether the studio should continue production of a third installment in the aftermath of the incident but the studio decided to continue, albeit with changes. The studio was much more apprehensive concerning violence and gore in the film than with previous installments with them pressing for a greater emphasis on the series' humor while scaling back on the violence. At one point in the production, the studio demanded that the film feature no blood or on-screen violence but Craven intervened stating that the film should either have the violence present in earlier \"Scream\" films or should be called something other than \"Scream\". As with production of \"Scream\", Craven would again state in an interview that issues with censorship and the MPAA made him consider leaving the horror genre.\n\nProduction of a new film, \"Scream 4\" (2011) was announced in July 2008 by The Weinstein Company who approached Williamson about formulating a new script, with the intention of creating a new \"Scream\" trilogy if the fourth film proved successful. By late 2009, Williamson managed to develop an idea for the film and potential sequels and began work on the script. The film was given a budget of $40 million and the principal cast were signed to the film in September 2009 followed by Craven as director in March 2010. In May 2010, Cathy Konrad, producer on the original three films filed a $3 million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company accusing them of violating an agreement that her company, Cat Entertainment, be given first rights to produce all \"Scream\" films in order to cut costs by getting a cheaper producer (Craven's wife Iya Labunka, not named in the suit). In April 2011, it was reported that the Weinsteins had settled out of court with Conrad, the details remaining confidential. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" however, claimed that Conrad received a cash payment and entitlement to a percentage of the profits derived from \"Scream 4\". In addition, she was given an executive producer credit on the film. Williamson and Bob Weinstein came into repeated conflict with each other during production with Williamson citing the creative direction of the film as the cause while Weinstein blamed the time constraints on the film's development. Williamson and Weinstein did not speak to each other after Williamson left the production, claiming other responsibilities, and he had not seen the finished version of the film prior to its release.\n\nFilming for \"Scream\" began on April 15, 1996 and finished on June 8, 1996. Filming was intended to take place in North Carolina, but the location was deemed unsuitable, with scouts unable to find useful locations that would not require extensive building or modification to make fit the requirements of the film. The production instead turned to Vancouver, Washington and Los Angeles before discovering Sonoma county, California and the areas within, Santa Rosa, Healdsburg and Tomales Bay. The house used by Barrymore's character is situated on Sonoma Mountain Road opposite the house used in the horror film Cujo (1983). Before filming began, the production approached Santa Rosa High School about using it as Woodsboro High School. The school board insisted on seeing the script and objected to the content of the film's dialog and the foul-mouthed, aggressive character of Principal Himbry. The matter reached local newspapers who also raised criticism but there the production received support from students of the school and local residents who supported the economic benefits of the film's presence and others who defended its First Amendment rights. Opposition to the film came from those who deplored its content of violence against children (teenagers), as the area had suffered the tragic kidnap and murder of Polly Klaas three years prior. The matter resulted in a three-hour debate on the topic scheduled for April 16, one day after filming was to begin. Unwilling to be delayed, Craven began filming as scheduled on April 15, with the opening scene of the film featuring Barrymore which took five days to complete. The result of the Santa Rosa debate was that permission be denied and the production was forced to find another location for the school, ultimately being offered the Santa Rosa community center, which appears as Woodsboro High School in \"Scream\".\n\nFor the film's killer, Williamson's script had provided Craven only with the description \"masked killer\", forcing him and his design team to create the Ghostface costume from scratch to conceal the killer's identity. While awaiting permission from Fun World, creators of the Ghostface mask design, Craven had the design team KNB Effects create an alternative that was used in two scenes before being replaced by the original Fun World design once permission was granted. Bob Weinstein disliked the Ghostface mask, believing it was not \"scary\", and the studio, upon reviewing the dailies footage of the opening scene, were concerned that it was progressing in a direction they did not want and there was consideration that Craven could ultimately be replaced. To assuage their concerns, the first thirteen minutes of the opening scene were compiled as a workprint, a rough version of the finished film, and upon seeing it, the studio were content to let Craven continue and Weinstein was satisfied that the mask could be scary. The third and final act of the film, set at a house party, was over forty minutes long and shot at a vacant property in Tomales over twenty-one nights. The scene was considered the most difficult to shoot, as it took place entirely in one location, yet featured the individual stories and deaths of multiple characters, and as it was set at night, meant that production had to halt at daybreak.\n\nAfter filming completed in June, Craven spent two months editing the final product, encountering repeated conflicts with the film rating body MPAA concerning the content of scenes, being forced to tone down or obscure the more intense scenes and violence to avoid an NC-17. Though Dimension Films had previously released NC-17 films, the rating made those films difficult to market and attract an audience and thus they were desperate for a less restrictive R-rating. For an early scene involving the death of the character Casey Becker, Craven lied to the MPAA by claiming he had only one take of the scene and could not replace it with something less intense, in order to keep it in the film. In interviews, Craven indicated that the conflict was enough that, at the time, he was considering leaving the horror genre. In total, Craven sent eight different cuts of the film to the MPAA before Bob Weinstein intervened and personally contacted the MPAA, believing they misunderstood to which genre \"Scream\" belonged. Weinstein explained to the organisation that although he agreed it was intense, it also had comedic elements and satirized its content and was not just a horror film glorifying violence. The MPAA reviewed their decision and granted the film an R-rating.\n\nProduction of a sequel, \"Scream 2\" was greenlit in May 1997, with filming beginning on September 17, 1997 with a budget of $24 million and wrapping on October 30, 1997. Filming took place largely in Atlanta, Georgia over four weeks before moving to Los Angeles. Agnes Scott College in Atlanta and University of California, Los Angeles were used to represent the fictional Windsor College that appears in the film. The opening scene featuring the premiere of the fictional \"Stab\" film was filmed over three days in the Vista theater on Sunset Drive, Hollywood, the exterior represented by the Rialto theater in South Pasadena. Due to the large number of extras present in the scene, its details were leaked onto the Internet shortly after filming completed, which Craven cited as the productions first experience of a major plot leak. After his interactions with the MPAA in \"Scream\", Craven sent them a copy of the film that was intentionally much more graphically violent than they were planning to release, featuring Omar Epps' character being stabbed in the ear three times and an extended scene of Randy Meeks death. Their idea was that the MPAA would force them to remove the content the production already did not want while keeping the content they did. However, the MPAA gave them an R-Rating for the more violent cut, stating that they felt the message of the film was significant. Following a script leak early into filming, security around the production was significantly increased, with a focus on closed film sets and strict restriction on what personnel could be present during filming and have access to the script, and with all present required to sign non-disclosure agreements. The script was printed on specialty paper to prevent photocopying and was often destroyed after use.\n\nFilming for \"Scream 3\" began on July 6, 1999 in and around Hollywood, Los Angeles, in the areas of San Fernando Valley, Macarthur Park, Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills and Silverlake, with a $40 million budget and wrapped on September 29, 1999. The isolated home of Campbell's character is situated in Topanga Canyon and Cox's character is introduced in a classroom at UCLA. A scene where Campbell's character is pursued through movie set replicas of locations from \"Scream\" was not scripted but the sets were built because Craven knew he wanted to revisit the original film in some way, after which they wrote the scene around the set. Due to the constantly changing script used for the film, which would often be usable on the day of filming, the production filmed large amounts of footage of different variations of the same scenes in order that, should the script again change, they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date. In particular, the opening scene had three variants and the three-minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had two-hours of filmed footage. The ending too was refilmed in January 2000, three months after principal photography finished, adding in the character of Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) and having Campbell's character beaten and then shot by Ghostface after it was decided she defeated him too easily. So in flux was the script that the final scene of the movie was filmed with three variants of Dempsey's character, one with him absent, one with his arm in bandages and one with him in a normal condition as they were unsure of what his fate would be.\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Scream 4\" began on June 28, 2010 with a budget of $40 million and concluded on September 24, 2010. Filming took place in Michigan in the areas of Ann Arbor, Dearborn, Livonia and Northville. In January 2011, the film underwent an additional four days of filming to reshoot two scenes, following a test screening – the opening scene and a later scene that took place in a parking garage with Alison Brie. Amidst criticism that the reshoots meant the film was in trouble and the result of a negative response from the test audience, director Craven countered,\nCraven also complimented the film's ending, labeling it \"kick-ass\" and stated that it remained untouched as part of the reshoot process. In an interview, Craven also highlighted that the script was so long they had filmed many scenes which had to be cut from the final film to reduce its running time.\n\nThe score for the \"Scream\" series was provided by Marco Beltrami, starting with \"Scream\" in what was his feature film debut. Beltrami was brought onto the production of \"Scream\" after Craven's assistant Julie Plec requested input on the now defunct site \"Hollywood Cafe\", asking for opinions on was \"new\", \"fresh\" and \"wonderful\" and was provided with Beltrami's name by several people. Craven sent for samples of Beltrami's work and was impressed by what he heard, bringing him to the set to view the first thirteen minutes of the film featuring the introduction and murder of the character Casey Becker. Craven had Beltrami produce music based on this scene and then demonstrate it, impressing Craven enough to hire him. For \"Scream\" (1996), the decision was made to intentionally use music to raise the tension in scenes where it was unnecessary when the characters were entering a situation where the audience may expect a killer to suddenly appear, only to not deliver on that expectation, part of the film's theme of playing with horror conventions. Craven and editor Patrick Lussier provided Beltrami with advice on how best to deliver the music during scary and tense scenes as Beltrami had no prior experience in developing a horror score. Beltrami intentionally avoided conventional horror score styles and approached the film as a western, taking influence from Ennio Morricone, prolific composer of many western films, in the creation of \"Scream\"&apos;s music. When scoring a theme for the character of Dewey, Beltrami approached him as a sheriff but also as a \"quirky\" character, using a Morricone-style guitar accompaniment to maintain the Western approach. An acoustic cover of Blue Öyster Cult's \"Don't Fear the Reaper\" plays softly in the background to Sidney and Billy's discussion of their relationship, which analyst Jeff Smith describes as\n\nThe theme tune of Sidney Prescott, entitled \"Sidney's Lament\", became a signature track for the series, variations of the tune appearing across the score of \"Scream\", \"Scream 2\" and \"Scream 3\". The track features a female choral arrangement expressing \"sorrow\" concerning the fate of the character. In \"Scream\", Beltrami stated that the voice \"spoke\" for the character, \"lamenting\" the loss of her mother. In future films it went on to represent the murders and ensuing trauma inflicted on her. Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks called the \"haunting\" vocals of the track the \"voice of the franchise\". The track \"Sid Wears a Dress\" features in the finale of \"Scream 3\" where the sorrowful chorus of \"Lament\" gradually shifts key to represent \"hope\" for the characters future following the resolution of her storyline in what was then the final film in the series. The female voice would be accompanied by a male addition for the first time in \"Pied a Terror\" from \"Scream 3\" to represent the brother of the character.\n\nBeltrami returned for \"Scream 2\" (1998), leading the score though there would be a late inclusion by Danny Elfman in the form of the choral track \"Cassandra Aria\". In addition, excerpts from the score of \"Broken Arrow\" by Hans Zimmer appeared in the film, in particular guitar work by Duane Eddy, for the character 'Dewey', replacing many of the character's related tracks from the original \"Scream\" score. Beltrami later explained that the Zimmer piece was used as a scratch track for test screening purposes before the score was finalized. The test audience reaction to it influenced the studio keep the Zimmer piece, reducing \"Dewey's Theme\", which Beltrami had composed to fill its place, to minor use during more serious scenes involving the character. The Zimmer piece would continue to be used in \"Scream 3\" during scenes concerning the evolving relationship between the characters of Dewey and Gale with Beltrami appropriating and adding his own influence to the piece to blend it into the thematic \"Scream 3\" score.\n\nFor \"Scream 3\", Beltrami employed seven orchestrators to aid in scoring the extensive orchestral accompaniment featured in the film's score. Additionally, he experimented with new styles of sound production by recording instruments in abnormal circumstances such as inserting objects into a piano and recording at various velocities to create a distorted, unnatural sound and modifying the results electronically.\n\nThe \"Scream\" series, when compared to the other high-grossing American horror franchises – \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", \"Chucky\", \"Friday the 13th\", \"Halloween\", the Hannibal Lecter series, \"Hellraiser\", \"Psycho\", \"Saw\", \"The Exorcist\", and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" — with figures adjusted for 2011 inflation, is the sixth highest grossing horror franchise in the domestic United States at $442.9 million. This list is topped by \"Friday the 13th\" at $687.1 million, followed by the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" series with $592.8 million. The Hannibal Lecter film series with $588.7 million, \"Halloween\" with $557.5 million, the \"Saw\" series with $457.4 million, the \"Scream\" series which is followed by \"Psycho\" with $376.3 million, \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" with $304.6 million, and the \"Chucky\" film series with approximately $203 million.\n\nThe original \"Scream\" has remained the most successful of the series accruing a US$173,046,663 gross worldwide and receiving a largely positive critical reception, closely followed by \"Scream 2\" with less than $1 million separating their respective box-office takings. \"Scream 3\" suffered significantly worse domestically and critically than its predecessors, taking only $89.1 million compared to \"Scream\" and \"Scream 2\" with $103 million and $101.1 million respectively. All three installments takings remained relatively equal in other territories with less than $2 million separating them, however Scream 3 remains the lowest financially performing series entry to date. \"Scream\" is currently the 518th highest-grossing movie worldwide, followed by \"Scream 2\" at 520 and \"Scream 3\" at 616. As of 2011, \"Scream\" remains the highest-grossing film in the slasher genre, followed by \"Scream 2\" and \"Scream 3\" at No. 2 and No. 3 respectively.\n\nDespite competition from other big name films during its release, including Tom Cruise's \"Jerry Maguire\" and Tim Burton's \"Mars Attacks!\", its release date of December 20, during the Christmas season, and Variety labeling it \"D.O.A.\" before it was even released, \"Scream\" became the surprise hit of the year and continued to show in cinemas for nearly eight months. By late 1998, \"Scream 2\" broke February opening weekend records for its box-office takings in 1998 and held the record until December 15, 2000, being replaced by \"What Women Want\" (2000).\n\nWhen adjusted for 2012 inflation, the entire \"Scream\" franchise has grossed $816,420,621 worldwide.\n\nThe \"Scream\" series has received a largely positive critical response since the release of the first film in 1996 with Kevin Thomas of \"The Los Angeles Times\" calling \"Scream\" \"a bravura, provocative sendup of horror pictures\" while \"Empire\"&apos;s Adam Smith called it \"Clever, quick and bloody funny.\" Other reviews appreciated the shift from the teen slasher films of the 1980s and their \"endless series of laborious, half-baked sequels.\" Williamson's script received praise for its \"fiendishly clever, complicated plot\" which \"deftly mixes irony, self-reference and wry social commentary with chills and blood spills.\" Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" was less complimentary saying \"[Craven] wants things both ways, capitalizing on lurid material while undermining it with mocking humor. Not even horror fans who can answer all this film's knowing trivia questions may be fully comfortable with such an exploitative mix\".\n\n\"Scream\" went on to rank No. 32 on \"Entertainment Weekly\"&apos;s list of the '50 Best High School Movies and No. 13 on Bravo's 'The 100 Scariest Movie Movements'. In 2008, \"Entertainment Weekly\" would add additional praise to the film, listing it as No. 60 on their list of the '100 Best Films of the Last 13 years'. The film ranked No. 482 on \"Empire\"&apos;s 2008 list of 'The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time'. \"Scream\" received several awards in 1996 including the Saturn Award's Best Actress for Campbell, Best Writing for Kevin Williamson and Best Horror Film plus nominations for Best Director for Wes Craven and Best Supporting Actor for both Ulrich and Barrymore. The film was also awarded the 1997 Best Movie by the MTV Movie Awards.\n\n\"Scream 2\" received equally positive critical response with some critics arguing that the film surpassed the original in scares and humor. Both Gene Siskel and the \"New York Times\"&apos; Janet Maslin gave the sequel positive reviews despite their negative response to \"Scream\". The film failed to achieve the same success as the original in terms of awards however, winning only the 1998 MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance for Campbell plus Saturn Award nominations for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Horror Film for Campbell, Cox and \"Scream 2\" respectively.\n\n\"Scream 3\" received mostly negative reviews, receiving an aggregated score of 36% on review-site Rotten Tomatoes compared to \"Scream\"&apos;s 83% and \"Scream 2\"&apos;s 81% with general consensus that \"\"Scream 3\" became what the series originally started out spoofing\" and concluded that the series \"lost its freshness and originality by falling back on the old horror formulas and clichés\". Of the characters, Roger Ebert said \"[the characters] are so thin, they're transparent\" but praised Campbell's appearance saying \"The camera loves her. She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute\". Not all reviews were negative, Kevin Thomas at the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"Genuinely scary and also highly amusing\" and Tom Coates at the BBC stated that \"as the conclusion to the trilogy it works more effectively than anyone had a right to expect\".\n\n\"Scream 4\" received mixed reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 59% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 169 reviews, with an average score of 5.8 out of 10. Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a 52 based on 32 reviews. CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a B minus on an A plus to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, criticizing the film for using the clichéd formula of the slasher genre. Michael O'Sullivan of \"The Washington Post\" gave the film a negative rating of one and half out of four stars saying \"the problem is, the movie doesn't really care if we are laughing with it or at it\". \"Empire\" gave the film two out of five stars, criticizing the film's old-fashioned formula and lack of scare factor. \"The New York Daily News\" thought the film was \"dated\" and that \"relying on obvious clichés doesn't seem ironic anymore, just easy.\" The \"Toronto Sun\" gave the film a mixed review, writing that \"this installment is nowhere near the hip, serrated-edge blast of newness the original was in 1996. Suddenly, it's the horror thriller that, like, your parents are excited about\"; however, the review praised director Wes Craven. Colin Covert of the \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\" gave the film a perfect score of four out of four stars, praising the combination of scares, comedy, and twists.\nThe \"Boston Herald\" wrote that the film is \"often amusing\" but too long. Lisa Kennedy from \"The Denver Post\" stated that \"Scream 4\" \"pays plenty of homage to their 1996 original\", but that it is not close to its greatness. Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised the film, stating \"It's a giddy reminder of everything that made \"Scream\" such a fresh scream in the first place,\" while Betsy Sharkey of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"\"Scream 4\" finds a way to live up to its gory past while it carves out new terrors in new ways.\" Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" gave the movie two out of four stars, criticizing the comedic overtones. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the film four out of five stars stating, \"The first film is still the best, but this is much more in line with (and perhaps even better than) the fun of \"Scream 2\" and the drab \"Scream 3\". \"Scream 4\"&apos;s conclusion also works as a strong series ender.\"\n\n\"Scream\" was released in US territories on VHS on December 2, 1997, followed by \"Scream 2\" on December 1, 1998 and \"Scream 3\" on October 24, 2000. All releases were conducted by Buena Vista Home Entertainment which, by the time of \"Scream 3\"&apos;s release, had become known as Walt Disney Home Entertainment.\n\nThe \"Scream\" films were released on DVD for the first time on December 3, 1997 starting with \"Scream\". with a Collector's Edition of the film released on December 8, 1998, containing the film as well as deleted scenes, outtakes, the film's theatrical trailer, cast interviews, directors commentary and behind the scenes information. \"Scream 2\" was released in the US on July 22, 1998 with a Collector's Edition following on August 7, 2001. The Collector's Edition featured additional material including outtakes, deleted scenes, the film's theatrical trailer, music videos of songs featured in the film and directors' commentary. \"Scream 3\" was released in the US on July 4, 2000 only as a Collector's Edition featuring deleted scenes, outtakes, audio commentary, music videos of songs featured in the film, trailers for the film and biographies on the cast and crew involved in the film's production. In 2001, the \"Scream 3\" release was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Home Video Release, losing to \"Princess Mononoke\" (1997). All of the US releases were undertaken by Buena Vista Home Entertainment which, by the time of \"Scream 3\"&apos;s release, had become known as Walt Disney Home Entertainment.\n\nFollowing the release of, then series finale, \"Scream 3\", the three films were collected in \"The Ultimate Scream Collection\" by Dimension Films on September 26, 2000, in a boxset containing \"Scream\", \"Scream 2\" and \"Scream 3\" plus \"Behind the Scream\" a short documentary about the production of the three films and additional material including screentests of actors involved in the films, outtakes and deleted scenes.\n\n\"Scream\", \"Scream 2\" and \"Scream 3\" remained unreleased in foreign territories including Europe and Japan until 2001 where they were simultaneously released on February 26 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Each film contained the additional content found in the Collector's Edition version of their US release including deleted scenes, outtakes, theatrical trailers, music videos and commentary from each respective film's crew. Additionally, the three films were collected together in a single pack, again released on February 26 and released as \"Scream Trilogy\".\n\nThe three original films were released individually and in a collection in Blu-ray Disc format on March 29, 2011, two weeks prior to the release of \"Scream 4\", by Lionsgate Home Entertainment, hosting the films in 1080p high definition. In addition to the films, each release contained audio commentary, theatrical trailers and behind-the-scenes footage for each respective film.\n\nThe \"Scream\" original soundtrack, released December 17, 1996 by the label TVT Records, features 12 songs by various artists including the original piece \"Trouble in Woodsboro\"/\"Sidney's Lament\" from the film's score by Marco Beltrami, most of which appeared in various scenes in the film. The piece \"School's Out\" by Alice Cooper appeared in the film but was replaced with a cover version of the song by The Last Hard Men on the album. The album was given 3 out of 5 stars by Allmusic though it was considered a failure and never charted on the \"Billboard\" 200 despite the success of the film.\n\nThe \"Scream\" score by Marco Beltrami would be his first time scoring a major film release and the ensuing exposure allowed him to go on to score other blockbuster films such as \"I, Robot\" and \"Live Free or Die Hard\". The score would not be released commercially until July 14, 1998 by Varèse Sarabande in a dual-pack with the \"Scream 2\" score. However it was found to lack several pieces from the films, with a runtime of only 12 minutes compared to the more common 30–45 minutes normally found in original scores due to the high reuse fees involved in obtaining the rights to commercially release the music. Beltrami was considered to have taken inspiration from the synthetic styles of Éric Serra and other successful scores, the references becoming more pronounced in his score to \"Scream 2\". The theme for the central character Sidney Prescott, \"Sidney's Lament\" incorporated a \"haunting\" female solo vocal that would be utilized in other tracks throughout the entire film series. The score to \"Scream\" received generally positive reviews with Mikael Carlsson labeling it as some of the most intriguing horror scores composed in years while Filmtracks claimed the scores had \"cult status\".\n\nThe \"Scream 2\" original soundtrack was released December 2, 1997, by Capitol Records featuring 15 songs in the R&B, rap and rock genres by various artists, some of which are represented in the film. The album spent ten weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200, rising as high as No. 50 but received a lower score than its predecessor from the music guide Allmusic, gaining only 2 out of 5. Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic opined that the soundtrack was an attempt to compensate for the previous film's lack of a hit soundtrack, but failed to do, creating an \"uneven\" album of songs not \"good enough to make [the artists'] own albums\".\n\nThe \"Scream 2\" score was, as in \"Scream\", developed by Marco Beltrami and was released on July 14, 1998 in a dual-pack with the score to \"Scream\" by Varèse Sarabande. The commercially released score was found to be lacking several pieces used in the film, with a runtime of only 17 minutes compared to the more common 30–45 minutes normally found in original scores. Included in the missing pieces was the track \"Cassandra Aria\" created by Danny Elfman, described by soundtrack-review site Filmtracks as \"a frenzied, choral-enhanced three minutes\" that remains unreleased . The length of the released score was considered disappointing and blamed on the fees required to be paid to musicians in order to release their music. The influence of several other famous composers could be heard in the score including Hans Zimmer, Elliot Goldenthal, Ennio Morricone and Christopher Young. In particular excerpts of the Hans Zimmer's score to \"Broken Arrow\", featuring guitar by Duane Eddy, would become a component of the theme tune of the character Dewey Riley.\n\nThe \"Scream 3\" original soundtrack was released on January 25, 2000 by Wind-up Records featuring 18 songs consisting largely of the metal genre by artists such as System of a Down and Powerman 5000, some of which are represented in the film. The album fared better than its predecessors, spending fourteen weeks on the \"Billboard\" 200 and reaching a top rank of #32. and scoring a 2.5 out of 5 from music guide Allmusic. Reviewer Steve Huey claims that the \"high pedigree\" of the albums contributors had produced a \"pretty listenable album\".\n\nThe \"Scream 3\" score was again helmed by Marco Beltrami who employed seven orchestrators and experimented with the recording of instruments in unusual circumstances such as physically and electronically altering the traditional sound of a piano while continuing to include a heavy vocal orchestra in his tracks There was consideration that Beltrami was forced to hire multiple orchestrators to complete the score to meet the film's deadline. Like previous scores in the series, the \"Scream 3\" score was released by Varèse Sarabande on February 29, 2000 with a total length of 33 minutes of music, though the album was again found to be missing certain sections of the score utilized within the film. Beltrami took inspiration from other composers for the score, again incorporating excerpts of the score to \"Broken Arrow\" by Hans Zimmer in the track \"Sid Wears a Dress\". Music guide Allmusic awarded the \"Scream 3\" score 2.5 out of 5.\n\nThe \"Scream 4: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" was released on April 12, 2011 by Lakeshore Records. The soundtrack features 12 songs performed by various artists mainly of the rock genre, such as Ida Maria, The Sounds and The Novocaines. The soundtrack received mixed reactions, with Gotham News stating that \"This new album attempts to retain the style of the old, while speaking to the present content-diluted market. It has some success, but no cigar.\" Shadowlocked criticized the soundtrack's overly light tone, saying that \"There's little here that I would have picked for a horror movie.\"\n\nA score soundtrack was also released, on April 19, 2011 by Varèse Sarabande. The \"Scream 4\" score was yet again developed by Marco Beltrami. It received mixed reviews. Filmtracks stating that \"Despite the memorable history Beltrami has afforded the franchise musically, Scream 4 is a substantially disappointing continuation of the narrative. He and four assistant composers handle the 2011 entry from a purely functional stance, tackling individual scenes with stylistic remnants of the previous scores while accomplishing absolutely nothing new.\" Soundtrack-review site Sountrackgeek gave the score a highly favorable review: \"It is possibly the best score in the Scream series, because it is so incredibly forceful. It wants to be full of action and chills and it is. It's not the scariest of scores, but Scream has never been about the moody scares, but rather the surprise scare and crazy fight/chase scenes. It succeeds and I had a blast listening to this from start to finish.\"\n\nAmidst the series' success, it has also been tinged with controversy with claims of real-world copycat crime inspirations and inducing violence.\n\nIn January 1998, 16-year-old Mario Padilla and his 14-year-old cousin, Samuel Ramirez stabbed Mario's mother, Gina Castillo, 45 times, killing her. The case became known as the \"\"Scream\" murder\" and fell under intense media scrutiny after the boys claimed they were inspired by \"Scream\" and \"Scream 2\". They would also admit to needing the money acquired from Gina's murder to fund a killing spree and purchase two Ghostface costumes and a voice-changer used by the character in the film. During their trial, psychologist, Madeline Levine, who studied the effect of violence on children, stated\n\nThe case was expected to highlight the effect of violent films on teenagers but the presiding judge, John Cheroske, ordered that evidence pertaining to \"Scream\" be barred and that the case not be referred to as the \"\"Scream\" murder\", refusing media access to the courtroom, intending that the case was tried as murder and nothing else.\n\nOn January 17, 1999, 13-year-old Ashley Murray was stabbed multiple times in the head and back before being left for dead by his then-friends Daniel Gill, 14, and Robert Fuller, 15; he was later found and saved by an elderly man walking his dog. The pair were dubbed the \"\"Scream\" attackers\" after it emerged that they had watched \"Scream\" shortly before the attack and drawings of the Ghostface mask were found amongst their possessions, though their actions were additionally blamed on physical abuse, drugs and exposure to black magic in their home life. Murray, who later testified against the pair, himself stated that he believed the film may have influenced the pair to attack him.\n\nOn May 4, 1999, following the Columbine incident and increasing news media scrutiny on the effects on society of violence in films, games and other media, the United States Senate Commerce committee held a hearing about Hollywood's marketing of films to youths and the horror genre of films in particular, using the opening scene of \"Scream\" featuring the murder of Casey Becker, as an example of negative media which may be viewed by children.\n\nIn November 2001, Belgian Thierry Jaradin, 24, garbed in a Ghostface mask and costume murdered 15-year-old Alisson Cambier after she rejected his romantic advances. Jaradin later claimed to police that the murder was premeditated and inspired by the \"Scream\" film trilogy. The following year a seventeen-year-old French youth, identified only as Julien, following prior failed attempts with other girls, lured a fellow pupil to a secluded spot and stabbed her to death after showing her his Ghostface mask. French authorities of the time claimed the murder as the third \"Scream\" related killing since 2000.\n\n"}

The earliest references to it date from the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). The (111 CE) \"Book of Han\" bibliography section (\"Yiwenzhi\" ) has a list of Warring States period (475-221 BCE) texts including the \"Shiben\" in 15 volumes (\"pian\"). The (5th century) \"Book of the Later Han\" says Sima Qian used the text as a source for his (109 BCE) \"Records of the Grand Historian\" (Needham and Wang 1954: 52). Several Han scholars wrote commentaries to the \"Shiben\", namely Liu Xiang (77-6 BCE), Song Jun 宋均 (d. 76 CE), Ying Shao (140-206), and Song Zhong 宋衷 (fl. 192-210), which was the most widely copied in later editions. \n\nThe bibliography sections of the standard \"Twenty-Four Histories\" list various \"Shiben\" versions from the Han up through the Tang dynasty (618-907), but it was lost at the beginning of the Song dynasty (960-1279). During the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), scholars collected \"Shiben\" fragments and compiled eight different versions, which were published together (Commercial Press 1957). The eight compilers were Wang Mo, Sun Fengyi 孫馮翼, Chen Qirong 陳其榮, Qin Jiamo 秦嘉謨, Zhang Shu 張澎, Lei Xueqi 雷學淇. Mao Palin 茆泮林, and Wang Zicai 王梓材. With the exception of Wang Zicai's version that rearranged the text in chronological order, the others all have three similar chapters (\"pian\") on \"Shixing\" 氏姓 \"Clan names\", \"Ju\" 居 \"Residences [of Rulers]\", and \"Zuo\" 作 \"Inventors\"; but different arrangements of noble genealogies.\n\nThe \"Shiben\" was the oldest book in the Chinese literary genre of books that record inventions and discoveries, called \"technological dictionaries\" (Needham and Wang 1954: 51), \"dictionaries of origins\" or \"encyclopedias of origins\" (Needham et al. 1986: 212-213). These Chinese reference works were important to the study of natural history.\nThis was the genre of lexical works devoted entirely to explaining the origins of things, inventions, customs and affairs—very characteristic of Chinese literature but liable to be puzzling to any Westerners who still cherish the illusion that that civilisation was 'timeless' and 'static'. In fact, it was historical to the core, conscious also of a kind of social evolution from primitive existence, and therefore very much concerned with origins. (Needham et al. 1986: 212) \nThe Sui dynasty mathematician Liu Xiaosun 劉孝孫 (fl. 605-616) wrote the \"Shishi\" 事始 \"Beginning of all Affairs\", which contains some 335 entries with names of various material things and devices. It was followed by the (c. 960) \"Xushishi\" 續事始 \"Continued Beginning of all Affairs\" by the Former Shu dynasty scholar Ma Jian 馬鑑, with 358 entries. Both of these books refer to Chinese legendary inventors (Needham and Wang 1954:52). Later encyclopedias of origins in this genre were much larger. Two from the Song dynasty were the (1085) \"Shiwu jiyuan\" 事物紀原 \"Records of the Origins of Affairs and Things\" compiled by Gao Cheng 高承, and the (1237) \"Gujin yuanliu zhilun\" 古今源流至論 \"Essays on the Course of Things from Antiquity to the Present Time\", which was started by Lin Dong 林駧 and completed by Huang Lüweng 黃履翁. The Qing dynasty scholar Chen Yuanlong 陳元龍 produced the largest encyclopedia of origins, the (1735) \"Gezhi jingyuan\" 格致鏡元 \"Mirror of Scientific and Technological Origins\" (Needham et al. 1986: 213). \n\nModern researchers continue to use information from the ancient \"Shiben\". For instance, Chinese \"zupu\" \"genealogy books\" cite information from its elaborate genealogies of the ruling houses and the origins of clan names. \n\nThe early history of science and technology in China regularly cites \"Shiben\" records about names of the legendary, semi-legendary, and historical inventors of all kinds of devices, instruments, and machines. The textual entries for naming inventors are mostly gnomic 4-character lines, for instance (Needham and Wang 1954: 51), \"Bo Yi zuojing\" 伯益作井 \"Bo Yi invented well(-digging)\" [to help control the Great Flood]; \"Hu Cao zuoyi\" 胡曹作衣 \"Hu Cao invented clothing\"; and \"Li Shou zuoshu\" 隸首作數 \"Li Shou invented computations\". Since many of these inventors were allegedly ministers of the legendary Yellow Emperor, the value of the \"Shiben\" is not for the actual history of science, but for the systematization that it brings to the body of legendary technological lore (Needham and Wang 1954: 51).\n\nThe famous Chinese inventor Lu Ban or Gongshu Pan (507–440 BCE) and the rotary hand quern provides a good example. The \"Shiben\" says \"Gongshu zuo shiwei\" 公輸作石磑 \"Gongshu invented the stone (rotary) mill\". The (1725) \"Gujin Tushu Jicheng\" encyclopedia glosses this with a commentary from the \"Shihwu zhiyuan\" encyclopedia or origins (above).\nHe made a plaiting of bamboo which he filled with clay (\"ni\" 泥), to decorticate grain and produce hulled rice; this was called \"wei\" 磑 (actually \"long\" 礱). He also chiseled out stones which he placed one on top of the other, to grind hulled rice and wheat to produce flour; this was called \"mo\" (磨). Both originated in the Chou time. (tr. Needham and Wang 1965: 189) \n\n\n"}

{"id": "19437997", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19437997", "title": "Teachings of the Báb", "text": "Teachings of the Báb\n\nThe teachings of the Báb refer to the teachings of Siyyid `Alí Muḥammad who was the founder of Bábism, and one of three central figures of the Bahá'í Faith. He was a merchant from Shíráz, Persia, who at the age of twenty-four (on 23 May 1844) claimed to be the promised Qá'im (or Mahdi). After his declaration he took the title of \"Báb\" meaning \"Gate\". He composed hundreds of letters and books (often termed \"tablets\") in which he stated his messianic claims and defined his teachings, which constituted a new \"sharí'ah\" or religious law. His movement eventually acquired tens of thousands of supporters, was virulently opposed by Iran's Shi'a clergy, and was suppressed by the Iranian government leading to thousands of his followers, termed Bábís, being persecuted and killed. In 1850 the Báb was shot by a firing squad in Tabríz.\n\nThe teachings of the Báb can be grouped into three broad stages which each have a dominant thematic focus. His earliest teachings are primarily defined by his interpretation of the Qur'an and other Islamic traditions. While this interpretive mode continues throughout all three stages of his teachings, a shift takes place where his emphasis moves to legislative pronouncements and to philosophical elucidation. In the philosophical stage, the Báb gives an explanation of the metaphysics of being and creation, and in the legislative stage his mystical and historical principles are explicitly united.\n\nAn analysis of the Báb's writings throughout the three stages shows that all of his teachings were animated by a common principle that had multiple dimensions and forms.\n\nIn his earliest years the Báb focused on explanations and commentaries on verses of the Qur'an, and on the teachings that represent \"true Islam\" \"until the day of resurrection\". During this time, while many Islamic injunctions remained in force in his writings, the Báb claimed that he had the authority to clarify issues relating to the details of Islamic Sharia. He used this genre against the grain of the established tradition, and he interpreted Islamic texts and traditions to transform, reverse and redefine the conventional meanings. For example, he tended to diverge from standard Muslim practices by making requirements stricter, such as enjoining additional prayers. Discussion of Shí'í millenarian themes were also an important part of the early works and gave his movement an apocalyptic edge; this was the day of the return of the Mahdi, of the victory and dominion of God. They gave the Bábí movement a widespread popular appeal.\n\nHis works frequently quoted and provided commentary on passages from the Qur'an. Unlike classical Qur'anic commentaries by theologians or Sufis, however, he usually commented on the meaning of the text letter by letter rather than the meanings of the words and sentences, allowing him to use a sacred text as a point of departure for revelation on a theme distantly related or even unrelated to the Qur'anic passage. The Báb's overall approach to texts and many Islamic doctrines was symbolic and metaphorical, and he often rejected literal interpretations of apocalyptic doctrines. While he sometimes used Sufi terminology, his reasoning and approach are distinct from any other school of thought. The Báb taught that the realm of language, as well as all other aspects of phenomenal reality, including natural and cultural objects were symbolic of a deeper spiritual meaning. He taught that everything that exists in the world is a sign that proclaims the sovereignty of God. In this way, reality is a type of language that consists of words and letters that celebrate the divine revelation in all things.\n\nThe Báb's early doctrines started to change in 1848 when he abrogated Islamic shari'ah law. The Bábí shari'ah included its own form of pilgrimage to the Báb's house in Shiraz. A Bábí calendar of nineteen months of nineteen days was defined that started on Persian Naw-Ruz and included a four-day intercalary period (to raise the total days to 365, 19 times 19 being only 361). The last 19-day month, falling in March, was the Bábí month of fasting. Bábí obligatory prayer was different from Muslim practice as well, but was deemphasized compared to dhikr, repetition of various scriptural verses. Laws regulating marriage discouraged polygamy, forbade concubinage, and instituted a year of waiting before a divorce could be completed. Such laws, and the removal of any explicit need for women to veil themselves, potentially improved the status of women to a considerable degree. The Báb, however, never explicitly delineated a principle of equality of the sexes, and other regulations continued the separation of the sexes in public.\n\nThe themes of jihad and martyrdom also remained important in the Báb's writings. The Báb often wrote theoretically about jihad in the sense of armed struggle, but he never explicitly announced the beginning of a jihad, and he completely undermines the concept of jihad by defining holy war in a way as to make it contingent on impossible conditions, thus nullifying it. The various Bábí struggles appear to have primarily involved defensive jihad. Martyrdom, an immensely important theme in Shí'ism, was important to Bábís as well, with the siege of the Bábí fort at Shaykh Tabarsí being viewed as a Bábí recapitulation of the events of Karbila. Hundreds of individual Bábís were martyred in public, usually in ways that inspired admiration or even allegiance to their cause.\n\nSeveral of the Báb's writings following his return to Chiriq in August 1848 to his execution in July 1850, such as the Kitáb-i-Asmá', discussed ritual practices largely unrelated to the actual circumstances of the Bábí community. The Báb's writings also contained many codified chronograms, cabalistic interpretations, talismanic figures, astrological tables, and numerical calculations, some of which appear to be similar to the Nuqtavi cabalistic symbolism. The number 19 appears in many parts of the Báb's writings, which also resembles Nuqtavi documents. While some elements found in the Nuqtavi school are confirmed in the writings of the Báb, the literal emphasis that the Nuqtavi school placed on letters as direct elements of divine creation are foreign to the Báb's teachings; his teachings have little to do with the issue of the actual letters or their literal divine character, but instead, concern a mystical world view where the sacred character of human beings is the image of God.\n\nThe Báb also developed legal principles that were intended to be implemented in a theocratic Bábí state if He whom God shall make manifest approved and implemented them. The rules of this state included the burning of non-Bábí books and the banning of non-Bábís from residence within its boundaries.\n\nIn his later writings the Báb described the divine or eternal essence to be unknowable, indescribable and inaccessible. The Báb compared the divine to the sun which remains single, although it appears under different names and forms in the persons, prophets, whom it is in manifested in. Some of these teachings exhibit features common to earlier Shite sects such as the Ismailis and the Hurufis. However, his teaching on the need for successive \"prophetic cycles\" is completely an original conception. He also reinterpreted Shí'í eschatological terms, such as \"resurrection\", \"Judgment Day\", and \"paradise\" and \"hell\". He stated that \"Resurrection\" means the appearance of a new revelation, and that \"raising of the dead\" refers to the spiritual awakening of those who have stepped away from true religion. He further stated that \"Judgment Day\" alludes to the time a new Manifestation of God comes, and his acceptance or rejection by the Earth's inhabitants. Thus the Báb taught that with his revelation the end times had come and the age of resurrection had started, and that the end-times were symbolic as the end of the past prophetic cycle. Traditional Shí'í millenarian beliefs were reinterpreted so radically that few of the popular traditional expectations were left. Another constant theme in his works, especially in the Persian Bayán, is that of He whom God shall make manifest: a messianic figure who would come after him. Bábís were exhorted to leave a chair for him at all gatherings and constantly to be prepared to accept him.\n"}

{"id": "1858465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858465", "title": "The Book of Giants", "text": "The Book of Giants\n\nThe Book of Giants is an apocryphal Jewish book which expands a narrative in the Hebrew Bible. Its discovery at Qumran dates the text's creation to before the 2nd century BC.\n\nThe \"Book of Giants\" is an antediluvian (pre-flood) narrative that was received primarily in Manichaean literature and known at Turpan. However, the earliest known traditions for the book originate in Aramaic copies of a \"Book of Giants\" in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Furthermore, references are found in: Genesis 6:1-4, 1 Enoch, and visions in Daniel 7:9-14. This book tells of the background and fate of these Nephilim in the flood.\n\nThe Book of Giants has long been known as a work which circulated among the Manichaeans as a composition attributed to Mani. During the twentieth century a number of finds shed considerable light on the literary evidence for the Book of Giants. The discoveries and publications of Manichaean fragments from the Book of Giants discovered at Turfan have substantiated the many references to its circulation among, and use by the Manichaens. Further identification of the Manichaean Book of Giants was revealed in 1971 when J.T. Milik discovered several Aramaic fragments of Enochic works among the Dead Sea Scrolls. These fragmentary scrolls were the primary source utilized by Mani in the compilation of his book and confirmed the Book of Giants as an independent composition from the second temple period. \n\nAmong the fragments discovered at Qumran, ten manuscripts of the \"Book of Giants\" are identified by Stuckenbruck. These fragments (1Q23 , 1Q24 , 2Q26 , 4Q203 , 4Q530 , 4Q531 , 4Q532 , 4Q556 , 4Q206 , and 6Q8 ) were found in caves 1, 2, 4, and 6 at the site. These discoveries led to further classification of the Enochic works. In the third group of classification, ten Aramaic manuscripts contain parts of the \"Book of Giants\" which were only known through the Manichaean sources until the recognition of it at Qumran.\n\nThere has been much speculation regarding the original language of the Book of Giants. It was generally believed to have had a Semitic origin. Indeed, the discovery of this text in Qumran has led scholars to believe that the book was initially composed in Aramaic.\n\n\"The Book of Giants\" comprises a group of Aramaic fragments. Because of the fragmentation of the \"Book of Giants\", it is difficult to know the order of the content. This work is related to the 1 Enoch analogue, which tells a story of the giants that is far more elaborate. Further, the Qumran Book of Giants bore resemblance to the Manichaean \"Book of Giants\" that followed after it. \n\n\"The Book of Giants\" is an expansive narrative of the biblical story of the birth of giants in Genesis 6.1-4. In this story, the giants came into being when the sons of God had sexual intercourse with mortal women who birthed a hybrid race of giants. These giants partook in destructive and immoral actions, which devastated humanity. When Enoch heard of this, he was distressed and asked God to bring judgement to the giants. In his mercy, God chose to give the giants a chance to repent by transmitting dreams to two giants named Ohyah and Hahyah who relayed the dreams to an assembly of giants. The giants were perplexed with the dreams, so they sent a giant named Mahaway to Enoch’s abode. Enoch interceded on their behalf and gave tablets to the giants with the meaning of the dreams and God’s future judgment. When the giants heard this, many chose to act in defiance to God. While the Qumran fragments were incomplete at this point, the Manichaean fragments tell of the hosts of God subduing the race of giants through battle.\n\nMost of the content in the Book of Giants is derived out of 1 Enoch 7:3-6 . This passage sheds light on the characterizing features of the Giants. It reveals that the Giants were born of the sons of god and daughters of man. The giants began to devour the works of men and went on to kill and consume them. They also sinned against the birds and beasts of the sky, creeping things and the fish of the sea. It also mentions that the giants devoured the flesh of one another and they drank the blood. [7] This act of drinking blood would have horrified the people.[8]There is further evidence of this in Leviticus 17:10-16. In this passage there are strict rules regarding the blood of the animal. In verse 10 and 11, it says, “I will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who eats blood and I will cut them off from the people. For the life of the creature is in the blood.”\n\nThe text relates how some giants, named Ohya, Hahya, and Mahway, sons of the fallen angels, have some dreams that foresee the biblical Flood.[9] A brief mention of one of these giants, Ohya, is found in the Babylonian Talmud (Nidah, Ch 9), where it is said \"סיחון ועוג אחי הוו דאמר מר סיחון ועוג בני אחיה בר שמחזאי הוו\" (\"Sihon and Og [from the Book of Numbers] were brothers, as they were the sons of Ohia the son of Samhazai [one of the leaders of the fallen angels in the Book of Enoch])\". The version found at Qumran also describes the Sumerian hero Gilgamesh and the monster Humbaba.\n\nAlthough we can glean much information out of the fragments of the narrative, there are still many unknowns and issues that scholars heavily debate. Firstly, the authorship of the \"Book of Giants\" is still questionable. As mentioned earlier, there was very little usage of this manuscript which leaves scholars with many queries. The Qumran discoveries ruled out the Manicheans as being the composers of the \"Book of Giants\". However the usage of 1 Enoch assumes that the basis of the text would also fall under an unknown author or the idea that it was a pseudegraph text. This leads scholars to question the originality and legitimacy of this book.\n\nThe books of Daniel and 1 Enoch both have similarities to Ohyah and Hahyah’s (two giants) visions. Both have writings of the king of heaven sitting on his throne, and the Aramaic text A12 has similar writings. However, the text differs from these two as God comes down from heaven, but the basic premise remains the same. There are different versions of the \"Book of Giants\", which can cause issues. Furthermore, though both versions are said to derive from the same script, both are very different in their content. The Manichaean version has many differences from the Aramaic version and does not have the same visions in it.\n\nAccording to J.T. Milik, the Book of Giants is believed to have been a part of the Pentateuch of Enoch along with the Book of Watchers, the Book of Dreams, the Epistle of Enoch and the Astronomical Book. All of these would have been significant from the beginning of the first century. However, during the Christian era, this collection was altered and this narrative was replaced by the Book of Parables. The sparse copies of these books could have been due to a lack of overall use after it was replaced by the Book of Parables.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22567550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22567550", "title": "The Tower of London (novel)", "text": "The Tower of London (novel)\n\nThe Tower of London is a novel by William Harrison Ainsworth serially published in 1840. It is a historical romance that describes the history of Lady Jane Grey from her short-lived time as Queen of England to her execution.\n\nDuring 1840, Ainsworth was busy writing the serial \"The Tower of London\" while writing a serial for \"Guy Fawkes\" and while planning to start his own magazine. Both novels began their publication in January 1840, with \"The Tower of London\" being published on its own until December 1840. Ainsworth celebrated the conclusions of \"The Tower of London\" with a large dinner party near the printers of his works, Bradbury and Evans, at the Sussex Hotel. The work was illustrated by George Cruikshank.\n\nThe plot begins with Lady Jane Grey, wife of Guilford Dudley and daughter-in-law to the Duke of Northumberland, as she enters the Tower of London on 10 July 1553. Prior to her entrance into the Tower, she ruled as Queen of England for nine days after she and her husband were put on the throne by the Duke of Northumberland. Soon after, Mary I was able to take control of England and sent the Duke to be executed. Dudley, to gain back the kingdom, formed a rebellion, which results in failure and the imprisonment of both himself and his wife. After the imprisonment, Simon Renard, the Spanish Ambassador to England, arranges a marriage between Mary and Philip of Spain to bring a Catholic take over of England.\n\nThe events of the book alternate between historical background and the plot of Lady Jane. In Book II, incidents throughout the history of England from William the Conqueror to the 1820 Cato Street conspiracy are mentioned. The novel returns to Lady Jane busying herself with prayer as she awaits her execution with her only hope for freedom is to become a Catholic. There are conspiracies over Mary's rule of England, which come from those who supported the imprisoned Lady Jane and also those who wish to put Elizabeth, the Protestant daughter of Henry VIII, on the throne. However, neither of these two sides succeed before the novel ends, and Lady Jane is executed.\n\n\nThe novel is illustrated with 40 engravings and 58 woodcuts by Cruikshank. The illustrations depict moments from the story while the woodcuts show off architectural features related to the Tower. Ainsworth was grateful for the illustrations to the novel, and he wrote in the preface that \"it was no slight satisfaction to him, that circumstances at length enabled him to carry into effect his favourite project, in conjunction with the inimitable artist whose designs accompany the work.\"\n\nThe novel begins with a preface which explains: \"It has been, for years, the cherished wish of the writer of the following pages, to make the Tower of London – the proudest monument of antiquity, considered with reference to its historical associates, which this country, or any other possess – the groundwork of a romance\". He continues by describing his idea for the Tower itself, \"Desirous of exhibiting the Tower in its triple light of a palace, a prison, and a fortress, the Author has shaped his story with reference to that end; and he has also endeavoured to contrive such a series of incidents as should naturally introduce every reflect of the old pile – its towers, chapels, halls, chambers, gateways, arches, and draw-bridges – so that no part of it should remain unillustrated.\"\nThe focus in the novel is the three aspects of the Tower of London. To further this focus, Ainsworth depicts two crownings, a wedding, executions, and even a siege of the Tower. Lady Jane has her first night at the Tower as the Queen of England, and she visits St John's Chapel, located in the White Tower. Later, she is kept as the Tower's prisoner. Overall, the Tower has gothic elements along with having a connection to the Catholic Church in its architecture. The Tower, in its style, also represented the sublime and the connection with the divine. With these various dimensions to the Tower, there is a connection between \"The Tower of London\" and Victor Hugo's \"Notre Dame de Paris\", in their emphasis on architecture and with history.\n\nThe architectural descriptions within the novel tend to break up some of the aspects of the plot, but they serve to show how the Tower has changed over time. This transcends the temporal bounds of the plot to connect the origins of the Tower to the 19th century when Ainsworth published the novel. According to literary critic George Worth, \"Ainsworth seems constantly to be trying to remind his readers, living in an age of urbanization and industrialization in which historic old landmarks were being swept away or defaced or 'restored' beyond recognition, that they had a heritage, one very large vested in physical structures of one kind or another, and that the heritage [...] might soon be gone beyond recall.\"\n\nCatholics, in general, were viewed negatively by Ainsworth's contemporary English audience. In particular, Mary had the reputation for seeking the death of people and was dubbed \"Bloody Mary\". Although Ainsworth disagreed with the Catholic religion, he felt that they were part of an idealised English past, and he sought to describe them neutrally. Of Mary herself, Ainsworth emphasised aspects that made her a decent queen. Although many Catholics in the novel tried to use Mary to push Catholicism in a fanatical manner, Ainsworth introduces Cardinal Pole as a moderating figure who tries to sway Mary away from such views.\n\n\"The Tower of London\" is based on the events following the death of Edward VI. Various groups tried to seize the throne, and Mary I was crowned. This brought about a restoration of Catholicism and the rebellion of Thomas Wyatt. In depicting Mary, Ainsworth tried to overcome the view of her as \"Bloody Mary\" and any anti-Catholic bigotry. He felt that he could depict her without any bias as he focused on what was known about her knowledge and religious aspects. Ainsworth was accused of sensationalising violence in his novels; for instance critic Richard Church remarked that Ainsworth \"brought sensationalism and an atmosphere of the Chamber of Horrors into the historical novel\". Despite these assertions, Ainsworth was faithful to the sources he worked from. Most of his information was derived from David Jardine's \"A Reading on the Use of Torture in the Criminal Law of England\" (1837), and details such as the use of the Scavenger's Daughter are based on Jardine's description of torture in the Tudor period. By recounting suffering and torture in \"The Tower of London\", Ainsworth made plain the consequences of failed political intrigue in the Tudor period. Jardine notes that members of the nobility were not tortured; Ainsworth overlooks this with the intention of showing that failure in political machinations came at a high price. In this, Ligocki feels that Ainsworth was true to the nature of the Tudor period, reflecting the \"cruelty and ruthlessness of the politically ambitious of the age\".\n\nEdgar Allan Poe believes that \"The authorship of this work does a little, and but a little, more credit to Mr. Ainsworth than that of 'Jack Sheppard'. It is in no spirit cavilling that we say it is rarely our lot to review a work more utterly destitute of every ingredient requisite to a good romance\".\n\nIn 1934, Malcolm Elwin argues, \"several of his novels – particularly \"Tower of London\" and \"Old St. Paul's\", in spite of the absurd antics of the hero of the latter – have undoubtedly the quality of durability. No writer could hope to surpass either as romantic histories of their particular subject.\" Leo Mason, in a 1939 article, says that \"History through the eyes of romance is the essence of Ainsworth at his best – \"The Lancashire Witches\", \"Tower of London\", \"Old St. Paul's\", are romantic histories and will no doubt endure.\" Worth, in 1972, explains that Ainsworth \"spaces his [architectural] descriptions judiciously throughout the novel in such a way as to heighten the effect of the novel rather than detract from it.\" In 1975, Nicholas Rance claims that \"The Tower of London\" is an \"incongruous merging of historical romance and guide book\".\n\nThe enduring image of the Tower of London as a grim place of torture and imprisonment was largely shaped by the works of 19th-century authors, particularly Ainsworth's novel. Such was its influence in emphasising the Tudor epoch of the Tower's history, in the late 20th century historians R Allen Brown and P Curnow felt it still dominated the public perception of the castle. In their official handbook to the Tower, published in 1986, the noted that \"Still an innocent visitor to the place today might be led to suppose by guides and guidebooks, that it was built almost entirely for the Tudor monarchs\".\n\n"}

L. LaFevers.\n\nTheodosia Throckmorton, a clever and shrewd girl of sorts, has the harrowing and busy work of nullifying curses in her father's museum, where the darkest spells abound. However, it is delicate work, and time is running out for her to set things right. A crate arrives from Theo's mother in Egypt, which contains a cursed statue of Bastet. While transferring the curse from the statue to a wax figure, she becomes distracted and redirects it into her cat, Isis. Her hands are full enough when her mother returns from the tombs of Egypt, bringing countless cursed valuables and antiquities with her. While picking her mother up at the train station, Theodosia catches a street urchin named Sticky Will trying to pick her father's pocket. He informs her that someone is following her mother. Theo tells him she will be at the station tomorrow and he can tell her more about the man then. Back at the museum, they unload Theo's mother's trunks.Theo senses the curses on the artifacts. The most powerful is a gem called the Heart of Egypt, with the power to topple the whole of Great Britain and the entire British Empire.\n\nThe next day, her brother Henry returns from boarding school. The Heart of Egypt is stolen, and Theo suspects someone from the British Museum and investigates, Henry tagging along without her consent. A Mr. Tetley is acting suspiciously, and they decide to follow him. While traveling through the Seven Dials, they meet Will and witness a man taking the Heart from Tetley, then the same man is stabbed in a churchyard. Theodosia hears the man mumble \"Som set hoo\", or \"Somerset House\". He tells Theo to speak to Wigmere, only Wigmere. She sends Henry and Will to Somerset House while she struggles to keep the man alive using her amulets. Will and Henry bring help, and Theo is introduced to Lord Wigmere, head of the Antiquarian Society and The Brotherhood of Chosen Keepers, a group dedicated to nullifying curses. Theodosia is relieved to know there are others like her, but disturbed that no one else can sense the curses the way she can. Henry and Will are not told the true nature of the Keepers, although Will is taken on as a message boy later on. Theo is also angry that Wigmere may suspect her mother of stealing the Heart of Egypt, as she works closely with Count Von Braggenchnot, head of the Serpents of Chaos who will do anything to rain plague and pestilence down on England.\n\nAfter Theodosia escapes, she sneaks onto a ship on which her mother and father are traveling to go to Egypt. While in Egypt, Theodosia finds a hidden part of a pyramid. She discovers that the First Assistant Curator, Nigel Bollingsworth, is the traitor. Theodosia is very clever, and uses the Egyptian version of voodoo dolls to hurt Tetley. She reaches into the pocket of her pinafore and throws sand from the tomb at Nigel, the left side of his face dissolving. Clever Theo finds another tomb and returns the Heart of Egypt to its rightful place. Theodosia finds an important artifact—the Was scepter—and hits Nigel on the head with it.\n\nTheo is rescued by her parents and Nabir, her mother's dragoman. They return home, where Wigmere gives Theodosia a ring, and Theo becomes an official member of the Brotherhood of the Chosen Keepers.\n\n\n\n\"Theodosia and the Serpents of Chaos\" is a Junior Library Guild Selection and a \"Booksense\" Summer Pick.\n\n"}
{"id": "66106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66106", "title": "Whitney Museum of American Art", "text": "Whitney Museum of American Art\n\nThe Whitney Museum of American Art – known informally as the \"Whitney\" – is an art museum located in Manhattan. It was founded in 1931 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (1875–1942), a wealthy and prominent American socialite and art patron after whom the museum is named.\n\nThe Whitney focuses on 20th- and 21st-century American art. Its permanent collection comprises more than 21,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, films, videos, and artifacts of new media by more than 3,000 artists. It places a particular emphasis on exhibiting the work of living artists for its collection as well as maintaining an extensive permanent collection containing many important pieces from the first half of the last century. The museum's Annual and Biennial exhibitions have long been a venue for younger and less well-known artists whose work is showcased there.\n\nFrom 1966 to 2014, the Whitney was located at 945 Madison Avenue at East 75th Street in Manhattan's Upper East Side. The museum closed in October 2014 to relocate to a new building designed by Renzo Piano located at 99 Gansevoort Street at Washington Street in the West Village/Meatpacking District neighborhoods of Lower Manhattan; it reopened at the new location on May 1, 2015.\n\nGertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, the museum's namesake and founder, was a well-regarded sculptor as well as a serious art collector. As a patron of the arts, she had already achieved some success as the creator of the \"Whitney Studio Club\", a New York–based exhibition space which she created in 1918 to promote the works of avant-garde and unrecognized American artists. Whitney favored the radical art of the American artists of the Ashcan School such as John Sloan, George Luks and Everett Shinn, as well as others such as Edward Hopper, Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Charles Sheeler, and Max Weber.\n\nWith the aid of her assistant, Juliana R. Force, Whitney had collected nearly 700 works of American art. In 1929, she offered to donate over 500 works of art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but the museum declined the gift. This, along with the apparent preference for European modernism at the recently opened Museum of Modern Art, led Whitney to start her own museum, exclusively for American art, in 1929.\n\nWhitney Library archives from 1928 reveal that during this time the Studio Club utilized the gallery space of Wilhelmina Weber Furlong of the Art Students League to exhibit traveling shows featuring Modernist works. In 1931, architect Noel L. Miller converted three row houses on West 8th Street in Greenwich Village – one of which, 8 west 8th Street (Manhattan) had been the location of the \"Studio Club\" – to be the museum's home as well as a residence for Whitney. Force became the first director of the museum, and under her guidance, the museum concentrated on displaying the works of new and contemporary American artists.\n\nIn 1954, the museum left its original location and moved to a small structure on 54th Street connected to and behind the Museum of Modern Art on 53rd Street. On April 15, 1958, a fire on the second floor of MOMA that killed one person forced the evacuation of paintings and staff on MOMA's upper floors to the Whitney. Among the paintings moved in the evacuation was \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte\" which had been on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn 1961, the museum began seeking a site for a larger building. The Whitney settled in 1966 at the southeast corner of Madison Avenue at 75th Street in Manhattan's Upper East Side. The building, planned and built 1963–1966 by Marcel Breuer and Hamilton P. Smith in a distinctively modern style, is easily distinguished from the neighboring townhouses by its staircase façade made from granite stones and its external upside-down windows. In 1967, Mauricio Lasansky showed The Nazi Drawings. The exhibition traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, where they appeared with shows by Louise Nevelson and Andrew Wyeth as the first exhibits installed in the new museum.\n\nThe institution grappled with space problems for decades. From 1973 to 1983 the Whitney operated its first branch at 55 Water Street, in a building owned by Harold Uris who gave the museum a lease for $1 a year. In 1983 Philip Morris installed a Whitney branch in the lobby of its Park Avenue headquarters. In 1981 the museum opened an exhibition space in Stamford, Connecticut, housed at Champion International. In the late 1980s, the Whitney entered into arrangements with Park Tower Realty, I.B.M. and The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, setting up satellite museums with rotating exhibitions in the lobbies of their buildings. Each museum had its own director, with all plans approved by a Whitney committee.\n\nThe institution attempted to expand its landmark building in 1978, commissioning UK architects Derek Walker and Norman Foster to design a tall tower alongside it, the first of several proposals from leading architects. But each time the effort was abandoned, either because of the cost or the design or both. In order to secure additional space for the museum's collections, then-director Thomas N. Armstrong III developed plans for a 10-story, $37.5-million addition to the Whitney's main building. The proposed addition, designed by Michael Graves and announced in 1985, drew immediate opposition. Graves had proposed demolishing the flanking brownstones down to the East 74th Street corner for a complementary addition. The project gradually lost the support of the museum’s trustees, and the plans were dropped in 1989. Between 1995 and 1998, the building underwent a renovation and expansion by Richard Gluckman. In 2001, Rem Koolhaas was commissioned to submit two designs for a $200 million expansion. Those plans were dropped in 2003, causing director Maxwell L. Anderson to resign. New York restaurateur Danny Meyer opened Untitled, a restaurant in the museum in March 2011. The space was designed by the Rockwell Group.\n\nThe Whitney developed a new main building, designed by Renzo Piano, in the West Village and Meatpacking District sections of lower Manhattan. The new museum, located at the intersection of Gansevoort and Washington Streets, was built on a previously city-owned site and marks the southern entrance to the High Line park. Construction began in 2010 and was completed in 2015. The construction was $422 million.\n\nThe new structure spans and 8 stories that include the city's largest column-free art gallery spaces, an education center, theater, a conservation lab and a library and reading rooms. Two of the floors are fully devoted to the museum's permanent collection. The only permanent artwork commissioned for the site – its four main elevators – were conceived by Richard Artschwager. The new building's collection comprises over 600 works by over 400 artists. There are observation decks on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th floors linked by an outdoor staircase.\n\nThe new building is much more expansive and open than the old ones. As one \"New York Times\" review described the building:\n\nThe museum needed to raise $760 million for the building and its endowment. In May 2011, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced it had entered into an agreement to occupy the Madison Avenue building for at least eight years starting in 2015, easing the Whitney of the burden of having to finance two large museum spaces. The occupation of the old space was later postponed to 2016.\n\nAfter an April 30, 2015, ceremonial ribbon cutting attended by Michelle Obama and Bill de Blasio, the new building opened on May 1, 2015.\n\nThe museum displays paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, installation art, video, and photography. Every two years, the museum hosts the Whitney Biennial, an international art show which displays many lesser-known artists new to the American art scene. It has displayed works by many notable artists, and has featured unconventional works such as a 1976 exhibit of live body builders, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nThe original 600 works in the permanent collection grew to about 1,300 by 1954 when the second Museum building opened, and to approximately 2,000 with the opening of the Breuer building in 1966. Today the permanent collection contains more than 18,000 works of art from many renowned artists. Artists represented include Josef Albers, Joe Andoe, Donald Baechler, Thomas Hart Benton, Lucile Blanch, Louise Bourgeois, Charles Burchfield, Alexander Calder, Ching Ho Cheng, Dan Christensen, Greg Colson, Ronald Davis, Stuart Davis, Richard Diebenkorn, Arthur Dove, William Eggleston, Helen Frankenthaler, Georgia O'Keeffe, Arshile Gorky, Keith Haring, Grace Hartigan, Marsden Hartley, Robert Henri, Carmen Herrera, Eva Hesse, Hans Hofmann, Edward Hopper, Jasper Johns, Corita Kent, Franz Kline, Terence Koh, Willem de Kooning, Lee Krasner, Ronnie Landfield, John Marin, Knox Martin, John McCracken, John McLaughlin, Robert Motherwell, Bruce Nauman, Louise Nevelson, Barnett Newman, Kenneth Noland, Paul Pfeiffer, Jackson Pollock, Larry Poons, Maurice Prendergast, Kenneth Price, Robert Rauschenberg, Man Ray, Mark Rothko, Morgan Russell, Albert Pinkham Ryder, Cindy Sherman, John Sloan, Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, and hundreds of others. A photography collection was begun in 1991.\n\nIn addition to its traditional collection the Whitney has a website, called Artport, that features \"Net Art\" that changes monthly. The Whitney Museum of American Art will not sell any work by a living artist because it could damage that artist’s career. But it will trade a living artist’s work for another piece by the same artist.\n\nThe Frances Mulhall Achilles Library is a research library originally built on the collections of books and papers of founder Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, and the Whitney Museum’s first director, Juliana Force. The Library currently operates in the West Chelsea area of New York City. The Library in West Chelsea contains Special Collections, and the Whitney Museum Archives. The Whitney Museum Archives contain the Institutional Archives, Research Collections, and Manuscript Collections. The Library’s Special Collections consist of artists’ books, portfolios, photographs, titles in the Whitney Fellows Artist and Writers Series (1982–2001), posters, and valuable ephemera that relate to the\nMuseum’s permanent collection. The Institutional Archives exhibition records, photographs, curatorial research notes, artist's correspondence, audio and video recordings, and Trustees papers from 1912 to the present.\n\nHighlights:\n\nBooks and materials in the Library can be accessed in the Museum's database.\n\nIn 1968, Ron Clark, at the age of 25, established in conjunction with the Whitney Museum of American Art an independent study program (known as the ISP or sometimes the Whitney ISP), which helped start the careers of artists, critics, and curators including Jenny Holzer, Andrea Fraser, Julian Schnabel, Kathryn Bigelow, Roberta Smith, and Félix González-Torres, as well as many other well-known and influential cultural producers. The program includes both art history and studio programs. Each year the Independent Study Program selects fourteen students to participate in the Studio Program (artists), four in the Curatorial Program (curators) and six in the Critical Studies Program (researchers). It is a one-year program that includes many both visiting and hired artists, art historians, and critics and involves the reading of theory. Ron Clark remains director of the program..\n\nAs of March 2011, the Whitney's endowment was $207 million; the museum expected to raise $625 million from its capital campaign by 2015. As of June 2016, the endowment had grown to $308 million.\n\nHistorically, the operating performance has been essentially breakeven. The museum restricts the use of its endowment fund to cover yearly operating expenses to 5 percent of the fund's value. The Whitney has historically depended on private collectors and donors for acquisitions of new art. In 2008, Leonard A. Lauder gave the museum $131 million, the biggest donation in the Whitney’s history. Donations for new purchases dropped to $1.3 million in 2010 from $2.7 million in 2006.\n\nThe museum's current director is Adam D. Weinberg (since 2003). Former directors include Maxwell L. Anderson (1998–2003), David A. Ross (1991–1997), Thomas Armstrong III (1974–1990), and Juliana Rieser Force (1931–1948).\n\nFor years Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney supported the museum single-handedly, as did her daughter, Flora Whitney Miller, after her, and until 1961 its board was largely family-run. Flora Payne Whitney, served as a museum trustee, then as vice president. From 1942 to 1974 she was the museum's president and chairman after which she functioned as honorary chairman until her death in 1986. Her daughter, Flora Miller Biddle, served as its president until 1985. In 1999, her book \"The Whitney Women and the Museum They Made\" was published.\n\nIn 1961, the need for outside support finally forced the board to add outside trustees, including bankers Roy Neuberger and Arthur G. Altschul. David Solinger became the Whitney's first outside president in 1966.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16615604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16615604", "title": "Winter Palace", "text": "Winter Palace\n\nThe Winter Palace () in Saint Petersburg, Russia, was, from 1732 to 1917, the official residence of the Russian monarchs. Today, the restored palace forms part of a complex of buildings housing the Hermitage Museum. Situated between the Palace Embankment and the Palace Square, adjacent to the site of Peter the Great's original Winter Palace, the present and fourth Winter Palace was built and altered almost continuously between the late 1730s and 1837, when it was severely damaged by fire and immediately rebuilt. The storming of the palace in 1917 as depicted in Soviet paintings and Eisenstein's 1927 film \"October\" became an iconic symbol of the Russian Revolution.\n\nThe palace was constructed on a monumental scale that was intended to reflect the might and power of Imperial Russia. From the palace, the Tsar ruled over (almost 1/6 of the Earth's landmass) and over 125 million subjects by the end of the 19th century. It was designed by many architects, most notably Bartolomeo Rastrelli, in what came to be known as the Elizabethan Baroque style. The green-and-white palace has the shape of an elongated rectangle, and its principal façade is long and high. The Winter Palace has been calculated to contain 1,786 doors, 1,945 windows, 1,500 rooms and 117 staircases. Following a serious fire, the palace's rebuilding of 1837 left the exterior unchanged, but large parts of the interior were redesigned in a variety of tastes and styles, leading the palace to be described as a \"19th-century palace inspired by a model in Rococo style\".\n\nIn 1905, the Bloody Sunday massacre occurred when demonstrators marched toward the Winter Palace, but by this time the Imperial Family had chosen to live in the more secure and secluded Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo, and returned to the Winter Palace only for formal and state occasions. Following the February Revolution of 1917, the palace was for a short time the seat of the Russian Provisional Government, led by Alexander Kerensky. Later that same year, the palace was stormed by a detachment of Red Army soldiers and sailors—a defining moment in the birth of the Soviet state.\n\nLater returning from his Grand Embassy in 1698, Peter I of Russia embarked on a policy of Westernization and expansion that was to transform the Tsardom of Russia into the Russian Empire and a major European power. This policy was manifested in bricks and mortar by the creation of a new city, Saint Petersburg, in 1703. The culture and design of the new city was intended as a conscious rejection of traditional Byzantine-influenced Russian architecture, such as the then-fashionable Naryshkin Baroque, in favour of the classically inspired architecture prevailing in the great cities of Europe. The Tsar intended that his new city would be designed in a Flemish renaissance style, later known as Petrine Baroque, and this was the style he selected for his new palace in the city. The first Royal residence on the site had been a humble log cabin then known as the Domik Petra I, built in 1704, which faced the River Neva. In 1711 it was transported to the Petrovskaya Naberezhnaya, where it still stands. With the site cleared, the Tsar then embarked on the building of a larger house between 1711 and 1712. This house, today referred to as the first Winter Palace, was designed by Domenico Trezzini.\n\nThe 18th century was a period of great development in European royal architecture, as the need for a fortified residence gradually lessened. This process, which had begun in the late 16th century, accelerated and great classical palaces quickly replaced fortified castles throughout the more powerful European countries. One of the earliest and most notable examples was Louis XIV's Versailles. Largely completed by 1710, Versailles—with its size and splendour—heightened rivalry amongst the sovereigns of Europe. Peter the Great of Russia, keen to promote all western concepts, wished to have a modern palace like his fellow sovereigns. However, unlike some of his successors, Peter I never aspired to rival Versailles.\n\nThe first Winter Palace was a modest building of two main floors under a slate roof. It seems that Peter soon tired of the first palace, for in 1721, the second version of the Winter Palace was built under the direction of architect Georg Mattarnovy. Mattarnovy's palace, though still very modest compared to royal palaces in other European capitals, was on two floors above a rusticated ground floor, with a central projection underneath a pediment supported by columns. It was here that Peter the Great died in 1725.\n\nThe Winter Palace was not the only palace in the unfinished city, or even the most splendid, as Peter had ordered his nobles to construct residences and to spend half the year there. This was an unpopular command; Saint Petersburg was founded upon a swamp, with little sunlight, and it was said only cabbages and turnips would grow there. It was forbidden to fell trees for fuel, so hot water was permitted just once a week. Only Peter's second wife, Empress Catherine, pretended to enjoy life in the new city.\n\nAs a result of pressed slave labour from all over the Empire, work on the city progressed quickly. It has been estimated that 200,000 people died in twenty years while building the city. A diplomat of the time, who described the city as \"a heap of villages linked together, like some plantation in the West Indies\", just a few years later called it \"a wonder of the world, considering its magnificent palaces\". Some of these new palaces in Peter's beloved Flemish Baroque style, such as the and the Menshikov Palace, still stand.\n\nOn Peter the Great's death in 1725, the city of Saint Petersburg was still far from being the centre of western culture and civilization that he had envisioned. Many of the aristocrats who had been compelled by the Tsar to inhabit Saint Petersburg left. Wolves roamed the squares at night while bands of discontented pressed serfs, imported to build the Tsar's new city and Baltic fleet, frequently rebelled.\n\nPeter I was succeeded by his widow, Catherine I, who reigned until her death in 1727. She in turn was succeeded by Peter I's grandson Peter II, who in 1727 had Mattarnovy's palace greatly enlarged by the architect Domenico Trezzini. Trezzini, who had designed the Summer Palace in 1711, was one of the greatest exponents of the Petrine Baroque style, now completely redesigned and expanded Mattarnovy's existing Winter Palace to such an extent that Mattarnovy's entire palace became merely one of the two terminating pavilions of the new, and third, Winter Palace. The third palace, like the second, was in the Petrine Baroque style.\n\nIn 1728, shortly after the third palace was completed, the Imperial Court left Saint Petersburg for Moscow, and the Winter Palace lost its status as the principal imperial residence. Moscow had once again been designated the capital city, a status which had been granted to Saint Petersburg in 1713. Following the death of Peter II in 1730, the throne passed to a niece of Peter I, Anna Ivanovna, Duchess of Courland.\n\nThe new Empress cared more for Saint Petersburg than her immediate predecessors; she re-established the Imperial court at the Winter Palace and, in 1732, Saint Petersburg again officially replaced Moscow as Russia's capital, a position it was to hold until 1918.\n\nIgnoring the third Winter Palace, the Empress on her return to Saint Petersburg took up residence at the neighbouring Apraksin Palace. In 1732, the Tsaritsa commissioned the architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli to completely rebuild and extend the Apraksin Palace, incorporating other neighbouring houses. Thus, the core of the fourth and final Winter Palace is not the palace of Peter the Great, but the palace of Admiral General Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin.\n\nThe Empress Anna, though unpopular and considered \"dull, coarse, fat, harsh and spiteful\", was keen to introduce a more civilized and cultured air to her court. She designed new liveries for her servants and, on her orders, mead and vodka were replaced with champagne and Burgundy. She instructed the Boyars to replace their plain furniture with that of mahogany and ebony, while her own tastes in interior decoration ran to a dressing table of solid gold and an \"easing stool\" of silver, studded with rubies. It was against such a backdrop of magnificence and extravagance that she gave her first ball in the newly completed gallery at the Winter Palace, which, in the middle of the Russian winter, resembled an orange grove. This, the fourth version of the Winter Palace, was to be an ongoing project for the architect Rastrelli throughout the reign of the Empress Anna.\n\nThe infant Tsar Ivan VI, succeeding Anna in 1740, was soon deposed in a bloodless coup d'état by Grand Duchess Elizabeth, a daughter of Peter the Great. Delegating almost all powers to her favourites, the new Empress Elizabeth assumed a life of pleasure which led the court at the Winter Palace to be described later by the Russian historian Vasily Klyuchevsky as a place of \"gilded squalor\".\n\nDuring the reign of Elizabeth, Rastrelli, still working to his original plan, devised an entirely new scheme in 1753, on a colossal scale—the present Winter Palace. The expedited completion of the palace became a matter of honour to the Empress, who regarded the palace as a symbol of national prestige. Work on the building continued throughout the year, even in the severest months of the winter. The deprivation to both the Russian people and the army caused by the ongoing Seven Years' War were not permitted to hinder the progress. 859,555 rubles had been allocated to the project, a sum raised by a tax on state-owned taverns. Though the labourers earned a monthly wage of just one ruble, the cost of the project exceeded the budget, so much so that work ceased due to lack of resources despite the Empress' obsessive desire for rapid completion. Ultimately, taxes were increased on salt and alcohol to fund the extra costs, although the Russian people were already burdened by taxes to pay for the war. The final cost was 2,500,000 rubles. By 1759, shortly before Elizabeth's death, a Winter Palace truly worthy of the name was nearing completion.\n\nIt was Empress Elizabeth who selected the German princess, Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, as a bride for her nephew and successor, Peter III. The marriage was not a success, but it was this princess who, as Catherine the Great, came to be chiefly associated with the Winter Palace. In 1762, following a coup d'état, in which her husband was murdered, Catherine paraded her seven-year-old son, Paul, on the Winter Palace's balcony to an excited crowd below. She was not presenting her son as the new and rightful ruler of Russia, however; that honour she was usurping herself.\nCatherine's patronage of the architects Starov and Giacomo Quarenghi saw the palace further enlarged and transformed. At this time an opera house which had existed in the southwestern wing of the palace was swept away to provide apartments for members of Catherine's family. In 1790, Quarenghi redesigned five of Rastrelli's state rooms to create the three vast halls of the Neva enfilade. Catherine was responsible for the three large adjoining palaces, known collectively as the Hermitage—the name by which the entire complex, including the Winter Palace, was to become known 150 years later.\n\nCatherine had been impressed by the French architect Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe, who designed the Imperial Academy of Arts (also in Saint Petersburg) and commissioned him to add a new wing to the Winter Palace. This was intended as a place of retreat from the formalities and ceremonies of the court. Catherine christened it the Hermitage \"(14)\", a name used by her predecessor Tsaritsa Elizabeth to describe her private rooms within the palace.\n\nThe interior of the Hermitage wing was intended to be a simple contrast to that of the Winter Palace. Indeed, it is said that the concept of the Hermitage as a retreat was suggested to Catherine by that advocate of the simple life, Jean Jacques Rousseau. In reality, it was another large palace in itself, connected to the main palace by a series of covered walkways and heated courtyards in which flew rare exotic birds. Noted for its fine portico and attention to details of a delicate nature, it was richly furnished with an ever-growing art collection.\nThe palace's art collection was assembled haphazardly in an eclectic manner, often with an eye to quantity rather than quality. Many of the artworks purchased for the palaces arrived as parts of a job lot as the sovereign acquired whole ready-assembled collections. The Empress' ambassadors in Rome, Paris, Amsterdam and London were instructed to look out for and purchase thousands of priceless works of art on her behalf. Ironically, while Saint Petersburg high society and the extended Romanov family derided Russia's last Empress for furnishing her palaces \"mail order\" from Maples of London, she was following the practices of Catherine the Great, who, if not exactly by \"mail order\", certainly bought \"sight unseen.\"\n\nIn this way, between 1764 and 1781 Catherine the Great acquired six major collections: those of Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky; Heinrich von Brühl; Pierre Crozat; Horace Walpole; Sylvestre-Raphael Baudouin; and finally in 1787, the John Lyde-Brown collection. These large assemblies of art included works by such masters as Rembrandt, Rubens, Titian, Raphael, Tiepolo, van Dyck and Reni. The acquisition of 225 paintings forming the Gotzkowsky collection was a source of personal pride to Catherine. It had been put together by Gotzkowsky for Catherine's adversary, Frederick the Great of Prussia who, as a result of his wars with Russia, could not afford to pay for it. This collection included some great Flemish and Dutch works, most notably Frans Hals' \"Portrait of a Young Man with a Glove.\" In 1769, the Bruhl collection brought to the Winter Palace two further works by Rembrandt, \"Portrait of a Scholar\" and \"Portrait of an Old Man in Red\".\n\nWhile some aspects of this manic collecting could have been a manifestation of Catherine's desire for a recognition of her intellectual concepts, there was also a more fundamental motivation: necessity. Just twenty years earlier, so scarce were the furnishings of the Imperial palaces that bedsteads, mirrors, tables and chairs had to be conveyed between Moscow and Saint Petersburg each time the court moved.\n\nAs the palace filled with art, it overflowed into the Hermitage. So large did Catherine's art collection eventually become that it became necessary to commission the German-trained architect Yury Velten to build a second and larger extension to the palace, which eventually became known as the Old Hermitage (\"15\"). Later, Catherine commissioned a third extension, the Hermitage Theatre, designed by Giacomo Quarenghi. This construction necessitated the demolition of Peter the Great's by now crumbling third Winter palace.\nThe Empress' life within the Hermitage, surrounded by her art and friends, was simpler than in the adjacent Winter Palace; there, the Empress gave small intimate suppers. Servants were excluded from these suppers and a sign on the wall read \"Sit down where you choose, and when you please without it being repeated to you a thousand times.\"\n\nCatherine was also responsible for introducing the lasting affection for all things French to the Russian court. While she personally disliked France, her distaste did not extend to its culture and manners. French became the language of the court; Russian was relegated for use only when speaking to servants and inferiors. The Russian aristocracy was encouraged to embrace the philosophies of Molière, Racine and Corneille. The Winter Palace was to serve as a model for numerous Russian palaces belonging to Catherine's aristocracy, all of them, like the Winter Palace itself, built by the slave labour of Russian serfs. The sophistication and manners observed inside the Winter Palace were greatly at odds with the grim reality of life outside its externally gilded walls. In 1767, as the Winter Palace grew in richness and splendour, the Empress published an edict extending Russian serfdom. During her reign she further enslaved over a million peasants. Work continued on the Winter Palace right up until the time of the Empress' death in 1796.\n\nCatherine the Great was succeeded by her son Paul I. In the first days of his reign, the new Tsar (reported by the British Ambassador to be \"not in his senses\") augmented the number of troops stationed at the Winter Palace, positioning sentry boxes every few metres around the building. Eventually, paranoid for his security and disliking anything connected with his mother, he spurned the Winter Palace completely and built Saint Michael's Castle as his Saint Petersburg residence, on the site of his birthplace. The Tsar announced that he wished to die on the spot he was born. He was murdered there three weeks after taking up residence in 1801. Paul I was succeeded by his 24-year-old son, Alexander I, who ruled Russia during the chaotic period of the Napoleonic Wars. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1815, the contents of the Winter Palace were further enhanced when Alexander I purchased the art collection of the former French Empress, Joséphine. This collection, some of it plundered loot given to her by her ex-husband Napoleon, contained amongst its many old masters Rembrandt's \"The Descent from the Cross\" and four sculptures by Antonio Canova.\n\nAlexander I was succeeded in 1825 by his brother Nicholas I. Tsar Nicholas was to be responsible for the palace's present appearance and layout. He not only effected many changes to the interior of the palace, but was responsible for its complete rebuilding following the fire of 1837.\n\nAs completed, the overriding exterior form of the Winter Palace's architecture, with its decoration in the form of statuary and opulent stucco work on the pediments above façades and windows, is Baroque. The exterior has remained as finished during the reign of Empress Elizabeth. The principal façades, those facing the Palace Square and the Neva river, have always been accessible and visible to the public. Only the lateral façades are hidden behind granite walls, concealing a garden created during the reign of Nicholas II. The building was conceived as a town palace, rather than a private palace within a park, such as that of the French kings at Versailles.\nThe architectural theme continues throughout the interior of the palace. The first floor, being the piano nobile, is distinguished by windows taller than those of the floors above and below. Each window is divided from its neighbour by a pilaster. The repetitive monotony of the long elevations is broken only by symmetrically placed slightly projecting bays, many with their own small portico. This theme has been constant during all subsequent rebuilding and alterations to the palace. The only external changes have been in colour: at various times in its history the palace has been painted different shades. In the eighteenth century, the palace was painted straw yellow with white and gilded ornament. Under Nicholas I in 1837, it was painted a dull red, which it remained through the revolution and early Soviet period. Following the restoration work after World War II, it was painted green with the ornament depicted in white, the standard Soviet color scheme for Baroque buildings. (The Stroganov Palace, for example, was also green and white in this period.)\n\nInternally, the palace appears as a combination of the Baroque and the Neoclassical. Little of Rastrelli's rococo interior design has survived; only the Jordan Staircase and the Grand Church remain in their original style. The changes to the interior were largely due to the influences of the architects employed by Catherine the Great in the last years of her life, Starov and Quarenghi, who began to alter much of the interior of the palace as designed by Rastrelli. Catherine always wanted the latest fashions, and during her reign the more severe neoclassical architectural influences, fashionable in Western Europe from the late 1760s, slowly crept towards Saint Petersburg. The neoclassical interiors were further emphasised and extended during the reign of Catherine's grandson, Nicholas I.\n\nQuarenghi is credited with introducing the Neoclassical style to Saint Petersburg. His work, together with that of Karl Ivanovich Rossi and Auguste de Montferrand, gradually transformed Saint Petersburg into an \"Empire Town\". Montferrand not only created some of the palace's greatest neoclassical interiors, but also was responsible for the erection of the Column of Alexander during the reign of Nicholas I in Rossi's newly designed Palace Square.\n\nFor a long time the Winter Palace was the tallest edifice in the city. In 1844, Nicholas I gave the orders to the effect that private houses should be at least 1 sazhen (2.13 m) lower than the Winter Palace. This rule was effective until 1905.\n\nThe Winter Palace is said to contain 1,500 rooms, 1,786 doors and 1,945 windows. The principal façade is long and high. The ground floor contained mostly bureaucratic and domestic offices, while the second floor was given over to apartments for senior courtiers and high-ranking officials. The principal rooms and living quarters of the Imperial Family are on the first floor, the piano nobile. The great state rooms, used by the court, are arranged in two enfilades, from the top of the Jordan Staircase. The original Baroque suite of the Tsaritsa Elizabeth running west, fronting the Neva, was completely redesigned in 1790–93 by Giacomo Quarenghi. He transformed the original enfilade of five state rooms into a suite of three vast halls, decorated with faux marble columns, bas-reliefs and statuary.\nA second suite of state rooms running south to the Great Church was created for Catherine II. Between 1787–95, Quarenghi added a new eastern wing to this suite which contained the great throne room, known as St George's Hall \"(13)\", which linked the Winter Palace to Catherine's less formal palace, the Hermitage, next door. This suite was altered in the 1820s when the Military Gallery \"(11)\" was created from a series of small rooms, to celebrate the defeat of Napoleon. This gallery, which had been conceived by Alexander I, was designed by Carlo Rossi and was built between June and November 1826 under Nicolas I; it was inaugurated on 25 October 1826. For the 1812 Gallery, the Tsar commissioned 332 portraits of the generals instrumental in the defeat of France. The artist was the Briton George Dawe, who received assistance from Alexander Polyakov and Wilhelm August Golicke.\n\nNicholas I was also responsible for the creation of the Battle Galleries \"(19)\", which occupy the central portion of the Palace Square façade. They were redesigned by Alexander Briullov to commemorate the Russian victories prior to 1812. Immediately adjacent to these galleries celebrating the French defeat, were rooms \"(18)\" where Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg, Napoleon's step-grandson and the Tsar's son-in-law, lived during the early days of his marriage.\n\nIn 1833, de Montferrand was hired to redesign the eastern state rooms and create the Field Marshal's Hall and the Small Throne Room \"(9 & 10)\". In 1837, a fire broke out. Its cause is unknown, but its spread is blamed on de Montferrand. The architect was being hurried by the Tsar for an early completion, so he used wooden materials where stone would have been better. Additionally, between the hurriedly built wooden partition walls disused fireplaces were concealed; their chimneys, coupled with the narrow ventilation shafts, acted as flues for the fire, allowing it to spread undetected between the walls from room to room until it was too late to extinguish.\n\nOnce detected, the fire continued to spread, but slowly enough that the palace guards and staff were able to rescue many of the contents, depositing them in the snow in Palace Square. This was no mean feat, as the treasures of the Winter Palace were always heavy furniture and fragile ornaments rather than lighter paintings. To create a firebreak, the Tsar ordered the destruction of the three passages leading to the Hermitage, a fortunate act which saved the building and the huge art collection. The Russian poet Vasily Zhukovsky witnessed the conflagration—\"a vast bonfire with flames reaching the sky.\" The fire burned for several days, and destroyed most of the Winter Palace's interior.\n\nSeeming to ignore the size of the palace, the Tsar ordered that the rebuilding be completed within a year. The Marquis de Custine described the \"unheard of efforts\" that were necessary to facilitate this. \"During the great frosts 6000 workmen were continually employed; of these a considerable number died daily, but the victims were instantly replaced by other champions brought forward to perish.\" The work was supervised by Pyotr Kleinmichel, who had already gained a reputation for ruthlessness when serving in the military settlements under Arakcheev.\n\nThe rebuilding of the palace took advantage of the latest construction techniques of the industrial age. The roof was supported by a metal framework, while the spans of ceilings in the great halls were supported by iron girders. Following the fire, the exterior, most of the principal state suites, the Jordan staircase and the Grand Church were restored to their original design and decoration by the architect Vasily Stasov. Some of the rooms, such as the second largest room in the Winter Palace, the Armorial Hall, became far more ornate, however, with a heavy use of gilt. The smaller and more private rooms of the palace were altered and decorated in various 19th-century contemporary styles by Alexander Briullov according to whims and fashion of their intended occupants, ranging from Gothic to rococo. The Tsarevna's crimson boudoir \"(23)\", in the private Imperial apartments, was a faithful reproduction of the rococo style, which Catherine II and her architects started to eliminate from the palace less than 50 years earlier. One of the palace's most notable rooms was created as a result of the fire when the Jasper Room, which had been destroyed, was rebuilt as the Malachite Drawing Room, the principal reception room of the Tsaritsa's suite. The Tsar himself, for all the grandeur he created in his palaces, loved the greatest simplicity. His bedroom at the Winter Palace was spartan, with no ornaments save for some maps and an icon, and he slept on a camp bed with a straw mattress.\n\nWhile the state rooms occupied the northern and eastern wings of the palace and the private rooms of the Imperial Family occupied the western wing, the four corners of the building contained the smaller rooms, which were the apartments of lesser members of the Imperial Family, often being of two floors. This is one of the reasons that the palace can appear a confusing assortment of great halls or salons with no obvious purpose located in odd corners of the palace. The fact that the Malachite Drawing Room is separated from the equally large Gold Drawing Room by a series of bedrooms and small cabinets initially seems unusual. However, when considered in the context that the Malachite Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the Empress' apartment while the Gold Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the apartment of her daughter-in-law, the Tsarevna, the arrangement of the rooms makes more sense. Similarly the vast White Hall, so far from the other grand halls, was in fact the principal hall of the Tsarevich's and Tsarevna's apartments. Thus the Winter Palace can be viewed as a series of small palaces within one large palace, with the largest and grandest rooms being public while the residents lived in suites of varying sizes, allocated according to rank.\n\nAs the formal home of the Russian Tsars, the palace was the setting for profuse, frequent and lavish entertaining. The dining table could seat 1000 guests, while the state rooms could contain up to 10,000 people—all standing, as no chairs were provided. These rooms, halls and galleries were heated to such a temperature that while it was sub-zero outside, exotic plants bloomed within, while the brilliant lighting gave the ambiance of a summer's day.\nGuests on ceremonial and state occasions would follow a set processional route, arriving at the palace courtyard through the central arch of the south façade, and then entering the palace through the state entrance (sometimes called the ambassadors' entrance) \"(38)\". They would then proceed through the colonnaded Jordan Hall before mounting the gilded Imperial staircase \"(8)\", from where the two enfilades of state rooms spread out. The principal or Jordan Staircase, so-called because on the Feast of the Epiphany, the Tsar descended in state for the ceremony of the Blessing of the Waters, is one of the few parts of the palace to retain the original 18th century rococo style, although the massive grey granite columns were added in the mid-19th century.\n\nOne of the most important rooms was the Palace's Grand Church \"(16)\". Granted cathedral status, it was of greater religious significance than the chapels of most European royal palaces. It was here that Romanov weddings were usually celebrated with a rigid and unchanging tradition and protocol. Even the bride's dress, and the manner of donning it, was dictated by tradition. Dressed by the Empress, the bride and her procession would pass from the Malachite Drawing Room to the church through the state rooms.\n\nThe Imperial Family were not the only residents of the palace; below the metal framework in the attics lived an army of servants. So vast were the servants' quarters that a former servant and his family, unbeknownst to the palace authorities, moved into the roof of the palace. They were only discovered by the smell of the manure from the cow that they had also smuggled into the building with them to provide fresh milk. It seems this cow was not the only bovine in the attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide fresh milk for the kitchens. This practice was discontinued after the 1837 fire.\n\nAfter the death of Catherine the Great, the Hermitage had become a private treasure house of the Tsars, who continued collecting, albeit not on the scale of Catherine the Great. In 1850, the collection of Cristoforo Barbarigo was acquired. This collection from Venice brought into the Winter Palace further works by Titian, in addition to many 16th-century Renaissance works of art.\n\nNicholas I, conscious of the great art galleries in other European capitals, saw that Catherine the Great's Large Hermitage \"(15)\" was vastly expanded and transformed into a purpose-built public art gallery. In 1839, German architect Leo von Klenze drew up the plans and their execution was overseen by Vasily Stasov, assisted by Alexander Briullov and Nikolai Yefimov. With so many architects involved there were inevitably many conflicts over the design and its execution throughout the 1840s, with the Tsar having frequently to act as moderator. Eventually, after eleven years of building and architectural conflict, the first art museum in Russia, the Imperial Hermitage Museum, opened on 5 February 1852. The trebeated facades of the building were inspired by Schinkelesque architecture. It was erected in grey marble round three courtyards and the complex is noted for the asymmetrical planning of its wings and floors. By order of the Tsar, visitors to the museum were required to wear evening dress, even in the morning. The Tsar also decreed that grey top hats were \"Jewish\" and dress coats \"revolutionary.\" Having negotiated the dress code, what the public saw was a huge array of art, but only a fraction of the Imperial collection, as the Winter Palace and other Imperial palaces remained closed to the viewing public.\n\nThe Winter Palace was an official residence of the Russian sovereign from 1732 until 1917; however, it was their home for little more than 140 of those years. The last Tsar to truly reside in the palace was Alexander II, who ruled from 1855 to 1881, when he was assassinated. During his reign there were more additions to the contents; acquisitions included the ancient and archaeological collection of the unfortunate Marchese di Cavelli in 1861 and Leonardo da Vinci's \"Madonna and Child\" in 1865; Leonardo's second work of that same name, the so-called \"Benois Madonna\", was later acquired in 1914.\n\nAlexander II was a constant target for assassination attempts, one of which occurred inside the Winter Palace itself. This attempt on the Tsar's life was organized by a group known as Narodnaya Volya (Will of the People) and led by an \"unsmiling fanatic\", Andrei Zhelyabov, and his mistress Sophia Perovskaya, who later became his wife. Perovskaya, the daughter of a former Governor of Saint Petersburg, was well placed to learn information concerning happenings within the palace and through her connections learnt of repairs being carried out in the palace's basement. One of the group, a trained carpenter, was subsequently enrolled as one of the workmen. Every day he carried dynamite charges concealed amongst his tools, placing them beneath the private dining room. So great was the quantity of dynamite that the fact there was an intervening floor between the dining room and the basement was of no significance. Plans were made to detonate the bomb on the evening of , assassinating the Tsar and Imperial family as they dined. Fortunately for the Romanovs, a guest arriving from Berlin was delayed, and for the first time in years dinner was delayed. As the family left the drawing room for the dining room the bomb exploded. So great was the explosion that it could be heard all over Saint Petersburg. The dining room was completely demolished and 11 members of the Finnish Guard in the Guard Room below were killed and a further 30 wounded. The incident represents one of the first uses of a time bomb for political purposes. The \"New York Times\" (March 4, 1880) reported \"the dynamite used was inclosed in an iron box, and exploded by a system of clockwork used by the man Thomas in Bremen some years ago.\"\n\nIn 1881, the revolutionaries were finally successful and Alexander II was assassinated as his carriage drove through the streets of Saint Petersburg. The Winter Palace was never truly inhabited again. The new Tsar Alexander III was informed by his security advisers that it was impossible to make the Winter Palace secure. The Imperial Family then moved to the seclusion of the Palace of Gatchina, some from Saint Petersburg. By comparison with the Winter Palace, the 600 room, moated Gatchina Palace, set within forests, was a cosy family home. When in Saint Petersburg, the Imperial Family resided at the Anichkov Palace, while the Winter Palace was used for official functions. Large economies were made in food and wine. The Tsar was highly interested in the running costs of the Palace, insisting that table linen was not to be changed daily, and that candles and soap were not replaced until completely spent. Even the number of eggs used in an omelette was reduced. While the Tsar economised on household expenses, he added to the Imperial art collection of both the palace and the Hermitage. Officially, the Hermitage Museum had an annual buying allowance of 5,000 rubles, but when this proved insufficient the Tsar would himself purchase items for the museum.\n\nEmpress Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark), the wife of Alexander III, saw that a garden was laid out in the centre of the main courtyard in 1885, an area previously cobbled and lacking vegetation. Court architect Nikolai Gornostayev designed a garden surrounded by a granite plinth and a fountain, and planted trees in the courtyard, laying limestone pavements along the walls of the palace.\n\nIn 1894, Alexander III was succeeded by his son Nicholas II. The last Tsar suspended court mourning for his father to marry his wife Alix of Hesse in a lavish ceremony at the Winter palace. However, after the ceremony the newlywed couple retired to the Anichkov Palace, along with the Dowager Empress. There they began their married life in six small rooms.\nIn 1895, Nicholas and Alexandra established themselves at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo. This was to be their favoured home for the remainder of the reign. However, from December 1895 they did reside for periods during the winter at the Winter Palace. Architect Alexander Krasovsky was commissioned to redecorate a suite of rooms in the north-west corner of the palace, including the Gothic library.\n\nIn 1896, the wife of Nicholas II was credited for the creation of another garden (35) on the former parade ground, beneath the windows of the Imperial Family's private apartments. She had found it disconcerting that the public could stare into her windows. The garden was created by landscape architect Georg Kuphaldt, the director of the Riga city gardens and parks. This is only one of two gardens which remain today at the palace.\n\nDuring the reign of Nicholas II, court life was quieter than it had ever been, due to the Tsaritsa's retiring nature and mistrust of Saint Petersburg's high society. In the Empress' opinion: \"Saint Petersburg is a rotten town, and not one atom Russian.\" Under her influence, gradually the great court receptions and balls at the Winter Palace, which humoured and cultivated the powerful nobility, came to an end. They were briefly replaced by theatricals held in the Hermitage which \"no one enjoyed\", then even the theatricals ceased.\n\nThe final great Imperial gathering at the Winter Palace was a themed fancy dress ball celebrating the reign of Alexei I, which took place on 11 and 13 February 1903 (1903 Ball in the Winter Palace). Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich recalled the occasion as \"the last spectacular ball in the history of the empire...[but] a new and hostile Russia glared through the large windows of the palace...while we danced, the workers were striking and the clouds in the Far East were hanging dangerously low.\" The entire Imperial family, the Tsar as Alexei I, the Empress as Maria Miloslavskaya, all dressed in rich 17th century attire, posed in the Hermitage's theatre, many wearing priceless original items brought specially from the Kremlin, for what was to be their final photograph together.\n\nIn 1904, Russia was at war with Japan, and the newborn Tsarevich was secretly ill; the Tsar and the Empress permanently abandoned Saint Petersburg, the Winter Palace, and high society (considered by the Empress to be decadent and immoral) for the greater comfort, security and privacy of Tsarskoe Selo. Thus it was that the Winter Palace, designed and intended to impress, reflect and reinforce the Romanovs' power, lost its raison d'être over a decade before the fall of the dynasty it was intended to house and glorify.\n\nFollowing the Imperial Family's move to the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo, the Winter Palace became little more than an administrative office block and a place of rare official entertaining. Throughout the year, the family moved from one palace to another: in March, to Livadia; in May to Peterhof (not the great palace, but a 19th-century villa in its grounds); in June, they cruised upon the Imperial Yacht, Standart; August was spent in Poland, at Spala, September was spent back at Livadia, before a return to Tsarskoe Selo for the Winter.\n\nThe Tsar betrayed his private views of Saint Petersburg in 1912, while addressing a farewell party of dignitaries and family bidding him farewell, as the family left for warmer climes: \"I am only sorry for you who have to remain in this bog.\" However, to the Tsar's ordinary subjects, the Winter Palace was seen not only as the home of the Tsars, but a symbol of Imperial power. In this role, it was to be at the centre of some of the most momentous happenings in Russia's early 20th century history. Three of these events stand out in Russia's history: The Bloody Sunday massacre of 1905; the opening of the first State Duma in 1906, which opened in St George's Hall (13); and finally the taking of the palace by revolutionaries in 1917.\n\nThe Bloody Sunday massacre was a result of the public ignorance of the Tsar's place of residence. It occurred on during a demonstration march by workers toward the Winter Palace. The closest shootings of demonstrators occurred near St. Isaac's Cathedral at the entrance to the Aleksandr Gardens leading to the Palace Square in front of the Winter Palace. The massacre was sparked when a Russian Orthodox priest and popular working class leader, Father Gapon, announced his intention to lead a peaceful protest of 100,000 unarmed striking workers to present a petition to the Tsar, to call for fundamental reforms and the founding of a constituent parliament. The protesters were unaware that the palace was little more than an uninhabited icon of Imperial power, and that the Tsar no longer resided there. The Tsar was not informed of the planned protest until the evening before, while no suggestion was made that the Tsar should meet a deputation or send representative to accept the petition. Instead, the Minister for the Interior drafted additional troops. As the strikers neared the palace bearing religious icons and singing the Imperial anthem, the Tsar's troops opened fire. While the number of casualties is disputed, moderate estimates average around 1,000 men, women and children killed or injured. The massacre, which came to be known as Bloody Sunday, was a serious blunder on the part of the Okhrana and was to have grave consequences for the Tsarist regime. It was also to be the catalyst for the 1905 Revolution.\n\nSubsequently, little changed politically in Russia during this period, and the Winter Palace remained in darkness. In 1913 the Romanov dynasty celebrated its tercentenary, but the crowds that flocked to see the processions were thin, the Empress appeared unhappy and the heir sick. The Tsar and Empress declined to hold a celebratory ball at the Winter Palace, instead holding two small receptions, both of which the Empress failed to attend. In 1914, Russia was forced to go to war as a result of the Triple Entente Alliance. The Tsar and Empress briefly returned to the Winter Palace to stand on their balcony to accept salutes and homage from the departing troops. Ironically, unlike the monarchs of Europe who stood on balconies adorned with velvet, flanked by their families, the Tsar and Empress stood, alone, in one corner of an unadorned balcony, appearing almost lost next to an oversized Imperial emblem, soon to be torn down by their own subjects. As the departing troops saluted their monarch in front of the palace, plans were being drawn up to store the palace's contents and convert the state rooms into a hospital to receive returning troops.\n\nIn the initial stages of the war, Russia endured heavy losses at the Masurian Lakes and Tannenberg and it was to the Winter Palace that many of the wounded returned. Rechristened the Tsarevich Alexey Nikolayevich Hospital, from October 1915, the palace was a fully equipped hospital, its staterooms transformed into hospital wards. The Fieldmarshals' Hall became a dressing station, the Armorial Hall an operating theatre. The small throne room became a doctor's mess room, while more lowly staff were accommodated in the Nicholas Hall and the Anteroom. Nurses were housed in the more intimate apartments once reserved for members of the extended Romanov family. The 1812 Gallery became a store room, the vestibule of the Jordan staircase the hospital's canteen, and its landings offices.\nAs the war went badly for Russia, its catastrophes were reflected in Saint Petersburg. The Tsar had decided to lead from the front, leaving the Empress to effectively rule Russia from Tsarskoe Selo. It was an unpopular move with both the Tsar's subjects and the Romanov family, as the Empress hired and fired indiscriminately often, it was supposed, on the advice of her favourite, Rasputin. Following Rasputin's murder by the Tsar's nephew-in-law in December 1916, the Empress' decisions and appointments became more erratic and the situation worsened and Saint Petersburg fell into the full grip of revolution.\n\nForced to accept the hopelessness of both the war and the situation at home, on 15 March 1917, Nicholas II abdicated in favour of his brother, Grand Duke Mikhail Alexandrovich. The Grand Duke promptly refused to accept the throne without the support of the army and his people. A provisional Government was appointed and many members of the former Imperial family were arrested, including the former Tsar, the Empress and their children. No member of the Romanov family have lived in the Winter Palace since the abdication in 1917 and very rarely did after 1905. Nicholas II, his wife and children were all held in captivity until they were murdered at Yekaterinburg in 1918. Other members of the former Imperial Family either met similar fates or escaped into exile.\n\nIt was this turbulent period of Russian history, known as the February Revolution, which for a brief time saw the Winter Palace re-established as a seat of government and focal point of the former Russian Empire. In February 1917, the Russian Provisional Government, led by Alexander Kerensky, based itself in the north west corner of the palace with the Malachite Room \"(4)\" being the chief council chamber. Most of the state rooms were, however, still occupied by the military hospital.\n\nIt was to be a short occupation of both palace and power. By 25 October 1917, the Provisional Government was failing and, realising the palace was a target for the more militant Bolsheviks, ordered its defence. All military personnel in the city pledged support to the Bolsheviks, who accused Kerensky's Government of wishing to \"surrender Petrograd to the Germans so as to enable them to exterminate the revolutionary garrison.\"\n\nThus the provisional government, assisted by a few remaining loyal servants, who had formerly served the Tsar, barricaded themselves in the palace. Many of the administrative staff fled, leaving the palace severely under-defended allegedly by some Cossacks, Cadets, and 137 female soldiers from the Women's Battalion. Food ordered by the occupants of the palace was commandeered by the Bolsheviks, and, in a state of siege, the Winter Palace entered the most turbulent period in its history. According to Soviet history, five thousand sailors newly arrived from Kronstadt were deployed to attack the palace, while the cruiser \"Aurora\" positioned itself on the Neva, all its guns trained towards the Palace. Across the water, the Bolsheviks captured the Peter and Paul Fortress and turned its artillery towards the besieged building. As the provisional Government, now impotent, hid in the private rooms of the former Imperial Family, nervously surveying the scenes outside, one by one the Government buildings in Palace Square surrendered to the Bolsheviks, leaving the palace seemingly only hours from destruction.\n\nAt 7:00 pm, the Government held its last meeting in the Malachite Room, with the telephone and all contact with the outside world disconnected. A short debate determined that they would not leave the palace to attempt dialogue with the hostile crowds outside. With the palace completely surrounded and sealed, the Aurora began her bombardment of the great Neva façade as the Government refused an ultimatum to surrender. Further machine gun and light artillery fire were directed at the palace as the Bolsheviks gained entry via His Majesty's own Staircase \"(36)\". In the ensuing battle there were casualties on both sides until the Bolsheviks finally, by 2:00 am, had control of the palace. Leaving a trail of destruction, they searched room after room before arresting the Provisional Government in the Small Dining Room of the private apartment \"(28)\", from where they were taken to imprisonment in the Fortress across the river. Kerensky managed to evade arrest and escape to Pskov, where he rallied some loyal troops for an attempt to retake the capital. His troops managed to capture Tsarskoe Selo, but were beaten the next day at Pulkovo.\nFollowing the Government's arrest, an alleged eye witness account by an unnamed source records that the Bolsheviks began rampaging:\n\nThe Winter Palace's wine cellars literally fuelled the weeks of looting and unrest in the city which followed. Arguably the largest and best stocked wine cellar in history, it contained the world's finest vintages, including the Tsar's favourite, and priceless, Chateau d’Yquem 1847. So keen were the mob to obtain the alcohol, that the Bolsheviks explored radical solutions to the problem, one of which involved piping the wine straight out into the Neva. This led to crowds clustering around the palace drains. Another proposal, deemed too risky, was exploding the cellars. Eventually, the problem was solved by the declaration of martial law. It has been said that Petrograd, \"perhaps with the biggest hangover in history, finally woke up and got back to some order.\"\n\nThe Winter Palace was now a redundant and damaged building symbolic of a despised regime, facing an uncertain future. \"The Storming of the Winter Palace\" was a historical reenactment organised by the Bolsheviks on the 3rd anniversary in 1920. With thousands of Red Guards led by Lenin, and witnessed by 100,000 spectators, the reenactment has become one of the \"best known\" events of the Russian Revolution.\n\nIronically, the Red Guard actually broke into the palace through a back door that was left open, guarded by wounded and disabled reserves. This gave rise to the occasion being described as the birth of the Soviet state. Nikolai Podvoisky, one of the original troika, which led the original storming, was so impressed by the re-enactment that he commissioned Sergei Eisenstein to make his film \"\". Certain features, such as the banks of floodlights which appear in Eisenstein's film indicate that Eisenstein was more influenced by the re-enactment than the original event.\n\nOn 30 October 1917, the palace was declared to be part of the Hermitage public museums. This first exhibition to be held in the Winter Palace concerned the history of the revolution, and the public were able to view the private rooms of the Imperial Family. This must have been an interesting experience for the viewing public, for while Soviet authorities denied looting and damage to the palace during the Storming, the Russian art connoisseur Alexander Alexandrovich Polovtsov, who visited these rooms immediately before and after the event, described the private apartments as the most badly damaged area of the palace. The contents of the state rooms had been sent to Moscow for safety when the hospital was established, and the Hermitage Museum itself had not been damaged during the revolution.\n\nFollowing the Revolution, there was a policy of removing all Imperial emblems from the palace, including those on the stonework, plaster-work and iron work. During the Soviet era, many of the palace's remaining treasures were dispersed around the museums and galleries of the Soviet Union. Some were sold for hard currency while others were given away to visiting dignitaries. As the original contents disappeared and other items from sequestered collections began to be displayed in the palace, the distinctions between the rooms' original and later use have become blurred. While some rooms have retained their original names, and some even the trappings of Imperial Russia, such as the furnishings of the Small and Large Throne Rooms, many other rooms are known by the names of their new contents, such as The Room of German Art.\n\nFollowing the 1941–1944 Siege of Leningrad, when the palace was damaged, a restoration policy was enacted, which has fully restored the palace. Furthermore, as the Russian Government does not categorically shun remnants of the Imperial Era as was the case during Soviet rule, the palace has since had the emblems of the Romanovs restored. The gilded and crowned double headed eagles once more adorn the walls, balconies and gates. The Winter Palace is no longer the hub of a great empire, and the Romanovs no longer reside there, but the crowned Russian eagle serves as a reminder of the palace's Imperial history.\n\nToday, as part of one of the world's best known museums, the palace attracts an annual 3.5 million visitors.\n\n\n"}
