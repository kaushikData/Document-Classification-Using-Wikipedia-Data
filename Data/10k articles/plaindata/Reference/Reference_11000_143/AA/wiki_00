Other demands called the government to respect the constitutional rights and freedoms, dismantling the privileges for Polish United Workers' Party members, and taking actions to improve the economic conditions of Polish citizens. The demands eventually led to the Gdańsk Agreement and creation of Solidarity.\n\nThe charter was written up on two wooden boards and hung on the gates of the shipyard on 18 August 1980. To mark the first anniversary of the August unrest, the demands were put on display in Gdańsk’s Maritime Museum. The day after Martial Law was declared one museum worker hid them in his loft, where they remained forgotten until 1996. Now added to the UNESCO Memory of the World Register, they can be found housed in Gdańsk’s Roads to Freedom exhibition.\n\n"}

Graham (United States)—authorized by Pope Paul VI in 1964, and published between 1965 and 1981.\n\nThe remainder of the documents from Pius XII's papacy may not be released for years; Bishop Sergio Pagano, the prefect of the Vatican Secret Archives announced in June 2009 that five or six years additional of preparation would be necessary to organize the papers, after which the decision to make further documents available to researchers will be the pope's. The completed catalog would include approximately 16 million documents from Pius XII's papacy (1939-1958), divided into approximately 700 boxes related to the Cardinal Secretary of State and the various nunciatures.\n\nThe collection is a rare exception to the Vatican's \"de facto\" seventy-five year rule for opening its archives, published in the aftermath of the controversial play, \"The Deputy\", by Rolf Hochhuth. The collection was intended to answer critics of Pius XII, such as Hochhuth, who alleged that the Pope had turned a blind eye to Nazi atrocities against Jews. In particular, the editors presented a variety of documents which they claim demonstrate how Pope Pius XII protested the persecution of and various deportations of Jews. \n\nFive of the eleven volumes deal with World War II, in chronological order. Four volumes deal with the humanitarian activities of the Holy See during the war, also in chronological order. One covers Pope Pius XII's letters to German bishops before and during the war. The last encompasses documents pertaining to Poland and Baltic countries.\n\nIn the \"Actes\", none of the documents—mostly in Italian—were translated from their original language. The introductions to the volumes and the brief descriptions preceding the documents are in French. Because the third volume contains two books, the ADSS are sometimes incorrectly referred to as a twelve-volume collection.\n\nThe editors describe the selected documents as a representative sample of Vatican activity during World War II; the four Jesuits claimed that only size constraints prevented them from publishing the full set of documents and that no new important revelations would accompany the eventual complete publication. \n\nAccording to the count of Australian historian Paul O'Shea, the ADSS contains 107 references to Jews prior to December 1942, and substantially more thereafter; a variety of other studies have extensively listed the data received by the Vatican on the nature and extent of the atrocities throughout Europe, as can be confirmed by the ADSS.\n\nIn his article for the Vatican newspaper, \"L'Osservatore Romano\" (April 29, 1998), Father Pierre Blet, the last surviving editor of the series, defended the integrity of the collection. \"In the first place, it is not clear exactly how the omission of certain documents would help to exonerate Pius XII from the omissions alleged against him,\" Blet wrote. \"On the other hand, to say in peremptory tones that our publication is incomplete is tantamount to asserting what cannot be proved: to this end it would be necessary to compare our publication with the archives and show which documents in the archives are missing from our publication.\" Blet added that he and three other Jesuits \"did not deliberately overlook any significant document, because we would have considered it harmful to the Pope's image and the Holy See's reputation.\"\n\nThe four Jesuit editors also wrote many articles derived from these primary sources, most of which were published in \"La Civiltà Cattolica\", an Italian-language Jesuit journal.\n\nBlet's \"Pius XII and the Second World War : According to the Archives of the Vatican\" (1999) represents his interpretation of what essential conclusions can be drawn from the eleven volume collection.\n\nRobert A. Graham's research did not stop with the publication of the ADSS; he continued to seek out primary sources within and without the Vatican and interview contemporaries almost until his death. He retired to California, taking his considerable body of records with him; this collection was made open to the public (although rarely actually used) until his death, at which point the Vatican had all the papers returned to Rome and sealed.\n\nAs of 2002, only one of the volumes had been translated into English. In 2012, M. Mallory published an English translation of some of the documents.\n\n\n"}

The artwork is located on the grounds at and in the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., United States. The word \"agricola\" means \"farmer\" in Latin. This work is the first in the \"Agricola\" series by Smith.\n\n\"Agricola I\" is a painted steel sculpture made of old farm machinery which have been assembled to appear as a farmer holding a tool in each hand.\n\nThe sculpture was originally purchased in 1962 from Park International in New York City. In 1966 the Hirshhorn Museum's namesake, Joseph H. Hirshhorn gave the work to the museum.\n\nThe \"Agricola\" series includes other works utilizing old farm equipment. The series of sixteen sculptures, made between 1950 and 1957, represent Smith's concern with farming in upper New York State where he lived.\n\nThe sculpture has been described by curators at the National Gallery of Art as \"making a direct reference\" to \"Mercury\" as attributed to Adrian de Vries and \"that this \"Mercury\" variation is not an isolated instance in Smith's career,\" referring to other works such as \"Circles\", \"Wagons\" and \"Sentinels\" by Smith, which are all variations upon work by another artist. Deemed a \"parody\" by The Washington Post, in the catalog of the National Gallery's 1982-1983 exhibition, \"David Smith,\" \"Agricola\" is renamed \"\"Mercury\" variant\" for the duration of the publication. In 1982, NGA curator E.A. Carmean Jr., stated that the Hirshhorn's \"Agricola I\" was a must have for NGA if the work was ever to be deaccessioned. Art historian and critic Rosalind Krauss describes \"Agricola I\" as being \"a hieratic image, rigid, frontal, and planar to the point of existing almost solely as a silhouette; whereas \"Mercury\" is a Mannerist work of combined elegance and muscularity...\" She also points out that \"Mercury\" has nothing to do with the agricultural theme of \"Agricola I\".\n\nArt historian Sam Hunter described the \"Agricola\" series as \"an abrasive, unadorned \"art brut\" of laconic gesture, almost no discernible style, and yet of an extraordinary lyric intensity.\" The Independent stated that the \"Agricola\" series depicts \"primitive figures seem on their way to work the land, but it is hard to tell where the farmers end and where their tools begin.\" In a 1982 review of the National Gallery exhibition, The New York Times called the \"Agricola\" series \"elegantly wrought\" and as \"giving everyday forms a metaphorical unity,\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20723531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20723531", "title": "Application for employment", "text": "Application for employment\n\nAn application for employment is a standard business document which is prepared with questions deemed relevant by an employer in order for the employer to determine the best candidate to be given the responsibility of fulfilling the work needs of the company. Most companies provide such forms to anyone upon request at which point it becomes the responsibility of the applicant to complete the form and returning it to the employer at will for consideration. The completed and returned document notifies the company of the applicants availability and desire to be employed and their qualifications and background so a determination can be made as to which candidate should be hired.\n\nFrom the employer's perspective, the application serves a number of purposes. These vary depending on the nature of the job and the preferences of the person responsible for hiring, as \"each organization should have an application form that reflects its own environment\". At a minimum, an application usually requires the applicant to provide information sufficient to demonstrate that he or she is legally permitted to be employed. The typical application also requires the applicant to provide information regarding relevant skills, education, and experience (previous employment or volunteer work). The application itself is a minor test of the applicant's literacy, penmanship, and communication skills - a careless job applicant might disqualify themselves with a poorly filled-out application.\n\nThe application may also require the applicant to disclose any criminal record, and to provide information sufficient to enable the employer to conduct an appropriate background check. For a business that employs workers on a part-time basis, the application may inquire as to the applicant's specific times and days of availability, and preferences in this regard. It is important to note, however, that an employer may be prohibited from asking applicants about characteristics that are not relevant to the job, such as their political view or sexual orientation.\n\nFor white collar jobs, particularly those requiring communication skills, the employer will typically require applicants to accompany the form with a cover letter and a résumé. However, even employers who accept a cover letter and résumé will frequently also require the applicant to complete a form application, as the other documents may neglect to mention details of importance to the employers. In some instances, an application is effectively used to dissuade \"walk-in\" applicants, serving as a barrier between the applicant and a job interview with the person with the authority to hire.\n\nFor many businesses, applications for employment can be filled out online, and do not have to be submitted in person. However, it is still recommended that applicants bring a printed copy of their application to an interview.\n\nApplication blanks are the second most common hiring instrument next to personal interviews. Companies will occasionally use two types of application blanks, short and long. They both help companies with initial screening and the longer form can be used for other purposes as well. The answers that applicants choose to submit are helpful to the company because they can become an interview question for that applicant at a future date.\n\nThe employment application is not a standardized form so every company may create its own as long as regulations set by the government are adhered. \n\nApplications usually ask the applicant at the minimum for their name, phone number, and address. In addition, applications also ask for previous employment information, educational background, emergency contacts, references, as well as any special skills the applicant might have.\n\nThe three categories application fields are very useful for discovering are; physical characteristics, experience, and environmental factors.\n\nIf the company has a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) to ask regarding a physical condition, they may ask questions about it, for example:\n\nExperience requirements can be separated into two groups on an application, work experience and educational background. Educational background is important to companies because by evaluating applicants' performance in school tells them what their personality is like as well as their intelligence. Work experience is important to companies because it will inform the company if the applicant meets their requirements. Companies are usually interested when applicants were unemployed and when/why the applicant left their previous job.\n\nCompanies are interested in the applicant's social environment because it can inform them of their personality, interests, and qualities. If they are extremely active within an organization, that may demonstrate their ability to communicate well with others. Being in management may demonstrate their leadership ability as well as their determination and so on.\n\nCustoms vary internationally when it comes to the inclusion or non-inclusion of a photograph of the applicant. In the English-speaking countries, notably the United States, this is not customary, and books or websites giving recommendations about how to design an application typically advise against it unless explicitly requested by the employer. In other countries, for instance Germany, the inclusion of a photograph of the applicant is still common, and many employers would consider an application incomplete without it.\n\nIn France, the requires companies with more than 50 employees to request an anonymous application (\"\").\n\nThe job application is called \"Bewerbung\" in Germany and usually consists of three parts, such as the \"Anschreiben\", the \"Lebenslauf\" and the \"Zeugnisse\". \"Anschreiben\" is the German word for Cover Letter and aims at the same goal: convincing the employer to submit an invitation for a job interview. It is essential to work with the paper size DIN A4 and to stay with a length of one single page. The \"Anschreiben\" must be signed by hand and accompanied by a \"Lebenslauf\", the Curriculum Vitae, and \"Zeugnisse\" as copies of relevant reference documents. The \"Lebenslauf\" is of an anti-chronological structure and should give information on work experience, education and professional training as well as on applicant's skills. In Germany, the \"Lebenslauf\" – respectively the Curriculum Vitae – usually includes a photograph called \"Bewerbungsfoto\". Some employers, mainly governmental organisations, deliberately neglect the photograph to ensure a higher degree of objectivity in the course of assessment procedures. A length of two pages is to be aimed at when generating the \"Lebenslauf\". In general, there are two options of submitting a job application in Germany: a job application folder (\"Bewerbungsmappe\") or online (\"Onlinebewerbung\"). According to a study, the \"Onlinebewerbung\" was more favored in Germany than the \"Bewerbungsmappe\" by 2012. Presumably, this development will persist..\n\nThe CV is the most important part of the application and should not be longer than two to three pages. It is divided into three areas:\n\nin chronological order\n\nin anti-chronological order\n\nThe application letter (La Lettera di accompagnamento al curriculum) will be taken relatively short, polite and formal in Italian applications. Long versions and extensively explained motivations, as well as photos and copies of certificates shall be presented only at the interview.\n\nIn Spain, the application consists of two parts: the cover letter (\"Carta de Candidatura\") and the CV. No work or training certificates are attached. The cover letter should contain information on the motivation and drafted shortly. The CV should be structured in a tabular form. In Spain, multiple job interviews in the same company are common.\n\nJob applications are known to be used by hackers to get employees to open attachments or links or connect USB sticks with malware. As companies typically have more financial resources than private individuals they are often a target of cyberextortion − so called ransomware. Ransomware such as \"Petya\" and \"GoldenEye\" were found to make use of job applications. Cyberespionage and attacks on critical infrastructure-related companies may be other reasons for such attacks and other than ransomware attacks may leave employees in the dark about their computer or network infection. The best method for mitigating such risks would be to have the HR department use a separate computer for job applications that is entirely disconnected from the internal network, on which no confidential or valuable information is stored and to which no portable devices such as USB sticks that may get connected to other computers of the company are connected.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "486709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=486709", "title": "Browser wars", "text": "Browser wars\n\nA browser war is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. The First Browser War was Microsoft's Internet Explorer against Netscape's Navigator during the late 1990s. Browser wars continued with the decline of Internet Explorer's market share since 2003 and the increasing popularity of other browsers including Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera.\n\nWith the introduction of HTML5 and CSS 3, a new generation of browser war began, this time adding extensive client-side scripting to the World Wide Web, as well as more widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices for browsing the web. These newcomers have ensured that browser battles continue among enthusiasts, while the average web user is less affected by their choice of browser.\n\nThe World Wide Web is an Internet-based hypertext system invented in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee. Berners-Lee wrote the first web browser WorldWideWeb, later renamed Nexus, and released it for the NeXTstep platform in 1991.\n\nBy the end of 1992 other browsers had appeared, many of them based on the libwww library. These included Unix browsers such as Line Mode Browser, ViolaWWW, Erwise, and MidasWWW, and MacWWW/Samba for the Mac. Even though these browsers tended to be simple HTML viewers, relying on external helper applications to view multimedia content, they provided choice to users both in browsers and platforms.\n\nFurther browsers were released in 1993, including Cello, Arena, Lynx, tkWWW, and Mosaic. The most influential of these was Mosaic, a multiplatform browser developed at National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). By October 1994, Mosaic was \"well on its way to becoming the world's standard interface\", according to Gary Wolfe of \"Wired\".\n\nSeveral companies licensed Mosaic to create their own commercial browsers, such as AirMosaic and Spyglass Mosaic. One of the Mosaic developers, Marc Andreessen, co-founded the Mosaic Communications Corporation and created a new web browser named Mosaic Netscape.\n\nTo resolve legal issues with NCSA, the company was renamed Netscape Communications Corporation and the browser Netscape Navigator. The Netscape browser improved on Mosaic's usability and reliability and was able to display pages as they loaded. By 1995, helped by the fact that it was free for non-commercial use, the browser dominated the emerging World Wide Web.\n\nOther browsers launched during 1994 included IBM Web Explorer, Navipress, SlipKnot, MacWeb, and Browse.\n\nIn 1995, Netscape faced new competition from OmniWeb, WebRouser, UdiWWW, and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 1.0, but continued to dominate the market.\n\nBy mid-1995 the World Wide Web had received a great deal of attention in popular culture and the mass media. Netscape Navigator was the most widely used web browser and Microsoft had licensed Mosaic to create Internet Explorer 1.0, which it had released as part of the Microsoft Windows 95 Plus! pack in August.\n\nInternet Explorer 2.0 was released as a free download three months later. Unlike Netscape Navigator, it was available to all Windows users free of charge, this also applying to commercial companies. Other companies later followed suit and released their browsers free of charge. Both Netscape Navigator and competitor products like InternetWorks, Quarterdeck Browser, InterAp, and WinTapestry were bundled with other applications to full Internet suites. New versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape (branded as Netscape Communicator) were released at a rapid pace over the following few years.\n\nDevelopment was rapid and new features were routinely added, including Netscape's JavaScript (subsequently replicated by Microsoft as JScript) and proprietary HTML tags such as codice_1 and codice_2.\n\nInternet Explorer began to approach feature parity with Netscape with version 3.0 (1996), which offered scripting support and the market's first commercial Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) implementation.\n\nIn October 1997, Internet Explorer 4.0 was released. The release party in San Francisco featured a ten-foot-tall letter \"e\" logo. Netscape employees showing up to work the following morning found the logo on their front lawn, with a sign attached that read \"From the IE team ...\" The Netscape employees promptly knocked it over and set a giant figure of their Mozilla dinosaur mascot atop it, holding a sign reading \"Netscape 72, Microsoft 18\" representing the market distribution.\n\nInternet Explorer 4 changed the tides of the browser wars. It was integrated into Microsoft Windows, which gave it a large installation base.\n\nDuring these releases, it was common for web designers to display 'best viewed in Netscape' or 'best viewed in Internet Explorer' logos. These images often identified a specific browser version and were commonly linked to a source from which the stated browser could be downloaded. These logos generally recognized the divergence between the standards supported by the browsers and signified which browser was used for testing the pages. In response, supporters of the principle that web sites should be compliant with World Wide Web Consortium standards and hence viewable with any browser started the \"Viewable With Any Browser\" campaign, which employed its own logo similar to the partisan ones. Most mainstream web sites, however, specified one of Netscape or IE as their preferred browser while making some attempt to support minimal functionality on the other.\n\nMicrosoft had three strong advantages in the browser wars.\n\nOne was resources: Netscape began with about 80% market share and a good deal of public goodwill, but as a relatively small company deriving the great bulk of its income from what was essentially a single product (Navigator and its derivatives), it was financially vulnerable. Netscape's total revenue never exceeded the interest income generated by Microsoft's funds that were readily available for use. Microsoft's resources allowed them to make Internet Explorer available without charge, as the revenues from Windows were used to fund its development and marketing. Netscape was commercial software for businesses, but was provided free for home and educational use; Internet Explorer was provided free for all Windows and Macintosh users, cutting off a significant revenue stream; as it was told by Jim Barksdale, President and CEO of Netscape Communications: \"Very few times in warfare have smaller forces overtaken bigger forces...\".\n\nAnother advantage was that Microsoft Windows had over 90% share of the desktop operating system market. Internet Explorer was bundled with every copy of Windows, therefore Microsoft was able to obtain an advantage the market share more easily than Netscape, as customers had Internet Explorer as the default browser. In this time period, many new computer purchases were first computer purchases for home users or offices, and many of the users had never extensively used a web browser before. Consequently, the buyer did not have anything else to compare with and little motivation to consider alternatives; the set of abilities they had gained with access to the Internet and the World Wide Web made any difference in browser features or ergonomics pale in comparison.\n\nDuring the United States Microsoft antitrust case in 1998, government witness and Intel vice president Steven McGeady testified that a senior executive at Microsoft told him in 1995 of his company's intention to \"cut off Netscape's air supply\", although a Microsoft attorney rejected McGeady's testimony as not credible. That same year, Netscape, the company, was acquired by America Online for US$4.2 billion. Internet Explorer became the new dominant browser, attaining a peak of about 96% of the web browser usage share during 2002.\n\nThe first browser war ended with Internet Explorer having no remaining serious competition for its market share. This also brought an end to the rapid innovation in web browsers; until 2006 there was only one new version of Internet Explorer since version 6.0 had been released in 2001. Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 1 was developed as part of Windows XP Service Pack 1 and was also integrated into Windows Server 2003. Further enhancements were made to Internet Explorer in Windows XP Service Pack 2 (released in 2004), including a pop-up blocker and stronger default security settings regarding the installation of ActiveX controls.\n\nAt the start of Netscape Navigator's decline, Netscape open-sourced their browser code, and later entrusted it to the newly formed non-profit Mozilla Foundation—a primarily community-driven project to create a successor to Netscape. Development continued for several years with little widespread adoption until a stripped-down browser-only version of the full suite, which included new features such as a separate search bar (which had previously only appeared in the Opera browser), was created. The browser-only version was initially named \"Phoenix\", but because of trademark issues that name was changed, first to \"Firebird\", then to \"Firefox\". This browser became the focus of the Mozilla Foundation's development efforts and Mozilla Firefox 1.0 was released on November 9, 2004. It then continued to gain an increasing share of the browser market until a peak in 2010.\n\nIn 2003, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 would be the last standalone version of its browser. Future enhancements would be dependent on Windows Vista, which would include new tools such as the WPF and XAML to enable developers to build web applications.\n\nIn response, in April 2004, the Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software joined efforts to develop new open technology standards which add more capability while remaining backward-compatible with existing technologies. The result of this collaboration was the WHATWG, a working group devoted to the fast creation of new standard definitions that would be submitted to the W3C for approval.\n\nThe growing number of device/browser combinations in use, legally-mandated web accessibility, as well as the expansion of expected web functionality to essentially require DOM and scripting abilities, including AJAX, made web standards of increasing importance during this era. Instead of touting their proprietary extensions, browser developers began to market their software based on how closely it adhered to the behavior as specified by the standard.\n\nOn February 15, 2005, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer 7 would be available for Windows XP SP2 and later versions of Windows by mid-2005. The announcement introduced the new version of the browser as a major upgrade over Internet Explorer 6 SP1.\n\nOpera had been a long-time small player in the browser wars, known for introducing innovative features such as tabbed browsing and mouse gestures, as well as being lightweight but feature-rich. The software, however, was commercial, which hampered its adoption compared to its free rivals until 2005, when the browser became freeware. On June 20, 2006, Opera Software released Opera 9 including an integrated source viewer, a BitTorrent client implementation, and widgets. It was the first Windows browser to pass the Acid2 test. Opera Mini, a mobile browser, has significant mobile market share. Editions of Opera are also available for the Nintendo DS and the Wii.\n\nMicrosoft released Internet Explorer 7 on October 18, 2006. It included tabbed browsing, a search bar, a phishing filter, and improved support for web standards (including full support for PNG)—all features already long familiar to Opera and Firefox users. Microsoft distributed Internet Explorer 7 to genuine Windows users (WGA) as a high-priority update through Windows Update. Typical market share analysis showed only a slow uptake of Internet Explorer 7 and Microsoft decided to drop the requirement for WGA and made Internet Explorer 7 available to all Windows users in October 2007. Throughout the two following years, Microsoft worked on Internet Explorer 8. On December 19, 2007, the company announced that an internal build of that version had passed the Acid2 CSS test in \"IE8 standards mode\"—the last of the major browsers to do so. Internet Explorer 8 was released on March 19, 2009. New features included accelerators, improved privacy protection, a compatibility mode for pages designed for older browsers, and improved support for various web standards. It was the last version of Internet Explorer to be released for Windows XP. Internet Explorer 8 scored 20/100 in the Acid3 test, which was much worse than all major competitors at the time.\n\nOn October 24, 2006, Mozilla released Mozilla Firefox 2.0. It included the ability to reopen recently closed tabs, a session restore feature to resume work where it had been left after a crash, a phishing filter, and a spell-checker for text fields. Mozilla released Firefox 3.0 on June 17, 2008, with performance improvements and other new features. Firefox 3.5 followed on June 30, 2009, with further performance improvements, native integration of audio and video, and more privacy features.\n\nApple created forks of the open-source KHTML and KJS layout and JavaScript engines from the KDE Konqueror browser in 2002. They explained that those provided a basis for easier development than other technologies by virtue of being small (fewer than 140,000 lines of code), cleanly designed, and standards-compliant. The resulting layout engine became known as WebKit and it was incorporated into the Safari browser that first shipped with Mac OS X v10.3. On June 13, 2003, Microsoft said it was discontinuing Internet Explorer on the Mac platform and on June 6, 2007, Apple released a beta version of Safari for Microsoft Windows. On April 29, 2010, Steve Jobs wrote open letter regarding his Thoughts on Flash, and the place it would hold on Apple's iOS devices and web browsers. Web developers were tasked with updating their web sites to be mobile friendly, and while many disagreed with Steve Jobs's assessment on Adobe Flash, history would soon prove his case in point with notable mentions of poor performance of Flash on Android devices. HTML4 and CSS2 were the standard in most browsers in 2006. However, new features being added to browsers from HTML5 and CSS3 specifications were quickly making their mark by 2010, especially in the emerging mobile browser market where new ways of animating and rendering for various screen sizes were to become the norm. Accessibility would also become a key player for the mobile web.\n\nOn December 28, 2007, Netscape announced that support for its Mozilla-derived Netscape Navigator would be discontinued on February 1, 2008, suggesting its users migrate to Mozilla Firefox.\nHowever, on January 28, 2008, Netscape announced that support would be extended to March 1, 2008, and mentioned Flock alongside Firefox as alternatives to its users.\n\nGoogle released the Chrome browser for Microsoft Windows on December 11, 2008, using the same WebKit rendering engine as Safari and a faster JavaScript engine called V8. Shortly after, an open-sourced version for the Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms was released under the name Chromium. According to Net Applications, Chrome had gained a 3.6% usage share by October 2009. After the release of the beta for Mac OS X and Linux, the market share had increased rapidly.\n\nDuring December 2009 and January 2010, \"StatCounter\" reported that its statistics indicated that Firefox 3.5 was the most popular browser, when counting individual browser versions, passing Internet Explorer 7 and 8 by a small margin. This was the first time a global statistic has reported that a non-Internet Explorer browser version had exceeded the top Internet Explorer version in usage share since the fall of Netscape Navigator. This feat, which GeekSmack called the \"dethroning of Microsoft and its Internet Explorer 7 browser,\" could largely be attributed to the fact that it came at a time when version 8 was replacing version 7 as the dominant Internet Explorer version. No more than two months later Internet Explorer 8 had established itself as the most popular browser version, a position which it still held as of March 2011. And other major statistics, such as Net Applications, never reported any non-Internet Explorer browser version as having a higher usage share than the most popular Internet Explorer version, although Firefox 3.5 was reported as the third most popular browser version between December 2009 and February 2010, to be replaced by Firefox 3.6 since April 2010, each ahead of Internet Explorer 7 and behind Internet Explorer 6 and 8.\n\nOn January 21, 2010, Mozilla released Mozilla Firefox 3.6, which allows support for a new type of theme display, 'Personas', which allows users to change Firefox's appearance with a single click. Version 3.6 also improves JavaScript performance, overall browser responsiveness, and startup times.\n\nIn October 2010, StatCounter reported that Internet Explorer had for the first time dropped below 50% market share to 49.87% in their figures. Also, StatCounter reported Internet Explorer 8's first drop in usage share in the same month.\n\nGoogle released Google Chrome 9 on February 3, 2011. New features introduced included support for WebGL, Chrome Instant, and the Chrome Web Store. The company created another seven versions of Chrome that year, finishing with Chrome 16 on December 15, 2011. The first version of Chrome available to the public in 2012 was Chrome 17, which was released on February 15, 2012. In April 2012, Google browsers (Chrome and Android) became the most used browsers on Wikimedia Foundation sites. By May 21, 2012, StatCounter reported Chrome narrowly overtaking Internet Explorer as the most used browser in the world.\nHowever, troughs and peaks in the market share between Internet Explorer and Chrome meant that Internet Explorer was slightly ahead of Chrome on weekdays up until July 4. At the same time, Net Applications reported Internet Explorer firmly in first place, with Google Chrome almost overtaking Firefox as the second. In 2012, responding to Chrome's popularity, Apple discontinued Safari for Windows.\n\nMicrosoft released Internet Explorer 9 on March 14, 2011. It featured a revamped interface, support for the basic SVG feature set, and partial HTML5 video support, among other new features. It only runs on Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Phone 7. The company later released Internet Explorer 10 along with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 in 2012, and an update compatible with Windows 7 followed in 2013. This version drops Vista and Phone 7 support. The release preview of Internet Explorer 11 was released on September 17, 2013. It supports the same desktops as its predecessor.\n\nThe concept of rapid releases established by Google Chrome prompted Mozilla to do the same for its Firefox browser. On June 21, 2011, Firefox 5.0 was the first rapid release for this browser, finished a mere six weeks after the previous edition. Mozilla created four more whole-number versions throughout the year, finishing with Firefox 9 on December 20, 2011. For those desiring long term support, Mozilla made an Extended Support Release (ESR) version of Firefox 10 on January 31, 2012. Contrary to the regular version, a Firefox ESR receives regular security updates plus occasional new features and performance updates for approximately one year, after which a 12-week grace period is given before discontinuing that version number. Those who continued to use the rapid releases with an active Internet connection were automatically updated to Firefox 11 on March 15, 2012. By the end of 2011 however Chrome overtook Firefox to become world's most used browser, and the competition between Chrome and Firefox intensified.\n\nDuring this era, all major web browsers implemented support for HTML5 video. Supported codecs, however, varied from browser to browser. Current versions of Android, Chrome, and Firefox support Theora, H.264, and the VP8 version of WebM. Older versions of Firefox omitted H.264 due to it being a proprietary codec, but it was made available beginning in version 17 for Android and version 20 for Windows. Internet Explorer and Safari support H.264 exclusively, but the Theora and VP8 codecs can be manually installed on the desktop versions. Given the popularity of WebKit for mobile browsers, Opera Software discontinued its own Presto engine in February 2013. The Opera 12 series of browsers were the last to use Presto with its successors using WebKit instead. In 2015, Microsoft discontinued production of newer versions of Internet Explorer. By this point Chrome overtook all other browsers as the browser with the highest usage share.\n\nStarting in 2015 with the release of Windows 10, Microsoft shifted from Internet Explorer to Microsoft Edge. However the new browser has failed to capture much popularity as of 2018.\n\nBy 2017 usage shares of Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer fell well below 5% each, while Google Chrome had expanded to over 60% worldwide. In May 26, 2017 Andreas Gal, former Mozilla CTO publicly stated that Google Chrome won the Second Browser War. As of July 2018, combining all types of devices using the internet, Google Chrome remains the most used browser across the world by a wide margin.\n\n\n"}

DNS-SD is typically used to present names of services (for example, printers or file servers) in user interfaces. DNS Long-Lived Queries (DNS-LLQ) can be used for DNS-SD to allow new services to appear automatically in an active user interface without requiring frequent polling. DNS-LLQ is being proposed in the IETF DNSSD working group as one option for providing service discovery in these routed networks. Although DNS LLQ over TCP/IP has not been standardized, it is in use in Apple Inc.'s current mDNS implementation.\n\nDNS LLQ is initiated by a client resolver that wishes to track one or more names in the DNS. The client resolver sends a registration message to a caching server, or to the authoritative server for the zone containing the name or names to be tracked. The query includes a lease; the tracking persists for the duration of the lease. If tracking is desired after the lease expires, the client resolver sends a new registration. The registration message includes a list of one or more queries. The server immediately returns the answers it has for these queries. For the duration of the lease, whenever the information covered by any of the queries changes, the server sends a \"gratuitous response\" containing new answers. Before the queries are answered and the lease recorded, the server and client perform a challenge/response exchange to validate the registration. Gratuitous answers are acknowledged by the client, and retransmitted if not acknowledged. After several tries, the server holding the registration will assume that the client resolver is no longer available, and will delete the registration.\n"}

{"id": "401763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=401763", "title": "Encyclopedism", "text": "Encyclopedism\n\nEncyclopedism is an outlook that aims to include a wide range of knowledge in a single work. The term covers both encyclopedias themselves and related genres in which comprehensiveness is a notable feature. The word encyclopedia is a Latinization of the Greek \"enkýklios paideía\", which means all-around education. The encyclopedia is \"one of the few generalizing influences in a world of overspecialization. It serves to recall that knowledge has unity,\" according to Lewis Shore, editor of \"Collier's Encyclopedia\". It should not be \"a miscellany, but a concentration, a clarification, and a synthesis\", according to British writer H.G. Wells.\n\nBesides comprehensiveness, encyclopedic writing is distinguished by its lack of a specific audience or practical application. The author explains facts concisely for the benefit of a reader who will then use the information in a way that the writer does not try to anticipate. Early examples of encyclopedic writing include discussions of agriculture and craft by Roman writers such as Pliny the Elder and Varro – discussions presumably not intended as practical advice to farmers or craftsmen.\n\nThe vast majority of classical learning was lost during the Dark Ages. This enhanced the status of encyclopedic works which survived, including those of Aristotle and Pliny. With the development of printing in the 15th century, the range of knowledge available to readers expanded greatly. Encyclopedic writing became both a practical necessity and a clearly distinguished genre. Renaissance encyclopedists were keenly aware of how much classical learning had been lost. They hoped to recover and record knowledge and were anxious to prevent further loss.\n\nIn their modern form, encyclopedias consist of alphabetized articles written by teams of specialists. This format was developed in the 18th century by expanding the technical dictionary to include non-technical topics. The \"Encyclopédie\" (1751–1772), edited by Diderot and D'Alembert, was a model for many later works. Like Renaissance encyclopedists, Diderot worried about the possible destruction of civilization and selected knowledge he hoped would survive.\n\nThe word \"encyclopedia\" is a Latinization of the Greek \"enkýklios paideía.\" The Greek phrase refers to the education that a well-round student should receive. Latin writer Quintilian uses it to refer to the subjects a student of oratory should be familiar with before beginning an apprenticeship. It translates literally as \"in (\"en\") the circle (\"kýklios\") of knowledge (\"paideía\").\" The earliest citation for \"encyclopedia\" given in \"Oxford English Dictionary\" refers to the Greek curriculum and is dated 1531.\n\nThe use of the term to refer to a genre of literature was prompted by a line that Pliny used in the preface of \"Natural History\": \"My object is to treat of all those things which the Greeks include in the Encyclopædia [\"tē̂s enkyklíou paideías\"], which, however, are either not generally known or are rendered dubious from our ingenious conceits.\" Pliny writes the relevant phrase using Greek letters. Latin printers of incunabula lacked the typeface to render it. Some printers substituted \"encyclopædia\" or another Latin phrase. Others just left a blank space. This led to the misunderstanding that Pliny had called his work an encyclopedia.\n\nIn the Renaissance, writers who wanted their work compared to that of Pliny used the word. In 1517, Bavarian Johannes Aventinus wrote \"Encyclopedia orbisqve doctrinarum,\" a Latin reference work. Ringelberg's \"Cyclopedia\" was published in 1541 and Paul Scalich's \"Encyclopedia\" in 1559. Both of these reference works were written in Latin. The French Encyclopédistes popularized the word in the 18th century.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\"'s first citation of \"enyclopedism\" is dated 1833. The context is a book on Diderot.\n\nThe Greek writer and teacher Aristotle (384–322 BC) had much to say on a broad range of subjects, including biology, anatomy, psychology, physics, meteorology, zoology, poetics, rhetoric, logic, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and political thought. He was among the first writers to describe how to classify material by subject, the first step in writing an encyclopedia. Aristotle wrote to help his students follow his teaching, so his corpus did not much resemble an encyclopedia during his lifetime. Long after his death, commentators filled in the gaps, reordered his works, and put his writing in a systematic form. Catalogs of his work were produced by Andronicus in the first century and by Ptolemy in the second century. As Aristotle's corpus was one of the few encyclopedic works to survive the Middle Ages, it became a widely used reference work in late medieval and Renaissance times.\n\nDorotheus (mid first century AD) and Pamphilus (late first century AD) both wrote enormous lexicons. Neither work has survived, but their lengths suggest that they were considerably more than just dictionaries. Pamphilus's work was 95 books long and was a sequel to a lexicon of four books by Zopyrion. This passage from the \"Souda\" suggests that it was made up of alphabetized entries:\nHesychius (fifth century) credits Diogenianus as a source, who in turn used Pamphilus. This is the only form in which any of Pamphilus's work may have survived.\n\nA Roman who wanted to learn about a certain subject would a send a slave to a private library with orders to copy relevant passages from whatever books were available. As they were less likely to withdraw or buy a book, readers were little concerned with the scope of a given work. So the emergence of encyclopedic writing cannot be explained by practical need. Instead, it may have been inspired by Cato's ideal of the \"vir bonus\", the informed citizen able to participate in the life of the Republic.\n\nThree Roman works are commonly identified as encyclopedic: The collected works of Varro (116–27 BC), Pliny the Elder's (c. 77–79 AD) \"Natural History\", and \"On the Arts\" by Cornelius Celsus (c. 25 BC – c. 50 AD). These three were grouped together as a genre, not by the Romans themselves, but by later writers in search of antique precedent.\n\nIn Cicero's time, the study of literature was still controversial. In \"Pro Archia\", Cicero explains that he studied literature to improve his rhetorical skills and because it provides a source of elevating moral examples. Varro's emphasis on the city's history and culture suggests patriotic motives. Pliny emphasized utilitarian motives and public service. He criticized Livy for writing history simply for his own pleasure.\n\nVarro's \"Antiquities\" consisted of 41 books on Roman history. His \"Disciplines\" was nine books on liberal arts. Varro also wrote 25 books on Latin and 15 on law. Only fragments of Varro's work survive. According to Cicero, Varro's comprehensive work allowed the Romans to feel at home in their own city.\n\nCelsus wrote prolifically on many subjects. \"Cornelius Celsus, a man of modest intellect, could write not only about all these arts but also left behind accounts of military science, agriculture, and medicine: indeed, he deserves, on the basis on this design alone, to be thought to have known all things,\" according to Quintilian. Only the medical section of his massive \"On the Arts\" has survived. This is eight books long. Celsus followed the structure of the medical writers that had gone before him. He summarized their views in a workmanlike manner. He seldom presented insights of his own. He struggled to manage the overwhelming quantity of relevant source material. His medical books were rediscovered in 1426-1427 at libraries in the Vatican and in Florence and published in 1478. He is our main source concerning Roman medical practices.\n\nIf Varro made the Romans feel at home their own city, Pliny tried to do the same for the natural world and for the Empire. Pliny's approach was very different than that of Celsus. He was a man ahead of his time. Not content to build on what went before, he reorganized the world of knowledge to fit his encyclopedic vision. In a Latin preface, the writer customarily listed the models he hoped to surpass. Pliny found no model in previous writing. Instead, he emphasized that his work was \"novicium\" (new), a word suitable for describing a major discovery. Although Pliny was widely read, no later Roman writer followed his structure or claimed him as a model. Niccolò Leoniceno published an essay in 1492 listing Pliny's many scientific errors.\n\nIn the introduction of \"Natural History\", Pliny writes:... in Thirty-six Books I have comprised 20,000 Things that are worthy of Consideration, and these I have collected out of about 2000 Volumes that I have diligently read (and of which there are few that Men otherwise learned have ventured to meddle with, for the deep Matter therein contained), and those written by one hundred several excellent Authors; besides a Multitude of other Matters, which either were unknown to our former Writers, or Experience has lately ascertained.\n\nWith an entire book dedicated to listing sources, \"Natural History\" is 37 books long. (It's 10 volumes in the modern translation.) Eschewing established disciplines and categories, Pliny begins with a general description of the world. Book 2 covers astronomy, meteorology, and the elements. Books 3–6 cover geography. Humanity is covered in Book 7, animals in Books 8–11, trees in 12–17, agriculture in 18–19, medicine in 20–32, metals in 33–34, and craft and art in 35–37.\n\nFollowing Aristotle, Pliny counts four elements: fire, earth, air and water. There are seven planets: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars (\"of a fiery and burning nature\"), the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon (\"the last of the stars\"). The earth is a \"perfect globe,\" suspended in the middle of space, that rotates with incredible swiftness once every 24 hours. As a good Stoic, Pliny dismisses astrology: \"it is ridiculous to suppose, that the great head of all things, whatever it be, pays any regard to human affairs.\" He considers the possibility of other worlds (\"there will be so many suns and so many moons, and that each of them will have immense trains of other heavenly bodies\") only to dismiss such speculation as \"madness.\" The idea of space travel is \"perfect madness.\"\n\nPliny had opinions on a wide variety of subjects often interjected them. He tells us which uses of plants, animals, and stone are proper, and which ones are improper. Was the Roman Empire benefiting or corrupting the classical world? Pliny returns to this theme repeatedly. He analogizes Rome's civilizing mission to the way poisonous plants of all nation were tamed into medicines. Pliny also wants us to know that he is a heroic explorer, a genius responsible for a highly original and most remarkable work. The extensive reading and note taking of his slave secretaries is rarely mentioned.\n\nAt the very end of the work, Pliny writes, \"Hail Nature, parent of all things, and in recognition of the fact that I alone have praised you in all your manifestations, look favorably upon me.\" Here Pliny points to comprehensiveness as his project's outstanding asset. Nature awarded Pliny a heroic death that gave him \"a kind of eternal life,\" according to his nephew. The great encyclopedist was commander of the Naples fleet and died trying to assist the local inhabitants during the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79.\n\nWhile classical and modern encyclopedic writers sought to distribute knowledge, those of the Middle Ages were more interested in establishing orthodoxy. They produced works to be used as educational texts in schools and universities. Students could consider the knowledge within them as safely orthodox and thus be kept from heresy. Limiting knowledge was an important part of their function.\n\nAs a Stoic, Pliny began with astronomy and ended with the fine arts. Cassiodorus attempted to write a Christian equivalent to Pliny's work. His \"Institutiones\" (560) begins with discussions of scripture and the church. Other subjects are treated briefly toward the end of the work. With onset of the Dark Ages, access to Greek learning and literacy in Greek declined. The works of Boethius (c. 480–524) filled the gap by compiling Greek handbooks and summarizing their content in Latin. These works served as general purpose references in the early Middle Ages.\n\n\"The Etymologies\" (c. 600–625) by Isidore of Seville consisted of extracts from earlier writers. Three of the Isidore's twenty books represent material from Pliny. Isidore was the most widely read and fundamental text in terms of medieval encyclopedic writing.\n\nThese early medieval writers organized their material in the form of a \"trivium\" (grammar, logic, rhetoric) followed by a \"quadrivium\" (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, music). This division of seven liberal arts was a feature of monastic education as well as the medieval universities, which developed beginning in the 12th century.\n\nThe main section of the \"Code of Justinian\", called the Pandects, was a legal reference of 50 books that was compiled by a commission of 16 lawyers led by Tribonian in 530 to 533. The Latin title \"Pandectēs\" (\"all-incompassing\") translates directly as \"encyclopedia.\" The work summarized judicial opinions on various issues, and is less grandly referred to as \"Digesta\" (legal digests). When Charlemagne conquered Italy in 800, he wished to revive Roman Law. But no copy of the Code could be found. A manuscript was discovered centuries later, (in 1136 in Amalfi, according to legend.)\n\nFrom the fourth to the ninth centuries, Byzantium experienced a series of religious debates. As part of these debates, excerpts were compiled and organized thematically to support the theological views of the compiler. Once orthodoxy was established, the energy of the compilation tradition transferred to other subjects. The tenth century, or Macedonian dynasty, saw a flowering of encyclopedic writing. Th \"Suda\" is believed to have been compiled at this time. This is the earliest work that a modern reader would recognize as an encyclopedia. It contains 30,000 alphabetized entries. The \"Suda\" is not mentioned until the 12th century, and it might have been put together in stages.\n\nThe most massive encyclopedia of the Middle Ages was \"Speculum Maius\" (\"The Great Mirror\") by Vincent of Beauvais. It was 80 books long and was completed in 1244. With a total of 4.5 million words, the work is presumably the product of an anonymous team. (By comparison, the current edition of \"Britanica\" has 44 million words.) It was divided into three sections. \"Naturale\" covered God and the natural world; \"Doctrinale\" covered language, ethics, crafts, medicine; and \"Historiale\" covered world history. Vincent had great respect for classical writers such Aristotle, Cicero, and Hippocrates. The encyclopedia shows a tendency toward \"exhaustiveness,\" or systemic plagiarism, typical of the medieval period. Vincent was used as a source by Chaucer. The full version of \"Speculum\" proved to be too long to circulate in the era of manuscripts and manual copying. However, an abridged version by Bartholomeaus Anglicus did enjoy a wide readership.\n\nThe Arab counterpart to these works was \"Kitab al-Fehrest\" by Ibn al-Nadim.\n\nThe nearest Chinese equivalent to an encyclopedia is the \"leishu\". These consist of extensive quotations arranged by category. The earliest known Chinese encyclopedia is \"Huang Lan\" (\"Emperor's mirror\"), produced around 220 under the Wei dynasty. No copy has survived. The best-known \"leishu\" are those of Li Fang (925–996), who wrote three such works during the Song dynasty. These three were later combined with a fourth work, \"Cefu Yuangui\", to create \"Four Great Books of Song\".\n\nWith the advent of printing and a dramatic reduction in paper costs, the volume of encyclopedic writing exploded in the Renaissance. This was an age of \"info-lust\" and enormous compilations. Many compilers cited the fear of a traumatic loss of knowledge to justify their efforts. They were keenly aware of how much classical learning had been lost in the Dark Ages. Pliny was their model. His axiom that, \"there is no book so bad that some good cannot be got from it\" was a favorite. Conrad Gesner listed over 10,000 books in \"Bibliotheca universalis\" (1545). By including both Christian and barbarian works, Gesner rejected the medieval quest for orthodoxy. Ironically, Jesuit Antonio Possevino used \"Bibliotheca universalis\" as a basis to create a list of forbidden books.\n\nThe invention of printing helped spread new ideas, but also revived old misconceptions. Printers of incunabulia were eager to publish books, both ancient and modern. The best-known encyclopedia of Elizabethan England was \"Batman upon Bartholomew\", published in 1582. This book is based on a work compiled by Bartholomaeus Anglicus in the 13th century. It was translated by John of Trevisa in 1398, revised by Thomas Berthelet in 1535, and revised again by Stephen Bateman. In Shakespeare's day, it represented a worldview already four centuries old, only modestly updated. Yet several ideas inspired by Bateman can be found in Shakespeare. The idea that the rays of the moon cause madness can be found \"Measure for Measure\" and \"Othello\", hence the word \"lunacy.\" The discussion of the geometric properties of the soul in \"King Lear\" is likely to reflect the influence of Bateman as well. An encyclopedia that Shakespeare consulted more obviously than Bateman is \"French Academy\" by Pierre de la Primaudaye. Primaudaye was much taken with analogies, some of which have found their way into Shakespeare: the unweeded garden, death as an unknown country, and the world as a stage. (Various other sources have also been suggested for the last analogy.) Both Bateman and Primaudaye were Protestant.\n\nFrancis Bacon wrote a plan for an encyclopedia in \"Instauratio magna\" (1620). He drew up a checklist of the major areas of knowledge a complete encyclopedia needed to contain. Bacon's plan influenced Diderot and thus indirectly later encyclopedias, which generally follow Diderot's scheme.\n\nWhile ancient and medieval encylopedism emphasized the classics, liberal arts, informed citizenship, or law, the modern encyclopedia springs from a separate tradition. The advance of technology meant that there was much unfamiliar terminology to explain. John Harris's \"Lexicon Technicum\" (1704) proclaims itself, \"An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves.\" This was the first alphabetical encyclopedia written in English. Harris's work inspired Ephraim Chambers's \"Cyclopedia\" (1728). Chambers's two-volume work is considered the first modern encyclopedia.\n\n\"Encyclopédie\" (1751–1777) was a massively expanded version of Chambers's idea. This 32-volume work, edited by Diderot and D'Alembert, was the pride of Enlightenment France. It consisted of 21 volumes of text and 11 volumes of illustrations. There were 74,000 articles written by more than 130 contributors. It presented a secular worldview, drawing the ire of several Church officials. It sought to empower its readers with knowledge and played a role in fomenting the dissent that led to the French Revolution. Diderot explained the project this way:\n\nThis is a work that cannot be completed except by a society of men of letters and skilled workmen, each working separately on his own part, but all bound together solely by their zeal for the best interests of the human race and a feeling of mutual good will.\n\nThis realization that no one person, not even a genius like Pliny assisted by slave secretaries, could produce a work of the comprehensiveness required, is the mark of the modern era of encyclopedism.\n\nDiderot's project was a great success and inspired several similar projects, including Britain's \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" (first edition, 1768) as well as Germany's \"Brockhaus Enzyklopädie\" (beginning 1808). Enlightenment encyclopedias also inspired authors and editors to undertake or critique \"encyclopedic\" knowledge projects in other genres and formats: the 65-volume Universal History (Sale et al) (1747-1768), for example, far exceeded its predecessors in terms of scope, and \"The General Magazine of Arts and Sciences\" (1755-1765) published by Benjamin Martin (lexicographer) sought to bring encyclopedism to the monthly periodical. A loyal subscriber, he wrote, would “be allowed to make a great Proficiency, if he can make himself Master of the useful Arts and Sciences in the Compass of Ten Years.” In Laurence Sterne's \"The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\" (1759-1767), the title character satirically refers to his fictional autobiography as a “cyclopædia of arts and sciences.\" Such \"experiments in encyclopedism\" demonstrate the widespread literary and cultural influence of the form in the 18th century.\n\nOnce solely for society's elites, in the 19th and 20th centuries encyclopedias were increasingly written, marketed to, and purchased by middle and working class households. Different styles of encyclopedism emerged which would target particular age groups, presenting the works as educational tools—even made available through payment plans advertised on TV.\n\nOne of the earliest individuals to advocate for a technologically enhanced encyclopedia indexing all the world's information was H. G. Wells. Inspired by the possibilities of microfilm, he put forward his idea of a global encyclopedia in the 1930s through a series of international talks and his essay \"World Brain\".\n\nIt would be another several decades before the earliest electronic encyclopedias were published in the 1980s and 1990s. The production of electronic encyclopedias began as conversions of printed work, but soon added multimedia elements, requiring new methods of content gathering and presentation. Early applications of hypertext similarly had a great benefit to readers but did not require significant changes in writing. The launching of Wikipedia in the 2000s and its subsequent rise in popularity and influence, however, radically altered popular conception of the ways in which an encyclopedia is produced (collaboratively, openly) and consumed (ubiquitously).\n\n"}

It is notable both for being one of the only social programs based in a randomized experiment, and the only anti-poverty housing program endorsed by the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations.\n\nThe ACLU-initiated 1966 class action lawsuit \"Dorothy Gautreaux v. Chicago Housing Authority\" (CHA) alleged that the CHA engaged in racial discrimination in public housing policy, as prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The lawsuit alleged that the CHA built public housing solely in areas with high concentrations of poor minorities, in violation of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) guidelines and the Civil Rights Act. The goal of the lawsuit was to begin building public housing in predominantly white neighborhoods.\nHUD entered as a party to the lawsuit, and the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 as \"Hills v. Gautreaux\" (425 U.S. 284).\n\nIn a consent decree, the court ordered the CHA to provide scattered-site housing for public housing residents currently residing in isolated public housing projects in concentrated areas of poverty.\nThe CHA distributed Section 8 housing vouchers to 7500 African American families on welfare in either suburban or urban locations. The Chicago Housing Authority designated a day on which Section 8 vouchers are distributed to the first several hundred callers. Applicants were screened by two standards—basic apartment maintenance and lack of a serious criminal record—and two-thirds of the applicants were accepted. Successful applicants were offered placement in private market apartment units in either city or suburban locations chosen at random by the CHA, and most accepted the placement. The program was intentionally low-profile: only a few participants are moved into each suburb in order to prevent white flight, and because the residents moved into private units, they had no external markers of being on welfare.\n\nThe suburban and urban participants started out identical: all were selected from the same pool of callers, and were randomly placed into private apartments in either suburban or urban locations. After several years, the suburban and urban participants had very different outcomes. The urban participants were likely to remain on the welfare rolls, but their suburban counterparts were very likely to find employment and leave welfare. The urban participants' children were likely to drop out of high school, but their suburban counterparts are likely to graduate from high school and even college. The program participants' children were initially below the academic level of their classmates, but because only a few families were moved to each suburbs, the suburban teachers could take time with each new child and tutor each child individually until the children were at the same level as their classmates.\n\nThe sociologist James Rosenbaum who studied the Gautreaux project testified before the US Congress on the success of the program, and it has become a model for similar programs in 33 metropolitan areas and inspired the national Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program.\n\nSome housing departments misinterpreted the results of the Gautreaux project, and used it as justification for emptying and demolishing public housing, as a result of which thousands of public housing residents at a time moved to the same suburbs and overwhelmed the suburbs' resources with urban problems. Gautreaux intentionally moved only a few public housing residents to each suburb.\n\n"}

Among the most notable are Bendigeidfran fab Llyr, a mythological king of Britain during the Second Branch of the Mabinogi, Idris Gawr of Cader Idris, and Ysbaddaden Bencawr, the chief antagonist of the early Arthurian tale \"How Culhwch won Olwen\". Both Arthur and Gwalchmai fab Gwyar feature prominently as giant-slayers in Welsh tradition.\n\nIn the Mabinogi of Branwen ferch Llyr, Britain is ruled by the giant Bran the Blessed, who has never been able to fit inside any dwelling. In \"Culhwch and Olwen\", giants feature as antagonists throughout. Ysbaddaden, chief of giants, is the father of Olwen, a beautiful maiden sought by Culhwch fab Cilydd, a cousin of King Arthur's. He is slain at the tale's close by his nephew Goreu fab Custennin, while Wrnach, another giant, is killed by Cei.\n\nA well-known tale concerns Rhitta (or Rhudda) Gawr, a giant who held court in Snowdonia. He marched against warring kings Nyniaw and Peibaw, overwhelmed their armies and took their beards as trophies of his victory and fashioned them into a cap for himself. The twenty-six kings of Britain assembled their armies to destroy Rhitta but were vanquished by the giant, who cut off the kings' beards and fashioned a great cape out of them to protect him from the cold. Sometime later, as Arthur \"washed his hands after slaying the red-eyed giant of Cernyw\", he received a message from Rhitta, demanding his beard to patch his cloak. Arthur refused, and Rhitta marched south with his armies to claim it from him. In the resulting confrontation, Rhitta is forced to shear his own beard, and retreats \"much humbled in stature but much wiser in knowledge\". A variant tale claims that after receiving the demands, Arthur marched furiously up to Snowdonia and fought against the giant in a duel, in which he \"lifted up his sword and struck Rhitta on the crown of the head a blow so fiercely-wounding, severely-venomous and sternly-smiting that it cut through all his head armour and his skin and his flesh and clove him in twain.\", According to the story, Arthur commands that a cairn be built over his body which forms Gwyddfa Rhudda (Rhita's Cairn). Over the intervening centuries the name of Rhudda was forgotten and Gwyddfa Rhudda became known as \"Yr Wyddfa\".\n\nMaelor Gawr, the giant of Castell Maelor (now the village of Penparcau), was captured in Cyfeilog, about twelve miles from his own castle and was sentenced to death. His enemies allowed him his final request to blow on his horn three times before his death. The first time he blew, his hair and beard fell out, and on the second blast of his horn, so great was the strength and force of the sounding that all his finger and toe-nails fell off completely. On the third blast of his horn the intensity of the force of the sound caused the horn to be broken into small pieces.\n\nMaelor's son, Cornippin, who was hunting with his horse and his hound, heard the sound of his father's hand and lamented over his suffering. He made to rescue his father and in riding with such haste and swiftness, he tore the head of his hound off its body. He spurred his horse onwards, leaped in one great bound over the Ystwyth river and attacked his father's captors. In the ensuing battle, Cornippin was slain.\n\nCribwr the Giant lived in Castell Cefn Cribwr in Morgannwg. His three sisters were all killed by Arthur through \"treachery\". Arthur succeeded in slaying the giantesses by nicknaming himself as \"Hot Pottage\" to the first sister, and \"Warm Porridge\" to the second sister and as \"a morsel of bread\" to the third, and when the first sister called for help against Hot Pottage Cribwr answered: Wench, let him cool; and in the same manner he answered the second sister, when she sought assistance against Warm Porridge. And the third sister called out that the Morsel of Bread was choking her; and to this he answered, Wench, take a smaller piece. And when Cribwr reproached Arthur for killing his sisters Arthur replied:\n\n\"Cribwr take thy combs\"\n\n\"And cease with currish anger\"\n\n\"If I get a real chance—surely\"\n\n\"What they have had, thou shalt have too.\"\n\nThe \"Historia Brittonum\" claims that Benlli Gawr was an early king of Powys, who was burned to death after acting aggressively towards Germanus of Auxerre.\n\nCanthrig Bwt, a giantess and witch notorious in the folklore of Gwynedd, lived under a great stone in Nant Peris and killed and ate a number of the community's children.\n\nGogfran the Giant is recorded in the Welsh Triads as the father of Gwenhwyfar, Arthur's third wife. A tale tells of the imprisonment of a number of his sons by the giants of Bron Wrgan, leading to Arthur's attack on the abode to free his brothers-in-law.\n\nThe traditional Welsh name for Stonehenge is Côr y Cewri or \"Council of the Giants\".\n"}

It serves as the \"lingua franca\" of the nation, with 98% of Bangladeshis fluent in Bengali (including dialects) as their first language. English, having no official status, is prevalent across government, law, business, media and education, and can be regarded as the de facto co-official language of Bangladesh (see Bangladeshi English). Hindi is understood by some as a foreign language.\n\nThe indigenous people of northern and southeastern Bangladesh speak a variety of native languages.\n\nThe lowlands of Bangladesh form the eastern half of the ethno-linguistic region of Bengal, and the Bengali language is spoken by the majority of the country's inhabitants. There are also some Eastern Indic language varieties, which are variously classified either as dialects of Bengali or separate but closely related languages. They can be thought of forming a dialect continuum.\n\nThe indigenous languages of the region are members of the Austroasiatic, Dravidian and Tibeto-Burman families. Most of these languages are spoken in mountainous areas.\n\nWhile the more widely spoken and better-known Austroasiatic languages are spoken in Southeast Asia (e.g. Khmer and Vietnamese), smaller languages of that family are spoken by indigenous communities of northern and eastern Bangladesh.\n\nTwo Dravidian languages are spoken by indigenous communities of western Bangladesh.\n\nThe mountainous areas along the northern and eastern edges of the Indian Subcontinent are inhabited primarily by speakers of Tibeto-Burman languages. Indigenous Tibeto-Burman-speaking communities are found through the northern, eastern, and especially the southeastern parts of Bangladesh.\n\nEnglish is a co-official language of Bangladesh and is widely used in the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Bangladesh's Constitution and laws were written in English and are now being re-written in the Bengali. It is also widely used in schools, colleges and universities as a medium of instruction.\n\nArabic (عربي) was an official language ever since the territory of the modern state People's Republic of Bangladesh became a part of the Bengal Sultanate. However some disagree and believe the presence of Arabic came before during the Delhi Sultanate. Arabic is used in many Muslim congregations such as the weekly Jumu'ah Salah in which a sermon (khutbah) is given in Arabic in addition to Bengali. In the Constitution of Bangladesh, there are two references to Arabic to in the introduction and Part I of the constitution. The document begins with the Arabic phrase بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ which is translated as “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful”. Article 2A declares that Islam is the state religion of the republic.\n\nArabic is the religious language of Muslims. The Quran, Sunnah, Hadith and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with Bengali translation. The Bangladeshi diaspora living in the Middle East has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Bangladesh. Arabic is taught as a religious language in mosques, schools, colleges, universities and madrassahs as well as in tradition Bengali Muslim households. A majority of Bangladesh's Muslim population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the Arabic language as part of their religious education.\n\n\nFrom ancient times Bengal and Persia had been in contact with each other. There were many trading posts around coastal Bengal. As people converted to Islam, they became acquainted with Arabic scriptures, as well as with Persian, the language of the Sufi preachers. The influence of the language spread rapidly after it gained the status of court language and it was the official for over 600 years (1203-1837 AD).\n\nUrdu (اردو‬) was an official language in East Pakistan. It is still spoken by the Biharis in Bangladesh and is taught in some madrasahs.\n\n\n"}

However, in such cases, any NIS(0307) client can retrieve the entire password database for offline inspection. Kerberos was designed to handle authentication in a more secure manner.\n\nThe original NIS design was seen to have inherent limitations, especially in the areas of scalability and security, so other technologies have come to replace it.\n\nSun introduced NIS+ as part of Solaris 2 in 1992, with the intention for it to eventually supersede NIS. NIS+ features much stronger security and authentication features, as well as a hierarchical design intended to provide greater scalability and flexibility. However, it was also more cumbersome to set up and administer, and was more difficult to integrate into an existing NIS environment than many existing users wished. NIS+ has been removed from Solaris 11.\n\nAs a result, many users chose to stick with NIS, and over time other modern and secure distributed directory systems, most notably Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), came to replace it. For example, codice_1 (the standalone LDAP daemon) generally runs as a non-root user, and SASL-based encryption of LDAP traffic is natively supported.\n\nOn large LANs, DNS servers may provide better nameserver functionality than NIS or LDAP can provide, leaving just site-wide identification information for NIS master and slave systems to serve. However, some functionssuch as the distribution of netmask information to clients, as well as the maintenance of e-mail aliasesmay still be performed by NIS or LDAP. NIS maintains an NFS database information file as well as so called maps.\n\n\n"}

He used Acacia Grove as a base for agricultural experiments, importing a wide variety of plants, especially apple varieties which he shared freely with area growers. When Prescott died in 1859, the house was purchased and maintained for several decades by the Kaye family. However later owners neglected the house and by the 1890s, it fell into ruin. In 1931 the property was purchased by Mary Allison Prescott, the great granddaughter of Charles Prescott. She restored the house and lived in it with her two sisters until 1970.

{"id": "97845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97845", "title": "Recipe", "text": "Recipe\n\nA recipe is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a culinary dish. It is also used in medicine or in information technology (user acceptance). A doctor will usually begin a prescription with \"recipe\", Latin for \"take\", usually abbreviated to Rx or an equivalent symbol (℞).\n\nThe earliest known written recipes date from approximately 1600 BC and come from an Akkadian tablet from southern Babylonia. There are also works in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs depicting the preparation of food.\n\nMany ancient Greek recipes are known. Mithaecus's cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost; Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his Deipnosophistae. Athenaeus mentions many other cookbooks, all of them lost.\n\nRoman recipes are known starting in the 2nd century BCE with Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura. Many authors of this period described eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and in Latin. Some Punic recipes are known in Greek and Latin translation.\n\nThe large collection of recipes \"De re coquinaria\", conventionally titled Apicius, appeared in the 4th or 5th century and is the only complete surviving cookbook from the classical world. It lists the courses served in a meal as Gustatio (appetizer), Primae Mensae (main course) and Secundae Mensae (dessert). Each recipe begins with the Latin command \"Take...,\" \"Recipe...\"\n\nArabic recipes are documented starting in the 10th century; see al-Warraq and al-Baghdadi.\n\nThe earliest recipe in Persian dates from the 14th century. Several recipes have survived from the time of Safavids, including \"Karnameh\" (1521) by Mohammad Ali Bavarchi, which includes the cooking instruction of more than 130 different dishes and pastries, and \"Madat-ol-Hayat\" (1597) by Nurollah Ashpaz. Recipe books from the Qajar period are numerous, the most notable being \"Khorak-ha-ye Irani\" by prince Nader Mirza.\n\nKing Richard II of England commissioned a recipe book called \"Forme of Cury\" in 1390, and around the same time, another book was published entitled \"Curye on Inglish\", \"cury\" meaning cooking. Both books give an impression of how food for the noble classes was prepared and served in England at that time. The luxurious taste of the aristocracy in the Early Modern Period brought with it the start of what can be called the modern recipe book. By the 15th century, numerous manuscripts were appearing detailing the recipes of the day. Many of these manuscripts give very good information and record the re-discovery of many herbs and spices including coriander, parsley, basil and rosemary, many of which had been brought back from the Crusades.\n\nWith the advent of the printing press in the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland and England, competition grew between the noble families as to who could prepare the most lavish banquet. By the 1660s, cookery progressed to an art form and good cooks were in demand. Many families published their own books detailing their recipes in competition with their rivals. Many of these books have been translated and are available online.\n\nBy the 19th century, the Victorian preoccupation for domestic respectability brought about the emergence of cookery writing in its modern form. Although eclipsed in fame and regard by Isabella Beeton, the first modern cookery writer and compiler of recipes for the home was Eliza Acton. Her pioneering cookbook, \"Modern Cookery for Private Families\" published in 1845, was aimed at the domestic reader rather than the professional cook or chef. This was immensely influential, establishing the format for modern writing about cookery. It introduced the now-universal practice of listing the ingredients and suggested cooking times with each recipe. It included the first recipe for Brussels sprouts. Contemporary chef Delia Smith called Acton \"the best writer of recipes in the English language.\" \"Modern Cookery\" long survived Acton, remaining in print until 1914 and available more recently in facsimile.\nActon's work was an important influence on Isabella Beeton, who published \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\" in 24 monthly parts between 1857 and 1861. This was a guide to running a Victorian household, with advice on fashion, child care, animal husbandry, poisons, the management of servants, science, religion, and industrialism. Of the 1,112 pages, over 900 contained recipes. Most were illustrated with coloured engravings. It is said that many of the recipes were plagiarised from earlier writers such as Acton, but the Beetons never claimed that the book's contents were original. It was intended as a reliable guide for the aspirant middle classes.\n\nThe American cook Fannie Farmer (1857–1915) published in 1896 her famous work \"The Boston Cooking School Cookbook\" which contained some 1,849 recipes.\n\nModern culinary recipes normally consist of several components\nEarlier recipes often included much less information, serving more as a reminder of ingredients and proportions for someone who already knew how to prepare the dish.\n\nRecipe writers sometimes also list variations of a traditional dish, to give different tastes of the same recipes.\n\nBy the mid 20th century, there were thousands of cookery and recipe books available. The next revolution came with the introduction of the TV cooks. The first TV cook in England was Fanny Cradock with a show on the BBC. TV cookery programs brought recipes to a new audience. In the early days, recipes were available by post from the BBC; later with the introduction of CEEFAX text on screen, they became available on television.\n\nThe first Internet Usenet newsgroup dedicated to cooking was \"net.cooks\" created in 1982, later becoming \"rec.food.cooking\". It served as a forum to share recipes text files and cooking techniques.\n\nIn the early 21st century, there has been a renewed focus on cooking at home due to the late-2000s recession. Television networks such as the Food Network and magazines are still a major source of recipe information, with international cooks and chefs such as Jamie Oliver, Gordon Ramsay, Nigella Lawson and Rachael Ray having prime-time shows and backing them up with Internet websites giving the details of all their recipes. These were joined by reality TV shows such as Top Chef or Iron Chef, and many Internet sites offering free recipes, but cookery books remain as popular as ever.\n\nMolecular gastronomy provides chefs with cooking techniques and ingredients, but this discipline also provides new theories and methods which aid recipe design. These methods are used by chefs, foodies, home cooks and even mixologists worldwide to improve or design recipes.\n\n\nRecipes Dapur Ocha Food Official Website\n"}

{"id": "673805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=673805", "title": "Shield laws in the United States", "text": "Shield laws in the United States\n\nA shield law is legislation designed to protect reporters' privilege. This privilege involves the right of news reporters to refuse to testify as to information and/or sources of information obtained during the news gathering and dissemination process. Currently the U.S. federal government has not enacted any national shield laws, but most of the 50 states do have shield laws or other protections for reporters in place.\n\nA shield law is law that gives reporters protection against being forced to disclose confidential information or sources in state court. There is no federal shield law and state shield laws vary in scope. In general, however, a shield law aims to provide the classic protection of, \"a reporter cannot be forced to reveal his or her source\" law. Thus, a shield law provides a privilege to a reporter pursuant to which the reporter cannot be forced by subpoena or other court order to testify about information contained in a news story and/or the source of that information. Several shield laws additionally provide protection for the reporter even if the source or information is revealed during the dissemination of the news story, that is whether or not the source or information is confidential. Shield laws do not ensure absolute protection. Depending on the jurisdiction, the privilege may be total or qualified, and it may also apply to other persons involved in the news-gathering and dissemination process as well, such as an editor or a publisher.\n\nThe issue of whether or not journalists can be subpoenaed and forced to reveal confidential information arose in 1972 with the United States Supreme Court case \"Branzburg v. Hayes\". Paul Branzburg was a reporter for \"The Courier-Journal\" in Louisville, Kentucky and wrote an article about the drug hashish. In creating the article, he came in contact with two local citizens who had created and used the drug. Because their activity was illegal, Branzburg promised the two individuals that he would not reveal their identities. After the article was published, Branzburg was subpoenaed by a local grand jury and ordered to reveal the identity of his sources. Branzburg refused and cited the provisions for freedom of the press from the First Amendment of the Constitution, in his defense.\n\nThe case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where the court decided in a five to four decision that the press did not have a Constitutional right of protection from revealing confidential information in court. The court acknowledged, however, that the government must \"convincingly show a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest.\" While this ruling did not set a precedent for journalistic rights in court, it did define a more stringent set of requirements for when a journalist could be subpoenaed in court.\n\nThis ruling was limited in nature, did not set a clear federal precedent regarding journalistic privileges from revealing confidential information, and thus has been interpreted and cited differently by courts over the years. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, for instance, has gleaned a qualified First Amendment privilege from the \"Branzburg\" decision. In \"Riley v. City of Chester\", the Court held that a reporter's right to protect his sources from disclosure could be overcome by a party who, by a preponderance of the evidence, demonstrated that he has made an effort to obtain the information elsewhere, that the only access to the information sought is through the journalist and his or her source, and that the information sought is crucial to the case. 612 F.2d 708 (3rd Cir. 1979).\n\nStates differ on their approach to protecting reporter's privilege. , 49 states and the District of Columbia offer some form of protections Forty states (plus D.C.) have passed shield laws. These laws vary from state to state. Some protections apply to civil but not to criminal proceedings. Other laws protect journalists from revealing confidential sources, but not other information. Many states have also established court precedents which provide protection to journalists, usually based on constitutional arguments. Only Wyoming lacks both legislation and judicial precedent to protect reporter's privilege.\n\nProponents of shield laws argue that they ensure that news gatherers may do their jobs to their fullest ability and that they help avoid a dichotomy between state laws and journalistic ethics, but the differences between states' laws has raised questions regarding which laws apply where in regard to national reporting. Proponents argue that a federal shield law should exist to eliminate contradictions between state laws.\n\nOpponents argue that shield laws afford extra privileges to journalists and that no citizen should be able to ignore a court ordered subpoena. Opponents also cite problems with defining who is considered a journalist or news gatherer and who is not, and note that if journalists get special protection from the government, then they are getting special journalistic benefits from the government instead of acting in complete independence. Some opponents also argue that journalists are often forced to testify by federal courts only in cases where a federal shield law likely would not protect them anyway. Finally, the federal government may not have constitutional right to enforce a shield law on state courts.\n\nMany journalists, however, are subpoenaed to testify in criminal and civil cases for coverage of a variety of matters that do not involve questions of national security. In recent years, there have been bills for federal shield laws in the United States Congress; however, none of these bills have passed the Senate. A primary objection to recent efforts to pass a federal shield law has been concern about leaks of classified information, particularly given the modern potential of such leaks to be published globally on the Internet by non-traditional recipients, such as WikiLeaks, who might claim to be \"journalists\" under an unqualified shield law.\n\nSometimes, the press is not even immune from its sources, such as when the source wishes to remain anonymous and the journalist wishes to disclose it. Such was the case in \"Cohen v. Cowles Media Co.\" (1991). The Supreme Court upheld that a source may have a right to confidentiality if an agreement was made with the reporter. Unfortunately, the bigger issue of source disclosure gets even more confusing, since the \"Cohen\" and \"Branzburg\" decisions could allow for the possibility of a journalist being subpoenaed by a court to disclose the name of a source, and being sued by a source under promissory estoppel laws for that disclosure. The current laws of the land, and the gray areas of forecasting potential consequences of publishing a story with confidential sources places the press in a very precarious situation. The current shield laws in some states give the press somewhat of an upper hand. However, since federal law does not recognize reportorial privilege in most cases, it is understandable how the press might feel muzzled.\n\nThe shield law privilege may also be waived by a reporter, as the New Jersey Supreme Court recently found in the case of \"In re Michael G. Venezia\". In that case, a New Jersey newspaper published an article containing defamatory statements about the plaintiff. The article attributed the statements to a source who was identified by name in the article; the source later denied making the defamatory statements. The plaintiff filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, the reporter and the alleged source of the defamatory statements. When the plaintiff sought to question the newspaper reporter about the article, the reporter and his newspaper refused, claiming protection under New Jersey's shield law. It was discovered, however, that the reporter had already given a statement under oath concerning the article—and, most important, the alleged source of the statement and exactly what that source said—to a local county prosecutor's office. The reporter also talked about his source and what the source said with a local municipal attorney. The \"Venezia\" court unanimously held that, while New Jersey has arguably the most protective shield law in the United States, a reporter waives the privilege when he talks about his sources and information outside of the newsgathering process, as did the reporter in \"Venezia.\" The \"Venezia\" court stated: \"The privilege holder is not permitted to step from behind the shield as he pleases, sallying forth one moment to make a disclosure to one person and then to seek the shield's protection from having to repeat the same disclosure to another person. A reporter cannot play peek-a-boo with the privilege.\" Thus, the \"Venezia\" court ordered that the reporter must submit to the plaintiff's deposition request. \"Venezia\" is highly significant because it marks the first time that a reporter has ever been found to have waived the privilege under New Jersey's current shield law, and because it explores the issue of what is or is not a \"newsgathering activity,\" and, thus, what activities are subject to protection under the law.\n\nCurrently, courts are struggling to define the standards for when shield laws should apply to non-traditional media outlets, particularly in the context of blogs and Internet publishing. In \"Obsidian Finance Group, LLC v. Cox\", the United States District Court for the District of Oregon found that to qualify as a reporter, a standard of professionalism must be met, including but not limited to being associated with a traditional news print or television media outlet or obtaining a journalism degree. A subsequent opinion in the same case clarified that these were examples and not requirements; bloggers could qualify, and the denial of media status in the Cox case appears to have been largely motivated by the defendant reportedly offering to remove accusations for a substantial fee. Conversely, in \"The Mortgage Specialists, Inc. v. Implode-Explode Heavy Industries, Inc.\" the New Hampshire Supreme Court adopted a much broader definition of media that applies to blogs and website curators, reiterating that \"freedom of the press is a fundamental personal right which is not confined to newspapers and periodicals.\"\n\nIn July 2013 the White House was pushing for a federal media shield law named the Free Flow of Information Act authored by U.S. Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham. Under the bill, the scope of protection for reporters would vary according to whether it was a civil case, an ordinary criminal case or a national security case. The greatest protection would be given to civil cases, in which litigants seeking to force reporters to testify or trying to obtain their calling information would be required to show why their need for the information outweighed the public's interest in unfettered news gathering. Ordinary criminal cases would work in a similar fashion, except the burden would be on the reporter seeking to quash the subpoena to show by a \"clear and convincing\" standard that the public interest in the free flow of information should prevail over the needs of law enforcement. Cases involving the disclosure of classified information would be more heavily tilted toward the government. Judges could not quash a subpoena through a balancing test if prosecutors presented facts showing that the information sought might help prevent a terrorist attack or other acts likely to harm national security. The legislation would create a presumption that when the government is seeking calling records from a telephone carrier, the news organization would be notified ahead of time, allowing it to fight the subpoena in court. But the bill would also allow the government to seek a 45- to 90-day delay in notification if a court determines that such notice would threaten the integrity of the investigation. The legislation would also include an exception where journalists could be subpoenaed if it means national security is at risk. \"Now, it's important to remember: virtually the only time the government subpoenas reporters, it involves leak investigations into stories by national security reporters. So it's hard to see how this bill will significantly help improve press freedom,\" wrote Trevor Timm, an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a board member of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. \"Worse, there's a strong argument that passing the bill [...] will weaken rights reporters already have and make it easier for the government to get sources from reporters.\"\n\nIn recent years, a larger effort by journalists to press for federal shield laws formed following the Plame affair/CIA leak scandal, in which reporters who released the name of Valerie Plame were asked who their sources were. One of the reporters, Judith Miller of \"The New York Times\", was jailed for 85 days in 2005 for refusing to disclose her source in the government probe.\n\nThere is a question about whether journalists should be exempt from national security laws, or not.\n\n\n"}

The film stars Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, and Emma Thompson. The main plot follows Harold Crick (Ferrell), an IRS worker who begins hearing a disembodied voice narrating his life as it happens – seemingly the text of a novel in which it is stated that he will soon die – and he frantically seeks to somehow prevent that ending. The film was shot on location in Chicago, and has been praised for its innovative, intelligent story and fine performances. Ferrell, who came to prominence playing brash comedic parts, garnered particular attention for offering a restrained performance in his first starring dramatic role.\n\nHarold Crick, an agent for the Internal Revenue Service, lives his life by his wristwatch. He is assigned to audit an intentionally tax-delinquent baker, Ana Pascal, to whom he is attracted. On the same day, he begins hearing the voice of a woman omnisciently narrating his life but is unable to communicate with it. Harold's watch stops working and he resets it using the time given by a bystander; the voice narrates, \"little did he know that this simple, seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death\". Worried by this prediction, Harold consults a psychiatrist who attributes the voice to schizophrenia, though they consider that if there really is a narrator, he should visit an expert in literature. Crick visits Jules Hilbert, a literature professor, and relates his story. When Jules recognizes aspects of a literary work in Harold's story, he encourages Harold to identify the author, first by determining if the work is a comedy or tragedy.\n\nAs Harold audits Ana, the two fall for each other, but when Harold refuses to accept cookies that Ana made for him because they could be viewed as a bribe, Ana tells him to leave, making Harold believe the story is a tragedy. On the advice of Jules, Harold spends the next day at home trying to control his destiny by doing nothing, but his apartment is partially demolished by a wrecking crew that mistook the building for an abandoned one. Jules believes that since Harold cannot control the plot, he should accept his impending death and enjoy whatever time he has left. Harold takes a vacation from work, develops his friendship with his co-worker Dave, fulfills his dream of learning to play the guitar, and dates Ana. Harold reassesses his story as a comedy. When he returns to Jules with this revelation, Harold inadvertently identifies the voice in his head from a television interview as author Karen Eiffel. Jules, an admirer of Karen's work, reveals that all of her books feature the main character's tragic death.\n\nKaren struggles from writer's block and researches ways to kill the character Harold to complete her next book. Her publisher sends an assistant, Penny Escher, to ensure the book is completed. Harold finds Karen through her tax records. When Karen learns that Harold experiences everything she writes, she is horrified by the thought that her books may have killed real people. She tells Harold she wrote a draft of his death, but has not typed it up yet; the events in the book manifest when she strikes the period key. Penny suggests Harold read the drafted ending to get his opinion. Harold cannot bring himself to read it and gives the manuscript to Jules to review. Jules confirms its excellence, labeling it as Karen's masterpiece; Harold's death is integral to its genius. Though Harold is distressed over his fate, Jules comforts him by stating the inevitability of death: this one death, at least, will have a deeper meaning. Harold reads the manuscript, then returns it to Karen, telling her the death she has written for him is \"beautiful\" and she should keep it intact. He spends one last night with Ana.\n\nThe next day, Harold prepares to return to work, despite Karen's voice narrating as she types up her ending. Because Harold's watch is three minutes fast owing to the imprecise time given to him days ago, he reaches the bus stop early and watches as a young boy falls in front of the oncoming bus. Karen continues writing; Harold leaps from the curb and pushes the child out of the way, but is struck by the bus. Karen cannot complete the sentence confirming Harold's death, and Harold wakes up in a hospital, injured but alive. He learns that fragments of his wristwatch blocked the right ulnar artery in his body after the collision, saving his life. When Jules reads Karen's final manuscript, he notes that the story is weaker without Harold's death. Karen admits the flaw, but points out that the story was meant to be about a man that dies unexpectedly; with Harold sacrificing himself, the story would have lost its tragic impact. In place of Harold, his wristwatch—anthropomorphized throughout the film—is the character who died tragically.\n\n\nIn 2001, writer Zach Helm was working with producer Clarence Helmus on a project they called \"The Disassociate\". Helm came to Doran with a new idea involving a man who finds himself accompanied by a narrator that only he can hear. Helm next decided that the narrator should state that the man is going to die since, as Helm described, \"There's something very poetic about the understanding of one's place in the universe, but it's far more dramatic when such understanding occurs only days before that life ends.\" Helm and Doran began referring to the new project as \"The Narrator Project\" and developed the story through a process of Helm bringing ideas and Doran asking questions. One of Helm's main ideas involved engaging the movie's form as much as its content.\n\nHelm named each of the film's chief characters after a famous scientist or scientifically influential artist, examples including Crick, Pascal, Eiffel, Escher, and Hilbert. When the character of Dr. Hilbert tells Harold that he has devised a series of 23 questions in order to investigate the narrator, it is a playful reference to Hilbert's 23 problems. The film's title derives from a quote by Mark Twain: \"Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.\"\n\nAccording to Helm, one of the film's major themes is of interconnectivity. As Helm stated, \"Each of these characters ends up doing little things to save one another. There's an underlying theme that the things we take most for granted are often the ones that make life worth living and actually keep us alive.\"\n\nThe film was shot on location in Chicago, Illinois. Dave's apartment, in which Harold takes residence after his own building is partially demolished, is part of the River City Condominiums. Hilbert's office was in a lecture hall at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The CNA Center at 333 South Wabash Avenue in the Loop served as the location for the IRS office.

Many downtown Chicago locations were used for scenes involving Karen Eiffel, Penny Escher, and Harold Crick. Columbia Pictures distributed the film.\n\nThe film was in part inspired by \"Playtime\" (1967), Jacques Tati's visionary comedy about modern urban life, and the cinematography and production design help create a claustrophobic sense of life in the city.\n\nThe music for this film includes original scores by the collaborative effort of Britt Daniel (singer/songwriter of Spoon) and Brian Reitzell (composer for \"Friday Night Lights\", \"The Bling Ring\" and \"Hannibal\"), as well as a mix of indie rock songs from various artists including Spoon. Reitzell is also the film's music supervisor.

Outside the US, it grossed another $13 million, for a worldwide total of $53.6 million.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 72% approval rating based on 172 reviews; the average rating is 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A fun, whimsical tale about an office drone trying to save his life from his narrator, \"Stranger Than Fiction\" features a subdued performance from Will Ferrell that contributes mightily to its quirky, mind-bending affect.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 67 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nRoger Ebert gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, stating that the film was thought-provoking and moral, and that \"Such an uncommonly intelligent film does not often get made...which requires us to enter the lives of these specific quiet, sweet, worthy people\", and he also praised Ferrell's performance saying, \"Will Ferrell stars, in another role showing that like Steve Martin and Robin Williams he has dramatic gifts to equal his comedic talent\". \n\n\"Rolling Stone\" rated the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating that though the premise of Ferrell's life being narrated is a set-up for farce, the film is \"less self-reflexively clever and more intimate\". Todd McCarthy in \"Variety\" positively reviewed the film, praising its invention and Ferrell's performance as nuanced: first playing a tight focused caricature of the company man, then exercising more humanity and wit without being \"goofy\".\n\nWill Ferrell\n\nZach Helm\n\nEmma Thompson\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal\n\n"}

The story revolves around six friends in a small town in the US who decide to make a full length amateur adult film.\n\nThe film was released under the title \"The Moguls\" in the United Kingdom on April 28, 2006. The film was released under the title \"The Amateurs\" and opened in limited release in the United States on December 7, 2007.\n\nSix friends come together to try to find fame and fortune by making the world’s most innocent adult movie ever made. Although they have literally no idea what they’re doing, they keep at it and are determined to accomplish their goal...no matter what gets in the way. \n\nAfter the clueless crew finally completes the film, they screen it for the first time at the local bar. The brother of a girl whose scene ultimately was not used (besides some brief shots of her face) barges in, takes the reel off the projector, covers it in whiskey and sets it aflame. \n\nIt is revealed that this was the only print they had and that all their work has been lost. However, the cinematographer had been videotaping the entire production process on mini DV tapes. He then edits these down into a completely innocent documentary, minus the nudity and sex scenes, about the trials and tribulations of making (and then losing) their original film. This new version is released as the titular \"The Amateurs\" which becomes a critical and financial success on the independent film circuit.\n\n"}

She is assigned to a wireless listening station, transcribing Enigma coded morse transmissions from Nazi Germany and makes friends with Mary. After an altercation in a pub she is moved to Bletchley Park, the centre of the code-breaking operation, only to find herself cleaning and making tea. She overhears the male staff discussing the eponymous 'Imitation Game', devised by Bletchley Park's Alan Turing. Cathy is befriended by Cambridge mathematics don Turner (based loosely on Turing) and they end up in bed together but for Turner it is a failure and he accuses her of planning it all to humiliate him. Later Cathy is caught in Turner's room reading documents relating to the Ultra programme, and she is incarcerated in military prison for the remainder of the war.\n\n\nWriting in 1980, Ian McEwan stated: \"Initially I wanted to write a play about Alan Turing, one of the founding fathers of modern computers', but his researches provided very little material, 'by this time other facts about Bletchley Park interested me more. By the end of the war ten thousand people were working in and around Bletchley. The great majority of them were women doing vital but repetitive jobs...The ‘need to know’ rule meant that the women knew as much as was necessary to do their jobs, which was very little. As far as I could discover, there were virtually no women in at the centre of the Ultra secret. There was a widely held view at the beginning of the war that women could not keep secrets. I had come to think of Ultra as a microcosm, not only of the war but of a whole society...By having a woman at the centre of the film (I no longer thought of it as a play), I could disguise my own ignorance about Ultra as hers. The idea was to have her move from the outermost ring to the very centre, where she would be destroyed.\"\n\n\nThe Imitation Game will be available on DVD 1st October 2018.\n"}

Wallace attempted to outsail them but, outgunned as he was, soon felt he had little option but to allow the French to board his ship. She was then allowed by Spain (then friendly with France though not yet — in formal terms at least — at war with Britain) to continue to Málaga.\nAt Málaga her artistic contents were passed on from the French government to two trading companies with links to Ireland, despite Wallace's protests that the ship was full of \"extremely precious goods\" (the French had already seized her cash cargo), and the Spanish king was informed by his prime minister, the Count of Floridablanca, of the arrival of the art works. Upon Spain's formal declaration of war, king Charles III secretly bought the art from a syndicate of Madrid merchants for 360,000 silver reales (a discount on their original asking price of 600,000 gold doubloons, but still a considerable sum) and had it brought by cart to the capital. The portraits of Basset and Lord Lewisham, meanwhile, were acquired by the Spanish Prime Minister.\n\nAlthough the British consul at Cadiz had initially informed the British Admiralty that the \"Westmorland\" and her cargo had been seized as legitimate prizes, demands followed from the British ambassador, firmly backed at cabinet level, for the repatriation of the art and (in a prisoner exchange for French and Spanish prisoners taken by the Royal Navy) the crew of the \"Westmorland\". Yet to this day, all these coveted artistic treasures remain the possession of the Prado Museum, the Real Academia, and other Spanish national collections. There were only a few, very limited exceptions: a package of Catholic relics intended for the Duke of Norfolk (which the Spanish returned unopened to the Vatican); and Sir Watkin Williams Wynn's \"Perseus and Andromeda\" by Mengs, which ended up in the collection of Catherine the Great at the Hermitage Museum.\n\nIn 1784, the £100,000 for which the art had been insured at Livorno were paid out in London. The \"Westmorland\", for its part, was renamed, re-commissioned into the Spanish fleet, but eventually re-taken in the Caribbean by the British.\n\nIn 2012 an exhibition of many of the art works captured was held at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University and then traveled to the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, United States.\n\n"}
