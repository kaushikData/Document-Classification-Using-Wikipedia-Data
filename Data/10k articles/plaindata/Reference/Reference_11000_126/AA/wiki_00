Haggin, was an American music critic.\n\nA lifelong resident of New York City, he graduated from the Juilliard School in 1920 as a piano major. He published his first article in 1923, and his career as a journalist commenced shortly thereafter as a contributor to \"The New Republic.\"\n\nHe was music critic of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle from 1934 to 1937, and from 1936 to 1957 was music critic of \"The Nation\". From 1946 to 1949, he wrote a column for music on the radio for The New York Herald Tribune.\n\nHaggin was a staunch but not entirely uncritical admirer of the conductor Arturo Toscanini. Their personal friendship lasted from the late 1930s, shortly after Toscanini started conducting the NBC Symphony, which the network had enlarged from its house orchestra for him, on Christmas night 1937, to 1950, four years before Toscanini's retirement. He was the first major American critic to recognize choreographer George Balanchine. Also in the 1930s, he launched the career of the future record producer John Hammond, hiring him as a reviewer for the \"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\".\n\nHaggin wrote twelve books on music and two on ballet. He was the author of the first general guide to recorded classical music, \"Music on Records\" (1938), later expanded as \"The Listener's Musical Companion\" (1956), which Haggin regularly updated in new editions until 1978. His best-known books are about Toscanini: \"Conversations with Toscanini\" (1959), a personal reminiscence and the closest thing to a series of interviews with the publicity-shy Toscanini that has ever been published, and \"The Toscanini Musicians Knew\" (1967), a series of interviews with musicians who played or sang under the venerable Italian maestro. The two volumes were republished in 1989 as \"Arturo Toscanini, Contemporary Recollections of the Maestro\". \n\nHaggin was one of the few critics who became personally close to Toscanini, who gave him access to private documents and other utterances that he had never permitted to any other author. The Haggin books were designed to serve as a corrective to factual errors, and to what Haggin regarded as misinformed opinions, which had already begun to circulate in the American media.\n\nAs a critic, Haggin showed little patience for mediocre music, musicians or fellow critics. He criticized RCA Victor for issuing badly engineered or mastered recordings of Toscanini and \"enhancing\" them with echo-chamber effects, treble-peaking and/or pseudo-stereo sound. (Partly because of Haggin's complaints, later editions of those recordings did without such interventions.) In addition, Haggin was strongly critical of the interpretive style of Romantically inclined conductors who often deviated from the printed score like Wilhelm Furtwängler, who at the time was considered Toscanini's polar opposite and greatest rival. Nor was he loath to make value judgments about some later Romantic (like Brahms, Wagner and Richard Strauss) and many leading twentieth-century composers and works; such outspokenness offended some of his readers, and endeared him to others. Even Toscanini's own repertoire choices were by no means always safe from Haggin's censure. For instance, when Toscanini gave the American premiere of Shostakovich's \"Leningrad\" Symphony in 1942 (he described this symphony as epitomizing the \"suffering of the Russian people\" at the hands of the German invaders), Haggin dissented, declaring the piece to be \"an inflated monstrosity of straining, portentous banality.\" Also Haggin made some of his most passionate pronouncements from the standpoint of \"meta-criticism,\" sometimes spending more column inches in criticizing his fellow critics' opinions than in expressing his own sentiments on the music or performers in question.\n\nIn his later years, he wrote various long essays for \"The Hudson Review, The New Republic, Musical America\", \"Encounter\", and \"The Yale Review\".\n\nBooks listed in chronological order.\n\n\n"}

At age 16, while working as a lifeguard in Wildwood, New Jersey, he was playfighting with co-workers when a wrestling promoter spotted him and asked him to help with his roster, as many current ones were seeing action in World War II.\n\nHis first match with later rival Buddy Rogers was in February 1944, tagging with him in Philadelphia and Baltimore-Washington. Darnell would himself leave wrestling for World War II service in December 1944, joining the United States Army. Post-war Darnell returned to wrestling in Texas, once more with Rogers, who had previously wrestled under his real name Herman Rohde. At the time he was becoming \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers, and Darnell was booked as his brother Billy Rogers. This was largely in part to promoter and Rogers' booker Jack Pfefer, though Darnell himself has stated he wasn't sure if the idea for the brother gimmick was Rogers' or Pfefer's.\n\nDarnell and Rogers next went to California, with wrestling reaching new popularity thanks to television exposure. For the showmanship of it Rogers donned sequined capes, whereas Darnell first donned the leopard-skin outfit, for which he would become famous. Their careers would become forever intertwined when they began facing each other with Rogers as the heel champion and Darnell becoming a heavy fan favorite. Promoters nationwide wanted the Rogers-Darnell match, with more than 200 matches occurring between them. Despite their history Rogers still crushed discs in Darnell's neck with a botched piledriver, though he himself accidentally knocked out some of Rogers' teeth. Les Thatcher has even stated that Darnell's matches with Rogers inspired him to enter the wrestling business.\n\nDarnell was also known for a well recognized team with Bill Melby, winning the Chicago version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with him in 1953. In 1954, he worked with Sam Muchnick in St. Louis and also booked for an Indiana promotion. In a televised match on 20 May 1961, Darnell beat Ali Pasha (Alexander Vieira Fontes) who died of a heart attack after being slammed down.\n\nHe used his World War II G.I. Bill to attend aviation school and become a pilot, flying himself to his matches. He also ran a nightclub until 1985. Though Darnell retired in 1961, he would wrestle sparsely into the next year, then went to a chiropractic school in Glendale, California, finishing in Indiana. He would begin practicing in his home of New Jersey and moved to Florida for a period, getting back in touch with Rogers, before returning to New Jersey. Darnell regularly attended Cauliflower Alley Club reunions and received the Senator Hugh Farley Award from the Amsterdam, New York-based Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. Darnell died on September 7, 2007 at his home in Maple Shade Township, New Jersey.\n\n\n"}

Compiègne was one of three seats of royal government, the others being Versailles and Fontainebleau. It is located in Compiègne in the Oise department and is open to the public.\n\nEven before the chateau was constructed, Compiègne was the preferred summer residence for French monarchs, primarily for hunting given its proximity to Compiègne Forest. The first royal residence was built in 1374 for Charles V, and a long procession of successors both visited it and modified it. Louis XIV resided in Compiègne some 75 times. Louis XV was perhaps even more favorably impressed; the Comte de Chevergny described his infatuation: \"Hunting was his main passion... and Compiègne, with its immense forest, with its endless avenues amongst the trees, with its stretches down which you could ride all day and never come to the end, was the ideal place to indulge that passion.\"\n\nIn 1750, prominent architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel proposed a thorough renovation of the chateau. Work began in 1751 and was finished in 1788 by Gabriel's student Le Dreux de La Châtre. The ancient town ramparts dictated the château's triangular plan; the resultant building covers about . It is Neoclassical in style, with simplicity and clarity governing both its external and interior features.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the château passed into the jurisdiction of the Minister for the Interior. In 1795 all furniture was sold and its works of art were sent to the Muséum Central; it was essentially gutted. \nNapoleon visited in 1799 and again in 1803. In 1804 the château became an imperial domain and in 1807 he ordered it be made habitable again. Architects Berthault, Percier and Fontaine, decorators Dubois and Redouté, and cabinetmakers Jacob-Desmalter and Marcion restored the château. Its layout was altered, a ballroom added, and the garden was replanted and linked directly to the forest.\n\nThe result is an example of First French Empire style (1808-1810), though some traces of the earlier décor survive. The writer Auguste Luchet remarked that \"Compiègne speaks of Napoleon as Versailles does of Louis XIV\". From 1856 on, Napoleon III and Eugénie made it their autumn residence, and redecorated some rooms in the Second Empire style.\n\nToday's visitors can find three distinct museums within the chateau: the apartments themselves; the Museum of the Second Empire; and the National Car Museum (Le Musée de la Voiture), founded in 1927, with a collection of carriages, bicycles, and automobiles.\n\n"}

The English edition, translated by story consultant Alexis Niki, was published in May 2017 by Le Clown & l’Enfant.\n\nUpon the re-publication of the French version of \"Writing Drama\" in 2011, Yves Lavandier decided to extract the book’s most useful chapters and to create two stand-alone books: \"Construire un récit\" and \"Evaluer un scénario\" (\"Analyzing a Script\"). \"Construire un récit\" grew from 50 pages in the French version of \"Writing Drama\" to 170, and then to 220 for the 2016 edition.\n\n\"Constructing a Story\" is a practical handbook on how to write a narrative. Yves Lavandier’s ambition is to help authors who want to tell a story convey their thoughts and their universe in an accessible way. For this he proposes a method that starts from the meaning the author wants to communicate to arrive at the complete narrative via the steps of the pitch, the foundations, the milestones, the step outline, and the treatment. The general principle of Lavandier’s approach is: \"\"You don’t build a house starting with the wallpaper.\"\n\nAs in \"Writing Drama\", the author puts forth a vision of the \"three-act structure\" that differs to that of many Anglo-Saxon theorists and that he considers \"simple, logical, and more importantly, natural: before the action, during the action, after the action.\"\"\n\nIn addition to several passages covering the work of characterization, a large chapter is dedicated entirely to the character arc, the potential for psychological transformation for one of the characters. The author proposes tools to justify such a transformation and analyzes some twenty works from the specific angle of the character arc. Among these are: \"The Apartment\", \"Casablanca\", \"A Christmas Carol\", \"Groundhog Day\", \"The Lives of Others\", \"Oedipus Rex\", \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest\", \"One Thousand and One Nights\", \"Schindler’s List\", \"The Taming of the Shrew\", and \"Toy Story\". In his analysis of the beginning of \"Tootsie\", for example, Yves Lavandier points out that contrary to many other analyses, the protagonist (Dustin Hoffman) is not actually characterized as a chauvinist who needs to learn to respect women.\n\nThe cover photo represents romanesco broccoli, a natural example of fractal structure. Yves Lavandier considers the objective-obstacle pairing to be the basic pattern of story, and to follow the fractal principle. In Lavandier’s view, narrative is the combination, at different scales, of thousands of objective-obstacle pairings and of their resulting mechanisms: the protagonist, the inciting incident, the three-act structure, the climax, etc. The author uses \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" to illustrate his point.\n\nIn the magazine L’Avant-Scène Cinéma issue 609 (January 2014), Jean-Philippe Guérand writes : \"\"Constructing a Story is a veritable guide of writing know-how in which the author prods his reader and pushes the emerging screenwriter to give his best with sections such as \"Be ferocious to your protagonist\" or \"Make the audience participate,\" and is applicable to both cinema and television.\"\n\nScreenwriter and game designer Antoine Bauza states: \"\"While it can’t replace the reading of the sacrosanct tome \"Writing Drama\", Constructing a Story is a gold mine in its own right (and an excellent complement) for writers. It gave me precious advice as well as a solid dose of motivation.\"\n\nFor film agent Julian Friedmann, \"Constructing a Story\" manages to get underneath the skin of the story.\n\n\"The chapter on creating story and character arcs is unique\", writes screenwriter and novelist Ann Kimbrough, \"I’ve never seen anyone break down arcs in this manner. I found it very useful as a writer of any medium. It’s a MUST READ part of the book.\"\n\nFor screenwriter, teacher and script consultant Elana Golden, \"Constructing a Story is also a meditation on the creative process in general and cinema in particular, with examples from European and American films and from psychology, philosophy, classic theater and archetypal stories.\"\"\n\n"}

These have provided many insights about the nineteenth century, from scientific exploration and travel to religious debate and discussion. The letters also illuminate many aspects of Darwin's work: the development of his scientific ideas; his opinions on issues he did not publish about (his letters to Asa Gray, for example, show his changing opinions on the American Civil War); matters about his character and health; the ways in which he relied upon correspondence for much of his investigations into natural history; and the ways in which he marshalled scientific support for his ideas amongst friends and colleagues. The historian of science Janet Browne has argued in her biography of Darwin that his ability to correspond daily played a crucial role in the development of his theory and his ability to garner support for it from colleagues.\n\nCorrespondence was central to Darwin's research. In his early years, most of the letters he filed away immediately were those relevant to one of his ongoing scientific projects. Other letters were stuck onto \"spits\", as he called them, and when his slender stock of these was exhausted, he would burn the letters of several years, in order that he might make use of the liberated \"spits.\" This process, carried on for years, destroyed many of the letters received before 1862. Even so, the number of letters is remarkable, even in these early years. After publication of the Origin of Species, Darwin's children convinced him to save a far greater proportion of his correspondence, so that the sequence from the early 1860s onwards is remarkably full. \n\nIn 1887, five years after Darwin's death, Darwin's son Francis Darwin published \"The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin\" in three volumes, to accompany the publication of \"The Autobiography of Charles Darwin\". This was later followed by two volumes of \"More Letters of Charles Darwin\" published in 1902.\n\nIn 1974 the Darwin Correspondence Project was founded at Cambridge University by Frederick Burkhardt, with the aid of Sydney Smith. Cambridge University owns 9,000 letters and has obtained copies of another 6,000 held in private collections. New letters are being discovered at around 60 per year and photocopies of new finds should be sent to the project, which will eventually publish them. Volumes of the correspondence appear at regular intervals from Cambridge University Press, with the content freely available online after four years. The Darwin Correspondence website also includes extensive additional materials, including resources for using the letters in school and university teaching.\n\nEntries marked with asterisks denote persons for which 100 letters or more have been located. All of these letters can be found on the Darwin Correspondence Project website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelections of letters published by the Correspondence Project include:\n\n\n"}

She plans to open an act in Las Vegas, but needs $50,000 for the project. Upon learning she is a beneficiary of her deceased great-aunt Morgana, she travels to Fallwell, Massachusetts, to claim the inheritance, which includes a mansion, a recipe book and Morgana's pet poodle, Algonquin.\n\nIn Fallwell, Elvira's worldly attitude and revealing clothes set the conservative town council against her. But theater operator Bob Redding befriends her. The town's teenagers quickly accept her, to the chagrin of their parents, who consider her a bad influence. Bowling alley owner Patty is interested in Bob, and at her late-night gory film festival she was presenting at Bob's theater she succeeds in humiliating Elvira. Elvira struggles to sell the house, so she can depart for Las Vegas. Meanwhile, she is unaware that her harsh but seemingly-harmless uncle Vincent is actually a warlock who is obsessed with obtaining Morgana's spellbook; he plans to kill Elvira and conquer the world, and has been fuelling the townspeople's hostility.\n\nElvira tries to impress Bob with a home-cooked dinner, but mistakenly uses the spellbook as a cookbook and summons a creature that attacks them.

Elvira is tied to a stake and the fire is lit, but she uses Morgana's ring to summon rain that quenches the fire; she escapes with Bob. At the mansion, Elvira and Vincent engage in a magical battle that sets fire to the house. Elvira banishes Vincent to the underworld, while the house and all of the magical artifacts are destroyed.\n\nThe next day, Elvira prepares to leave town. The townspeople apologize for their behavior, and everyone asks Elvira to stay. She kisses Bob but, as she is homeless, she insists that she must leave.

One of the first all-welded ships built in Australia, she was constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard between 1952 and 1959, and was commissioned into the RAN a day after completion.\n\n\"Vampire\" was regularly deployed to South East Asia during her career: she was attached to the Far East Strategic Reserve on five occasions, including during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and escorted the troop transport on six of the latter's twenty-five transport voyages to Vietnam. In 1977, the destroyer was assigned to escort the Royal Yacht \"Britannia\" during Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip's visit to Australia. In 1980, \"Vampire\" was reclassified as a training ship.\n\nThe warship remained in service until 1986, when she was decommissioned and presented to the Australian National Maritime Museum for preservation as a museum ship; the largest museum-owned object on display in Australia.\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy initially ordered four \"Daring\" class destroyers, which were to be named after the ships of the \"Scrap Iron Flotilla\" of World War II. The ships were modified during construction: most changes were made to improve habitability, including the installation of air-conditioning. \"Vampire\" and her sister ships were the first all-welded ships to be constructed in Australia.\n\nThe \"Daring\"s had a standard displacement of 2,800 tons, which increased to 3,600 tons at full load. \"Vendetta\" and her sisters were long, with a beam of , and a draught of at mean, and at full or deep load. Her propulsion system consisted of two Foster Wheeler boilers, feeding two English Electric geared turbines, which provided to two propeller shafts. \"Vampire\" could sail at over , and had a range of at . Her standard ship's company consisted of 20 officers and 300 sailors.\n\n\"Vampire\"s main armament consisted of six Mark V guns mounted in three Mark 6 twin turrets, two forward and one aft. Her anti-aircraft outfit consisted of six 40 mm Bofors; two single mountings on the forward superstructure, and two twin mountings on the aft superstructure. Four Browning machine guns were carried for point defence. Five 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted to a single Mark IV pentad mount on the deck between the forward and aft superstructures. For anti-submarine warfare, a Limbo anti-submarine mortar was carried on the aft deck, offset to port. The twin Bofors, torpedo launcher, and Limbo mortar were all removed during various refits. A Sea Cat missile system was installed at some point during her career.\n\"Vampire\" was fitted with a Type 170 attack sonar, a Type 174 search sonar, and a Type 185 submarine detection sonar. The original fire control directors were a Flyplane 3 and an MRS 8. These were replaced during the 1970–71 refit with two M22 units. The air warning radar was replaced with an LW-02 air search radar during the same refit, and an 8gr-301A surface search and navigation radar was installed.\n\n\"Vampire\" was laid down at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, New South Wales on 1 July 1952. The destroyer was launched on 27 October 1956 by the wife of the Governor-General, Sir William Slim. She was completed on 22 June 1959, and commissioned into the RAN in Sydney a day later. Between laying down and completion, the ship's cost increased from A£2.6 million to A£7 million.\n\nAfter competing work-up trials and entering active service, \"Vampire\" underwent training exercises with ships of the RAN and Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) until early 1960. \"Vampire\" was deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve in March 1960, and sailed to Singapore after a brief visit to New Zealand. She returned to Sydney in December, and was docked for refit until April 1961. The destroyer was awarded the Gloucester Cup for 1960, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN. Following the refit, \"Vampire\" operated in Australian waters, including participation in the training exercise Tuckerbox in August, then returned to the Far East in September. On 1 December 1961, a chief petty officer died aboard from illness. The destroyer was in Hong Kong for Christmas, then in January 1962, visited Nha Trang and Saigon in Vietnam with . \"Vampire\" received the Gloucester Cup again for 1961. the first months of 1962, the ship participated in training exercises in the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal, before returning to Australia on 7 April. \"Vampire\" participated in Exercise Tuckerbox II during August and September, and was present at Fremantle, Western Australia during November for the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth.\nOn 31 January 1963, \"Vampire\" departed for her third FESR deployment, which lasted until late July. During this, the destroyer participated in South East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) Exercise Sea Serpent. After returning to Sydney, \"Vampire\" was taken in hand by Garden Island Dockyard for refit, which concluded in February 1964. During the docking, the ship was awarded the Gloucester Cup for 1963; the third time the award was granted to the ship. After post-refit trials, \"Vampire\" sailed for her fourth Far East deployment in June, and was involved in Exercise Litgas shortly after reaching the region. From October until January 1965, the ship was involved in the Commonwealth response to the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation; carrying out patrols around the Malay Peninsula to interdict vessels smuggling troops into Malaysia. The destroyer remained in South East Asia until January 1965, and returned to Sydney on 12 February.\n\nAfter a short period of leave and self-maintenance, \"Vampire\" sailed again for the Far East in April, exercising with the French frigate \"Doudart de Lagree\" en route from Manus Island to Manila. \"Vampire\" escorted the aircraft carrier during SEATO Exercise Seahorse. During early June, \"Vampire\" accompanied the troop transport for parts of the latter's first transport voyage to Vietnam. The ship's fifth Far East deployment was concluded when she reached Sydney on 22 June. On 20 December, the ashes of Vice Admiral Sir Hastings Harrington were scattered from \"Vampire\" off the coast of Sydney.\n\n\"Vampire\" was sent on her sixth Far East deployment in March 1966. In late April, \"Vampire\" was temporarily withdrawn from Strategic Reserve service to escort \"Sydney\" on her third Vietnam voyage: the destroyer returned to Hong Kong on 9 May. During late May and early June, \"Vampire\" participated in SEATO Exercise Sea Imp. On 10 June 1966, \"Vampire\" collided with the Danish merchant ship \"Emilie Maersk\" on the Chao Phraya River; the destroyer received only minor damage, and was repaired in Singapore. From July to August, the destroyer was assigned to Tawau to protect the region from Indonesian aggression during the Confrontation. This primarily consisted of using her radar to detect approaching vessels and coordinate interception efforts, although \"Vampire\" was called on to provide fire support for Commonwealth land forces on two occasions. The ship returned to Sydney on 13 August.\n\nOn 4 January 1967, \"Vampire\" sailed for her seventh FESR tour. The destroyer provided assistance to the grounded freighter \"Mata Thevi\" in February, and from April until May, accompanied \"Sydney\" on the latter's fifth and sixth troop transport voyages. During the voyage back to Australia in late August and early September, \"Vampire\" made port visits in Indonesia; the first RAN ship to do so after the Confrontation's end. On arrival in Sydney, the destroyer was docked for a six-month refit. In July 1968, \"Vampire\" and other vessels of the RAN were involved in training exercises with the Royal New Zealand Navy. The destroyer visited Indonesia again in September, then served as review ship during a ceremonial fleet entry into Sydney Harbour: for this role, several weapons, including one of the three 4.5-inch turrets, were temporarily removed.\n\nOn 23 March 1969, \"Vampire\" returned to the Far East. On 14 May 1969, the destroyer met \"Sydney\" off Singapore, and escorted the troopship to Vũng Tàu on the former aircraft carrier's fourteenth Vietnam voyage. The destroyer returned to Australian waters in October. On 16 April 1970, \"Vampire\" joined a fleet of 45 naval ships from 13 nations to perform a ceremonial entry into Sydney Harbour as part of the first Australian Bicentenary, celebrating the discovery and claiming of the east coast of Australia by James Cook.\n\nIn June 1970, \"Vampire\" was handed over to Williamstown Naval Dockyard for a $US10 million modernisation. The modernisation consisted of over 2,000 upgrades and modifications. The sensor suite, including fire control systems, air radar, and surface radar, was updated. The destroyer's armament was refurbished, with the main gun turrets rebuilt and the Bofors reconditioned, although the torpedo pentad mount was removed. The superstructure was rebuilt, with the primary aim to enclose the open bridge area, along with modernisation of the ship's galleys and installation of more air conditioning. Redesigned masts and funnel cowlings were fitted. \"Vampire\" reentered active service on 4 March 1972.\n\nIn October 1972, \"Vampire\" was deployed to Singapore for four months as part of the ANZUK force: the first \"Daring\" class destroyer assigned to the force. She was temporarily withdrawn in November to accompany \"Sydney\" on her twenty-fifth and final voyage to Vũng Tàu. \"Vampire\" returned to Sydney on 1 March 1973. In April, the destroyer sailed to Apia, Samoa for the South Pacific Forum. In September, the destroyer was part of a multinational training exercise off New Zealand, then returned to Sydney and was present for the opening of the Sydney Opera House on 20 October.\n\n\"Vampire\" began 1974 by participating in a joint Australia-Indonesia military exercise, before sailing to the Coral Sea in June to participate in Exercise Kangaroo I. In September 1974, the ship entered Garden Island Dockyard for an eight-month refit.\n\nOn 22 August 1975, \"Vampire\", sister ship , and the supply ship were prepositioned in Darwin following tensions between Indonesia and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor (which cumulated in the Indonesian invasion in December). The ships were to evacuate Australian citizens and Timorese refugees if needed, but this did not eventuate. On 21 September, the destroyer left Darwin for a five-month Strategic Reserve deployment. During her fifth deployment, which ended with her return to Sydney on 18 February 1976, \"Vampire\" joined training exercises with United States Navy ships in the China Sea, and visited sixteen ports in six countries for diplomatic and goodwill purposes. On 31 May 1976, \"Vampire\" and the destroyer escort departed Sydney Harbour for the United States. The two ships, along with the destroyer , visited ports along the west coast of the United States as the RAN representatives during the United States Bicentennial: \"Vampire\" visited Long Beach, California and Seattle, Washington. \"Vampire\" returned to Sydney on 6 August, but departed seven days later to participate in exercises in South East Asia.\n\nDuring the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip to Australia in March 1977, \"Vampire\" was assigned as the escort to Her Majesty's Yacht \"Britannia\". \"Vampire\" met \"Britannia\" on 11 March, and accompanied the royal yacht to Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Fremantle. Between April and July 1977, \"Vampire\" was involved in two rescue missions and three fleet training exercises. On 5 September, \"Vampire\" left Sydney as \"part of the RAN contribution to Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee.\" The destroyer returned on 18 October. At the end of 1977, \"Vampire\" participated in Exercise Compass 77, held off Sri Lanka. The destroyer was primarily involved in training exercises during 1978 and 1979.\n\nIn April 1979, it was announced that \"Vampire\" would be converted into a training ship. This refit was carried out from 21 January to 18 April 1980, and included the removal of the destroyer's M22 fire control radars, LW-02 air search radar, Limbo anti-submarine mortar, and twin Bofors mounts, and the installation of a training classroom where the Limbo previously resided. Following the conversion, \"Vampire\" was assigned to the RAN training squadron, where she joined . On 13 May, \"Vampire\" and \"Jervis Bay\" were ordered to the Solomon Islands to observe the splashdown of China's first intercontinental ballistic missile test-firing. The ICBM landed north-west of Fiji, and was observed by both the two Australian ships and a fleet of 18 warships from the People's Liberation Army Navy. On 6 November 1980, the two ships joined the patrol boats and to perform a ceremonial entry into Darwin as part of the city's Navy Week.\n\nOn 25 June 1986, \"Vampire\" left active service. She was decommissioned on 13 August 1986, having spent 27 years in service, and travelled . She was later presented to the Australian National Maritime Museum for preservation as a museum ship: on loan from 1990 to 1997, then transferred outright in 1997. \"Vampire\" is the largest museum piece on display in Australia. The ship is also used for training RAN divers in hull clearance. In 1994, two disabled twin Bofors mounts were returned to the destroyer, replacing those removed in 1980. On 9 April 1997, permission was granted for \"Vampire\" to fly the Australian White Ensign, despite not being a commissioned warship.\n\nThe destroyer is towed to every five years for maintenance and cleaning. During a docking in October 2006, rumours spread among RAN personnel that \"Vampire\" would be refitted and returned to active service. During the same refit, a fire broke out in the ship's boiler room. Nobody was injured, and no irreparable damage was caused.\n\nAn overhaul of the RAN battle honours system completed in March 2009 saw \"Vampire\" retroactively honoured for her service in the Strategic Reserve between 1964 and 1966—the time of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. Any future ships named HMAS \"Vampire\" will carry the battle honour \"Malaysia 1964–66\" in addition to the honours earned by the previous HMAS \"Vampire\".\n\nIn November 2015, the warship was moved to the new Warships Pavilion 'Action Stations' at the Australian National Maritime Museum alongside HMAS Onslow and HMAS Advance.\n\n\n\n"}

These creatures would obtain their power by living for 100 years and not biting any living beings. Some of these who are offsprings of a pair from their birth have such power. The first such creature was a female who was by birth a Naagin. She was created by Lord Shiv. In some folklore this story prevails. They prefer to be in the form of a human being most of the time.\n\nIchchadhari Naag, in snake form, possess a gem called \"Naag Mani\", considered much more valuable than a diamond. Legends tell of many people losing their lives through snake bites, when the snakes took revenge for stolen Mani, or if either of a pair of snakes was killed. According to legend, the snakes can be controlled using Been, the musical instrument used by snake charmers. These types of snakes are said to be vengeful and will take revenge on anyone who disturbs them.They are also great devotees of Lord Shiv. Its said that the first of these creatures was created by Lord Shiv while he came out of the pillar when Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma were fighting on who is superior to whom. \n\nThe legends of Ichchhadhari Naag have been used as a plot basis for many comic plot and stories.

The concept of an electrostatic generator was new, and the battery (array) of leiden jars was the largest ever built (only one of the 4 sets of leiden jars is on display to conserve space). The two glass disks of the generator are 1.65 meters in diameter, and the machine is capable of generating a potential of 330,000 volts.\n\nThe device is a larger version of a similar model built in Groningen by Gerhard Kuyper in 1774 for physics student Martin van Marum, who used it to make a name for himself in the study of electricity with his lectures and demonstrations.\n\nIt was Van Marum's dream to create a larger version, and he applied to the Teylers Stichting in 1783 for funding to create such a large instrument in the hope that it would add a valuable contribution to the science of electricity. On April 11 of that year his request was granted, and on May 7 Cuthbertson was employed who finished the device a year later and it was proudly installed on Christmas Eve. The machine performed above expectations and was only modified a few times to prevent leaks of the static charge. The study of electricity leakage led to many insights in the study of electricity. The machine was last modified in 1791. For the friction, cushions were used as an improvement over the mercury bath used in the earlier model. For a complete description of the electrostatic generator, an explanation was produced in 1868 by the Parisian author Adolphe Ganot (1804-1887).\n\nVan Marum himself became curator of the physics cabinet at Teylers in the same year the instrument was ordered to be made.

According to the legend, in 1887 four brothers in Dryden, Texas—Frank, Jim, John, and Lee Reagan—hired an illiterate Seminole man named William Kelly to help with work on their ranch. Kelly was known as \"Nigger Bill\" (\"nigger\" being a term for a multiracial person in the slang of the Big Bend region) and has been identified as a cook and also as a horse wrangler; at the time of his employment by the Reagans, he was only 14. While working on the ranch, Kelly announced that he had discovered a gold mine, and was \"greeted only with jeers\". The next day he again tried to tell the Reagans about the mine, even going so far as to show them a lump of gold ore, but received a \"cussing out\" for his trouble.\n\nAfter this rejection, Kelly went to San Antonio, where he knew a white assayer, and asked him to analyze the ore. Stories then conflict: One account states that he returned to Dryden, where the Reagans received a letter addressed to him that confirmed the gold was immensely valuable, and then killed him and dumped his body in the Rio Grande. The other states that, shortly after returning, he \"borrowed\" a horse and fled. Whatever the case, the Reagans dedicated their lives to attempting to find the mine; one report from 1930 claims that the three Reagans alive at that point had still not given up on their search. As well as the Reagans, many other expeditions set out in search of the mine; the legend has it that, while some explorers did discover it, they always died before they could make a profit or pass on the information.\n\nOne of the more serious searches was instigated by William Broderick Cloete, a British mine owner who believed in the story so completely that he offered Lock Campbell, a Texan man, expenses of $10,000 if he would undertake an expedition to find it. On July 19, 1899, Campbell and four other men signed an agreement to search for it, and one of the men later claimed to have discovered it in the Ladrones Mountains in New Mexico, but this was never verified. In 1909, an Oklahoman named Wattenberg traveled to Alpine, Texas, with a map that he claimed showed the mine to be in Mexico itself; a pioneer named John Young went so far as to enter into partnership with Wattenberg and secure a mining permit from Porfirio Díaz, only to spend years fruitlessly trying to find it. These failures have led to debates as to what happened to the mine. Young himself believed that it had been deliberately hidden by prospectors following Kelly; another theory is that the gold was not actually gold ore, but instead pieces of refined gold left by the Spanish. A third theory is that the gold was dropped by a group of Mexicans fleeing the \"rurales\", who were forced to abandon it because it was slowing them down. Another is that, as the gold mine was allegedly in a canyon, gravel could have washed down and hidden it from view.\n\n"}

In perfectly competitive markets, market participants have no market power. A firm with total market power can raise prices without losing any customers to competitors. Market participants that have market power are therefore sometimes referred to as \"price makers\" or \"price setters\", while those without are sometimes called \"price takers\". Significant market power occurs when prices exceed marginal cost and long run average cost, so the firm makes profit.\n\nA firm with market power has the ability to individually affect either the total quantity or the prevailing price in the market. Price makers face a downward-sloping demand curve, such that price increases lead to a lower quantity demanded. The decrease in supply as a result of the exercise of market power creates an economic deadweight loss which is often viewed as socially undesirable. As a result, many countries have anti-trust or other legislation intended to limit the ability of firms to accrue market power. Such legislation often regulates mergers and sometimes introduces a judicial power to compel divestiture.\n\nA firm usually has market power by virtue of controlling a large portion of the market. In extreme cases—monopoly and monopsony—the firm controls the entire market. However, market size alone is not the only indicator of market power. Highly concentrated markets may be contestable if there are no barriers to entry or exit, limiting the incumbent firm's ability to raise its price above competitive levels.\n\nMarket power gives firms the ability to engage in unilateral anti-competitive behavior. Some of the behaviours that firms with market power are accused of engaging in include predatory pricing, product tying, and creation of overcapacity or other barriers to entry. If no individual participant in the market has significant market power, then anti-competitive behavior can take place only through collusion, or the exercise of a group of participants' collective market power.\n\nThe Lerner index and Herfindahl index may be used to measure market power.\n\nWhen several firms control a significant share of market sales, the resulting market structure is called an oligopoly or oligopsony. An oligopoly may engage in collusion, either tacit or overt, and thereby exercise market power. A group of firms that explicitly agree to affect market price or output is called a cartel.\n\nMonopoly power is an example of market failure which occurs when one or more of the participants has the ability to influence the price or other outcomes in some general or specialized market. The most commonly discussed form of market power is that of a monopoly, but other forms such as monopsony, and more moderate versions of these two extremes, exist.\n\nA well-known example of monopolistic market power is Microsoft's market share in PC operating systems. The \"United States v. Microsoft\" case dealt with an allegation that Microsoft illegally exercised its market power by bundling its web browser with its operating system. \nIn this respect, the notion of dominance and dominant position in EU Antitrust Law is a strictly related aspect.\n\nA monopoly can raise prices and retain customers because the monopoly has no competitors. If a customer has no other place to go to obtain the goods or services, they either pay the increased price or do without. Thus the key to market power is to preclude competition through high barriers of entry. Barriers to entry that are significant sources of market power are control of scarce resources, increasing returns to scale, technological superiority and government created barriers to entry. OPEC is an example of an organization that has market power due to control over scarce resources — oil. Increasing returns to scale are another important source of market power. Firms experiencing increasing returns to scale are also experiencing decreasing average total costs. Firms in such industries become more profitable with size. Therefore over time the industry is dominated by a few large firms. This dominance makes it difficult for start up firms to succeed. Firms like power companies, cable television companies and wireless communication companies with large start up costs fall within this category. A company wishing to enter such industries must have the financial ability to spend millions of dollars before starting operations and generating any revenue. Similarly established firms also have a competitive advantage over new firms. An established firm threatened by a new competitor can lower prices to drive out the competition. Microsoft is a firm that has substantial pricing or market power due to technological superiority in its design and production processes. Finally government created barriers to entry can be a source of market power. A prime example are patents granted to pharmaceutical companies. These patents give the drug companies a virtual monopoly in the protected product for the term of the patent.\n\nConcentration ratios are the most common measures of market power. The four-firm concentration ratio measures the percentage of total industry output attributable to the top four companies. For monopolies the four firm ratio is 100 per cent while the ratio is zero for perfect competition. The four firm concentration domestic (U.S) ratios for cigarettes is 93%; for automobiles, 84% and for beer, 85%.\n\nAnother measure of concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) which is calculated by \"summing the squares of the percentage market shares of all participants in the market\". The HHI index for perfect competition is zero; for monopoly, 10,000.\n\nU.S. courts almost never consider a firm to possess market power if it has a market share of less than 50 percent.\n\nMarket power is the ability to raise price above marginal cost (MC) and earn a positive profit. The degree to which a firm can raise price (P) above marginal cost depends on the shape of the demand curve at the profit maximizing output. That is, elasticity is the critical factor in determining market power. The relationship between market power and the price elasticity of demand (PED) can be summarized by the equation:\n\nNote that PED will be negative, so the ratio is always greater than one. The higher the P/MC ratio, the more market power the firm possesses. As PED increases in magnitude, the P/MC ratio approaches one, and market power approaches zero.\nThe equation is derived from the monopolist pricing rule:\n\nJean Tirole was awarded the 2014 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his analysis of market power and economic regulation.\n\n\n"}

He was a student and teacher in botany and medicine at the School of Salerno in southern Italy.\n\nHe is noted for writing a 650-page encyclopedia about medicating agents (a pharmacopoeia) which he completed about year 1317 under the Latin title \"Pandectarum Medicinae\" or \"Pandectae Medicinae\" (English: \"Encyclopedia of Medicines\"). Most of the medicating agents were botanicals (\"herbal medicines\"). The presentation is in alphabetical order. The bulk of the manuscript is compiled from earlier medicine books, including books by Dioscorides, Avicenna, Serapion the Younger, and Simon of Genoa.\n\nAs an indication of its popularity in late medieval Europe, the \"Pandectarum Medicinae\" was printed in at least eleven editions in various countries between the invention of the printing press and 1500. \n\nThe medical school in Salerno was influenced by Arabic-to-Latin translations of Arabic medical literature. As one indication of Arabic influence, 233 of 487 plant names that Matthaeus used were Latinizations of Arabic plant names. Many of those Latinized Arabic names had little circulation in Latin. Native Latin names existed for some of them, in which case Matthaeus also presents the native Latin name as well. In some cases he prefers to give primary status to the Arabic name in preference to the classical Latin name. In other cases he gives primary status to the Latin name and just mentions what the Arabic name is. \n\nThe \"Pandectarum Medicinae\" is an encyclopedia with almost no original thinking. It has considerable value to historians as a document reflecting the state of pharmacology and medicine in Europe in the late medieval era. The method of presentation in \"Pandectarum Medicinae\" is that a medicinal substance is named together with very brief identifying information and then follows several lengthier summaries or quotations from several well-known medical authorities about the substance's properties and uses. The medical authorities are either (A) the particular ancient Greek medical writers that were widely read by the medieval Arabs (particularly Diosorides and Galen) or else (B) Arabic medical writers (particularly Serapion the Younger and Avicenna).\n\nPart of Matthaeus's encyclopedia was taken from a shorter work by Simon of Genoa (aka Simon Januensis) entitled \"Synonyma Medicinae\", which was written a few decades earlier and which is a dictionary of medicines rather than an encyclopedia.\n\n"}

Designed early in the career of noted Salem builder Samuel McIntire (1757–1811), and modified later by him, the building gives a unique view into the methods and styles of McIntire. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973 for its significance as an early masterwork of one the country's first recognized master builders. It is now owned by the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nJerathmiel Peirce (1747–1827), began his career as a leather dresser. In about 1778, he formed a partnership with Aaron Waite, and purchased a two-gun schooner, the \"Greyhound\", to serve as a privateer against British merchant vessels in the Revolutionary War. The partnership prospered, and over the next half a century, purchased/built at least 10 vessels, sending them to ports around the world. In 2000, the National Park Service had a full-scale replica of one of the Waite & Peirce ships built, the \"Friendship of Salem\", which is the centerpiece of Salem Maritime National Historic Site. Waite and Peirce were also major investors in the newly incorporated Beverly Bank, and were members of Salem's merchant aristocracy. Salem was a major center of trade in the early 1800s, and as a result of this, was the home of America's first millionaire, and on a per-capita basis, was the richest city in America. Peirce went from humble beginnings to owning one of the finest homes in Salem.\nIn 1779, Peirce purchased a large lot in Salem, and in about 1782, he engaged Samuel McIntire to design and build his home there. The property he owned went all the way to the banks of the North River, where his ships tied up and he had a counting house. The house is known to have been completed by 1784, when city tax records show Peirce being assessed for a completed house. Peirce later suffered financial misfortune and was forced to sell the house. It was purchased by friends, who willed it to the children of George and Sally (Peirce) Nichols. The house remained in the Nichols family until 1917, when it was sold to the Essex Institute, predecessor to the Peabody Essex Museum. It was opened to the public in the late 1930s after the last of the Nichols owners died.\nMcIntire patterned the design of the house fairly closely on patterns found in the \"Builder's Treasury\" of Batty Langley, published in 1740. As a result, the house has late Georgian styling. This was altered in some portions in 1801, when Peirce again hired McIntire to redo the hallway east parlor in preparation for the wedding of his daughter Sally to George Nichols. This area features the lighter Federal styling that was being popularized by architect Charles Bulfinch.\n\nThe house property was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968, cited as a particularly elegant example of late Georgian craftsmanship, and for its association with McIntire. It is also a contributing element of Salem's Chestnut Street District. The Peabody Essex Museum offers tours of the house.\n\nThe Peirce–Nichols House is a three-story wood-frame building sheathed in clapboards. It has a low pitch hipped roof that is encircled by a low balustrade at the cornice, which further has a central flat section that functions as a roof deck and is also surrounded by a balustrade. The corners of the building are decorated by fluted Doric pilasters rising the height of the building. The front entry is in the center bay (of five), and is sheltered by a pedimented porch supported by Doric columns set on a brownstone step. Large twin chimneys rise through the interior of the house. The windows on the first two floors feature 6 over 6 sashes, while the third floor has typical foreshortened 3 over 6 sashes.\n\nBehind the house is a carriage house which is thought to date from the same time as the house. Its symmetrical front facade is divided into three sections, the center one featuring a projecting triangular pediment. The flanking sections are also pedimented, and are punctuated by round arched openings topped by keystones.\n\n"}
{"id": "5550409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5550409", "title": "Reference interview", "text": "Reference interview\n\nA reference interview is a conversation between a librarian and a library user, usually at a reference desk, in which the librarian responds to the user's initial explanation of his or her information need by first attempting to clarify that need and then by directing the user to appropriate information resources.\n\nBopp & Smith (1995) defines the reference interview as the \"conversation between a member of the library reference staff and a library user for the purpose of clarifying the user’s needs and aiding the user in meeting those needs\". \n\nAccording to ODLIS, the reference interview is \"the interpersonal communication that occurs between a reference librarian and a library user to determine the person's specific information need(s), which may turn out to be different from the reference question as initially posed...A reference interview may occur in person, by telephone, or electronically (usually via e-mail) at the request of the user, but a well-trained reference librarian will sometimes initiate communication if a hesitant user appears to need assistance\".\n\nThe reference interview is structured to help the librarian provide answers to the library user. In general, the interview is composed of the following stages.\n\n\nThese stages may occur in loops, for example when a clarification of the question leads to the need to establish more background information on the query topic. These steps are designed to put the user at their ease, and then help ensure that they have correctly explained what they require. When the reference librarian believes that the query is fully understood, they attempt to provide resources that help satisfy it. An important and often overlooked final step is checking that the information or service provided was indeed what the library user required.\n\nThe purpose behind the reference interview structure is to ensure that the library user's information need is satisfied. The librarian can use a number of interview techniques to help identify the user's exact need. Poor reference interview skills may lead to misinterpretation of the real question, a lack of real help and an unsatisfied library user.\n\nLibrarians use many techniques to help identify a user’s information need. With body language, repetition and paraphrasing of what the user says, the interviewer can encourage the user to give more information about what they need. Asking open questions establishes context and helps to identify exactly what is required. A lack of follow-up, or checking that the user found what they required, is arguably one of the most common mistakes made in the reference interview.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with providing an effective reference service is that of badly formed queries. In this instance, the user's reference question doesn't match up to the information they actually need. Badly formed queries may lead to user frustration, as they perceive that the reference interview is not solving their problem. \n\nMany of the techniques used in the reference interview are geared towards developing a badly formed query until a sense of the user's true information need is gained. A great degree of care must be taken when helping users to develop their query. The librarian typically has little insight into the social and psychological barriers that might be preventing the user from explaining their question accurately. Anything from anxiety from an approaching deadline to lack of confidence with language can get in the way.\n\nAs libraries have begun to adopt electronic technology into their operations, the idea of the virtual reference interview has come to light. Virtual reference is a reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time. The user and librarian do not meet face-to-face. Virtual reference services can be conducted, for example, in internet chat, videoconferencing, email, co-browsing and instant messaging. \n\nUptake of virtual reference has not been as swift as some had predicted. The complexity of virtual reference may be to blame, as users want information quickly and with the minimum of fuss. Some evidence suggests that the problem lies with poor uptake and training among library staff.\n\nLibrary users are not always comfortable with reference services, let alone satisfied with them. Unobtrusive user studies suggest that only around 55% to 65% of users leave a reference interview satisfied with the result and willing to return. Demographics, social factors and users’ preconceptions about libraries all contribute to this figure. Embarrassment, shyness, and anxiety can prevent a user from approaching the reference desk, and poor signposting and explanation of services can mean that some customers aren't aware that the reference service exists. To be as effective as possible, libraries must be proactive in publicizing their services and reducing the stigma of asking for help.\n\nFor a long time, the value of the reference interview has stood unquestioned. More recently, with technological developments streamlining some of the tasks which once comprised the interview, some researchers are beginning to question the validity of the reference interview, and the investment that a reference librarian represents. Others argue that reference services should broaden their target audience. As people increasingly use the internet to make major, life-affecting decisions, so they also require the services of professionals who are able to provide help in this environment. If this proves to be the case, it will become more vital that the reference interview be conducted professionally and successfully. In the age of information overload, a successful reference interview may empower users to confidently make such decisions in their lives.\n\n\n\n"}

Today it is kept in the Hast Imam library, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan.\n\nIn local Uzbek tradition, it is said to have belonged to the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan.\n\nBased on orthographic and palaeographic studies, the manuscript probably dates the 8th or 9th century. Radio-carbon dating showed a 95.4% probability of a date between 765 and 855. However, one of the folios from another manuscript (held in the Religious Administration of Muslims in Tashkent) was dated to between 595 and 855 A.D. with a likelihood of 95%.\n\nThe copy of the Quran is traditionally considered to be one of a group commissioned by the third caliph Uthman; however, this attribution has been questioned. In 651, 19 years after the death of the Islamic Prophet, Muhammad, Uthman commissioned a committee to produce a standard copy of the text of the Quran (see Origin and development of the Quran). Five of these authoritative Qurans were sent to the major Muslim cities of the era, and Uthman kept one for his own use in Medina, although the Samarkand Quran is most likely not one of those copies. The only other surviving copy was thought to be the one held in Topkapı Palace in Turkey, but studies have shown that the Topkapı manuscript is also not from the 7th century, but from much later.\n\nUthman was succeeded by Ali, who took the uthmanic Quran to Kufa, now in Iraq. The subsequent history of this Quran is known only from legends. According to one of them, when Tamerlane destroyed the area, he took the Quran to his capital, Samarkand, as a treasure. According to another, the Quran was brought from the caliph of Rum to Samarkand by Khoja Ahrar, a Turkestani sufi master, as a gift after he had cured the caliph. \nThe Quran remained in the Khoja Ahrar Mosque of Samarkand for four centuries until 1869, when the Russian general Abramov bought it from the mullahs of the mosque and gave it to Konstantin von Kaufman, Governor-General of Turkestan, who in turn sent it to the Imperial Library in Saint Petersburg (now the Russian National Library). It attracted the attention of Orientalists and eventually a facsimile edition was published in Saint-Petersburg in 1905. The 50 copies soon became rarities. The first thorough description and dating of the manuscript was undertaken by the Russian Orientalist Shebunin in 1891.\n\nAfter the October Revolution, Vladimir Lenin, in an act of goodwill to the Muslims of Russia, gave the Quran to the people of Ufa, Bashkortostan. After repeated appeals by the people of the Turkestan ASSR, the Quran was returned to Central Asia, to Tashkent, in 1924, where it has since remained.\n\nThe parchment manuscript now is held in the library of the Telyashayakh Mosque, in the old \"Hast-Imam\" (Khazrati Imom) area of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, close to the grave of Kaffal Shashi, a 10th-century Islamic scholar.\n\nA folio containing a page from the sura Al-Anbiya is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThe manuscript is incomplete: it begins in the middle of verse 7 of the second sura and ends at Surah 43:10.

Guggenheim Museum, often referred to as The Guggenheim, is an art museum located at 1071 Fifth Avenue on the corner of East 89th Street in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It is the permanent home of a continuously expanding collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, early Modern and contemporary art and also features special exhibitions throughout the year. The museum was established by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in 1939 as the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, under the guidance of its first director, the artist Hilla von Rebay. It adopted its current name after the death of its founder, Solomon R. Guggenheim, in 1952.\n\nIn 1959, the museum moved from rented space to its current building, a landmark work of 20th-century architecture. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the cylindrical building, wider at the top than the bottom, was conceived as a \"temple of the spirit\". Its unique ramp gallery extends up from ground level in a long, continuous spiral along the outer edges of the building to end just under the ceiling skylight. The building underwent extensive expansion and renovations in 1992 (when an adjoining tower was built) and from 2005 to 2008.\n\nThe museum's collection has grown organically, over eight decades, and is founded upon several important private collections, beginning with Solomon R. Guggenheim's original collection. The collection is shared with the museum's sister museums in Bilbao, Spain, and elsewhere. In 2013, nearly 1.2 million people visited the museum, and it hosted the most popular exhibition in New York City.\n\nSolomon R. Guggenheim, a member of a wealthy mining family, had been collecting works of the old masters since the 1890s. In 1926, he met artist Hilla von Rebay, who introduced him to European avant-garde art, in particular abstract art that she felt had a spiritual and utopian aspect (non-objective art). Guggenheim completely changed his collecting strategy, turning to the work of Wassily Kandinsky, among others. He began to display his collection to the public at his apartment in the Plaza Hotel in New York City. As the collection grew, he established the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, in 1937, to foster the appreciation of modern art.\n\nThe foundation's first venue for the display of art, the \"Museum of Non-Objective Painting\", opened in 1939 under the direction of Rebay, in midtown Manhattan. Under Rebay's guidance, Guggenheim sought to include in the collection the most important examples of non-objective art available at the time by early modernists such as Rudolf Bauer, Rebay, Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Marc Chagall, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger, Amedeo Modigliani and Pablo Picasso.\n\nBy the early 1940s, the foundation had accumulated such a large collection of avant-garde paintings that the need for a permanent museum building had become apparent. In 1943, Rebay and Guggenheim wrote a letter to Frank Lloyd Wright asking him to design a structure to house and display the collection. Wright accepted the opportunity to experiment with his organic style in an urban setting. It took him 15 years, 700 sketches, and six sets of working drawings to create the museum.\n\nIn 1948, the collection was greatly expanded through the purchase of art dealer Karl Nierendorf's estate of some 730 objects, notably German expressionist paintings. By that time, the foundation's collection included a broad spectrum of expressionist and surrealist works, including paintings by Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Joan Miró. After Guggenheim's death in 1949, members of the Guggenheim family who sat on the foundation's board of directors had personal and philosophical differences with Rebay, and in 1952 she resigned as director of the museum. Nevertheless, she left a portion of her personal collection to the foundation in her will, including works by Kandinsky, Klee, Alexander Calder, Albert Gleizes, Mondrian and Kurt Schwitters. The museum was renamed the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1952.\n\nRebay conceived of the space as a \"temple of the spirit\" that would facilitate a new way of looking at the modern pieces in the collection. She wrote to Wright that \"each of these great masterpieces should be organized into space, and only you ... would test the possibilities to do so. ... I want a temple of spirit, a monument!\" The critic Paul Goldberger later wrote that, before Wright's modernist building, \"there were only two common models for museum design: Beaux-arts Palace ... and the International Style Pavilion.\" Goldberger thought the building a catalyst for change, making it \"socially and culturally acceptable for an architect to design a highly expressive, intensely personal museum. In this sense almost every museum of our time is a child of the Guggenheim.\"\nFrom 1943 to early 1944, Wright produced four different sketches for the initial design. While one of the plans (scheme C) had a hexagonal shape and level floors for the galleries, all the others had circular schemes and used a ramp continuing around the building. He had experimented with the ramp design on the house he completed for his son in 1952, the David & Gladys Wright House in Arizona. Wright's original concept was called an inverted \"ziggurat\", because it resembled the steep steps on the ziggurats built in ancient Mesopotamia. His design dispensed with the conventional approach to museum layout, in which visitors are led through a series of interconnected rooms and forced to retrace their steps when exiting. Wright's plan was for the museum guests to ride to the top of the building by elevator, to descend at a leisurely pace along the gentle slope of the continuous ramp, and to view the atrium of the building as the last work of art. The open rotunda afforded viewers the unique possibility of seeing several bays of work on different levels simultaneously and even to interact with guests on other levels.\n\nAt the same time, before settling on the site for the museum at the corner of 89th Street and Fifth Avenue, overlooking Central Park, Wright, Rebay and Guggenheim considered numerous locations in Manhattan, as well as in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, overlooking the Hudson River. Guggenheim felt that the site's proximity to Central Park was important; the park afforded relief from the noise, congestion and concrete of the city. Nature also provided the museum with inspiration. The building embodies Wright's attempts \"to render the inherent plasticity of organic forms in architecture.\" The Guggenheim was to be the only museum designed by Wright. The city location required Wright to design the building in a vertical rather than a horizontal form, far different from his earlier, rural works.\nThe spiral design recalled a nautilus shell, with continuous spaces flowing freely one into another. Even as it embraced nature, Wright's design also expresses his take on modernist architecture's rigid geometry. Wright ascribed a symbolic meaning to the building's shapes. He explained, \"these geometric forms suggest certain human ideas, moods, sentiments – as for instance: the circle, infinity; the triangle, structural unity; the spiral, organic progress; the square, integrity.\" Forms echo one another throughout: oval-shaped columns, for example, reiterate the geometry of the fountain. Circularity is the leitmotif, from the rotunda to the inlaid design of the terrazzo floors. Several architecture professors have speculated that the double spiral staircase designed by Giuseppe Momo in 1932 at the Vatican Museums was an inspiration for Wright's ramp and atrium. Jaroslav Josef Polívka assisted Wright with the structural design and managed to design the gallery ramp without perimeter columns.\n\nThe Guggenheim's surface was made out of concrete to reduce the cost, inferior to the stone finish that Wright had wanted. Wright proposed a red-colored exterior, which was never realized. The small rotunda (or \"Monitor building\", as Wright called it) next to the large rotunda was intended to house apartments for Rebay and Guggenheim but instead became offices and storage space. In 1965, the second floor of the Monitor building was renovated to display the museum's growing permanent collection, and with the restoration of the museum in 1990–92, it was turned over entirely to exhibition space and christened the Thannhauser Building, in honor of one of the most important bequests to the museum. Wright's original plan for an adjoining tower, artists' studios and apartments went unrealized, largely for financial reasons, until the renovation and expansion. Also in the original construction, the main gallery skylight had been covered, which compromised Wright's carefully articulated lighting effects. This changed in 1992 when the skylight was restored to its original design.\n\nIn 1953, the foundation's collecting criteria expanded under its new director, James Johnson Sweeney. Sweeney rejected Rebay's dismissal of \"objective\" painting and sculpture, and he soon acquired Constantin Brâncuși's \"Adam and Eve\" (1921), followed by works of other modernist sculptors, including Joseph Csaky, Jean Arp, Calder, Alberto Giacometti and David Smith. Sweeney reached beyond the 20th century to acquire Paul Cézanne's \"Man with Crossed Arms\" (c. 1899). The same year, the foundation also received a gift of 28 important works from the Estate of Katherine S. Dreier, a founder of America's first collection to be called a modern art museum, the Société Anonyme. Dreier had been a colleague of Rebay's. The works included \"Little French Girl\" (1914–18) by Brâncuși, an untitled still life (1916) by Juan Gris, a bronze sculpture (1919) by Alexander Archipenko and three collages (1919–21) by German Hanoverian Dadaist Schwitters. It also included works by Calder, Marcel Duchamp, El Lissitzky and Mondrian. Among others, Sweeney also acquired the works of Alberto Giacometti, David Hayes, Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock.\n\nSweeney oversaw the last half dozen years of the construction of the museum building, during which time he had an antagonistic relationship with Frank Lloyd Wright, especially regarding the building's lighting issues. The distinctive cylindrical building turned out to be Wright's last major work, as the architect died six months before its opening. From the street, the building looks like a white ribbon curled into a cylindrical stack, wider at the top than the bottom, displaying nearly all curved surfaces. Its appearance is in sharp contrast to the typically rectangular Manhattan buildings that surround it, a fact relished by Wright, who claimed that his museum would make the nearby Metropolitan Museum of Art \"look like a Protestant barn.\" Internally, the viewing gallery forms a helical spiral ramp climbing gently from ground level to the skylight at the top.\n\nEven before it opened, the design polarized architecture critics. Some believed that the building would overshadow the museum's artworks. \"On the contrary\", wrote the architect, the design makes \"the building and the painting an uninterrupted, beautiful symphony such as never existed in the World of Art before.\" Other critics, and many artists, felt that it is awkward to properly hang paintings in the shallow, windowless, concave exhibition niches that surround the central spiral. Prior to the opening of the museum twenty-one artists signed a letter protesting the display of their work in such a space. Historian Lewis Mumford summed up the opprobrium:\n\nWright has allotted the paintings and sculptures on view only as much space as would not infringe upon his abstract composition. ... [He] created a shell whose form has no relation to its function and offered no possibility of future departure from his rigid preconceptions. [The promenade] has, for a museum, a low ceiling – nine feet eight inches [295 cm] [limiting painting size. The wall] slanted outward, following the outward slant of the exterior wall, and paintings were not supposed to be hung vertically or shown in their true plane but were to be tilted back against it. ... Nor [can a visitor] escape the light shining in his eyes from the narrow slots in the wall.\n\nOn October 21, 1959, ten years after the death of Solomon Guggenheim and six months after the death of Frank Lloyd Wright, the Museum first opened its doors to large crowds. The building became widely praised and inspired many other architects.\n\nThomas M. Messer succeeded Sweeney as director of the museum (but not the foundation) in 1961 and stayed for 27 years, the longest tenure of any of the city's major arts institutions' directors. When Messer took over, the museum's ability to present art at all was still in doubt due to the challenges presented by continuous spiral ramp gallery that is both tilted and has non-vertical curved walls. It is difficult to properly hang paintings in the shallow, windowless exhibition niches that surround the central spiral: canvasses must be mounted raised from the wall's surface. Paintings hung slanted back would appear \"as on the artist's easel\". There is limited space within the niches for sculpture.\n\nAlmost immediately, in 1962, Messer took a risk putting on a large exhibition that combined the Guggenheim's paintings with sculptures on loan from the Hirshhorn collection. Three-dimensional sculpture, in particular, raised \"the problem of installing such a show in a museum bearing so close a resemblance to the circular geography of hell\", where any vertical object appears tilted in a \"drunken lurch\" because the slope of the floor and the curvature of the walls could combine to produce vexing optical illusions. It turned out that the combination could work well in the Guggenheim's space, but, Messer recalled that at the time, \"I was scared. I half felt that this would be my last exhibition.\" Messer had the foresight to prepare by staging a smaller sculpture exhibition the previous year, in which he discovered how to compensate for the space's weird geometry by constructing special plinths at a particular angle, so the pieces were not at a true vertical yet appeared to be so. In the earlier sculpture show, this trick proved impossible for one piece, an Alexander Calder mobile whose wire inevitably hung at a true plumb vertical, \"suggesting hallucination\" in the disorienting context of the tilted floor.\n\nThe next year, Messer acquired a private collection from art dealer Justin K. Thannhauser for the museum's permanent collection. These 73 works include Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and French modern masterpieces, including important works by Paul Gauguin, Édouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Vincent van Gogh and 32 works by Pablo Picasso. \"Works and Process\" is a series of performances at the Guggenheim begun in 1984. The first season consisted of Philip Glass with Christopher Keene on \"Akhnaten\" and Steve Reich and Michael Tilson Thomas on \"The Desert Music\".\n\nThomas Krens, director of the foundation from 1988 to 2008, led a rapid expansion of the museum's collections. In 1991, he broadened its holdings by acquiring the Panza Collection. Assembled by Count Giuseppe di Biumo and his wife, Giovanna, the Panza Collection includes examples of Minimalist sculptures by Carl Andre, Dan Flavin and Donald Judd, and Minimalist paintings by Robert Mangold, Brice Marden and Robert Ryman, as well as an array of Post-Minimal, Conceptual, and perceptual art by Robert Morris, Richard Serra, James Turrell, Lawrence Weiner and others, notably American examples of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1992, the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation gifted 200 of his best photographs to the foundation. The works spanned his entire output, from his early collages, Polaroids, portraits of celebrities, self-portraits, male and female nudes, flowers and statues. It also featured mixed-media constructions and included his well-known 1998 \"Self-Portrait\". The acquisition initiated the foundation's photography exhibition program.\n\nAlso in 1992, the New York museum building's exhibition and other space was expanded by the addition of an adjoining rectangular tower that stands behind, and taller than, the original spiral, and a renovation of the original building. The new tower was designed by the architectural firm of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects, who analyzed Wright's original sketches when they designed the 10-story limestone tower, which replaced a much smaller structure. It has four additional exhibition galleries with flat walls that are \"more appropriate for the display of art.\" In the original construction of the building, the main gallery skylight had been covered, which compromised Wright's carefully articulated lighting effects. This changed in 1992 when the skylight was restored to its original design. By that point, the building had become iconic enough that this augmentation of Wright's original design was itself controversial.\nTo finance these moves, controversially, the foundation sold works by Kandinsky, Chagall and Modigliani to raise $47 million, drawing considerable criticism for trading masters for \"trendy\" latecomers. In \"The New York Times\", critic Michael Kimmelman wrote that the sales \"stretched the accepted rules of deaccessioning further than many American institutions have been willing to do.\" Krens defended the action as consistent with the museum's principles, including expanding its international collection and building its \"postwar collection to the strength of our pre-war holdings\" and pointed out that such sales are a regular practice by museums. At the same time, he moved to expand the foundation's international presence by opening museums abroad. Krens was also criticized for his businesslike style and perceived populism and commercialization. One writer commented, \"Krens has been both praised and vilified for turning what was once a small New York institution into a worldwide brand, creating the first truly multinational arts institution. ... Krens transformed the Guggenheim into one of the best-known brand name in the arts.\"\n\nUnder Krens, the museum mounted some of its most popular exhibitions: \"Africa: The Art of a Continent,\" in 1996; \"China: 5,000 Years,\" in 1998, \"Brazil: Body & Soul,\" in 2001; and \"The Aztec Empire,\" in 2004. It has shown unusual exhibitions on occasion, for example commercial art installations of motorcycles. \"The New Criterion\"'s Hilton Kramer condemned \"The Art of the Motorcycle\" A 2009 retrospective of Frank Lloyd Wright showcased the architect on the 50th anniversary of the opening of the building and was the museum's most popular exhibit since it began keeping such attendance records in 1992.\nIn 2001, the museum opened the Sackler Center for Arts Education. The facility provides classes and lectures about the visual and performing arts and opportunities to interact with the museum's collections and special exhibitions through its labs, exhibition spaces, conference rooms and 266-seat Peter B. Lewis Theater. It is located on the lower level of the museum, below the large rotunda and was a gift of the Mortimer D. Sackler family. Also in 2001, the foundation received a gift of the large collection of the Bohen Foundation, which, for two decades, commissioned new works of art with an emphasis on film, video, photography and new media. Artists included in the collection are Pierre Huyghe and Sophie Calle.\n\nBetween September 2005 and July 2008, the Guggenheim Museum underwent a significant exterior restoration to repair cracks and modernize systems and exterior details. In the first phase of this project, a team of restoration architects, structural engineers, and architectural conservators worked together to create a comprehensive assessment of the building's condition that determined the structure to be fundamentally sound. This initial condition assessment included:\n\nMuch of the interior of the building was restored during the 1992 renovation and addition by Gwathmey Siegel and Associates Architects. The 2005–2008 restoration primarily addressed the exterior of the original building and the infrastructure. This included the skylights, windows, doors, concrete and gunite facades and exterior sidewalk, as well as the climate-control. The goal was to preserve as much significant historical fabric of the museum as possible, while accomplishing necessary repairs and attaining a suitable environment for the building's continuing use as a museum.\n\nOn September 22, 2008, the Guggenheim celebrated the completion of a three-year restoration project. New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg officiated at the celebration that culminated with the premiere of artist Jenny Holzer's tribute \"For the Guggenheim\", a work commissioned in honor of Peter B. Lewis, who was a major benefactor in the Museum restoration project. Other supporters of the $29 million restoration included the Board of Trustees of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, and the city's Department of Cultural Affairs. Additional support was provided by the State of New York and MAPEI Corporation. The museum was registered as a National Historic Landmark on October 6, 2008.\n\nIn 2005, Krens won a dispute with billionaire philanthropist Peter B. Lewis, chairman of the foundation's Board of Directors and the largest contributor to the foundation in its history. Lewis resigned from the Board, expressing opposition to Krens' plans for further global expansion of the Guggenheim museums. Also in 2005, Lisa Dennison, a longtime Guggenheim curator, was appointed director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. Dennison resigned in July 2007, to work at the auction house Sotheby's. Tensions between Krens and the Board continued, and in February 2008 Krens stepped down as the Director of the foundation, although he remains an advisor for international affairs.\n\nRichard Armstrong, formerly director of Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Art, became the fifth director of the museum on November 4, 2008. He had been director of the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for 12 years, where he had also served as chief curator and curator of contemporary art. The Chief curator and deputy director of the museum is Nancy Spector.\n\nIn addition to its permanent collections, which continue to grow, the foundation administers loan exhibitions and co-organizes exhibitions with other museums to foster public outreach. In 2013, nearly 1.2 million people visited the museum, and its James Turrell exhibition was the most popular in New York City in terms of daily attendance.\n\nIn the 2009 film \"The International\", a shootout occurs in the museum. A life-size replica of the museum was built for this scene.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

{"id": "1873693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1873693", "title": "Taste of Cherry", "text": "Taste of Cherry\n\nTaste of Cherry (, \"Ta’m-e gīlās...\") is a 1997 Iranian drama film written, produced and directed by Abbas Kiarostami. It is a minimalist film about a man who drives through a city suburb, in search of someone who can carry out the task of burying him after he commits suicide. It was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMr Badii (Homayoun Ershadi), a middle-aged man, drives through Tehran looking for someone to do a job for him, and he offers a large amount of money in return. During his drives with prospective candidates, Badii reveals that he plans to kill himself and has already dug the grave. He needs someone to throw earth on his body, after his death. He does not discuss why he wants to commit suicide.\n\nHis first recruit is a young, shy Kurdish soldier, who refuses to do the job and flees from Badii's car. His second recruit is an Afghan seminarist, who also declines because he has religious objections to suicide. The third is an Azeri taxidermist. He is willing to help Badii because he needs the money for his sick child, but tries to talk him out of it; he reveals that he too wanted to commit suicide a long time ago but chose to live when he tasted mulberries. The Azeri promises to throw earth on Badii if he finds him dead in the morning. That night, Badii lies in his grave while a thunderstorm begins. After a long blackout, the film ends by breaking the fourth wall with camcorder footage of Kiarostami and the film crew filming \"Taste of Cherry\".\n\n\nThe film is minimalist in that it is shot primarily with long takes; the pace is leisurely and there are long periods of silence. Mr. Badii is rarely shown in the same shot as the person he is talking to (this is partly because during the filming, director Kiarostami was sitting in the car's passenger seat).\n\nKiarostami's style in the film is notable for the use of long shots, such as in the closing sequences. He creates distance for the audience from the characters to stimulate reflection on their fate. \"Taste of Cherry\" is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is conversing with a passenger. The visual distancing stand in contrast to the sound of the dialog, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity can be seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments. \n\nThe film does not include a background score, except for the ending titles. This features a trumpet piece, Louis Armstrong's 1929 adaptation of \"St. James Infirmary Blues.\" The only song featured in the film is \"Khuda Bowad Yaret\" (May God be your protector) by Afghan singer Ahmad Zaher, which is played in the background on a radio.\n\n\"Taste of Cherry\" was awarded the prestigious Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival in the year of its release, tied with Shohei Imamura's \"The Eel\".\n\nWhen the film was released in the United States, however, it met with a split reaction among critics and audiences. Roger Ebert wrote a scathing review in \"The Chicago Sun-Times\", giving the film a mere 1 out of 4 stars. Ebert dismissed the film as \"excruciatingly boring\" and added, \"I understand intellectually what Kiarostami is doing. I am not impatiently asking for action or incident. What I do feel, however, is that Kiarostami's style here is an affectation; the subject matter does not make it necessary, and is not benefited by it. If we're to feel sympathy for Badhi, wouldn't it help to know more about him? To know, in fact, anything at all about him? What purpose does it serve to suggest at first he may be a homosexual? (Not what purpose for the audience--what purpose for Badhi himself? Surely he must be aware his intentions are being misinterpreted.) And why must we see Kiarostami's camera crew--a tiresome distancing strategy to remind us we are seeing a movie? If there is one thing \"Taste of Cherry\" does not need, it is such a reminder: The film is such a lifeless drone that we experience it only as a movie.\" \n\nEbert later went on to add the film to a list of his most hated movies of all time. \n\nIn his own review of Kiarostami's film, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader awarded it a full four stars. Responding to Ebert's criticisms, Rosenbaum wrote: \"A colleague who finds \"Taste of Cherry\" \"excruciatingly boring\" objects in particular to the fact that we don’t know anything about Badii, to what he sees as the distracting suggestion that Badii might be a homosexual looking for sex, and to what he sees as the tired \"distancing strategy\" of reminding us at the end that we’re seeing a movie. From the perspective of the history of commercial Western cinema, he has a point on all three counts. But Kiarostami couldn’t care less about conforming to that perspective, and given what he can do, I can’t think of any reason he should care... the most important thing about the joyful finale is that it’s the precise opposite of a \"distancing effect.\" It does invite us into the laboratory from which the film sprang and places us on an equal footing with the filmmaker, yet it does this in a spirit of collective euphoria, suddenly liberating us from the oppressive solitude and darkness of Badii alone in his grave. Shifting to the soldiers reminds us of the happiest part of Badii’s life, and a tree in full bloom reminds us of the Turkish taxidermist’s epiphany — though the soldiers also signify the wars that made both the Kurdish soldier and the Afghan seminarian refugees, and a tree is where the Turk almost hanged himself. Kiarostami is representing life in all its rich complexity, reconfiguring elements from the preceding 80-odd minutes in video to clarify what’s real and what’s concocted. (The \"army\" is under Kiarostami’s command, but it is Ershadi — an architect friend of the filmmaker in real life — who passes Kiarostami a cigarette.) Far from affirming that \"Taste of Cherry\" is \"only\" a movie, this wonderful ending is saying, among other things, that it’s also a movie. And we don’t have to remember all of the lyrics of \"St. James Infirmary\" to know that death is waiting for us around the corner.\"\n\nThe Criterion Collection entered \"Taste of Cherry\" into their exclusive film collection on June 1, 1999. Since the film's release, multiple other critics have also declared it a masterpiece; in the British Film Institute's 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" poll, six critics and two directors named \"Taste of Cherry\" one of the 10 best films ever made.\n\n"}
