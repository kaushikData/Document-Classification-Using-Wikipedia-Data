Williams' dictionary includes, in addition to Mandarin, Chinese variants from Middle Chinese and four regional varieties of Chinese, according to the 17th-century \"Wufang yuanyin\" 五方元音 \"Proto-sounds of Speech in All Directions\".\n\nThe lengthy English title \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language: Arranged According to the Wu-Fang Yuen Yin, with the Pronunciation of the Characters as Heard in Peking, Canton, Amoy, and Shanghai\" refers to the influential rime dictionary of Chinese varieties compiled by Fan Tengfeng 樊騰鳳 (1601-1664), the \"Wufang yuanyin\" 五方元音 \"Proto-sounds of Speech in All Directions\" (Yong and Peng 2008: 358-359). A Chinese rime dictionary (as differentiated from a rhyming dictionary) collates characters according to the phonological model of a rime table, arranged by initials, finals, and the classical four tones of Middle Chinese pronunciation.\n\nThe Chinese title \"Hàn-Yīng yùnfǔ 漢英韻府\" (lit. \"Chinese-English Rime Dictionary\") combines two words that commonly occur in dictionary titles. \"Hàn-Yīng\" 漢英 means \"Chinese-English\" and \"yùnfǔ\" 韻府 (lit. \"rime storehouse\") means \"rime dictionary\". For example, the Yuan dynasty (c. 1280) \"Yunfu qunyu\" 韻府群玉 \"Assembled Jade-tablets Rime Dictionary\" compiled by Yin Shifu 陰時夫, the Qing dynasty (1711) \"Peiwen yunfu\", and especially Morrison's \"A Dictionary of the Chinese Language\" Part II or \"Wuche yunfu\" 五車韻府 \"Erudite Rime Dictionary\".\n\nSamuel Wells Williams (1812-1884), known as Wèi Sānwèi 衛三畏 in Chinese (Wei 衛 is a surname), was an American missionary, diplomat, and sinologist. In 1833, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions sent Williams to manage their printing press of at Canton (present-day Guangzhou) China. After a productive 40 years spent in China, Williams returned to the United States in 1877 and became the first Professor of Chinese language and literature at Yale University.\n\nWilliams was a prolific writer, translator, lexicographer, and editor. For English-speaking students of Chinese as a foreign language, he wrote (1842) \"Easy Lessons in Chinese: or Progressive Exercises to Facilitate the Study of that Language\". Prior to compiling \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\", he published two specialized dictionaries. The (1844) \"An English and Chinese Vocabulary in the Court Dialect\", or \" Ying Hwá Yun-fú Lih-kiái\" 英華韻府歷階 \"English-Chinese Mandarin Rime Dictionary\", was intended to replace Morrison's (1828) \"Vocabulary of the Canton Dialect: Chinese Words and Phrases\", which was out-of-print. \"Court Dialect\" refers to \"guānhuà\" 官話 (lit. \"official speech\") or the late imperial Mandarin koiné spoken in Beijing. Williams' (1856) \"A Tonic Dictionary of the Chinese Language in the Canton Dialect\" or \"ˌYing ˌWá ˌFan Wanˈ Ts'ütˌ Lúˈ\" 英華分韻提要 (\"English-Chinese Summary of Tonal Divisions\") includes 7,850 characters commonly used in Cantonese (Yong & Peng 2008: 388).\n\nSamuel Williams spent 11 years compiling \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\". The dictionary preface (1874: v) explains that he first planned to rearrange \"A Tonic Dictionary of the Chinese Language in the Canton Dialect\" and \"fit it for general use\" but he soon realized that its \"incompleteness required an entire revision\". Williams began compilation in 1863, when he was chargé d'affaires for the United States in Beijing, and after realizing that foreigners required more than a wordlist of common Chinese terms, he decided to produce a successor to Morrison's dictionary (Williams 1889: 346).\n\nSources that Williams consulted include Part II of Morrison's dictionary, Gonçalves' (1833) \"Diccionario China-Portuguez\", De Guignes' (1813) \"Dictionnaire Chinois\", and his \"A Tonic Dictionary\" of Cantonese. Although he said, \"Dr. Medhurst's translation of the K'anghi Tsz'tien\" has been much used\", the principal source for definitions was the original \"Kangxi zidian\", which \"imperfect as it is according to our ideas of a lexicon, is still the most convenient work of the kind in the language\" (1974: vi). The explanations of character origins (\"etymological definitions\") are taken from Sha Mu's 沙木 (1787) \"Yiwen beilan\" 藝文備覽 \"Literary Writings for Consultance\".\n\nSamuel Williams describes the ideal Chinese bilingual dictionary.\nThe plan of a Chinese lexicon to satisfy all the needs of a foreigner, should comprise the general and vernacular pronunciations, with the tones used in various places, and the sounds given to each character as its meanings vary. The history and composition of the character, its uses in various epochs, and its authorized and colloquial meanings should be explained and illustrated by suitable examples. All this knowledge should be methodically arranged so as to be accessible with the least possible trouble. But even when arranged and ready, the foreigner would find it to be incomplete for all his purposes by reason of the local usages, ... (1874: vii) \nYong and Peng (2008: 387) interpret this desideratum as Williams' explanation for including regional pronunciation variants in \"A Syllabic Dictionary\", and say, \"As good as his intention was, it was highly doubtful whether he could achieve his goal.\"\n\nIn an 1865 letter to his son, Williams compares working on the dictionary with his camel ride from Cairo to Gaza, a \"monotonous travel through a dreary sameness, relieved by a few shrubs, and sometimes a flower\", and says he finds Chinese literature so \"destitute of imagination\" that \"making a dictionary to elucidate it is indeed a drudgery\" (Williams 1889: 360).\n\nIn November 1871, Williams traveled to Shanghai to oversee printing of the dictionary, and returned intermittently until publication in 1874 (Williams 1889: 390). After thieves stole 250 stereotype printing plates of the dictionary from the Mission House in 1879, Williams made corrections and additions for the revised pages, which were used in a new 1881 edition (Williams 1889: 440). The American Presbyterian Mission Press continued to reprint Williams' original \"A Syllabic Dictionary\" for 30 years up until 1903.\n\nIn 1909, a revised edition that replaced Williams' romanization system with standard Wade-Giles was published: \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language Arranged According to the Wu-Fang Yüan Yin. By S. Wells Williams, LL. D., and Alphabetically Rearranged According to the Romanization of Sir Thomas F. Wade, by a Committee of the North China Mission of the American Board\".\n\nIn the history of bilingual Chinese lexicography, Williams' \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\" was published 51 years after Robert Morrison's 4,595-page \"A Dictionary of the Chinese Language\" and 32 years after Walter Henry Medhurst's 1,486-page \"Chinese and English Dictionary\". Williams adapted and incorporated from both dictionaries. Williams' 10,940 Chinese character head entries compare with the 12,674 numbered entries in Part II of Morrison's (1815-1823) \"A Dictionary of the Chinese Language, in Three Parts\", which is likewise collated alphabetically by pronunciation of 411 syllables, and with the approximately 12,000 head entries in Medhurst's (1842) \"Chinese and English Dictionary: Containing All the Words in the Chinese Imperial Dictionary, Arranged According to the Radicals\".\n\nThe 1150-page \"Syllabic Dictionary\" is preceded by the front matter with a 6-page preface and an 84-page introduction. The latter introduces the \"Wufang yuanyin\", orthography, aspiration, tones, Middle Chinese (\"Old Sounds\") pronunciations, the range of regional Chinese varieties, a table with 8 regional pronunciations of an extract from the (1724) \"Sacred Edict of the Kangxi Emperor\", a table of the 214 Kangxi radicals, and a table of 1040 character phonetics (\"primitives\"), for example (1874: lxii), [\"zhōng\"] 中 \"middle\", [\"shǎo\"] 少 \"few\", and [\"zhù\"] 宁 \"vestibule\".\n\nWilliams' preface to \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language \" explains, \"The number of characters in this work is 12,527, contained in 10,940 articles, and placed under 522 syllables, which follow each other alphabetically, aspirated syllables coming after the unaspirated. Those syllables which begin with \"ts\", on account of their number, are placed by themselves after \"tw'an\"\" (1874: ix). The additional 1,587 characters are differently written variant characters. For instance, the standard character 醫 for \"yī\" \"medical doctor\" has 酉 \"wine vessel\" indicating medicinal wine, but the earlier variant character 毉 has 巫 \"Chinese shaman\" indicating shamanic healing.\n\nRime dictionaries are arranged in terms of the classical four tones of Middle Chinese pronunciation: \"píng\" 平 \"level\" tone, \"shǎng\" 上 \"rising\" tone, \"qù\" 去 \"departing\" tone, and \"rù\" 入 \"entering\" tone. Most western-language dictionaries of Chinese represent tones by marking vowels with diacritics, Morrison's dictionary, for instance, indicates \"level\" tone as unmarked (\"a\"), \"rising\" with grave accent (\"à\"), \"departing\" with acute accent (\"á\"), and \"entering\" tone with \"short accent\" (\"ǎ\"). As a result of using 17th-century \"Wufang yuanyin\" pronunciations, early Chinese-English dictionaries were much concerned with the \"entering\" tone, which had already ceased to exist in 19th-century Beijing pronunciation (Norman 1988: 173).\n\nWilliams' dictionary represents the four tones in the same uncommon method as his (1842) \"Easy Lessons in Chinese\": semicircles written in one of the four corners of a character (the linguistic term \"fāngkuàizì\" 方塊字, lit. \"square character\", means \"Chinese character; square print\") or pronunciation. He explains that Chinese schoolmasters mark the tone of every character in their students' printed books in order to facilitate reading aloud; with a semicircle in the character's lower left corner for \"level\" tone, in the upper left for \"rising\", in the upper right for \"departing\", and in the lower right for \"entering\" tone.\n\nThe head entry format in Williams' dictionary is the regular script character over the Peking Mandarin pronunciation (and an empty space \"if one wishes to write the local sound beside the Pekingese\"), both character and pronunciation are marked with a corner semicircle to indicate tone, an explanation of the character's origin, English translation equivalents, and usage examples (totaling about 53,000, 1874: ix).\n\nThe Chinese character 道 for \"dào\" \"way; path; say; the Dao\" or \"dǎo\" \"guide; lead; conduct; instruct; direct\" (or 導 clarified with Radical 41 寸 \"thumb; inch\") is a good litmus test for a dictionary because it has two pronunciations and complex semantics. Williams dictionary sample entry 道ʼ (1874: 867, shown to the right) gives the regular script character over the \"taoʼ\" pronunciation gloss (both marked with a semicircle to the upper right indicating \"qù\" 去 \"departing\" tone), explanation of character origin, English translation equivalents, and usage examples.\n\nThe dictionary's phonological section headings are according to standard Beijing dialect pronunciation, and note variant ones from Middle Chinese (\"Old sounds\") and four regional varieties of Chinese spoken in Treaty ports where Protestant missionaries were active. \"Swatow\" or Shantou in Guangdong province refers to Shantou dialect, a Southern Min variety, \"Amoy\" or Xiamen in Fujian province to Amoy dialect, another Southern Min variety, also in Fujian province, \"Fuchau\" or Fuzhou refers to Fuzhou dialect, the prestige form of Eastern Min, and \"Shanghai\" to Shanghainese, a variety of Wu Chinese. Thus, the TAO heading (1874: 865) says, \"\"Old sounds\", to, do, tot, \"and\" dok. \"In Canton\", tò; – \"in Swatow\", to \"and\" tau; – \"in Amoy\", tò \"and\" tiau; – \"in Fuchau\", to \"and\" t'o; – \"in Shanghai\", to \"and\" do; – \"in Chifu\", tao.\"\n\nThe logographic explanation of 道 (which combines Radical 162 辵 or 辶 \"walk; go\" and Radical 181 首 \"head\"; stroke order is animated here) says, \"From \"to go\" and the \"head\"; q. d. being at the head\"; and \"occurs used with the next and last\" refers to the subsequent two variant character entries, 衜 with Radical 144 行 \"go\" instead of Radical 162 \"From \"to walk\" and a \"head\"; interchanged with the preceding\", and 導 with Radical 41 \"From an \"inch\" and \"road\"\".\n\nThe 24 English translation equivalents include both common \"dào\" meanings and specialized ones in Chinese geography, traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese philosophy, Chinese Buddhism, Daoism (calling Daoists \"Rationalists\"), and Chinese grammar.\nA road, path, or way; in \"geography\", a zone or belt; in \"medicine\", anal and urinal passages; a circuit; the officer who oversees a circuit or region; a principle, a doctrine, that which the mind approves; and used in the classics in the sense of the right path in which one ought to go, either in ruling or observing rules; rectitude or right reason; in early times up to A. D. 500, the Buddhists called themselves |人 men [seeking for] reason or intelligent men, denoting thereby their aspirations after \"pu-ti\" (Sanscrit, \"boddhi\") intelligence; the Reason or Logos of the Rationalists, denoting an emanation, the unknown factor or principle of nature, the way it acts in matter and mind; to lead; to direct, to follow out; to go in a designated path; to speak, to talk, to converse; as a \"preposition\", by, from; the way or cause a thing comes; a classifier of courses at a feast, edicts and dispatches, gateways, walls, rivers, bridges, &c.; a coating, a layer. (1874: 867)\n\nThe entry's 39 word and usage examples—which use Morrison's \"|\" abbreviation for the head character 道—include common expressions (\"bùzhīdào\" 不知道 \"I don't know\", \"dàolù\" 道路 \"a way; a road\"), Chinese Christian expressions (\"zìgǔdào\" 自古道 \"as saith the proverb\"), Chinese Buddhist terms (\"dédào\" 得道 \"to become perfect and enter \"nirvana\"; used by Budhists \"), and literary set phrases (\"Dàoxīn wéi wēi\" 道心惟微 \"the principle of right in the heart is small\" comes from the \"Book of Documents\" contrasting the 人心 \"human heart-mind\" and the 道心 \"Way's heart-mind\": \"The mind of man is restless, prone (to err); its affinity to what is right is small\", tr. Legge).\n\nScholars have both praised and criticized Williams’s dictionary. One of the first reviewers did both. Willem Pieter Groeneveldt praises Williams for \"surpassing all those before him, he has given us a dictionary better than any existing before\" and advises every student of Chinese to buy this \"great boon to sinology\" (1874: 226, 232); and yet he criticizes Williams for including \"fanciful\" etymological definitions based on character components instead of scientific philology, the \"indiscriminate introduction of the colloquial element\", and presenting yet another new system of romanization (1874: 228, 229, 232).\n\nThe American missionary Henry Blodget's 1874 review in the \"New York Observer\" says, \"this Dictionary, as a whole, is a treasury of knowledge in regard to China and Chinese affairs, a treasury accumulated by many years of study both of Protestant and Roman Catholic missionaries\" (Williams 1889: 399).\n\nThe British consular officer and linguist Herbert Giles published a 40-page brochure \"On some Translations and Mistranslations in Dr. Williams’ Syllabic Dictionary\", saying that it is \"though in many ways an improvement upon its predecessors, is still unlikely to hold the fort for any indefinitely long period\" (1879: 1). As an example, for Williams' translation of \"zhúfūrén\" 竹夫人 as \"A long bamboo pillow\", Giles gives, \"Literally, a bamboo wife. A hollow cylindrical leg-rest, made of bamboo. Commonly known to Europeans as a 'Dutch wife'\" (1879: 7). However, Williams did not reply to Giles’ challenges, but consistently reprinted his dictionary until 1909 (Yang 2014: 317). Giles criticized Williams as \"the lexicographer not for the future but of the past\", and took nearly twenty years to compile his (1892) \"A Chinese-English Dictionary\" (Wilkinson 2013: 85).\n\nCensuring Williams' dictionary for transliterating pronunciation from a \"general average\" of regional variants rather than Peking pronunciation, James Acheson wrote an index arranged according to Thomas Francis Wade's orthography, citing the frustration that many dictionary users who after \"repeated failures to find the commonest characters without reference to the radical index or, failing here as often happens, to the List of Difficult Characters\" (1879: 1).\n\nThe American sinologist Jerry Norman (1988: 173) credits Williams' \"A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language\" as apparently the first dictionary to properly distinguish between aspirated and unaspirated stops.\n\nA recent book on Chinese lexicography (Yong and Peng 2008: 387) says Williams' \"Syllabic Dictionary\" was the first dictionary of its kind to contain pronunciations from four regional varieties of Chinese: Pekingese, Cantonese, Xiamenese, and Shanghainese.\n\n\n"}

The center is named after Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of \"Vogue\", artistic director of Condé Nast, and chair of the museum's annual Met Gala (often called the \"Met Ball\") since 1995. It was endowed by Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch. As of August 2017, the curator is Andrew Bolton.\n\nThe center was formally opened by the First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama on May 5, 2014. Many famous people, such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Diane Von Furstenberg, Tory Burch, Zac Posen, Ralph Lauren, and Donatella Versace, were at the center's opening.\n\nIn 1902, Irene and Alice Lewisohn became teenage heiresses and decided to join other wealthy New York friends in community work. They began to spend time at the Henry Street Settlement House in New York, a community center devoted to the integration of immigrant families and since 1909 host to summer camps for girls and boys from underprivileged New York families. Alice, who acted in plays herself, began working as a drama teacher, while Irene devoted herself to dance productions. While at the Settlement House they also began to present performances and in 1915, the sisters joined Rita Wallach Morgenthau to build and found the Neighborhood Playhouse on the corner of Grand and Pitt Streets, where between 1915 and 1927, the theater presented plays by Shaw, Joyce, and Dunsany. Now called the Abrons Arts Center, the theater continues to showcase many Settlement arts programs. Aline Bernstein served her apprenticeship there from 1915-1924 designing costumes and stage sets. From 1928 the four women moved their operations to the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre at 340 East 54th Street. There it became an actor training school and students were offered a two-year program formal drama and dance training to become professionals. Both Gregory Peck and Anna Sokolow were students of Martha Graham there.\n\nDuring their years of running the school theatre and producing plays, a body of knowledge was formed about acting, theater production, and costume, set and stage design. Eventually Irene opened a home for her library called the Museum of Costume Art on Fifth Avenue in 1937. Aline Bernstein helped her with the collection and presentation. After the war in 1946 it moved to the first floor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and in 1960 the two organizations merged, and the Met is now home to the Irene Lewisohn Costume Reference Library.\n\nSince 1946, with help from the fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert, the institute has hosted the annual Met Gala, to raise money for operating expenses.\n\nIn 2008, the American Costume Collection of the Brooklyn Museum merged into the Costume Institute, a cost-saving scheme coming after years of close collaboration between the two organizations. The collection of the Brooklyn museum is older, having been formed from private donations by former New York high society personalities, beginning with the donation in 1903 of an 1892 cream crepe dress worn by Kate Mallory Williams at her graduation from Brooklyn Heights Seminary. Prior to the move, 23,500 objects from the Brooklyn collection were digitized and these images are now shared by both organizations. At the time of the merger, the Met costume collection consisted of 31,000 objects from the 17th-century onwards. The opening exhibition in 2014 featured work by British-born designer Charles James, an important figure in New York fashion of the 1940s and 1950s and whose work is in the Brooklyn collection.\nOn September 8, 2015, it was announced that Harold Koda would be stepping down from his position as Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute. Andrew Bolton, who had joined the Costume Institute in 2002 as associate curator and was made curator in 2006, was announced as his replacement.\n\nIn May 2017, the Costume Institute featured an exhibition featuring the works of Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons.

{"id": "290310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=290310", "title": "Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia", "text": "Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia\n\nThe Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) (, \"Hayasdani Azadakrut'ean Hay Kaghdni Panag, HAHKP\") was an Armenian militant organization, that operated from 1975 to the early 1990s. It was described as a terrorist organization by some sources, and as a guerrilla and armed organization by others. ASALA was listed as a terrorist organization by the United States in the 1980s. ASALA attacks and assassinations resulted in the deaths of 46 people and 299 injured.\n\nThe stated intention of ASALA was \"to compel the Turkish Government to acknowledge publicly its responsibility for the Armenian Genocide in 1915, pay reparations, and cede territory for an Armenian homeland\". The principal goal of ASALA was to establish a United Armenia (or \"Greater Armenia\") that would include the six vilayets of the Ottoman Empire (Western Armenia) and Soviet Armenia. Though the Treaty of Sèvres was never ratified, the group sought to claim the area (called \"Wilsonian Armenia\") that was promised to the Armenians by American President Woodrow Wilson in the 1920 agreement.\n\nThe group received considerable clandestine support from the Armenian diaspora in Europe and in the United States. Suffering from internal schisms, the group was relatively inactive in the 1990s, although in 1991 it claimed an unsuccessful attack on the Turkish ambassador to Hungary. The organization has not engaged in militant activity since then. The group's mottos were \"The armed struggle and right political line are the way to Armenia\" and \"\"Viva\" the revolutionary solidarity of oppressed people!\".\n\n100 years had passed since the Ottoman Empire had embarked on the campaign to exterminate its Armenian population, which was largely concentrated in its eastern provinces, referred to at the time as Western Armenia. The survivors of the massacres and deprivations commonly seen in the death marches found refuge in other countries in Western Asia, as well as in Western Europe and North America. While the key ringleaders of the genocide were assassinated in the 1920s by Armenians (\"see Operation Nemesis\"), the Ottoman Empire's successor, the Republic of Turkey, stated that a genocide had not taken place. It actively campaigned against any and all attempts to publicise the events and bring about recognition in the West. It blamed Armenians for instigating the violence and alleged that Armenians had massacred thousands of Turks, prompting the commencement of their deportations. In 1965, Armenians around the world publicly marked the 50th anniversary and began to campaign for world recognition. As peaceful marches and demonstrations failed to move an intransigent Turkey, the younger generation of Armenians, resentful at the denial by Turkey and the failure by their parents' generation to effect change, sought new approaches to bringing about recognition and reparations.\n\nIn 1973, two Turkish diplomats were assassinated in Los Angeles by Kourken Yanigian, an elderly man who survived the Armenian Genocide. This event might have been forgotten had it not initiated a chain of events which turned it, and its perpetrator, into a symbol representing the end of the conspiracy of silence which since 1915 had surrounded the Armenian Genocide. ASALA was founded in 1975 in Beirut, Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War by Hagop Hagopian (Harutiun Tagushian), pastor Reverend James Karnusian and Kevork Ajemian, a prominent contemporary writer, with the help of sympathetic Palestinians. At the beginning, ASALA bore the name of \"The Prisoner Kurken Yanikian Group\". Consisting primarily of Lebanese-born Armenians of the Diaspora (whose parents and/or grandparents were survivors of the genocide), the organization followed a theoretical model based on leftist ideology. ASALA was critical of its political predecessors and Diasporan parties, accusing them of failing to deal with the problems of the Armenian people. The apex of the group's structure was the General Command of the People of Armenia (\"VAN\").\n\nThe group's activities were primarily assassinations of Turkish diplomats and politicians in Western Europe, the United States and Western Asia. Their first acknowledged killing was the assassination of the Turkish diplomat, Daniş Tunalıgil, in Vienna on October 22, 1975. A failed attack in Geneva on October 3, 1980, in which two Armenian militants were injured resulted in a new nickname for the group, the 3 October Organization. ASALA's eight-point manifesto was published in 1981.\n\nASALA, trained in the Beirut camps of the Palestine Liberation Organization, is the best known of the guerrilla groups responsible for assassinations of at least 36 Turkish diplomats. Since 1975, a couple of dozen Turkish diplomats or members of their families had been targeted in a couple of dozens of attacks, with the outcome that the Armenian vengeance, as well as the background to the Armenian struggle, have made it to the world press. These notable acts, while carried out by a small group, were successful in conveying the Armenian Genocide to the forefront of international awareness.\n\n\nHistorian Fatma Göçek describes the stated aims of ASALA as \"righteous\" but the means sought for these aims, i.e. the \"wilful murder [of] innocent people\" as not righteous, and thus argues that it was a terrorist organisation.\n\nAccording to the MIPT website, there had been 84 incidents involving ASALA leaving 46 dead and 299 injured, including the following:\n\nOn October 22, 1975, Turkish Ambassador in Austria, Danis Tunaligil was assassinated by three members of ASALA. Two days later, the Turkish Ambassador in France, Ismail Erez and his chauffeur were killed. Both ASALA and JCAG claimed responsibility.\n\nThe first two ASALA militants, arrested on October 3, 1980, were Alex Yenikomshian and Suzy Mahserejian, who were wounded after the accidental explosion of a bomb in a hotel in Geneva.\n\nDuring the 1981 Turkish consulate attack in Paris (\"Van operation\") ASALA militants held 56 hostages for fifteen hours; it became the first operation of its kind. Militants demanded release of political prisoners in Turkey including two Armenian clergymen, 5 Turks and 5 Kurds. Coverage of the takeover received one of the highest television ratings in France in 1981. Among those who supported the militants during the trial were Henri Verneuil, Mélinée Manouchian, the widow of the French resistance hero, Missak Manouchian, and singer Liz Sarian.\n\nOne of the most known attacks of ASALA was Esenboga airport attack on August 7, 1982 in Ankara, when its members targeted non-diplomat civilians for the first time. Two militants opened fire in a crowded passenger waiting room. One of the shooters took more than 20 hostages while the second was apprehended by police. Altogether, nine people died and 82 were injured. The arrested militant Levon Ekmekjian condemned the attack in its aftermath and appealed to other members of ASALA to stop the violence.\n\nOn August 10, 1982, Artin Penik a Turk of Armenian descent, set himself on fire in protest of this attack.\n\nOn July 15, 1983, ASALA carried out another attack at the Orly Airport near Paris, in which 8 people were killed, most of them not being Turks. The attack resulted in a split in ASALA, between those individuals who carried it out, and those who believed the attack to be counterproductive.\nThe split resulted in emergence of two groups, the \"ASALA-Militant\" led by Hagopian and the 'Revolutionary Movement' (\"ASALA-Mouvement Révolutionnaire\") led by Monte Melkonian. While Melkonian's faction insisted on attacks strictly against Turkish officials and the Turkish government, Hagopian's group disregarded the losses of unintended victims and regularly executed dissenting members.\n\nAfterwards, French forces promptly arrested those involved. Moreover, this attack eliminated the suspected secret agreement that the French socialist government made with ASALA, in which the government would allow ASALA to use France as a base of operations in exchange for refraining from launching attacks on French soil. Belief in this suspected agreement was further bolstered after \"Interior Minister Gaston Defferre called [ASALA's] cause \"just\", and four Armenians arrested for taking hostages at the Turkish Embassy in September 1981 were given light sentences.\"\n\nContinuous attacks by ASALA prompted Turkey to accuse Cyprus, Greece, Syria, Lebanon, and the Soviet Union of provoking or possibly funding ASALA. Although they publicly distanced themselves from ASALA, Turkey's Armenian community came under attack by Turkish nationalists in reaction to the group's actions. This became apparent after the assassination of Ahmet Benler on October 12, 1979 by Armenian militants in the Hague. The reaction to the attack led to the bombing of the church of the Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate in Istanbul on October 19 in retaliation. In 1980, the Turkish government arrested Armenian priest Fr. Manuel Yergatian at the Istanbul airport for the alleged possession of maps that indicated Armenian territory within modern-day Turkey and was sentenced to 14 years in prison for possible ties with ASALA. Amnesty International adopted him as a prisoner of conscience, concluding that the evidence against him was baseless. According to Tessa Hofmann, Turkish officials frequently used the accusation of collaboration with ASALA and foreign Armenian circles to incriminate extreme left-wing Turkish opposition groups.\n\nIn April 2000 the opening ceremony of \"In Memory of killed ASALA commandos\" monument took place at Armenian military pantheon Yerablur with participation of Greek anti-fascist resistance leader Manolis Glezos and other special guests. \n\nAfter the ASALA attack against the Esenboğa International Airport in August 1982 the then President of Turkey Kenan Evren issued a decree for the elimination of ASALA. The task was given to the National Intelligence Organization's Foreign Operations Department. Evren's own daughter, a member of the MİT, ran the operation together with Foreign Intelligence Department chief Metin (Mete) Günyol, and Istanbul region director Nuri Gündeş.\n\nLevon Ekmekjian was captured and placed in Ankara's Mamak Prison. He was told that he had to choose between confessing and being executed. After being promised that his comrades would not be harmed, he revealed how ASALA worked to a team led by MİT's Presidential Liaison and Evren's son-in-law, Erkan Gürvit. He was tried by Ankara martial law command military court, and sentenced to death. His appeal of the sentence was declined, and he was hanged on 29 January 1983.\n\nIn the early spring of 1983 two teams were sent to France and Lebanon. Günyol tapped contract killer Abdullah Çatlı, who had just finished serving a prison sentence in Switzerland for drug trafficking, to lead the French contingent. Günyol says he did not reveal his identity to Çatlı, who referred to him as \"Colonel\", thinking Günyol used to be a soldier.\n\nA second French unit was assembled under MİT operative Sabah Ketene. The Lebanese contingent, consisting only of MİT operatives and members of the \"Special Warfare Department\" (special forces), was led by MİT officer Hiram Abas.\n\nThe bomb that Çatlı's team had planted in Ara Toranyan's car on 22 March 1983 did not explode. A follow-up attempt also failed. Toranyan said they had planted the bomb in the wrong car. Likewise, Henri Papazyan's car bomb on 1 May 1984 did not explode. Çatlı claimed credit for killing Hagop Hagopian, however he was in a French prison (again, on narcotics charges) at the time of the attack. Papazyan is now believed to have been killed as a result of infighting. The second French team (led by Ketene) did carry out some attacks (which Çatlı also claimed credit for), such as the 1984 Alfortville monument and Salle Pleyel concert room attacks. It is unknown whether the Lebanese contingent did anything at all.\n\nWith the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 the group lost much of its organization and support. Sympathetic Palestinian organizations including the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) withdrew their support and passed materials to the French intelligence services in 1983, detailing ASALA operatives. The last attack, on 19 December 1991, targeted the bullet-proof limousine carrying the Turkish Ambassador to Budapest. The ambassador was not injured in the attack, which was claimed by ASALA in Paris.\n\nASALA's founder Hagop Hagopian was assassinated on a sidewalk in an affluent neighborhood in Athens, Greece on April 28, 1988. He was shot several times while he was walking with two women at 4:30 in the morning. Veteran member Hagop Tarakchian died of cancer in 1980. Assassinations of former members of ASALA-RM continued in Armenia into the late 1990s.\n\nAccording to Turkish National Intelligence Organization official Nuri Gündeş, ASALA was dissolved after the assassination of Hagopian. According to Turkish sources, another reason is that financial backing was withdrawn by the Armenian diaspora after the 1983 Orly Airport attack.\n\nSince the 1970s the ASALA Information Branch published books, booklets, posters and other promotional materials. \"Hayasdan\" ('Armenia') was the official multi-lingual organ of ASALA published in 1980–1987 and 1991–1997. The first issue was published in October 1980 and contained 40 pages. The place of publication and names of contributors are not known. It was published monthly, sometimes with united volumes. The main language was Armenian. From 1983 to 1987 it had separate issues in Arabic, English, French and Turkish. The journal published editorials, official announcements of ASALA, and articles on political and military issues. \"Hayasdan\" was distributed free of charge in Armenian communities.\n\nThe journal's mottos were \"The armed struggle and right political line are the way to Armenia\" and \"Viva the revolutionary solidarity of oppressed people!\" It had sister publications including left-wing \"Hayasdan Gaydzer\" (London) and \"Hayasdan – Hay Baykar\" (Paris) which used \"Hayasdan\" in their titles since 1980. Both were published by the Popular Movements which worked towards mobilising support among Armenians for a political movement focused on ASALA.\n\n\n"}

The majority of these manuscripts were from Árni’s native Iceland, but he also acquired many important Norwegian, Danish and Swedish manuscripts, as well as a number of other, chiefly continental, provenance. After being housed since Árni's death at the University of Copenhagen, in the Arnamagnæan Institute, under a 1965 parliamentary ruling the collection is now divided between there and the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies in Reykjavík, Iceland.\n\nWhen Árni died in 1730 he bequeathed his collection to the University of Copenhagen, whereupon it became part of the University Library. The collection has been augmented over the years through individual purchases and gifts and the acquisition of a number of smaller collections, for example that of the Danish grammarian Rasmus Rask, bringing the total number of items to around 3000. In 1956 the Arnamagnæan Institute (, now \"Den Arnamagnæanske Samling\", The Arnamagnæan Collection) was established to care for and further the study of the manuscripts in the collection.\n\nEven before its constitutional separation from Denmark in 1944, Iceland had begun to petition for the return of these manuscripts. After much heated debate, the Danish parliament decided in May 1965 that such documents in the Arnamagnæan Collection as might be held to be \"Icelandic cultural property\" (\"islandsk kultureje\") — broadly defined as a work composed or translated by an Icelander and whose content is wholly or chiefly concerned with Iceland — were to be transferred to the newly established Icelandic Manuscript Institute (now the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies, ), a part of the University of Iceland. It further provided for the transfer from the Danish Royal Library (\"Det kongelige Bibliotek\") of manuscripts belonging to the same categories as the manuscripts relinquished by the Arnamagnæan Institute, and contained a special clause relating to the transfer to Iceland of two manuscripts, the Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda and the vellum codex Flateyjarbók, both of which were in the Royal Library (and would not have been deemed \"islandsk kultureje\" under the terms of the treaty). These were handed over to Iceland in a ceremony held immediately after the ratification of the treaty in 1971. The first consignment of manuscripts was dispatched from Copenhagen to Reykjavík in June 1973 and the last two were handed over in June 1997. Altogether a total of 1,666 manuscripts, and all the Icelandic charters and apographa, have been transferred to Iceland, slightly over half the collection, in addition to 141 manuscripts from the Royal Library. Of the manuscripts remaining in Copenhagen about half are Icelandic but have as their chief concern matters not directly related to Iceland, e.g. the histories of the kings of Norway and Denmark, religious texts or translations from Latin and other languages.\n\nIn 2009 the Arnamagnæan Manuscript Collection was added to UNESCO’s Memory of the World Register in recognition of its historical value.\n\n"}

{"id": "11010786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11010786", "title": "Cabinet card", "text": "Cabinet card\n\nThe cabinet card was a style of photograph which was widely used for photographic portraiture after 1870. It consisted of a thin photograph mounted on a card typically measuring 108 by 165 mm ( by inches).\n\nThe \"carte de visite\" was displaced by the larger cabinet card in the 1880s. In the early 1860s, both types of photographs were essentially the same in process and design. Both were most often albumen prints, the primary difference being the cabinet card was larger and usually included extensive logos and information on the reverse side of the card to advertise the photographer’s services. However, later into its popularity, other types of papers began to replace the albumen process. Despite the similarity, the cabinet card format was initially used for landscape views before it was adopted for portraiture.\n\nSome cabinet card images from the 1890s have the appearance of a black-and-white photograph in contrast to the distinctive sepia toning notable in the albumen print process. These photographs have a neutral image tone and were most likely produced on a matte collodion, gelatin or gelatin bromide paper.\n\nSometimes images from this period can be identified by a greenish cast. Gelatin papers were introduced in the 1870s and started gaining acceptance in the 1880s and 1890s as the gelatin bromide papers became popular. Matte collodion was used in the same period. A true black-and-white image on a cabinet card is likely to have been produced in the 1890s or after 1900. The last cabinet cards were produced in the 1920s, even as late as 1924.\n\nOwing to the larger image size, the cabinet card steadily increased in popularity during the second half of the 1860s and into the 1870s, replacing the \"carte de visite\" as the most popular form of portraiture. The cabinet card was large enough to be easily viewed from across the room when typically displayed on a cabinet, which is probably why they became known as such in the vernacular. However, when the renowned Civil War photographer Mathew Brady first started offering them to his clientele towards the end of 1865, he used the trademark \"Imperial Carte-de-Visite.\" Whatever the name, the popular print format joined the photograph album as a fixture in the late 19th-century Victorian parlor.\n\nEarly in its introduction, the cabinet card ushered in the temporary disuse of the photographic album which had come into existence commercially with the \"carte de visite\". Photographers began employing artists to retouch photographs by altering the negative before making the print to hide facial defects revealed by the new format. Small stands and photograph frames for the table top replaced the heavy photograph album. Photo album manufacturers responded by producing albums with pages primarily for cabinet cards with a few pages in the back reserved for the old family \"carte de visite\" prints.\n\nFor nearly three decades after the 1860s, the commercial portraiture industry was dominated by the \"carte de visite\" and cabinet card formats. In the decade before 1900, the number and variety of card photograph styles expanded in response to declining sales. Manufacturers of standardized card stock and print materials hoped to stimulate sales and retain public interest in card photographs. However, the public increasingly demanded outdoor and candid photographs with enlarged prints which they could frame or smaller unmounted snapshots they could collect in scrapbooks.\n\nOwing in part to the immense popularity of the affordable Kodak Box Brownie camera, first introduced in 1900, the public increasingly began taking their own photographs, and thus the popularity of the cabinet card declined.\n\n\nWhen attempting to determine the date of creation for a cabinet card, clues can be gathered by the details on the card. The type of card stock or whether it had right-angled or rounded corners can often help to determine the date of the photograph to as close as five years. However, it has to be noted that these dating methods aren't always 100% accurate, since a Victorian photographer may have been using up old card stock, or the cabinet card may have been a re-print made many years after the photo was originally recorded.\n\nCard stock\n\n\nCard colours\n\n\nBorders\n\n\nLettering\n\n\n"}

{"id": "273632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=273632", "title": "Christian left", "text": "Christian left\n\nThe term Christian left refers to a spectrum of centre-left and left-wing Christian political and social movements that largely embrace viewpoints described as social justice and uphold a social gospel. Given the inherent diversity in international political thought, the term can have different meanings and applications in different countries. Although there is some overlap, the Christian left is distinct from liberal Christianity, meaning not all Christian leftists are liberal Christians, and vice versa. Some Christian leftists also have socially conservative views on some social issues while left-leaning on some economic issues.\n\nAs with any section within the left and right wings of a political spectrum, a label such as \"Christian left\" represents an approximation, including within it groups and persons holding many diverse viewpoints. The term left-wing might encompass a number of values, some of which may or may not be held by different Christian movements and individuals.\n\nAs the unofficial title of a loose association of believers, it does provide a clear distinction from the more commonly known \"Christian right\" or \"religious right\" and from its key leaders and political views.\n\nThe most common religious viewpoint that might be described as \"left-wing\" is social justice, or care for impoverished and oppressed groups. Supporters of this trend might encourage universal health care, welfare provisions, subsidized education, foreign aid, and affirmative action for improving the conditions of the disadvantaged. With values stemming from egalitarianism, adherents of the Christian left consider it part of their religious duty to take actions on behalf of the oppressed. As nearly all major religions contain some kind of requirement to help others, various religions have cited social justice as a movement in line with their faith.\n\nThe Christian left holds that social justice, renunciation of power, humility, forgiveness, and private observation of prayer (as opposed to publicly mandated prayer), are mandated by the Gospel (Matthew 6:5-6). The Bible contains accounts of Jesus repeatedly advocating for the poor and outcast over the wealthy, powerful, and religious. The Christian left maintains that such a stance is relevant and important. Adhering to the standard of \"turning the other cheek\", which they believe supersedes the Old Testament law of \"an eye for an eye\", the Christian left often hearkens towards pacifism in opposition to policies advancing militarism.\n\nSome among the Christian left, as well as some non-religious socialists, find support for socialism in the Gospels (for example Mikhail Gorbachev citing Jesus as \"the first socialist\"). The Christian left is a broad category that includes Christian socialism, while also including non-socialists as well.\n\nFor much of the early history of anti-establishment leftist movements such as socialism and communism (which was highly anti-clerical in the 19th century), some established churches were led by clergy who saw revolution as a threat to their status and power. The church was sometimes seen as part of the establishment. Revolutions in America, France, Russia and (much later) Spain were in part directed against the established churches (or rather their leading clergy) and instituted a separation of church and state.\n\nHowever, in the 19th century some writers and activists developed a school of thought, Christian socialism, a branch of Christian thought that was infused with socialism.\n\nEarly socialist thinkers such as Robert Owen, Henri de Saint-Simon based their theories of socialism upon Christian principles. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels reacted against these theories by formulating a secular theory of socialism in \"The Communist Manifesto\".\n\nStarting in the late 19th century and early 20th century, some began to take on the view that genuine Christianity had much in common with a leftist perspective. From St. Augustine of Hippo's \"City of God\" through St. Thomas More's \"Utopia\", major Christian writers had expounded upon views that socialists found agreeable. Of major interest was the extremely strong thread of egalitarianism in the New Testament. Other common leftist concerns such as pacifism, social justice, racial equality, human rights, and the rejection of excessive wealth are also expressed strongly in the Bible. In the late 19th century, the Social Gospel movement arose (particularly among some Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Baptists in North America and Britain,) which attempted to integrate progressive and socialist thought with Christianity to produce a faith-based social activism, promoted by movements such as Christian socialism. In the United States during this period, Episcopalians and Congregationalists generally tended to be the most liberal, both in theological interpretation and in their adherence to the Social Gospel. In Canada, a coalition of liberal Congregationalists, Methodists, and Presbyterians founded the United Church of Canada, one of the first true Christian left denominations. Later in the 20th century, liberation theology was championed by such writers as Gustavo Gutierrez and Matthew Fox.\n\nTo a significant degree, the Christian left developed out of the experiences of clergy who went to do pastoral work among the working class, often beginning without any social philosophy but simply a pastoral and evangelistic concern for workers. This was particularly true among the Methodists and Anglo-Catholics in England, Father Adolph Kolping in Germany and Joseph Cardijn in Belgium.\n\nSome Christian groups were closely associated with the peace movements against the Vietnam War as well as the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Religious leaders in many countries have also been on the forefront of criticizing any cuts to social welfare programs. In addition, many prominent civil rights activists (such as Martin Luther King, Jr.) were religious figures.\n\nIn the United States, members of the Christian Left come from a spectrum of denominations: Peace churches, elements of the Protestant mainline churches, Catholicism, and some evangelicals.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2004 election in the United States, progressive Christian leaders started to form groups of their own to combat the religious right. Such groups include the Center for Progressive Christianity (founded 1996) and the Christian Alliance for Progress.\n\nThe Christian left generally approaches homosexuality differently from other Christian political groups. This approach can be driven by focusing on issues differently despite holding similar religious views, or by holding different religious ideas. Those in the Christian left who have similar ideas as other Christian political groups but a different focus may view Christian teachings on certain issues, such as the Bible's prohibitions against killing or criticisms of concentrations of wealth, as far more politically important than Christian teachings on social issues emphasized by the religious right, such as opposition to homosexuality. Others in the Christian left have not only a different focus on issues from other Christian political groups, but different religious ideas as well.\n\nFor example, all members of the Christian left consider discrimination and bigotry against homosexuals to be immoral, but they differ on their views towards homosexual sex. Some believe homosexual sex to be immoral but largely unimportant when compared with issues relating to social justice, or even matters of sexual morality involving heterosexual sex. Others affirm that some homosexual practices are compatible with the Christian life. Such members believe common biblical arguments used to condemn homosexuality are misinterpreted, and that biblical prohibitions of homosexual practices are actually against a specific type of homosexual sex act, i.e. pederasty, the sodomizing of young boys by older men. Thus, they hold biblical prohibitions to be irrelevant when considering modern same-sex relationships.\n\nA related strain of thought is the (Catholic and progressive evangelical) consistent life ethic, which sees opposition to capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, abortion and the global unequal distribution of wealth as being related. It is an idea with certain concepts shared by Abrahamic religions as well as Buddhists, Hindus, and members of other religions. The late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago developed the idea for the consistent life ethic in 1983. Currently, Sojourners is particularly associated with this strand of thought. Adherents commonly criticize politicians who identify as pro-life while simultaneously oppose funding for pre-natal vitamins, child nutrition programs, or universal health care.\n\nLiberation theology is a theological tradition that emerged in the developing world, especially Latin America. Since the 1960s, Catholic thinkers have integrated left-wing thought and Catholicism, giving rise to Liberation Theology. It arose at a time when Catholic thinkers who opposed the despotic leaders in South and Central America allied themselves with the communist opposition. However, it developed independently of and roughly simultaneously with Black theology in the U.S. and should not be confused with it. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith decided that while liberation theology is partially compatible with Catholic social teaching, certain Marxist elements of it, such as the doctrine of perpetual class struggle, are against Church teachings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe medieval Lollards, particularly John Ball, took up many anti-establishment causes. During the English Civil War many of the more radical Parliamentarians, such as John Lilburne and the Levellers, based their belief in universal suffrage and proto-socialism on their reading of the Bible. Other people on the Christian left include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of movements of the past had similarities to today's Christian left:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3545953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3545953", "title": "Dongui Bogam", "text": "Dongui Bogam\n\nThe Dongui Bogam (동의보감) is a Korean book compiled by the royal physician, Heo Jun (1539 – 1615) and was first published in 1613 during the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. The title literally means “a priceless book about medicines of an Eastern Country”. The word \"Eastern\" is not the antonym to the Western World's 'Western', but Heo Jun gave the book such a name because Eastern Country was one of the sobriquets of Korea. The book is regarded as important in traditional Korean medicine, and is one of the classics of Oriental medicine today. As of July 2009, it is on UNESCO’s Memory of the World Programme. The original edition of Dongui Bogam is currently preserved by the Korean National Library. The original was written in Hanja and only part of it was transcribed in Korean for wide reading use, as only officials understood in Hanmun. It was translated to English in 2013. \n\nKnown as one of the classics in the history of Eastern medicine, it was published and used in many countries including China and Japan, and\nremains a key reference work for the study of Eastern medicine. Its categorization and ordering of symptoms and remedies under the different\nhuman organs affected, rather than the disease itself, was a revolutionary development at that time. It contains insights that in some cases did not enter the medical knowledge of Europe until the twentieth century.\n\nWork on the \"Dongui Bogam\" started in the 29th year of King Seonjo’s reign (1596) by the main physicians of \"Naeuiwon\" (내의원, “royal clinic”), with the objective to create a thorough compilation of traditional medicine. Main physician Heo Jun led the project but work was interrupted due to the second Japanese invasion of Korea in 1597. King Seonjo did not see the project come to fruition, but Heo Jun steadfastedly stuck to the project and finally completed the work in 1610, the 2nd year of King Gwanghaegun’s reign.\n\nThe \"Dongui Bogam\" consists of 25 volumes. In contrast to \"Hyangyak jipseongbang\" (향약집성방, \"Compilation of Native Korean Prescriptions\"), written in 1433, \"Dongui Bogam\" is more systematic. It not only refers to Korean medicinal texts, but also Chinese medicinal texts, and records illnesses practically with their respective remedies.\n\nThe book is divided into 5 chapters: \"Naegyeongpyeon\" (내경편, 内景篇, Internal Medicine), \"Oehyeongpyeon\" (외형편, 外形篇, External Medicine), \"Japbyeongpyeon\" (잡병편, 難病編, Miscellaneous Diseases), \"Tangaekpyeon\" (탕액편, 湯液編, Remedies), and \"Chimgupyeon\" (침구편, 鍼灸編, Acupuncture).\n\n\"Dongui Bogam\" offered not only medical facts, but also philosophical values of Eastern Asia. Heo Jun conveyed the message that maintaining the body’s energies in balance leads to one’s good health. The first page of the book is an anatomical map of the human body, linking human body with heaven and earth which embodies the Asian perspective of nature.\n\nThere have been several print editions of \"Dongui Bogam\" besides the original \"Naeuiwon\" edition, within Korea and abroad. The first Chinese edition was printed in 1763 with additional prints in 1796, and 1890. The Japanese edition was first printed in 1724, and then 1799.\n\nIn 2009, UNESCO decided to add \"Dongui Bogam\" to the cultural heritage list due to its contribution as a historical relic and it was placed on UNESCO’s Memory of the World Programme, becoming Korea's seventh cultural heritage to be thus included. However, doctors clashed over \"Dongui Bogam\" after the official listing. The Korean Medical Association (KMA) downplayed the book’s importance saying that “it shouldn’t be taken as anything more than a recognition of the book’s value as a historical relic. It should not be taken as an acknowledgement of traditional medicine for its superior effectiveness” Listing the fact that the book is full of quackery such as how to bear a son or how to make yourself invisible. The KMA emphasized that \"Dongui Bogam\" was merely a cultural artifact and not science. The Association of Korean Oriental Medicine (AKOM) criticized the doctors of KMA for the lack of their appreciation of the influence of \"Dongui Bogam\" and history, saying it is necessary “to inherit and advance traditional medicine”.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52809781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52809781", "title": "Golan Regiment", "text": "Golan Regiment\n\nThe Golan Regiment (Arabic: فوج الجولان, Fouj al-Joulan) is a militia based in Khan Arnabah that is part of the National Defence Forces (NDF). Though primarily active in the Golan Heights, the unit has been deployed in various warzones of western Syria, fighting against many different Syrian opposition forces and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The Golan Regiment is notable insofar as it was the first government unit during the Syrian Civil War that was founded by Free Syrian Army (FSA) defectors.\n\nThe beginnings of the Golan Regiment trace back to 2011, when its later leader Majid Himoud volunteered for the Syrian Army. According to Himoud, the officers in his division abused him and other soldiers, whereupon they decided to defect. In December 2011, they formed a Free Syrian Army unit under Himoud's leadership, the al-Mutasim Battalion, and began to fight against the government near the border to Israel. Allied with other local rebel groups, Himoud's men fought at Jabata, Khan Arnabah, Madinat al-Baath, Beer Ajam, and Breika, and made good progress against the government. As time went on, however, Himoud became increasingly dissatisfied with his allies; he later claimed that some groups such as Alwiya al-Furqan \"wouldn’t even fight, they would come to the battlefield after the clashes had ended, take pictures and videos next to destroyed buildings and tanks, and then send them back to their financiers in Jordan or the Gulf states in order to collect their paychecks\". Others he accused of closely working with Israel, which he considered a \"red line\" Syrians should not cross.\n\nThese factors led Himoud and many of his men reconsider their role as rebels, and in late 2013 he eventually contacted the mayor of Khan Arnabah, who was his relative and the NDF commander whose troops he was primarily fighting. The two agreed to a local ceasefire, and after eight months of negotiations, Himoud and dozens of his fighters handed themselves over to the government. They received an amnesty by president Bashar al-Assad, and formed the \"Golan Regiment\" as National Defence Forces unit/Popular Committee, centered in Khan Arnabah. The al-Mutasim Battalion members who disagreed with Himoud's decision and refused to defect instead joined other rebel groups. Since its foundation, the Golan Regiment has grown by recruiting government loyalists into its ranks, for example from Hader, a mostly Druze town that is generally considered to be staunchly pro-Assad.\n\nIn course of the Quneitra offensive in June 2015, the Golan Regiment and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade first held two strategic significant hills against numerous rebel assaults, and then aided the Syrian Army in retaking Tal Hamr and lifting the siege of Hader. They consequently helped to fend off further attacks against Hader by the Southern Front and allied mujahideen. Throughout July, the Golan Regiment helped to defend several towns and hills in the Golan Heights against various Southern Front-led attacks, and participated in a major government counter-offensive in the area.\n\nIn September 2015, the regiment held reconciliation talks with Free Syrian Army (FSA) units that held Jabatha Al-Khasheb, Beit Jinn, and Taranjah, though in the end the talks failed and fighting was resumed. As result, FSA and al-Nusra Front fighters launched another offensive to capture Hader and the surrounding countryside, with the Golan Regiment once again attempting to hold its positions at the frontline.\n\nOn 2 October, the Islamist Jaish al-Haramoun alliance and several FSA units launched another offensive in Quneitra, first attacking Tall Ahmar, which was defended by the Golan Regiment and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade. After a fierce, two-days long battle, the hill fell into rebel hands and the NDF defenders were forced to withdraw. The Golan Regiment, along with other NDF and army units, launched a counter-attack to recapture Tall Ahmar on 7 October, which was repelled. Opposition troops then also took control of the nearby \"UN hill\", though NDF forces, including the Golan Regiment, reversed this rebel gain a few hours later. In course of the next weeks, the Golan Regiment helped to recapture all positions taken by rebel forces during the offensive.\n\nIn late December 2015, the Golan Regiment participated in a government attack on West Al-Samdaniyah, which was captured after hard fighting; soon after its capture, however, the army retreated from the town for unknown reasons, so that it was retaken by rebels.\n\nThe regiment and other government units once again held reconciliation talks with local FSA rebels in the following January. Later that month, the 9th Armoured Division's 90th Brigade and the Golan Regiment successfully ambushed an al-Nusra Front and Ahrar al-Sham convoy near the Shebaa farms. On 29 January, the Golan Regiment helped to repel renewed rebel attacks against the contested hill of Tal Kroum.\n\nBeginning with February 2016, when the unit sent its fighters north to participate in the first government offensive to retake ISIL-held Al-Tabqa Military Airport, the Golan Regiment became far more active outside of Quneitra Governorate. Though the aforementioned offensive eventually stalled and was discontinued, the Golan Regiment also aided the recapture of Palmyra from ISIL in March. Later in June, its militiamen were once again involved in another attempt by the government to regain Al-Tabqa Military Airport; which ended in a complete defeat as the pro-government forces were routed by ISIL counter-attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Golan Regiment continued its defence of the Hader area. On 6 June the Criterion Brigades launched an offensive called \"At Your Service Darayya\" in order to draw government forces from the Siege of Darayya and Muadamiyat to reinforce the front in Quneitra. The Brigades allegedly seized 2 villages, which was promptly denied by the Golan Regiment. On 28 July, the Israel Defense Forces attacked the Golan Regiment, launching missiles at the convoy of Majid Himoud and two mortar emplacements of the unit at Madinat al-Baath. While Himoud survived, the militia denounced Israel for its \"Zionist\" attacks.\n\nThe following September saw a resurgence in the fighting for the Golan Heights, as Jihadist-led rebels launched a large-scale offensive in the area, with the Golan Regiment once again at the forefront in the defense of Hader. Throughout the battle, the Golan Regiment accused Israel of supporting the Islamist rebels, and on 17 September, the unit once again became the target of an Israeli Air Force (IAF) strike that killed one and wounded 5 of its militiamen. The strike was in retaliation for a stray mortar shell that had hit Israeli territory. On the other side, the pro-opposition Al-Etihad accused the Golan Regiment of having disguised Hezbollah fighters in its ranks. While the rebel offensive was eventually repelled, a later government counter-offensive supported by the Golan Regiment equally yielded no gains. Meanwhile, after the Syrian Revolutionaries Front (SRF)'s branch in Jubata al-Khashab collapsed amid internal discord, the local SRF commander defected to the Golan Regiment.\n\nThe unit spearheaded a government attack in November 2016 that secured the northern part of a strategic highway in the Golan Heights. In December, the Golan Regiment sent reinforcements to the Tiyas Military Airbase in an attempt to halt a massive ISIL offensive in the region. On 17 and 26 January 2017, the regiment reportedly helped to repel two rebel attacks in the areas around Hader. On 19 March, the Israeli Air Force targeted the Golan Regiment commander Yasser Hussein al-Sayyed with a drone as he was travelling to Damascus by car. Both he as well as his driver were killed. The attack was seen as Israeli retaliation for the attempt of the Syrian Air Defense Force to shoot down an IAF jet that had bombarded Hezbollah positions near Palmyra. Meanwhile, the unit also helped countering rebel offensives in Jobar and northern Hama, and took part in the operations in the Syrian Desert in course of which the government again retook Palmyra and pushed back ISIL in eastern Homs Governorate.\n\nOn 16 June, a suicide bomber struck Majid Himoud as he was meeting with other Golan Regiment fighters in Khan Arnabah; two members of the unit were killed instantly, while Himoud was wounded and brought to a hospital. There he succumbed to his wounds two days later. He was replaced by Khaled Abaza as chief commander of the militia, while Yassin Salibi became the new head of the Golan Regiment's First Battalion. Later that month, the Golan Regiment aided the Syrian Army and other pro-government militias in repelling a major rebel offensive against Madinat al-Baath; in course of the fighting, the unit was once again bombed by the Israeli Air Force. The Golan Regiment helped to repel an Tahrir al-Sham-led attack on Hader in September 2017. In late 2017, the Golan Regiment relocated much of its forces from other regions of Syria to the Golan Heights in response to rumors about another rebel offensive.\n\nMeanwhile, disputes erupted among the Golan Regiment's leadership. After becoming the new leader of the militia, Khaled Abaza had grown increasingly powerful, having been appointed as head of Ba'ath Party's branch in Quneitra Governorate and effectively taking control of Khan Arnabah. He eventually tried to oust Yassin Salibi as leader of the First Battalion, but Yassin found the support of the Quneitra Hawks Brigade and the al-Bustan Association of pro-government businessman Rami Makhlouf, both of which were wary of Kaled's power. In consequence, the Golan Regiment's Fist Battalion and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade forces in Khan Arnabah, supported by the al-Bustan Association, merged to form the \"National Shield of the Patriotic Forces\" in December 2017. This new formation was about 1,500 strong and to be led by Mohammed al-Hajj. This development reduced Khaled's control to the Golan Regiment's Second and Third Battalion. The \"National Shield\" then took part in the Beit Jinn offensive. In March 2018, the Golan Regiment and the Quneitra Hawks Brigade occupied Point 99, a hill west of Beit Jinn, as result of the agreement between the government and rebel forces following the Beit Jinn offensive's conclusion.\n\nArtillery fire again struck Israeli territory during renwed clashes in Quneitra Governorate in July 2018, whereupon the Israeli military responded by bombarding areas in Al-A'ayyaz near Khan Arnabah that were controlled by the Golan Regiment.\n\nThe Golan Regiment is split into three parts: The \"First Battalion\" of Khan Arnabah, the \"Second Battalion\" of Hader, and the \"Third Battalion\" of Jaba. The founder of the militia, Majid Himoud, served as both chief commander and leader of the First Battalion before his death in June 2017. Thereafter, the militia's overall leader was Khaled Abaza, a Circassian from Beer Ajam and the son of Brigadier Walid Abaza who served as head of the Political Security Directorate's branch in Hama during the Islamist uprising in Syria. By late 2017, the battalions were led by Yassin Salibi (First), Abu Mashhour (Second), and Abu Suhaib (Third). Another notable officer in the Golan Regiment was Yasser Hussein al-Sayyed.\n\n\n"}

Ginzburg was a 1969 United States court ruling on defamation.\n\n\"Fact\" Magazine (\"Fact\") was a corporation in New York. The defendant, Ralph Ginzburg, was the editor and publisher of \"Fact\", and Warren Boroson, a co-defendant in this case, was the managing editor of \"Fact\". The plaintiff, Barry Goldwater, was a United States Senator from Arizona and had been a 1964 presidential candidate. The defendants testified that they attended the July 1964 Republican National Convention and were not impressed with Senator Goldwater. Thus, they decided to warn the American people in an issue of their magazine (soon known as the \"Goldwater issue\" of \"Fact\") immediately after Goldwater's nomination on July 16th. \n\nThe issue at hand was the article published by \"Fact\" titled \"The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater\" in the September-October 1964 issue. The magazine polled psychiatrists and asked if Goldwater was psychologically fit to serve as president. \"Fact\" used the information given from the polls in the magazine article against Senator Goldwater. Senator Goldwater sued \"Fact\" Magazine, Inc., Ginzburg, and Boroson for \"false, scandalous and defamatory statements referring to and concerning [the] plaintiff.” \n\nThe court found that the evidence introduced at trial proved the defendants knew they were publishing defamatory statements and “were motivated by actual malice when they published the statements.” The court found the defendants guilty of libel action based on the article \"Fact\" published. The plaintiff demanded $1,000,000 in compensatory and punitive damages but Senator Goldwater was awarded $1 in compensatory damages and $75,000 in punitive damages. The compensatory damages were against all defendants but the punitive damages were split between the defendants. Ginzburg and Boroson were liable for $25,000 of the $75,000 and \"Fact\" Magazine, Inc. was liable for $50,000. The United States Court of Appeals affirmed the award and the Supreme Court denied a petition for \"certiorari\" (review); Justice Black and Justice Douglas joined a dissenting opinion, rather unusual at the time (1970) on orders denying “cert.” Boroson was the only defendant not to file an appeal after receiving the ruling.\n\nAlthough over 1,800 psychiatrists responded to the polls sent by Ginzburg, the medical director at the time, Walter Barton, sent a protest warning Ginzburg that \"a psychiatrist’s evaluation must take place in the context of a doctor-patient relationship and a “thorough clinical examination\".\" The American Psychiatric Association then issued the Goldwater rule reaffirming medical privacy and forbidding commenting on a patient that any individual psychiatrist has not personally examined.\n"}
{"id": "45234439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45234439", "title": "Interference Archive", "text": "Interference Archive\n\nInterference Archive is a volunteer-run library, gallery, and archive of historical materials related to social and political activism and movements. It is located in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City.\n\nInterference Archive began as the personal collection of Josh MacPhee and Dara Greenwald, activists who told the \"New York Times\" that they had filled their home with so much \"social movement memorabilia ... Ph.D. students would visit to conduct research.\" The idea to turn it into a public resource began in 2008 when the couple was asked to curate an exhibition at the Exit Art gallery in Manhattan. Using the title \"Signs of Change,\" it showcased cultural artifacts produced by those engaged with groups organizing to foment change. The show and research they did in preparation for it is reflected in the Interference Archive mission statement which begins, \"Interference Archive explores the relationship between cultural production and social movements.\" MacPhee and Greenwald also point to archives and libraries of similar scope and purpose as inspiration, including another Brooklyn-based organization, the Lesbian Herstory Archives.\n\nIn 2010 MacPhee and Greenwald moved their collection to a warehouse in Gowanus, in collaboration with activists and artists Molly Fair and Kevin Caplicki. Greenwald named it Interference Archive, referring to \"the idea that the collection causes static, or interference, in institutional archives and in the larger society.\" It opened its doors to the public in December 2011 with a punk and feminism themed exhibition in tribute to Greenwald, who had been struggling with endometrial cancer and died the following month. \nThe rising prominence and popularity of the Occupy movement emerged as one specific motivation around the time of the Archive's opening, when its founders observed among Occupy participants a need for information about social movements of the past.\n\nInterference Archive has broadened its activities significantly since opening, operating as a library and community space and hosting regular talks, art exhibitions, performances, workshops, and other events. \n\n\"The Guardian\"s Edward Helmore, assessing the place of the Archive among other arts institutions, described it as \"far removed from the realm of commercial art galleries, oligarch collectors, the show-palace museums of billionaire real estate developers, and under the watch of gun-toting revolutionaries from several decades back — and is far the richer for it.\"\n\nIn October 2017, after being evicted from their space in Gowanus, the archive relocated to the nearby Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn and reopened to the public in December 2017. The inaugural exhibit in the new space entitled \"no. NOT EVER\" opened in January 2018. The exhibit is a multidisciplinary and video-based exploration of \"the rise of white nationalism\" in America.\n\nThe archive is housed in an open floor-plan storefront space, filled to the ceiling. The collection includes a number of different kinds of media artifacts which provide information and illustration about the histories of radical political movements around the world, with 40% of the archive coming from outside the United States. Among the materials are posters, fliers, pamphlets, zines, stickers, T-shirts, books, graphic novels, newspapers, games, videos, leaflets, buttons, audio recordings, and other ephemera. The topics it covers includes ACT-UP, Occupy Wall Street, Arab Spring, Code Pink, Pink Bloque, Rock for Choice, Latin American art, nature, ecology, feminism, punk rock, criminal justice, prison reform, apartheid, anti-nuclear movement, squatting, anarchist bookfairs, May 1968 events in France, and Dutch anti-fur activism.\n\nMacPhee summarizes the conceptual basis for the collection as \"material produced by people organizing to transform the world\".\n\nThe owners and volunteers take a pointedly nontraditional approach to archivism. In selection and acquisition, no priority is given to particular movements, media types, or well-known artists. Instead, it positions itself as a commons where people can share what they have and benefit from what was donated by others. Whereas most archives stress materials protection and preservation, the Interference Archive promotes access, physical engagement, and use of the materials to maintain their continued relevance outside of the Archive. Collections are also organized for usability, prioritizing media type and subject over donation or donor.\n\nIn addition to its primary purpose as an archive and library, Interference Archive also functions as a multipurpose community center, gallery, and events space. Past events and exhibitions have covered prison reform, the Asian American movement in New York, underground newspapers, the anti-nuclear movement, and Art+Feminism edit-a-thons.\n\n\"Armed by Design\", a 2015 exhibition, comprised graphic art from \"Tricontinental\", a magazine published by the Cuba-based anti-globalization, anti-imperialist, anticapitalist organization OSPAAL (Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America). \"The Guardian\" described it as \"a fascinating tour of 60s and 70s radical politics and its heroes\".\n\nIn addition to historical materials and preexisting cultural products, the Archive occasionally commissions artists to produce original work. For \"Armed by Design\", the 60s and 70s graphics were supplemented by a new set of topical posters. Another exhibit, \"if a song could be freedom... Organized Sounds of Resistance\", included a series of annotated mixtapes compiled by musicians, historians, and activists.\n\nOne exhibit in April 2013 featured \"book blocs\", home-made cardboard shields glued together by activists for use during college tuition protests. The shields on display as well as others made during a workshop earlier in the month were confiscated as weapons by the New York Police Department the day before they were due to be used at Cooper Union in a protest against the school's decision to begin charging tuition.\n\nSince 2015, volunteers have hosted a podcast which highlights material in the collections and associated exhibits.\n"}

Paul Getty Museum, commonly referred to as the Getty, is an art museum in California housed on two campuses: the Getty Center and Getty Villa. The two locations received over two million visitors in 2016.\n\nThe primary museum, the Getty Center, is located in Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, on a hill top above the west side of the Sepulveda Pass and I-405 freeway. Its collection features Western art from the Middle Ages to the present. \n\nThe secondary museum, the Getty Villa, is in the Malibu neighborhood and displays art from Ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria.\n\nIn 1974, J. Paul Getty opened a museum in a re-creation of the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum on his property in Malibu, California. In 1982, the museum became the richest in the world when it inherited US$1.2 billion. In 1983, after an economic downturn in what was then West Germany, the Getty Museum acquired 144 illuminated medieval manuscripts from the financially struggling Ludwig Collection in Aachen; John Russell, writing in \"The New York Times\", said of the collection, \"One of the finest holdings of its kind ever assembled, it is quite certainly the most important that was in private hands.\" In 1997, the museum moved to its current location in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles; the Malibu museum, renamed the \"Getty Villa\", was renovated and reopened in 2006.\n\nDetailed information about the J. Paul Getty Museum’s collections is provided on GettyGuide, a suite of interactive multimedia tools available at the Museum, as well as on getty.edu. At the GettyGuide stations in the Museum, visitors can get information about exhibitions, interact with a timeline, watch videos on art-making techniques, and more. Also available at the Museum, the GettyGuide multimedia player features commentary from curators and conservators on many works of art. With GettyGuide on the Web, one may browse the Museum’s collection and bookmark works of art to create a customized tour and printable map.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the curator, Jiří Frel, designed a tax manipulation scheme which expanded the museum collection of antiquities, essentially buying artifacts of dubious provenance, as well as a number of artifacts generally considered fakes, such as the Getty kouros. In 1984, Frel was demoted, and in 1986, he resigned.\n\nThe Getty is involved in a controversy regarding proper title to some of the artwork in its collection. The museum's previous curator of antiquities, Marion True (hired by Frel), was indicted in Italy in 2005 (along with famed dealer Robert E. Hecht) on criminal charges relating to trafficking in stolen antiquities. Similar charges have been addressed by the Greek authorities. The primary evidence in the case came from the 1995 raid of a Geneva, Switzerland, warehouse which had contained a fortune in stolen artifacts. Italian art dealer Giacomo Medici was arrested in 1997; his operation was thought to be \"one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market\". In 2005 True was forced to tender her resignation by the Board of Trustees, which announced her early retirement. Italy allowed the statute of limitations of the charges filed against her to expire in October 2010.\n\nIn a letter to the J. Paul Getty Trust on December 18, 2006, True stated that she was being made to \"carry the burden\" for practices which were known, approved, and condoned by the Getty's Board of Directors. True is currently under investigation by Greek authorities over the acquisition of a 2,500-year-old funerary wreath. The wreath, along with a 6th-century BC statue of a woman, have been returned to Greece and are exhibited at the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.\n\nOn November 20, 2006, the director of the museum, Michael Brand, announced that 26 disputed pieces were to be returned to Italy, but not the Victorious Youth, which is still claimed by the Italian authorities. In 2007, the Los Angeles J. Paul Getty Museum was forced to return 40 artifacts, including a 5th-century BC statue of the goddess Aphrodite, which was looted from Morgantina, an ancient Greek settlement in Sicily. The Getty Museum resisted the requests of the Italian government for nearly two decades, only to admit later that \"there might be 'problems'\" attached to the acquisition.\" In 2006, Italian senior cultural official Giuseppe Proietti said: \"The negotiations haven't made a single step forward.\" Only after he suggested the Italian government \"to take cultural sanctions against the Getty, suspending all cultural cooperation,\" did the J. Paul Getty Museum return the antiquities.\n\nIn another unrelated case in 1999, the Getty Museum had to hand over three antiquities to Italy after determining they were stolen. The objects included a Greek red-figure kylix from the 5th-century BC, signed by the painter Onesimos and the potter Euphronios as potter, looted from the Etruscan site of Cerveteri; a torso of the god Mithra from the 2nd-century AD, and the head of a youth by the Greek sculptor Polykleitos.\n\nIn 2016, the terracotta head of the Greek god Hades was returned to Sicily (Italy). The archaeological artifact was looted from Morgantina in the 1970s. The Getty museum purchased the terracotta head of Hades in 1985 from the New York collector Maurice Tempelsman, who had purchased it from the London dealer Robin Symes. Getty records show the museum paid $530,000 for it. On December 21, 2016, the head of Hades was added to the collection of the archaeological museum of Aidone, where it joined the statue of Demeter, the mother of his consort Persephone. Sicilian archaeologists found a blue curl that was missing from Hades' beard, and so it proved the origin of the terracotta head.\n\n"}

At the time of his retirement in 2005, he was the Daniel S. Lehrman Professor of Psychobiology. He was a, painter, and psychotherapist, and most notably a scientist. His scientific research largely established the study of neonate learning and especially mother-offsping behavior throughout the maternal cycle. For the latter work, he was known in developmental psychobiology as the \"father of mothering\". He received several honors and awards during his career including election to American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nRosenblatt was born in the East Bronx, which is part of New York City, New York, the youngest of three children. His mother, a housewife, immigrated from Russia to flee from the pogroms of the early 20th century; his father, a furrier, arrived from Austria as a teenager.\n\nIn high school, the Works Progress Administration allowed him to study art and especially painting. During World War II he was a camouflage artist and he continued to paint the rest of his life. He married Gilda Rosenblatt (née Rosen) who died in 1999. He then married Pat Rosenblatt. He had two children Daniel and Nina.\n\nIn 1946, after the army, Rosenblatt entered New York University. There he met T. C. Schneirla who influenced the direction his scientific interests and research would take. Schneirla convinced Rosenblatt that the study of animal behavior would broaden his understanding of human behavior and that it was interesting in itself. He began his research on the role of hormones and experience on the sexual behavior of male cats. Supported by Schneirla, he began his doctoral work in 1958 at the American Museum of Natural History study of early learning in kittens. He discovered that kittens could orient to home by 3 to 4 days of age and that they formed nipple attachment preferences by 1 to 2 days of age. This was contrary to learning paradigms of that time, which assumed that animals could not learn at very young ages.\nIn the 1950s, while an assistant professor at the City College of New York, he became a person of interest for the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was conveyed to the City College of New York. Subsequently, his contract was not renewed he went to Rutgers University at Newark where he joined the Institute of Animal Behavior the Institute of Animal Behavior founded by Daniel S. Lehrman who he had been friends with during graduate school.\n\nIn 1972, he became director of the Institute of Animal Behavior at Rutgers University-Campus at Newark by unanimous vote after the death it founder Daniel S. Lehrman and remained its director for more than 17 years. He served as dean of the Graduate School of Rutgers University-Newark. He also served as editor for Advance in the Study of Behavior for more than 10 years. In 2005, he retired as Daniel S. Lehrman Professor of Psychobiology. After his retirement, he continued to work at the Rutgers University-Campus at Newark until 2012.\n\nHe was viewed as a successful mentor by those who knew him:\n\nAs a teenager, Rosenblatt apprenticed in the studio of Ben Wilson under the Works in Progress Administration. Wilson had a major impact on him, Rosenblatt would later say of Wilson \"I saw that he was thoughtful and deeply sincere in his work and that he would be supportive of my becoming a painter.\" He would keep in contact with Wilson for 63 years until Wilson died in 2005. Rosenblatt's painting was influenced not only by Wilson but also by painters such as Georges Braque, Paul Cézanne, and Pablo Picasso. The content of his paintings was influenced by Judaism and Marxism. Many of his paintings were political focusing on war and The Holocaust. Another major theme of his paintings were of mothers and their children, which would mirror his scientific interest in maternal behavior as a scientist. For example, in his painting \"Mother and older Child,\" both of his subjective and scientific perspectives of mother-child relationships are expressed, evoking both discomfort and comfort in the viewer. He never became a professional painter, but Rutgers University held a show in the late 1990s for 56 of his paintings.\n\nRosenblatt met psychoanalyst Max Hertzman while he was a teaching assistant at City College of New York. He was interested in psychoanalysis because he wanted to understand better \"intrapsychic events\" in himself and his clients. He also wanted to find out if psychology as he understood it could be applied to real people, which led him to take a job at the Pediatric Psychiatry Clinic at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. There he diagnosed children with emotional and psychological disorders. He discovered that his formal training in psychology helped him to understand the children he diagnosed.\n\nRosenblatt's research in developmental psychobiology focused on early neonate learning and maternal behavior. It explored these processes using multiple levels of analysis, using multiple techniques, and from multiple perspectives (i.e., proximal, functional, comparative, and evolutionary).\n\nIn the 1960s, Rosenblatt experimentally demonstrated that learning in newly born animals occurred earlier than had been thought possible (see Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969). His early work with kittens showed that early learning in neonates initially involved single sensory modalities such as tactile, thermal, and olfactory sensory modalities. As development proceeded these sensory modalities are integrated and learning becomes multimodal. His early work with kittens demonstrated these developmental processes of early learning and set the stage for a new field of research that focuses on neonatal learning in naturalistic contexts (see Rosenblatt, 1971; Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969).\n\nThe discovery of early learning in neonates was, according to Rosenblatt, serendipitous. It occurred while he was studying cats in the 1950s and when he was weighing kittens on a daily basis. He noticed that when he returned the kittens to their home environment (without their mother present), they returned to their home corner faster and faster each day. The kittens' eyes had not yet opened during this time and so they were blind to any visual stimuli. The only way they could find the corner they had been in is by learning the olfactory characteristics of that area in their home environment where they had been nursed (see Rosenblatt, 1983; Rosenblatt, Turkewitz, and Schneirla, 1969).\n\nHe did his seminal work on maternal behavior during the late 1960s through the 1970s. This work consisted of two major themes: behavioral transitions in maternal cyclic patterns of behavior and the coupling of mother-offspring behavior during these maternal cycles (Rosenblatt, 1970). His work on maternal behavior, starting in the 1960s, focused primarily on the rat as an animal model. He identified three important phases in \nmaternal cyclic patterns of behavior: the first phase spans conception through most of pregnancy, the second begins towards the end of pregnancy and continues through birth, and the third is the maintenance phase, which extends from the postpartum phase to weaning. He began his research by describing the phenomena associated with each of these phases of the mother-offspring cyclic patterns of behavior. His studies also determined the role of sensory factors in mother and offspring behavior. He investigated physiological, hormonal, and affective mechanisms and their feedback in maternal and offspring cyclic patterns of behavior (Rosenblatt, 1980). It is because of Rosenblatt's early study of maternal behavior, the coupling of mother-offspring behavior, and his conceptualization of these behavioral processes as occurring in phases that he is often called \"father of mothering\" or \"father of maternal behavior\" within the field of psychobiology.\n\nRosenblatt's 1967 study of the induction of maternal behavior is consider by many in his field to be his most famous study. In that study he showed that the neural basis of parental care is independent of pregnancy and birth. He found that he could induce maternal behavior in virgin female rats during a 6 to 8 day period by continuously exposing them to rat pups. He also found that female rats that were ovariectomized or hypophysectomized could also be induced to exhibit maternal behavior via the continuous exposure to rat pups. Although the hormonal and physiological processes that occur during pregnancy and birth enhance maternal behavior, maternal behavior has an already developed neural basis in the brain.\n\nHe received several honors and awards during his career.\nIn 1971, he was elected as a fellow of the Animal Behavior Society.\nIn 2004, he was elected as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\nIn 1986, a volume of the \"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences\" was published in honor of Jay S. Rosenblatt for his contributions to the field of animal behavior.\nIn 1987, he received a Doctorate honoris causa from the University of Gothenburg and, in 1997, he received a Doctorate honoris causa from the National University of Distance Education.\n\nDuring his career, Rosenblatt published over 160 articles and chapters.\n"}

It was seen as an extension of the 1997 Moscow Memorandum but was ultimately rejected by Moldovan president Vladimir Voronin.\n\nThe plan, presented in mid-November 2003 by Russia, was a detailed proposal for a united \"asymmetric\" federal Moldavian state. First published in Russian on the website of Transnistria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the text was promoted by a Russian politician Dmitry Kozak, close ally of President Vladimir Putin and one of the key figures in his presidential team. For Transnistria, the memorandum presented an end to the previous Moscow policy, which assumed that the region would have equal status in federation with the rest of the country. According to the memorandum Russian troops (no more than 2000 strong, without heavy armaments) would remain in Transnistria for the transitional period but not later than 2020.\n\nIt was proposed that the competences of government of the federal Moldova would be divided into three categories: those of the federation, those of individual subjects and those of joint competences. The plan presented several issues risking to cause blockage in policy-making. A lower house, elected by proportional representation, would pass legislation by simple majority. All organic laws (pertaining to the change of the federal power structure - section 7b) would need the assent of the senate (not \"all laws\"), however, whose representation would be disproportionate with respect to population figures: 13 senators elected by the federal lower house, nine by Transnistria and four by Gagauzia. By 2004 Transnistria had 14% and Gagauzia 4% of Moldova's total population. By this plan, Transnistrian senators would be able to block changes to the constitution of the unified state. Laws concerning the Federation (Moldova excluding Transnistria and Gagauzia) would not need ratification by the Senate.\n\nLarge demonstrations against the Kozak memorandum took place in Chişinău in the days following the publication of the Russian proposal. Moldova's leadership declined to sign memorandum without coordination with the European organizations. A visit by President Putin to Moldova was canceled. Later in 2005, President Vladimir Voronin made a statement rejecting the 2003 Kozak memorandum because of contradiction with the Moldovan constitution which defines Moldova as a neutral state and could not allow any foreign troops on its soil, while the country cannot join military alliances. Moldova and the Kozak memorandum was a key issue at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ministerial meeting in Maastricht in December 2003, and disagreement between Russia on the one hand, and the EU and the US on the other on Moldova, was one of the principal reasons why a final joint declaration was not adopted after the meeting.\n\n"}

Patten, 244 F. 535 (S.D.N.Y. 1917), was a decision by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, that addressed advocacy of illegal activity under the First Amendment.\n\nIn cases such as \"Abrams v. United States\", 250 U.S. 616 (1919) and \"Gitlow v. New York\", 268 U.S. 652 (1925) and others, the United States Supreme Court struggled to draw the line between politically unpopular speech and actual threats to national security. \"Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten\" greatly influenced the Supreme Court's eventual adoption in \"Brandenburg v. Ohio\" of the \"incitement test\" for advocacy of illegal activity.\n\nAt issue in \"Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten\" was the federal Espionage Act of 1917, which prohibited citizens from counseling or advising violation of the law.

{"id": "476030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=476030", "title": "NSC 68", "text": "NSC 68\n\nUnited States Objectives and Programs for National Security, better known as NSC68, was a 66-page top secret National Security Council (NSC) policy paper drafted by the Department of State and Department of Defense and presented to President Harry S. Truman on 7 April 1950. It was one of the most important American policy statements of the Cold War. In the words of scholar Ernest R. May, NSC68 \"provided the blueprint for the militarization of the Cold War from 1950 to the collapse of the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 1990s.\" NSC68 and its subsequent amplifications advocated a large expansion in the military budget of the United States, the development of a hydrogen bomb, and increased military aid to allies of the United States. It made the rollback of global Communist expansion a high priority. NSC68 rejected the alternative policies of friendly détente and containment of the Soviet Union.\n\nBy 1950, events dictated the need to examine U.S. national security policies: the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was operational; military assistance for European allies had begun; the Soviet Union had detonated an atomic bomb and the communists had solidified their control of China. In addition, a British sterling-dollar crisis in the summer of 1949 had brought home to U.S. officials that the Marshall Plan would not suffice to cure Western European economic ills by 1952, the Plan's scheduled end year, with the prospect that Western Europe would have no choice but to pursue autarky, as it had in the 1930s, with all the attendant difficulties that would pose for the world economy generally and the U.S. economy particularly. Similar problems were also plaguing Japan. With these threats to the U.S. and its allies expanding, on 31 January 1950 President Truman directed the Department of State and Department of Defense \"to undertake a reexamination of our objectives in peace and war and of the effect of these objectives on our strategic plans.\" A State-Defense Policy Review Group was set up under the chairmanship of Paul Nitze of the State Department.\n\nThe Defense Department representatives on the committee initially resisted proposals that would exceed the existing $12.5 billion ceiling on defense spending.\n\nThe report, designated NSC68, was presented to President Truman on 7 April 1950, who passed it on to the NSC for further consideration on 12 April 1950.\n\nNSC Study Group:\nOriginally, President Truman did not support NSC68 when it was brought to him in 1950. He believed that it was not specific about which programs would be affected or changed and it also didn't go well with his previous defense spending limits. Truman sent it back for further review until he finally approved it in 1951.\n\nThe document outlined the de facto national security strategy of the United States for that time (though it was not an official NSS in the form we know today) and analyzed the capabilities of the Soviet Union and of the United States of America from military, economic, political, and psychological standpoints.\n\nNSC68 described the challenges facing the United States in cataclysmic terms. \"The issues that face us are momentous,\" the document stated, \"involving the fulfillment or destruction not only of this Republic but of civilization itself.\"\n\nNSC68 saw the goals and aims of the United States as sound, yet poorly implemented, calling \"present programs and plans... dangerously inadequate\". Although George F. Kennan's theory of containment articulated a multifaceted approach for U.S. foreign policy in response to the perceived Soviet threat, the report recommended policies that emphasized military over diplomatic action. Kennan's influential 1947 \"X\" article advocated a policy of containment towards the Soviet Union. It described containment as \"a policy of calculated and gradual coercion\" and called for significant peacetime military spending, in which the U.S. possessed \"superior overall power\" \"in dependable combination with other like-minded nations.\" In particular, it called for a military capable of\n\nNSC68 itself did not contain any specific cost estimates at a time when the United States was committing six to seven percent of its GNP to defense. It was evident that the limits the President had previously set on defense spending were too low. The report called for tripling defense spending to $40 or $50 billion per year from the original $13 billion set for 1950. It specified a reduction of taxes and a \"reduction of Federal expenditures for purposes other than defense and foreign assistance, if necessary by the deferment of certain desirable programs\", as a means for paying for it. However, several officials involved in the preparation of the study, including the future chairman of the president's Council of Economic Relations Leon Keyserling, suggested that the massive increase in military spending could be afforded by deliberate acceptance of government deficits, which would have the added benefit of energising and stimulating parts of the American economy, as it did after 1930. Indeed, the document does note that achieving a high gross national product “might itself be aided by a build-up of the economic and military strength of the United States…”, and the Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Lovett also suggested that the American economy \"might benefit from the kind of build-up we are suggesting\".\n\n\"For several centuries, it had proved impossible for any one nation to gain such preponderant strength that a coalition of other nations could not in time face it with greater strength.\"\n—NSC 68 p. 4\n\nServing as the main point of the opening paragraph of NSC68, this sentence is a reference to the U.S. leading the international community out of World War II (by way of ending the war in Japan). The 'one nation' is in reference to the Nazis, and the 'coalition of other nations' is in reference to the Allied nations during World War II.\n\nThe document continues to identify that the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, if allowed to grow, would become such a powerful force, that no coalition of nations could band together and oppose it. This is significant because firstly, the Soviet Union is identified in the document as the antithesis of the United States, and secondly, the Soviet Union is committed to extending its sphere of influence.\n\nA thorough knowledge of this document is required for understanding U.S. foreign policymakers in the early Cold War. After reading this document, they rapidly recognized the need for militarization out of the interest of self-preservation. In other words, the aggressive nature of Soviet expansion required a strong response from the U.S. in order to prevent the destruction of America. This, of course, was phrased in a context of military exploits (referring to the military victory in World War I and World War II), and therefore emphasized military expansion.\n\nAlso crucial in understanding this document is the language. Indeed, primary sources must be read carefully, in order to recognize themes or motifs. Adjectives provide valuable insight into the motives of this document's authors, and the impression it had on its intended audience. An example is the description of the international situation, as provoked by the Soviet Union, as endemic. By using this language, it is clear that the authors wished to portray the Soviet Union as a sickness, and the U.S. as the cure. This message was received loud and clear, and dominated many foreign policy decisions throughout the Cold War.\n\nNSC68 drew some criticism from senior government officials who believed the Cold War was being escalated unnecessarily. When the report was sent to top officials in the Truman administration for review before its official delivery to the President, many of them scoffed at its arguments. Willard Thorp questioned its contention that the \"USSR is steadily reducing the discrepancy between its overall economic strength and that of the United States.\" Thorp argued: \"I do not feel that this position is demonstrated, but rather the reverse... The actual gap is widening in our favor.\" He pointed out that in 1949 the US economy had increased twofold over that of the Soviet Union. Steel production in the US outpaced the Soviet Union by 2 million tons; stockpiling of goods and oil production both far exceeded Soviet amounts. As for Soviet military investment, Thorp was skeptical that the USSR was committing such large portion of its GDP: \"I suspect a larger portion of Soviet investment went into housing.\" William Schaub of the Bureau of the Budget was particularly harsh, believing that \"in every arena,\" the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, the stockpiling of atomic bombs, the economy, the US was far superior to the Soviet Union. Kennan, although \"father\" of the containment policy, also disagreed with the document, particularly its call for massive rearmament (FRUS, 1950, Vol. I).\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman, even after the Soviets became a nuclear power, sought to curb military spending. However, he did not reject the recommendations of NSC68 out of hand, instead of returning it to circulation and asking for an estimate of the costs involved. In the ensuing two months, little progress was made on the report. By June, Nitze had practically given up on it. But on 25 June 1950, North Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel north. With the Korean War begun, NSC68 took on new importance. As Acheson later remarked: \"Korea... created the stimulus which made action.\"\n\nThe Truman Administration began a nationwide public relations campaign to convince Congress and opinion-setters of the need for strategic rearmament and containment of Soviet communism. It had to overcome isolationists, including Senator Robert A. Taft, who wanted less world involvement, as well as intense anti-Communists such as James Burnham who proposed an alternative strategy of rollback that would eliminate Communism or perhaps launch a preemptive war. The State Department and the White House used the North Korean attack of June 1950 and the see-saw battles during the first few months of the Korean War to steer congressional and public opinion toward a course of rearmament between the two poles of preventive war and isolationism.\n\nNSC68 is a source of much historical debate as is the escalation of the Cold War. It was an important part of an overall shift in American foreign policy to a comprehensive containment strategy that was confirmed by successive administrations. In 1962 scholar Paul Y. Hammond presented the first detailed, contemporary, interviews-based account of the formation of NSC68. Analyses range from Michael Hogan's belief that NSC68 portrayed the threat \"in the worst light possible\" to those believing provided an accurate picture of a genuine and growing threat.\n\nThis document is critical to understanding the Cold War with its effect on similar national security documents such as the National Security Strategy March 2005, but also provides insight to current US foreign policy. Implementation of NSC68 shows the extent to which it marked a 'shift' in US policy — not only toward the USSR, but toward all communist governments. By signing the document, Truman provided a clearly defined and coherent US policy that did not really exist previously. Furthermore, it can be argued that NSC68, as proposed by the council, addressed Truman's problem of being attacked from the right following the \"red scare\" and Alger Hiss case. Although not made public, NSC68 was manifested in subsequent increases in America's conventional and nuclear capabilities, thereby adding to the country's financial burden. While NSC68 did not make any specific recommendations regarding the proposed increase in defense expenditures, the Truman Administration almost tripled defense spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product between 1950 and 1953 (from 5 to 14.2 percent).\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is located on Mexico City's main square, the Plaza de la Constitución (\"El Zócalo\"). This site has been a palace for the ruling class of Mexico since the Aztec empire, and much of the current palace's building materials are from the original one that belonged to Moctezuma II.\n\nUsed and classified as a Government Building, the National Palace, with its red tezontle facade, fills the entire east side of the Zócalo, measuring over 200 meters long. It is home to some of the offices of both the Federal Treasury and the National Archives.\n\nThe facade is bordered on the north and south by two towers and includes three main doorways, each of which lead to a different part of the building. The southern door leads to the Patio of Honor and presidential offices (no public access). The northern door is known as the Mariana Door, named in honor of Mariano Arista who had it constructed in 1850. The area next to this door used to be the old Court Prison, with courtrooms and torture chambers. It is now occupied by the Finance Ministry. It contains the Treasury Room, constructed by architects Manuel Ortiz Monasterio and Vicente Mendiola. The iron and bronze door is the work of Augusto Petriccioli.\nAbove the central doorway, facing the Zócalo, is the main balcony where just before 11pm on September 15, the president of Mexico gives the Grito de Dolores, in a ceremony to commemorate Mexican Independence. Part of this ceremony includes ringing the bell that hangs above the balcony. This bell is the original one that Father Miguel Hidalgo rang to call for rebellion against Spain. It originally hung in the church of Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, but was relocated here. In the niche containing the bell, there is the Mexican coat of arms. On each side there is an Aztec eagle knight and his Spanish counterpart. These were sculpted by Manuel Centurion and symbolize the synthesis of Mexican culture and Spanish culture.\nThe central door leads to the main patio which is surrounded by Baroque arches. Only the balustrade of this area has been remodeled, conserving the murals by Diego Rivera that adorn the main stairwell and the walls of the second floor. In the stairwell is a mural depicting the history of Mexico from 1521 to 1930, and covers an area of 450 m (4800 ft). These murals were painted between 1929 and 1935, jointly titled \"The Epic of the Mexican People\". The work is divided like a triptych with each being somewhat autonomous. The right-hand wall contains murals depicting pre-Hispanic Mexico and centers around the life of the Aztec god Quetzalcóatl. Quetzalcóatl appears in the mural as a star, a god, and a human being. Created by serpents, he sails through space as a star that accompanies the sun at night. Quetzalcóatl then assumes a human body to teach the Aztec people as their king and patriarch. Last, when he sacrifices his blood to give life to men, he returns to the sky having completed his earthly cycle. Once he leaves the earth, Quetzalcóatl assumes the shape the morning star, called Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli. The cycle that he undergoes signifies the continuous cycle of life. Rivera's creation of a Mexican identity helps to continue the reform that began with the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Before this time, any individualism from the Indians was discouraged as well as any allusion toward Aztec origins. The mural aims to dismiss any idea of inferiority.\n\nIn the middle and largest panel, the Conquest is depicted with its ugliness, such as rape and torture, as well as priests defending the rights of the indigenous people. The battle for independence occupies the uppermost part of this panel in the arch. The American and French invasions are represented below this, as well as the Reform period and the Revolution. The left-hand panel is dedicated to early and mid-20th century, criticizing the status quo and depicting a Marxist kind of utopia, featuring the persons of Plutarco Elías Calles, John D. Rockefeller, Harry Sinclair, William Durant, J.P. Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt and Andrew Mellon as well as Karl Marx. This part of the mural also includes Frida Kahlo, Diego's wife. This mural reflects Diego's own personal views about Mexico's history and the indigenous people of the country in particular.\n\nDiego also painted 11 panels on the middle floor, such as the \"Tianguis of Tlatelolco\" (tianguis means \"market\"), and the \"Arrival of Hernán Cortés in Veracruz\". These are part of a series depicting the pre-Hispanic era. Peoples such as the Tarascos of Michoacán, the Zapotecs and Mixtecs of Oaxaca and the Huastecs of Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí and Veracruz. However, this series was not finished.\n\nOn the upper floor is what once was the Theatre Room of the viceroys, which became the Chamber of Deputies from 1829 to August 22, 1872, when the room was accidentally destroyed by fire. In this parliamentary chamber the Reform Constitution of 1857 was written. This and the Constitution of 1917 are on display.\n\nThe Palace has fourteen courtyards but only a few of these, such as the Grand Courtyard beyond the central portal, are open to the public. The National Palace also houses the main State Archives, with many historical documents, and the Biblioteca Miguel Lerdo de Tejada, one of the largest and most important libraries in the country.\n\nOn north annex of the building is the Treasury Room and the Benito Juárez Museum. Between the two is the Empress Stairway, built by brothers Juan and Ramón Agea. When faced with claims that their work was unstable and would collapse, they had a full battalion charge down them while they stood underneath. The Treasury Room is no longer in use. Leading to the Museum part of the complex, which used to be the Finance Ministry, is a statue of Benito Juárez by Miguel Noreña. This work was criticized at the time because it was felt that such an honored person should not be depicted sitting on his coattails, as it was contrary to social etiquette at the time. In the Finance Ministry patio is the Benito Juárez Room, where this president lived during the end of his term and where he died on July 18, 1872. The bedroom, living room and study have been preserved complete with a number of objects belonging to the president.\n\nThe site and much of the building material of the current building is of what were called Moctezuma II's \"New Houses\". This palace functioned as the Aztec tlatoani's residence and performed a number of official functions as well. The building was divided into two sections and decorated with marble and painted stucco. The main façade contained the shield of the monarchy, an eagle with a snake in its claws. It has three patios surrounded by porticos, indoor sanitary facilities, fountains and gardens. The bedrooms had tapestries of cotton, feathers and rabbit fur painted in bright colors. The floors were of polished stucco and covered in animal furs and finely-woven mats. There were rooms for servants, administrative staff, and military guards, along with kitchens, pantries and storage rooms. The richness of the palace surprised Cortés, which he relayed in letters to Charles I of Spain.\n\nThe palace also held a chamber reserved for the \"tlacxitlan\" where a group of elders, presided over by the emperor himself, would settle disputes among the citizenry. After the Conquest, these New Houses were not completely leveled to the ground but were sufficiently destroyed as to make them uninhabitable.\n\nThe land and the buildings on it were claimed by Hernán Cortés, who had architects Rodrigo de Pontocillos and Juan Rodríguez rebuild the palace while Cortés lived in the \"Old Houses\" (now the Nacional Monte de Piedad building) across the plaza from 1521 to 1530.\n\nCortés's palace was a massive fortress with embrasures for cannon at the corners and the mezzanine had crenels for musketeers. The façade had only two doors with arches (medio punto). Inside there were two patios, with a third being built after 1554 and a fourth sometime after that. Its garden was extensive, occupying much of the south and southwest portions of the property up to what is now Correo Mayor Street. The palace has living quarters, offices, two audience rooms, and a tower for gunpowder. A secondary building behind the main one has nineteen windows spanning its façade. It also had a parapet, above which was a clock and a bell. The main courtyard was built large enough so he could entertain visitors with New Spain's first recorded bullfights.\n\nThe Spanish crown bought the palace from the Cortés family in 1562 to house the Viceregal Palace. It remained so until Mexican Independence in the 1820s.\n\nIn 1562, the Spanish Crown bought the palace and land from Martin Cortés, son of Hernan Cortés, retaining much of the Cortés palace features.\nDue to tensions between the viceroy and the archbishop, the palace was set on fire by supporters of the archbishop in 1624. On 8 June 1692, the palace was almost completely destroyed. Viceroy Gaspar de Sandoval then had Friar Diego Valverde reconstruct the palace. Historian Manuel Rivera Cambas states that after reconstruction, the palace lost its fortress-like appearance, and took on a Baroque appearance. Its crenels were converted into windows with ironwork grilles. framed in stonework. Inscriptions were etched above these windows and coats-of-arms were places to the sides. A smaller, third door was added on the north side of the building. On the inner, secondary building, tall windows with small ironwork balconies were installed. The south door led to what was named the \"Patio of Honor\"; in this section were the viceroy's quarters. The mezzanine held the offices of the Secretary and the Archives of the Viceroyalty. The lower part has servants' and halberdiers' quarters as well as storage bins for mercury. This Patio of Honor opened in back toward a garden for the use of the viceroy and his court. This later became the Royal Botanical Garden in the 18th century.\n\nThe main patio in the central part of the building had arches around it supported by tall, thick Baroque columns. Through this patio was access to the Audience Hall, the tax collection room, the consulate, the office of mining regulation, the General Treasury, the Royal Chapel and the Throne Room.\n\nThe north door led to a small patio in which was located the jail and the guards' quarters. The palace essentially remained unchanged until after independence in the 1830s.\n\nMany of Mexico's leaders after independence made changes to the Viceroy Palace, including renaming it the \"National Palace\". Mexico's first ministries were installed such as the Ministry of Hacienda (internal revenue), Ministry of War, Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Internal and External Relations, as well as the Supreme Court. During an uprising led by Valentín Gómez Farías against then-president Anastasio Bustamante, the southwest balustrade was seriously damaged during a siege lasting twelve days. In 1845, the old Chambers of Deputies was constructed, with the Senate on the upper floor of the south wing. In 1850, Mariano Arista had the old north prison door cemented shut and constructed the current northern door. He also converted the north wing into barracks of the \"Batallón de Guardia de Supremos Poderes\" (Battalion of Guards for the Supreme Powers). In 1864, Maximilian of Habsburg had three flagpoles installed in front of the three main doors. By the central door was the Mexican flag; at the north door was the flag of Austria and at the south door was the flag of France. He also had Lorenzo de la Hidalga construct the grand marble staircase that is in the Patio of Honor in the southern wing, as well as having the public rooms roofed and furnished with paintings, candelabras, and chamber pots from Hollenbach, Austria and Sirres, France. In opposition, Benito Juárez chose to have his quarters in the north end of the Palace, rather than in the traditional southern end.\n\nIn 1877, the Secretaría de Hacienda y Credito Público (Secretary of Internal Revenue and Public Credit), José Ives Limantour, as part of his overhaul of the department, moved their offices to the north wing, finishing in 1902. He chose the largest room in the wing for the Office of Seals. In 1896, the bell that Father Hidalgo rung at the parish of Dolores, Guanajuato was moved here.\n\nA number of changes were made during the rule of Porfirio Díaz. The English-made clock on the parapet was moved to the tower of the Church of Santo Domingo. The façade was cemented over and etched to look like stone block. Cloth awnings were placed on the windows of the upper floors. On pedestals near the main door, statues of female forms were placed. Inside, the ambassador's room, the dining room, the kitchens, the lounge, the garages and the stables were all refurnished. This was done at a time when French style was popular in Mexico.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1929, the third floor was added during the term of President Plutarco Elías Calles by Alberto J. Pani, an engineer and then finance minister and designed by Augusto Petriccioli. Merlons were placed on the towers and parapet and decorative caps were placed on all three doors. The Dolores Bell was placed in a niche flanked by atlantes above the balcony above the central door. The façade was covered with red tezontle stone and installed stone frames on the doors, windows, cornices, and parapets. In the interior, a grand staircase of marble was installed in the central patio (where Diego Rivera would later paint The History of Mexico mural) and constructed stairs to the internal revenue department and the offices of the General Treasury in the north wing. The old Chamber of Deputies, abandoned after a fire in 1872, was reconstructed and re-inaugurated as a museum to the centennial. A statue of Benito Juárez was placed in the north wing near his old quarters. This statue was made with bronze from the cannons of the Conservative Army during the Reform War and from French projectiles from the Battle of Puebla. This caused the Palace to lose its Baroque (and French) appearance and give it the appearance it has today.\n\nAll the viceroys that ruled New Spain during the colonial period lived in this residence except for Antonio de Mendoza and Juan O’Donojú, the first and last viceroys. After independence, the palace was home to the two emperors who ruled Mexico during brief periods: Agustin de Iturbide and Maximilian I of Mexico. The first president to live in the building was also Mexico's first president, Guadalupe Victoria, and its last occupant in the 19th century was Manuel González, president from 1880 to 1884. After that, the presidential residence was Los Pinos, but the National Palace became the official residence once again with Andrés Manuel López Obrador, president since 2018. Famous people who stayed here include Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, Mateo Alemán, Friar Servando de Mier (he also died here), Alexander von Humboldt and Simón Bolívar.\n\nOn November 8, 2014, alleged Anarchists deliberatedly damaged the palace facade and windows with graffiti and by breaking windows, and burned down a section of the Mariana Door after a failed attempt at breaking it down. The National Institute of History and Anthropology (INAH) handled the restoration and presented charges for the damages.\n\nBecause of work related to the construction of Metro Line 2 and the acceleration of the sinking of many of the buildings in the historic center, the basic structure of the Palace suffered deterioration, requiring work to secure the building's foundation and supports, especially on the third floor, the central patio and the Patio of Honor. During this work, the old column bases of the Viceroy Palace were found, two of which were restored where they were found. They also found old cedar rafters with their brackets, which were used to form the foundation of the first floor.\n\nRecently, excavations in and next to the National Palace have unearthed parts of Moctezuma's \"New Houses\", the name of the palaces that Hernán Cortés razed to build what has become the current edifice. Parts of a wall and a basalt floor were found during recent renovations on the building that now houses the Museum of Culture, which adjoins the Palace on its north side. The wall and floor are believed to be part of Casa Denegrida, or the Black House, which Spanish conquerors described as a windowless room painted in black. In here, Moctezuma would meditate on what he was told by professional seers and shamans. It was part of a construction which is thought to have consisted of five interconnected buildings containing the emperor's office, chambers for children and several wives and even a zoo. More excavations are planned.\n\nOn the webpage of past president Ernesto Zedillo, Carlos Fuentes calls the National Palace a \"traveling and an immobile construction\". Traveling is used in the sense that much of its architectural style is Spanish in origin and symbolized the transplanting of Spanish civilization to the New World. It is immobile in the sense that since Aztec times, this has been the seat of earthly political power, first as the palaces of the Aztec tlatoani, then of the Spanish viceroys, then of Mexican heads of state. Only until very recently, those who held power over Mexico lived here as well as asserted their authority.\n\nThe building itself represents the Mexican people as a blending of both Spanish and Aztec. The old palace was destroyed to make way for the new, but both were built of the very same stone. According to Zedillo, this represents something that is not quite Aztec, but not quite Spanish either, much like the country itself. These same stones were present during all of Mexico's major historical events and had seen foreign flags fly above them.\n\nOn the eve of Mexican Independence Day, the National Palace is the star of the show. The original bell Father Hidalgo rang is here and the President himself gives the Grito de Dolores from its main balcony. He also notes one such Independence Eve, in 1964, when General Charles de Gaulle, then-President of France, spoke to the crowd in Spanish from the Palace. He notes this to assert that the Palace is not only a place but also a destination where friends of the country can be welcomed.\n\n"}

{"id": "30499776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30499776", "title": "Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence", "text": "Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence\n\nThe Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence occurred on February 28, 1914, as a reaction to the incorporation of Northern Epirus into the newly established Principality of Albania. The region of Northern Epirus, which corresponds to modern-day southern Albania, came under the control of the Greek forces during the Balkan Wars of 1912–13. However, the subsequent Protocol of Florence assigned it to the newly established Albanian state, a decision that was rejected by the local Greek population. As the Greek army withdrew to the new border, a Panepirotic Assembly was organized by the representatives of Northern Epirus in Gjirokastër (Greek: Argyrokastro). Given the fact that union of Northern Epirus with Greece had already been dismissed by the European Great Powers, they decided that only autonomy or alternatively an international occupation would be appropriate for the region. Finally, Georgios Christakis-Zografos, the head of the assembly, declared the independence of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus.\n\nIn a proclamation to the people of Northern Epirus, Zografos maintained that their aspirations were ignored, since the Great Powers had rejected self-government within the Albanian state. Following negotiations between Albanian and Northern Epirote representatives in early May, and with the intervention of the Great Powers, the Protocol of Corfu was signed. According to this agreement, Northern Epirus would be an autonomous, fully self-governing part of Albania under the suzerainty of the Albanian prince. However, the Protocol, which recognized the Greek character of the region, was never implemented due to political instability in Albania that time.\n\nDuring the First Balkan War (1912-1913), the Greek Army breached the Ottoman defences in the Epirus front and advanced further north. Thus, after the end of the war Greece controlled the historical region of Epirus. However the Treaty of London (May 1913) and the Protocol of Florence (December 1913) awarded the northern part to the newly established Principality of Albania. This area which rouphly coincided to the former Ottoman provinces (sanjaks) of Ergiri and Görice, became then known by the Greeks as Northern Epirus ( \"Voreios Ipiros\"'). This decision by the European Great Powers was unpopular among the local Greek population.\n\nBy the terms of the Protocol of Florence, the Greek government was obliged to evacuate its forces from the area to the new Greco-Albanian border line. The Greek government however raised concerns about the evacuation process of the Greek forces, pointing out to the Great Powers that the newly established Albanian state was unable to secure the region immediately. In particular the Greek government and the local population feared the possibility of reprisals and atrocities at the hands of Albanian irregular groups. In order to arrange the details of the evacuation with the International Commission of Control, an organization set up by the Great Powers to secure peace and stability in the region, the Greek prefect of Corfu moved to Vlorë, where the provisional government of Albania was based. Meanwhile, the Greek authorities reassured the local Greek population that the Greek government would undertake initiatives to secure for them recognition of minority status and rights in Albanian legislation. The Greek authorities also warned the population of the town of Korçë (Greek: Korytsa) that any action against incorporation into Albania would be fruitless. They also insisted that the Greek army would only hand over control of the region to regular Albanian units led by Dutch officers from the International Commission, whereas the Greek forces would fire upon any irregular Albanian bands who attempted to enter the region.\n\nBefore the evacuation of the Greek Army began, an assembly of representatives of Northern Epirus, the \"Panepirotic Assembly of Argyrokastro\" (), took place on 13 February 1914 at Gjirokaster (Greek: Argyrokastro). Given the fact that unification of Northern Epirus with Greece had already been dismissed by the Great Powers, the assembly decided that they would only accept local autonomy, or failing that, an international occupation. They also declared that the population of Northern Epirus felt betrayed by the official Greek government, which not only refused to provide arms, but also agreed to withdraw gradually in order to allow the Albanian forces to proceed with the occupation of Northern Epirus.\n\nThe Assembly triggered a series of events. Georgios Christakis-Zografos, a former Greek foreign minister and native of the region, arrived at Gjirokaster and discussed the situation with the local representatives. In order to ensure the protection of the local population, Zografos proposed three options to the European Powers for Northern Epirus: full autonomy under the nominal sovereignty of the Prince of Albania, extensive administrative or cantonal-type autonomy with a gendarmerie recruited exclusively among locals, or a period of direct control by the Great Powers for such time until foreign troops could be withdrawn without endangering the local populace. The Northern Epirote representatives also demanded formal recognition of the particular educational and religious rights of the local Greek Orthodox population. Moreover, for the coastal region of Himara, the Assembly claimed the same privileges and autonomous status it had enjoyed during the Ottoman era. On February 22, Zografos sent a note to the representatives of the Great Powers where he addressed the present situation:\n\nThe following week a number of cities declared their autonomy: Himara, Gjirokaster, Sarandë (Agioi Saranta) and Delvinë (Delvino).\n\nConsequently, on 28 February 1914, the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was declared and a provisional government was formed to support the state's objectives. Christakis-Zografos himself became president of the provisional government. In a proclamation to the people of Northern Epirus, Zografos maintained that their aspirations had been ignored, that the Great Powers had even denied them self-government within the Albanian state, as well as guarantees for the protection of life, property, religious freedom and of their national existence. The proclamation also called upon the Epirotes to make every sacrifice defending the integrity of Northern Epirus and its liberties from any attack whatsoever.\n\nThe declaration was also signed by the heads of the local Greek Orthodox metropolitan bishoprics: Vasileios of Dryinoupolis, Spyridon of Vela and Konitsa and Germanos of Korytsa. On the day of the declaration, Zografos notified the International Control Commission of his appointment as president of the provisional government and announced that the Epirotes would regard any attempt by the newly founded Albanian Gendarmerie to cross their border as an act of hostility and would resist it. The Autonomous Northern Epirus also included Himara, Delvino, Sarandë, and Përmet (Premeti).\n\nOn the same day, Zografos sent a telegram to Korçë urging the people to follow the example of the rest of the Northern Epirotes. However, on March 1, under the terms of the Protocol of Florence the town surrendered to the Albanian Gendarmerie. The Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, immediately ordered the withdrawal and handover of the nearby region of Kolonjë to the Albanian units, before the population could join the uprising too. As a result, bishop Spyridon, who planned to become the head of the autonomy movement in this region, was arrested and expelled by the Greek authorities.\n\nIn his speech on 2 March, Zografos concluded that the Northern Epirotes, after five centuries of Ottoman occupation, would not accept the destiny which the Powers had imposed upon them. The following days Alexandros Karapanos became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Dimitrios Doulis Minister of War of the provisional government. Doulis, a native of Northern Epirus, had earlier resigned from his post as a Colonel of the Greek Army and joined the revolutionary forces of Northern Epirus. The Northern Epirote army reached the number of 5,000 men from the first days of its formation. The army's core consisted mainly of former members of the Greek Army, some of whom were of local Epirote ancestry. With the support of irregular volunteer units it reached a total manpower of approximately 10,000.\n\nThe Greek Army continued with the evacuation of the region, but the process slowed down out of fear that a hasty withdrawal might offer the opportunity to irregular bands to carry out atrocities against the civilian population. As the official position of the Greek government towards the uprising was that of strict neutrality, Prime Minister Venizelos ordered the blockade of the port of Sarandë and prohibited a demonstration in Athens in favor of the uprising. However, it cannot be doubted that the Greek government sympathized with the demands of the Northern Epirotes. In fact, the only way for Venizelos to stop the uprising would have been to declare martial law in the region, but this action would have caused major political instability and the possible resignation of his government. The opposition parties in Greece even accused Venizelos of going beyond what was required of him to comply with the decision of the Great Powers, and instead of simply evacuating the districts, he was handing them over to the Albanians and depriving the Epirotes of any means of resistance.\n\nOn the other hand, the Albanian government, unable to deal with the Northern Epirus movement, requested that the Great Powers take measures. The Albanian government claimed that although the Greek Army was evacuating the region, it was being replaced by guerrilla fighters organized by the Greek authorities. Meanwhile, on March 7, 1914, Prince William of Wied arrived in Albania and immediately ordered the Dutch colonel Lodewijk Thomson to negotiate with the Northern Epirote representatives. Thompson met with Karapanos on March 10, and proposed a limited local administration for Northern Epirus under a Christian governor in addition to guarantees of religious and educational rights. Thompson's initiative was dismissed by the Northern Epirote side.\n\nOn April 11, Epirote revolutionaries took control of Korçë, but four days later the Albanian Gendarmerie, led by Dutch officers, recaptured the city. As a result, the Dutch arrested and expelled the Greek Orthodox bishop Germanos, since they had proof that he was the chief instigator of the uprising, as well as other members of the town council. After the complete withdrawal of the Greek Army from the region on April 28, conflicts between the Northern Epirote forces and Albanian gendarmes broke out in several locations. Intense fighting occurred in the region of Cepo, north of Gjirokastër, where Albanian gendarmerie units tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate southwardly, facing resistance from the Northern Epirote forces. On the other hand, the Epirotes managed to advance and gain control of Erseka and further advanced on Frashër and Korçë.\n\nBy early May, the Albanian authorities, being unable to suppress the movement in Northern Epirus, became willing to start discussions with the intervention of the International Commission. Thus, Prince William of Wied of Albania asked the Commission, which represented the Albanian government, to initiate negotiations. The latter, in order to avoid a major escalation of the armed conflicts with disastrous results, decided to intervene. On May 7, Zografos received a communication to initiate negotiations on a new basis and accepted the proposal. Thus, an armistice was ordered the next day.\n\nThe representatives of both sides met for negotiations in Sarandë, but the final negotiations took place in the nearby island of Corfu, Greece. Finally, on May 17, 1914, the representatives of Northern Epirus and Albania signed an agreement that granted the chief demands of the Epirotes and became known as the Protocol of Corfu. According to this agreement, Northern Epirus, which consisted of the regions surrounding the cities of Gjirokastër and Korçë would be an autonomous, fully self-governing part of Albania under the suzerainty of the Albanian prince.\n\nIn general the Protocol recognized the Greek character of the region and the Greek language acquired an official status there, next to the Albanian one. The main demands of the Northern Epirote government were accepted. However, a number of issues were not granted, in particurlar the extension of the area in which the Greek population would enjoy education in its native language in the regions around Vlorë and Durrës (in central Albania, to the north of Northern Epirus), the appointment of Greek Orthodox higher officials in the main towns of the autonomous area and the exemption from military service of the local population, even in time of war.\n\nHowever, the Protocol was never implemented due to political instability in Albania. On 27 October, after approval from the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered Northern Epirus. The Provisional Government of Northern Epirus formally ceased to exist, declaring that it accomplished its mission.\n\nIn 1916 due to the developments of World War I Italian and French troops evicted the Greek army from the area. In 1921 it was finally ceded to Albania, while the Albanian Prime Minister recognized a number of the Greek minority's rights, which were soon ignored. As a result, most of the Greek schools were forced to close and Greek education was allowed only in certain areas.\n\n"}

Jozef M.A. Janssen, a Dutch Egyptologist at Leiden University, was asked to publish a yearly list of titles with abstracts. The first volume appeared in 1948. Volumes 1 (1947)-30 (1976) were published by Brill, volumes 31 (1977)-35 (1981) by Aris & Phillips Ltd.\nAfter Janssen’s death in 1963, Dutch Egyptologist M.S.G.H. Heerma van Voss assumed the task of AEB Editor-in-Chief, with the help of a number of assistant editors. He was succeeded by Jac. J. Janssen (1967-1978), L.M.J. Zonhoven (1979-1984), and W. Hovestreydt (1984-2008).\nIn the 1980s, yearly volumes of \"Preliminary Egyptological Bibliography\" were also published.\nDue to budget cuts at Leiden University, the Netherlands Institute for the Near East (NINO) took up responsibility for the AEB in 1992. Volumes 36 (1982)-53 (2001) were published by NINO. Hovestreydt together with H.S. van den Berg developed a digital administration of the bibliographical information, which led to the publication in 2001 of the cd-rom \"Egyptological bibliography 1822-1997\" (which included the digitized information of C. Beinlich's \"Bibliographie Altägypten 1822-1947\"), and the \"AEB Online\" website in 2007.\n\nStarting from 2009, the AEB was transferred to Oxford and renamed Online Egyptological Bibliography. No more print volumes were published. In 2011, the German bibliography \"Aigyptos\" was incorporated.\n\n"}

{"id": "16089485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16089485", "title": "Regesta", "text": "Regesta\n\nPapal regesta are the copies, generally entered in special registry volumes, of the papal letters and official documents that are kept in the papal archives. The name is also used to indicate subsequent publications containing such documents, in chronological order, with summaries of their essential contents, for which English diplomatics use usually the term \"calendar\".\n\nThe growth of the correspondence of the Holy See is evident even by the end of the 2nd century. Probably from a very early date a copy was made of papal documents before their dispatch, and that the collection of these documents was preserved at the seat of the central administration of the Roman Church. At that time high officials of the Roman State administration, the imperial chancery, the Senate, the consuls, the provincial governments, had all official documents entered in such volumes and preserved in the archives. The books in which these documents were entered were called \"commentarii regesta\", the latter word from \"regerere\", to inscribe.\n\nThe existence of such papal regesta can be proved for the 4th century and the succeeding era. In his polemic with Rufinus (\"Apolog. adv. Rufinum\", III, xx), St. Jerome refers to the archives (\"chartarium\") of the Roman Church, where the letter of Pope Anastasius (399-401) on the controversy over the doctrines of Origen was preserved. There are also notices concerning the registration of papal letters in the documents of several popes of the 5th century. Thus Pope Zosimus in his letter of 22 Sept., 417, to the bishops of Africa refers to the fact that all the earlier negotiations with Coelestius had been examined at Rome (Coustant, \"Epist. Rom. Pontif.\", 955). Consequently, copies of the documents in question must have existed. From this time onwards it remained the fixed custom of the papal chancery to copy the official papers issued by it in registers.\n\nFrom the centuries previous to the pontificate of Innocent III (1199–1216) there remain only fragments of the registry volumes of the papal chancery and these in large part merely in later copies. Nearly all the volumes of the papal regesta up to the end of the 12th century have disappeared.\n\nThe most important fragments of this period that have been preserved are: nearly 850 letters, in three groups, of the Regesta of Pope Gregory I (590-604). An investigation proved that the original Regesta consisted of fourteen papyrus volumes, corresponding to the number of years of the pontificate, which were arranged according to indictions; that each of these volumes was divided into twelve parts, before each of which the name of the corresponding month was written. This indicates the plan of the earliest volumes of the papal Regesta. A manuscript of the Vatican archives contains letters of John VIII (872-882) from September 876 to the end of the pontificate. This is not an original register, but an 11th-century copy. Separate letters, fifty-five in number, belonging to the first four years of the pontificate of this pope, are in a manuscript of the 12th century in the British Museum (Ms. Add. 8874). The manuscript contains letters of Gelasius I (492-96), Pelagius I (556-561), Leo IV (847-55), John VIII (872-82), Stephen V (885-91), Alexander II (1061–73), and Urban II (1088–99). The study of the manuscript by Ewald [\"Neues Archiv\", V (1880), 275 sqq., 503 sqq.] led to important conclusions concerning the volumes of the Regesta. Another manuscript at Cambridge contains some seventy letters from the Regesta of Adrian IV (1154–59), Alexander III (1159–81), and Lucius III (1181–85) [see Löwenfeld in \"Neues Archiv\", X, 1885, 585 sqq.]. Again, large parts of the Regesta of Gregory VII (1073–85), namely 381 letters, are contained in a manuscript in the Vatican archives. This collection is also only an extract of the original Regesta. In it the letters are no longer arranged according to indictions, but according to the year of the pontificate. A fraction of the Regesta of the antipope Anacletus II (1130–38) containing thirty-eight letters has been preserved in a manuscript of Monte Cassino (Ewald in \"Neues Archiv\", III, 164 sqq.). Besides these collections of letters which have preserved fragments of the earliest papal Regesta, rich material is also to be found in the canonical collections of the Middle Ages. In part these collections go back directly or indirectly to the volumes of the Regesta of the papal archives, from which the authors of these collections, as Anselm of Lucca, and above all Deusdedit, gathered the greater part of their material.\n\nFrom Pope Innocent III onward the manuscript volumes of the papal Regesta still exist in the Vatican Archives.\n\nThe Regesta of the 13th century are beautifully written parchment volumes. Yet the most of these in their present form have been made from older volumes. How these older volumes, the real original Regesta, were planned cannot be decided. From the 14th century onward, registry volumes of paper were used for the entering of the copies. However, when the popes returned from Avignon to Rome, these paper Regesta were left at Avignon, and copies of them were made in parchment registry volumes that were brought to Rome. At a later era, the original Regesta volumes were also brought to the Vatican Archives so that there are two series in existence for the Avignon epoch of the 14th century. From the 14th century onwards the volumes of the Regesta were generally made of paper. Numerous investigations have been made by various scholars as to the arrangement of the volumes of the Regesta, the rules or customs observed in the entering of the separate pieces, as to the question of whether the draft or the finished letter was copied, and as to many other matters in diplomatics, without reaching very certain results. In the 13th century the letters were divided into \"Litteræ communes\" and \"Litteræ de curia\" or \"Curiales\", the latter dealing mostly with affairs of general importance. At a later date other headings (litteræ secretæ, litteræ de beneficiis) were also introduced. Besides the regular Regesta of the papal letters made in the papal chancery, there were similar Regesta of the papal letters executed since the 14th century in the Apostolic Camera. From about the middle of the 14th century the registers of petitions were also preserved, in which were entered, not the papal documents, but the memorials to the pope, in reply to which the papal documents were issued.\n\nAs collections of the official documents of the papal chancery, the Regesta are a very important historical authority. For convenience in historical investigation various scholars have published in chronological order all known papal documents of large periods, with brief summaries of the contents of the letters. The three greatest collections of this kind are:\n\n\nThe database \"Regesta Pontificum Romanorum online\" from the \"Göttinger Papsturkundenwerk\" will combine the several Regesta projects up to the year 1198.\n\nLetters of several popes taken from the volumes of the Regesta have been published by: Löwenfeld: \"Epistolæ Pontificum Romanorum ineditæ\" (Leipzig, 1885) taken from the manuscript at Cambridge; Rodenberg, \"Epistolæ sæc. XIII e Regestis Rom. Pont. selectæ\" (Berlin, 1883 —), in \"Mon. Germ. Hist.\" The Regesta of the letters of Gregory I were edited again by Ewald and Hartmann, \"Gregorii I Registrum epistolarum\" in \"Mon. Germ. Hist.\" (Berlin, 1891 —).\n\nThe letters of Gregory VII were edited by Jaffé, \"Monumenta Gregoriana\" in \"Bibliotheca Rerum Germanicarum\" (2 vols., Berlin, 1868). As early as 1591 the records of John VIII were published from the manuscript in the Vatican.

In this later series, besides the documents of general interest, they kept in view particularly those documents that bore on the history of France. For the later eras only the first numbers were published of the Regesta of Leo X (1513–21), edited by Cardinal Hergenröther (see under the different popes).\n\nIn addition a number of works have been issued or are in course of publication that contain Regesta from the Vatican Regesta of the 14th century, bearing on special questions or on the history of various countries and dioceses, e.g., Werunsky, \"Excerpts ex registris Clementis VI et Innocenti VI (Innsbruck, 1885); Ruezler, \"Vatikanische Akten zur deutschen Geschichte in der Zeit Ludwigs des Bayern\" (Munich, 1890).\n\n\n"}

PE Linde appeared for the appellant and BG van der Walt, SC, Attorney-General OFS, for the State. The case was heard on March 8, 1963. The appellant's attorney was DA Carroll, Johannesburg.\n\nIn an appeal from a conviction of culpable homicide on a charge of murder, it appeared that the trial judge had repeatedly directed the jury that they could not acquit the appellant, on his plea of self-defence, unless they came to the conclusion that a reasonable man in his situation would have feared that his life was in danger.\n\nThe court held that the trial judge should have directed the jury that the appellant would have been justified in shooting the deceased if he justifiably feared that he was about to suffer grievous bodily harm at his hands. The failure so to direct the jury was an irregularity which had prejudiced the appellant, because it appeared that the jury might have found that, even though he did not fear for his life, he most certainly feared very serious bodily harm when he was assaulted by the deceased. The appeal was accordingly allowed and the conviction and sentence set aside.\n\n\n"}

She joined the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in the mid-1980s and held its AWA World Women's Championship three times. In the late 1980s, she joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where she held the WWF Women's Championship. Also in the WWF, Martel continued to act as a manager to wrestlers such as Randy Savage, Ted DiBiase, and Shawn Michaels. She appeared in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the 1990s. In the latter, Martel acted as the manager for the tag team Harlem Heat. After leaving WCW, she made few wrestling related appearances until her death in 2007. She also appeared in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in September 2006 as a manager for Bobby Roode which ended up being her last televised wrestling appearance.\n\nMartel was first introduced to professional wrestling as a child, when her mother took her and her sister to shows in Mississippi. In 1974, Martel approached Grizzly Smith for advice on becoming a wrestler, but he questioned her conviction and told her to come back to him in five years when she was an adult. She eventually married her second husband and gave birth to a son named Jared, but she soon divorced her husband. During this time, she again became interested in becoming a professional wrestler and sought training from \"Mr. Personality\" Butch Moore in Memphis, Tennessee. She started wrestling as Sherri Martine, but decided she needed more training. She continued to train at The Fabulous Moolah's school, where Moolah changed her name to Sherri Martel and sent her to wrestle in Japan in 1981. Moolah claims that Martel frequented night clubs and liked to party, which resulted in Moolah kicking her out of the school.\n\nAfter leaving the school, she traveled back to Tennessee. In Memphis, she was managed by Jim Cornette. During a mixed battle royal, Martel suffered an injury that removed her from wrestling temporarily. She then worked as both a wrestler and manager for Pat Rose and Tom Prichard.\n\nAfter recovering, Larry Zbyszko helped her join the American Wrestling Association (AWA). She eventually debuted in the AWA and, on September 28, 1985, at \"SuperClash\" in Chicago, she defeated Candi Devine for the AWA World Women's Championship. She traded the belt with Devine, and on June 28, 1986, at \"Battle by the Bay,\" Martel defeated Devine to win the AWA World Women's Championship for a third and final time. Martel, however, only held the title briefly before vacating it.\n\nDuring this time, in addition to wrestling, Martel acted as the manager for the team of \"Playboy\" Buddy Rose and \"Pretty Boy\" Doug Somers, whom she managed to win the AWA World Tag Team Championship. Rose and Somers then engaged in a lengthy feud with The Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty), who defeated Rose and Somers for the tag team title on January 27, 1987, in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nAfter former AWA wrestler Jesse Ventura referred her to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), she debuted on July 24, 1987, defeating The Fabulous Moolah for the WWF Women's Championship. Renaming herself Sensational Sherri, she reigned as WWF Women's Champion for fifteen months before losing it to Rockin' Robin on October 8, 1988 in Paris, France. At the Survivor Series in 1987, Martel's team consisting of Martel, Women's World Tag Team Champions The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin), Dawn Marie, and Donna Christanello lost to The Fabulous Moolah's team consisting of Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki). When the WWF phased out its women's division in 1990, Martel remained with the company and turned her attention to managing male wrestlers.\n\nConcurrent with her reign as WWF Women's Champion, Martel made several appearances in costume as \"Peggy Sue,\" the girlfriend of The Honky Tonk Man, who was in the midst of a run as Intercontinental Champion. Her primary role was to irritate Honky's opponents—namely, Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage and Brutus \"the Barber\" Beefcake—and interfere in his matches.\n\nAfter WrestleMania V, Martel confronted Miss Elizabeth, manager of newly-dethroned former WWF World champion Randy Savage, during an interview, leading to a confrontation between the two in which Savage fired Elizabeth and repeatedly threatened to hit her. Martel then attacked Hulk Hogan from behind as he came to Elizabeth's rescue, leaving him open to a chair attack from Savage, Throughout the remainder of 1989, Martel and Savage feuded with Hogan and Elizabeth. At SummerSlam, Hogan and Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake defeated the team of Savage and Zeus. After the match, Elizabeth knocked out Martel with Martel's purse, and she, Hogan, and Beefcake cut Martel's hair.\n\nAt WrestleMania VI in 1990, Martel and Savage lost a mixed tag-team match against Sapphire and Dusty Rhodes after Elizabeth, who was in the corner of Sapphire and Rhodes, interfered and shoved Martel. During that same year, Martel and Savage appeared on \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\" with Robin Leach. During a steel cage match at Madison Square Garden, The Ultimate Warrior pulled off an escaping Martel's miniskirt to reveal matching black garter belts and lace underpants. Practically in tears, Martel raced back to the locker room. At WrestleMania VII, Savage lost a \"retirement match\" against The Ultimate Warrior, in which the loser would be forced (Kayfabe) to retire. After Savage lost the match, an irate Martel attacked Savage but was thrown from the ring by Elizabeth, who had been watching from the audience. Later on the WM7 card after she and Savage parted ways following the career match, Martel came to the ring to help \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase in his assault on an injured Rowdy Roddy Piper, following which she managed DiBiase until 1992.\n\nSubsequently, Martel began managing Shawn Michaels after Pat Patterson convinced Michaels to participate in the storyline. She also sang Michaels theme song called \"Sexy Boy\". As part of his gimmick, Michaels would admire himself in a full-length mirror before his matches. In 1992, before a match, his former partner Marty Jannetty grabbed the mirror and attempted to hit Michaels with it, but Michaels pulled Martel in front of him. After being hit with the mirror, she was absent from television until the Royal Rumble in January 1993. At the Rumble, she was in a neutral corner for the match between Michaels and Jannetty but eventually turned on Michaels during the match. Backstage, Michaels confronted her and Jannetty came to her rescue. The storyline, however, was cut short as Jannetty was released from the company in the midst of the feud. Martel spent the remainder of the year aligned with Tatanka, who aided her in her feud with Luna Vachon and Bam Bam Bigelow. She was released from the World Wrestling Federation during the summer.\n\nTowards the end of her time in the WWF, Martel participated in a WWF invasion angle in the USWA, reuniting with Savage. Martel would suffer a similar embarrassment to that which she had suffered at the hands of Warrior when she ran in the ring to aid Savage in a steel cage match in Memphis against his old enemy in the area, Jerry \"The King\" Lawler, but after accidentally knocking Savage from the ring, she had her dress yanked off by Lawler as she climbed the cage to escape.\n\nAfter her WWF release, Martel had a brief spell in Smoky Mountain Wrestling, siding with Tracy Smothers in a feud with Tammy Fytch, Brian Lee, as well as several intergender matches with Jim Cornette.\n\nShe began working in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 1993, managing Shane Douglas. Sherri turned on Douglas in a tag match with Brian Pillman, costing Douglas the match on behalf of Ric Flair. At November to Remember on November 13, Martel faced Malia Hosaka in a match.\n\nMartel signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1994. The original plan for her was to manage Kevin and Dave Sullivan against Missy Hyatt and The Nasty Boys, but after Hyatt was fired in February 1994, the proposed rivalry went on with no managers for either team.\n\nMartel made her debut on the April 23 edition of \"WCW Saturday Night\", under the name Sensuous Sherri. In an interview with Gene Okerlund, she said her goal was to find a man that can bring her the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. She was at ringside during at Slamboree on May 22, during the WCW World Heavyweight Championship match between Ric Flair and Barry Windham. On June 24, a title unification match took place at the \"Clash of the Champions XXVII\" between WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair and the WCW International World Heavyweight Champion Sting. Although she revealed in the beginning of the match she sided with Sting (including wearing his signature face paint), it turned out to be a double cross, as she sided with Flair, who won the match and unified the titles, double-teaming Sting, until the newly signed Hulk Hogan made the save.\n\nAt Bash at the Beach, Martel tried to help Flair to defeat Hogan in a match by giving him brass knuckles but failed. At the feud's climactic battle, a steel cage match at Halloween Havoc, Martel climbed the cage to aid Flair and in the process had her dress pulled off by Jimmy Hart, Hogan's manager, leaving her dangling from the cage in black lingerie.\n\nNext, Martel began managing Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) using the name Sister Sherri. She managed the team to seven WCW World Tag Team Championship reigns. In late 1994 (while still managing Harlem Heat in WCW), Martel made a return appearance in ECW managing Shane Douglas and Brian Pillman against Ron Simmons and 2 Cold Scorpio. Back in WCW, Martel had a brief on-screen romance with Col. Robert Parker until October 1996 when Harlem Heat fired him and Martel had a match with him at World War 3 in November. She continued to manage Harlem Heat until she got fired from the group on the July 7, 1997 edition of \"Nitro\".\n\nEarly in 1999, Martel competed in a mixed-tag team match for the Apocalypse Wrestling Federation's Heavyweight Championship, a title held predominately by men. Missy Hyatt pinned Martel to win the title. In October 1999, she appeared on the \"Heroes of Wrestling\" pay-per-view managing Greg Valentine in a match against George Steele. Also in 1999, she was awarded the AWA Superstars Women's Championship.\n\nIn 2000, she made three wrestling television appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The first was at the Souled Out 2000 pay-per-view event, watching at ringside along with other superstars, the Chris Benoit vs. Sid Vicious matchup for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The second was on the January 19, 2000 edition of \"WCW Thunder\" where she had a match with Madusa, which she lost. In her third and final appearance in World Championship Wrestling, she had a match with Mona, which she also lost.\n\nIn 2005, she took part in a World Wrestling Entertainment (formerly the WWF) storyline with Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle shortly before WrestleMania 21. She made a return to \"SmackDown!\", singing a parody of Michaels' theme song with Angle.\n\nShe was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Ted DiBiase in April 2006. Later that year, she worked for TNA Wrestling, taping a backstage vignette trying to offer her managerial services to \"free agent\" Bobby Roode that aired on the September 21, 2006 \"TNA Impact!\"; it was her last wrestling television appearance.\n\nBy 2003, she and her husband Robert Schrull lived in Tennessee, where she helped him renovate homes. She was married and divorced at least twice during her life, and Booker T gave her away at one of her weddings. She had one son.\n\nOn June 15, 2007, Martel died at her mother's residence in McCalla, Alabama, near Birmingham. She was 49 years old. On September 11, 2007, homicide investigators in Tuscaloosa, Alabama released the toxicology report stating that she died of an overdose with multiple drugs in her system, including high amounts of oxycodone. She was cremated after her death.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "938656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=938656", "title": "Statement (computer science)", "text": "Statement (computer science)\n\nIn computer programming, a statement is a syntactic unit of an imperative programming language that expresses some action to be carried out. A program written in such a language is formed by a sequence of one or more statements. A statement may have internal components (e.g., expressions).\n\nMany imperative languages (e.g. C) make a distinction between statements and definitions, with a statement only containing executable code and a definition instantiating an identifier, while an expression evaluates to a value only. A distinction can also be made between simple and compound statements; the latter may contain statements as components.\n\nThe following are some of the major generic kinds of statements, pseudocoded. These pseudocoded statements have an immediate corresponding syntax in any typical imperative language like \nPascal, C, Fortran etc.:\n\n\n\nThe appearance of statements shapes the look of programs. Programming languages are characterized by the type of statements they use (e.g. the curly brace language family). Many statements are introduced by identifiers like \"if\", \"while\" or \"repeat\". Often statement keywords are reserved such that they cannot be used as names of variables or functions. Imperative languages typically use special syntax for each statement, which looks quite different from function calls. Common methods to describe the syntax of statements are Backus–Naur form and syntax diagrams.\n\nSemantically many statements differ from subroutine calls by their handling of parameters. Usually an actual subroutine parameter is evaluated once before the subroutine is called. This contrasts to many statement parameters that can be evaluated several times (e.g. the condition of a while loop) or not at all (e.g. the loop body of a while loop). Technically such statement parameters are call-by-name parameters. Call-by-name parameters are evaluated when needed (see also lazy evaluation). When call-by-name parameters are available a statement like behaviour can be implemented with subroutines (see Lisp). For languages without call-by-name parameters the semantic description of a loop or conditional is usually beyond the capabilities of the language. Therefore, standard documents often refer to semantic descriptions in natural language.\n\nIn most languages, statements contrast with expressions in that statements do not return results and are executed solely for their side effects, while expressions always return a result and often do not have side effects at all. Among imperative programming languages, Algol 68 is one of the few in which a statement can return a result. In languages that mix imperative and functional styles, such as the Lisp family, the distinction between expressions and statements is not made: even expressions executed in sequential contexts solely for their side effects and whose return values are not used are considered 'expressions'. In purely functional programming, there are no statements; everything is an expression.\n\nThis distinction is frequently observed in wording: a statement is \"executed\", while an expression is \"evaluated\". This is found in the codice_17 and codice_18 functions found in some languages: in Python both are found, with codice_17 applied to statements and codice_18 applied to expressions.\n\nMost languages have a fixed set of statements defined by the language, but there have been experiments with extensible languages that allow the programmer to define new statements.\n\n\n"}

Oddly enough, the prospective buyer is a young German. The two of them start a conversation about history and present-day Italy.\n\nThe Creation of Meaning is the second feature film by Simone Rapisarda Casanova. It is set and shot in the Apuan Alps, the landscape once crossed by the Gothic Line. The film is an experimental hybrid fiction-documentary inspired by Jorge Luis Borges's short story The Aleph. Rapisarda Casanova’s stylistic hallmarks include his elliptical, metacinematic approach to storytelling, his unconventional use of non-actors, his use of natural light and colour inspired by renaissance paintings, along with meticulously-composed static single-takes and diegetic soundscapes. His approach to filmmaking is mostly process-driven, after careful research of the thematic base. The intent behind such stylistic and methodological choices is to create a cinematic occasion where people and places may reveal their deepest nature.\n\nThe Creation of Meaning won the Best Emerging Director award at the Locarno Film Festival in 2014; in 2015 it won the Best of Festival award at the Ann Arbor Film Festival and was acquired and released theatrically by the Museum of Modern Art, New York and by the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC.

The description \"bible of cricket\" was first used in the 1930s by Alec Waugh in a review for the \"London Mercury\". In October 2013, an all-time Test World XI was announced to mark the 150th anniversary of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\".\n\nIn 1998, an Australian edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" was launched. It ran for eight editions.\n\nIn 2012, an Indian edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" was launched (dated 2013).\n\n\"Wisden\" was founded in 1864 by the English cricketer John Wisden (1826–84) as a competitor to Fred Lillywhite's \"The Guide to Cricketers\". Its annual publication has continued uninterrupted to the present day, making it the longest running sports annual in history. The sixth edition was the first published under its current title; the first five were published as \"The Cricketer<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Almanack\", with the apostrophe before the \"s\".\n\nCharles Pardon, with George Kelly King, founded the Cricket Reporting Agency (CRA) in 1880. From Pardon's becoming editor of \"Wisden\" in 1887, the editor was nearly always a CRA partner and the CRA was responsible for the editorial production of the \"Almanack\", until in 1965 it merged with the Press Association (PA).\n\n\"Wisden\" was acquired and published by Robert Maxwell's publishing conglomerate, Macdonald, in the 1970s. Cricket fan Sir John Paul Getty, Jr., bought the company, John Wisden & Co., in 1993 and in December 2008 it was sold to A&C Black, which is owned by Bloomsbury. The company presented the Wisden Trophy, for Test matches between England and West Indies, in 1963 to celebrate its 100th edition.\n\nIn 2013, a history of \"Wisden\" was published: \"The Little Wonder: The Remarkable History of Wisden\", by Robert Winder (). \"The Little Wonder\" was John Wisden's nickname.\n\n\"Wisden\" is a small-paged but a very thick book (over 1,500 pages in modern editions) with a distinctive bright yellow cover that it has carried since the 75th edition in 1938. Prior to that, covers varied between yellow, buff and salmon pink. That edition was also the first to display the famous woodcut of two cricketers, by Eric Ravilious, on its cover. It is published each April, just before the start of the English domestic cricket season. Since 2003 the woodcut has been replaced as the main feature of the front cover by a photograph of a current cricketer, but still appears albeit in a much reduced size.\n\nIt is produced in both hardcover and softcover versions. Since 2006, a larger format edition has been published on an experimental basis. This is said to be in response to requests from readers who find the print size of the standard edition hard to read. It is around twice the traditional size and was published in a limited edition of 5,000. It is not a large print book as such, as the print will still be of a size found in many standard books.\n\nFrom 2011 an Epub version, \"The Shorter Wisden\", has been available in online bookstores. Described by the publishers as a \"distillation of what's best in its bigger brother\", it includes the Notes by the Editor, all the articles, reviews and obituaries and the reports on all England's Test matches for the year in question. Excluded are the statistics and other cricket reports contained within the \"Almanack\" proper.\nThe format has changed markedly over the years. The first edition had only 112 pages yet found space to cover the dates of battles in the English Civil War, the winners of The Oaks and the rules of quoiting.\n\nThe contents of a contemporary edition include the following sections:\n\nAround a hundred pages of articles on cricketing topics, including the introductory \"Notes by the Editor\", which address often controversial cricket issues and always provoke discussion in the cricketing world.\n\nThe traditional Wisden Cricketers of the Year awards, which date back to 1889, and the Wisden Leading Cricketer of the World award, started in 2004.\n\nTraditionally the main source for key statistics about the game, although it has never attempted to be comprehensive.

There are also details of meetings held by official bodies, including their major decisions, as well as articles about the Duckworth–Lewis method and Powerplays. The laws have been omitted from the most recent editions.\n\nThis section includes the Chronicle (noteworthy events from the previous year), reviews of other cricket books published in the year, noteworthy retirements and the highly regarded obituaries section among others.\n\nJohn Arlott wrote the Books section from its inception in the 1950 edition until the 1992 edition, just before he died. Beginning with the 1993 edition the Books section has been written by a different person each year, often someone \"with a literary reputation first and a separate enthusiasm for cricket\". The first such reviewer was J. L. Carr, and others have included Sebastian Faulks (1997) and Leslie Thomas (1998).\n\nAn award for the Wisden Book of the Year was inaugurated in the 2003 edition. The winners have been:\n\nThis section contains fixtures for the forthcoming international and English domestic season, the international schedule for the upcoming seven years and the Index of Unusual Occurrences featuring quirky cricketing stories.

The majority involve match reports for the various fixtures recorded each year, but also biographies, reviews and opinion. Many great cricket writers have written for \"Wisden\", along with many great cricketers. Neville Cardus contributed many notable essays and for many years John Arlott was responsible for the book reviews.\n\nSince 1902 (with the occasional exception) \"Wisden\" has honoured five cricketers for their outstanding achievements over the previous year. Further details, with a full list of recipients of the award, can be found at Wisden Cricketers of the Year.\n\nAt least two indices to \"Wisden\" have been published:\n\nAn index from 1985 onwards is available in pdf form on the \"Wisden\" web site.\n\nA number of anthologies of articles from \"Wisden\" have been published. These include:\n\nFor the first 32 years of its existence the \"Almanack\" was only published in softback form, in a paper cover that varied in colour through the years between shades of pink, yellow and buff. From the 33rd (1896) edition onwards hardback copies became available at twice the price of the softback.\n\nIn 1889 the \"Almanack\" published its first photoplate, commissioned to accompany the Editor's nomination of six great Bowlers of the Year. From then on a photoplate appeared each year up to and including 1915. The plates were attached to an un-numbered page in the \"Almanack\" and had a tissue protector. They continued to show a number of selected players of the year except in 1896, when W G Grace was the only subject, and in 1913, when the 50th edition published no selections but celebrated John Wisden himself. After a two-year hiatus during World War 1 the plate reappeared in 1918, but as a mechanically printed image depicting five School Bowlers of the Year. The image in the 1919 edition continued to reflect wartime exigencies with its five Public School Cricketers of the Year before normal service resumed in 1920 with five Batsmen of the Year. From then on, with four exceptions (see Wisden Cricketers of the Year), the norm was to include an image of five Cricketers of the Year. It was not until 1938 that other photographs were introduced.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1939 the softback editions of the \"Almanack\" contained a cricket bat bookmark attached by the blade to the inside of the spine with yellow string. The bat handle of the bookmark is easily lost and softbacks with entirely intact bookmarks command a price premium.\n\nIn 1938 the \"Almanack\" underwent some significant style, design and material changes under the supervision of Robert Henry Harling. He introduced a new typeface and new designs for the front covers of both the softback and hardback editions. A yellow linen cover featuring the iconic woodcut by Eric Ravilious replaced the paper wrapper of the softback edition – a reason why softbacks from this time onwards are often referred to as \"linens\" even though they changed to a cloth-effect card binding in 1957. The design of the softback from 1938 onwards is probably the one most associated with the word \"Wisden\" in the mind of the general public.\n\nThere was a change to the orientation of the gilt lettering on the spines of hardbacks from 1941 to 1948. This was probably required by, and then a relict of, the slimness of the volumes published during World War 2. Excepting the 1963 centenary softback, the external appearance of both types of the \"Almanack\" then remained substantially unchanged until 1965 when the hardback was issued with a dust jacket. This was printed on yellow paper with the same design as the softback, giving a uniformity of appearance to both formats.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1978 the woodcut and text elements of the softback covers and the hardback dust jackets were printed in a variety of colours before reverting to black on yellow from 1979 onwards. Since that time some other changes have occurred to the style, design and materials:\n\n\nMinor changes of style have taken place throughout the \"Almanack\"s history, and are documented in a collector's guide that was updated and reprinted in 2011.\n\nDue to their rarity the early editions of \"Wisden\", and editions published during the two World Wars, are rare and expensive. However, every edition up to 1946 is also available in facsimile form.\n\nThe first facsimile set was printed by Billing & Sons in 1960. Approximately 150 softback copies were produced of each year from 1864 to 1878 and made available either as part of a set or as singles. The facsimiles are clearly marked with an entry in capital letters at the bottom of the title page: \"Facsimile edition 1960 made and printed in Great Britain by Billing and Sons Ltd., Guildford and London\".\n\nLowe and Brydone produced another print run of the first 15 years in 1974. The run was limited again to 150 softback sets. These facsimiles are marked with an entry in capital letters at the bottom of the title page: \"Second facsimile edition made and printed in Great Britain by Lowe and Brydone (Printers) Limited\".\n\nIn 1991 John Wisden & Co Ltd produced its own facsimile set in a distinctive yellow box. This again comprised editions from 1864 to 1878 inclusive and was limited to 1000 sets. The individual books are not strictly facsimiles, and cannot be mistaken for originals, because although they include a copy of the original covers they are hardbound in red boards with \"\"WISDEN\" FACSIMILE\" in gilt on the front and the set number – \"No. X of 1000\" – on the back. Internally there is also an entry to the effect that the editions are facsimiles at the bottom of each title page: \"This facsimile edition is published in 1991 by John Wisden & Co. Ltd. and printed by The Eastern Press Ltd., Reading\".\n\nIn recent years a more extensive range of facsimiles has been produced by the Willows Publishing Company Ltd. As of early 2014, softback and hardback editions up to and including 1946 have been published. Like the \"Wisden\" facsimile set, the Willows softback facsimiles up to 1937 are hardbound, in tan cloth with gilt embossing, but from 1938 onwards they are true facsimiles with yellow linen covers. The hardback editions are also true facsimiles, with dark brown covers upon which the original gilt embossing is reproduced. Internally all Willows editions are identified as reprints at the base of the title page and limited edition numbers, where applicable, are also marked on the binding or cover.\n\nThe first three facsimile sets reproduced the wrong back cover for the 1878 edition – they incorrectly showed a list of articles supplied by John Wisden & Co. The Willows facsimile contains the correct advertisement, for a book on Oxford and Cambridge cricket matches from 1827 to 1876.\n\nTo celebrate the 150th edition, a facsimile of the 1864 edition was offered by John Wisden & Co as an incentive for those who subscribed to both the 2013 and 2014 editions. The facsimile offer was repeated in 2014 for those willing to subscribe to the \"Almanack\" by direct debit. This is not a true facsimile as the back cover does not reproduce the \"List of Articles\" of the original, but instead on the inside there is an advertisement for \"Wisden\" reprints from the Willows Publishing Company and on the back a celebration of 150 years of \"Wisden\". At the bottom of the back cover information is provided about the reprint: \"This reprint of the first edition of \"Wisden\" was produced in 2013 for the publisher, John Wisden & Co, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. Printed and bound by MPG Books.\"\n\nFacsimile dust jackets are available for editions of \"Wisden\" from 1965 to 2003 to replace those that have been lost or damaged. They are also offered from 2004 onward as \"traditional covers\" that can be substituted for the original photo dust jackets. Supplied by \"Wisden\"s \"official dust jacket supplier\", these jackets are laminated and are printed in black on yellow (unlike the original jackets issued with the editions from 1965 to 1978 that incorporated colour elements). Replacement dust jackets are also clearly distinguishable from the originals as they are marked on the back cover with the words \"REPLACEMENT DUST JACKET\".\n\nThe same supplier offers traditional design dust jackets for editions from 1946 to 1964. Although these mimic the appearance of the softback covers they are not true facsimiles as the original hardback editions were never issued with dust jackets.\n\nThe size of \"Wisden\" print runs is of considerable interest to collectors as rarity has a very strong influence on the value of individual editions.\n\nThe most reliable, or rather most widely quoted, source of information on print runs is an article by Leslie Gutteridge titled \"A History of \"Wisden\"\" published in the 1963 \"Almanack\". In this article the writer states that it had proved impossible to trace any printing orders earlier than 1936, having earlier mentioned that records had been lost during the Second World War as a result of two attacks on the publisher and Wisden's Mortlake factory.\n\nDespite the lack of early records Gutteridge notes that editions from 1889 to 1901, except 1896 and 1900, ran to two impressions (\"the word \"impression\" rather than \"edition\" is used throughout this section to avoid confusion with Wisden's use of \"edition\" in the book's title\"). He also notes in passing the rarity of the 1875 edition, though \"not ... so scarce as the first issue of 1864\", without providing specific details.\n\nIt is for the years from 1936 onwards that Gutteridge puts numbers to the print runs, providing either combined figures, or a breakdown of softback and/or hardback numbers, for each year to 1949:\n\nAfter 1949 he notes that numbers diminished, although at the time he wrote the article sales of the softback and hardback editions were still 11,000 and 10,000 respectively. It is likely that these figures were greatly exceeded in the centenary year as the 1963 edition ran to three impressions.\n\nIn more recent years sales of the 2006 edition exceeded 50,000 in total. The size of the print run was based on the publisher's belief that England's successful Ashes campaign the previous summer would attract considerable public interest.\n\nAlthough unsupported by any reliable documentation, it is almost certain that print runs were reduced during the First World War. The 1916 edition, also containing as it does the obituary of W G Grace, is the most expensive 20th century \"Wisden\".\n\nThe smallest recent print runs are believed to be for the years 1969 to 1971.\n\nCollecting \"Wisden\"s is a popular activity among cricket followers, and early editions command high prices. The first edition, only 112 pages long, sold for one shilling. Rare copies of the early editions can sell for thousands of pounds.\n\nAlthough devoting most of its pages to a survey of the contents of Wisden from 1864 to 2010, the last 44 pages of \"The Wisden Collector's Guide\" contains a significant amount of information of interest and practical use to the collector. \n\nThe two main UK-based on-line resources for \"Wisden\" collectors are the Wisdens.org (www.wisden.guru) and \"Wisden\" Collectors Club websites (see External Links). Facilities offered by the former are free of charge and open to all visitors (although its forum requires registration) while the latter charges a nominal annual membership fee for access to its main site.\n\nA \"Wisden\" archive is maintained by ESPNCricinfo (see External Links), offering access to some features, articles and international scores from the first edition onwards. The article \"A History of \"Wisden\"\" prepared for the 1963 centenary edition is likely to be of most interest to collectors who do not have access to the original volume.\n\nA combination of rarity (perceived or known), condition, completeness and originality determines the price a collector is willing to pay for any given edition. Rarity arguably has the strongest influence on value as editions known to be very rare (e.g. those published in the periods when paper restrictions applied during both World Wars) are very much more expensive than comparable editions from the surrounding decades. Editions such as the 1916 containing the obituary and career details of W. G. Grace; 1934, detailing the 'Bodyline' series of 1932–33; 1949, the Australian 'Invincibles' tour of 1948; 1965, the first to have a yellow dust jacket: All are rare and expensive for specific reasons.\n\n\n"}

It is operated by OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. The subscribing member libraries collectively maintain WorldCat's database, the world's largest bibliographic database. OCLC makes WorldCat itself available free to libraries, but the catalog is the foundation for other subscription OCLC services (such as resource sharing and collection management).\n\nOCLC was founded in 1967 under the leadership of Fred Kilgour. That same year, OCLC began to develop the union catalog technology that would later evolve into WorldCat; the first catalog records were added in 1971.\n\nIn 2003, OCLC began the \"Open WorldCat\" pilot program, making abbreviated records from a subset of WorldCat available to partner web sites and booksellers, to increase the accessibility of its subscribing member libraries' collections. In 2006, it became possible to search WorldCat directly at its website. In 2007, WorldCat Identities began providing pages for 20 million \"identities\", predominantly authors and persons who are the subjects of published titles.\n\nIn December 2017, WorldCat contained over 400 million bibliographic records in 491 languages, representing over 2.6 billion physical and digital library assets, and the WorldCat persons dataset (mined from WorldCat) included over 100 million people.\n\nWorldCat operates on a batch processing model rather than a real-time model. That is, WorldCat records are synchronized at intermittent intervals with the underlying library catalogs instead of real-time or every day. Consequently:\n\nAs an alternative, WorldCat allows participating institutions to add direct links from WorldCat to their own catalog entries for a particular item, which enables the user to determine its real-time status. However, this still requires users to open multiple Web pages, each pointing to a different OPAC with its own distinctive user interface design (which places item status in a different portion of the Web browser display), until they can locate a catalog entry that shows the item is currently available at a particular library.\n\n\n\n"}
