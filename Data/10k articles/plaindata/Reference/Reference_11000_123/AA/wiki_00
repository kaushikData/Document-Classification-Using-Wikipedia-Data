Built in 1816, it is one of the oldest buildings in the village of Moodus, and a fine example of Federal period architecture. The house, now owned and operated by Connecticut Landmarks, has displays which showcase how the Industrial Revolution changed the daily life of American families. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\n\nThe Amasa Day House occupies a prominent location at the northwest end of the Moodus village green, on of land that are mostly screened from the nearby state highway by trees. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Corner pilasters rise to a shallow entablature, with modillion blocks in the eaves. The side gable ends are pedimented, with half-round windows at the center. The main entrance is sheltered by a gabled portico; it is flanked by pilasters and topped by a half-oval transom window. Late 19th-century ells extend to the rear of the original main block.\n\nThe house was constructed in 1816 for farmer Colonel Julius Chapman, his wife Frances, and their four daughters. After his death, Amasa Day purchased the property, but later sold off parcels of land as he focused more on his roles as an insurance agent and banker. The house was subsequently inherited by Day's daughter and son-in-law Katherine and Eugene Chaffee, who worked for the New York Net and Twine Company, one of several twine factories in Moodus. Their son was Dr. Amasa Day Chaffee, a well-known art photographer.\n\nThe house was donated to Connecticut Landmarks in 1967, however it is not currently open to the public. An investigation by the attorney general's office into their alleged neglect of the property is ongoing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15642055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15642055", "title": "Appartement du roi", "text": "Appartement du roi\n\nThe appartement du roi or King's Apartment is the suite of rooms in the Palace of Versailles that served as the living quarters of Louis XIV. Overlooking the Marble Court (\"cour de marbre\"), these rooms are situated in the oldest part of the chateau in rooms originally designated for use by the queen in Louis XIII's chateau. Owing largely to the discomfort of the \"grand appartement du roi\" and to the construction of the Hall of Mirrors, Louis XIV began to remodel these rooms for his use shortly after the death of Maria Theresa in 1684. The \"appartement du roi\" evolved to become the everyday working quarters for Louis XV and Louis XVI.\n\nInitially, the \"appartement du roi\" consisted of a suite of eight rooms that issued from the Queen's Staircase (\"escalier de la reine\"). The number was reduced to seven after 1701 and to six in 1755.\n\nThe vestibule is paneled in marble and lighted by two windows that opened onto the \"cour royale\". In 1701, in order to provide more light to the staircase, the south wall opposite the windows was opened, thus creating a loggia from the vestibule. During the latter part of Louis XIV's reign, the Queen's staircase and the vestibule served as entrance to the \"appartement du roi\", the \"grand appartement de la reine\", and the apartment of Madame de Maintenon.\n\nThe salle des gardes du roi, served to house the \"Garde du corps du roi\" – the King's Body Guard. The early decor of this room included walls clad in tooled gilt leather and a battle scene by Joseph Parrocel, \"The Battle of Leuze, 18 September 1691\", hung over the fireplace. Two large chandeliers emblazoned with the king's monogram complemented the decor. The utilitarian nature of the room was evidenced by the wooden benches, camp beds, and folding screens used by the guards stationed in the room. On Mondays, a table, dressed with a gold-fringed velvet rug, would be placed in this room, at which Louis XIV would personally accept petitions presented to him by his subjects.\n\nThe première antichambre or salon du grand couvert (also known during the reign of Louis XIV as \"la salle ou le roy soupe\"), opened with three windows onto the \"cour de marbre\" (north) and with three windows onto the \"cour de la reine\" (south). The decoration of the room consisted of battle scenes by Joseph Parrocel with the \"Battle of Arbela\" being displayed over the mantelpiece. After the death of the queen and the dauphine, the room served for those occasions during which Louis XIV dined alone in public. For the \"grand couvert\", a table with a single armchair was dressed before the fireplace. The wall opposite the fireplace originally contained a tribune for musicians, but this was suppressed in the 18th century.\n\nThe end of one of the more scandalous events in Versailles history during the Sun King's reign transpired in this room. In 1691, the fringe from the portieres in the Salon de Mars and part of the embroidered bed cover from the bed in the Salon de Mercure were stolen. Toward the service of dessert, a bundle was thrown through one of the windows facing the \"cour de marbre\" and landed on the king's table. Louis XIV's only comment, \"I think that those are my fringes.\"\n\nThe salon de l'œil de bœuf or Antechamber of the Œil-de-Bœuf was formed in 1701 by combining two adjacent rooms, the \"deuxième antichambre\" and \"chambre du roi\". The \"salon de l'œil de bœuf\" became the main antechamber to the King's Bedroom, which was also created that year (see next section).\n\nTaking its name from the \"œil de bœuf\" (oval) window located in the south cove of the ceiling, the \"salon de l'œil de bœuf\" features a gilt-stucco running frieze that decorated the cove of the room's ceiling and features a trellis-work background on which are groups of dancing putti. It is the decoration of the cove that heralds a transition from the formalistic style that was used in the decoration of the grand appartement du roi and the Hall of Mirrors to a more relaxed style that anticipated the \"style Louis XV\". Louis XIV spared no expense in decorating this room. Mirrors, \"The Fainting of Ester\" and \"Judith with the head of Holofernes\" by Veronese hung as pendants, and gilt furniture all contributed to making this one of the most sumptuous rooms in the \"appartement du roi\".\n\nThe former two rooms, the \"deuxième antichambre\" and the \"chambre du roi\", were earlier part of the apartment of the queen, but in 1684, after the death of Marie-Thérèse d'Autriche, Louis XIV attached these rooms to his apartment. The \"deuxième antichambre\" served as waiting room for courtiers waiting to attend the king's \"lever\" in the \"chambre du roi\" and was also known as the \"antichambre des Bassans\" on account of the number of paintings by the northern Italian artist, Jacopo Bassano, that were displayed on the walls. Over the mantelpiece, the famed \"\"Noli me tangere\"s\" by Lambert Sustris was displayed.\n\nPaintings from the Antichambre des Bassans and the Salon de l'œil de bœuf\nThe chambre de Louis XIV (or King's Bedchamber) was constructed in 1701 on the site of the former \"salon du roi\" (or State Drawing Room), which dated from the time of Louis XIII. This room underwent a number of modifications during the reign of Louis XIV, most notably in 1678 when the three western windows facing the terrace became archways opening into the Hall of Mirrors (constructed beginning that year), for which the room became a kind of appendage. A \"avant-corps\" was added to the exterior of the eastern facade facing the Marble Court, with three bays opening onto a gilt wrought-iron balcony overlooking the courtyard, and the top part of the room corresponding to the attic storey of the \"avant-corps\".\n\nWhen in 1684 Louis XIV moved into the adjacent room to the south (the \"chambre du roi\"), this central room behind the facade of the \"avant-corps\" was designated as the \"salon du roi\" or the \"salon où le roi s'habille\" (\"the room in which the king dresses\"). For 17 years, it served as venue for the ceremonies that surrounded the life of the king, such as the \"lever\" and the \"coucher\". When the \"chambre de Louis XIV\" was established in 1701, the archways to the Hall of Mirrors were sealed off, and the room became the ideological as well as physical focal point of the palace. The king died in this room on 1 September 1715. Later, Louis XV and Louis XVI would continue to use it for the \"lever\" and the \"coucher\". On 6 October 1789, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and the Dauphin appeared on the balcony before the mob that forced the royal family to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris.\n\nPaintings in the \"Chambre de Louis XIV\nAs a measure of economy, Louis XIV retained much of the decor of the \"salon du roi\" in the decoration of the \"chambre de Louis XIV\". The over-door paintings included \"The Portrait of Francisco de Moncada\" and a \"Self-portrait\" the two by Anthony van Dyck, \"Saint John the Baptist\" by Caravaggio, and \"Mary Magdalene\" by Guido Reni. Domenichino's \"Saint Cecilia\" was placed in the cornice setting of the south wall above the fireplace and the artist's \"King David playing the harp\" hung as pendant opposite on the north wall.\n\nThe western wall of the room became the wall of the alcove – the area of the room separated by a balustrade in which the bed was located. The decoration of the alcove, with the ornaments of the agrafe and volutes as well as the trelliswork sculpture, anticipate in many respects anticipates the \"style Régence\" that was in vogue between 1715-1723. Crowning the bed is Nicolas Coustou's relief sculpture, \"France Triumphant\", which is complemented by two relief sculptures of \"Fame\" by François Lespingola located in the pendentives of the arch.\n\nThe present brocade on the walls of the alcove and for the bed has been rewoven as part of the initiative of the Fifth Republic to restore Versailles. The original alcove and bed hangings were restored in 1736; and, in 1785, Louis XVI ordered the brocade burned from which he obtained over 60 kilograms of gold. The present hanging, while accurate for the period, are not a reproduction of the brocaded that originally hung in the chambre de Louis XIV. Owing to lack of archival information when the project was undertaken, it was decided to use the pattern for hangings of the \"tenture d'hiver\" for the queen's bedroom. Only after the project was underway were the original designs found; as the part of the project had been completed, it was decided to use the queen's \"tenture d'hiver\".\n\nThe cabinet de conseil came into being as a council chamber upon the construction of the Salon of War, which occupied site of the Salon de Jupiter, Louis's previous council chamber. Initially called \"cabinet du roi\" from 1684, with the remodeling of the apartment that occurred in 1701, this room received a new decor that featured walls paneled with mirrors. With the redecoration, the room was rechristened \"cabinet des glaces\". In spite of the luxury of mirrors, this room was furnished in a utilitarian manner. In addition to the velvet covered council table, there were three armchairs and 12 folding stools and a daybed, which Louis XIV used in 1686 as a necessity while suffering from an anal fistula and the surgery that removed it.\n\nOf all the rooms of the \"appartement du roi\", this room perhaps best expressed the personal tastes of Louis XIV. In addition to the collection of gems, there were works by Nicolas Poussin and Giovanni Lanfranco on the walls as well as Harpsichord with a painted case. The personal nature of this room was offset by the fact that this was the room in which Louis XIV governed France. Councils were held here, writers who extolled the \"gloire\" of the Sun King were received here, and private audiences most often occurred in this room.\n\nThe last room of the \"appartement du roi\" was the \"cabinet des termes\" – due to the decor that featured 20 Hermes – also called the \"cabinet des perruques\", as this was the room in which Louis XIV's wigs were stored. In addition to the gilt Hermes that decorated the wall, the doors were covered with mirrors. The room served as a changing room for the king, where he would change his shirt, wig, and hat as many as four times a day. In the evening, this room would be where Louis XIV would gather with his children, other members of his family, and selected courtiers.\n\nThe \"cabinet des glaces\" and the \"cabinet des perruques\" disappeared in 1755 when Louis XV ordered the enlargement and redecoration of the council chamber. This is the room that is seen today.\n\nIn 1748, in order to accommodate the newly constructed \"cabinet du roi\" on the 3rd floor, Louis XV had the ceiling of the cabinet de glaces lowered by about a meter. The new dimension to the room necessitated a complete redecoration of the room. The following year, a new fireplace was installed and the one dating from the time of Louis XIV and was sent to Compiègne. In 1755, during the installation of a terrace in the \"cour des cerfs\", Louis XV decided to enlarge the council room by incorporating the cabinet des perruques. This larger room was designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel with the paneling sculpted by Jules-Antoine Rousseau. The panels were sculpted with symbols appropriate to governance: trophies of peace and war, attributes of the army, navy, justice, and the insignia of the monarchy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "555979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=555979", "title": "Auto-antonym", "text": "Auto-antonym\n\nAn auto-antonym or autantonym, also called a contronym or contranym, is a word with multiple meanings (senses) of which one is the reverse of another. For example, the word \"cleave\" can mean \"to cut apart\" or \"to bind together\". This phenomenon is called enantiosemy, enantionymy or antilogy (\"enantio-\" means \"opposite\"). An enantiosemic term is necessarily polysemic.\n\nThe terms \"autantonym\" and \"contronym\" were coined by Joseph Twadell Shipley in 1960 and Jack Herring in 1962, respectively. An auto-antonym is alternatively called an antagonym, Janus word (after the Roman god with two faces), enantiodrome, self-antonym, antilogy, or addad (Arabic, singular didd).\n\nSome pairs of contronyms are true homographs, i.e., distinct words with different etymology which happen to have the same form. For instance \"cleave\" \"separate\" is from Old English \"clēofan\", while \"cleave\" \"adhere\" is from Old English \"clifian\", which was pronounced differently. The King James Bible often uses \"let\" in the sense of \"forbid\", a meaning which is now uncommon, and which is derived from the Old English verb \"lettan\" 'hinder, delay, impede, oppress', as opposed to the meaning \"allow\", which is derived from the Old English verb \"lǣtan\" 'leave, allow, let on lease (etc.)'. Still, the alternate meaning of \"let\" can be found today in the legal phrase \"without let or hindrance\" and in ball games such as tennis, squash, table tennis, and racquetball.\n\nOther contronyms are a form of polysemy, but where a single word acquires different and ultimately opposite definitions. For example, \"sanction\"—\"permit\" or \"penalize\"; \"bolt\" (originally from crossbows)—\"leave quickly\" or \"fix/immobilize\"; \"fast\"—\"moving rapidly\" or \"unmoving\". Some English examples result from nouns being verbed in the patterns of \"add <noun> to\" and \"remove <noun> from\"; e.g. \"dust\", \"seed\", \"stone\". Denotations and connotations can drift or branch over centuries. An apocryphal story relates how Charles II (or sometimes Queen Anne) described St Paul's Cathedral (using contemporaneous English) as \"awful, pompous, and artificial,\" with the meaning (rendered in modern English) of \"awe-inspiring, majestic, and ingeniously designed.\" Negative words such as \"bad\" and \"sick\" sometimes acquire ironic senses referring to traits that are impressive and admired, if not necessarily positive (\"that outfit is bad as hell\"; \"lyrics full of sick burns\").\n\nSome contronyms result from differences in varieties of English. For example, to \"table\" a bill means \"to put it up for debate\" in British English, while it means \"to remove it from debate\" in American English (where British English would have \"shelve\"). To \"barrack\" for anyone in Australian English is to loudly demonstrate your support, while it expresses disapproval and contempt in American English and British English.\n\nSome words contain simultaneous opposing or competing meanings in the same context, rather than alternative meanings in different contexts; examples include blend words such as \"coopetition\" (meaning a murky blend of cooperation and competition), \"frenemy\" (meaning a murky blend of friend and enemy), \"interdependence\", \"glocalization\" etc. These are not usually classed as contronyms, but they share the theme of containing opposing meanings.\n\nAuto-antonyms exist in many languages, as the following examples show.\n\nIn Latin, \"sacer\" has the double meaning \"sacred, holy\" and \"accursed, infamous\". Greek δημιουργός gave Latin its \"demiurgus\", from which English got its \"demiurge\", which can refer either to God as the creator or to the devil, depending on philosophical context.\n\nIn many languages, a word stem associated with a single event may treat the action of that event as unitary, so it can refer to any of the doings or persons on either side of the transaction, that is, to the action of either the subject or the object, or to either the person who does something or the person to whom (or for whom) it is done. Other cues nail down the aspects of subject versus object. Thus there is a simple logic involved, despite that discussions of such words sometimes fixate on a superficial appearance of illogic (that is, \"how can one word mean both?!\"). Examples: \n\nContemporary English has some auto-antonym adjectives that are used for evaluating: \"sick\" can mean \"ill\" or \"extremely good\"; \"bad\" can mean \"bad\" or \"excellent\"; words like \"cool\" or \"in\" may be evaluate something that is \"warm\" or \"out\", respectively (\"This new fireplace is cool.\" or \"Outdoor activities are in, now.\"). We may hear evaluations like \"pretty ugly\", \"ridiculously serious\", \"insanely rational\", \"incredibly trustworthy\", \"impossibly doable\", \"super sub-par\".\n\nAmong profanities, adjective or article decides its meaning, for example:\n\nSeeming auto-antonyms can occur from translation. In Hawaiian, for example, \"aloha\" is translated both as “hello” and as “goodbye”, but the essential meaning of the word is \"love,\" whether used as a greeting or farewell. The Italian greeting \"ciao\" is translated as \"hello\" or \"goodbye\" depending on the context; however, the original meaning was “(I'm your) slave.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4037", "title": "Bletchley Park", "text": "Bletchley Park\n\nBletchley Park is a nineteenth-century mansion and estate near Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, constructed during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir Herbert Samuel Leon in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. It has received latter-day fame as the central site for British (and subsequently, Allied) codebreakers during World War II, although at the time of their operation this fact was a closely guarded secret. During the Second World War, the estate housed the British Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powersmost importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC&CS team of codebreakers included Alan Turing, Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry.\n\nAccording to the official historian of British Intelligence, the \"Ultra\" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain. The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the development of Colossus, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the Post Office took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment, and the Bletchley Park Trust formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations, as well as The National Museum of Computing, established on the site which includes a rebuilt Colossus machine, and receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.\n\nThe site appears in the Domesday Book as part of the Manor of Eaton. Browne Willis built a mansion there in 1711, but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down. It was first known as Bletchley Park after its purchase by Samuel Lipscomb Seckham in 1877. The estate of was bought in 1883 by Sir Herbert Samuel Leon, who expanded the then-existing farmhouse into what architect Landis Gores called a \"maudlin and monstrous pile\" combining Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles.\n\nIn 1938, the mansion and much of the site was bought by a builder planning a housing estate, but in May 1938 Admiral Sir Hugh Sinclair, head of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6), bought the mansion and of land for £6,000, using his own money after the Government said they did not have the budget to do so, for use by GC&CS and SIS in the event of war.\n\nA key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues (inspecting the site under the cover of \"Captain Ridley's shooting party\") was Bletchley's geographical centrality. It was almost immediately adjacent to Bletchley railway station, where the \"Varsity Line\" between Oxford and Cambridgewhose universities were expected to supply many of the code-breakersmet the main West Coast railway line connecting London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Watling Street, the main road linking London to the north-west (subsequently the A5) was close by, and high-volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby Fenny Stratford.\n\nBletchley Park was known as \"B.P.\" to those who worked there.\n\"Station X\" (X = Roman numeral ten), \"London Signals Intelligence Centre\", and \"Government Communications Headquarters\" were all cover names used during the war.\nThe formal posting of the many \"Wrens\"members of the Women's Royal Naval Serviceworking there, was to HMS Pembroke V. Royal Air Force names of Bletchley Park and its outstations included RAF Eastcote, RAF Lime Grove and RAF Church Green. The postal address that staff had to use was \"Room 47, Foreign Office\".\n\nAfter the war, the Government Code & Cypher School became the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) moving to Eastcote in 1946 and to Cheltenham in the 1950s. The site was used by various government agencies, including the GPO and the Civil Aviation Authority. One large building, block F was demolished in 1987 by which time the site was being run down with tenants leaving. In 1990 the site was at risk of being sold for housing development. However, Milton Keynes Council made it into a conservation area. Bletchley Park Trust was set up in 1991 by a group of people who recognised the site's importance. The initial trustees included Roger Bristow, Ted Enever, Peter Wescombe, Dr Peter Jarvis of the Bletchley Archaeological & Historical Society, and Tony Sale who in 1994 became the first director of the Bletchley Park Museums.\n\nCommander Alastair Denniston was operational head of GC&CS from 1919 to 1942, beginning with its formation from the Admiralty's Room 40 (NID25) and the War Office's MI1b. Key GC&CS cryptanalysts who moved from London to Bletchley Park included John Tiltman, Dillwyn \"Dilly\" Knox, Josh Cooper, and Nigel de Grey. These people had a variety of backgroundslinguists and chess champions were common, and in Knox's case papyrology. The British War Office recruited top solvers of cryptic crossword puzzles, as these individuals had strong lateral thinking skills.\n\nOn the day Britain declared war on Germany, Denniston wrote to the Foreign Office about recruiting \"men of the professor type\". Personal networking drove early recruitments, particularly of men from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Trustworthy women were similarly recruited for administrative and clerical jobs. In one 1941 recruiting stratagem, \"The Daily Telegraph\" was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which promising contestants were discreetly approached about \"a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort\".\n\nDenniston recognised, however, that the enemy's use of electromechanical cipher machines meant that formally trained mathematicians would also be needed; Oxford's Peter Twinn joined GC&CS in February 1939; Cambridge's Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman began training in 1938 and reported to Bletchley the day after war was declared, along with John Jeffreys. Later-recruited cryptanalysts included the mathematicians Derek Taunt, Jack Good, Bill Tutte, and Max Newman; historian Harry Hinsley, and chess champions Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry. Joan Clarke (eventually deputy head of Hut 8) was one of the few women employed at Bletchley as a full-fledged cryptanalyst.\n\nThis eclectic staff of \"Boffins and Debs\" (scientists and debutantes, young women of high society) caused GC&CS to be whimsically dubbed the \"Golf, Cheese and Chess Society\". During a September 1941 morale-boosting visit, Winston Churchill reportedly remarked to Denniston: \"I told you to leave no stone unturned to get staff, but I had no idea you had taken me so literally.\" Six weeks later, having failed to get sufficient typing and unskilled staff to achieve the productivity that was possible, Turing, Welchman, Alexander and Milner-Barry wrote directly to Churchill. His response was \"Action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.\"\n\nAfter initial training at the Inter-Service Special Intelligence School set up by John Tiltman (initially at an RAF depot in Buckingham and later in Bedfordwhere it was known locally as \"the Spy School\") staff worked a six-day week, rotating through three shifts: 4p.m. to midnight, midnight to 8a.m. (the most disliked shift), and 8a.m. to 4p.m., each with a half-hour meal break. At the end of the third week, a worker went off at 8a.m. and came back at 4p.m., thus putting in sixteen hours on that last day. The irregular hours affected workers' health and social life, as well as the routines of the nearby homes at which most staff lodged. The work was tedious and demanded intense concentration; staff got one week's leave four times a year, but some \"girls\" collapsed and required extended rest. Recruitment took place to combat a shortage of experts in Morse code and German.\n\nIn January 1945, at the peak of codebreaking efforts, some 10,000 personnel were working at Bletchley and its outstations. About three-quarters of these were women. Many of the women came from middle-class backgrounds and held degrees in the areas of mathematics, physics and engineering; they were given entry into STEM programs due to the lack of men, who had been sent to war. They performed complex calculations and coding and hence were integral to the computing processes. For example, Eleanor Ireland worked on the Colossus computers.\n\nThe female staff in Dilwyn Knox's section were sometimes termed \"Dilly's Fillies\". \"Dilly's girls\" included Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, and Elisabeth Granger. Jane Hughes processed information leading to the last battle of the \"Bismarck\". Mavis Lever (who married mathematician and fellow code-breaker Keith Batey) made the first break into the Italian naval traffic. She and Margaret Rock solved a German code, the Abwehr break. Their work achieved official recognition only in 2009.\n\nMany of the women had backgrounds in languages, particularly French and German. Rozanne Colchester was a translator who worked at Bletchley from April 1942 until January 1945, mainly for the Italian air forces Section. Like most of the 'Bletchleyettes', she came from the higher middle class, her father, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Charles Medhurst, being an air attaché in Rome. Before joining Bletchley, Colchester was moving in high circles: “she had met Hitler and been flirted with by Mussolini at an embassy party”, writes Sarah Rainey. She joined the Park because she found it thrilling to fight for her country.\n\nCicely Mayhew was recruited straight from university, having graduated from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in 1944 with a First in French and German, after only two years. She worked in Hut 8, translating decoded German Navy signals.\n\nRuth Briggs, a German scholar, worked within the Naval Section and was known as one of the best cryptographers; she married Oliver Churchill of the SOE.\n\nProperly used, the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers should have been virtually unbreakable, but flaws in German cryptographic procedures, and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out, created vulnerabilities that made Bletchley's attacks just barely feasible. These vulnerabilities, however, could have been remedied by relatively simple improvements in enemy procedures, and such changes would certainly have been implemented had Germany had any hint of Bletchley's success. Thus the intelligence Bletchley produced was considered wartime Britain's \"Ultra secret\"higher even than the normally highest classification and security was paramount.\n\nAll staff signed the Official Secrets Act (1939) and a 1942 security warning emphasised the importance of discretion even within Bletchley itself: \"Do not talk at meals. Do not talk in the transport. Do not talk travelling. Do not talk in the billet. Do not talk by your own fireside. Be careful even in your Hut...\"\n\nNevertheless, there were security leaks. Jock Colville, the Assistant Private Secretary to Winston Churchill, recorded in his diary on 31 July 1941, that the newspaper proprietor Lord Camrose had discovered Ultra and that security leaks \"increase in number and seriousness\". Without doubt, the most serious of these was that Bletchley Park had been infiltrated by John Cairncross, the notorious Soviet mole and member of the Cambridge Spy Ring, who leaked Ultra material to Moscow.\n\nThe first personnel of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. The Naval, Military, and Air Sections were on the ground floor of the mansion, together with a telephone exchange, teleprinter room, kitchen, and dining room; the top floor was allocated to MI6. Construction of the wooden huts began in late 1939, and Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school in a Victorian Gothic redbrick building by a church, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.\n\nAfter the United States joined World War II, a number of American cryptographers were posted to Hut 3, and from May 1943 onwards there was close co-operation between British and American intelligence. (See 1943 BRUSA Agreement.) In contrast, the Soviet Union was never officially told of Bletchley Park and its activities a reflection of Churchill's distrust of the Soviets even during the US-UK-USSR alliance imposed by the Nazi threat.\n\nThe only direct enemy damage to the site was done 2021 November 1940 by three bombs probably intended for Bletchley railway station; Hut4, shifted two feet off its foundation, was winched back into place as\nwork inside continued.\n\nNon-naval Enigma messages were deciphered in Hut 6, followed by translation, indexing and cross-referencing, in Hut 3. Only then was it sent out to the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), the intelligence chiefs in the relevant ministries, and later on to high-level commanders in the field.\n\nNaval Enigma deciphering was in Hut 8, with translation in Hut 4.\nVerbatim translations were sent only to the Naval Intelligence Division (NID) of the Admiralty's Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC), supplemented by information from indexes as to the meaning of technical terms and cross-references from a knowledge store of German naval technology.\n\nHut 4 also decoded a manual system known as the dockyard cipher, which sometimes carried messages that were also sent on an Enigma network. Feeding these back to Hut8 provided excellent \"cribs\" for Known-plaintext attacks on the daily naval Enigma key.\n\nInitially, a wireless room was established at Bletchley Park.\nIt was set up in the mansion's water tower under the code name \"Station X\", a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole. The \"X\" is the Roman numeral \"ten\", this being the Secret Intelligence Service's tenth such station. Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby Whaddon Hall to avoid drawing attention to the site.\n\nSubsequently, other listening stationsthe Y-stations, such as the ones at Chicksands in Bedfordshire, Beaumanor Hall, Leicestershire (where the headquarters of the War Office \"Y\" Group was located) and Beeston Hill Y Station in Norfolkgathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley. Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle despatch riders or (later) by teleprinter.\n\nThe wartime needs required the building of additional accommodation.\n\nOften a hut's number became so strongly associated with the work performed inside that even when the work was moved to another building it was still referred to by the original \"Hut\" designation.\n\n\nIn addition to the wooden huts, there were a number of brick-built \"blocks\".\n\nMost German messages decrypted at Bletchley were produced by one or another version of the Enigma cipher machine, but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine.\n\nFive weeks before the outbreak of war, Warsaw's Cipher Bureau revealed its achievements in breaking Enigma to astonished French and British personnel. The British used the Poles' information and techniques, and the Enigma clone sent to them in August 1939, which greatly increased their (previously very limited) success in decrypting Enigma messages.\n\nThe bombe was an electromechanical device whose function was to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military networks. Its pioneering design was developed by Alan Turing (with an important contribution from Gordon Welchman) and the machine was engineered by Harold 'Doc' Keen of the British Tabulating Machine Company. Each machine was about high and wide, deep and weighed about a ton.\n\nAt its peak, GC&CS was reading approximately 4,000 messages per day. As a hedge against enemy attack most bombes were dispersed to installations at Adstock and Wavendon (both later supplanted by installations at Stanmore and Eastcote), and Gayhurst.\n\nLuftwaffe messages were the first to be read in quantity. The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken. When, in February 1942, the German navy introduced the four-rotor Enigma for communications with its Atlantic U-boats, this traffic became unreadable for a period of ten months. Britain produced modified bombes, but it was the success of the US Navy bombe that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war. Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.\n\nThe Lorenz messages were codenamed \"Tunny\" at Bletchley Park. They were only sent in quantity from mid-1942. The Tunny networks were used for high-level messages between German High Command and field commanders. With the help of German operator errors, the cryptanalysts in the Testery (named after Ralph Tester, its head) worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form. They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in Colossus, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by Tommy Flowers and his team at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill. The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944. Enhancements were developed for the Mark 2 Colossus, the first of which was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of 1 June in time for D-day. Flowers then produced one Colossus a month for the rest of the war, making a total of ten with an eleventh part-built. The machines were operated mainly by Wrens in a section named the Newmanry after its head Max Newman.\n\nBletchley's work was essential to defeating the U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic, and to the British naval victories in the Battle of Cape Matapan and the Battle of North Cape. In 1941, Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the North African desert campaign against German forces under General Erwin Rommel. General Sir Claude Auchinleck wrote that were it not for Ultra, \"Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo\". While not changing the events, \"Ultra\" decrypts featured prominently in the story of Operation SALAM, László Almásy's mission across the desert behind Allied lines in 1942. Prior to the Normandy landings on D-Day in June 1944, the Allies knew the locations of all but two of Germany's fifty-eight Western-front divisions.\n\nItalian signals had been of interest since Italy's attack on Abyssinia in 1935.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War the Italian Navy used the K model of the commercial Enigma without a plugboard; this was solved by Knox in 1937.\nWhen Italy entered the war in 1940 an improved version of the machine was used, though little traffic was sent by it and there were \"wholesale changes\" in Italian codes and cyphers.\n\nKnox was given a new section for work on Enigma variations, which he staffed with women (\"Dilly's girls\"), who included Margaret Rock, Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, Elisabeth Granger; and Mavis Lever.\nMavis Lever solved the signals revealing the Italian Navy's operational plans before the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941, leading to a British victory.\n\nAlthough most Bletchley staff did not know the results of their work, Admiral Cunningham visited Bletchley in person a few weeks later to congratulate them.\n\nOn entering World War II in June 1940, the Italians were using book codes for most of their military messages. The exception was the Italian Navy, which after the Battle of Cape Matapan started using the C-38 version of the Boris Hagelin rotor-based cipher machine, particularly to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa.\nAs a consequence, JRM Butler recruited his former student Bernard Willson to join a team with two others in Hut4. In June 1941, Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system, thus enabling military commanders to direct the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to sink enemy ships carrying supplies from Europe to Rommel's Afrika Korps. This led to increased shipping losses and, from reading the intercepted traffic, the team learnt that between May and September 1941 the stock of fuel for the Luftwaffe in North Africa reduced by 90 percent.\nAfter an intensive language course, in March 1944 Willson switched to Japanese language-based codes.\n\nA Middle East Intelligence Centre (MEIC) was set up in Cairo in 1939. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, delays in forwarding intercepts to Bletchley via congested radio links resulted in cryptanalysts being sent to Cairo. A Combined Bureau Middle East (CBME) was set up in November, though the Middle East authorities made \"increasingly bitter complaints\" that GC&CS was giving too little priority to work on Italian cyphers. However, the principle of concentrating high-grade cryptanalysis at Bletchley was maintained. John Chadwick started cryptanalysis work in 1942 on Italian signals at the naval base 'HMS Nile' in Alexandria. Later, he was with GC&CS; in the Heliopolis Museum, Cairo and then in the Villa Laurens, Alexandria.\n\nSoviet signals had been studied since the 1920s. In 193940, John Tiltman (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at Sarafand in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.\n\nAn outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the Far East Combined Bureau (FECB). The FECB naval staff moved in 1940 to Singapore, then Colombo, Ceylon, then Kilindini, Mombasa, Kenya. They succeeded in deciphering Japanese codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune. The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the Wireless Experimental Centre at Delhi, India.\n\nIn early 1942, a six-month crash course in Japanese, for 20 undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge, was started by the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School in Bedford, in a building across from the main Post Office. This course was repeated every six months until war's end. Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in Hut 7, under John Tiltman.\n\nBy mid-1945, well over 100 personnel were involved with this operation, which co-operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at Arlington Hall, Virginia. In 1999, Michael Smith wrote that: \"Only now are the British codebreakers (like John Tiltman, Hugh Foss, and Eric Nave) beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers\".\n\nAfter the War, the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force, so that most relatives never knew more than that a child, spouse, or parent had done some kind of secret war work. Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as \"the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled\". That said, occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censor's net and appeared in print.\n\nWith the publication of F.W. Winterbotham's \"The Ultra Secret\" (1974) public discussion of Bletchley's work finally became possible (though even today some former staff still consider themselves bound to silence) and in July 2009 the British government announced that Bletchley personnel would be recognised with a commemorative badge.\n\nAfter the war, the site passed through a succession of hands and saw a number of uses, including as a teacher-training college and local GPO headquarters. By 1991, the site was nearly empty and the buildings were at risk of demolition for redevelopment.\n\nIn February 1992, the Milton Keynes Borough Council declared most of the Park a conservation area, and the Bletchley Park Trust was formed to maintain the site as a museum. The site opened to visitors in 1993, and was formally inaugurated by HRH The Duke of Kent as Chief Patron in July 1994. In 1999 the land owners, the Property Advisors to the Civil Estate and BT, granted a lease the Trust giving the Trust control over most of the site.\n\nJune 2014 saw the completion of an £8 million restoration project, which was marked by a visit from Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. The Duchess' paternal grandmother, Valerie, and Valerie's twin sister, Mary (née Glassborow), both worked at Bletchley Park during the war. The twin sisters worked as Foreign Office Civilians in Hut 6, where they managed the interception of enemy and neutral diplomatic signals for decryption. Valerie married Catherine's grandfather, Captain Peter Middleton.\n\n\nThe Bletchley Park Learning Department offers educational group visits with active learning activities for schools and universities. Visits can be booked in advance during term time, where students can engage with the history of Bletchley Park and understand its wider relevance for computer history and national security. Their workshops cover introductions to codebreaking, cyber security and the story of Enigma and Lorenz.\n\nIn October 2005, American billionaire Sidney Frank donated £500,000 to Bletchley Park Trust to fund a new Science Centre dedicated to Alan Turing. Simon Greenish joined as Director in 2006 to lead the fund-raising effort in a post he held until 2012 when Iain Standen took over the leadership role. In July 2008, a letter to \"The Times\" from more than a hundred academics condemned the neglect of the site. In September 2008, PGP, IBM, and other technology firms announced a fund-raising campaign to repair the facility. On 6 November 2008 it was announced that English Heritage would donate £300,000 to help maintain the buildings at Bletchley Park, and that they were in discussions regarding the donation of a further £600,000.\n\nIn October 2011, the Bletchley Park Trust received a £4.6m Heritage Lottery Fund grant to be used \"to complete the restoration of the site, and to tell its story to the highest modern standards\" on the condition that £1.7m of 'match funding' is raised by the Bletchley Park Trust. Just weeks later, Google contributed £550k and by June 2012 the trust had successfully raised £2.4m to unlock the grants to restore Huts 3 and 6, as well as develop its exhibition centre in Block C.\n\nAdditional income is raised by renting Block H to the National Museum of Computing, and some office space in various parts of the park to private firms.\n\nThe National Museum of Computing is housed in Block H, which is rented from the Bletchley Park Trust. Its Colossus and Tunny galleries tell an important part of allied breaking of German codes during World War II. There is a working reconstruction of a Colossus computer that was used on the high-level Lorenz cipher, codenamed \"Tunny\" by the British.\n\nThe museum, which opened in 2007, is an independent voluntary organisation that is governed by its own board of trustees. Its aim is \"To collect and restore computer systems particularly those developed in Britain and to enable people to explore that collection for inspiration, learning and enjoyment.\" Through its many exhibits, the museum displays the story of computing through the mainframes of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of personal computing in the 1980s. It has a policy of having as many of the exhibits as possible in full working order.\n\nThe Colossus and Tunny galleries are open daily. The rest of the museum is open to the public every Thursday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons and most bank holidays, and by appointment for groups only, at other times. There are guided tours on Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons and Thursday morning. There is a modest admission charge to the museum to help cover overheads.\n\nThe museum is working with four other organisations, in a group called Qufaro, to create the new college for students between 16 and 19 years of age. It will be located in Block G which was being renovated in 2017 with funding from the Bletchley Park Science and Innovation Centre. (Bletchley Park Trust has no involvement with the college.) The National College of Cyber Security is scheduled to open in 2018.\n\nThe Radio Society of Great Britain's National Radio Centre (including a library, radio station, museum and bookshop) are in a newly constructed building close to the main Bletchley Park entrance.\n\nBletchley Park is opposite Bletchley railway station. It is close to junctions 13 and 14 of the M1. Located northwest of London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Throughout his career, Carstairs encouraged American clients to invest in European Old Master paintings. He worked closely with industrial magnate Henry Clay Frick, and was responsible for Frick's acquisition of the 'Ilchester Rembrandt' in 1906. Carstairs also worked with Joseph Widener, an American art collector and founding benefactor of National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\nCarstairs was born in Philadelphia on August 2, 1865, the 3rd son of James Carstairs and Mary White Carstairs (née Haddock).\n\nIn 1886, Carstairs began working for his father-in-law (Charles Field Haseltine) at Haseltine Gallery, at 1125 & 1127 Chestnut Street in Philadelphia. After working for Haseltine for eight years, Carstairs began working for Knoedler & Co. in New York City. In 1897, Carstairs was sent to Pittsburgh to lead the newly opened Knoedler & Co. branch at 432 Wood Street. Here, he began promoting Old Master paintings to Pittsburgh's industrial rich. From Pittsburgh, Carstairs moved to England in 1908 to lead Knoedler's London branch, which had opened in 1902 at 15 Old Bond Street. Carstairs reoriented the London gallery's focus from contemporary Parisian artists to Old Master paintings. The outbreak of World War I interrupted international trade, but also lead to the movement of many Old Master Art works to the United States. This movement of art works was advantageous, both to American dealers such as Knoedler & Co. and collectors such as Henry Clay Frick. In 1915, Carstairs stated, \"England acquired her great Masterpieces during the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars and now America's opportunity has come.\" \n\nIn 1928, upon Roland Knoedler's retirement, Charles Carstairs, his son Carroll Carstairs, Charles Henschel (Knoedler's nephew), and Carmen Mesmore took up the management of the Knoedler & Co. From this point, Charles Carstairs acted as chairman of the board at Knoedler & Co.\n\nCarstairs acted as Frick's preferred dealer for some time. The large quantity of Old Master Paintings in Frick's collection demonstrates Carstairs' influence on Frick's taste. In 1908, Frick wrote in a letter to Carstairs \"there is no-one whose judgment of the beautiful I have more confidence in than yours\". In his relocation from Pittsburgh to New York, Frick was thrown into an increasingly competitive environment of conspicuous consumption. Carstairs turned Frick's attention to increasingly expensive Old Masters paintings as well as artworks that carried social prestige, such as aristocratic portraits, and encouraged Frick to invest in such art as a means of bolstering his reputation.\n\nThe two remained close friends over Frick's lifetime. Not only did Carstairs aid in the construction of Frick's East 70th Street mansion but he also acted as an honorary pallbearer at Frick's funeral.\nIn 1886, Carstairs married Esther Holmes Haseltine (29 April 1864 - 15 January 1907). Carstairs and Haseltine had four children, Charles Haseltine Carstairs (August 1886 – 26 October 1919), Carroll Chevalier Carstairs (20 March 1888 – 2 October 1948), James Stewart Carstairs (2 June 1890 – 20 September 1932) and Elizabeth “Lily” Haseltine Carstairs (2 November 1892 – April 1977).\n\nIn 1903 Carstairs met the American actress, Elizabeth Stebbins (19 October 1875 - 7 May 1949), while crossing the Atlantic, he on a buying trip for Knoedler Gallery, and she to perform on the London stage. A romance ensued, and Carstairs divorced his wife, Esther, later that year. He married Elizabeth Stebbins in 1905 and settled in the fashionable Mayfair district of London.\n\nIn 1928, shortly after being announced chairman of the board for Knoedler & Co., Charles Carstairs died of a heart attack.\n\n\n"}

He won the Mavericks Big Wave Surf contest in 2009. In March 2017 he completed the first solo, unsupported stand-up paddle board (SUP) crossing of the Atlantic Ocean. He did it while supporting charitable organizations. He has also set other SUP world records. His efforts moved an obscure sport onto the forefront of many important media outlets.\n\nIn February 2010, Bertish competed at the 2009/10 Mavericks Surf Contest near Half Moon Bay, Northern California, winning the $50,000 big-wave surf competition. Watched by 50,000 spectators, the contestants experienced waves in excess of . Bertish arrived at the competition without his equipment and had to borrow a board to compete.\n\nIn 2016, a failed attempt at crossing the Atlantic on a stand-up paddleboard occurred. The boat was piloted by Nicholas Jarossay, a French citizen who was rescued a week into his trip.\n\nIn a 93-day trek, Bertish successfully completed a solo, unassisted and unaided crossing of the Atlantic Ocean on a stand up paddle board, going from Morocco to Antigua. The feat was the culmination of five years of preparation.\n\nOn 6 December 2016, Bertish set out from a marina in Agadir, Morocco, in a custom-built stand-up paddle craft on a journey of and 120 days across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean island of Anegada in the British Virgin Islands. His $120,000 craft was designed by Phil Morrison, a naval architect, and resembles a connected row-boat and a stand-up paddle board, called ImpiFish. It weighed , which Bertish now considers to have been \"too light.\" It had a \"number of technological amenities such as a satellite phone, a radar device, a MacBook, a water maker\" carrying the amount of fresh water he needed was impractical. On 9 March 2017, he arrived in Antigua at English Harbour becoming the first person to cross the Atlantic on a stand-up paddle board. He made the journey unsupported and unassisted in 93 days. Initially he wanted to continue to Florida, but due to forecasted poor weather made his landfall in Antigua. \n\nThe craft was self-righting if it capsized, avoiding the possibility of turtling. Gear included a life raft, flares, and an emergency grab bag. An integral part of maintaining stability in adverse weather was the use of sea anchors.\n\nBertish averaged a day, surpassing his planned daily. Paddling was mainly done at night to avoid sun exposure. \n\nThe attempt was made in order to raise money for several South African charities to feed, school and provide medical operations for children and succeeded in raising $412,000. The charities include Signature of Hope Trust, the Lunchbox Foundation and Operation Smile. The attempt had been sponsored by the financial group Carrick Wealth.\n\nIn addition to gaining the Guinness World Record for being the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a stand-up paddle board, Bermish also set another world record during the attempt by travelling the furthest distance solo, unsupported and unassisted over open ocean in a day of . In fact, he set at least three world records during the crossing; and promised to pay for a charitable surgery for each of them.\n\nPreviously he completed a 3½-day paddle and a \"source to sea\" run-paddle-bike descent of the Thames River, with an English Channel SUP bonus crossing.\n\nUnofficially and off the South African coast, he set the world record for 12-hour open ocean paddling, covering almost aided by \"great downwind conditions.\" The previous record was held by an American.\n\nBertish has been chosen, as one of 100 visionary people, to contributed a 250 word essay to be included in a 3D book.

It was published in October 1990 by Pantheon Books as a follow-up to \"\" (1981). \n\nThe guide compiles approximately 3,000 capsule album reviews, most of which were originally written by Christgau for his monthly \"Consumer Guide\" column in \"The Village Voice\" throughout the 1980s. It covers a variety of genres and musical developments from the decade, which are given an overview in his introductory essays. More insight into his grading criteria is also given in the introduction.\n\nThe book was received positively by most critics. Christgau's sensibility and the entertaining, insightful qualities of his judgements were praised, although some deemed the writing too challenging for most readers. It was succeeded in 2000 by \"Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s\", forming a three-volume series of \"Consumer Guide\" collections.\n\n\"Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s\" is the second in a series of books—beginning with 1981's \"\"—to compile, revise, and expand on Christgau's capsule album reviews, which were originally written for his monthly \"Consumer Guide\" column in \"The Village Voice\" throughout the decade specific to each volume. In the process of reviewing 20 records per month for the column, Christgau told the \"Chicago Tribune\" in 1990 that he had developed into a \"processor\" of music, with 12 to 14 hours of his day usually spent listening to albums: \n\nThis book collects approximately 3,000 \"Consumer Guide\" reviews which range individually from 50 to 150 words—accompanied by a letter grade—and are arranged as entries, ordered alphabetically by the name of the album's recording artist, and annotated with year of release and record label. The styles of music covered throughout the collection include rock, pop, country, blues, jazz, hip hop, metal, punk rock, post-punk, and a variety of world musics, such as reggae and African genres. Among the first widely published reviewers of worldbeat music, Christgau included his critiques of music from countries such as Senegal, Nigeria, and South Africa.\n\nIn the book's introductory essay, Christgau identifies a two-pronged criteria (\"importance\" and \"quality\") for the music reviewed in the guide: \"Importance divided into cultural impact (commercial or occasionally just sociopolitical reach, with added panache preferred), subcultural acclaim (especially from rock criticism's producers and consumers, but also from alternative radio and dance DJs), and past performance (increasingly problematic as more and more artists truck on into middle age). Quality boiled down to my grading system.\" Like the previous volume, the guide follows a grading schema on a scale of A-plus to E-minus, although there are far less records graded C–minus or lower in this volume. B-plus records are the most commonly reviewed in the book, and are defined by Christgau as those offering satisfactory listen through at least half their songs and encourage revisiting: \"In school, B+ is a good grade—almost any student will settle for the near-excellence it implies. It's a compliment in the Consumer Guide too.\"\n\nThere are also introductory essays about musical developments and trends during the 1980s. In one essay, Christgau identifies the fusion of post-punk and post-disco sounds as one of the decade's major developments while coining the term \"dance-oriented rock\" to describe their synthesis. An appendix lists artists overlooked in the reviews and a \"core collection\" of albums before 1980, including out of print records categorized as \"Gone But Not Forgotten\".\n\n\"Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s\" was first published in October 1990 by Pantheon Books and was reprinted in 1994 by Da Capo Press. A follow-up to \"The '80s\"—\"Christgau's Consumer Guide: Albums of the '90s\"—was published in 2000, forming a three-volume series of \"Consumer Guide\" collections. The contents of all three books were made available on Christgau's website after it went online in 2001.\n\nReviewing the book in 1991, John Lawson of the \"School Library Journal\" said it \"works well not only by itself, but also as an update\" of \"The New Rolling Stone Record Guide\" (1983) and \"The New Trouser Press Record Guide\" (1989), even if it covers only one decade of music. \"Australian Academic and Research Libraries\", the journal publication of the Australian Library and Information Association, said Christgau \"gives full rein to his pithiness and proves just how readable reference books can be\". Fellow rock critic Greil Marcus remarked on the guide in 1990: \"The entries covering a decade's work by a performer sometimes read like tiny novels, full of suspense, dramatic turnarounds, tragedy or farce. But what makes the book work is Christgau's endless capacity for surprise.\"\n\nIn the \"Los Angeles Times\", Robert Hilburn believed the collection of capsule reviews reinforced a number of qualities about Christgau: how his interest extends beyond individual recording artists and into \"the state of rock and in the richness of its culture\"; how he \"constantly challenges artists, fans and other critics to demand more of themselves and their favorites\"; and \"why he nurtures new and significant developments, however uncommercial or controversial.\" Hilburn regarded him as the premier reference for popular music, and the journalistic equivalent of Bob Dylan or Neil Young: \"Quite simply, Christgau writes with the same reckless independence and ferocious eccentricity that fuels our most valuable pop artists.\" The book's \"charged eloquence\" embodied rock music in the mind of \"Chicago Tribune\" critic Greg Kot, who could not recommend it \"highly enough\", finding the entries on pop singer Debbie Gibson and hip hop group Public Enemy especially fun to read.\n\nThe book was not without criticism. Hilburn questioned Christgau's \"grouchy dismissal\" of U2's 1980 debut \"Boy\" while noting a partiality for third-world music records and an impenetrability as a writer, citing the review of the 1987 X album \"See How We Are\" as an example of the latter. Kot believed Christgau was less understanding of metal and also called some of the writing inaccessible: \"Sometimes he assumes an intimate understanding of not only the record he's discussing but also a host of peripheral concerns that most of his readers could not possibly possess.\" \"Library Journal\"s Barry Miller praised the broad-based musical coverage but deemed the writing glib and unctuous: \"Christgau's catholic tastes provide a wonderful cornucopia, but the cumulative effect of his terminally hip prose and gymnastic verbal constructions ('boho Americanism,' 'antipunk discowave,' 'postprog art-rock,' 'mucho pusho,' etc.) is vacuous.\" Miller recommended \"The New Trouser Press Record Guide\" as an alternative of superior \"depth and information\".\n\n\"Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s\" was used by the Music Library Association as a reference to prepare select rock recordings for \"A Basic Music Library: Essential Scores and Sound Recordings\" (1997), published by the American Library Association as a guide for librarians and other collectors. According to M. Thomas Inge's \"The Greenwood Guide to American Popular Culture\" (2002), \"Christgau's Record Guide: The '80s\" was a precursor to more popular music guide series—such as \"All Music Guide\", \"MusicHound\", and \"Rough Guides\"—and has since \"maintained a resourceful timelessness ... Christgau's judgments are incisive, knowledgeable, and amusing.\" \n\nIn 2006, the \"Consumer Guide\" series was ranked fifth on \"The A.V. Club\"s list of the 17 most essential popular music books, with \"The '80s\" singled out as the best of the three; an accompanying blurb said it covered a decade \"when Top 40 and college radio were equally compelling, and Christgau could apply his naturally skeptical eye to artists who either bore the scrutiny, or shrunk away to nothing.\" The website's Michaelangelo Matos, who had been greatly influenced by Christgau, said the first two volumes were books he had read most frequently as an adult. Along with Christgau's ability to \"distill a record's essence into a handful of words\", Murray highlighted his humor, quoting \"what remains the single best sentence ever written on Prince\" from the review of \"Dirty Mind\" (1980): \"Mick Jagger should fold up his penis and go home\". Both the 1970s and 1980s guides were cited by \"Nashville Scene\" journalist Noel Murray as \"seminal works for budding rock critics, who can learn from them the art of concision and the virtue of wielding strong opinions backed by a general spirit of enthusiasm.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "14124578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14124578", "title": "Cross-race effect", "text": "Cross-race effect\n\nThe cross-race effect (sometimes called cross-race bias, other-race bias or own-race bias) is the tendency to more easily recognize faces of the race that one is most familiar with (which is most often one's own race). A study was made which examined 271 real court cases. In photographic line-ups, 231 witnesses participated in cross-race versus same-race identification. In cross-race lineups, only 45% were correctly identified versus 60% for same-race identifications.\n\nIn social psychology, the cross-race effect is described as the \"ingroup advantage\". In other fields, the effect can be seen as a specific form of the \"ingroup advantage\" since it is only applied in interracial or inter-ethnic situations, whereas \"ingroup advantage\" can refer to mono-ethnic situations as well.\n\nDeeper study of the cross-race effect has also demonstrated two types of processing for the recognition of faces: featural and holistic. It has been found that holistic processing (which occurs beyond individual parts of the face) is more commonly used in same-race situations, but there is an experience effect, which means that as a person gains more experience with those of a particular race, he or she will begin to use more holistic processing. Featural processing is much more commonly used with an unfamiliar stimulus or face.\n\nThe first research on the cross-race effect was published in 1914. It stated that humans tend to perceive people of other races than themselves to all look alike. All else being equal, individuals of a given race are distinguishable from each other in proportion to their familiarity or contact with the race as a whole. Thus, to the uninitiated Caucasian, all East Asian people look alike, while to East Asian people, all Caucasian people look alike. This does not hold true when people of different races familiarize themselves with races different from their own.\n\nCross-race effect has a strong connection with the ingroup advantage phenomenon. With ingroup advantage, people evaluate and judge members of their own self-defined group as being better and fairer than members of other groups (outgroup disadvantage). Social psychologists have demonstrated in the last 30 years that even the smallest aspect of differentiation, like preference for flavor of ice cream or style of music, can trigger ingroup advantage. If the group-building factor is a person's race, then cross-race effect appears.\nThe favoritism of ingroup members also results from the decreased inborn motivation to read the face of a person of another group or culture. Hess, Senecal & Kirouac showed in 1996 that the motivation to decode the emotional facial expression instantly decreased when the experimental subject realized that the face belonged to a person of another race\n\nA meta-analysis of several studies about emotion recognition in facial expressions revealed that people could recognize and interpret the emotional facial expression of a person of their own race faster and better than of a person of another race. These findings apply to all races in the same way. Some studies show that other races, compared to one's own race, have differently shaped faces and different details within a facial expression, making it difficult for members of other races to decode emotional expressions. However, studies have shown that the mood of the observer does not affect the cross-race effect.\n\nResearch has shown that people tend to think more categorically about outgroup members and more individually about ingroup members. For example, outgroup members may associate specific facial features with a particular race or ethnicity, and do not notice the subtle variations in skin tone, eye color, or hair texture that ingroup members recognize. Categorical thinking happens more consistently for outgroup participants while individuation does the exact opposite. These different views between outgroup and ingroup members have been known to bias conceptual cognitive processes and show that the cross-race effect actually has less to do with race than with different levels of cognitive processing that occur for ingroup and outgroup members.\n\nAnother set of cognitive theories related to cross-race effect focuses on how social categorization and individuation biases face memory. Some researchers believe that the inability for ingroup members' to recognize differences in the features of outgroup members can be explained through cognitive disregard. They find that the likelihood of falsely identifying a member of an out-group stems from an automatic encoding of a face without processing its unique features. Thus, when presented with an out-group member who has a similar face to the one that was encoded, the in-group member automatically, but incorrectly determines that the face has been \"seen\" before. These studies conclude that diminishing the cross race effect requires individuals to process ethnically-differing faces with the goal of encoding with individuation.\n\nDepth of processing also influences the presence of the cross race effect. Same-race faces are more correctly and easily discerned because deep processing, than other-race faces are. This hypothesis, however, is controversial because of its inability to be replicated within studies.\n\nThere are two challenges to the social cognition models (a) mixed evidence dealing with race accessibility, face perception, and memory and (b) the effects of development and training on the cross-race effect. Regarding the mixed evidence, the popular belief is that the more someone is exposed to people of different races the less likely they will be affected by the cross-race effect. There have been studies that support this theory, but other research has shown mixed results. For example, the results of studies done where the accessibility, as in how easy or not it is for a person to be around people of difference races, to different races is manipulated, showed that this does not always affect face memory. Second regarding the development and training effects, just because someone shows improvement with dealing with the cross-race effect due to exposure to cross race training or experience, it is not a direct prediction of a good social cognitive model. For the social cognitive model to start explaining such effects there would have to be evidence that ingroup and outgroup distinctions occur developmentally at the exact time the cross-race effect emerges in a child. There is some evidence showing when the cross-race effect first emerges, but there is little research directly testing the onset of ingroup and outgroup recognition biases in young children.\n\nThe perceptual expertise theory also suggest that if we identify the perceptual learning mechanisms that control perceptual expertise with face and non-face stimuli we will understand the cross-race effect. There are many models that deal with perceptual expertise, but all of these models share the idea that a human's face processing ability does not generalize equally to all faces. Hence, these theories propose that racial segregation results in people developing better expertise in distinguishing between faces of our own race or of a different race. Research around these theories also suggests that the more a child is exposed to cross-race face processing the lower the cross-race effect. However, if the child is not exposed to a lot of cross-race face processing the cross-race effect can increase. Furthermore, there is evidence that long term and short term exposure to cross-race face processing can improve recognition.\n\nChallenges to the perceptual expertise models are the mixed evidence for the interracial contact hypothesis, and the varied results of the training effect. The mixed evidence shows that although there is some support to the theory that the more interracial contact a person has the better a person is at cross-race recognition, all the evidence gathered does not come to the same conclusion. This mixture of results causes the relationship between cross-race exposure and recognition ability to weaken. However, there may also be a third factor that contributes to these inconsistent findings. There is some evidence that the quality of cross-race contact has an effect on this relationship. For example, research supports the position that to be able to recognize cross-race faces one has to be attentive and effortful when encoding the face into memory. Training individuals has been shown to reduce the cross race effect in people, however this quick onset is coupled with a quick off set of the ability. Although, this short term training can translate into long term training, it is not the same as actually having real life experience with the cross-race effect. Finally, there are also other processes besides perceptual expertise that can influence cross-race recognition.\n\nAnother reason the cross-race-effect may occur is that perceptions are often affected by motivations, expectations, and social cognition. Overall, the creation of norms has shaped and biased even simple perceptions such as line lengths. In terms of perception of faces, studies have shown that racially ambiguous faces that have been identified as one race or another based on their hairstyle are identified as having more features of the racial category represented by the hairstyle. Similarly, faces of an ambiguous but equal shade are interpreted as darker or lighter when accompanied by the label of either \"black\" or \"white\", respectively.\n\nIndividuals develop and store a face prototype each time they encounter a face unique to ones he or she has previously encountered (usually ones that differ in features compared to his or her ethnic group). From their studies, researchers have concluded that when an individual belonging to an ethnicity that differs from his or her own, he or she forms a prototype and reserves it for future use, if and when necessary. The prototype view raises concern, however, because individuals storing these unique faces may ignore the fact that everyone has features that may be only special to his or her makeup, and may not apply to everyone belonging to that particular ethnic group or race; thus, this results in more false alarms during eyewitness testimony or identifying perpetrators in lineups.\n\nIn his 1996 study, researchers noticed that when looking at ethnicity, in-group faces are processed without acknowledgement of ethnic-specific details and features. People code faces that deviate from the norm of their ethnic group through the absence or presence of distinctive ethnic features.\n\nThis is supported by the finding that the classification of other-race faces tends to be faster than same-race faces. This suggests that race seems to be a more perceptually salient feature than other more discerning facial features when the face belongs to a different race. Some eye tracking studies found tentative evidence for such a hypothesis by demonstrating that people look at different facial features in same- versus other-race faces. The general trend observed is that people fixate the eyes of a face with higher probability if it belongs to the same ethnic group as the observer her- or himself. However, other studies found just as pronounced differences between Asian and European \"observers′\" looking behavior and these differences were stable for both own- and other-race faces.\nThis was previously explained as stemming from a more clustered density-gradient for other-race faces than same race faces. The reasoning is that this causes more nodes to become activated in reaction to an other-race face, resulting in faster classification, but less discriminability in terms of memory. However, these exemplar-based theories cannot explain why faces that are ambiguous in terms of social category information can influence recognition.\n\nOne method researchers have suggested to help mollify the prevelence of the cross race effect is through application of the contact hypothesis. Accurate recognition and identification of other-race faces, researchers have deduced, stems from a difference in learning experiences that relate to individual ethnic groups. The cross race effect can be reduced by continual exposure ethnic groups that differ from one's own; the more positive interactions that occur between two ethnic groups, the more heterogeneous the ethnicities will seem to be. The type of contact experienced between the two ethnic groups also plays a major role in this hypothesis' effectiveness; the more intimate the contact, the higher the chances become of accurately recognizing a member of a different ethnicity than one's own\n\nAlthough most studies done about the cross race effect are with black and white participants, there are also numerous studies done with people of different ethnic backgrounds. For example, there are studies done that compare Hispanic with black and white participants, black with white and Japanese participants, Chinese with Korean and white participants, Chinese with Indian and other East Asian ethnic participants, Turkish and German participants, and finally a study has been done comparing Arab and Israeli Jews. The data from all of these studies have come to the same conclusion. The cross-race effect is evident among all people of all different races.\n\nThe cross race effect has a morphological basis: The facial appearance is morphologically different for different ethnic backgrounds. This has been established empirically, wherein a large set of 3D scans of faces from different ethnic backgrounds was automatically clustered into groups. Only facial landmark distances were used in this grouping. The result was that gender, as well as ethnicity, emerged as primary factors of group membership.\n\nWith the help of several conducted studies, researchers conclude that the accuracy of eyewitness memory is significantly affected by the ethnic identity of both the suspect and the eye-witness; an individual can more accurately recognize a face belonging to his or her race than an individual whose race differs from that of his or her own. Previous studies have analyzed how the cross-race effect affects adults during eyewitness testimony but fails to address the possible existence of age-related confounding factors: On one hand, as an individual grows older and encounters more members of the other ethnic group in question, the novelty of the ethnic difference wears off and makes it less distracting, and the individual can pay higher absolute and relative amounts of attention to subtle distinctions between members of that group; on the other hand, time also increases the individual's exposure to biases prevalent in his/her own in-group, as well as compounding the effects of any self-reinforcement bias that the individual exhibits with respect to his/her preexisting opinions. The literature available on this topic is minute and conflicting; some researchers have found a prevalence of the cross-race effect in both white and black children, yet others have reported findings of children possessing the ability to discern other-race faces accurately. In their aim to identify developmental differences, researchers such as Pezdek et al. discovered that children recognize faces belonging to their own race more effectively than faces belonging to another race.\n\nThis effect refers to the decreased ability of people of one race to recognize faces and facial expressions of people of another race. This differs from the cross-race bias because this effect is found mostly during eyewitness identification as well as identification of a suspect in a line-up. In these situations, many people feel as if races other than their own look alike, and they have difficulty distinguishing between members of different ethnic groups. Cross-race identification bias is also known as the misinformation effect since people are considered to be misinformed about other races and have difficulty identifying them. In a study dealing with eyewitness testimony, investigators examined forty participants in a racially diverse area of the US. Participants watched a video of a property crime being committed, then in the next 24 hours came to pick the suspect out of a photo line-up. Most of the participants in the study either misidentified the suspect or stated the suspect was not in the line-up at all. Correct identification of the suspect occurred more often when the eyewitness and the suspect were of the same race. In another study, 86 convenience store clerks were asked to identify three customers: one white, one black, and one Mexican, all of whom had purchased in the store earlier that day. The clerks tended to identify customers belonging to their own race accurately, but were more likely to make errors when attempting to identify other races members. Meanwhile, another study found that \"alcohol intoxication reduces the own-race bias in face recognition,\" albeit by impairing accurate perception and leaving in place or increasing random error rather than by improving facial recognition of members of other groups.\n\nThere has been some disagreement about the consistency of the own-race bias. However, data gathered from multiple studies does show that the own-race bias is consistent. The own-race bias occurs in people of all races. Since eyewitness identification can be problematic, researches have started to conduct studies of own-race biases using more forensics. This kind of research needs to pay more attention to a target's distinctive features and level of attractiveness. If a target is very distinctive or very attractive, it could reduce the cross-race effect because that person would be easier to identify.\n\nPsychological experts all agree that the cross-race effect is a common occurrence during in-court testimony when an eyewitness is trying to remember a person. In order to reduce the cross-race effect there have been multiple changes to how policemen handle eyewitness identification. For example, to reduce the cross-race identification bias Britain has a law that states police must include the suspect in a line up with at least eight other people who share similar characteristics to him or her. This forces the eyewitness to use his or her memory of the suspects features, not the suspect's race, as a form of identification.\n\nIn a globalized world, in which different cultures and races collaborate and negotiate about contracts, licenses, rights and political decisions, one clearly sees the negative impacts of the cross-race effect. Prof. Thomas (Department of Intercultural Communication, Regensburg, Germany) stated that at least 50% of Western-Chinese negotiations fail due to impaired communication. Even signed contracts lead to suboptimal results in 60–70% of the cases. \"Trends in Managing Mobility 2007\" found that 30% of the failed negotiations could be indirectly traced back to the cross-race effect. Consequences of the cross-race effect include reduced emotional intelligence, negative evaluation of trustworthiness, reduced ability to communicate, lack of empathy and a decreased ability to judge the overall situation of a negotiation.\n\nA study was done in which participants were forewarned about cross-race effect. Results from this study showed that the cross-race effect could be reduced and sometimes even eliminated when participants were wary of it.\n\nSimilar biases have been found for aspects other than race. There is an own-gender bias, although evidence suggests that this comes down to hair style recognition. Also, there is an own-age bias where people are better at recognising people of a similar age as themselves.\n\n\n"}

The second-largest art museum in the world, it was founded in 1764 when Empress Catherine the Great acquired an impressive collection of paintings from the Berlin merchant Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky. The museum celebrates the anniversary of its founding each year on 7 December, Saint Catherine's Day. It has been open to the public since 1852.\n\nIts collections, of which only a small part is on permanent display, comprise over three million items (the numismatic collection accounts for about one-third of them), including the largest collection of paintings in the world. The collections occupy a large complex of six historic buildings along Palace Embankment, including the Winter Palace, a former residence of Russian emperors. Apart from them, the Menshikov Palace, Museum of Porcelain, Storage Facility at Staraya Derevnya, and the eastern wing of the General Staff Building are also part of the museum. The museum has several exhibition centers abroad. The Hermitage is a federal state property. Since July 1992, the director of the museum has been Mikhail Piotrovsky.\n\nOf the six buildings in the main museum complex, five—namely the Winter Palace, Small Hermitage, Old Hermitage, New Hermitage, and Hermitage Theatre—are open to the public. The entrance ticket for foreign tourists costs more than the fee paid by citizens of Russia and Belarus. However, entrance is free of charge the first Thursday of every month for all visitors, and free daily for students and children. The museum is closed on Mondays. The entrance for individual visitors is located in the Winter Palace, accessible from the Courtyard.\n\nA hermitage is the dwelling of a hermit or recluse. The word derives from Old French \"hermit, ermit\" \"hermit, recluse\", from Late Latin \"eremita\", from Greek \"eremites\", literally \"people who live alone\", which is in turn derived from ἐρημός (\"erēmos\"), \"desert\". The building was initially given this name because of its exclusivity - in its early days, only very few people were allowed to visit.\n\nOriginally, the only building housing the collection was the \"Small Hermitage\". Today, the Hermitage Museum encompasses many buildings on the Palace Embankment and its neighbourhoods. Apart from the Small Hermitage, the museum now also includes the \"Old Hermitage\" (also called \"Large Hermitage\"), the \"New Hermitage\", the \"Hermitage Theatre\", and the \"Winter Palace\", the former main residence of the Russian tsars. In recent years, the Hermitage has expanded to the General Staff Building on the Palace Square facing the Winter Palace, and the Menshikov Palace.\n\nThe Western European Art collection includes European paintings, sculpture, and applied art from the 13th to the 20th centuries. It is displayed, in about 120 rooms, on the first and second floor of the four main buildings. Drawings and prints are displayed in temporary exhibitions.\n\nSince 1940, the Egyptian collection, dating back to 1852 and including the former Castiglione Collection, has occupied a large hall on the ground floor in the eastern part of the Winter Palace. It serves as a passage to the exhibition of Classical Antiquities. A modest collection of the culture of Ancient Mesopotamia, including a number of Assyrian reliefs from Babylon, Dur-Sharrukin and Nimrud, is located in the same part of the building.\n\nThe collection of classical antiquities occupies most of the ground floor of the Old and New Hermitage buildings. The interiors of the ground floor were designed by German architect Leo von Klenze in the Greek revival style in the early 1850s, using painted polished stucco and columns of natural marble and granite. One of the largest and most notable interiors of the first floor is the Hall of Twenty Columns, divided into three parts by two rows of grey monolithic columns of Serdobol granite, intended for the display of Graeco-Etruscan vases. Its floor is made of a modern marble mosaic imitating ancient tradition, while the stucco walls and ceiling are covered in painting.\n\nThe Room of the Great Vase in the western wing features the high Kolyvan Vase, weighing , made of jasper in 1843 and installed before the walls were erected. While the western wing was designed for exhibitions, the rooms on the ground floor in the eastern wing of the New Hermitage, now also hosting exhibitions, were originally intended for libraries. The floor of the Athena Room in the south-eastern corner of the building, one of the original libraries, is decorated with an authentic 4th-century mosaic excavated in an early Christian basilica in Chersonesos in 1854.\n\nThe collection of classical antiquities features Greek artifacts from the third millennium – fifth century BC, ancient Greek pottery, items from the Greek cities of the North Pontic Greek colonies, Hellenistic sculpture and jewellery, including engraved gems and cameos, such as the famous Gonzaga Cameo, Italic art from the 9th to second century BC, Roman marble and bronze sculpture and applied art from the first century BC - fourth century AD, including copies of Classical and Hellenistic Greek sculptures. One of the highlights of the collection is the Tauride Venus, which, according to latest research, is an original Hellenistic Greek sculpture rather than a Roman copy as it was thought before. There are, however, only a few pieces of authentic Classical Greek sculpture and sepulchral monuments.\n\nOn the ground floor in the western wing of the Winter Palace the collections of prehistoric artifacts and the culture and art of the Caucasus are located, as well as the second treasure gallery. The prehistoric artifacts date from the Paleolithic to the Iron Age and were excavated all over Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union and Russian Empire. Among them is a renowned collection of the art and culture of nomadic tribes of the Altai from Pazyryk and Bashadar sites, including the world's oldest surviving knotted-pile carpet and a well-preserved wooden chariot, both from the 4th–3rd centuries BC. The Caucasian exhibition includes a collection of Urartu artifacts from Armenia and Western Armenia. Many of them were excavated at Teishebaini under the supervision of Boris Piotrovsky, former director of the Hermitage Museum.\n\nFour small rooms on the ground floor, enclosed in the middle of the New Hermitage between the room displaying Classical Antiquities, comprise the first treasure gallery, featuring western jewellery from the 4th millennium BC to the early 20th century AD. The second treasure gallery, located on the ground floor in the southwest corner of the Winter Palace, features jewellery from the Pontic steppes, Caucasus and Asia, in particular Scythian and Sarmatian gold. Visitors may only visit the treasure galleries as part of a guided tour.\nPavilion Hall, designed by Andrei Stackenschneider in 1858, occupies the first floor of the Northern Pavilion in the Small Hermitage. It features the 18th-century golden Peacock Clock by James Cox and a collection of mosaics. The floor of the hall is adorned with a 19th-century imitation of an ancient Roman mosaic.\n\nTwo galleries spanning the west side of the Small Hermitage from the Northern to Southern Pavilion house an exhibition of Western European decorative and applied art from the 12th to 15th century and the fine art of the Low Countries from the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nThe rooms on the first floor of the Old Hermitage were designed by Andrei Stakenschneider in revival styles in between 1851 and 1860, although the design survives only in some of them. They feature works of Italian Renaissance artists, including Giorgione, Titian, Veronese, as well as \"Benois Madonna\" and \"Madonna Litta\" attributed to Leonardo da Vinci or his school.\nThe Italian Renaissance galleries continues in the eastern wing of the New Hermitage with paintings, sculpture, majolica and tapestry from Italy of the 15th–16th centuries, including \"Conestabile Madonna\" and \"Madonna with Beardless St. Joseph\" by Raphael. The gallery known as the Raphael Loggias, designed by Giacomo Quarenghi and painted by Cristopher Unterberger and his workshop in the 1780s as a replication of the loggia in the Apostolic Palace in Rome frescoed by Raphael, runs along the eastern facade.\n\nThe first floor of New Hermitage contains three large interior spaces in the center of the museum complex with red walls and lit from above by skylights. These are adorned with 19th-century Russian lapidary works and feature Italian and Spanish canvases of the 16th-18th centuries, including Veronese, Giambattista Pittoni, Tintoretto, Velázquez and Murillo. In the enfilade of smaller rooms alongside the skylight rooms the Italian and Spanish fine art of the 15th-17th centuries, including Michelangelo's \"Crouching Boy\" and paintings by El Greco.\n\nThe museum also houses paintings by Luis Tristán, Francisco de Zurbarán, Alonso Cano, José de Ribera and Goya.\n\nThe Knights' Hall, a large room in the eastern part of the New Hermitage originally designed in the Greek revival style for the display of coins, now hosts a collection of Western European arms and armour from the 15th-17th centuries, part of the Hermitage Arsenal collection. The Hall of Twelve Columns, in the southeast corner of the New Hermitage, is adorned with columns of grey Serdobol granite and was also designed in the Greek revival style for the display of coins, is now used for temporary exhibitions.\nThe Gallery of the History of Ancient Painting adjoins the Knights' Hall and also flanks the skylight rooms. It was designed by Leo von Klenze in the Greek revival style as a prelude to the museum and features neoclassical marble sculptures by Antonio Canova and his followers. In the middle, the gallery opens to the main staircase of the New Hermitage, which served as the entrance to the museum before the October Revolution of 1917, but is now closed. The upper gallery of the staircase is adorned with twenty grey Serdobol granite columns and feature 19th-century European sculpture and Russian lapidary works.\n\nThe rooms and galleries along the southern facade and in the western wing of the New Hermitage are now entirely devoted to Dutch Golden Age and Flemish Baroque painting of the 17th century, including the large collections of Van Dyck, Rubens and Rembrandt. They also contain several paintings by Jan Brueghel the Elder (Velvet period), Frans Snyders (for example, \"The Fish Market\"), Gerard ter Borch, Paulus Potter, Jan van Goyen, Ferdinand Bol and Gerard van Honthorst.\n\nThe first floor rooms on the southern facade of the Winter Palace are occupied by the collections of German fine art of the 16th century and French fine art of the 15th–18th centuries, including paintings by Poussin, Lorrain, Watteau.\n\nThe collections of French decorative and applied art from the 17th–18th centuries and British applied and fine art from the 16th–19th century, including Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds, are on display in nearby rooms facing the courtyard. This area also holds paintings by German artists, including Hans Wertinger, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Barthel Bruyn the Elder, Caspar David Friedrich (\"Moonrise by the Sea\"), Anton Mengs, Hans Thoma, Anselm Feuerbach, Franz Stuck (\"Two Men Fighting Over a Woman\") and Heinrich Campendonk as well as paintings by Swiss painters Angelica Kauffman, Alexandre Calame, Arnold Böcklin and Ferdinand Hodler.\n\nThe richly decorated interiors of the first floor of the Winter Palace on its eastern, northern and western sides are part of the Russian culture collection and host the exhibitions of Russian art from the 11th-19th centuries. Temporary exhibitions are usually held in the Nicholas Hall.\n\nThe only portion of the second floor open to the public is in the Winter Palace. French Neoclassical, Impressionist and post-Impressionist art, including works by Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh and Gauguin, is displayed there in the southeastern corner. It also displays paintings by Camille Pissarro (Boulevard Montmartre, Paris), Paul Cézanne (Mount Sainte-Victoire), Alfred Sisley, Henri Morel, and Degas.\n\nModern art is displayed in the General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg). It features Matisse, Derain and other fauvists, Picasso, Malevich, Petrocelli, Kandinsky, Giacomo Manzù, Giorgio Morandi and Rockwell Kent. A large room is devoted to the German Romantic art of the 19th century, including several paintings by Caspar David Friedrich. The second floor of the Western wing features collections of the Oriental art (from China, India, Mongolia, Tibet, Central Asia, Byzantium and Near East).\n\nCatherine the Great started her art collection in 1764 by purchasing paintings from Berlin merchant Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky. He assembled the collection for Frederick II of Prussia, who ultimately refused to purchase it. Thus, Gotzkowsky provided 225 or 317 paintings (conflicting accounts list both numbers), mainly Flemish and Dutch, as well as others, including 90 not precisely identified, to the Russian crown. The collection consisted of Rembrandt (13 paintings), Rubens (11 paintings), Jacob Jordaens (7 paintings), Anthony van Dyck (5 paintings), Paolo Veronese (5 paintings), Frans Hals (3 paintings, including \"Portrait of a Young Man with a Glove\"), Raphael (2 paintings), Holbein (2 paintings), Titian (1 painting), Jan Steen (\"The Idlers\"), Hendrik Goltzius, Dirck van Baburen, Hendrick van Balen and Gerrit van Honthorst. Perhaps some of the most famous and notable artworks that were a part of Catherine's original purchase from Gotzkowsky were \"Danae\", painted by Rembrandt in 1636; \"Descent from the Cross\", painted by Rembrandt in 1624; and \"Portrait of a Young Man Holding a Glove\", painted by Frans Hals in 1650. These paintings remain in the Hermitage collection today.\nIn 1764, Catherine commissioned Yury Felten to build an extension on the east of the Winter Palace which he completed in 1766. Later it became the Southern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage. In 1767–1769, French architect Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe built the Northern Pavilion on the Neva embankment. Between 1767 and 1775, the extensions were connected by galleries, where Catherine put her collections. The entire neoclassical building is now known as the Small Hermitage. During the time of Catherine, the Hermitage was not a public museum and few people were allowed to view its holdings. Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe also rebuilt rooms in the second story of the south-east corner block that was originally built for Elizabeth and later occupied by Peter III. The largest room in this particular apartment was the Audience Chamber (also called the Throne Hall) which consisted of 227 square meters.\n\nThe Hermitage buildings served as a home and workplace for nearly a thousand people, including the Imperial family. In addition to this, they also served as an extravagant showplace for all kinds of Russian relics and displays of wealth prior to the art collections. Many events were held in these buildings including masquerades for the nobility, grand receptions and ceremonies for state and government officials. The \"Hermitage complex\" was a creation of Catherine's that allowed all kinds of festivities to take place in the palace, the theatre and even the museum of the Hermitage. This helped solidify the Hermitage as not only a dwelling place for the Imperial family, but also as an important symbol and memorial to the imperial Russian state. Today, the palace and the museum are one and the same. In Catherine's day, the Winter Palace served as a central part of what was called the Palace Square. The Palace Square served as St. Petersburg’s nerve center by linking it to all the city's most important buildings. The presence of the Palace Square was extremely significant to the urban development of St. Petersburg, and while it became less of a nerve center later into the 20th century, its symbolic value was still very much preserved.\n\nCatherine acquired the best collections offered for sale by the heirs of prominent collectors. In 1769, she purchased Brühl's collection, consisting of over 600 paintings and a vast number of prints and drawings, in Saxony. Three years later, she bought Crozat's collection of paintings in France with the assistance of Denis Diderot. Next, in 1779, she acquired the collection of 198 paintings that once belonged to Robert Walpole in London followed by a collection of 119 paintings in Paris from Count Baudouin in 1781. Catherine’s favorite items to collect were believed to be engraved gems and cameos. At the inaugural exhibit of the Hermitage, opened by the Prince of Wales in November 2000, there was an entire gallery devoted to representing and displaying Catherine's favorite items. In this gallery her cameos are displayed along with cabinet made by David Roentgen, which holds her engraved gems. As the symbol of Minerva was frequently used and favored by Catherine to represent her patronage of the arts, a cameo of Catherine as Minerva is also displayed here. This particular cameo was created for her by her daughter-in-law, the Grand Duchess Maria Fyodorovna. This is only a small representation of Catherine's vast collection of many antique and contemporary engraved gems and cameos.\nThe collection soon overgrew the building. In her lifetime, Catherine acquired 4,000 paintings from the old masters, 38,000 books, 10,000 engraved gems, 10,000 drawings, 16,000 coins and medals and a natural history collection filling two galleries, so in 1771 she commissioned Yury Felten to build another major extension. The neoclassical building was completed in 1787 and has come to be known as the Large Hermitage or Old Hermitage. Catherine also gave the name of the Hermitage to her private theatre, built nearby between 1783 and 1787 by the Italian architect Giacomo Quarenghi. In London in 1787, Catherine acquired the collection of sculpture that belonged to Lyde Browne, mostly Ancient Roman marbles. Catherine used them to adorn the Catherine Palace and park in Tsarskoye Selo, but later they became the core of the Classical Antiquities collection of the Hermitage. From 1787 to 1792, Quarenghi designed and built a wing along the Winter Canal with the Raphael Loggias to replicate the loggia in the Apostolic Palace in Rome designed by Donato Bramante and frescoed by Raphael. The loggias in Saint Petersburg were adorned with copies of Vatican frescoes painted by Cristopher Unterberger and his workshop in the 1780s.\n\nCatherine succeeded in accomplishing a huge achievement in the art world. She collected thousands of impressive pieces of artwork that were numerous in size and value. In her collection, at least 4,000 paintings came to rival the older and more prestigious museums of Western Europe. Catherine took great pride in her collection, and actively participated in extensive competitive art gathering and collecting that was prevalent in European royal court culture. Through Catherine’s art collection, she gained European acknowledgment and acceptance, and portrayed Russia as an enlightened society, another feat that Catherine took great pride in. Catherine went on to invest much of her identity in being a patron for the arts. She was particularly fond of the popular deity, Minerva, whose characteristics according to classical tradition are symbolic of military prowess, wisdom, and patronage of the arts. Using the title, Catherine the Minerva, she personally created new institutions of literature and culture and also participated in many projects of her own, mostly having to do with play writing. The representation of Catherine alongside Minerva would come to be a known tradition of enlightened patronage in Russia.\n\nIn 1815, Alexander I of Russia purchased 38 pictures from the heirs of Joséphine de Beauharnais, most of which had been looted by the French in Kassel during the war. The Hermitage collection of Rembrandts was then considered the largest in the world. Also among Alexander's purchases from Josephine's estate were the first four sculptures by the neoclassical Italian sculptor Antonio Canova to enter the Hermitage collection.\n\nEventually the imperial collections were enriched by Greek and Scythian artifacts excavated within the Russian Empire.\nBetween 1840 and 1843, Vasily Stasov redesigned the interiors of the Southern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage. In 1838, Nicholas I commissioned the neoclassical German architect Leo von Klenze to design a building for the public museum. Space for the museum was made next to the Small Hermitage by the demolition of the Shepelev Palace and royal stables. The construction was overseen by the Russian architects Vasily Stasov and Nikolai Yefimov in 1842–1851 and incorporated Quarenghi's wing with the Raphael Loggias.\n\nIn 1851, in Venice the museum acquired the collection of Cristoforo Barbarigo, including five more canvases by Titian. Today, all of the paintings but one (\"Danaë\") by Titian in the Hermitage Museum came to St. Petersburg from the Barbarigo collection.\n\nThe New Hermitage was opened to the public on 5 February 1852. In the same year the Egyptian Collection of the Hermitage Museum emerged, and was particularly enriched by items given by the Duke of Leuchtenberg, Nicholas I's son-in-law. Meanwhile, in 1851–1860, the interiors of the Old Hermitage were redesigned by Andrei Stackensneider to accommodate the State Assembly, Cabinet of Ministers and state apartments. Stakenschneider created the Pavilion Hall in the Northern Pavilion of the Small Hermitage in 1851–1858.\n\nUntil the 1920s, the museum's entrance was under the portico supported by five-metre high atlantes of grey Serdobol granite from Finland in the middle of the southern facade of the New Hermitage building.\n\nIn 1861, the Hermitage purchased from the Papal government part of the Giampietro Campana collection, which consisted mostly classical antiquities. These included over 500 vases, 200 bronzes and a number of marble statues. The Hermitage acquired \"Madonna Litta\", which was then attributed to Leonardo, in 1865, and Raphael's \"Connestabile Madonna\" in 1870. In 1884 in Paris, Alexander III of Russia acquired the collection of Alexander Basilewski, featuring European medieval and Renaissance artifacts. In 1885, the Arsenal collection of arms and armour, founded by Alexander I of Russia, was transferred from the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo to the Hermitage. In 1914, Leonardo's \"Benois Madonna\" was added to the collection.\n\nImmediately after the Revolution of 1917 the Imperial Hermitage and Winter Palace, former Imperial residence, were proclaimed state museums and eventually merged.\nThe range of the Hermitage's exhibits was further expanded when private art collections from several palaces of the Russian Tsars and numerous private mansions were nationalized and redistributed among major Soviet state museums. Particularly notable was the influx of old masters from the Catherine Palace, the Alexander Palace, the Stroganov Palace and the Yusupov Palace as well as from other palaces of Saint Petersburg and suburbs.\n\nIn 1922, an important collection of 19th-century European paintings was transferred to the Hermitage from the Academy of Arts. In turn, in 1927 about 500 important paintings were transferred to the Central Museum of old Western art in Moscow at the insistence of the Soviet authorities. In the early 1930s, 70 more paintings were sent there. After 1932, a number of less significant works of art were transferred to new museums all over the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1928, the Soviet government ordered the Hermitage to compile a list of valuable works of art for export. In 1930–1934, over two thousand works of art from the Hermitage collection were clandestinely sold at auctions abroad or directly to foreign officials and businesspeople. The sold items included Raphael's \"Alba Madonna\", Titian's \"Venus with a Mirror\", and Jan van Eyck's \"Annunciation\", among other world known masterpieces by Botticelli, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, and others. In 1931, after a series of negotiations, Andrew W. Mellon acquired 21 works of art from the Hermitage and later donated to form a nucleus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (see also Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings).\nWith the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, before the Siege of Leningrad started, two trains with a considerable part of the collections were evacuated to Sverdlovsk. Two bombs and a number of shells hit the museum buildings during the siege. The museum opened an exhibition in November 1944. In October 1945 the evacuated collections were brought back, and in November 1945 the museum reopened.\n\nIn 1948, 316 works of Impressionist, post-Impressionist, and modern art from the collection of the Museum of New Western Art in Moscow, originating mostly from the nationalized collections of Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov and disestablished before the war, were transferred to the Hermitage, including works by Matisse and Picasso. Beginning in 1967, a number of works by Matisse were donated to the museum by his muse Lydia Delectorskaya.\n\nIn 1981, the restored Menshikov Palace became a new branch of the Hermitage museum, displaying Russian culture of the early 18th century.\n\nOn 15 June 1985, a man later judged insane attacked Rembrandt's painting \"Danaë\", displayed in the museum. He threw sulfuric acid on the canvas and cut it twice with his knife. The restoration of the painting had been accomplished by Hermitage experts by 1997, and \"Danaë\" is now on display behind armoured glass.\n\nIn 1991, it became known that some paintings looted by the Red Army in Germany in 1945 were held in the Hermitage. Only in October 1994 the Hermitage officially announced that it had secretly been holding a major trove of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings from German private collections. The exhibition \"Hidden Treasures Revealed\", where 74 of the paintings were displayed for the first time, was opened on 30 March 1995, in the Nicholas Hall of the Winter Palace and lasted a year. Of the paintings, all but one originated from private rather than state German collections, including 56 paintings from the Otto Krebs collection, as well as the collection of Bernhard Koehler and paintings previously belonging to Otto Gerstenberg and his daughter Margarete Scharf, including world-famous \"Place de la Concorde\" by Degas, \"In the Garden\" by Renoir, \"White House at Night\" by Van Gogh, and some other collections. Some of the paintings are now on permanent display in several small rooms in the northeastern corner of the Winter Palace on the first floor.\n\nIn 1993, the Russian government gave eastern wing of the nearby General Staff Building across the Palace Square to the Hermitage and the new exhibition rooms in 1999. Since 2003, the Great Courtyard of the Winter Palace has been open to the public providing another entrance to the museum. Also in 2003, the Museum of Porcelain opened as a part of the Hermitage on the basis of the Imperial Porcelain Factory.\n\nIn December 2004, the museum discovered another looted work of art: \"Venus disarming Mars\" by Rubens was once in the collection of the Rheinsberg Palace in Berlin, and was apparently looted by Soviet troops from the Königsberg Castle in East Prussia in 1945. At the time, Mikhail Piotrovsky said the painting would be cleaned and displayed.\n\nThe museum announced in July 2006, that 221 minor items, including jewelry, Orthodox icons, silverware and richly enameled objects, had been stolen. The value of the stolen items was estimated to be approximately $543,000 but by the end of 2006 several of the stolen items were recovered.\n\nIn recent years, the Hermitage launched several dependencies abroad and domestically.\n\nThe dependency of the Hermitage Museum in Amsterdam is known as the Hermitage Amsterdam, and is located in the former Amstelhof building. It opened on 24 February 2004 in a small building on the Nieuwe Herengracht in Amsterdam, awaiting the closing of the retirement home which still occupied the Amstelhof building until 2007. Between 2007 and 2009, the Amstelhof was renovated and made suitable for the housing of the Amsterdam Hermitage. The Amsterdam Hermitage was opened on 19 June 2009 by President Dmitry Medvedev and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.\n\nThe Hermitage dependency in Kazan (Tatarstan, Russia), opened in 2005. It was created with support from President of the Republic of Tatarstan Mintimer Shaimiev and is a subdivision of the Kazan Kremlin State Historical and Architectural Museum-Park. The museum is situated in the Kazan Kremlin in an edifice previously occupied by the Junker School built in the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nFollowing the prior experiences in London, Las Vegas, Amsterdam and Kazan, the Hermitage foundation decided to create a further branch in Italy with the launch of a national bid. Several northern Italian cities expressed interest such as Verona, Mantua, Ferrara and Turin. In 2007, the honor was awarded to the city of Ferrara which proposed its Castle Estense as the base. Since then, the new institution called \"Ermitage Italia\" started a research and scientific collaboration with the Hermitage foundation.\n\nHermitage-Vyborg Center was opened in June 2010 in Vyborg, Leningrad Oblast.\n\nA Hermitage branch is due to open in Vladivostok by 2016, and the regional government has allocated more than Rb17.7 million ($558,000) for preliminary reconstruction work on a mansion in Vladivostok’s historic downtown district to house the satellite.\n\nThe Hermitage-Siberia is due to open in Omsk in 2016.\n\nIn recent years, there have been proposals to open a Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum in the capital city of Lithuania. Like the former Las Vegas dependency, the museum is to combine artworks from the Saint Petersburg Hermitage with works from the New York Guggenheim Museum.\n\nThe Guggenheim Hermitage Museum in Las Vegas opened on 7 October 2001 and closed on 11 May 2008. The Hermitage Rooms in London's Somerset House opened on 25 November 2000. The exhibition was closed permanently in November 2007 due to poor visitor numbers.\n\n\nThe Hermitage Volunteer Service offers all those interested a unique opportunity to involve themselves in running this world-renowned museum. The program not only aids the Hermitage with its external and internal activities but also serves as an informal link between the museum staff and the public, bringing the specific knowledge of the museum’s experts to the community. Volunteers may also develop projects reflecting their own personal goals and interests: communicate a feeling of responsibility to the youth so as to help them understand the value of tradition and the necessity of its preservation.\n\nA population of cats lives on the museum grounds and serves as an attraction.\n\n\n‘Culture,’ a Russian national television channel, has been presenting the various art collections of the Hermitage to the general public for years. There are a series of programs that have aired entitled ‘My Hermitage’ that have been particularly successful. All of these programs are organized by the Director of the Hermitage, Professor Mikhail Piotrovsky, and are quite similar to the broadcasts created by Academician Boris Piotrovsky, who is Mikhail’s father. These programs were first broadcast through the Soviet Union’s ‘First’ channel, airing at the height of the museum’s boom. During this time, this channel recorded more than three million visitors every year, mostly from the Soviet Union. Another program created by the Hermitage was called ‘The Treasures of St. Petersburg,’ and was broadcast on the St. Petersburg regional television. This program gave insight into what exhibitions were being displayed at the Hermitage.\n\n\"Treasures of St Petersburg & The Hermitage\", (2003) a three-part documentary series for Channel 5 in the UK, directed by Graham Addicott and produced by Pille Runk. An Anglo-Estonian co-production by First Freedom Productions and Allfilm. DVD Cat No BDV057\n\n'Hermitage Revealed' (2014) is a BBC documentary from Margy Kinmonth. The film tells the story of its journey from imperial palace to state museum, investigating remarkable tales of dedication, devotion, ownership and ultimate sacrifice, showing how the collection came about, how it survived tumultuous revolutionary times and what makes the Hermitage unique today.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3217260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3217260", "title": "Karl Gotch", "text": "Karl Gotch\n\nCharles Istaz (August 3, 1924 – July 28, 2007) was a Belgian professional wrestler and trainer, best known by his ring name Karl Gotch. In Japan, Gotch was known as the \"God of Wrestling\" due to his influence in shaping the Japanese professional wrestling style.\n\nIstaz was born in Antwerp, Belgium, but grew up in Hamburg, Germany. He learned Greco-Roman wrestling in his early years and from the beginning he was a very well known sportsman. He wrestled in \"The Hippodroom\", a notable sports center in Antwerp, where amateur fights like boxing matches, savate matches and wrestling matches were fought.\n\nIstaz excelled in amateur wrestling and experienced a major breakthrough in his career by competing as Charles Istaz for Belgium in the 1948 Olympics in both freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling. Gotch also trained in the Indian martial art of Pehlwani. This training led to Istaz's regime of calisthenic bodyweight exercise, which were used by Indian wrestlers and other athletes to build leg endurance and strength. He also adopted other Indian exercises, such as the bridge, Hindu squats, and Hindu press ups in his wrestling. Gotch's philosophy was later passed on to several of his students.\n\nIstaz's professional wrestling career began after training in the \"Snake Pit\", run by the renowned catch wrestler Billy Riley. He debuted in the 1950s, wrestling throughout Europe under the ring name Karl Krauser, and winning various titles including the German Heavyweight Championship and the European Championship.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Istaz moved to the United States, and began wrestling as Karl Gotch. In the United States, Gotch's wrestling style and lack of showmanship held him back, and he did not experience any great popularity at the time. In 1961, he won the American Wrestling Alliance (Ohio) World Heavyweight Championship. Gotch held the belt for two years before dropping the title to Lou Thesz, one of the few American wrestlers he respected because of the similarities of their styles (the two also share a common German/Hungarian heritage). In 1962, Gotch was involved in a backstage altercation with the then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers, in which Rogers was injured. The incident alienated Gotch from American promoters, and he began looking for work in Japan.\n\nHe returned to the United States for a stint in the 1970s, with a brief run in the World Wide Wrestling Federation from August 1971 to February 1972. On December 6, 1971, he teamed with Rene Goulet to win the WWWF World Tag Team Championship from the inaugural champions, Luke Graham and Tarzan Tyler, in two straight falls of a best-two-out-of-three-falls match in Madison Square Garden. They lost the championship on February 1, 1972, to Baron Mikel Scicluna and King Curtis.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Gotch began wrestling in other countries. He wrestled in Australia as Karl Krauser, and in 1965 he defeated Spiros Arion to win the International Wrestling Alliance's Heavyweight Championship. He had also begun working in Japan, where he became very popular due to his amateur wrestling style. He wrestled in the main event of the very first show held by New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) on March 6, 1972, defeating Antonio Inoki.

The success of UWF and similar promotions influenced Japanese wrestling in subsequent decades, and changed the style of matches in NJPW and All Japan Pro Wrestling.\n\nThe German suplex is named after Gotch. Gotch was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class in 1996. In 2007, he was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n\nIstaz died on July 28, 2007 in Tampa, Florida at the age of 82.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "298509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298509", "title": "La Brea Tar Pits", "text": "La Brea Tar Pits\n\nThe La Brea Tar Pits are a group of tar pits around which Hancock Park was formed in urban Los Angeles. Natural asphalt (also called asphaltum, bitumen, pitch or tar—\"brea\" in Spanish) has seeped up from the ground in this area for tens of thousands of years. The tar is often covered with dust, leaves, or water. Over many centuries, the tar preserved the bones of trapped animals. The George C. Page Museum is dedicated to researching the tar pits and displaying specimens from the animals that died there. The La Brea Tar Pits are a registered National Natural Landmark.\n\nTar pits are composed of heavy oil fractions called gilsonite, which seeped from the Earth as oil. In Hancock Park, crude oil seeps up along the 6th Street Fault from the Salt Lake Oil Field, which underlies much of the Fairfax District north of the park. The oil reaches the surface and forms pools at several locations in the park, becoming asphalt as the lighter fractions of the petroleum biodegrade or evaporate.\n\nThe tar pits visible today are actually from human excavation. The lake pit was originally an asphalt mine. The other pits visible today were produced between 1913 and 1915, when over 100 pits were excavated in search of large mammal bones. Various combinations of asphaltum, dust, leaves and water have since filled in these holes. Normally, the asphalt appears in vents, hardening as it oozes out, to form stubby mounds. These can be seen in several areas of the park.\n\nThis seepage has been happening for tens of thousands of years. From time to time, the asphalt would form a deposit thick enough to trap animals, and the surface would be covered with layers of water, dust, or leaves. Animals would wander in, become trapped, and eventually die. Predators would enter to eat the trapped animals and also become stuck. As the bones of dead animals sink into the asphalt, it soaks into them, turning them a dark-brown or black color. Lighter fractions of petroleum evaporate from the asphalt, leaving a more solid substance, which encases the bones. Dramatic fossils of large mammals have been extricated from the tar, but the asphalt also preserves microfossils: wood and plant remnants, rodent bones, insects, mollusks, dust, seeds, leaves, and even pollen grains. Examples of some of these are on display in the George C. Page museum. Radiometric dating of preserved wood and bones has given an age of 38,000 years for the oldest known material from the La Brea seeps. The pits still ensnare organisms today, so most of the pits are fenced to protect humans and animals.\n\nThe Native American Chumash and Tongva people living in the area built boats unlike any others in North America prior to contact by settlers. Pulling fallen Northern California redwood trunks and pieces of driftwood from the Santa Barbara Channel, their ancestors learned to seal the cracks between the boards of the large wooden plank canoes by using the natural resource of tar. This innovative form of transportation allowed access up and down the coastline and to the Channel Islands. \n\nThe Portolá expedition, a group of Spanish explorers led by Gaspar de Portolá, made the first written record of the tar pits in 1769. Father Juan Crespí wrote,\nWhile crossing the basin the scouts reported having seen some geysers of tar issuing from the ground like springs; it boils up molten, and the water runs to one side and the tar to the other. The scouts reported that they had come across many of these springs and had seen large swamps of them, enough, they said, to caulk many vessels. We were not so lucky ourselves as to see these tar geysers, much though we wished it; as it was some distance out of the way we were to take, the Governor [Portolá] did not want us to go past them. We christened them \"Los Volcanes de Brea\" [the Tar Volcanoes].\n\nHarrison Rogers, who accompanied Jedediah Smith on his 1826 expedition to California, was shown a piece of the solidified asphalt while at Mission San Gabriel, and noted in his journal that \"The Citizens of the Country make great use of it to pitch the roofs of their houses\". \nThe La Brea Tar Pits and Hancock Park are situated within what was once the Mexican land grant of Rancho La Brea, now part of urban Los Angeles in the Miracle Mile district. For some years, tar-covered bones were found on the Rancho La Brea property but were not initially recognized as fossils because the ranch had lost various animals–including horses, cattle, dogs, and even camels–whose bones closely resemble several of the fossil species. The original Rancho La Brea land grant stipulated that the tar pits be open to the public for the use of the local Pueblo. Initially, they mistook the bones in the pits for the remains of pronghorn antelope (\"Antilocapra americana\") or cattle that had become mired.\n\nUnion Oil geologist W. W. Orcutt is credited, in 1901, with first recognizing that fossilized prehistoric animal bones were preserved in pools of asphalt on the Hancock Ranch. In commemoration of Orcutt's initial discovery, paleontologists named the La Brea coyote (\"Canis latrans orcutti\") in his honor.\n\nContemporary excavations of the bones started in 1913–1915. In the 1940s and 1950s, public excitement was generated by the preparation of previously recovered large mammal bones. Subsequent study demonstrated the fossil vertebrate material was well preserved, with little evidence of bacterial degradation of bone protein. They were believed to be from the last glacial period, believed to be about 30,000 years ago. After radiocarbon dating redated the last glacial period as still occurring 11 to 12,000 years ago, the fossils were redated to be 10–20,000 years old.\n\nMethane gas escapes from the tar pits, causing bubbles that make the asphalt appear to boil. Asphalt and methane appear under surrounding buildings and require special operations for removal to prevent the weakening of building foundations. In 2007, researchers from UC Riverside discovered that the bubbles were caused by hardy forms of bacteria embedded in the natural asphalt. After consuming petroleum, the bacteria release methane. Around 200 to 300 species of bacteria were newly discovered here.\n\nThe George C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries, part of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, was built next to the tar pits in Hancock Park on Wilshire Boulevard. Construction began in 1975, and the museum opened to the public in 1977.\n\nHowever, the history of the fossil museum really began in 1913 when George Allan Hancock, the owner of Rancho La Brea, granted the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County exclusive excavation rights at the Tar Pits for two years. In those two years the Museum was able to extract 750,000 specimens at 96 sites guaranteeing that a large collection of fossils would remain consolidated and available to the community. Then in 1924 Hancock donated 23 acres to LA County with the stipulation that the county provide for the preservation of the park and the exhibition of fossils found there.\n\nThe Museum tells the story of the tar pits and presents specimens excavated from them. Visitors can walk around the park and see the tar pits. On the grounds of the park are life-size models of prehistoric animals in or near the tar pits. Of more than 100 pits, only Pit 91 is still regularly excavated by researchers and can be seen at the Pit 91 viewing station. In addition to Pit 91 there is one other ongoing excavation called \"Project 23\". Paleontologists supervise and direct the work of volunteers at both sites.\n\nOn February 18, 2009, George C. Page Museum formally announced the 2006 discovery of 16 fossil deposits which had been removed from the ground during the construction of an underground parking garage for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art next to the tar pits. Among the finds are remains of a saber-toothed cat, dire wolves, bison, horses, a giant ground sloth, turtles, snails, clams, millipedes, fish, gophers, and an American lion. Also discovered is a nearly intact mammoth skeleton, nicknamed Zed; the only pieces missing are a rear leg, a vertebra and the top of its skull, which was sheared off by construction equipment in preparation to build the parking structure.\n\nThese fossils were packaged in boxes at the construction site and moved to a compound behind Pit 91, on Page Museum property so that construction could continue. Twenty-three large accumulations of tar and specimens were taken to the Page Museum. These deposits are worked on under the name \"Project 23\". As work for the public transit Metro Purple Line is extended, museum researchers know more tar pits will be uncovered, for example near the intersection of Wilshire and Curson. In an exploratory subway dig in 2014 on the Miracle Mile, prehistoric objects unearthed included geoducks, sand dollars and a 10-foot limb from a pine tree, of a type now found in central California's woodlands.\n\nAmong the prehistoric species associated with the La Brea Tar Pits are Pleistocene mammoths, dire wolves, short-faced bears, ground sloths, and the state fossil of California, the saber-toothed cat (\"Smilodon fatalis\").\n\nOnly one human has been found, a partial skeleton of the La Brea Woman dated to approximately 10,000 calendar years (c. 9,000 radiocarbon years) BP, who was 17 to 25 years old at death and found associated with remains of a domestic dog, and so was interpreted to have been ceremonially interred. John C. Merriam of the University of California led much of the early work in identifying species in the early 20th century.\n\nThe park is known for producing myriad mammal fossils dating from the last glacial period. While mammal fossils generate significant interest, other fossils, including fossilized insects and plants, and even pollen grains, are also valued. These fossils help define a picture of what is thought to have been a cooler, moister climate in the Los Angeles basin during the glacial age. Among these fossils are microfossils, which are retrieved from a matrix of asphalt and sandy clay by washing with a solvent to remove the petroleum, then picking through the remains under a high-powered lens.\nTar pits around the world are unusual in accumulating more predators than prey. The reason for this is unknown, but one theory is that a large prey animal would die or become stuck in a tar pit, attracting predators across long distances. This predator trap would catch predators along with their prey. Another theory is that dire wolves and their prey may have been trapped during a hunt. Since modern wolves hunt in packs, each prey animal could take several wolves with it. The same may also hold true of the saber-toothed cat (\"Smilodon fatalis\") known from the area.\n\nMovies filmed at the La Brea Tar Pits include \"Volcano\", \"My Girl 2\", \"Miracle Mile\", \"Last Action Hero\", and \"Seven Psychopaths\".\n\n"}

The purpose of the document is to govern the internal operations of the business in a way that suits the specific needs of the business owners. Once the document is signed by the members of the limited liability company, it acts as an official contract binding them to its terms. Many states in the United States require an LLC to have an operating agreement. LLCs operating without an operating agreement are governed by the state's default rules contained in the relevant statute and developed through state court decisions. An operating agreement is similar in function to corporate by-laws, or analogous to a partnership agreement in multi-member LLCs. In single-member LLCs, an operating agreement is a declaration of the structure that the member has chosen for the company and sometimes used to prove in court that the LLC structure is separate from that of the individual owner and thus necessary so that the owner has documentation to prove that he or she is indeed separate from the entity itself.\n\nMost states do not require operating agreements. However, an operating agreement is highly recommended for multi-member LLCs because it structures an LLC's finances and organization, and provides rules and regulations for smooth operation. The operating agreement usually includes percentage of interests, allocation of profits and losses, member's rights and responsibilities and other provisions.\nOperating agreements are legally significant. Having a correctly drafted operating agreement is crucial in case legal disputes arise between business owners.\n\n"}

She idolized Hank Williams Sr., a musician, when she was young.\n\nLater, Kostecki began working at a cocktail waitress in St. Louis, while also acting as a nanny to three children. During this time, Sam Muchnick, president of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), came into the lounge where she worked, and her boss told him that Banner was capable of doing two-hundred sit-ups. Muchnick bet her she could not complete the task, and after she did, she began getting calls to be a female professional wrestler.\n\nKostecki began her career in professional wrestling as a way to learn how to defend herself outside of the ring. She came up with the name Penny Banner because she admired Charlton Heston, who used the surname Banner in a movie, and the first name Penny was also significant to her.\n\nBanner was known for her \"dirty\" wrestling style, saying \"boos are better than no audience reaction at all\".\n\nShe held many titles in her career, including the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship three times between 1956 and 1960 and the AWA World Women's Championship in 1961. In 1959, a match with NWA World Women's Champion June Byers, which ended in a draw, although Byers had consistently beat her in matches for three years prior. She was then booked into a match with Byers in Indiana for the newly formed American Wrestling Alliance (AWA) in August 1961, but Byers no-showed. Instead of their scheduled match, the AWA booked a battle royal, which Banner won to become the first AWA World Women's Champion. She vacated the title when she moved to North Carolina with her husband and child.\n\nDuring her career, Banner had her nosed ripped up and her elbow dislocated. Banner claimed that she retired in 1977 after June Byers, who owned the NWA World Women's Championship, retired because of a car accident, and that The Fabulous Moolah had cornered much of the national women's professional wrestling scene with her trainees and herself, which left Banner with nobody to wrestle in the Carolinas. In her last twenty years of wrestling, Banner was only defeated twice: once by Moolah and once by Belle Start, both of whom used the ropes for leverage while pinning Banner.\n\nAfter retiring from the ring, Banner worked as a real-estate agent, worked in a rodeo, was the president of a local 4H, and began showing horses. In 1990, she was diagnosed with emphysema and began swimming competitively to quit her smoking. She competed in the Senior Olympics doing swimming plus the shot put and discus throws. She also served as the Commissioner of the Professional Girl Wrestling Association (PGWA) from 1992 until her death. She appeared at Slamboree 1994 with other wrestling Legends.\n\nBanner's autobiography \"Banner Days\" was completed 2005. The book took her three years to write. Also in 2005, she was featured in the documentary film \"Lipstick & Dynamite\". Her tag team partner Betty Jo Hawkins was Banner's best friend for thirty-three years until Hawkins died.\n\nBanner went on five dates with Elvis Presley between 1956 and late 1958. He also frequently saw her wrestle in Memphis. Their last date was one week before he left to join the army, and they never saw each other again. She was married to Johnny Weaver for thirty-five years before divorcing him in 1994. She became pregnant in 1959, giving birth to a daughter named Wendi.\n\nIn late 2005, Banner was diagnosed with cancer. In February 2006, the cancer had shrunk considerably after a doctor's check-up. In late 2007, Banner suffered several health crises, including pneumonia, resulting in severe weight loss. She died in her sleep at the home of her daughter, Wendi, in Charlotte, North Carolina on May 12, 2008.\n\n\n"}

Unlike eros, which was more commonly used by men, philia magic was utilized by women and others who were considered to be social inferiors.\n\nSince there was an emphasis on service to the state in Greco-Roman culture, these social inferiors felt like they were doing their country a service. If a woman was capable of repairing her broken marriage and improving her husband’s interaction with the neighbors through magic, society was benefiting as a whole. Despite this protective purpose seen by women, philia spells were looked down on by men. They were a great source of anxiety because men saw them as tools used by the social inferiors to hijack power from the male-dominated hierarchy.\n\nThrough the use of spells, women were hoping to bring out the pleasant personal qualities of their significant others and make them increasingly submissive in order to strengthen their bond. The spells consisted of many objects found in the everyday life of a woman including narcotics, amulets, rings, knotted cords, and facial ointments. Although the violent and passionate images typically depicted in eros were not found in philia, it is important to remember that like eros, the ultimate purpose of philia magic was to take control of the victim.\n\nWine was considered to be the most basic love potion by the Greeks and had to be handled with as much care as any other spell. This was because the conjurer had to gauge the effectiveness of the serving sizes. The right amount of wine would lead to sexual arousal; too much would lead to impotence. Herbal aphrodisiacs and mood enhancers such as oleander, cyclamen, and mandrake were also used in combination with wine for enhancements.\n\nThe narcotics used in potions were designed to sedate men in progressive stages beginning with cheerfulness/ sexual arousal, progressing to the weakening of vitality, and finally ending with sleep. Potions were placed in one of two categories: irritants and those used to increase relaxation and affection. As with all narcotics, there was always a risk of severe harm or death being caused by accidental overdoses. The effects of the two potion categories were difficult to distinguish in small doses, but not in large amounts. Substantial doses of irritants caused cramping, pain, and insomnia while relaxants led to drowsiness and eventually a loss of consciousness.\n\nIn the \"Cyranides\", a Greek manual focusing on magical properties, there are descriptions of different gemstones that were thought to possess certain powers.• Dendrites= lead to the love of the gods and success in the world.\n• Sapphire= will result in a victory in every lawsuit brought against you.\n• Aerizon= effective around leaders when placed within a gold ring.\n\nThere were many cases in Greek and Neo-Assyrian cultures where social inferiors would stand before their superiors armed only with a magical stone set in a ring. They were hoping that the rings would increase their goodwill and help them build favorable relationships with the hierarchy.\n\"A little ring for success and for charm (charis) and for victory… The world has nothing better than this. For when you have it with you, you will always get whatever you ask from anybody. Besides, it calms the angers (orgai) of kings and master. Wearing it, whatever you may say to anyone, you will be believed, and you will be pleasing to everybody”.\n"}
{"id": "988414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=988414", "title": "Pulsa diNura", "text": "Pulsa diNura\n\nPulsa deNura, Pulsa diNura or Pulsa Denoura ( \"The Lashes of Fire\") is a purportedly Kabbalistic ceremony in which the destroying angels are invoked to block heavenly forgiveness of the subject’s sins, causing all the curses named in the Bible to befall him resulting in his death. However, the Torah prohibits praying that something bad should happen to another person. Rather, it offers the solution to pray that the bad in the person die and he become a righteous person. The source for this modern ritual is not to be found in Kabbalah, but among the Hebrew magical manuals of antiquity, such as \"Sefer HaRazim\" (\"Book of Secrets\") and \"The Sword of Moses\".\n\nThe origin of this phrase seems to come from the Babylonian Talmud, in tractate Hagigah 15a. This page contains an Aggadic section concerning the heresies of Elisha ben Abuyah. An account is given of Elisha’s encounter with the angel Metatron and the subsequent erroneous course of action taken by Metatron. The seeming mistake of Metatron established him as being liable to receive a sentence of sixty \"pulse deNura\": , \"They took out Metatron and lashed him with sixty pulses of fire.\"\n\nA \"pulsa denura\" is also mentioned once in the \"Zohar\" (section 3:263c, \"Raya Mehemna\"), one of the classic works of Kabbalah. There it is described as a heavenly punishment against a person who does not fulfill their religious obligations. The phrase appears in a small number of other locations in the Talmud and Zohar, but not in the context of a mystical curse.\n\nSome adherents of Kabbalah developed the idea of invoking a curse against a sinner, which they termed \"pulsa deNura\".\n\nAccusations of the use of this curse by religious Jews against Jewish figures who have committed major transgressions has been made often over the past 50 years and quoted mostly in Israeli media. As the saying goes in Israel \"you have not made it in Israeli politics until you've been cursed by the Pulsa DiNura.\" Early in the 20th century, Haredi Jews in Jerusalem were accused by the media of having recited the curse against the linguist Eliezer Ben Yehuda. There have been unsubstantiated media reports of the curse being recited against archaeologists and authors. Prior to the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, there were reports that the curse had been recited against him. On February 26, 2012, Tamar Yonah of IsraelNationalNews.com interviewed Yosef Dayan, who with rabbinical guidance was involved in the Pulsa DiNura of Yitzhak Rabin and Ariel Sharon.\n\nAvigdor Eskin, a member of the Gush Emunim (bloc of the faithful) claimed to have recited the following maledictions of the Pulsa diNura on the night of October 6, 1995:\n\nRabin was assassinated within the month.\n\nIn July 2005, the Israeli media, without citing sources, reported that opponents of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza recited the Pulsa deNura in the old cemetery of Rosh Pina, asking the \"Angel of Death\" to kill Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Six months later Sharon suffered two strokes and was in a coma, fighting for his life, until his death on January 11, 2014. Of course, most analysts link this was due to his age (77) and obesity.\n\nReportedly, ten rabbis and kabalists instigated the same curse at the gravesite near Safed several months prior to the assassination of former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.\n\nOn November 7, 2006 the Edah HaChareidis said it was considering placing the curse on the organizers of the Pride parade scheduled to march in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006. Army Radio interviewed Rabbi Shmuel Papenheim, who announced, \"The Rabbinical Court has held a special session and discussed placing a 'pulsa denura' on those who have had a hand in organizing the march.\" Papenheim, editor of the Haredi religious umbrella organization’s weekly magazine, added that the rabbis were also considering placing the curse \"against the policemen who beat haredi Jews.\"\n\nIn 2013, Naftali Bennett received the pulsa denura.\n\n\n5.

There was no irregularity in this respect.\n\nWhere, however, an accused faces a charge as serious as that of rape, with a possible life sentence, he should not only be advised of his right to a legal representative, but encouraged to exercise it.\n\nOn the present facts, the accused had not been prejudiced.

He started the McLaughlin Motor Car Company in 1907, one of the first major automobile manufacturers in Canada, which evolved into General Motors of Canada.\n\nMcLaughlin was born near Bowmanville in the hamlet of Enniskillen, Ontario, the son of Robert McLaughlin and Mary Smith. As a young man, he worked for a short time in a local hardware store, then in 1887 became an apprentice in the upholstery shop of his father's company, McLaughlin Carriage Works, which had opened in 1867 and at one time was the largest manufacturer of horse-drawn buggies and sleighs in the British Empire.\n\nIn 1890, McLaughlin took a job at H. H. Babcock, an upholstery company in Watertown, New York. In 1892, McLaughlin and his brother George become junior partners in their father's company. In 1898, he married Adelaide Mowbray.\n\nWith engines from William C. Durant of Buick, he produced the McLaughlin-Buick Model F, establishing The McLaughlin Motor Car Company, incorporated on November 20, 1907. In 1908, its first full year of operation, it produced 154 cars.\n\nIn 1910, he became a director of General Motors. He sold his Chevrolet company stock in 1918, becoming president of General Motors of Canada, which continued to sell cars under the McLaughlin-Buick brand until 1942. He retired in 1945, but remained chairman of the board until his death. He remained on the board of General Motors until the early 1960s, and was coincidentally replaced by Royal Bank of Canada president Earle McLaughlin, his first cousin once removed.\n\nHis older brother, chemist John J. McLaughlin (1865–1914), founded the Canada Dry company. After his brother's death in 1914, McLaughlin became president of this company briefly until it was sold around 1923.\n\nHis mansion, Parkwood Estate, begun in 1916, was designed by the Toronto architectural firm of Darling and Pearson. In 1989, the Parkwood estate was officially designated a National Historic Site by the federal government, on the recommendation of the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board.\n\nMcLaughlin was appointed honorary lieutenant-colonel of the 34th Ontario Regiment in 1921 and held this position until 1931, at which time he was appointed honorary colonel of same unit, later designated as The Ontario Regiment (RCAC), a reserve armoured regiment based in Oshawa. Affectionately known as \"Colonel Sam\", McLaughlin served as honorary colonel until 1967, thereby becoming the longest continuously-serving colonel in the history of the Canadian Forces.\n\nIn 1967, McLaughlin was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada.\n\nIn 1951, he established the McLaughlin Foundation which, from 1953 to 2003, donated nearly $200 million to the University of Toronto and other causes, including the McLaughlin Planetarium at the Royal Ontario Museum.\n\nMcLaughlin was a major contributor to Queen's University at Kingston, Ontario. The university's Mechanical Engineering Department is housed in McLaughlin Hall, which was his donation in 1948. McLaughlin Hall in Queen's University's John Deutsch University Centre is also named for him. His wife, Adelaide McLaughlin, was honoured in 1957 by Queen's, which named the women's residence Adelaide Hall for her.\n\nIn 1947 McLaughlin and his wife donated land for a Boy Scout camp on the outskirts of Oshawa. The camp was named \"Camp Samac\".\n\nMcLaughlin donated $1 million to the 1968 library building at the University of Guelph, which bears his name.\n\nHe provided partial funding to build a college at York University in Toronto. Opened in 1968, it was named McLaughlin College in his honour.\n\nMcLaughlin Hall at St. Andrew's College in Aurora, Ontario, which he unveiled in 1971 at age 99, is named after him in recognition of his contributions to the school.\n\nHe endowed the Regimental Foundation of The Ontario Regiment (RCAC) and quietly paid the salaries of some of the regiment's soldiers during times of severely curtailed government funding.\n\nMcLaughlin House at the Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific also bears his name.\n\nIn his youth, McLaughlin competed in cycling and yachting, and he was an equestrian show jumping champion at competitions in Canada and the United States. His love of horses led to the establishment of Parkwood Stable, a thoroughbred horse racing and breeding farm located a few miles north of Oshawa, Ontario.\n\nMcLaughlin's horses won numerous races in Canada and in the U.S.; his horses won important races including the 1942 Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park. A three-time winner of Canada's most prestigious race, the Queen's Plate, in 1934 his future Hall of Fame colt Horometer won both the Queen's Plate and the Breeders' Stakes. In 1950, the nearly eighty-year-old McLaughlin retired from racing, selling his Parkwood Stable to E. P. Taylor, under whom it would become known as Windfields Farm.\n\nA long-time director of the Ontario Jockey Club, McLaughlin was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1963 and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1977.\n\n"}

{"id": "600087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600087", "title": "State Library of Victoria", "text": "State Library of Victoria\n\nState Library Victoria is the central library of the state of Victoria, Australia, located in Melbourne. It was established in 1854 as the Melbourne Public Library, making it Australia's oldest public library and one of the first free libraries in the world. The Library's vast collection includes over two million books and 350,000 photographs, manuscripts, maps and newspapers, with a special focus on material from Victoria, including the diaries of the city's founders, John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner, and the folios of Captain James Cook. It also houses some of the original armour of Ned Kelly. The Library is located in the northern centre of the central business district, on the block bounded by Swanston, La Trobe, Russell, and Little Lonsdale streets. \n\nIn 1853, the decision to build a combined library, museum and gallery was made at the instigation of Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe and Mr Justice Redmond Barry, Q.C. (Sir Redmond from 1860). A competition was held, won by the recently arrived architect Joseph Reed, whose firm and its successors went on to design most of the later extensions, as well as numerous 19th-century landmarks such as the Melbourne Town Hall, and the Royal Exhibition Building. \n\nOn 3 July 1854, the recently inaugurated Governor Sir Charles Hotham laid the foundation stone of both the new library complex and the University of Melbourne. The library was the first stage opened in 1856, with a collection of 3,800 books chosen by Mr Justice Barry, the President of Trustees. Augustus H. Tulk, the first librarian, was appointed three months after the opening. The Melbourne Public Library as it was then known was one of the first free public libraries in the world, open to anyone over 14 years of age, so long as they had clean hands. \n\nThe complex of buildings that now house the Library were built in numerous stages, housing various library spaces, art galleries and museum displays, finally filling the entire block in 1992. \n\nThe first stage was the centre of the front block, opened in 1856, with most of the front wing, along with the floor Queen's Reading Room (now Queen's Hall) complete in 1864 by Abraham Linacre. Other wings were built are various time, such as Barry Hall, along Little Lonsdale Street, in 1886, McCoy Hall (now the Redmond Barry reading boom), built for the Museum in 1892, Baldwin Spencer Hall facing Russell Street in 1909, and the McAllan Gallery on the LaTrobe Street side, built in 1932.\n\nTemporary buildings were built in 1866 for the Intercolonial Exhibition of Australasia just behind the front wing, which remained in use until 1909, when work began on the library's famed Domed Reading Room, opened in 1913, designed by Bates, Peebles and Smart, the successor to Reed's firm, now known as Bates Smart. In 1959, the dome's skylights were covered in copper sheets due to water leakage, creating the dim atmosphere that characterised the Library for decades. \n\nThe National Gallery of Victoria moved to new buildings in St Kilda Road in 1968, and the Melbourne Museum moved to the Carlton Gardens in 2000. \n\nThe library underwent major refurbishments between 1990 and 2004, designed by architects Ancher Mortlock & Woolley. The project cost approximately A$200 million. The reading room closed in 1999 to allow for renovation, when the skylights were reinstated. The renamed La Trobe Reading Room reopened in 2003.\n\nThe redevelopment included the creation of a number of exhibition spaces, some of which are used to house permanent exhibitions \"The Mirror of the World: Books and Ideas\" and \"The Changing Face of Victoria\" as well as a display from the Pictures Collection in the Cowen Gallery. As a result of the redevelopment, State Library Victoria can now be considered one of the largest exhibiting libraries in the world.\n\nIn February 2010, the southern wing of the library on Little Lonsdale Street was reopened as the Wheeler Centre, part of Melbourne's city of literature initiative.\n\nIn 2015 the Library embarked on a five-year, $88.1 million redevelopment project, Vision 2020, to transform its public spaces, programs and facilities to better meet the changing needs of the community. On 29 April 2015 the Minister for Creative Industries Martin Foley announced that the 2015–16 State Budget would provide $55.4 million towards the redevelopment of State Library Victoria, including the restoration of the Queen’s Hall, the creation of a rooftop garden terrace, a dedicated children’s and youth space, and the opening up 40 percent more of the building to the public. In late 2017, the library's contribution of $27 million from donations was eventually raised. In September 2018, the main Swanston Street entrance is temporarily closed and replaced by the newly refurbished Russell Street and La Trobe Street entrances.\n\nThe grassy lawn in front of the library's grand entrance on Swanston Street is a popular lunch-spot for the city's workers and students at the adjacent RMIT University. Originally enclosed by a picket fence, then by a wrought iron fence and gates in the 1870s, the space was opened up with the removal of the fence and the creation of diagonal paths in 1939.\n\nThe forecourt includes a number of statues. A pair of bronze lions flanked the entry from the 1860s until they were removed in 1937 due to deterioration. A memorial statue of Mr Justice Sir Redmond Barry, Q.C., by James Gilbert and built by Percival Ball was installed on the central landing of the main stairs in 1887. Flanking the entrance plaza are Saint George and the Dragon, by the English sculptor Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, installed in 1889 and Jeanne d'Arc (Joan of Arc), a replica of the statue by French sculptor Emmanuel Frémiet, installed in 1907. WW1 commemorative statues ‘Wipers’ and ‘The Driver’ were at the centre points of the 1939 diagonal paths were relocated to the ground of the Shrine of Remembrance in 1998. A statue of Charles La Trobe, by Australian sculptor Peter Corlett, was installed in 2006 in the north east corner of the lawn.\n\nOn Sundays between 2:30 pm and 5:30 pm, a speakers' forum takes place on the library forecourt, where orators take turns in speaking on various subjects, and it is popular location for protest meetings and a rallying point for marches.\n\nThe landmark Domed Reading Room was opened in 1913, and was designed by Norman G. Peebles of Bates Smart. Its octagonal space was designed to hold over a million books and up to 600 readers. It is 34.75 m in both diameter and height, and its oculus is nearly 5 m wide. The dome was the largest in the world on completion.\n\nIn 2003, it was officially renamed the LaTrobe Reading Room, and now houses the Library's Australiana collection, previously in the 1965 La Trobe Building annex.\n\nThe library has a chess room that houses a wide range of materials dedicated to the history, study and practice of chess. It contains a collection of items from the Anderson Chess Collection, one of the three largest public chess collections in the world. In addition to bookshelves containing an extensive range of books and periodicals relating to chess, the room has game tables with chessboards and pieces, and a few glass cabinets containing historical chess paraphernalia. The room is a multi-purpose room intended also for reading and studying. The Chess Room was temporarily closed in February 2017. Chess games sets and the chess collection are available in the La Trobe Reading Room until the collection moves to its permanent home in Ian Potter Queen's Hall in 2019.\nThis place is located at the eastern end of the Library. Houses contemporary collection of books, magazines, and periodicals. The centre of the room has internet enabled computers and shared desks. The mezzanine has folio-size books and more independent study desks. The ceiling has glass panels. The reading room is easily the busiest room during pre-exam period in Victoria.\n\nEntry to the room is by appointment. The room itself does not hold any collections, rather it is a place to view heritage collection materials. There are 14 historical pendant lamps hanging off the ceiling and a detailed ceramic embossed wall and ceiling. Map bags are the only collection of materials held in HCRR and consist of copies of maps of metropolitan Melbourne between the 1800s to 1900s and no appointment is required to see them.\n\nThe library maintains an extensive, world-class collection of books, periodicals, recordings and other materials pertaining to art, music and the performing arts. The room is built in a courtyard hence the angular shape of the room. The main room includes computer workstations which provide access to the Library’s catalogue, databases and the web, reading tables, laser printer, photocopier and a microfiche reader. It also has an audio visual room and listening posts.\n\nLocated in one of the courtyards, the room has extensive collection of microfilms and microfiche, printed references, databases, and biographies. There are many facilities available such as computers and a laser printer.\n\nLocated in one of the courtyards, the room holds microfilm of Victorian, interstate, and some international newspapers. There are modern microfilm and scanner readers enabling patrons to save images of newspapers to USB memory stick. Also, three months' worth of physical copies of Victorian newspapers are kept in the room.\nThere are facilities in this room to help with research.\n\nFounded by the Friends of State Library Victoria in 1968 to promote interest in the Library's Australiana collection, in 1998, the State Library Victoria Foundation became the sponsor of the journal, enabling the publication to expand considerably. it is published twice a year in Autumn and Spring.\n\nMany of the library's electronic databases are available from home to any Victorian registered as a State Library User. Databases include the full \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"; Oxford Reference dictionaries and encyclopaedias; multi-subject magazine and journal article databases; newspaper archives of most major Australian and international papers from 2000 onwards; and specialist subject databases.\n\nThe library's collection includes 2,000 rolls of film containing photographs of Melbourne and country Victoria from the early 1970s. These 70,000 photographs are in the process of being digitized and made available to the public.\n\nState Library Victoria provides education programmes for community and schools, conferences such as Reading Matters and library research fellowships. The library is home to the Centre for Youth Literature and the \"Inside a dog\" young adult fiction community. From 1994-2014 it managed the Vicnet community internet service.\n\nThe exterior of the library is prominently featured at the conclusion of the post-World War III movie \"On the Beach\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29660", "title": "State terrorism", "text": "State terrorism\n\nState terrorism refers to acts of terrorism conducted by a state against foreign targets or against its own citizens.\n\nThere is neither an academic nor an international legal consensus regarding the proper definition of the word \"terrorism\". Some scholars believe that the actions of governments can be labelled \"terrorism\". For example, using the term 'terrorism' to mean violent action used with the predominant intention of causing terror, Paul James and Jonathan Friedman distinguish between state terrorism against non-combatants and state terrorism against combatants, including 'Shock and Awe' tactics:\n\nShock and Awe\" as a subcategory of \"rapid dominance\" is the name given to massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy. It is a form of state-terrorism. The concept was however developed long before the Second Gulf War by Harlan Ullman as chair of a forum of retired military personnel.\n\nHowever, others, including governments, international organisations, private institutions and scholars, believe that the term is only applicable to the actions of violent non-state actors. Historically, the term terrorism was used to refer to actions taken by governments against their own citizens whereas now it is more often perceived as targeting of non-combatants as part of a strategy directed \"against\" governments.\n\nHistorian Henry Commager wrote that \"Even when definitions of terrorism allow for \"state terrorism\", state actions in this area tend to be seen through the prism of war or national self-defense, not terror.\" While states may accuse other states of state-sponsored terrorism when they support insurgencies, individuals who accuse their governments of terrorism are seen as radicals, because actions by legitimate governments are not generally seen as illegitimate. Academic writing tends to follow the definitions accepted by states. Most states use the term \"terrorism\" for non-state actors only.\n\nThe Encyclopædia Britannica Online defines terrorism generally as \"the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective\", and states that \"terrorism is not legally defined in all jurisdictions.\" The encyclopedia adds that \"[e]stablishment terrorism, often called state or state-sponsored terrorism, is employed by governments – or more often by factions within governments – against that government's citizens, against factions within the government, or against foreign governments or groups.\"\n\nWhile the most common modern usage of the word terrorism refers to civilian-victimising political violence by insurgents or conspirators, several scholars make a broader interpretation of the nature of terrorism that encompasses the concepts of state terrorism and state-sponsored terrorism. Michael Stohl argues, \"The use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents. Stohl clarifies, however, that \"[n]ot all acts of state violence are terrorism. It is important to understand that in terrorism the violence threatened or perpetrated, has purposes broader than simple physical harm to a victim. The audience of the act or threat of violence is more important than the immediate victim.\"\n\nScholar Gus Martin describes state terrorism as terrorism \"committed by governments and quasi-governmental agencies and personnel against perceived threats\", which can be directed against both domestic and foreign targets. Noam Chomsky defines state terrorism as \"terrorism practised by states (or governments) and their agents and allies\". Jeffrey A. Sluka has described Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman as pioneers in academic studies about state terrorism.\n\nStohl and George A. Lopez have designated three categories of state terrorism, based on the openness/secrecy with which the alleged terrorist acts are performed, and whether states directly perform the acts, support them, or acquiesce in them.\n\nAristotle wrote critically of terror employed by tyrants against their subjects. The earliest use of the word \"terrorism\" identified by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is a 1795 reference to tyrannical state behavior, the \"reign of terrorism\" in France. In that same year, Edmund Burke famously decried the \"thousands of those hell-hounds called terrorists\" who he believed threatened Europe. During the Reign of Terror, the Jacobin government and other factions of the French Revolution used the apparatus of the state to kill and intimidate political opponents, and the Oxford English Dictionary includes as one definition of terrorism \"Government by intimidation carried out by the party in power in France between 1789-1794\". The original general meaning of terrorism was of terrorism by the state, as reflected in the 1798 supplement of the Dictionnaire of the Académie française, which described terrorism as \"systeme\", \"regime de la terreur\". Myra Williamson wrote:\n\nThe meaning of 'terrorism' has undergone a transformation. During the Reign of Terror, a regime or system of terrorism was used as an instrument of governance, wielded by a recently established revolutionary \"state\" against the enemies of the people. Now the term 'terrorism' is commonly used to describe terrorist acts committed by \"non-state or sub - national entities\" against a state. (italics in original)\n\nLater examples of state terrorism include the police state measures employed by the Soviet Union beginning in the 1930s, and by Germany's Nazi regime in the 1930s and 1940s. According to Igor Primoratz, \"Both [the Nazis and Soviets] sought to impose total political control on society. Such a radical aim could only be pursued by a similarly radical method: by terrorism directed by an extremely powerful political police at an atomized and defenseless population. Its success was due largely to its arbitrary character — to the unpredictability of its choice of victims. In both countries, the regime first suppressed all opposition; when it no longer had any opposition to speak of, political police took to persecuting \"potential\" and \"objective opponents\". In the Soviet Union, it was eventually unleashed on victims chosen at random.\"\n\nMilitary actions primarily directed against non-combatant targets have also been referred to as state terrorism. For example, the bombing of Guernica has been called an act of terrorism, as well as the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Other examples of state terrorism may include the World War II bombings of London, Dresden, Chongqing, and Hiroshima.\n\nAn act of sabotage, sometimes regarded as an act of terrorism, was the peace-time sinking of the Rainbow Warrior, a ship owned by Greenpeace, which occurred while in port at Auckland, New Zealand on July 10, 1985. The bomb detonation killed Fernando Pereira, a Dutch photographer. The organisation who committed the attack, the DGSE, is a branch of France's intelligence services. The agents responsible pleaded guilty to manslaughter as part of a plea deal and were sentenced to ten years in prison, but were secretly released early to France under an agreement between the two countries' governments.\n\nAnother example is the British Military Reaction Force in Northern Ireland during the 1970s, which murdered innocent civilians from the Catholic community in order to stir up ethnic hatred and \"take the heat off the army\". In 2012–13, a former MRF member using the covername 'Simon Cursey' gave a number of interviews and published the book MRF Shadow Troop, about his time in the unit: \"We opened fire at any small group in hard areas [...] armed or not – it didn't matter. We targeted specific groups that were always up to no good. These types were sympathisers and supporters, assisting the IRA movement. As far as we were concerned they were guilty by association and party to terrorist activities, leaving themselves wide open to the ultimate punishment from us\".\n\nIn November 2013, a BBC Panorama documentary was aired about the MRF. It drew on information from seven former members, as well as a number of other sources. Soldier H said: \"We operated initially with them thinking that we were the UVF\". Soldier F added: \"We wanted to cause confusion\". In June 1972, he was succeeded as commander by Captain James 'Hamish' McGregor.\n\nIn June 2014, in the wake of the Panorama programme, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) opened an investigation into the matter. In an earlier review of the programme, the position of the PSNI was that none of the statements by soldiers in the programme could be taken as an admission of criminality.\n\nThe sinking of the Rainbow Warrior took place in New Zealand's Auckland Harbour on July 10, 1985. It was an attack carried out by French DGSE agents Captain Dominique Prieur and Commander Alain Mafart aimed at sinking the flagship craft of the Greenpeace Organisation to stop her from interfering in French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The attack resulted in the death of Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira and led to a huge uproar over the first ever attack on New Zealand sovereignty. France initially denied any involvement, and even joined in condemnation of it as a terrorist act. In July 1986, a United Nations-sponsored mediation between New Zealand and France resulted in the transfer of the two prisoners to the French Polynesian island of Hao, to serve three years there, as well as an apology and a NZD 13 million payment from France to New Zealand.\n\nIn 1987, North Korean agents detonated a bomb on Korean Air Flight 858, killing everybody aboard.\n\nRuth J Blakeley, Professor of Politics and International Relations at the University of Sheffield, accuses the United States of sponsoring and deploying state terrorism, which she defines as \"the illegal targeting of individuals that the state has a duty to protect in order to instill fear in a target audience beyond the direct victim\", on an \"enormous scale\" during the Cold War. The justification given for this was to contain Communism, but Blakeley says it was also a means by which to buttress and promote the interests of US elites and multinational corporations. The US supported death squads throughout Latin America, and US counterinsurgency training for right-wing military forces included advocacy of interrogation and torture of suspected insurgents. J. Patrice McSherry, a professor of political science at Long Island University, states that \"hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans were tortured, abducted or killed by right-wing military regimes as part of the US-led anti-communist crusade,\" which included US support for Operation Condor and the Guatemalan military during the Guatemalan Civil War. More people were repressed and killed throughout Latin America in the last three decades of the Cold War than in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, according to historian John Henry Coatsworth.\n\nDeclassified documents from the US Embassy in Jakarta in 2017 confirm that the US directly facilitated and encouraged the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists in Indonesia during the mid-1960s. Bradley Simpson, Director of the Indonesia/East Timor Documentation Project at the National Security Archive, says \"Washington did everything in its power to encourage and facilitate the army-led massacre of alleged PKI members, and U.S. officials worried only that the killing of the party's unarmed supporters might not go far enough, permitting Sukarno to return to power and frustrate the [Johnson] Administration's emerging plans for a post-Sukarno Indonesia.\" According to Simpson, the terror in Indonesia was an \"essential building block of the quasi neo-liberal policies the West would attempt to impose on Indonesia in the years to come\". Historian John Roosa, commenting on documents released from the US embassy in Jakarta in 2017, says they confirm that \"the U.S. was part and parcel of the operation, strategizing with the Indonesian army and encouraging them to go after the PKI.\" Geoffrey B. Robinson, historian at UCLA, argues that without the support of the U.S. and other powerful Western states, the Indonesian Army's program of mass killings would not have happened.\n\nDiscussions of terrorism in social sciences and philosophy tend to apply to violent non-state actors.\n\nThe chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the twelve previous international conventions on terrorism had never referred to state terrorism, which was not an international legal concept, and that when states abuse their powers they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law, rather than against international anti-terrorism statutes. In a similar vein, Kofi Annan, at the time United Nations Secretary-General, stated that it is \"time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'. The use of force by states is already regulated under international law\". Annan added, \"...regardless of the differences between governments on the question of definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is any deliberate attack on innocent civilians [or non-combatants], regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.\"\n\nDr. Bruce Hoffman has argued that failing to differentiate between state and non-state violence ignores the fact that there is a \"fundamental qualitative difference between the two types of violence.\" Hoffman argues that even in war, there are rules and accepted norms of behaviour that prohibit certain types of weapons and tactics and outlaw attacks on specific categories of targets. For instance, rules codified in the Geneva and Hague Conventions on warfare prohibit taking civilians as hostages, outlaw reprisals against either civilians or POWs, recognise neutral territory, etc. Hoffman states that \"even the most cursory review of terrorist tactics and targets over the past quarter century reveals that terrorists have violated all these rules.\" Hoffman also states that when states transgress these rules of war \"the term \"war crime\" is used to describe such acts.\"\n\nWalter Laqueur has stated that those who argue that state terrorism should be included in studies of terrorism ignore the fact that \"The very existence of a state is based on its monopoly of power. If it were different, states would not have the right, nor be in a position, to maintain that minimum of order on which all civilized life rests.\" Calling the concept a \"red herring\" he stated: \"This argument has been used by the terrorists themselves, arguing that there is no difference between their activities and those by governments and states. It has also been employed by some sympathizers, and rests on the deliberate obfuscation between all kinds of violence...\"\n\n\n\n\nPrevention of terrorism\n"}
{"id": "833947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=833947", "title": "The Cartoon History of the Universe", "text": "The Cartoon History of the Universe\n\nThe Cartoon History of the Universe is a book series about the history of the world. It is written and illustrated by American cartoonist, professor, and mathematician Larry Gonick, who started the project in 1978. Each book in the series explains a period of world history in a loosely chronological order. Though originally published as a comic book series, the series is now published in trade paperback volumes of several hundred pages each. The final volume covers history from the late 18th century to early 2008. The final two volumes, published in 2007 and 2009, are named \"The Cartoon History of the Modern World\" volumes one and two. The books have been translated into many languages, including Portuguese, Greek, Czech and Polish.\n\nSan Francisco-based underground comix publisher Rip Off Press began publishing \"The Cartoon History of the Universe\" in 1978, with the first six issues being published by 1981. Rip Off Press published 9 issues from 1978 to 1992; the first collected edition was published by Broadway Books in 1990.\n\nWhile seeking a book publisher, Gonick received early support from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who worked as an editor at Doubleday and championed \"The Cartoon History of the Universe\"'s publication.\n\n\"The Cartoon History\" is illustrated in a black-and-white cartoon style. Gonick occasionally uses crosshatching and other realistic drawing techniques, but he primarily draws with a lively brush-and-ink squiggle that resembles Bill Watterson's \"Calvin and Hobbes\", Walt Kelly's \"Pogo\", and René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's \"Astérix\". Occasionally, as in the sequences on India in the second book, he mimics Gilbert Shelton's style from \"The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers\". \n\nHis tribute to \"Asterix\" is explicit. When Gauls are depicted, not only do they often resemble Goscinny and Uderzo's characters Asterix and Obelix, but when Gonick treats the Gallic invasion of Italy (390 – 387 BCE), the characters, along with Vitalstatistix, appear unmistakably (Vitalstatistix is transported on a shield, Asterix pummels a Roman soldier, etc.); and as they trudge off into the sunset, the speech balloon reads \"Come on, Asterix! Let's get our own comic book.\"\n\nEach volume or chapter begins with a one- or two-panel introduction. An Einstein-like Professor (representing Gonick's authorial voice) prepares to travel in his time machine to whatever place or era the chapter is about. The Professor reads a passage from a historical book, which activates the \"time machine,\" a literary device. For example, the Professor reads a book about dinosaurs to introduce Volume 1 about prehistory. He reads from Hans Zinsser's \"Rats, Lice and History\" before Volume 19 about the Black Death. This introduction provides a bridge to the action, the main narrative of each chapter.\n\nAny history book has a point of view, and Larry Gonick's might best be described as \"humanist.\" However, it is not written in the style of a didactic textbook. Instead, Gonick fleshes out history into a long yarn, injecting characterization into historical personages, continually reporting gory anecdotes, and focusing on quirky details—all backed up by research—to enliven his subject. He reports both the greatness of human achievement and acknowledges humanity's savagery.\n\nIn addition to being a straight (though unusual) history, \"The Cartoon History\" helps readers understand historical cause and effect—how the past relates to the present. It explains the motivations behind human beings' discoveries, inventions, explorations, wars, triumphs, and mistakes. Gonick's editorial aim seeks to do justice to every point of view.\n\nGonick consistently uses elements of satire to find the most humor in every situation. For example, one cartoon panel depicts the barbarism of a group of Huns who had elephants herded off a cliff for their sadistic enjoyment. One Hun exclaims with an oafish grin, \"My emotions are valid!\"—juxtaposing the Hun's brutal barbarism with an anachronistic, post-modern view of his own cruelty [3].\n\nAlso noteworthy is Gonick's use of caricature. For example, he depicts the weaselly Robert Guiscard, the 11th-century Norman adventurer, as an anthropomorphic weasel, an allusion to Guiscard's name and cunning nature, and depicts Babur, the 16th-century founder of the Mughal Empire with buckteeth (an allusion to the theory that the conqueror's name means \"beaver\").\n\nConsistently enthusiastic in tone, Gonick uses each collection's bibliography to promote historical literacy. At the end of each published collection, Gonick thoroughly cites his sources. But rather than relying upon an ordinary, typeset bibliography, Gonick sustains his unorthodox style and exuberant tone as the Professor takes the reader through a cartoon tour of his sources.\n\nBecause much of \"The Cartoon History\" covers evolutionary science, physics, astronomy, and ancient history, Gonick has referenced original writings on these subjects, rather than relying on secondary sources or anthologies. Some of these primary sources are national epics, cultural writings, or holy scriptures, such as Homer's Iliad, the Rig Veda of India, and the Bible. In this way he prompts his readers also to read the primary sources.\n\nGonick's work is not the first comic history in English: an early series of comic histories was published in Victorian England: \"Comic History of England\" (1847–48) and \"Comic History of Rome\" (1852), by author Gilbert Abbott à Beckett, illustrator John Leech.\n\nBeginning with its original comic book \"Volume 1\" in 1977, the complete series covers world history through 2008.\n"}

Tsiang. The first edition of \"The Hanging on Union Square\" was self-published in 1935. The story is about a man called \"Mr. Nut\" who sits in a cafeteria, and listens to the problems of the people around him. Mr. Nut himself is unemployed, however feels as though his condition is temporary and dreams of striking it rich. Throughout the story, the reader sees Mr. Nut transforming into a radical activist. The book shows multiple facets of the social strata within the streets of Greenwich Village. The first edition was self-published in 1935, after being rejected from numerous publishers. Tsiang places numerous rejection letters in the opening pages of the novel. True to Tsiang’s radical aesthetic, the original copy does not show the title of the book, instead questioning what a book cover really is: “the cover of a book / is more of a book / than the book is a book.” The book was published in 2013 by Kaya Press, and edited by Floyd Cheung.\n\nHsi Tseng Tsiang (H.T. Tsiang) was born near Shanghai in 1899, and died decades later in 1971 in Los Angeles, CA. Tsiang is known as a poet, playwright, and novelist. In 1917, Tsiang is inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution led by Vladmir Lenin, and in 1926 attempts to migrate to the Soviet Union. After the failed migration, he enters the United States as a student, and enrolled at Stanford University. '. He was involved with the Greenwich Village literary scene in the 1920s and 1930s, and self-published a number of books which he would hawk at downtown political meetings. H.T. Tsiang is also known for writing \"And China Has Hands\" (1937), which according to American cultural historian Michael Denning was, \"repeatedly rejected by publishers (finally published in 1963). A personal history of Tsiang appears in the 2013 publication of \"The Hanging on Union Square\" in the Chronology section.\n\n\"H.T. Tsiang’s satiric, quasi-experimental novel \"The Hanging on Union Square\" explores leftist politics in Depression-era New York – an era of union busting and food lines – in an ambitious style that combines humor-laced allegory with snatches of poetry, newspaper quotations, non sequiturs, and slogans. Back in print for the first time since it was originally self-published in 1935, Kaya’s new edition of the novel follows out-of-work protagonist Mr. Nut from a workers’ cafeteria to dinner clubs and sexual exploitation in the highest echelons of society, then back again to the streets of Greenwich Village, where starving families rub shoulders with the recently evicted. In the process, Tsiang captures, hour-by-hour, Mr. Nut’s profound transformation from itinerant roustabout to radical activist. Adventurous and unclassifiable in its combination of avant-garde and proletarian concerns, The Hanging on Union Square is a major rediscovery of a uniquely American voice\". Cultural historian Alan M. Wald author of \"American Night: The Literary Left in the Era of the Cold War\" describes the book as, \"An artist of distinction, H.T. Tsiang created a genre unto itself in 1935 with \"The Hanging on Union Square\". Its republication after seventy-five years rescues - from an outlaw existence - a strangely and beautifully evocative satiric allegory\".\nKaya Press, established in 1994, is a publisher of Asian Pacific Diasporas.\n\n"}
{"id": "40281611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40281611", "title": "The Imitation Game", "text": "The Imitation Game\n\nThe Imitation Game is a 2014 American historical drama film directed by Morten Tyldum and written by Graham Moore, based on the biography \"\" by Andrew Hodges. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch as British cryptanalyst Alan Turing, who decrypted German intelligence codes for the British government during the Second World War. Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Rory Kinnear, Charles Dance, and Mark Strong also star.\n\nThe screenplay topped the annual Black List for best unproduced Hollywood scripts in 2011. The Weinstein Company acquired the film for $7 million in February 2014, the highest amount ever paid for U.S. distribution rights at the European Film Market. It was released theatrically in the United States on 28 November 2014.\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" grossed over $233 million worldwide on a $14 million production budget, making it the highest-grossing independent film of 2014. It received eight nominations at the 87th Academy Awards, winning for Best Adapted Screenplay, five nominations in the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, and three nominations at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards. It also received nine BAFTA nominations and won the People's Choice Award at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nThe film was criticised by some for its inaccurate portrayal of historical events and Turing's character and relationships. However, the LGBT civil rights advocacy organization the Human Rights Campaign honoured it for bringing Turing's legacy to a wider audience.\n\nIn 1951, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician Alan Turing after an apparent break-in at his home. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park during the Second World War.\n\nIn 1927, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from tuberculosis.\n\nWhen Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman and Charles Richards. The team are trying to decrypt the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded messages.\n\nTuring is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma. After Denniston refuses to fund construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. Joan Clarke, a Cambridge graduate, passes Turing’s test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her. With Clarke's help, Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him.\n\nTuring’s machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma settings before the Germans reset the Enigma encryption each day. Denniston orders it destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate. Turing realises they cannot act on every decoded message or the Germans will realise Enigma has been broken.\n\nTuring discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing’s sexuality. When the MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already and planted Cairncross to leak messages to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is gay. Heartbroken, Clarke states she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done.\n\nIn the 1950s, Turing is convicted of gross indecency and, in lieu of a jail sentence, undergoes chemical castration so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying that his work saved millions of lives.\n\nBefore Cumberbatch joined the project, Warner Bros. bought the screenplay for a reported seven-figure sum because of Leonardo DiCaprio's interest in playing Turing. In the end, DiCaprio did not come on board and the rights of the script reverted to the screenwriter. Black Bear Pictures subsequently committed to finance the film for $14 million. Various directors were attached during development including Ron Howard and David Yates. In December 2012, it was announced that \"Headhunters\" director Morten Tyldum would helm the project, making the film his English-language directorial debut.\nPrincipal photography began on 15 September 2013 in Britain. Filming locations included Turing's former school, Sherborne, Bletchley Park, where Turing and his colleagues worked during the war, and Central Saint Martins campus on Southampton Row in London. Other locations included towns in England such as Nettlebed (Joyce Grove in Oxfordshire) and Chesham (Buckinghamshire). Scenes were also filmed at Bicester Airfield and outside the Law Society building in Chancery Lane, and at West London Film Studios. Principal photography finished on 11 November 2013.\n\nThe bombe seen in the film is based on a replica of Turing's original machine, which is housed in the museum at Bletchley Park. However, production designer Maria Djurkovic admitted that her team made the machine more cinematic by making it larger and having more of its internal mechanisms visible.\n\nThe film's title refers to Turing's proposed test of the same name, which he discussed in his 1950 paper on artificial intelligence entitled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\".\n\nThe Weinstein Company acquired the film for $7 million in February 2014, the highest amount ever paid for US distribution rights at the European Film Market. The film is also a recipient of Tribeca Film Festival's Sloan Filmmaker Fund, which grants filmmakers funding and guidance with regard to innovative films that are concerned with science, mathematics, and technology.\n\nIn June 2014, it was announced that Alexandre Desplat would provide the original score of the film. It was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London. Desplat uses continuous piano arpeggios to represent both Turing's thinking mind and the workings of a mechanical machine. He said of the complexity of the continuity and structure of the score:\n\n[W]hen the camera at the end of the film has those beautiful shots of the young boy, the young Alan, and he's meeting with the professor who's telling him his friend Christopher is dead, and the camera is pushing in on him, I play Christopher's theme that we heard very early on in the film. There's a simple continuity there. It's the accumulation of these moments that I can slowly but surely play that make it even stronger.\n\nThe score received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score, losing to the score of \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\", also composed by Desplat.\n\nFollowing the Royal Pardon granted by the British government to Turing on 24 December 2013, the filmmakers released the first official promotional photograph of Cumberbatch in character beside Turing's bombe. In the week of the anniversary of Turing's death in June 2014, \"Entertainment Weekly\" released two new stills which marked the first look at the characters played by Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Matthew Beard, and Allen Leech. On what would have been Turing's 102nd birthday on 23 June, \"Empire\" released two photographs featuring Mark Strong and Charles Dance in character. Promotional stills were taken by photographer Jack English, who also photographed Cumberbatch for \"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\".\n\nPrinceton University Press and Vintage Books both released film tie-in editions of Andrew Hodges's biography \"Alan Turing: The Enigma\" in September 2014. The first UK and US trailers were released on 22 July 2014. The international teaser poster was released on 18 September 2014 with the tagline \"The true enigma was the man who cracked the code\".\n\nIn November 2014, the Weinstein Company co-hosted a private screening of the film with Digital Sky Technologies billionaire Yuri Milner and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Attendees of the screening at Los Altos Hills, California included Silicon Valley's top executives, such as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Linkedin's Reid Hoffman, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Airbnb's Nathan Blecharczyk, and Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. Director Tyldum, screenwriter Moore, and actress Knightley were also in attendance. In addition, Cumberbatch and Zuckerberg presented the Mathematics Prizes at the Breakthrough Awards on 10 November 2014 in honour of Turing.\n\nThe bombe re-created by the filmmakers has been on display in a special \"The Imitation Game\" exhibition at Bletchley Park since 10 November 2014. The year-long exhibit features clothes worn by the actors and props used in the film.\n\nThe official film website allowed visitors to unlock exclusive content by solving cryptic crossword puzzles supposedly conceived by Turing. The website puzzle was a shorter version of the \"Daily Telegraph\" puzzle of 13 January 1942 that was actually used in Bletchley Park recruitment during the war (and the puzzle was not set by Turing, who was no good at them). Google, which sponsored the New York Premiere of the film, launched a competition called \"The Code-Cracking Challenge\" on 23 November 2014. It is a skill contest where entrants must crack a code provided by Google. The prize/s will be awarded to entrant/s who crack the code and submit their entry the fastest.\n\nIn November 2014, ahead of the film's US release, \"The New York Times\" reprinted the 1942 puzzle from \"The Daily Telegraph\" used in recruiting codebreakers at Bletchley Park during the Second World War. Entrants who solved the puzzle could mail in their results for a chance to win a trip for two to London and a tour of Bletchley Park.\n\nTWC launched a print and online campaign on 2 January 2015 featuring testimonials from leaders in the fields of technology, military, academia, and LGBTQ groups (all influenced by Turing's life and accomplishments) to promote the film and Turing's legacy. Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and Wikipedia's Jimmy Wales all gave tribute quotes. There were also testimonials from LGBT leaders including HRC president Chad Griffin and GLAAD CEO Sarah Kate Ellis and from military leaders including the 22nd United States Defense Secretary Robert Gates.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the 41st Telluride Film Festival in August 2014, and played at the 39th Toronto International Film Festival in September. It had its European premiere as the opening film of the 58th BFI London Film Festival in October 2014. It had a limited theatrical release on 28 November 2014 in the United States, two weeks after its premiere in the United Kingdom on 14 November. The US distributor TWC stated that the film would initially debut in four cinemas in Los Angeles and New York, expanding to six new markets on 12 December before being released nationwide on Christmas Day.\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" was released on 31 March 2015 in the United States in two formats: a one-disc standard DVD and a Blu-ray with a digital copy of the film.\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" grossed $91.1 million in North America and $142.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $233.5 million, against a budget of $14 million. It was the top-grossing independent film release of 2014.\n\nThe film opened number two at the UK box office behind the big-budget film \"Interstellar\", earning $4.3 million from 459 screens. Its opening box office figure was the third highest opening weekend haul for a British film in 2014. Its opening was 107% higher than that of \"Argo\", 81% higher than \"Philomena\" and 26% higher than \"The Iron Lady\" following its debut.\n\nDebuting in four cinemas in Los Angeles and New York on 28 November, the film grossed $479,352 in its opening weekend with a $119,352 per-screen-average, the second highest per-screen-average of 2014 and the 7th highest of all time for a live-action film. Adjusted for inflation, it outperformed the Weinstein Company's own Oscar-winning films \"The King's Speech\" ($88,863 in 2010) and \"The Artist\" ($51,220 in 2011), which were also released on Thanksgiving weekend. The film expanded into additional markets on 12 December and was released nationwide on Christmas Day.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 258 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With an outstanding starring performance from Benedict Cumberbatch illuminating its fact-based story, \"The Imitation Game\" serves as an eminently well-made entry in the 'prestige biopic' genre.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The film received an average grade of \"A+\" from market-research firm CinemaScore, and a 90% \"definite recommend\" rating from its core audience, according to comScore. It was also included in both the National Board of Review and American Film Institute's \"Top 10 Films of 2014\".\n\n\"The New York Observer\"s Rex Reed declared that \"one of the most important stories of the last century is one of the greatest movies of 2014\". Kaleem Aftab of \"The Independent\" gave the film a five-star review, hailing it the \"Best British Film of the Year\". Lou Lumenick of the \"New York Post\" described it as a \"thoroughly engrossing Oscar-caliber movie\", while critic James Rocchi added that the film is \"strong, stirring, triumphant and tragic\". \"Empire\" described it as a \"superb thriller\" and \"Glamour\" declared it \"an instant classic\". Peter Debruge of \"Variety\" added that the film is \"beautifully written, elegantly mounted and poignantly performed\". Critic Scott Foundas stated that the \"movie is undeniably strong in its sense of a bright light burned out too soon, and the often undignified fate of those who dare to chafe at society's established norms\". Critic Leonard Maltin asserted that the film has \"an ideal ensemble cast with every role filled to perfection\". Praise went to Knightley's supporting performance as Clarke, Goldenberg's editing, Desplat's score, Faura's cinematography and Djurkovic's production design. The film was enthusiastically received at the Telluride Film Festival and won the \"People's Choice Award for Best Film\" at TIFF, the highest prize of the festival.\n\nCumberbatch's performance was met with widespread acclaim from critics. \"TIME\" ranked Cumberbatch's portrayal number one in its Top 10 film performances of 2014, with the magazine's chief film critic Richard Corliss calling Cumberbatch's characterisation \"the actor's oddest, fullest, most \"Cumberbatchian\" character yet ... he doesn't play Turing so much as inhabit him, bravely and sympathetically but without mediation\". Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" declared Turing \"the role of Cumberbatch's career\", while A.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" stated that it is \"one of the year's finest pieces of screen acting\". Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" asserted that the actor \"gives an explosive, emotionally complex\" portrayal. Critic Clayton Davis stated that it's a \"performance for the ages ... proving he's one of the best actors working today\". Foundas of \"Variety\" wrote that Cumberbatch's acting is \"masterful ... a marvel to watch\", Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" described it as \"delicately nuanced, prickly and tragic\" and Owen Gleiberman of the \"BBC\" proclaimed it an \"emotionally tailored perfection\". It's \"a storming performance from Cumberbatch: you'll be deciphering his work long after the credits roll\" declared Dave Calhoun of \"Time Out\". In addition, Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" concluded in her review, \"It's Cumberbatch's nuanced, haunted performance that leaves the most powerful impression\". \"The Hollywood Reporter\"s Todd McCarthy reported that the undeniable highlight of the film was Cumberbatch, \"whose charisma, tellingly modulated and naturalistic array of eccentricities, talent at indicating a mind never at rest and knack for simultaneously portraying physical oddness and attractiveness combine to create an entirely credible portrait of genius at work\". Critic Roger Friedman wrote at the end of his review, \"Cumberbatch may be the closest thing we have to a real descendant of Sir Laurence Olivier\".\n\nWhile praising the performances of Cumberbatch and Knightley, Catherine Shoard of \"The Guardian\" stated that the film is \"too formulaic, too efficient at simply whisking you through and making sure you've clocked the diversity message\". Tim Robey of \"The Telegraph\" described it as \"a film about a human calculator which feels ... a little too calculated\". Some critics also raised concerns about film's alleged reluctance to highlight Turing's homosexuality. British historian Alex von Tunzelmann, writing for \"The Guardian\" in November 2014, pointed out many historical inaccuracies in the film, saying in conclusion: \"Historically, \"The Imitation Game\" is as much of a garbled mess as a heap of unbroken code\". Journalist Christian Caryl also found numerous historical inaccuracies, describing the film as constituting \"a bizarre departure from the historical record\" that changed Turing's rich life to be \"multiplex-friendly\". L.V. Anderson of \"Slate\" magazine compared the film's account of Turing's life and work to the biography it was based on, writing, \"I discovered that \"The Imitation Game\" takes major liberties with its source material, injecting conflict where none existed, inventing entirely fictional characters, rearranging the chronology of events, and misrepresenting the very nature of Turing's work at Bletchley Park\". Andrew Grant of \"Science News\" wrote, \"... like so many other Hollywood biopics, it takes some major artistic license – which is disappointing, because Turing's actual story is so compelling.\" Computing historian Thomas Haigh, writing in the journal \"Communications of the ACM\", said that \"the film is a bad guide to reality but a useful summary of everything that the popular imagination gets wrong about Bletchley Park\", that it \"combines the traditional focus of popular science writing on the lone genius who changes the world with the modern movie superhero narrative of a freak who must overcome his own flaws before he can save the world\", and that, together with the likes of \"A Beautiful Mind\" and \"The Theory of Everything\", is part of a trend of \"glossy scientific biopic[s]\" that emphasize those famous scientists who were surrounded by tragedy rather than those who found contented lives, which in turn affects the way \"[s]ome kinds of people, and work, have become famous and others have not.\"\n\nDespite earlier reservations, Turing's niece Inagh Payne told Allan Beswick of BBC Radio Manchester that the film \"really did honour my uncle\" after she watched the film at the London Film Festival in October 2014. In the same interview, Turing's nephew Dermot Turing stated that Cumberbatch is \"perfect casting. I couldn't think of anyone better\". James Turing, a great-nephew of the code-breaker, said Cumberbatch \"knows things that I never knew before. The amount of knowledge he has about Alan is amazing\".\n\nIn January 2015, Cumberbatch, comedian-actor Stephen Fry, producer Harvey Weinstein, and Turing's great-niece Rachel Barnes launched a campaign to pardon the 49,000 gay men convicted under the same law that led to Turing's chemical castration. An open letter published in \"The Guardian\" urged the British government and the Royal family, particularly Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to aid the campaign.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign's Chad Griffin also offered his endorsement, saying: \"Over 49,000 other gay men and women were persecuted in England under the same law. Turing was pardoned by Queen Elizabeth II in 2013. The others were not. Honor this movie. Honor this man. And honor the movement to bring justice to the other 49,000.\" Aiding the cause were campaigner Peter Tatchell, \"Attitude\" magazine, and other high-profile figures in the gay community.\n\nIn February 2015, Matt Damon, Michael Douglas, Jessica Alba, Bryan Cranston, and Anna Wintour among others joined the petition at Pardon49k.org demanding pardons for victims of anti-gay laws. Historians, including Justin Bengry of Birkbeck University of London and Matt Houlbrook of the University of Birmingham, argued that such a pardon would be \"bad history\" despite its political appeal, because of the broad variety of cases in which the historical laws were applied (including cases of rape) and the distortion of history resulting from an attempt to clean up the wrongdoings of the past \"post facto\". Bengry also cites the existing ability of those convicted under repealed anti-homosexuality laws to have their convictions declared spent.\n\nThis petition eventually resulted in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, informally known as the Alan Turing law, which serves as an amnesty law to pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts, and which was implemented on 31 January 2017. As the law and the disregard process applies only to England and Wales, groups in Northern Ireland and Scotland have campaigned for equivalent laws in their jurisdictions.\n\nDuring production, there was criticism regarding the film's purported downplaying of Turing's homosexuality, particularly condemning the portrayal of his relationship with close friend and one-time fiancée Joan Clarke. Hodges, author of the book upon which the film was based, described the script as having \"built up the relationship with Joan much more than it actually was\". Turing's niece Payne thought that Knightley was inappropriately cast, as she described the real Clarke as \"rather plain\", and said: \"I think they might be trying to romanticise it. It makes me a bit mad. You want the film to show it as it was, not a lot of nonsense.\"\n\nSpeaking to \"Empire\", director Tyldum expressed his decision to take on the project: \"It is such a complex story. It was the gay rights element, but also how his (Turing's) ideas were kept secret and how incredibly important his work was during the war, that he was never given credit for it\". In an interview for \"GQ UK\", Matthew Goode, who plays fellow cryptographer Hugh Alexander in the film, stated that the script focuses on \"Turing's life and how as a nation we celebrated him as being a hero by chemically castrating him because he was gay\". The producers of the film stated: \"There is not – and never has been – a version of our script where Alan Turing is anything other than homosexual, nor have we included fictitious sex scenes.\"\n\nIn a January 2015 interview with \"The Huffington Post\", its screenwriter Graham Moore said in response to complaints about the film's historical accuracy:\n\nWhen you use the language of \"fact checking\" to talk about a film, I think you're sort of fundamentally misunderstanding how art works. You don't fact check Monet's \"Water Lilies\". That's not what water lilies look like, that's what the sensation of experiencing water lilies feel like. That's the goal of the piece.\n\nIn the same interview, Tyldum stated:\n\nA lot of historical films sometimes feel like people reading a Wikipedia page to you onscreen, like just reciting \"and then he did that, and then he did that, and then he did this other thing\" – it's like a \"Greatest Hits\" compilation. We wanted the movie to be emotional and passionate. Our goal was to give you \"What does Alan Turing feel like?\" What does his story feel like? What'd it feel like to be Alan Turing? Can we create the experience of sort of \"Alan Turing-ness\" for an audience based on his life?\n\nFor the most part, Hodges has not commented on the historical accuracy of the film, alluding to contractual obligations involving the film rights to his biography.\n\nThe following events depicted in the film did not happen in real life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Imitation Game\" has been nominated for, and has received, numerous awards, with Cumberbatch's portrayal of Turing particularly praised. The film and its cast and crew were also honoured by Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT civil rights advocacy group and political lobbying organisation in the United States. \"We are proud to honor the stars and filmmakers of \"The Imitation Game\" for bringing the captivating yet tragic story of Alan Turing to the big screen\", HRC president Chad Griffin said in a statement.\n\n"}

It stands facing Jackson Square, adjacent to the St. Louis Cathedral. Built in 1791 as a matching structure for the Cabildo, which flanks the cathedral on the other side, it is one of the nation's best examples of formal colonial Spanish architecture (with many neo-Renaissance elements). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970, and is now a property of the Louisiana State Museum.\n\nThe Presbytère is located on the northwest side of Jackson Square, between the cathedral and St. Ann Street. It is a two-story brick building, originally built with a flat roof that had a balustrade topped by urns. Its ground floor has a nine-bay open arcade of elliptical arches, with pilastered corners. The upper level also has arched openings, all articulated by pilasters, with multipane windows. The center three bays on both levels have engaged columns on either side, and are topped as a group by a gabled pediment. A dormered mansard roof was added in 1847, which is topped by a louvered cupola.\n\nThe Presbytère was designed in 1791 by the French-born Gilberto Guillemard to match the Cabildo, or Town Hall, on the other side of St. Louis Cathedral. By 1798, only the first floor had been completed, and its second floor was not completed until 1813. Originally called the (‘Ecclesiastical House’), its name derives from the fact that it was built on the former site of the residence of the Capuchin monks and presbytery (rectory, \"\" in French). While intended to house clergy, it was never used as a religious residence. The building initially was used for commercial purposes until 1834, when it was used by the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1853, cathedral officials sold the Presbytère to the city, and in 1908 the city sold it to the state. In 1911 it became part of the Louisiana State Museum. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970.\nIn 2005, the cupola was replaced atop the Presbytère. The cupola had been missing since the New Orleans Hurricane of 1915.\n\n\n"}

The group started to clash with Turkish security forces and tried to enforce their authority in the areas they were located in 2014 as part of a strategy which involved unilateral declaration of autonomy in various towns in Southeast Anatolia, and creation of trenches and barricades reinforced with IEDs and explosives to deny security forces access to the urban areas. \n\nThe group is in favor of regional autonomy or a separate state for the Kurdish people in Southeast Anatolia.
