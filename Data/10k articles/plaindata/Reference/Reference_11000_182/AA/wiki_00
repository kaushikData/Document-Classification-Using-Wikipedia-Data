{"id": "38271554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38271554", "title": "Archival bond", "text": "Archival bond\n\nThe archival bond is a concept in archival theory referring to the relationship that each archival record has with the other records produced as part of the same transaction or activity and located within the same grouping. These bonds are a core component of each individual record and are necessary for transforming a document into a record, as a document will only acquire meaning (and become a record) through its interrelationships with other records.\n\nThe concept of the archival bond is primarily associated with the work of Luciana Duranti, who first proposed the concept, along with Heather MacNeil, as part of research into the integrity of electronic records. The concept of the archival bond emerges from the fact that electronic records are not physically arranged like traditional records. For traditional, analog records, their bond is implicit in their arrangement. But for electronic records, this bond must be made explicit due to the lack of a single sequential order of records in a digital environment.\n\nThe archival bond was one of the core concepts of the subsequent International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems (InterPARES) project and can be found in the InterPARES glossary.\n\nAs Duranti notes, the archival bond is not to be confused with the broader term \"context\" as context exists independent of a record while \"the archival bond is an essential part of the record, which would not exist without it.\"\n"}

As of 2017, Furman has set more than 600 official Guinness Records and currently holds 226 records. His most recent record is 26 watermelons sliced on his stomach in one minute thus holding the record for the most Guinness world records. He has been breaking records since 1979.\n\nFurman was born in 1954 in Brooklyn, New York. He was fascinated with the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" as a child but never thought he could ever break a record, since he was very nonathletic.\n\nThat all changed when, as a teenager, he became interested in spirituality and in 1970 became a devout follower of the spiritual leader Sri Chinmoy.\n\nSri Chinmoy inspired Furman to participate in a 24-hour bicycle race in New York City's Central Park in 1978. With only two weeks' training, Furman tied for third place, cycling . Around this time, he changed his first name to Ashrita (\"protected by God\" in Sanskrit).\n\nIn 1979, Furman set his first official record by doing 27,000 jumping jacks. In 1986, Furman invented and set the record for underwater pogo stick jumping and introduced it on \"Good Morning America\" on April Fools' Day.\n\nFurman has managed a health food store in Jamaica, Queens, New York City, New York since 1982. He is also a tour manager for his meditation group and is therefore able to travel extensively. As of 2014, Furman has set records in 40 countries. He completed his goal of breaking a record in all seven continents when he set the mile hula hoop record at Uluru (also known as Ayers Rock) in the Australian desert in 2003. Furman has also set records at such famous landmarks as the Egyptian pyramids (distance pool cue balancing), Stonehenge (standing on a Swiss ball), the Eiffel Tower (most sit ups in an hour), the Great Wall of China (hopping on a kangaroo ball), Borobudur (Fastest time to run a mile while balancing a milk bottle on the head) and Angkor Wat (jumping rope on a pogo stick). While in China, Furman broke the record for running 8 km (4.97 mi) on stilts in the fastest time (39 min. 56 sec.), a record which had stood since 1982.\n\nFurman has also been a pioneer in setting records in several new activities including landrowing. Using a converted indoor rower with wheels and brakes, Furman rowed in 16 days in Bali in 1991. Furman also developed the sport of gluggling, underwater juggling, which he did for 48 minutes at Kelly Tarlton's Antarctic Encounter and Underwater World in Auckland, New Zealand in 2002 and distance sack racing, which Furman did for a mile while racing against a yak in Mongolia in 2007. On January 30, 2008, Furman unveiled his giant pencil – long, 22,000 pounds (with 4,000 solid pounds of Pennsylvania graphite). The pencil was built in three weeks as a birthday gift for teacher Sri Chinmoy on 27 August 2007. Longer than the pencil outside the Malaysia HQ of stationers Faber-Castell, it was transported from Queens, New York, to the City Museum in St. Louis. In April 2009 Furman became the first person to hold 100 Guinness World Records at once.\n\n\n"}

Live chat and text messaging are available from 10:00 a.m. to midnight EST from Sunday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST on Friday and Saturday; the e-mail form is available to patrons 24 hours per day, seven days per week. As of March 2016, Ask a Librarian has 133 participating institutions including public libraries and library systems, K-12 libraries, and university and college libraries.\n\nAsk a Librarian began as a partnership between the College Center for Library Automation (CCLA) and TBLC in the interest of creating a statewide virtual reference service that would increase the presence of librarians on the internet. In 2002, the organizations successfully applied for a joint grant through the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) and were awarded $339,000 for the development and implementation of their pilot project as a service of the Florida Electronic Library.\n\nThe Ask a Librarian virtual reference service was officially activated on July 28, 2003. Tampa Bay-area libraries were the first to participate, with Pasco County libraries joining shortly afterward. Within the first year of operation, nearly 7,500 Floridians had used the service to get answers from a reference librarian. By August 19, 2007, Ask a Librarian had answered its 100,000th reference question. As of February 2011, Ask a Librarian had logged over 274,000 live virtual reference sessions and e-mail questions.\n\nAsk a Librarian has made several efforts meet user reference needs on smartphones and other mobile devices. In October 2010, Ask a Librarian introduced a text messaging service to accompany their traditional chat service. In 2012, the service introduced a mobile-friendly website interface for tablets and phones. In April 2013, the service also launched the Ask A Librarian Mobile App, a mobile-friendly interface geared toward improving the user chat experience on smartphones and tablets.\n\n"}

{"id": "6828878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6828878", "title": "Diceman (comics)", "text": "Diceman (comics)\n\nDiceman was a short-lived British comic which ran for five issues in 1986. It was a spin-off from \"2000 AD\" and was devised by Pat Mills, who also wrote almost all of the stories. It was edited by Simon Geller, but purported to be edited by a monster called Mervyn. The stories were designed to be played like gamebooks. Each issue contained two or three such stories and was published every two months.\n\nThe comic mostly contained stories based on characters who already appeared regularly in \"2000 AD\". Its eponymous character Diceman, also known as Rick Fortune, was created specially for the comic (by Pat Mills and Graham Manley), but did not appear until the second issue. Fortune was a \"psychic investigator\", a 1930s American private detective with psionic powers. He also had a pair of stone dice, recovered from the ruins of Atlantis, which he could use to summon various powers including a three-headed lizard demon called Astragal to assist him. The \"Diceman\" strip was different from the others in that the reader not only had to avoid being killed, he also ran the risk of being driven insane (if his \"sanity score\" dropped to zero).\n\nThe only other story in the comic which was not derived from \"2000 AD\" was \"You are Ronald Reagan in: \"Twilight's Last Gleaming\"\", a satirical spoof in which the reader, playing the part of the American president, must prevent nuclear war breaking out. In contrast to the strip Diceman, this strip also had a sanity score, but if it got too \"high\", then the Secret Service assume that the president must have been replaced with an imposter (a comment on Reagan's perceived intellectual limitations). This game was exceptionally difficult compared with the others in the comic, as the player must make irrational decisions to avoid arrest and execution, while trying to make the right decisions to prevent a nuclear launch by either side. In fact the player transpires to have very little control over the outcome, and almost every option inevitably results in World War III, suggesting that nuclear diplomacy is very difficult to control once Cold War tensions have begun.\n\nThe other strips which appeared in \"Dice Man\" were \"Judge Dredd, Nemesis the Warlock, Sláine, Rogue Trooper\", \"Torquemada\" and \"ABC Warriors\".\n\n\n\nJudge Dredd<br>\n\"House of Death\"<br>\nIssue: 1<br>\nPages: 20<br>\nStory: John Wagner<br>\nGame: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Bryan Talbot<br>\nDated: February 1986\n\nNemesis The Warlock<br>\n\"The Torture Tube\"<br>\nIssue: 1<br>\nPages: 19<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Kevin O’Neill<br>\nDated: February 1986\n\n\"You Are Torquemada: The Garden Of Alien Delights\"<br>\nIssue: 3<br>\nPages: 20<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Bryan Talbot<br>\nDated: June 1986\n\nSláine<br>\n\"Cauldron Of Blood\"<br>\nIssue: 1<br>\nPages: 19<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: David Lloyd<br>\nDated: February 1986\n\n\"Dragoncorpse\"<br>\nIssue: 2<br>\nPages: 19<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Nik Williams<br>\nDated: April 1986\n\n\"The Ring Of Danu\"<br>\nIssue: 4<br>\nPages: 28<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Mike Collins / Mark Farmer<br>\nDated: August 1986\n\nDiceman<br>\n\"In The Bronx, No-one Can Hear You Scream!\"<br>\nIssue: 2<br>\nPages: 24<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Graham Manley<br>\nDated: April 1986<br>\n\n\"Dark Powers\"<br>\nIssue: 3<br>\nPages: 19<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: John Ridgway<br>\nDated: June 1986\n\n\"Bitter Streets\"<br>\nIssue: 4<br>\nPages: 29<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Steve Dillon<br>\nDated: August 1986\n\n\"Murder One\"<br>\nIssue: 5<br>\nPages: 28<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Steve Dillon<br>\nDated: October 1986\n\nABC Warrior<br>\n\"Volgo The Ultimate Death Machine\"<br>\nIssue: 2<br>\nPages: 11<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Steve Dillon<br>\nDated: April 1986\n\nRogue Trooper<br>\n\"Killothon\"<br>\nIssue: 3<br>\nPages: 19<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Steve Dillon<br>\nDated: June 1986\n\n\"Space Zombies!\"<br>\nIssue: 5<br>\nPages: 15<br>\nStory/Game: Simon Gellar<br>\nArt: Mike Collins<br>\nDated: October 1986\n\nYou Are Ronald Reagan!<br>\n\"Twilight’s Last Gleaming!\"<br>\nIssue: 5<br>\nPages: 17<br>\nStory/Game: Pat Mills<br>\nArt: Hunt Emerson<br>\nDated: October 1986\n"}

Nearly a third of the bishops are missing, and the episcopal succession as given by Chenu was very incomplete. In 1626, Claude Robert, a priest of Langres, published with the approbation of André Fremiot, Archbishop of Bourges, a \"Gallia Christiana\". He entered a large number of churches outside of Gaul, and gave a short history of the metropolitan sees, cathedrals, and abbeys.\n\nTwo brothers de Sainte-Marthe, Scévole (1571–1650) and Louis (1571–1656), appointed royal historiographers of France in 1620, had assisted Chenu and Robert. At the assembly of the French Clergy in 1626, a number of prelates commissioned these brothers to compile a more definitive work. They died before the completion of their work, and it was issued in 1656 by the sons of Scévole de Sainte-Marthe, Pierre de Sainte-Marthe (1618–90), himself historiographer of France, Abel de Sainte-Marthe (1620–71), theologian, and later general of the Oratory, and Nicolas-Charles de Sainte-Marthe (1623–62), prior of Claunay. On 13 September 1656, the Sainte-Marthe brothers were presented to the assembly of the French Clergy, who accepted the dedication of the work on condition that a passage suspected of Jansenism be suppressed. The work formed four volumes in folio, the first for the archdioceses, the second and third for the dioceses, and the fourth for the abbeys, all in alphabetical order. It reproduced a large number of manuscripts. Defects and omissions, however, were obvious. The Sainte-Marthe brothers themselves announced in their preface the early appearance of a second edition corrected and enlarged. \n\nAs early as 1660 the Jesuit Jean Colomb published at Lyons the \"Noctes Blancalandanæ\", which contains certain additions to the work of the Samarthani, as the brothers and their successors are often called. \"The name of Sainte-Marthe\", wrote Voltaire, \"is one of those of which the country has most reason to be proud.\" The edition promised by the Sainte-Marthe brothers did not appear.\n\nIn 1710 the Assembly of the French Clergy offered four thousand livres to Denys de Sainte-Marthe (1650–1725), a Benedictine monk of the Congregation of Saint-Maur, renowned for his polemics against the Trappist Abbé de Rancé on the subject of monastic studies, on condition that he should bring the revision of the \"Gallia Christiana\" to a successful conclusion, that the first volume should appear at the end of four years, and that his Congregation should continue the undertaking after his death. Through his efforts the first volume appeared in 1715, devoted to the ecclesiastical provinces of Albi, Aix, Arles, Avignon, and Auch. In 1720 he produced the second volume dealing with the provinces of Bourges and Bordeaux; and in 1725 the third, which treated Cambrai, Cologne, and Embrun. \n\nAfter his death the Benedictines issued the fourth volume (1728) on Lyons, and the fifth volume (1731) on Mechelen and Mainz. Between 1731 and 1740, on account of the controversies over the Bull \"Unigenitus\", Dom Félix Hodin and Dom Etienne Brice, who were preparing the latter volumes of the \"Gallia Christiana\", were expelled from Saint-Germain-des-Prés. They returned to Paris in 1739 and issued the sixth volume, dealing with Narbonne, also (1744) the seventh and eighth volumes on Paris and its suffragan sees. Père Duplessis united his efforts with theirs, and the ninth and tenth volumes, both on the province of Reims, appeared in 1751. The eleventh volume (1759) dealing with the province of Rouen was issued by Père Pierre Henri and Dom Jacques Taschereau. In 1770 the twelfth volume on the province of Sens and province of Tarentaise appeared, and in 1785 the thirteenth, on the provinces of Toulouse and Trier. \n\nAt the outbreak of the revolution, four volumes were lacking: Tours, Besançon, Utrecht, and Vienne. Barthélemy Hauréau published (in 1856, 1860 and 1865), for the provinces of Tours, Besançon and Vienne, respectively, and according to the Benedictine method, the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth volumes of the \"Gallia Christiana\". \n\nThe province of Utrecht alone has no place in this great collection, but this defect has been remedied in part by the \"Bullarium Trajectense\", edited by Gisbert Brom, and extending from the earliest times to 1378 (The Hague, 1891–96). \n\nThe new \"Gallia Christiana\", of which volumes I to V and XI to XIII were reprinted by Dom Paul Piolin between 1870 and 1877, and volumes VI to IX and XII by the publisher H. Welter, places after each metropolitan see its suffragan sees, and after each see the abbeys belonging to it. The original documents, instead of encumbering the body of the articles, are inserted at the end of each diocese under in a section titled \"Instrumenta\". This colossal work does great honour to the Benedictines and to the Sainte-Marthe family. \"The name of Sainte-Marthe\", wrote Voltaire, \"is one of those of which the country has most reason to be proud.\"\n\nIn 1774 the Abbé Hugues du Temps, vicar-general of Bordeaux, undertook in seven volumes an abridgement of the \"Gallia\" under the title \"Le clergé de France\" of which only four volumes appeared. About 1867 Honoré Fisquet undertook the publication of an episcopal history of France (\"La France Pontificale\"), in which, for the early period, he utilized the \"Gallia\", at the same time bringing the history of each diocese down to modern times. Twenty-two volumes appeared. \n\nCanon Albanès projected a complete revision of the \"Gallia Christiana\", each ecclesiastical province to form a volume. Albanès, who was one of the first scholars to search the Lateran and Vatican libraries, in his efforts to determine the initial years of some episcopal reigns, found occasionally either the acts of election or the Bulls of provision. He hoped in this way to remove certain suppositious bishops who had been introduced to fill gaps in the catalogues, but died in 1897 before the first volume appeared. Through the use of his notes and the efforts of Canon Ulysse Chevalier three addition volumes of this \"Gallia Christiana (novissima)\", treating Arles, Aix, and Marseilles, appeared at Montbéliard.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "155687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155687", "title": "Ital", "text": "Ital\n\nItal, also spelled I-tal (), is food often celebrated by those in the Rastafari movement. It is compulsory in the Nyabinghi mansion though not in the Twelve Tribes of Israel or Remi mansions. The word derives from the English word \"vital\", with the initial \"v\" removed. This is done to many words in the Rastafari vocabulary to signify the unity of the speaker with all of nature. The expression of Ital eating varies widely from Rasta to Rasta, and there are few universal rules of Ital living.\n\nThe primary goal of adhering to an Ital diet is to increase Livity, or the life energy that Rastafari generally believe lives within all human beings, as conferred from the Almighty. A common tenet of Rastafari beliefs is the sharing of a central Livity among living things, and what is put into one's body should enhance Livity rather than reduce it. Though there are different interpretations of ital regarding specific foods, the general principle is that food should be natural, or pure, and from the earth; Rastafari therefore often avoid food which is chemically modified or contains artificial additives (e.g., colour, flavourings, and preservatives). Some also avoid added salt in foods, especially salt with the artificial addition of iodine, while pure sea or kosher salt is eaten by some. In strict interpretations, foods that have been produced using chemicals such as pesticides and fertilizer are not considered ital. Early adherents adopted their dietary laws based on their interpretation of several books of the Bible, including the Book of Genesis (\"Then God said, \"I give you every Seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.\" (Genesis 1:29)), the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Along with growing dreadlocks and the sacramental smoking of ganja, observing a vegetarian diet is one of the practices early Rastafari adopted from Indian indentured servants living in Jamaica. Rastafari's founder Leonard Howell, affectionately called \"Gong\" and \"Gyangunguru Maragh\", though not of Indian descent, was fascinated with Hindu practices and was instrumental in promoting a plant-based diet in the Rastafari community of Pinnacle.\n\nMost expressions of the Ital diet include adherence to a strict vegetarian diet. This is based in part on the belief that since meat is dead, eating it would therefore work against Livity elevation. It is also practiced because as strict adherents to natural living, Rastafarian often believe the human being is a natural vegetarian based on human physiology and anatomy. Some adherents to Ital diets are strict vegans, as they do not consider dairy to be natural for human consumption either.\n\nThe most strict interpretations also avoid the consumption of rock salt (sea salt can be substituted), and food that has been preserved by canning or drying, and even prohibit the use of metal cooking utensils. In this case, only clay and wood cooking pots, crockery, and cutlery are used. Few adherents of ital follow the strictest interpretation; some Rastafarian do not adhere to them at all.\n\nRastafarians do not approve of excessive alcohol consumption. However they can drink alcohol in moderation as long as it does not reach a level that clouds the mind or reduces their livity. Most Rastafari disapprove of cigarettes due to the serious health concerns associated with their use, and many Rastafari avoid coffee and other caffeinated beverages, though this is less common. In fact some Rastafari grow their own coffee, sugar, and chocolate.\n\n"}

The mine has been written about by local historians and various magazines. Many have searched for the lost placer mine of Jolly Jack. It is a local legend in the Boundary Country.\n\nA prospector named Jack Thornton had been prospecting many creeks around the city of Greenwood, British Columbia. Jack Thornton was also known as \"Jolly Jack\" and had been in the US Navy at one time. Thornton lived in a cabin located near Boundary Creek. Thornton discovered a source of placer gold somewhere near Greenwood around 1900. The gold discovered was coarse and heavy with nuggets weighing an ounce. This gold was red and heavily oxidized like dark copper. Thornton never revealed the location of the source of his placer gold. In 1967, May Jones, one of Thornton's surviving daughters left an account at the Greenwood Museum. May states \"My mother told me that my father really had found something very rich, but where it was he took to the great beyond with him. It was in the spring of the year. He left home in the morning and was back at night and he had a baking powder can full of nuggets when he came home. He was old and so was his horse so he could not have gone far. She said he told her that they had struck it rich at last, but he never told mother where it was, or anyone else. Many have looked for it but none have ever found the place yet.\"\n\nThornton lived on Boundary Creek and mined many creeks in the area. Local historian Bill Barlee speculates the lost mine could not have been Rock Creek or its tributaries such as Jolly, McKinney and Baker because that round trip would require two days travel from Jack's Cabin. The Kettle River and Boundary Creek could not be the location because the gold was too fine and sparse when compared to Thornton's gold. Bill Barlee believes the area where Jack found his gold was Fourth of July Creek with its tributaries. A local prospector in Greenwood named Peter den Hartog claimed he found Jolly Jack's lost mine. The gold Hartog found in Skeff Creek matched the characteristics of Jack's gold. Skeff Creek is a tributary of Fourth of July Creek and is the reputed location of Jolly Jack's lost mine.\n\nSome skeptics claim Thornton did not have a lost source of placer gold. E. Jacobs wrote about Thornton following his death. The account was written in the May, 1903 issue of the \"Mining Record\". The article does not indicate that Jack ever had any secret placer location or \"lost mine\". Thornton lived on a periodical pension allowance from the US government. Ms. Thornton took in daywork and washing to support the family. This account does not indicate someone who had an unlimited amount of gold at their disposal. Some local prospectors believe Jolly Jack had gold stashed from older claims he once worked. This cache was to keep prospectors from spying on his tunnel operations. In 1865 Jolly Jack wing-dammed a location where Salmon Creek emptied into the Pen d’Oreille near junction with Columbia at Fort Shephard. Jack recovered a lot of gold from this location and may have cached some it. On April 3, 1903 Jack Thornton died.\n\n"}

{"id": "100119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100119", "title": "Matsya", "text": "Matsya\n\nMatsya (, lit. \"fish\"), is the fish avatar in the ten primary avatars of Hindu god Vishnu. Matsya is described to have rescued Manu and earthly existence from a great deluge. \n\nThe earliest accounts of Matsya as a fish-saviour equates him with the Vedic deity Prajapati. The fish-savior later merges with the identity of Brahma in post-Vedic era, and still later as an avatar of Vishnu. The legends associated with Matsya expand, evolve and vary in Hindu texts. These legends have embedded symbolism, where a small fish with Manu's protection grows to become a big fish, and the fish saves earthly existence.\n\nMatsya iconography sometimes is zoomorphic as a giant fish with horn, or anthropomorphic in the form of a human torso connected to the rear half of a fish.\n\n\"Matsya\" is a Sanskrit word and means \"fish\". The term appears in the \"Rigveda\". It is related to \"maccha\", which also means fish.\n\nThe section 1.8.1 of the \"Shatapatha Brahmana\" (\"Yajur veda\") is the earliest extant text to mention Matsya and the flood myth in Hinduism. It makes no mention of Vishnu, instead identifies the fish with Prajapati-Brahma. The central characters of this legend are the fish (Matsya) and Manu. The character Manu is presented as the legislator and the ancestor king. One day, water is brought to Manu for his ablutions. In the water is a tiny fish. The fish states it fears being swallowed by a larger fish and appeals to Manu to protect him. In return, the fish promises to rescue Manu from an impending flood. Manu accepts the request. He puts the fish in a pot of water where he grows. Then he prepares a ditch filled with water, and transfers him there where it can grow freely. Once the fish grows further to be big enough to be free from danger, Manu transfers him into ocean. The fish thanks him, tells him the date of the great flood, and asks Manu to build a boat by that day, one he can attach to its horn. On the predicted day, Manu visits the fish with his boat. The devastating floods come, Manu ties the boat to the horn. The fish carries the boat with Manu to the high grounds of the northern mountains (interpreted as Himalayas). Manu then re-establishes life by performing austerities and by performing yajna (sacrifices).\n\nAccording to Bonnefoy, the Vedic story is symbolic. The little fish alludes to the Indian \"law of the fishes\", an equivalent to the \"law of the jungle\". The small and weak would be devoured by the big and strong, and needs the dharmic protection of the legislator and king Manu to enable it to attain its potential and help later. Manu provides the protection, the little fish grows to become big and ultimately saves all existence. The boat that Manu builds to get help from the savior fish, states Bonnefoy, is symbolism of the means to avert complete destruction and for human salvation. The mountains are symbolism for the doorway for ultimate refuge and liberation.\n\nThe tale of Matsya appears in chapter 12.187 of the Book 3, the \"Vana Parva\", in the epic \"Mahabharata\". The legend begins with Manu performing religious rituals on the banks of the Cherivi River. A little fish called \"Matsyaka\" comes to him and asks for his protection, promising to save him from a deluge in the future. The legend moves in the same vein as the Vedic version. Manu places him in the jar. Once it outgrows it, the fish asks to be put into tank which Manu helps with. Then the fish outgrows the tank, and with Manu's help reaches the Ganges River, finally to the ocean. Manu is asked by the fish, in the Mahabharata version, to build a ship and be in it with Rishis (sages) and all sorts of grains, on the day of the expected deluge. Manu accepts the fish's advice. The deluge begins, the fish arrives to Manu's aid. He ties the ship to the fish, who then steers the ship to the Himalayas, carrying Manu through a turbulent storm. The danger passes. The fish then reveals himself as Brahma, and gives the power of creation to Manu.\n\nThe key difference between the Vedic version and the Mahabharata version of the allegorical legend is the latter's identification of Matsya with Brahma, more explicit discussion of the \"law of the fishes\" where the weak needs the protection from the strong, and the fish asking Manu to bring along sages and grains.\n\nAccording to George Williams, there are many versions of the Matsya mythology in the Puranas. The names of the characters, the details, the plot and the message diverge in this genre of texts.\n\nThe \"Matsya Purana\" evolves the legend further, by identifying the fish-savior (Matsya) with Vishnu instead of Brahma. The Purana derives its name from Matsya.\n\nThe legend as it appears in section 1.12 states that when a little fish appears to Manu, he recognizes Vishnu Vasudeva in the fish. The fish tells him about the impending fiery end of \"kalpa\" accompanied with a deluge. The fish once again has a horn, but Manu does not need to build a boat or ship in this Purana. The gods build it. They build it big enough to carry and save all life forms, and Manu needs to just carry all types of grain seeds to produce food for everyone after the deluge is over. When the great flood begins, Manu ties the Ananta Sesha (cosmic serpent) to the fish's horn. The fish carries everyone to safety. According to Bonnefoy, the Matsya Puranic story is also symbolic though quite different. The fish is divine to begin with, and needs no protection, only recognition and devotion. It also ties the story to its cosmology, connecting two kalpas through the cosmic symbolic residue in the form of \"Sesha\".\n\nIn another version of the \"Matsya Purana\", the story is closer to the Mahabharata version. At the end of Kalpa, Brahma is resting and a demon Hayagriva steals the Vedas. Vishnu discovers the theft. He descends to earth in the form of a little fish, or the Matsya avatar. One day, the king of Dravida desha (South India) named Satyavrata cups water in his hand to offer it to his ancestors. There he finds a little fish. The fish asks him to save him from predators and let him grow. Satyavrata is filled with compassion for the little fish. He puts the fish in a pot, from there to a well, then a tank, and when it outgrows the tank, he transfers the fish finally to sea. The fish rapidly outgrows the sea. Satyavrata realizes this is no ordinary fish, and asks the fish, \"who are you?\" The fish identifies itself as Vishnu, and informs the king of the impending deluge. The king is asked to save one member of every species of animal, plant and seeds in a boat and along with all this, a copy of the Vedas. The fish asks the king to tie the boat to its fins with the help of \"Sesha\" serpent. The deluge comes. The fish avatar saves existence. A new cycle of life restarts after the great deluge ends.\n\nThe \"Bhagavata Purana\" presents a modified version for the Matsya mythology. The story is presented through a character named Badarayani. At the end of a \"kalpa\", as the world dissolved and was overwhelmed by a flooding ocean, the demon Hayagriva (\"horse-faced\" asura) steals the Vedas from sleepy Brahma. Vishnu takes the avatar of \"saphari\" fish, dives down to locate the Vedas and the demon, recovers the Vedas from the ocean.\n\nIn another version of the \"Bhagavata Purana\" text, the man-fish avatar of Vishnu not only recovers the Vedas from the demon Hayagriva who stole and tried to destroy it, but the avatar also saves the sage Satyavrata, the \"Saptarishis\" (seven sages), animals, seeds of all plant species. In this version of the legend, while swimming and carrying them all to safety, the fish avatar teaches the highest knowledge to the \"rishis\" and Satyavrata to prepare them for the next cycle of existence.\n\nThe \"Agni Purana\" version presents the legend through Agni (fire deity) describing the story to sage Vasishtha. Agni describes how god Hari (Vishnu) saved the good from the evil through his fish avatar. As Brahma starts to sleep, an asura steals the Vedas. Meanwhile, Vaivasvata Manu was making his religious offering in Kritamala River, when a small fish appeared in his hand. The fish asked Manu to protect him from larger fishes. Manu accepts the request, puts the fish in a jar. When the fish outgrows it, Manu puts it in a pond, then a lake, finally into the sea. Once there, the fish instantly expands to a gigantic size. Manu then realizes that the fish is Vishnu Narayana, and accepts he was deluded previously. The fish then informs the king that a flood is coming in seven days, to go collect all kinds of seeds and the seven sages, then board the boat that has been made for him. Manu does so. The fish with horn appears. They tie the boat to the horn and the fish saves them. The fish then finds the asura Hayagriva, slays him, recovers the Vedas and gives it to seven sages and Manu.\n\nMatsya is generally enlisted as the first avatar of Vishnu, especially in Dashavatara (ten major avatars of Vishnu) lists. However, that was not always the case. Some lists do not list Matsya as first, only later texts start the trend of Matsya as the first avatar.\n\nMatsya is depicted in two forms: as a zoomorphic fish or in an anthropomorphic form. In the latter form, the upper half is that of the four-armed man and the lower half is a fish. The upper half resembles Vishnu and wears the traditional ornaments and the \"kirita-makuta\" (tall conical crown) as worn by Vishnu. He holds in two of his hands the \"Sudarshana chakra\" (discus) and a \"shankha\" (conch), the usual weapons of Vishnu. The other two hands make the gestures of \"varadamudra\", which grants boons to the devotee, and \"abhayamudra\", which reassures the devotee of protection. In another configuration, he might have all four attributes of Vishnu, namely the \"Sudarshana chakra\", a \"shankha\", a gada (mace) and a lotus. \n\nIn some representations, Matsya is shown with four hands like Vishnu, one holding the chakra, another the shankha, while the front two hands hold a sword and a book signifying the Vedas he recovered from the demon. Over his elbows is an angavastra draped, while a \"dhoti\" like draping covers his hips.\n\nIn rare representations, his lower half is human while the upper body (or just the face) is of a fish. The fish-face version is found in a relief at the Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura.\n\nMatsya may be depicted alone or in a scene depicting his combat with a demon. A demon called Shankhasura emerging from a conch is sometimes depicted attacking Matsya with a sword as Matsya combats or kills him. Both of them may be depicted in the ocean, while the god Brahma and/or manuscripts or four men, symbolizing the Vedas may be depicted in the background.\n\nThe story of a great Deluge is found in many civilizations across the earth. It is often related to the Genesis narrative of the flood and Noah's Ark. The fish motif reminds readers of the Biblical 'Jonah and the Whale' narrative as well; this fish narrative, as well as the saving of the scriptures from a demon, are specifically Hindu traditions of this style of the flood narrative. Similar flood myths also exist in tales from ancient Sumer and Babylonia, Greece, the Maya of Americas and the Yoruba of Africa.\nMatsya is believed to symbolise the aquatic life as the first beings on earth. Another symbolic interpretation of the Matsya mythology is, states Bonnefoy, to consider Manu's boat to represent moksha (salvation), which helps one to cross over. The Himalayas are treated as a boundary between the earthly existence and land of salvation beyond. The protection of the fish and its horn represent the sacrifices that help guide Manu to salvation. Treated as a parable, the tale advises a good king should protect the weak from the mighty, reversing the \"law of fishes\" and uphold dharma, like Manu, defines an ideal king. In the tales where the demon hides the Vedas, dharma is threatened and Vishnu as the divine Saviour, rescues dharma, aided by his earthly counterpart, Manu - the king.\n\nThere are very few temples dedicated to Matsya. Prominent ones include the Shankhodara temple in Bet Dwarka and Vedanarayana Temple in Nagalapuram. The Koneswaram Matsyakeswaram temple in Trincomalee is now destroyed. Matsya Narayana Temple, Bangalore also exists.\n\n\n"}

In Portland, Oregon, he received the name \"Mad Dog\" Vachon. In the early 1960s, Vachon became a main eventer in the American Wrestling Association. He was one of the promotion's all-time great heels, known for his wild style and intense interviews. He was a five-time AWA World Heavyweight Champion. Starting in the 1970s, Vachon became a fan favourite, particularly in his home province of Quebec.\n\nAfter a stint in the World Wrestling Federation, Vachon retired from the business in 1986. The following year, he was struck by a hit-and-run driver, resulting in the amputation of one of his legs. Vachon was highly influential, especially in Canada, and was inducted into numerous professional wrestling Halls of Fame.\n\nJoseph Maurice Régis Vachon was born on September 14, 1929. The godfather was Maurice Picard, his uncle and the godmother was Victoria Ouellet, his maternal grandmother; he was the second child of 13 children of Montreal policeman Ferdinand Vachon and Marguerite Picard. He grew up in the district of Ville-Émard, a working-class borough southwest of Montreal, Quebec. As a child, he regularly attended wrestling shows at the nearby Montreal Forum, where he grew up idolizing local ring legend Yvon Robert; and at just 12 years old, he had already begun grappling at the area's YMCA. At the YMCA he was coached by Frank Saxton, a former coach of the Canadian amateur team. Vachon entered a wrestling course advertised at the back of a comic book, and he began training under Chief Jim Crowley. He trained hard and even worked in the docks and on the canal to build up his muscle. By age 14, Vachon eventually established himself among Canada's premier amateur grapplers.\n\nAt the age of 18, he competed in the 1948 Olympic Games in London, where he pinned the Indian champion in 58 seconds. Vachon ultimately finished in seventh place at 174 pounds after losing to eventual silver medalist Adil Candemir of Turkey. Moreover, it was at the 1948 Olympics where Vachon first encountered an American Greco-Roman competitor named Verne Gagne. He rebounded to win the gold medal at the 1950 British Empire Games in New Zealand. He then spent several years working as a bouncer at a Montreal nightclub, where he gained a reputation of being willing to fight anyone, before he was encouraged to join the pro wrestling circuit in 1951.\n\nVachon initially debuted as a junior heavyweight for Ontario booker Larry Kasaboski; and during his first year as a pro, he won a tournament in Sudbury to claim the North American Junior Heavyweight Title. However, Vachon soon encountered a roadblock when powerful Montreal promoter Eddie Quinn was hesitant to use him for fear that Vachon would dethrone Yvon Robert, who was still his top drawing card. Consequently, Vachon then took to the road; and in April 1955, he teamed with Pierre LaSalle to capture the NWA Texas Tag Team Titles.\n\nDespite his exceptional grappling ability, Maurice Vachon nonetheless struggled to distinguish himself from the myriad of image-less grapplers during his early years. As a result, he soon took radical measures to differentiate his persona, bulking up to a more plausible 225 pounds while also shaving his head bald and growing a long goatee. In addition, Vachon would frequently buy local TV time prior to a weekend event, which he then used to boldly proclaim his supremacy while also deprecating his opponent. Such acts of bravado were considered revolutionary at the time, though it was successful in that it attracted attention to Vachon’s new character as well as drawing additional fans to the arena. As a result, Vachon subsequently established himself as a major heel while also portraying a wrestling beast inside the ring who would freely stomp, bite, and pound his opponent into submission. According to Vachon, the name \"Mad Dog\" was given to him in 1962 by Portland promoter Don Owen after a particularly violent match. \"During the match I went outside the ring and started to turn everything upside down. A policeman tried to stop me and I hit him too,\" said Vachon. Afterwards Owen told him, \"You just looked like a real mad dog out there.\"\n\nBefore long, \"Mad Dog\" Vachon consequently developed a reputation as perhaps the most feared rulebreaker in all of wrestling. Furthermore, Maurice's younger brother Paul - ultimately known as \"The Butcher\" - soon also made his debut and on February 17, 1959 the Vachon brothers teamed to defeat Chico Garcia and Chet Wallick for the NWA Canadian Tag Team Titles. Vachon's tendency to hurt his opponents with foreign objects, filed fingernails and teeth, and the multiple use of his signature finishing move, the Piledriver, to end matches made him notorious in the business and caused him to be banned in three U.S. states. But it also made his popularity soar among the fans.\n\nHe also met his future wife Kathie Joe at a wrestling event, after spitting a shoe string he had used for choking his opponent at her, as she was sitting in the audience.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Mad Dog Vachon was then recruited to the Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association by his old Olympics acquaintance Verne Gagne, who had replaced Tony Stecher as the region’s chief promoter in 1960 and who also served as its centerpiece champion. Upon debuting, Vachon immediately established himself among the promotion’s top box-office draws as fans despised his vicious, mauling tactics; and he thus made the perfect opponent for the All-American Gagne, as the two rivals soon commenced an ongoing battle that would persist on for nearly 20 years. On May 2, 1964, Vachon stunned audiences when he upset Gagne for the AWA World Heavyweight Title, and although Gagne regained the belt just two weeks later, Mad Dog again recaptured the title when he defeated Gagne on October 20 in Minneapolis. Between 1964-67, Mad Dog Vachon would ultimately hold five reigns as the AWA World Champion while taking on all comers within the promotion's massive territory, including Gagne, Mighty Igor Vodic, as well as the legendary powerhouse duo of Crusher Lisowski and Dick the Bruiser.\n\nMad Dog Vachon’s final AWA title reign came to an end on February 26, 1967, at the hands of his nemesis Verne Gagne; and he then briefly left the promotion in order to return to his native Montreal territory, where he captured two reigns as the IWA International Heavyweight Champion while feuding against Johnny Rougeau and Hans Schmidt. Moreover, Vachon would also leverage his close friendship with Montreal Canadiens legend Jean Beliveau to convince the authorities of the Montreal Forum to grant him a promoting license (despite the protests of Johnny Rougeau and Bob Langevin, who had taken over the region from Eddie Quinn during the mid-1960s). Nevertheless, Vachon would soon return to the AWA, where he resumed his fierce battles with The Crusher and Dick the Bruiser, regarded by some as the greatest tag team of all-time, while forming a highly successful and dangerous tandem with his brother Paul \"Butcher\" Vachon. On August 30, 1969, the Vachons defeated Crusher & Bruiser for the AWA World Tag Team Titles; and the following year, the two battled again in a famous steel cage match at Chicago’s Comiskey Park (where the Vachons again emerged victorious), as their violent fights ultimately served as the precursor for a new brand of sadistic and vicious brawling that would spawn future mayhem stars like Abdullah the Butcher, Bruiser Brody, Stan Hansen, and others.\n\nOn July 14, 1973, Vachon had a match with Killer Kowalski for Grand Prix Wrestling at Montreal's Jarry Park. The match drew a crowd of 29,127, which is the largest wrestling crowd in Quebec history. Prior to the match, Vachon had vowed to commit suicide if he didn't win. Following Vachon's victory, the headline of a Montreal newspaper read \"Vachon triumphs in front of 30,000 people and gives up on suicide!\"\n\nThe Vachon family became prominent in the AWA with sister Vivian dominating the women's scene, while Maurice and Paul ruled the men's division. In the early 1970s he even appeared alongside Vivian in the motion picture \"Wrestling Queen\". After two decades as one the wrestling's most evil characters, the fans began to rally behind the \"Mad Dog\" in the late 1970s when he formed an unexpected and odd friendship with ex-archrival Verne Gagne. The unlikely partners made for an impressive tag team, and on June 6, 1979, they beat Pat Patterson & Ray Stevens to capture the AWA tag titles, which they held for over a year before losing to Jesse Ventura & Adrian Adonis. When the AWA began looking to younger stars like Rick Martel and Curt Hennig, Vachon jumped to the World Wrestling Federation in 1983. While his age and lack of size did not make for a good mix in the emerging \"Hulkamania\" era, the now-face (fan favorite) Vachon was usually included at WWF house shows (wrestling cards) in the Midwest and Quebec. He wrestled for the WWF in Canada regularly until 1986, and even contributed to the WWF's French programming by doing a weekly interview segment in French titled \"Le Brunch a Mad Dog\". While contracted with the WWF, Vachon was allowed to participate in events not featuring the WWF while in Canada.\n\nIn 1985, he appeared as cornerman for AWA World Champion Rick Martel when Martel was challenged by Boris Zhukov in several title bouts in Canada, getting involved in one match on September 19, 1985 in Winnipeg and fighting off Zhukov and his manager, Chris Markoff, after Markoff interfered and helped Zhukov attack Martel, while in a later rematch between Martel and Zhukov held in a steel cage on November 14, 1985 in the same city, Markoff was neutralized by being handcuffed to Vachon. Vachon received a retirement show in his native Montreal in September 1986, and he left the sport as one its most beloved fan favorites after spending almost his entire career as a sadistic villain. His innovative portrayal of a snarling, bloodthirsty monster would inspire a myriad of future \"psychotic\" wrestlers. According to the WWE, \"In later years, Mad Dog's legacy was carried on by his niece, the memorably twisted Luna Vachon, and notable brawlers who adopted Vachon's wild ring style like Bruiser Brody and George \"The Animal\" Steele.\"\n\nVachon was known for his wild personality and uncontrollable character, as well as his unique interview style. \"He was the first wrestler to understand the power of television. He was the first wrestler to speak to the camera. That was never done before.\" said Yves Theriault, who directed a documentary on Vachon in 2009. Vachon was also very influential in his home province of Quebec. Pat LaPrade, author of the \"Mad Dogs, Midgets and Screw Jobs\", a book on Quebec wrestling history, considers Vachon one of the two most important Quebec wrestlers along with Yvon Robert. He added, \"[Vachon is] the best-known Quebec wrestler outside of Quebec. A legend.\"\n\nIn the book \"The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Canadians\", author Greg Oliver ranks Vachon fourth amongst Canadian wrestlers, behind Whipper Billy Watson, Yvon Robert and Killer Kowalski. Vachon was also included in Oliver's book on villainous wrestlers and was ranked fourth.\n\nUpon retiring, Vachon settled in Carter Lake, Iowa with his third wife Kathy Joe. Tragedy struck in 1987 when Vachon was struck by a hit-and-run driver, resulting in the amputation of one of his legs. It was later revealed that he had been struck by a developmentally challenged male driving the country roads looking for cans to recycle while Vachon was out for a morning jog. The man apparently had no insurance and was never charged. The Vachons moved to Omaha shortly thereafter. He later turned to acting in beer commercials and was a restaurant critic for a Quebec City television station.\n\nHe appeared at the WWF pay-per-view , that was held in Omaha. He was sitting in the front row near ringside, when his artificial leg was ripped off by wrestler Diesel and used as a weapon by Shawn Michaels. In addition, he and longtime rival The Crusher made an appearance at the 1998 Over the Edge pay-per-view, in a segment where the two legends were mocked by Jerry Lawler, including Lawler trying to steal the artificial leg. Crusher and Mad Dog then punched Lawler out of the ring. He had knee surgery in 2008. On March 27, 2010, he was inducted into the 2010 WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nVachon died in his sleep on November 21, 2013, at the age of 84. He had six children, seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. His remains were cremated.\n\nOn November 28,2018 Vachon was posthumously inducted into the Omaha Pro Wrestling Hall Of Fame at the PWP Live \"Wrestlerama\" event at The Waiting Room Lounge in Omaha\n\n\n\n"}

It is a zero-configuration service, using essentially the same programming interfaces, packet formats and operating semantics as the unicast Domain Name System (DNS). Although Stuart Cheshire designed mDNS as a stand-alone protocol, it can work in concert with standard DNS servers.\n\nThe mDNS protocol is published as , uses IP multicast User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, and is implemented by the Apple Bonjour and open source Avahi software packages. Android contains an mDNS implementation. mDNS has also been implemented in Windows 10, but its use there is limited to discovering networked printers.\n\nmDNS can work in conjunction with DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), a companion zero-configuration technique specified separately in RFC 6763.\n\nWhen an mDNS client needs to resolve a host name, it sends an IP multicast query message that asks the host having that name to identify itself. That target machine then multicasts a message that includes its IP address. All machines in that subnet can then use that information to update their mDNS caches.\n\nAny host can relinquish its claim to a domain name by sending a response packet with a time to live (TTL) equal to zero.\n\nBy default, mDNS only and exclusively resolves host names ending with the codice_1 top-level domain (TLD). This can cause problems if that domain includes hosts which do not implement mDNS but which can be found via a conventional unicast DNS server. Resolving such conflicts requires network-configuration changes that violate the zero-configuration goal.\n\nAn mDNS message is a multicast UDP packet sent to the following locations:\n\nThe payload structure is based on the unicast DNS packet format, consisting of two parts—the header and the data.\n\nThe header is identical to that found in unicast DNS, as are the sub-sections in the data part: queries, answers, authoritative-nameservers, and additional records.\n\nThe number of records in each sub-section matches the value of the corresponding *COUNT field in the header.\nThe wire format for records in the query section is slightly modified from that in unicast DNS, adding one single-bit field.\nAs in unicast DNS, the QNAME field consists of a series of length/value sub-fields called \"labels\". Each label represents one of the dot-separated substrings in a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The list is terminated by a single null-byte, representing the \"root\" of the DNS.\n\nThe UNICAST-RESPONSE field is used to minimize unnecessary broadcasts on the network: if the bit is set, responders SHOULD send a directed-unicast response directly to the inquiring node rather than broadcasting the response to the entire network.\n\nThe QCLASS field is identical to that found in unicast DNS.\n\nAll records in the answers, authoritative-nameservers, and additional records sections have the same format and are collectively known as \"Resource Records\" (RR).\n\nResource Records in mDNS also have a slightly modified general format from unicast DNS:\nThe CACHE-FLUSH bit is used to instruct neighbor-nodes that the record should overwrite, rather than be appended onto, any existing cached entries for this RRNAME and RRTYPE.\n\nThe formats of the RDATA fields are the same as those found in unicast DNS. However, DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), the most common use-case for mDNS, specifies slight modifications to some of their formats (notably TXT records).\n\nTrying to codice_2 the codice_3 host would cause an mDNS client computer to multicast the following UDP packet:\n\nThe appletv.local host would respond by multicasting its mDNS response packet. For example:\n\nIn its header, the non-zero fields are the codice_4 word (84 00), the codice_5 word (00 01), and the codice_6 word (00 02). The data again begin with the FQDN (hex 07 61 70 70 6c 65 74 76 05 6c 6f 63 61 6c 00 for appletv.local), followed by that host's DNS information:\n\n\n\n"}

Its goals are to standardize the access points in bibliographic catalogues, to improve communication among catalogues and mainly, to make easier the information research and retrieval. CANTIC gives a special treatment to name and title authorities related with Catalan culture. These authorities receive a complete authority work and provide, eventually, access to the Enciclopèdia Catalana.\n\nCANTIC has the aim to be the catalogue of authority records created cooperatively by Catalan libraries. These records have to be generated from the authority control of name, name-title and title access points of Catalan bibliographic records. This guarantees the standardization and uniqueness of access points of catalogues, which makes it easier the exchange and a more efficient communication of bibliographic records and, in the end, enables users to carry out assisted, precise and exhaustive searches. \nCANTIC is a national service that allows to standardize and give consistency to the catalogues of the Catalan library system; it is the tool that facilitates the creation of the future Unique Catalogue of Catalonia (CUC), devised in the frame of the Agreement of the Catalan Government of 20 July 2004, for the improvement and modernization of Catalan Library System\n\nAt a meeting held on 16 September 2002, the Advisory Commission of Cataloguing, the advisory body of the Biblioteca de Catalunya in terms of cataloguing, talked about the need of creating a list of authorities in Catalonia. It was decided to establish a subcommittee to study the technical feasibility of the project and to prepare the requirements and functionality of the list of name and title authorities, taking into account the real needs of the Catalan Library System. The Subcommittee met for the first time on 27 March 2003 and finished the job in October 2003. In the report prepared by them are presented:\nThe Name and Title Authority File of Catalonia was created following the Catalan Library System Act, Llei 4/1993 “La Biblioteca de Catalunya supervisa, valida i unifica en un sol llistat el catàleg d’autoritats\"\n\nThe participants are the Biblioteca de Catalunya, the Casa Àsia, the Centre de Lectura (Reus), the Consorci de Bibliothèques de les Universitats de Catalunya, the Il•lustre Col•legi d'Advocats de Barcelona, the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, the Universitat de Barcelona, the Universitat de Girona, the Universitat de Lleida, the Universitat de Vic, the Universitat Jaume I, the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, the Universitat Pompeu Fabra and the Universitat Rovira i Virgili.\n\nThe authority records of CANTIC are created following the international cataloguing principles and the specifications of the Biblioteca de Catalunya, which were approved by the CCUC. Records are encoded with MARC 21. There is also a CANTIC guide with the procedure for elaborating the authority records by the entities involved. The Bibliographic Standardization Service is responsible for providing training and support to all participants while ensuring the quality of authority records. The constant introduction of new authority records turns CANTIC into a living organism in a permanent process of transformation and change. Updating the content of the database is done monthly and is available on the website of the Biblioteca de Catalunya.\n\n"}

{"id": "1261294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1261294", "title": "Road to Bali", "text": "Road to Bali\n\nRoad to Bali is a 1952 American comedy film directed by Hal Walker and starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. Released by Paramount Pictures on November 1, 1952, the film is the sixth of the seven \"Road to …\" movies. It was the only such movie filmed in Technicolor and was the first to feature surprise cameo appearances from other well-known stars of the day.\n\nGeorge (Bing Crosby) and Harold (Bob Hope), American song-and-dance men performing in Melbourne, Australia, leave in a hurry to avoid various marriage proposals. They end up in Darwin, where they take jobs as deep sea divers for a prince. They are taken by boat to an idyllic island on the way to Bali, Indonesia. They vie for the favors of exotic (and half-Scottish) Princess Lala (Dorothy Lamour), a cousin of the Prince (Murvyn Vye). A hazardous dive produces a chest of priceless jewels, which the Prince plans to claim as his own.\n\nAfter escaping from the Prince and his henchmen, the three are shipwrecked and washed up on another island. Lala is now in love with both of the boys and can't decide which to choose. However, once the natives find them, she learns that in their society, a woman may take multiple husbands, and declares she will marry them both. While the boys are prepared for the ceremony, both thinking the other man lost, plans are changed. She's being unwillingly wed to the already much-married King (Leon Askin), while the boys end up married to each other.\n\nDispleased with the arrangement, a volcano god initiates a massive eruption. After fleeing, the three end up on yet another beach where Lala chooses George over Harold. An undaunted Harold conjures up Jane Russell from a basket by playing a flute. Alas, she, too, rejects Harold, which means George walks off with both Lala and Jane. A lonesome Harold is left on the beach, demanding that the film shouldn't finish and asking the audience to stick around to see what's going to happen next.\n\n\nAmong the celebrities who made token \"gag\" appearances in this film are bandleader Bob Crosby (Bing's brother), Humphrey Bogart, by way of a clip from \"The African Queen\", Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, and Jane Russell, as her character from the 1952 film \"Son of Paleface\". The cameo by Martin and Lewis was part of a 'comedy trade' whereby they made an appearance in this movie while Hope and Crosby appeared in Martin and Lewis's \"Scared Stiff\" the following year. Martin and Lewis also made films for Paramount at the time.\n\n\"Road to Bali\" was the first \"Road to...\" picture since 1947's \"Road to Rio\", and was known during production as \"The Road to Hollywood\". It was the sixth film in the series, the next to last, as well as the final \"Road\" film in which Dorothy Lamour's role would be the female lead. Nine years later, \"The Road to Hong Kong\" instead featured Joan Collins, with a cameo by Lamour. Filming started on April 21, 1952 and continued until July of the same year.\n\n\"Road to Bali\" was a co-production of Bing Crosby Enterprises, Hope Enterprises and Paramount.\n\nThe giant squid that threatens Bob Hope in an underwater scene was previously seen attacking Ray Milland in the Paramount production \"Reap the Wild Wind\" (1942), directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The erupting volcano climax was taken directly from the Paramount production \"Aloma of the South Seas\" (1941), also starring Lamour.\n\nIn keeping with the film's initial setting of Melbourne, Australia, many of the jokes contain references to Argyle socks, Australian opera singer Dame Nellie Melba, Tasmanian-born Errol Flynn, and a dance routine featuring Scottish bagpipes.\n\nAs with the other Road movies, Bob Hope breaks the \"fourth wall\" several times to make side comments to the audience. For example, as the music for a song sung by Bing Crosby begins, Hope looks to the camera and says, \"He's gonna sing, folks. Now's the time to go out and get the popcorn.\"\n\nCrosby breaks the fourth wall after Hope \"notices\" the audience is paying attention when he's about to tell Crosby how he escaped from the giant squid. Hope and Crosby walk away from the camera and Hope tells his story in exaggerated pantomime (out of earshot). Crosby then walks back toward the audience and shrugs at the camera, indicating Hope's description was indecipherable.\n\nHope Enterprises owned one-third of the film and Bob Hope wrote about this in his book \"This Is on Me\". \"There are other pleasant things about owning part of a picture. In the \"Road to Bali\" there was a beach scene for which tons of beautiful white sand had been trucked in from Pebble Beach. I had just put in a one-hole golf course at my house on Moorpark Street in North Hollywood. I had four sand traps standing empty, with nothing in them in which my friends could leave their hoof prints. When I saw that sand a light switched on in my head.\n“We own two-thirds of this sand, don’t we?” I asked.\n“Sure,” Bing said. “Why?”\n“Well,” I replied, “I’d like some of it for my course at home.”\nWhen he said, “Why not?” I called the prop man and said, “Take ten truck-loads of this sand out to my house when we’re done with it.”\n“No dice,” he said. “This is Paramount’s sand.”\nBing and I had another talk with the boys in the front office. As a result, part of the \"Road to Bali\" is in my back yard.\n\nThe New York premiere of the film took place at the Astor Theatre on January 29, 1953.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" was very enthusiastic in his review of January 30, 1953. \"...it is apparent that this veteran and camera-scarred team is the neatest, smoothest combo of comics now working the fun side of the screen. Apart, they may be very funny or clever or quaint or what you will, according to where you are sitting and what sort of picture they’re in. But together, and in a “Road” picture, with the consequent freedom of style and reckless impulse that goes with it, they are pretty nigh nonpareil. At least, that’s the word of this reviewer who spent a small part of yesterday falling out of a seat at the Astor while desperately clutching his sides. The reason? Quite simply, “Road to Bali” is a whoopingly hilarious film, full of pure crazy situations and deliciously discourteous gags, all played with evident relish and split-second timing by the team.\"\n\n\"Variety\" was more cautious having seen a preview and their comments may have resulted in the removal of a couple of scenes. \"Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour are back again in another of Paramount’s highway sagas, this time in Technicolor, with nonsensical amusement it’s only destination. That end is reached eventually, but the road isn’t a smooth highway and the entertainment occasionally falters. Overall, however, it serves its intended purpose satisfactorily and the grossing prospects are okay...Hal Walker’s direction is geared to the free-wheeling spirit that dominates the script and does well by it, as do the three stars and the featured cast.\" An extended choreographed version of \"The Road to Bali\" song which was cut from the final print has surfaced in recent years and Paramount chief Adolph Zukor revealed in his autobiography that an expensive water ballet sequence was cut from the film too.\n\nThe music for all songs was written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke. Van Heusen's birth name was Edward Chester Babcock. For the final \"Road\" picture, \"The Road to Hong Kong\", Hope's character was called Chester Babcock. \n\nWhen Decca Records was recording the songs from the movie, they did not use Dorothy Lamour. Peggy Lee recorded the Lamour vocals.\n\n\nBing Crosby, Bob Hope and Peggy Lee recorded all of the songs for Decca Records and these were issued on a 10\" LP. Crosby's songs were also included in the Bing's Hollywood series.\n\n\"Road to Bali\" was parodied in 1953 in the animated short \"Alley to Bali\", with Woody Woodpecker and Buzz Buzzard in the Hope and Crosby roles. The cartoon was released by Universal Studios, which currently owns the first four \"Road to...\" films.\n\nThe film was copyrighted under registration LP2200 1 January 1953. That registration entry also shows \"in notice: 1952\", meaning that is the year in the copyright notice on the film. The copyright was renewed under RE105899 dated 1 September 1981. However, according to copyright law, when the \"in notice\" year is earlier than the calendar year of the official registration, the copyright term begins in the earlier year (1952 in this case). Therefore, for films registered for copyright in 1950 and later, the window for a valid renewal was the 28th calendar year of the original copyright term. For \"Road to Bali\", the 28th year was 1980, which means the film had already fallen into the public domain when the copyright was renewed in 1981.\n\nColumbia Pictures Television (in joint venture with LBS Communications through what was then Colex Enterprises) once had the television rights to this film in the 1980s, along with other Bob Hope movies from the 1940s and 1950s. This is evident in a home video release from the mid-1990s, where a CPT logo can be seen at the beginning and end of the film.\n\nBecause the film is in the public domain, there have been at least a dozen DVD releases from a variety of companies over the years. However, FremantleMedia now holds ancillary rights to this film (as the successor in interest to LBS Communications), and official video releases have been issued under license from Fremantle, with DVD and HD-DVD releases coming from BCI Eclipse. A Blu-Ray was released on July 5, 2017 by the Kino International (company).\n\n"}

Starring Brooks, Bill Pullman, John Candy and Rick Moranis, the film also features Daphne Zuniga, Dick Van Patten, and the voice of Joan Rivers. In addition to Brooks in a supporting role, the film also features Brooks regulars Dom DeLuise and Rudy De Luca in cameo appearances.\n\nThe film's setting and characters parody the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, as well as other sci-fi franchises including \"Star Trek\", \"Alien\" and the \"Planet of the Apes\" films. It was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on June 24, 1987, and was met with a mixed reception. It has since become a cult classic on video and one of Brooks's most popular films.\n\nPlanet Spaceball, led by the incompetent President Skroob, has squandered all of its fresh air. Skroob schemes to force King Roland of the neighboring planet Druidia to give them the code to the shield that protects Druidia, allowing them to steal all their air, by kidnapping his daughter Princess Vespa on the day of her pre-arranged wedding to the narcoleptic Prince Valium. Skroob sends the villainous Dark Helmet to complete this task with \"Spaceball One\", an impossibly huge ship helmed by Colonel Sandurz. Before they can arrive, Vespa abandons her wedding and flees the planet in her Mercedes spaceship with her droid of honor, Dot Matrix.\n\nRoland contacts mercenary Lone Starr and his \"mog\" (half-man, half-dog) sidekick Barf, offering a lucrative reward to retrieve Vespa before she is captured. Lone Starr readily accepts, as he is in major debt with the gangster Pizza the Hutt. In their Winnebago spaceship, the \"Eagle 5\", Lone Starr and Barf are able to reach Vespa before \"Spaceball One\", rescue both her and Dot, then escape. \"Spaceball One\" tries to follow, but Helmet orders the ship to \"ludicrous speed,\" causing it to overshoot the escapees by a large distance.\n\nOut of fuel, Lone Starr is forced to crash-land on the nearby \"desert moon of Vega\". The escapees travel on foot in blazing sun and pass out. They are found by the Dinks, a group of diminutive sparkly brown-clad aliens, and are taken to a cave occupied by a sage named Yogurt. Yogurt introduces Lone Starr to \"The Schwartz\", a metaphysical power similar to the Force. Yogurt also introduces the audience to the film's merchandising campaign. Starr and Vespa begin to flirt, but Vespa insists she can only be married to a prince.\n\nHelmet and Sandurz break the fourth wall by using a VHS copy of the film to discover Vespa's location, and Helmet orders \"Spaceball One\" to the moon. The Spaceballs capture Vespa and Dot, and return with them to planet Spaceball. Their captors threaten to reverse Vespa's nose job, forcing Roland to give the code to the shield that protects Druidia. Helmet and Sandurz take \"Spaceball One\" to Druidia, while Lone Starr and Barf rescue Vespa and Dot from the Spaceballs prison complex. When they arrive at Druidia, the \"Spaceball One\" ship transforms into \"Mega Maid\", a robotic maid with a vacuum cleaner. The vacuum is then turned on, sucking the air off the planet. When the vacuum bag is almost full, Lone Starr uses the Schwartz to reverse the vacuum, blowing the air back onto the planet.\n\nOnce the air is returned to the planet, Lone Starr and his allies enter the \"Mega Maid\" to attempt to destroy it. Lone Starr is forced to fight Helmet with lightsaber-like \"Schwartz rings\" near the ship's self-destruct button. Lone Starr defeats Helmet, causing him to involuntarily strike the button. Lone Starr and his friends escape the ship while Skroob, Helmet, and Sandurz fail to reach any escape pods in time, trapping them in the robot's head as the ship explodes. Subsequently, they land on a nearby planet, much to the chagrin of its \"Planet of the Apes\"-like population.\n\nWith Lone Starr's debt to Pizza nullified by the gangster's untimely death, he returns Vespa to Roland and leaves, taking only enough money to cover his expenses. After a lunch break at a diner, and a strange incident involving an alien and an astronaut similar to the events in \"Alien\", Lone Starr finds a final message from Yogurt informing him that he is a prince and thus eligible to marry Vespa. He reaches Druidia in time to stop her wedding to Valium, announces his royal lineage, then marries Vespa.\n\nJohn Hurt makes a cameo appearance credited as himself, parodying his character Gilbert Kane's death in the 1979 film \"Alien\". Various actors and comedians appear in unnamed roles, with Sal Viscuso, Michael Pniewski, Stephen Tobolowsky, Robert Prescott, Tom Dreesen, Rick Ducommun, Tommy Swerdlow and Tim Russ all appearing as soldiers of Dark Helmet. Additional unnamed appearances include Ronny Graham as the wedding minister, Dey Young as a waitress, Jack Riley as a newsman, Ken Olfson as the head usher, Bryan O'Byrne as an organist and Brenda Strong as a nurse. Ed Gale, Felix Silla, Tony Cox, Antonio Hoyos, Arturo Gil and John Kennedy Hayden appear as the Dinks.\n\nWhen Brooks developed \"Spaceballs\", he wanted his parody to be as close to the original as possible. Even though the Yogurt character (Mel Brooks) mentions merchandising in the film, Brooks' deal with George Lucas on parodying \"Star Wars\" was that no \"Spaceballs\" action figures be made. According to Brooks, \"[Lucas] said, 'Your [action figures] are going to look like mine.' I said OK.\"\n\nBrooks also had Lucas' company handle the post-production, saying, \"I was playing ball with the people who could have said no.\" Lucas later sent Brooks a note saying how much he loved \"Spaceballs\" and that he \"was afraid [he] would bust something from laughing\".\n\nPullman got the part of Lone Starr when Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft saw him in a play—he had never seen \"Star Wars\" prior to filming. Brooks had been unsuccessfully trying to sign on big-name actors such as Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks for the film. Pullman said, \"I think [Mel] was hurt that they didn't take him up on it ... but then it attract[ed] two of the big comics at that time: John Candy and Rick Moranis. Once that was secured, then he said, 'Heck, I'll get somebody nobody knows!' And I got a chance to do it.\"\n\nZuniga initially found Brooks' film parodies \"too crass and not too funny\", but after working with Brooks, she said, \"I have this image of Mel as totally wacko and out to lunch. And he is. But he's also really perceptive, real sensitive in ways that make actors respond.\"\n\nAn official soundtrack was released on Atlantic Records on audio CD and Compact Cassette, featuring many of the songs heard in the film, as well as three score cues by frequent Brooks collaborator John Morris.\n\nFor the \"19th Anniversary\", La-La Land Records released a \"limited edition\" CD, presenting the score in its entirety for the first time, with bonus tracks featuring alternate takes and tracks composed for, but not used in the film.\n\n\nThe film had an estimated $22.7 million budget, and ultimately grossed $38,119,483 during its run in the United States, taking in $6,613,837 on its opening weekend, finishing behind \"Dragnet\".\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 58% of critics gave positive reviews based on 38 reviews with an average rating of 6.3/10. At another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 46%, based on 14 reviews. Many critics agreed that, while it was funny, doing a \"Star Wars\" parody ten years after the original film had been released seemed pointless. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and remarked \"I enjoyed a lot of the movie, but I kept thinking I was at a revival…it should have been made several years ago, before our appetite for \"Star Wars\" satires had been completely exhausted.\"\n\n\"Spaceballs\" was first made available on VHS and LaserDisc in February 1988; they were re-released in the late 1990s. The VHS edition was issued twice; the latter edition was presented in widescreen. The laserdisc, meanwhile, also gained a commentary track with Brooks; this was transferred over to the DVD and Blu-ray releases. The film was first released on DVD on April 25, 2000. This version also contained \"the making of...\" documentary and a collectible \"making-of\" booklet. The film was then released in the \"Collectors Edition\" on May 3, 2005. This edition contained more extras including the documentary and the video conversation about the making of the film with Brooks and Thomas Meehan. On August 7, 2012, the \"25th Anniversary Edition\" was released on Blu-ray containing many of the same bonus features as the 2005 DVD release with the addition of a new featurette.\n\n\"Spaceballs\" was developed into an animated television show which debuted in September 2008 as \"\" on G4 (US) and Super Channel (Canada).\n\nMoranis claimed in a 2013 interview that he and Brooks had discussed a potential sequel, with Moranis pitching the title \"Spaceballs III: The Search for Spaceballs II\". However, he and Brooks were unable to structure a deal that would allow the project to move forward.\n\nIn February 2015, Brooks said that he would like to make a sequel to be released after the and hopes that Moranis would reprise his role. A sequel with the whole cast is not possible since Candy, Rivers, Van Patten and DeLuise have passed away. This proposed film, Brooks said, may be called .\n\n\"Spaceballs\" has made an impact on popular culture and been used as a referent and inspiration in other properties.\n\nTesla Motors has used Spaceballs' starship speeds (Light Speed, Ridiculous Speed, Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed) as inspiration for naming their acceleration modes. In homage to \"Spaceballs\", Tesla has \"Ludicrous Mode\" for acceleration beyond its Insane Mode, and \"Plaid Mode\", overtop Ludicrous.\n\nA 1/12-scale model of the Winnebago, \"Eagle 5\", will be auctioned on December 11, 2018. The model was created by film special effects designer, Grant McCune, who also created models for \"Star Wars\" and \"Star Trek\". The model makes an appearance early in the film with the introduction of Barf and Lone Starr.\n\n"}

They can be used for decoration or for functional purposes, depending on the situation. \n\nStickers can come in many different shapes and sizes and also vary widely in colour and design. They are often adhered to items such as lunchboxes, paper, lockers, notebooks, walls, cars, windows, and so on. Temporary name tags for example are frequently stickers.\n\nStickers are very widely used when an object requires with a word or idea. Brand stickers may be attached to products to label these products as coming from a certain company. They may also be used to describe characteristics of the products that would not be obvious from simple examination. A label dispenser is often used as a convenient way to separate the sticky label from its liner or backing tape.\n\nStickers placed on automobile bumpers, called \"bumper stickers\", are often used by individuals as a way of demonstrating support for political or ideological causes. Identification of vehicle registration and last service details are two examples of stickers on the inside of most car windscreens. The term \"window sticker\" is generally used for vinyl labels which are stuck to the inside of a vehicle's window, as opposed to water-resistant stickers that are stuck to the outside of a vehicle but can be affixed to anything.\n\nStickers are also used for embellishing scrapbooking pages. Kinds of stickers sold for this purpose include acrylic, 3D, cardstock, epoxy, fabric, flocked, sparkly, paper, puffy, and vellum. While in the earlier days of scrapbooking stickers were sold mostly on 2\"x6\" sheets, now 6\"x12\" and even 12\"x12\" size sheets are very common.\n\nStickers applied to guitars are called guitar decals. Post-it notes are removable stickers having glue on only part of the back, and are usually sold blank. \n\nThey are frequently distributed as part of promotional, and political campaigns; for example, in many voting districts in the U.S., stickers indicating an individual has voted are given to each voter as they leave the polling place, largely as a reminder to others to vote. Observers may clap hands, honk a horn or otherwise applaud a good sticker.\n\nForming a partnership with FIFA in 1970, Panini first produced a World Cup sticker album for the 1970 World Cup. Initiating a craze for collecting and trading stickers, since then, collecting and trading stickers has become part of the World Cup experience, especially for the younger generation. UK newspaper \"The Guardian\" states, “the tradition of swapping duplicate [World Cup] stickers was a playground fixture during the 1970s and 1980s.”\n\nSome people put stickers (magnetic and permanent) on their cars to advertise their business, or to show support for sports teams or political views.\n\nStickers placed on tires, usually called tire lettering, can be temporary or permanent. These spell out names or have graphics on them, to enhance the look of the car.\n\n"}

{"id": "327195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=327195", "title": "Tripitaka Koreana", "text": "Tripitaka Koreana\n\nThe Tripiṭaka Koreana (lit. \"Goryeo Tripiṭaka\") or Palman Daejanggyeong (\"Eighty-Thousand \"Tripiṭaka\"\") is a Korean collection of the \"Tripiṭaka\" (Buddhist scriptures, and the Sanskrit word for \"three baskets\"), carved onto 81,258 wooden printing blocks in the 13th century. It is the world's most comprehensive and oldest intact version of Buddhist canon in Hanja script, with no known errors or errata in the 52,330,152 characters which are organized in over 1496 titles and 6568 volumes. Each wood block measures 24 centimeters in height and 70 centimeters in length. The thickness of the blocks ranges from 2.6 to 4 centimeters and each weighs about three to four kilograms. The woodblocks are almost as tall as Mount Baekdu at 2.74 km when stacked, measure 60 km long when lined up, and weigh 280 tons in total. The woodblocks are in pristine condition without warping or deformation despite being created more than 750 years ago. The Tripiṭaka Koreana is stored in Haeinsa, a Buddhist temple in South Gyeongsang Province, in South Korea.\n\nThere is a movement by scholars to change the English name of the Tripiṭaka Koreana. Professor Robert Buswell Jr., a leading scholar of Korean Buddhism, called for the renaming of the Tripiṭaka Koreana to the Korean Buddhist Canon, indicating that the current nomenclature is misleading because the Tripiṭaka Koreana is much greater in scale than the actual Tripiṭaka, and includes much additional content such as travelogues, Sanskrit and Chinese dictionaries, and biographies of monks and nuns.\n\nThe Tripiṭaka Koreana was designated a National Treasure of South Korea in 1962, and inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2007.\n\nThe name Goryeo \"Tripiṭaka\" comes from \"Goryeo\", the name of Korea from the 10th to the 14th centuries.\n\nWork on the first Tripiṭaka Koreana began in 1011 during the Goryeo–Khitan War and was completed in 1087. The act of carving the woodblocks was considered to be a way of bringing about a change in fortune by invoking the Buddha's help. The first Tripiṭaka Koreana was based primarily on the Northern Song Tripiṭaka completed in the 10th century, but other scriptures published until then, such as the Khitan Tripiṭaka, were also consulted in order to identify items in need of revision and adjustment. The first Tripiṭaka Koreana contained around 6,000 volumes.\n\nThe original set of woodblocks was destroyed by fire during the Mongol invasions of Korea in 1232, when Goryeo's capital was moved to Ganghwa Island during nearly three decades of Mongol incursions, although scattered parts of its prints still remain. To once again implore divine assistance with combating the Mongol threat, King Gojong thereafter ordered the revision and re-creation of the Tripiṭaka; the carving began in 1237 and was completed in 12 years, with support from Choe U and his son Choe Hang, and involving monks from both the Seon and Gyo schools. This second version is usually what is meant by the Tripiṭaka Koreana. In 1398, it was moved to Haeinsa, where it has remained housed in four buildings.\n\nThe production of the Tripiṭaka Koreana was an enormous national commitment of money and manpower, according to Robert Buswell Jr., perhaps comparable to the US missions to the Moon in the 1960s. Thousands of scholars and craftsmen were employed in this massive project.\n\nThe Tripiṭaka Koreana is the 32nd National Treasure of South Korea, and Haeinsa, the depository for the Tripiṭaka Koreana, has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The UNESCO committee describes the Tripiṭaka Koreana as \"one of the most important and most complete corpus of Buddhist doctrinal texts in the world\". Not only is the work invaluable, it is also aesthetically valuable and shows a high quality of workmanship.\n\nHaeinsa, the temple in which the Tripiṭaka Koreana is stored, is notable for its scientific design to ensure the optimum condition to best preserve the woodblocks, which have remained in pristine condition for more than 750 years.\n\nThe historical value of the Tripiṭaka Koreana comes from the fact that it is the most complete and accurate extant collection of Buddhist treatises, laws, and scriptures. The compilers of the Korean version incorporated older Northern Song Chinese, Khitan, and Goryeo versions, and added content written by respected Korean monks. Scholars can get an idea of the older Chinese and Khitan versions of the Tripiṭaka from the Korean version today. The quality of the wood blocks are attributed to the National Preceptor Sugi, the Buddhist monk in charge of the project, who carefully checked the Korean version for errors. Upon completing the Tripiṭaka Koreana, Sugi published 30 volumes of \"Additional Records\" which recorded errors, redundancies, and omissions he found during his comparisons of the different versions of the Tripiṭaka. Because of the accuracy of the Tripiṭaka Koreana, the Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese versions of the Tripiṭaka are based on the Korean version.\n\nThe Tripiṭaka Koreana was one of the most coveted items among Japanese Buddhists in the Edo period. Japan never managed to create a woodblock Tripiṭaka, and made constant requests and attempts to acquire the Tripiṭaka Koreana from Korea since 1388. 45 complete printings of the Tripiṭaka Koreana were gifted to Japan since the Muromachi period. The Tripiṭaka Koreana was used as the basis for the modern Japanese Taishō Tripiṭaka.\nEach block was made of birch wood from the southern islands of Korea and treated to prevent the decay of the wood. The blocks were soaked in sea water for three years, then cut and then boiled in salt water. Next, the blocks were placed in the shade and exposed to the wind for three years, at which point they were finally ready to be carved. After each block was carved, it was covered in a poisonous lacquer to keep insects away and then framed with metal to prevent warping.\n\nEvery block was inscribed with 23 lines of text with 14 characters per line. Therefore, each block, counting both sides, contained a total of 644 characters. The consistency of the style, and some sources, suggests that a single man carved the entire collection but it is now believed that a team of 30 men carved the Tripiṭaka.\n\nThe modern edition has 1514 texts in 47 volumes.\n\n\n"}

In addition to those mentioned, WikiPilipinas styles itself as a mash-up of several entities; a \"Who's Who\" of prominent Filipinos, a directory of institutions and companies, an almanac of the Philippines and a community portal for the different ethnic groups in the Philippines. As an online resource using the wiki model, it bills itself as a collaborative effort-content provider. The most major goal that the wiki has stated is \"to build the largest Philippine knowledge database\". Like Wikipedia, the contents of WikiPilipinas are open to editing by anyone with access to the Internet. However, editors must register before they are allowed to edit.\n\nWikiPilipinas was particularly launched by the Vibal Foundation, a nonprofit organization which previously created Filipiniana.net, and WikiPilipinas.org (a reference guide on the Philippines). Conjunctively, the Vibal Foundation (per Gaspar Vibal and his mother) made a historical move in Philippine education, when it also launched on June 12, 2008, the 110th Philippine Declaration of Independence day, e-turo.org, as conduit of these 3 landmark education tools. Tin Mandigma, editor-in-chief of E-turo.org explained that it is an e-learning portal which \"seeks to provide free and quality learning materials online to teachers and students; it gives teachers access to lesson plans and modules based on textbook materials published by Vibal Publishing House, Inc. amid plans to offer Department of Education-approved content from various learning institutions as supplementary teaching materials. One of the most common complaints of teachers is that while the Internet has so much information, most of it cannot be adapted to the local classroom. With this project, we hope to help teachers sort through the clutter and give them quality information that would be useful for their students.\"\n\nAlthough it is modeled after Wikipedia, WikiPilipinas differs from it in distinct ways. Founder Gaspar Vibal describes \"improvements\" including a directory of web portals based on those of Yahoo!, Inc., and community portals for Filipino ethnic groups. WikiPilipinas guidelines explicitly encourage, \"\"balanced presentation, but not a neutral point of view.\", state that WikiPilipinas, \"does not believe that any view can ever be neutral\" and that fair discussion of an issue is expected. One of the key pillars of Wikipedia is that articles be written from a neutral point of view, a major difference in encyclopedia models. WikiPilipinas supports the concept of original research, something Wikipedia forbids. WikiPilipinas encourages users to, \"present their own research and findings on the site\"\" and expects adequate references from editors for factual information. In addition, the site does not have the concept that is another cornerstone of Wikipedia. Articles about practically anything are allowed on the site. Also, WikiPilipinas' conceptualization is far removed from that of an academic encyclopedia. The site's policy and guideline page states, \"WikiPilipinas is not an academic encyclopedia.\" Unlike Wikipedia with its strict conflict of interest , WikiPilipinas has no rule preventing one from writing about oneself or one's family.\n\nThe contents of WikiPilipinas were originally from a selection of around 15,000 Philippine-related articles of Wikipedia. The addition of original articles began soon after, created by WikiPilipinas volunteers and its editorial team. All text in WikiPilipinas was originally licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), but on March 26, 2011, it migrated to the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.\n\nWikiPilipinas was originally conceived as Wikipiniana, an open content management system for volunteer members of the Philippine online resource Filipiniana.net. The site initially used the Plone content management system the production of articles was deemed too slow under the system. In September 2006, plans to shift the system to use the wiki-model were conceived (after the founding of Filipiniana.net) by its New York-based founder Gaspar Vibal and webmaster Richard Grimaldo. Octogenarian book publisher Esther A. Vibal, founder of Vibal Publishing House, Inc. (VPHI), and mother of Gaspar Vibal learned about online publishing and knowledge sharing. She introduced the concepts through Gaspar's Filipiniana.net and WikiPilipinas.org, the world’s biggest Philippine encyclopedia available on the Web.\n\nThe actual conceptualization of WikiPilipinas (then-Wikipiniana) occurred in February 2007. In planning, MediaWiki was officially selected to be the site's platform and it was decided that the site were to be modeled after the Wikipedia. Instead of a complete of Wikipedia however, Wikipiniana was to be a \"hipper\" and \"freer\" version, including almanac lists and directories. The WikiPilipinas team, headed by Grimaldo as webmaster and Alfred Ursua as its managing editor, drew up an initial masterlist of priority contents for Project Wikipiniana.\n\nThe project officially began on March 15, 2007. It was first made available online three months after on June 12 to coincide with the country's official Independence Day. A month after going live, the official name of the service was changed from Wikipiniana to WikiPilipinas on July 7. WikiPhilippines was the term decided upon for the section of the site with articles in English and WikiFilipinas for the section in Spanish. A press-oriented sneak preview of the site was hosted for the local media on August 22 of the same year. The event was attended by major Philippine media outlets such as GMA-7 and RPN-9, print media like the Manila Bulletin, the Philippine Daily Inquirer, and the Manila Times and dozens of Philippine bloggers. In a press release on August 23, the site's publicists claimed to be \"the fastest online startup in Philippine history\" due to the site receiving 100,000 visitors during the slew of accesses that occurred after the site was covered by the media the previous day.\n\nWikiPilipinas had its official launch during the 28th Manila International Book Fair in late August 2007.\n\nThe project itself is owned by the Vibal Foundation, which bills itself as the \"corporate social arm\" of Vibal Publishing House. It is a sister-project to Filipiniana.net, a Philippine-oriented research portal.\n\nAs a Philippine company, the site's physical servers are situated in Metro Manila in the Philippines. The site was originally hosted on the servers of its sister project, Filipiniana.net. However, a surge of viewers following intense media coverage on August 21, 2007 prompted the site's owners to turn to VConnect Inc. to upgrade the site's hardware. WikiPilipinas is now hosted on an IBM System x 3850 with dual 3 gigahertz Intel Xeon CPUs, 16 gigabytes of RAM and 1.4 terabytes of combined hard drive space. The site's internet connection is provided by IP Converge with a total bandwidth allocation of 10 Mbit/s.\n\nWikiPilipinas has been the subject of several articles by major broadsheet newspapers in the Philippines. The service itself has been covered by GMA Network news in segments on two of the station's daily news programs.\n\nMany of its observers on the blogging community and , the Philippine Wikipedia , have observed that it is \"trying to be everything all at once: magazine, putative encyclopedia, pluralistic community forum, soapbox-for-a-day, rumor rag, fight club. It is a pastische of different entities, each of which has been successful on its own, but it remains to be seen whether they will be as successful when smashed together. It is less an organic fusion as it is an unnatural pile-up of knowledge-sharing methodologies taken from Euro-America. In many ways, it is symptomatic and representative of the Philippine condition.\"\n\nUpon learning of its inception, a few Filipino bloggers questioned the usefulness of WikiPilipinas as a of Wikipedia. In a post entitled \"Is There Any Point to Wikipiniana?\", a Filipino blogger weighed the pros and cons of having an encyclopedia administered to entirely by Filipinos. Filipino blogger and Wikipedian Eugene Alvin Villar questioned the usefulness and purpose of WikiPilipinas in a blog post on July 19, 2007. He argued that the \"hip and free encyclopedia\"'s policy on articles not needing to adhere to a (as Wikipedia does) was not conducive to an unbiased encyclopedia. With WikiPilipinas being marketed as an encyclopedia \"by Filipinos, for Filipinos,\" Villar pointed out the great possibility of bias in the encyclopedia's articles. Aside from the possibility of bias, he also mentioned that the articles of WikiPilipinas were less likely to rank higher than those of the English Wikipedia in web searches, making effort spent in updating WikiPilipinas articles better spent working on their equivalent Wikipedia articles. He later reiterated some of these concerns in an interview with the Manila Bulletin in September. In the interview, he criticized WikiPilipinas for prioritizing publicity over streamlining the site's policies and guidelines. Notable Filipino blogger Abraham Olandres personally mentioned Villar's criticism of WikiPilipinas. In his post, Olandres agreed that the Filipino-based service would be useless and redundant unless it \"came up with its own set of content\". In a later entry, Olandres pointed out that WikiPilipinas' lack of a notability guideline could possibly slant it towards a Filipino-centric sense of pseudo-notability.\n\nKristine Mandigma, the president of the Philippine literacy advocacy group Read-or-Die Foundation, also made a commentary on WikiPilipinas after attending the service's August 22 official press launch. She described WikiPilipinas as \"the online version of an \"omnium gatherum\"… a motley and captivating assortment of ideas, facts and factoids, emotions, dissertations, and agonized biographies.\"\n\nThe site's credibility was questioned in line with a possible connection to Vibal Publishing House, a local publishing service that was implicated in a controversial textbook scandal. Both the publishing company and WikiPilipinas are owned by the same person, Gaspar Vibal. In an interview with the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\", Vibal asserted that the wiki project and the publishing house were independent of each other.\n"}
{"id": "5975937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5975937", "title": "William Sturgis Bigelow", "text": "William Sturgis Bigelow\n\nWilliam Sturgis Bigelow (1850–1926), son of Henry Jacob Bigelow, was a prominent American collector of Japanese art. He was one of the first Americans to live in Japan , and, through his donations to Boston area museums, helped to form the standards by which Japanese art and culture were appreciated in the west. \n\nBigelow received his degree in medicine from Harvard University in 1874, and continued his medical studies in Europe for five years, under Louis Pasteur. His primary interest was bacteriology, but when his father, a surgeon, pressured him to follow in that profession, Bigelow abandoned a medical career.\n\nBigelow began collecting Japanese art as a student in Paris. In 1882, inspired by lectures on Japan delivered by Edward Sylvester Morse, Bigelow traveled to Japan. There he subsidized the scholarly work of Morse and another young Harvard graduate Ernest Fenollosa, both of whom were teaching at Japanese universities. Bigelow remained in Japan for seven years, traveling with Morse and Fenollosa to parts of the country off limits to other foreigners. With the special authorizations of the Japanese government, Bigelow, Fellonosa and Morse were able to explore parts of Japan closed to outside viewers for centuries. The group visited the Shōsō-in (Treasure House) of Tōdai-ji, viewing hidden treasures of Emperor Shōmu, and were granted a few shards of pottery, the only items belonging to the Shōsō-in known to currently reside outside of it. Among the many other items he obtained during his time in Japan were a set of gilt bronze statues from Hōryū-ji, of the historical Buddha and attendants, known as the Shaka Trinity statues, and a mandala from the Hokke-do (Lotus Sutra Hall) of Tōdai-ji, one of the oldest Japanese paintings to ever leave Japan. Morse collected ancient ceramics, Bigelow collected armor, and Fenollosa, often with Bigelow's financial help, collected paintings. \nReturning to the United States, Bigelow donated approximately 75,000 objects of Japanese art to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. His collections, along with those of Morse and Fenollosa (the latter paid for by Charles Goddard Weld) Okakura, and a handful of others, made the newly founded Department of the Art of Asia at the Museum of Fine Arts the largest collection of Japanese art anywhere outside Japan; a distinction it still holds today. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1911.. \n\nBigelow's enthusiasm for the elite male camaraderie he enjoyed in Japan is reflected in the nature of these collections. Where Parisian collections emphasized Japanese domestic objects, including women's kimonos and allied textiles, modern decorated ceramics, and prints associated with the pleasure quarters famed for their bawdy entertainments and stylized forms of prostitution, the Boston collectors focused on the elite all-male aspects of Japanese society: the tea ceremony, the samurai, and elite communities of Buddhist monks.\n\nWith Fenollosa, Bigelow converted to Tendai Buddhism, about which he taught and lectured back in Boston. There he used Episcopalian terms, such as bishop, to describe senior monks, and dismissed simpler forms of Buddhism, such as Zen and Shin, referring to the latter as a \"very big and popular and easy-going sect...the Salvation Army of Buddhism\" \n\nIn traveling through Japan and forming their collections, Bigelow and his Boston colleagues were helped by one of Fenollosa's students, Okakura Kakuzō. Inspired by these Westerners' admiration for the traditions of the Japanese aristocracy, Okakura, with Bigelow's financial backing, founded an art school, the \"Nihon Bijutsuin\" (Japan Fine Arts Academy), to preserve and promote traditional forms of Japanese art.\n\nWhen in 1898 Okakura was ousted by faculty and students at the school who objected to his rigid focus on traditional art, Bigelow hired him to oversee the Japanese art collections at the Museum of Fine Arts. Okakura sustained his patron's emphasis on transforming the Western image of a tea house filled with women and domestic utensils to that of a temple filled with religious scroll paintings and sculptures. When in 1909 the museum moved to a new building, a gallery and courtyard garden designed to mimic a temple and its forecourt was built to display Japanese sculpture. This very popular space became a model for other American museums displaying East Asian art. \nBigelow's publicity for his vision of Japan extended to his teachings on Buddhism. He delivered the annual Ingersoll Lecture on the Immortality of Man at Harvard in 1908, which was published as book \"Buddhism and Immortality\" (1908). There Bigelow used the scientific language of nature selection to explain spiritual evolution as when an individual emerges from \"unconditioned consciousness\" and \"moves up the scale of evolution guided by natural selection.\" Next the individual moves to a level of celestial experience and finally is able to \"return to the unconditioned consciousness from which all things emerge. In his view, familial ties were created by reincarnaton and what he called \"thought transference.\" Bigelow's contemporaries compared his relationship o the Japanese monk who instructed him in Buddhism as that of \"a filial child\" to a \"benevolent father.\" Historian T.J. Jackson Lears has analyzed Bigelow's embrace of Buddhims as \"leaving a stern father for a benign Ajari [teacher].\" Bigelow accepted both material and spiritual evolution and believed Buddhism and science were compatible.\n\nBiglow's preference for the company of men was manifest nowhere more clearly than on his island retreat of Tuckernuck, off Nantucket. There he invited other men to enjoy the pleasures of dining and swimming in a world without women. Bigelow was heart-broken when George Cabot Lodge, the young poet he had chosen as his spiritual son to inherit his island estate, died there at the age of thirty-five. Lodge's 1906 poem \"Tuckanuck\" celebrates the island as a place \"to dream an Eastern dream, starred by the cry/ of sea-birds...\" A more exuberant letter from Lodge to Bigelow anticipating a trip to the island reads \"kind Sir! Surf Sir! And sun, Sir! And Nakedness! -Oh Lord! How I want to get my clothes off-alone in natural solitudes.\"\n\nThe line between homosexuality and homoeroticism blurs in Bigelow's biography; he has been described as \"at once an epicure and a mystic, who professed an ascetic religion and wore beautiful Charvet haberdashery.\" He was also reported to have proposed marriage in 1899 to the Croatian soprano Milka Ternina, who was at the time singing at the Metropolitan Opera. He gave her a 38-carat diamond named “Cleveland”, while a week later he presented her a letter with his marriage proposal. She rejected the proposal but from then on their relationship became more intimate. During their relationship, he gave her a number of Japanese objects which she donated in 1930 to the Etnografski Muzej in Zagreb.\n\nBigelow was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1911. Upon his death, in accordance with his final requests, Bigelow's remains were cremated; half the ashes were buried at Mii-dera, just outside Kyoto, along with those of Fenollosa, and half were interred in the Sturgis family plot at Mount Auburn Cemetery.\n\n\n"}
