Bakhrushin state Central Theatre Museum (abbreviated as SCTM. A. A. Bakhrushin, the Bakhrushin Museum, the former Literary-Theatrical Museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences , also known as ГЦТМ им. А.А.Бахрушина) is a theatre special museum in Moscow based in 1894 famous Russian merchant, and philanthropist Alexey Bakhrushin.\n\nGreat Soviet Encyclopedia characterizes it as the largest theatre museum in the world.\n\nIn search of exhibits, Alexey Alexandrovich Bakhrushin has repeatedly made long trips to Russia, from which he brought not only theater rarities, but also works of folk art, furniture, old Russian costumes.\n\nWhile visiting abroad, Alexey Alexandrovich certainly went around antique shops. In the early XX century it was three times made a special trip to replenish the sections on the history of Western theatre. From abroad, he brought personal belongings of the French actress Mars, a collection of masks of the Italian Comedy theater, many rare musical instruments.\n\nOne of the main sources of replenishment of the Museum's collection were gifts. \"Liegestuhle brethren,\" according to the antiquary M. M. Savostina, so liking the idea about the creation of the Bakhrushin theatre Museum, many \"bezdarno and free of duty,\" sent him a present of rare photos, autographs, memorabilia. The inflow of gifts contributed to and gained considerable popularity in theatrical circles of Moscow \"Cold Saturday.\" On the \"light\" was going to Bahrushina known actors and Directors: it was visited by Alexander Yuzhin, Aleksandr Pavlovich Lensky, Maria Yermolova, Feodor Chaliapin, Leonid Sobinov, Konstantin Stanislavski, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko. According to the tradition, they were not here empty-handed. Thus, the famous actress of the Maly theater Glikeriya Fedotova gave Bakhrushin all her relics and gifts received during the years of stage life.\n\nThe day of Foundation of the Museum is considered 29.10.1894 year, when Bakhrushin first presented his collection for public inspection. In 1913, on November 25, the Museum was transferred to Academy of sciences with the condition of leaving it in Moscow, and in 1917 the Museum was included in the network of state institutions, and Alexei Bakhrushin in 1918 at the suggestion of Vladimir Lenin, was appointed the life Director of the Museum.\n\nUntil 1917, the Museum was visited by about 300-400 people a year, then much more. By 1917, the Museum had about 12 thousand exhibits. The Museum funds were actively replenished in Soviet times, in 1949, they numbered 314 thousand units of storage, and in the 1990s-more than one million exhibits. Today the Museum's collection includes more than one and a half million exhibits.\n\nIn 2014 The state theatre Museum named after him. A. A.

{"id": "99794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99794", "title": "Blueprint", "text": "Blueprint\n\nA blueprint is a reproduction of a technical drawing, an architectural plan, or an engineering design, using a contact print process on light-sensitive sheets. Introduced by Sir John Herschel in 1842, the process allowed rapid, and accurate, production of an unlimited number of copies. It was widely used for over a century for the reproduction of specification drawings used in construction and industry. The blueprint process was characterized by white lines on a blue background, a negative of the original. The process was not able to reproduce color or shades of grey. \n\nThe term \"blueprint\" is also used less formally to refer to any floor plan (and even less formally, any type of plan).\n\nThe blueprint process is based on a photosensitive ferric compound. The best known is a process using ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide. The paper is impregnated with a solution of ammonium ferric citrate and dried. When the paper is illuminated, a photoreaction turns the trivalent ferric iron into divalent ferrous iron. The image is then developed using a solution of potassium ferricyanide forming insoluble ferroferricyanide (Prussian blue or Turnbell's blue) with the divalent iron. Excess ammonium ferric citrate and potassium ferricyanide are then washed away. The process is also known as cyanotype.\n\nThis is a simple process for the reproduction of any light transmitting document. Engineers and architects drew their designs on cartridge paper; these were then traced on to tracing paper using India ink for reproduction whenever needed. The tracing paper drawing is placed on top of the sensitized paper, and both are clamped under glass, in a daylight exposure frame, which is similar to a picture frame. The frame is put out into daylight, requiring a minute or two under a bright sun, or about ten minutes under an overcast sky to complete the exposure. Where ultra-violet light is transmitted through the tracing paper, the light sensitive coating converts to a stable blue or black dye. Where the India ink blocks the ultra-violet light the coating does not convert and remains soluble. The image can be seen forming. When a strong image is seen the frame is brought indoors to stop the process. The unconverted coating is washed away, and the paper is then dried. The result is a copy of the original image with the clear background area rendered dark blue and the image reproduced as a white line. \n\nThis process has several features:\nIntroduction of the blueprint process eliminated the expense of photolithographic reproduction or of hand-tracing of original drawings. By the later 1890s in American architectural offices, a blueprint was one-tenth the cost of a hand-traced reproduction. The blueprint process is still used for special artistic and photographic effects, on paper and fabrics.\n\nTraditional blueprints became obsolete when less expensive printing methods and digital displays became available. \n\nIn the early 1940s, cyanotype blueprint began to be supplanted by diazo prints, also known as whiteprints, which have blue lines on a white background; thus these drawings are also called \"blue-lines\" or bluelines. Other comparable dye-based prints were known as blacklines. Diazo prints remained in use until they were replaced by xerographic print processes.\n\nXerography is standard copy machine technology using toner on bond paper. When large size xerography machines became available, 1975, they replaced the older printing methods. As computer-aided design techniques came into use, the designs were printed directly using a computer printer or plotter. \n\nIn most computer-aided design of parts to be machined, paper is avoided altogether, and the finished design is an image on the computer display. The computer-aided design program generates a computer numerical control sequence from the approved design. The sequence is a computer file which will control the operation of the machine tools used to make the part. \nIn the case of construction plans, such as road work or erecting a building, the supervising workers will view the \"blueprints\" directly on displays, rather than use printed paper sheets. These displays include mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets. Software allows users to view and annotate electronic drawing files.\n\nVarious base materials have been used for blueprints. Paper was a common choice; for more durable prints linen was sometimes used, but with time, the linen prints would shrink slightly. To combat this problem, printing on imitation vellum and, later, polyester film (Mylar) was implemented.\n\nThe process is now obsolete. It was first largely displaced by the diazo whiteprint process, and later by large-format xerographic photocopiers. Now paper copies, made by any method, are rarely used, instead digital copies are used.\n\nThe traditional term \"blueprint\" continues to be used informally to refer to various types of image. Practicing engineers, architects, and drafters just call them \"drawings\" or \"prints\".\n\nMany of the original paper blueprints are archived since they are still in use. In many situations their conversion to digital form is prohibitively expensive. Most buildings and roads constructed before c. 1990 will only have paper blueprints, not digital. These originals have significant importance to the repair and alteration of constructions still in use, e.g. bridges, buildings, sewer systems, roads, railroads, etc.\n\n"}

The name reflects the usual practice of including that information in the corresponding publication—in the case of books, on the copyright page, where it can be useful for cataloguers when they are adding such items to their collections. The national libraries' CIP staffs restrict the range of publications that CIP will be prepared for, for instance requiring access to assistance from the publisher's staff.\n\nA frequent problem with CIP occurs when publishers change bibliographic details, such as the wording of a title, after receiving the CIP data. The CIP data as published in the item will be incorrect and useless to subsequent cataloguing agencies without manual amendment; if a pre-publication record has been entered onto a database, it can be difficult to locate and edit to match the details on the item itself.\n\nEach national library maintains a database of the entries it writes.\n\n"}

It houses the art collection of the Courtauld Institute of Art, a self-governing college of the University of London specialising in the study of the history of art. \n\nThe Courtauld collection was formed largely through donations and bequests and includes paintings, drawings, sculptures and other works from medieval to modern times; it is particularly known for its French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. \n\nIn total, the collection contains some 530 paintings and over 26,000 drawings and prints. The Head of the Courtauld Gallery is Ernst Vegelin.\n\nThe Courtauld Institute was founded in 1932 through the philanthropic efforts of the industrialist and art collector Samuel Courtauld, the diplomat and collector Lord Lee of Fareham, and the art historian Sir Robert Witt.\n\nThe art collection at the Courtauld was begun by Samuel Courtauld, who in the same year presented an extensive collection of paintings, mainly French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works. He made further gifts later in the 1930s and a bequest in 1948. \n\nHis collection included Manet's \"A Bar at the Folies-Bergère\" and a version of the \"Déjeuner sur l'Herbe\", Renoir's \"La Loge\", landscapes by Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro, a ballet scene by Edgar Degas, and a group of eight major works by Cézanne. Other paintings include Vincent van Gogh's \"Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear\" and \"Peach Blossoms in the Crau\", Gauguin's \"Nevermore\" and \"Te Rerioa\", and important works by Seurat, Henri \"le Douanier\" Rousseau, Toulouse-Lautrec and Modigliani.\n\nFurther bequests were added after the Second World War, most notably the collection of Old Master paintings assembled by Lord Lee, a founder of the Institute. This included Cranach's \"Adam and Eve\" and a sketch in oils by Peter Paul Rubens for what is arguably his masterpiece, the \"Deposition\" altarpiece in Antwerp Cathedral.\n\nSir Robert Witt, also a founder of the Courtauld Institute, was an outstanding benefactor and bequeathed his important collection of Old Master and British drawings in 1952. His bequest included 20,000 prints and more than 3000 drawings. His son, Sir John Witt, later gave more English watercolours and drawings to the Gallery.\n\nIn 1958 Pamela Diamand, the daughter of Roger Fry (1866–1934), the eminent art critic and founder of the Omega Workshops, donated his collection of 20th-century art including works by Bloomsbury Group artists Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant.\n\nIn 1966 Mark Gambier-Parry, son of Major Ernest Gambier-Parry, bequeathed the diverse collection of art formed by his grandfather, Thomas Gambier Parry, which ranged from Early Italian Renaissance painting to majolica, medieval enamel and ivory carvings, and other types of art (see section below).\n\nDr William Wycliffe Spooner (1882–1967) and his wife Mercie added to the Gallery's collection of English watercolours in 1967 with a bequest of works by John Constable, John Sell Cotman, Alexander and John Robert Cozens, Thomas Gainsborough, Thomas Girtin, Samuel Palmer, Thomas Rowlandson, Paul Sandby, Francis Towne, J. M. W. Turner, Peter De Wint and others.\n\nIn 1974 a group of thirteen watercolours by Turner was presented in memory of Sir Stephen Courtauld, famous for restoring Eltham Palace, and the brother of Samuel Courtauld, one of the founders of the Institute.\n\nIn 1978 the Courtauld received the Princes Gate Collection of Old Master paintings and drawings formed by Count Antoine Seilern. The collection rivals the Samuel Courtauld Collection in importance. It includes paintings by Bernardo Daddi, Robert Campin, Bruegel, Quentin Matsys, Van Dyck and Tiepolo, but is strongest in the works of Rubens. The bequest also included a group of 19th- and 20th‑century works by Pissarro, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Oskar Kokoschka.\n\nMore recently the Lillian Browse and Alastair Hunter collections have given the Courtauld more late 19th- and 20th‑century paintings, drawings and sculptures.\n\nA collection of more than 50 British watercolours, including eight by Turner, was left to the Gallery by Dorothy Scharf in 2004.\n\nThe gallery closed on 3rd September 2018 for at least two years during a major redevelopment costing £50M.\n\nThe Courtauld Gallery is open to the public.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1989 the Courtauld collection was housed in part of the premises of the Warburg Institute in Woburn Square; it was thus separated from the Courtauld Institute, which was in Home House, Portman Square. \n\nSince 1989 it has been housed, together with the Courtauld Institute, in the North or Strand block of Somerset House, in the rooms designed and purpose-built by Sir William Chambers for the learned societies, namely the Royal Academy (of which Chambers was the first Treasurer), the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries.\n\nThe Royal Academy occupied them from their completion in 1780 until it moved to the new National Gallery building in Trafalgar Square in 1837. Inscribed over the entrance to the Great Room, in which the annual Royal Academy summer exhibition was held, is the formidable inscription (\"Let no stranger to the Muses enter\" in Ancient Greek). \n\n\"Dutch School\"\n\n\"Early Netherlandish\"\n\n\"English School\"\n\n\"Flemish School\"\n\n\"French School\"\n\n\"German School\"\n\n\"Italian School\"\n\n\"Spanish School\"\n\nThomas Gambier Parry (1816–1888) was a keen and versatile collector for most of his adult life. Many of his purchases were made on trips to the continent, especially Italy, but he also bought from dealers and auctions in England, and sometimes sold items. \n\nHis most important collections were of late medieval and Early Renaissance paintings, small sculpted reliefs, ivories, and maiolica, but he also had a significant early collection of Islamic metalwork, and a variety of other types of objects, for example Hispano-Moresque ware, glass and three small post-Byzantine wooden crosses from Mount Athos elaborately carved with miniature scenes. \n\nThe Courtauld Gallery website shows images and descriptions of 324 objects from the 1966 bequest, which included the bulk of the collection.\n\nGambier Parry began by collecting mostly 16th- and 17th-century works, but his focus gradually moved to 14th- and 15th-century works, still relatively little collected, although Prince Albert was among British collectors of \"Italian Primitives\", as Trecento paintings were then known. Among his most important paintings were a \"Coronation of the Virgin\" by Lorenzo Monaco, one of the larger works in the collection, three predella panels with roundels of Christ and saints by Fra Angelico, and a small but important diptych of the Annunciation by Pesellino. There are two further predella panels by Lorenzo Monaco, and many other small panels by lesser-known masters.

{"id": "39638165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39638165", "title": "Earnest Sevier Cox", "text": "Earnest Sevier Cox\n\nEarnest Sevier Cox (January 24, 1880 – April 26, 1966) was an American Methodist preacher, political activist and white-supremacist. He is best known for his political campaigning in favor of stricter segregation between blacks and whites in the United States through tougher anti-miscegenation laws, and for his advocacy for \"repatriation\" of African Americans to Africa, and for his book \"White America\". He is also noted for having mediated collaboration between white southern segregationists and African American separatist organizations such as UNIA and the Peace Movement of Ethiopia to advocate for repatriation legislation, and for having been a personal friend of black racial separatist Marcus Garvey.\n\nEarnest Sevier Cox was born on January 24, 1880, in Blount County, Tennessee, near Knoxville. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Roane College in Tennessee in 1899. He then studied to become a Methodist preacher at the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. He studied Theology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee until 1909, but clashed with the faculty and did not receive a degree. During his studies he worked as a street preacher, but had to give up preaching due to throat problems. He then spent three years studying sociology in graduate school at the University of Chicago, but did not receive a degree. During that time, he studied under Professors Frederick Starr and Edward Alsworth Ross. During his studies in Chicago he became interested in race issues and became a vocal proponent of white supremacy and black inferiority, and of the view that blacks and whites would never become able to peacefully coexist. He started traveling around to give public lectures.\n\nEncouraged by Starr, upon leaving the University of Chicago Cox traveled to Africa, where he spent five years studying interracial relations. He described his trip as an effort of \"finding out how other people control their negroes.\" He worked in the diamond mines in South Africa and later traveled north through Rhodesia, Belgian Congo and German East Africa, north to Egypt. In his writings he extolled the virtues of the German colonies which he considered to be characterized by high degrees of \"racial patriotism\". After returning for a year to South African mines he traveled through South America from Peru and Brazil to Panama. Upon his return to Tennessee he presented himself in his lectures and publications as an explorer, ethnographer and expert on race relations. He became the subject of a piece in the \"New York Times\", describing his travels to study the \"Negro Problem\" in Africa. He also continued giving public lectures and preparing a manuscript for publication. During World War I, he served as a captain in the United States Army, but received honorable discharge when he was found unfit to serve at the front lines. In 1920 he settled in Richmond, where he made a living selling real estate.\n\nIn 1920 he sent a copy of his manuscript on race relations to prominent eugenicist and nordicist Madison Grant, whose 1916 work \"The Passing of the Great Race\" had become an instant classic among scientific racists. He complained to Grant that he could not find a publisher for his work, and Grant supported him by providing basic education in racial anthropological theory, and providing sounder arguments and toning down the emotional tone of the book. Grant also wrote a glowing review of the book, which mentioned him prominently in the acknowledgements. Cox thanked Grant by acting as a political organizer on Grant's behalf, a role that Grant was unable to personally undertake since public political involvement was incompatible with his reputation as a prominent New York patrician.\n\nIn 1922, with composer John Powell, Cox co-founded the Anglo-Saxon Clubs of America, based on Madison Grant's nordicist ideology, in Richmond, Virginia. The group lobbied in favor of anti-miscegenation laws. Grant also requested Cox to act as a campaigner in favor of Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, the version favored by Cox and Grant would have meant that any documented non-white ancestry would be enough to classify an individual as non-white. The final version passed was more lenient, in that it allowed for classification as \"white\" even for people with a small amount of Native American blood.\n\nIn 1943 when anthropologists Ruth Benedict and Gene Weltfish published their pamphlet \"The Races of Mankind\" in which they argued that there was no scientific basis for claims of racial superiority or inferiority, Cox wrote a scathing 22-page review, in which he decried the authors as participants in a Jewish and communist conspiracy in favor of \"atavistic\" and \"perverted\" miscegenation.\n\nIn 1923, unable to find a publisher Cox published the book \"White America\" himself. The book argued that race mixing would result in the downfall of \"White civilization\", and proposed the removal of all people of African descent from the American continent as the solution to the risk of mixing . It was later reissued, funded by Wickliffe Draper. In this book which has been described as a \"crude retelling\" of Madison Grant's Passing of the Great Race, he argued that race science had produced three different findings: 1. That only the white race had ever achieved civilization, 2. that the white race while unmixed with other races had never lost civilization, and 3. that the white race when mixed with other races has never retained civilization. The main chapters of the book were examples of historical civilizations that had disappeared or declined, which Cox interpreted as being the result of contact with \"Colored races\". The last chapters analyzed the \"race problem\" in the US, and provided a proposal for a solution, namely to deport all black people \"of breeding Age\" to Africa.\n\nThe book won positive attention from several important academics and intellectuals in the period, and Cox was invited to Harvard to speak about it by Harry Laughlin the prominent eugenicist. Laughlin's journal \"the Eugenical News\" stated that \"the removal of Negroes would make Cox a greater savior of his country than George Washington\". The book was also incorporated into the biology curriculum at the University of Virginia. It was less well received by anthropologists, and Melville Herskovits reviewed it in the journal Social Forces and described it as \"fallacious in its assumptions, incompetent in its handling and loose in its logic\"\n\nIn 1924 Grant suggested that Cox attend a lecture of African American racial activist Marcus Garvey, whose organization UNIA shared Grant and Cox' passion for racial purity and considered repatriation of African Americans to the African continent to be the only way to salvation of their respective races. In 1924 Cox attended as the only white man, a lecture by Garvey, and after that the two became collaborators, even friends, working conjointly to promoting legislative measures that would allow American Blacks to migrate to Africa. In one of his books, Garvey presented a full page ad for Cox' book \"White America\", without charge. Garvey also endorsed the book as providing the solution to the \"negro Problem\", namely the \"separation of the races\". UNIA also promoted and sold Cox' book, distributing 17,000 copies in Detroit in the 1920s. When Garvey was imprisoned Cox and Powell campaigned for his release, Cox even pleading with the Secretary of Labor. The collaboration between Cox and Garvey ended in 1927 when Garvey was deported to Jamaica, although the friendship between the two persisted. Late in his life Garvey praised Cox and Bilbo, stating that \"These two white men have done wonderfully well for the Negro and should not be forgotten.\" Cox in turn dedicated his 1925 book \"Let My People Go\" to Garvey, and referred to their relation as a \"spiritual understanding.\"\n\nCox continued to collaborate with UNIA and later with the Peace Movement of Ethiopia. In 1936 Cox visited Grant who was by then confined to bed by illness, but who nonetheless agreed to create a $10,000 endowment to fund lobby activities in congress for repatriation and deportation legislation. Grant did not live to make good on his promise, but his friend Wickliffe Draper did it for him and also funded additional printings of Cox' book.\n\nWhen Senator Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi was campaigning for the Greater Liberia Bill of 1939, which asked the United States federal government to provide federal funding for sending African Americans to Liberia, Cox helped him in securing the support of the Garveyites and the Peace Movement of Ethiopia. Cox even had a role in inspiring Bilbo to take on the project, as he had sent him a copy of his book which Bilbo read with pleasure, requesting from Cox copies of his newer writings. Cox also served as an important adviser to Bilbo, cautioning him to tone down his otherwise often inflammatory speech style and to address his Black allies with some degree of respect. The bill, however, failed, partly due to the outbreak of WW2, which drew attention from national legislation and made it impossible to count on the participation of Britain and France in the repatriation efforts. In 1953 when North Dakota senator William Langer proposed a similar repatriation bill, Cox again worked for him as a tireless promoter and publicist, and even spoke in favor of the bill at a hearing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Cox lobbied against the ending of racial segregation in the United States.\n\nIn 1951, he self-published the book \"Teutonic Unity\". In the book, Cox criticized the two World Wars as futile \"fratricides\". The former Methodist had lost his faith, and so also distanced himself from Christianity which he now considered a \"Judaic\" religion, alien to the Teutonic genius. He distributed personally to people that he deemed fellow supporters of the \"Teutonic cause\". Among the recipients was Dr. Johann von Leers, a Nazi fugitive living in Argentina. In his letter to Cox thanking for the book he described his surprise that an American writer would be advocating the same tenets that he had been taught in the SS. He offered to translate the work into German.\n\nIn response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision \"Brown v. Board of Education\" and the ensuing de-segregation of the American school system, he published \"Unending Hate\", in which he argued that the Bill of Rights was in essence a tribal document, only meant to extend rights to those of \"Saxon stock\", not to members of other races, and that in forcing Southern Whites to mingle with Blacks in the school system, the bill of rights was being prostituted.\n\nAs the most prominent surviving nordicist of the generation of the 1920s Cox became a respected figure in the racialist right wing of the 1950s and '60s. He collaborated extensively with white supremacists Willis Carto and Carleton Putnam. Carto's Noontide Press published reprints of several of Cox's early writings. Cox was also a member of the British-based Northern League founded by Roger Pearson, and he was invited to speak at their 1959 conference in the Teutoburger forest. In his address titled \"Herman's brother\" he described Americans as descendants of the brother of the German culture hero Arminius (Herman), who defeated the Romans at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, and hence as \"racial brothers\" of the German people. In 1960 he wrote a letter to George Lincoln Rockwell the founder of the Virginia-based American Nazi Party sending them the address he gave in the Teutoburger forest meeting, and stating that he was in \"fundamental sympathy\" with most of their ideas.\n\nCox died of emphysema on April 26, 1966, in Richmond, Virginia. With no heirs, he left all of his possessions to the repatriation movement. He was buried at the Arlington National Cemetery. His collected papers are hosted at the archive of Duke University.\n\n\n"}

It was administered jointly by the General Register Office (GRO) and The National Archives.\n\nIt opened in March 1997 and was fully operational by the following month. It was situated at 1 Myddelton Street, Clerkenwell, London, close to the London Metropolitan Archives. It closed in 2008.\n\nThroughout the FRC, there was free access to a wide range of family history material, databases and internet websites. Staff were always available to provide help and advice on family history research and there were regular one-to-one family history surgeries and computer skills tutorials. Talks on family history topics took place every week and other events, including exhibitions and conferences, were organised. There were good facilities for customers with special needs, and there was a small bookshop next to the entrance on the ground floor and a refreshment area with vending machines and lockers for personal belongings in the basement.\n\nIts main resources were indexes to civil registration of births, marriages and deaths on the ground floor (provided by the GRO), and the Victorian census returns on the first floor (provided by The National Archives).\n\nThe births, marriages and deaths indexes were in large, heavy, hardcover books (red covers for births, green for marriages and black for deaths) in three sections respectively, with each section arranged in date order. Using the details from an index, a copy (certificate) of the corresponding birth, marriage or death entry could be applied for at the cashiers' section on the same floor. Other indexes at the FRC included some births, marriages and deaths of British nationals which took place abroad, indexes of legal adoptions in England & Wales from 1927 onwards, and various indexes of war deaths in the armed forces in both World Wars.\n\nThe births, marriages and deaths indexes were originally at Somerset House until the 1970s. In the early 1980s, the births and marriages indexes were at St Catherine's House, at the northeast corner of the intersection of Kingsway and Aldwych, and the deaths indexes were at Alexandra House, farther up Kingsway. After more space was made available at St Catherine's House, the deaths indexes were moved from Alexandra House. Finally, they were all moved to the FRC in 1997.\n\nThe 1841 to 1901 census returns for England and Wales could be consulted at the FRC and were accessed mainly online by searching for individuals by name. The 1841 to 1891 census returns were also available on microfilm, while the 1901 census was also available on microfiche. A selection of street indexes and other search aids were also available.\n\nBefore the FRC opened, the census microfilms were at the Public Record Office (now part of the National Archives) in Chancery Lane for some years, after having been moved from the Land Registry building, Portugal Street, London, where they had been since the mid-1970s.\n\nOther microfilm resources available included wills and administrations from the Prerogative Court of Canterbury up to 1858, which could also be searched online, death duty registers, from 1796 to 1858, and many nonconformist registers (mainly pre-1837).\n\nOn 21 June 2006, it was announced that the National Archives' staff and residual services at the FRC would be relocating to the National Archives at Kew by the end of 2008. Official press releases were vague about plans for the births, marriages and deaths indexes housed on the ground floor. During October 2007 the index volumes in question were progressively removed from public access to a closed archive in Christchurch, Dorset.\n\nThe closure date was later brought forward to early 2008.\n\nThe ground floor (GRO section) of the FRC closed on 27 October 2007 and the rest of the FRC closed on 15 March 2008.\n\n"}

In the tales, he was portrayed as physically invulnerable except at his navel/stomach, and was eventually killed (or fated to be killed) by the paladin Roland.\n\n\"Ferracutus\" was the Latin form of the name used in the \"Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle\". Thomas Bulfinch used \"Ferragus\" in his English adaptation \"Legends of Charlemagne\", but the form \"Ferragut\" appears to be the most frequent in English today.\n\nIn his \"Orlando innamorato\", Matteo Maria Boiardo used Feraguto/Feragu (Ferraguto/Ferragu). Ferraù is a syncopated form used in \"Orlando furioso\" by Ludovico Ariosto.\n\nThe character appears in one of the main episodes of the so-called \"Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle\" (\"Historia Caroli Magni\", Book IV of the Codex Calixtinus), a Latin chronicle concerning the feats of Charlemagne and the paladin Roland from the middle of the 12th century.\n\nIn a story modeled on David and Goliath, Roland battles the Saracen giant Ferracutus, who is holding the city of Nájera (Spain). A descendant of Goliath who had been sent to Nájera from Syria by the Emir of Babylon to fight the Christian army of Charlemagne, the giant Ferracutus didn't fear any arrow or spear and had the strength of forty strong men, was nearly twelve cubits tall, with a face a cubit long, a nose a hand long, members nearly four cubits long and fingers the length of three hands. Charlemagne sent several of his men to fight the giant: the Dacian Ogier, Reinaldos of Montalbán, Constantine king of Rome, Count Hoel, and twenty other fighters two by two, who were defeated effortlessly by the giant and put to prison. As soon as Roland obtained permission from Charlemagne, he approached the giant alone and they fought for two days (taking truces to rest at night) using swords, wooden sticks, stones and bare fists. They accidentally killed each other's horses, but Roland could find no way of wounding the giant. During the second night, the courteous Roland placed a stone beneath the head of the giant as a pillow, and upon waking the giant revealed to Roland that he was only vulnerable in one spot: his navel. They also had a conversation about religion discussing matters such as the Holy Trinity, the Genesis, the Immaculate Conception and Resurrection of Jesus. After this conversation another fight took place in which Roland used the knowledge his opponent had given him, and killed Ferragut by inserting a spear in his navel.\n\nThe Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle was a massive success throughout Europe and was frequently adapted or borrowed from until the Renaissance.\n\nAn adaptation of the Pseudo-Turpin story of Ferraguto and his mortal duel with Orlando (Roland) occurs in the anonymous Franco-Venetian epic \"L'Entrée d'Espagne\" (c. 1320; the author is thought to be from Padua).\n\nThe story also appears in the 14th-century Italian epic \"La Spagna\" (attributed to the Florentine Sostegno di Zanobi and likely composed between 1350–1360).\n\nBased in part in the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle (probably via Vincent of Beauvais's \"Speculum Historiale\"), Jean or Jehan Bagnyon's 15th-century \"La Conqueste du grand roy Charlemagne des Espagnes et les vaillances des douze pairs de France, et aussi celles de Fierabras\" (also called \"Fierabras\") includes the story of Ferragus (Book 3, Part 1, Chapters 10–11). This work knew a European success and was adapted into Castilian, Portuguese, German, and English.\n\nWhile the incident is not depicted in it, Ferraguto's death at the hands of Orlando is presented as a well-known fact in Luigi Pulci's epic \"Morgante\".\n\nIn Matteo Maria Boiardo's\" Orlando innamorato\", Ferraguto is a leading Saracen knight (and not a giant), the nephew of King Marsilio of Spain, and one of the many characters passionately in love with Angelica. At the beginning of the poem, Angelica and her brother Argalia arrive at the court of the Emperor Charlemagne in Paris, announcing that any knight who defeats Argalia in single combat will win Angelica's hand in marriage, but if he loses he will become Argalia's prisoner. Ferraguto is among the first knights to try and is unhorsed. However, he angrily refuses to accept his captivity and Argalia and Angelica flee in terror. Ferraguto catches Argalia, kills him and steals his helmet, but he promises the dying man only to wear it for a few days.\n\nAt the beginning of Ludovico Ariosto's \"Orlando furioso\" (a continuation of \"Orlando innamorato\"), Ferraù loses the helmet in a stream and is confronted by the ghost of Argalia, who tells him he must find another helmet instead. Ferraù vows to win the helmet of Almonte, which now belongs to the greatest Christian knight, Orlando. He manages to possess it for a while but Ariosto predicts his ultimate death at the hands of Orlando. Like the character in the Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle and the 14th-century Italian epic \"La Spagna\", Ferraù is completely invulnerable except via his navel.\n\nFerragus is also the name of a completely different Saracen giant from Portugal in the medieval romance \"Valentine and Orson\". Brother of Esclarmonde, he is responsible for imprisoning Bellissant, the sister of King Pepin, and is eventually beheaded by the Duke of Aquitaine .\n\n\n\nThe character is depicted:\n\nOther references:\n"}
{"id": "48664163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48664163", "title": "Flora Antarctica", "text": "Flora Antarctica\n\nThe Flora Antarctica or formally and correctly The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of H.M. Discovery Ships Erebus and Terror in the years 1839–1843, under the Command of Captain Sir James Clark Ross, is a description of the many plants discovered on the Ross expedition, which visited islands off the coast of the Antarctic continent, with a summary of the expedition itself, written by Joseph Dalton Hooker and published in parts between 1844 and 1859 by Reeve Brothers in London. Hooker sailed on HMS \"Erebus\" as assistant surgeon.\n\nThe botanical findings of the Ross expedition were published in four parts, the last two in two volumes each, making six volumes in all:\n\n\nAll were \"splendidly\" illustrated by Walter Hood Fitch. The larger part of the plant specimens collected during this expedition are now part of the Kew Herbarium.\n\nAlthough Hooker professed not to have changed his views on Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, the \"Flora of Tasmania\" contains an introductory essay on biogeography written from a Darwinian point of view, making the book the first case study for the theory.\n\nThe British government fitted out an expedition led by James Clark Ross to investigate magnetism and marine geography in high southern latitudes, which sailed with two ships, HMS \"Terror\" and HMS \"Erebus\" on 29 September 1839 from Chatham.\n\nThe ships docked at Madeira, Tenerife, the Cape Verde archipelago, Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago, Trinidad to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1840. On 21 April the giant kelp \"Macrocystis pyrifera\" was found off Marion Island, but no landfall could be made there or on the Crozet Islands due to the harsh winds. On 12 May the ships anchored at Christmas Harbour for two and a half months, during which all plants previously encountered by James Cook on the Kerguelen Islands were collected. On 20 July they sailed again to arrive on 16 August at the River Derwent, to remain in Tasmania until 12 November. A week later the flotilla stopped at Lord Auckland's Islands and Campbell's Island for the spring months.\n\nLarge floating forests of \"Macrocystis\" and \"Durvillaea\" were found until the ships run into the icebergs at latitude 61° S. Pack-ice was met at 68° S and longitude 175°. During this part of the voyage Victoria Land, Mount Erebus and Mount Terror were discovered. After returning to Tasmania for three months, the flotilla went via Sydney to the Bay of Islands, and stayed for three months in New Zealand to collect the plants.\n\nFrom 6 April 1842 a long stay in the Falklands began, where the flora was investigated to supplement the work of Admiral D’Urville and of the crew of the Uranie. When visiting the Hermite Islands, seedlings of the deciduous \"Nothofagus antarctica\" and the evergreen \"Nothofagus betuloides\" were collected from this southernmost location of any tree (although currently neighboring Hoste Island, slightly more to the North, is commonly mentioned as the southernmost location for trees). These were planted on the Falklands, and some were later brought to Kew. Other plants were also collected. On Cockburn’s Island twenty cryptogam species were found. The ships returned to the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1843. At the end of the journey specimens of some fifteen hundred plant species had been collected and preserved.\n\nJ. D. Hooker gave Charles Darwin a copy of (a draft of) the \"Flora\"; Darwin thanked him, and agreed in November 1845 that the geographical distribution of organisms would be \"the key which will unlock the mystery of species\".\n\nThe book remains important; for example, in 2013 W. H. Walton in his \"Antarctica: Global Science from a Frozen Continent\" describes it as \"a major reference to this day\", encompassing as it does \"all the plants he found both in the Antarctic and on the sub-Antarctic islands\", surviving better than Ross's deep-sea soundings which were made with \"inadequate equipment\".\n\nThe four parts of the \"Flora Antarctica\" total 6 volumes, describe about 3000 species, and contain 530 plates which figure 1095 of the species.\n\nPart I, published between 1843 and 1845, covers the \"Flora of Lord Auckland and Campbell's Islands\". It has 208 pages, 370 species, 80 plates and map, and figures 150 species.\n\nPart II, published between 1845 and 1847, covers the \"Flora of Fuegia, the Falklands, Kerguellen's land, etc.\" It has 366 pages, 1000 species, 120 plates, and figures 220 species.\n\nAccording to Hooker, the flora of New Zealand's Antarctic islands is so different from that of the remainder of the territories visited during the voyage, that it merits a separate description. An exemplary difference is the dominance of Asteraceae in New Zealand's islands, and absence of representatives of the Rubiaceae, while the reverse is true for those two plant families on the other Antarctic archipelagos. So the \"Flora Antarctica\" describes in its second part the plants of Tierra del Fuego and the south-western coast of Patagonia, the Falkland Islands, Palmer's Land, South Shetlands, South Georgia, Tristan da Cunha, and Kerguellen's Land.\n\nPart III, the \"Flora of New Zealand\" or \"Flora Nova-Zelandiae\", was published in two volumes between 1851 and 1853.\n\n\nPart IV, the \"Flora of Tasmania\" or \"Flora Tasmaniae\" was published in two volumes between 1853 and 1859.\n\n\nHooker dedicated this Part to the local naturalists Ronald Campbell Gunn and William Archer, noting that \"This Flora of Tasmania .. owes so much to their indefatigable exertions\". Although the book is sometimes stated to have been published in 1859, the dedication is dated January 1860. It made use of plants collected by the local naturalist Robert Lawrence as well as Gunn and Archer.\n\nThe book begins with an \"Introductory Essay\" on biogeography. It is followed by a \"Key to the Natural Orders of Tasmanian Flowering Plants\" and a more detailed key to the genera. The Flora proper begins with the first order, the Ranunculaceae.\n\n\"Flora Tasmaniae\" was \"the first published case study supporting Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection\". It contained a \"milestone essay on biogeography\", \"one of the first major public endorsements of the theory [of evolution by natural selection]\". Hooker gradually changed his mind on evolution as he wrote up his findings from the Ross expedition. While he asserted that \"my own views on the subjects of the variability of existing species\" remain \"unaltered from those which I maintained in the 'Flora of New Zealand'\", the \"Flora Tasmaniae\" is written from a Darwinian perspective that effectively assumes natural selection, or as Hooker named it, the \"variation\" theory, to be correct.\n\n"}
{"id": "14072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14072", "title": "History of Wikipedia", "text": "History of Wikipedia\n\nWikipedia began with its launch on 15 January 2001, two days after the domain was registered by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Its technological and conceptual underpinnings predate this; the earliest known proposal for an online encyclopedia was made by Rick Gates in 1993, but the concept of a free-as-in-freedom online encyclopedia (as distinct from mere open source) was proposed by Richard Stallman in December 2000.\n\nCrucially, Stallman's concept specifically included the idea that no central organization should control editing. This characteristic was in stark contrast to contemporary digital encyclopedias such as Microsoft Encarta, \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", and even Bomis's Nupedia, which was Wikipedia's direct predecessor. In 2001, the license for Nupedia was changed to GFDL, and Wales and Sanger launched Wikipedia using the concept and technology of a wiki pioneered in 1995 by Ward Cunningham. Initially, Wikipedia was intended to complement Nupedia, an online encyclopedia project edited solely by experts, by providing additional draft articles and ideas for it. In practice, Wikipedia quickly overtook Nupedia, becoming a global project in multiple languages and inspiring a wide range of other online reference projects.\n\nAccording to Alexa Internet, as of 16 September 2018, Wikipedia is the world's fifth-most-popular website in terms of overall visitor traffic. Wikipedia's worldwide monthly readership is approximately 495 million. Worldwide in September 2018, WMF Labs tallied 15.5 billion page views for the month. According to comScore, Wikipedia receives over 117 million monthly unique visitors from the United States alone.\n\nThe concept of compiling the world's knowledge in a single location dates back to the ancient Libraries of Alexandria and Pergamum, but the modern concept of a general-purpose, widely distributed, printed encyclopedia originated with Denis Diderot and the 18th-century French encyclopedists. The idea of using automated machinery beyond the printing press to build a more useful encyclopedia can be traced to Paul Otlet's 1934 book \"Traité de documentation\"; Otlet also founded the Mundaneum, an institution dedicated to indexing the world's knowledge, in 1910. This concept of a machine-assisted encyclopedia was further expanded in H. G. Wells' book of essays \"World Brain\" (1938) and Vannevar Bush's future vision of the microfilm-based Memex in his essay \"As We May Think\" (1945). Another milestone was Ted Nelson's hypertext design Project Xanadu, which was begun in 1960.\n\nAdvances in information technology in the late 20th century led to changes in the form of encyclopedias. While previous encyclopedias, notably the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", were book-based, Microsoft's Encarta, published in 1993, was available on CD-ROM and hyperlinked. The development of the World Wide Web led to many attempts to develop internet encyclopedia projects. An early proposal for a web-based encyclopedia was Interpedia in 1993 by Rick Gates; this project died before generating any encyclopedic content. Free software proponent Richard Stallman described the usefulness of a \"Free Universal Encyclopedia and Learning Resource\" in 1999. His published document \"aims to lay out what the free encyclopedia needs to do, what sort of freedoms it needs to give the public, and how we can get started on developing it.\" On Wednesday 17 January 2001, two days after the founding of Wikipedia, the Free Software Foundation's (FSF) GNUPedia project went online, competing with Nupedia, but today the FSF encourages people \"to visit and contribute to [Wikipedia]\".\n\nWikipedia was initially conceived as a feeder project for the Wales-founded Nupedia, an earlier project to produce a free online encyclopedia, volunteered by Bomis, a web-advertising firm owned by Jimmy Wales, Tim Shell and Michael E. Davis. Nupedia was founded upon the use of highly qualified volunteer contributors and an elaborate multi-step peer review process. Despite its mailing list of interested editors, and the presence of a full-time editor-in-chief, Larry Sanger, a graduate philosophy student hired by Wales, the writing of content for Nupedia was extremely slow, with only 12 articles written during the first year.\n\nWales and Sanger discussed various ways to create content more rapidly. The idea of a wiki-based complement originated from a conversation between Larry M. Sanger and Ben Kovitz. Ben Kovitz was a computer programmer and regular on Ward Cunningham's revolutionary wiki \"the WikiWikiWeb\". He explained to Sanger what wikis were, at that time a difficult concept to understand, over a dinner on Tuesday 2 January 2001. Wales first stated, in October 2001, that \"Larry had the idea to use Wiki software\", though he later stated in December 2005 that Jeremy Rosenfeld, a Bomis employee, introduced him to the concept. Sanger thought a wiki would be a good platform to use, and proposed on the Nupedia mailing list that a wiki based upon UseModWiki (then v. 0.90) be set up as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia. Under the subject \"Let's make a wiki\", he wrote:\nWales set one up and put it online on Wednesday 10 January 2001.\n\nThere was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a wiki-style website. Sanger suggested giving the new project its own name, \"Wikipedia\", and Wikipedia was soon launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on Monday 15 January 2001. The bandwidth and server (located in San Diego) used for these initial projects were donated by Bomis. Many former Bomis employees later contributed content to the encyclopedia: notably Tim Shell, co-founder and later CEO of Bomis, and programmer Jason Richey.\n\nWales stated in December 2008 that he made Wikipedia's first edit, a test edit with the text \"Hello, World!\", but this edit may have been to an old version of Wikipedia which soon after was scrapped and replaced by a restart; see . The oldest article still preserved is the article UuU, created on Tuesday 16 January 2001, at 21:08 UTC. The existence of the project was formally announced and an appeal for volunteers to engage in content creation was made to the Nupedia mailing list on 17 January 2001.\nThe project received many new participants after being mentioned on the Slashdot website in July 2001, having already earned two minor mentions in March 2001. It then received a prominent pointer to a story on the community-edited technology and culture website Kuro5hin on 25 July. Between these relatively rapid influxes of traffic, there had been a steady stream of traffic from other sources, especially Google, which alone sent hundreds of new visitors to the site every day. Its first major mainstream media coverage was in \"The New York Times\" on Thursday 20 September 2001.\n\nThe project gained its 1,000th article around Monday 12 February 2001, and reached 10,000 articles around 7 September. In the first year of its existence, over 20,000 encyclopedia entries were created – a rate of over 1,500 articles per month. On Friday 30 August 2002, the article count reached 40,000.\n\nWikipedia's earliest edits were long believed lost, since the original UseModWiki software deleted old data after about a month. On Tuesday 14 December 2010, developer Tim Starling found backups on SourceForge containing every change made to Wikipedia from its creation in January 2001 to 17 August 2001. It showed the first edit as being to HomePage on 15 January 2001, reading \"This is the new WikiPedia!\".\n\nThe first three edits that were known of before Tim Starling's discovery, are:\nFor more information see .\n\nEarly in Wikipedia's development, it began to expand internationally, with the creation of new namespaces, each with a distinct set of usernames. The first subdomain created for a non-English Wikipedia was \"deutsche.wikipedia.com\" (created on Friday 16 March 2001, 01:38 UTC), followed after a few hours by \"Catalan.wikipedia.com\" (at 13:07 UTC). The Japanese Wikipedia, started as nihongo.wikipedia.com, was created around that period, and initially used only Romanized Japanese. For about two months Catalan was the one with the most articles in a non-English language, although statistics of that early period are imprecise. The French Wikipedia was created on or around 11 May 2001, in a wave of new language versions that also included Chinese, Dutch, Esperanto, Hebrew, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. These languages were soon joined by Arabic and Hungarian. In September 2001, an announcement pledged commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia, notifying users of an upcoming roll-out of Wikipedias for all major languages, the establishment of core standards, and a push for the translation of core pages for the new wikis. At the end of that year, when international statistics first began to be logged, Afrikaans, Norwegian, and Serbian versions were announced.\n\nIn January 2002, 90% of all Wikipedia articles were in English. By January 2004, fewer than 50% were English, and this internationalization has continued to increase as the encyclopedia grows. , about 85.5% of all Wikipedia articles are contained within non-English Wikipedia versions.\n\nIn March 2002, following the withdrawal of funding by Bomis during the dot-com bust, Larry Sanger left both Nupedia and Wikipedia. By 2002, Sanger and Wales differed in their views on how best to manage open encyclopedias. Both still supported the open-collaboration concept, but the two disagreed on how to handle disruptive editors, specific roles for experts, and the best way to guide the project to success.\n\nWales went on to establish self-governance and bottom-up self-direction by editors on Wikipedia. He made it clear that he would not be involved in the community's day-to-day management, but would encourage it to learn to self-manage and find its own best approaches. , Wales mostly restricts his own role to occasional input on serious matters, executive activity, advocacy of knowledge, and encouragement of similar reference projects.\n\nSanger says he is an \"inclusionist\" and is open to almost anything. He proposed that experts still have a place in the Web 2.0 world. He returned briefly to academia, then joined the Digital Universe Foundation. In 2006, Sanger founded Citizendium, an open encyclopedia that used real names for contributors in an effort to reduce disruptive editing, and hoped to facilitate \"gentle expert guidance\" to increase the accuracy of its content. Decisions about article content were to be up to the community, but the site was to include a statement about \"family-friendly content\". He stated early on that he intended to leave Citizendium in a few years, by which time the project and its management would presumably be established.\n\nThe Wikipedia project has grown rapidly in the course of its life, at several levels. Content has grown organically through the addition of new articles, new wikis have been added in English and non-English languages, and entire new projects replicating these growth methods in other related areas (news, quotations, reference books and so on) have been founded as well. Wikipedia itself has grown, with the creation of the Wikimedia Foundation to act as an umbrella body and the growth of software and policies to address the needs of the editorial community. These are documented below:\n\nIn March 2000, the Nupedia project was started. Its intention was to publish articles written by experts which would be licensed as free content. Nupedia was founded by Jimmy Wales, with Larry Sanger as editor-in-chief, and funded by the web-advertising company Bomis.\n\nIn January 2001, Wikipedia began as a side-project of Nupedia, to allow collaboration on articles prior to entering the peer-review process. The name was suggested by Sanger on 11 January 2001. The \"wikipedia.com\" and \"wikipedia.org\" domain names were registered on 12 and 13 January, respectively, with \"wikipedia.org\" being brought online on the same day. The project formally opened on 15 January (\"\"), with the first international Wikipedias – the French, German, Catalan, Swedish, and Italian editions – being created between March and May. The \"neutral point of view\" (NPOV) policy was officially formulated at this time, and Wikipedia's first slashdotter wave arrived on 26 July. The first media report about Wikipedia appeared in August 2001 in the newspaper \"Wales on Sunday\". The September 11 attacks spurred the appearance of breaking news stories on the homepage, as well as information boxes linking related articles.\n\n2002 saw the end of funding for Wikipedia from Bomis and the departure of Larry Sanger. The forking of the Spanish Wikipedia also took place with the establishment of the \"Enciclopedia Libre\". The first portable MediaWiki software went live on 25 January. Bots were introduced, Jimmy Wales confirmed that Wikipedia would never run commercial advertising, and the first sister project (Wiktionary) and first formal Manual of Style were launched. A separate board of directors to supervise the project was proposed and initially discussed at Meta-Wikipedia.\n\nThe English Wikipedia passed 100,000 articles in 2003, while the next largest edition, the German Wikipedia, passed 10,000. The Wikimedia Foundation was established, and Wikipedia adopted its jigsaw world logo. Mathematical formulae using TeX were reintroduced to the website. The took place in Munich, Germany, in October. The basic principles of Wikipedia's (known colloquially as \"ArbCom\") were developed, mostly by , and other early Wikipedians.\n\nWikisource was created as a separate project on 24 November 2003, to host free textual sources.\n\nThe worldwide Wikipedia article pool continued to grow rapidly in 2004, doubling in size in 12 months, from under 500,000 articles in late 2003 to over 1 million in over 100 languages by the end of 2004. The English Wikipedia accounted for just under half of these articles. The website's server farms were moved from California to Florida, and CSS style configuration sheets were introduced, and the first attempt to block Wikipedia occurred, with the website being blocked in China for two weeks in June. The formal election of a board and Arbitration Committee began. The first formal projects were proposed to deliberately balance content and seek out systemic bias arising from Wikipedia's community structure.\n\n\"Bourgeois v. Peters\", (11th Cir. 2004), a court case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was one of the earliest . It stated: \"We also reject the notion that the Department of Homeland Security's threat advisory level somehow justifies these searches. Although the threat level was 'elevated' at the time of the protest, 'to date, the threat level has stood at yellow (elevated) for the majority of its time in existence. It has been raised to orange (high) six times.\"\n\nWikimedia Commons was created on 7 September 2004 to host media files for Wikipedia in all languages.\n\nIn 2005, Wikipedia became the most popular reference website on the Internet, according to Hitwise, with the English Wikipedia alone exceeding 750,000 articles. Wikipedia's first multilingual and subject portals were established in 2005. A formal fundraiser held in the first quarter of the year raised almost US$100,000 for system upgrades to handle growing demand. China again blocked Wikipedia in October 2005.\n\nThe first major Wikipedia scandal, the Seigenthaler incident, occurred in 2005, when a well-known figure was found to have a vandalized biography which had gone unnoticed for months. In the wake of this and other concerns, the first policy and system changes specifically designed to counter this form of abuse were established. These included a new privilege policy update to assist in sock puppetry investigations, a new feature called , a more strict policy on biographies of living people and the tagging of such articles for stricter review. A restriction of new article creation to registered users only was put in place in December 2005.\nWikimania 2005, the first Wikimania conference, was held from 4 to 8 August 2005 at the \"Haus der Jugend\" in Frankfurt, Germany, attracting about 380 attendees.\n\nThe English Wikipedia gained its one-millionth article, Jordanhill railway station, on 1 March 2006. The first approved Wikipedia article selection was made freely available to download, and \"Wikipedia\" became registered as a trademark of the Wikimedia Foundation. The congressional aides biography scandals – multiple incidents in which congressional staffers and a campaign manager were caught trying to covertly alter Wikipedia biographies – came to public attention, leading to the resignation of the campaign manager. Nonetheless, Wikipedia was rated as one of the top five global brands of 2006.\n\nJimmy Wales indicated at Wikimania 2006 that Wikipedia had achieved sufficient volume and called for an emphasis on quality, perhaps best expressed in the call for . A new privilege, \"oversight\", was created, allowing specific versions of archived pages with unacceptable content to be marked as non-viewable. Semi-protection against anonymous vandalism, introduced in 2005, proved more popular than expected, with over 1,000 pages being semi-protected at any given time in 2006.\n\nWikipedia continued to grow rapidly in 2007, possessing over 5 million registered editor accounts by 13 August. The 250 language editions of Wikipedia contained a combined total of 7.5 million articles, totalling 1.74 billion words, by 13 August. The English Wikipedia gained articles at a steady rate of 1,700 a day, with the wikipedia.org domain name ranked the 10th-busiest in the world. Wikipedia continued to garner visibility in – the Essjay controversy broke when a prominent member of Wikipedia was found to have lied about his credentials. Citizendium, a competing online encyclopedia, launched publicly. A new trend developed in Wikipedia, with the encyclopedia addressing people whose notability stemmed from being a participant in a news story by adding a redirect from their name to the larger story, rather than creating a distinct biographical article. On 9 September 2007, the English Wikipedia gained its two-millionth article, El Hormiguero. There was some controversy in late 2007 when the Volapük Wikipedia jumped from 797 to over 112,000 articles, briefly becoming the 15th-largest Wikipedia edition, due to automated stub generation by an enthusiast for the Volapük constructed language.\n\nAccording to the \"MIT Technology Review\", the number of regularly active editors on the English-language Wikipedia peaked in 2007 at more than 51,000, and has since been declining.\n\nVarious in many areas continued to expand and refine article contents within their scope. In April 2008, the 10-millionth Wikipedia article was created, and by the end of the year the English Wikipedia exceeded 2.5 million articles.\n\nOn 25 June 2009 at 3:15 pm PDT (22:15 UTC), following pop icon Michael Jackson's death, the website temporarily crashed.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation reported nearly a million visitors to Jackson's biography within one hour, probably the most visitors in a one-hour period to any article in Wikipedia's history. By late August 2009, the number of articles in all Wikipedia editions had exceeded 14 million. The three-millionth article on the English Wikipedia, Beate Eriksen, was created on 17 August 2009 at 04:05 UTC. On 27 December 2009, the German Wikipedia exceeded one million articles, becoming the second edition after the English Wikipedia to do so. A \"TIME\" article listed Wikipedia among 2009's best websites.\n\nWikipedia content became licensed under Creative Commons in 2009.\n\nOn 24 March, the European Wikipedia servers went offline due to an overheating problem. Failover to servers in Florida turned out to be broken, causing DNS resolution for Wikipedia to fail across the world. The problem was resolved quickly, but due to DNS caching effects, some areas were slower to regain access to Wikipedia than others.\n\nOn 13 May, the site released a new interface. New features included an updated logo, new navigation tools, and a link wizard. However, the classic interface remained available for those who wished to use it. On 12 December, the English Wikipedia passed the 3.5-million-article mark, while the French Wikipedia's millionth article was created on 21 September. The 1-billionth Wikimedia project edit was performed on 16 April.\n\nWikipedia and its users held hundreds of celebrations worldwide to commemorate the site's 10th anniversary on 15 January. The site began efforts to expand its growth in India, holding its first Indian conference in Mumbai in November 2011. The English Wikipedia passed the 3.6-million-article mark on 2 April, and reached 3.8 million articles on 18 November. On 7 November 2011, the German Wikipedia exceeded 100 million page edits, becoming the second language edition to do so after the English edition, which attained 500 million page edits on 24 November 2011. The Dutch Wikipedia exceeded 1 million articles on 17 December 2011, becoming the fourth Wikipedia edition to do so.\n\nThe \"Wikimania 2011 – Haifa, Israel\" stamp was issued by Israel Post on 2 August 2011. This was the first-ever stamp dedicated to a Wikimedia-related project.\n\nBetween 4 and 6 October 2011, the Italian Wikipedia became intentionally inaccessible in protest against the Italian Parliament's proposed DDL intercettazioni law, which, if approved, would allow any person to force websites to remove information that is perceived as untrue or offensive, without the need to provide evidence.\n\nAlso in October 2011, Wikimedia announced the launch of Wikipedia Zero, an initiative to enable free mobile access to Wikipedia in developing countries through partnerships with mobile operators.\n\nOn 16 January, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales announced that the English Wikipedia would shut down for 24 hours on 18 January as part of a protest meant to call public attention to the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act and PROTECT IP Act, two anti-piracy laws under debate in the United States Congress. Calling the blackout a \"community decision\", Wales and other opponents of the laws believed that they would endanger free speech and online innovation. A similar blackout was staged on 10 July by the Russian Wikipedia, in protest against a proposed Russian internet regulation law.\n\nIn late March 2012, the announced Wikidata, a universal platform for sharing data between all Wikipedia language editions. The US$1.7-million Wikidata project was partly funded by Google, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Wikimedia Deutschland assumed responsibility for the first phase of Wikidata, and initially planned to make the platform available to editors by December 2012. Wikidata's first phase became fully operational in March 2013.\nIn April 2012, Justin Knapp became the first single contributor to make over one million edits to Wikipedia. Jimmy Wales congratulated Knapp for his work and presented him with the site's \"Special Barnstar\" medal and the \"Golden Wiki\" award for his achievement. Wales also declared that 20 April would be \"Justin Knapp Day\".\n\nOn 13 July 2012, the English Wikipedia gained its 4-millionth article, Izbat al-Burj. In October 2012, historian and Wikipedia editor Richard J. Jensen opined that the English Wikipedia was \"nearing completion\", noting that the number of regularly active editors had fallen significantly since 2007, despite Wikipedia's rapid growth in article count and readership.\n\nAccording to Alexa Internet, Wikipedia was the world's sixth-most-popular website as of November 2012. Dow Jones ranked Wikipedia fifth worldwide as of December 2012.\n\nOn 22 January 2013, the Italian Wikipedia became the fifth language edition of Wikipedia to exceed 1 million articles, while the Russian and Spanish Wikipedias gained their millionth articles on 11 and 16 May respectively. On 15 July the Swedish and on 24 September the Polish Wikipedias gained their millionth articles, becoming the eighth and ninth Wikipedia editions to do so.\n\nOn 27 January, the main belt asteroid 274301 was officially renamed \"Wikipedia\" by the Committee for Small Body Nomenclature.\n\nThe first phase of the Wikidata database, automatically providing interlanguage links and other data, became available for all language editions in March 2013.\n\nIn April 2013, the French secret service was accused of attempting to censor Wikipedia by threatening a Wikipedia volunteer with arrest unless \"classified information\" about a military radio station was deleted.\nIn July, the VisualEditor editing system was launched, forming the first stage of an effort to allow articles to be edited with a word processor-like interface instead of using wikimarkup. An editor specifically designed for smartphones and other mobile devices was also launched.\n\nA print edition of the English Wikipedia, comprising 1,000 volumes and over 1,100,000 pages, was exhibited by German Wikipedia contributors in 2014. The project sought funding through Indiegogo, and was intended to honor the contributions of Wikipedia's editors. On 22 October 2014, the first monument to Wikipedia was unveiled in the Polish town of Slubice.\n\nIn mid-2015, Wikipedia was the world's seventh-most-popular website according to Alexa Internet, down one place from the position it held in November 2012. At the start of 2015, Wikipedia remained the largest general-knowledge encyclopedia online, with a combined total of over 36 million mainspace articles across all 291 language editions. On average, Wikipedia receives a total of 10 billion global pageviews from around 495 million unique visitors every month, including 85 million visitors from the United States alone, where it is the sixth-most-popular site.\n\"Print Wikipedia\" was an art project by Michael Mandiberg that printed out the 7473 volumes of Wikipedia as it existed on 7 April 2015. Each volume has 700 pages.\n\nOn 1 November 2015, the English Wikipedia reached 5,000,000 articles with the creation of an article on \"Persoonia terminalis\", a type of shrub.\n\nIn mid-2016, Wikipedia was once again the world's sixth-most-popular website according to Alexa Internet, up one place from the position it held in the previous year.\n\nIn October 2016, the mobile version of Wikipedia got a new look.\n\nIn mid-2017, Wikipedia was listed as the world's fifth-most-popular website according to Alexa Internet, rising one place from the position it held in the previous year. Wikipedia Zero was made available in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nOn 29 April 2017, the Turkish authorities blocked online access to Wikipedia in all languages across Turkey. The encrypted Japanese Wikipedia has been blocked in China since 28 December 2017.\n\nDuring 2018, Wikipedia retained its listing as the world's fifth-most-popular website according to Alexa Internet. One notable development was the use of Artificial Intelligence to create draft articles on overlooked topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery year, Wikipedia runs a fundraising campaign to support its operations.\n\n\nBecause Wikipedia biographies are often updated as soon as new information comes to light, they are often used as a reference source on the lives of . This has led to attempts to manipulate and falsify Wikipedia articles for promotional or defamatory purposes (see Controversies). It has also led to novel uses of the biographical material provided. Some notable people's lives are being affected by their Wikipedia biography.\n\nSanger played an important role in the early stages of creating Wikipedia. Wales says that Sanger was his subordinate employee. Sanger initially brought the wiki concept to Wales and suggested it be applied to Nupedia and then, after some initial skepticism, Wales agreed to try it. It was Jimmy Wales, along with other people, who came up with the broader idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that would accept contributions from ordinary people and it was Wales who invested in it. Wales stated in October 2001 that \"Larry had the idea to use Wiki software.\" Sanger coined the portmanteau \"Wikipedia\" as the project name. In review, Larry Sanger conceived of a wiki-based encyclopedia as a strategic solution to Nupedia's inefficiency problems. In terms of project roles, Sanger spearheaded and pursued the project as its leader in its first year, and did most of the early work in formulating policies (including \"Ignore all rules\" and \"Neutral point of view\") and building up the community. Upon departure in March 2002, Sanger emphasized the main issue was purely the cessation of Bomis' funding for his role, which was not viable part-time, and his changing personal priorities; however, by 2004, the two had drifted apart and Sanger became more critical. Two weeks after the launch of Citizendium, Sanger criticized Wikipedia, describing the latter as \"broken beyond repair.\" By 2005 Wales began to dispute Sanger's role in the project, three years after Sanger left.\n\nIn 2005, Wales described himself simply as the founder of Wikipedia; however, according to Brian Bergstein of the Associated Press, \"Sanger has long been cited as a co-founder.\" There is evidence that Sanger was called co-founder, along with Wales, as early as 2001, and he is referred to as such in early Wikipedia press releases and Wikipedia articles and in a September 2001 \"New York Times\" article for which both were interviewed. In 2006, Wales said, \"He used to work for me [...] I don't agree with calling him a co-founder, but he likes the title\"; nonetheless, before January 2004, Wales did not dispute Sanger's status as co-founder and, indeed, identified himself as \"co-founder\" as late as August 2002. In Sanger's introductory message to the Nupedia mailing list, he said that \"Jimmy Wales contacted me and asked me to apply as editor-in-chief of Nupedia. Apparently, Bomis, Inc. (which owns Nupedia)... who could manage this sort of long-term project, he thought I would be perfect for the job. This is indeed my dream job\". Sanger said \"He [Wales] had had the idea for Nupedia since at least last fall\".\n\nAs of March 2007: Wales emphasized this employer–employee relationship and his ultimate authority, terming himself Wikipedia's sole founder; and Sanger emphasized their statuses as co-founders, referencing earlier versions of Wikipedia pages (2004, 2006), press releases (2002–2004), and media coverage from the time of his involvement routinely terming them in this manner.\n\n\n\nThe goals which led to GNUpedia were published at least as early as 18 December 2000, and these exact goals were finalized on the 12th and 13th of January 2001, albeit with a copyright of 1999, from when Stallman had first started considering the problem. The only sentence added between 18 December and the unveiling of GNUpedia the week of 12–16 January was this: \"The GNU Free Documentation License would be a good license to use for courses.\"\n\nGNUpedia was \"formally\" announced on the \"slashdot\" website, on 16 January, the same day that their mailing list first went online with a test-message. Wales posted to the list on 17 January, the first full day of messages, explaining the discussions with Stallman concerning the change in Nupedia content-licensing, and suggesting cooperation. Stallman himself first posted on 19 January, and, in his second post on 22 January, mentioned that discussions about merging Wikipedia and GNUpedia were ongoing. Within a couple of months, Wales had changed his email signature from the open source encyclopedia to the free encyclopedia; both Nupedia and Wikipedia had adopted the GFDL; and the merger of GNUpedia into Wikipedia was effectively accomplished.\n\nIn a separate but similar incident, the campaign manager for Cathy Cox, Morton Brilliant, resigned after being found to have added negative information to the Wikipedia entries of political opponents. Following media publicity, the incidents tapered off around August 2006.\n\nThere are a number of . Other sites also use the MediaWiki software and concept, popularized by Wikipedia. No list of them is maintained.\n\nSpecialized foreign language forks using the Wikipedia concept include Enciclopedia Libre (Spanish), \"Wikiweise\" (German), WikiZnanie (Russian), Susning.nu (Swedish), and Baidu Baike (Chinese). Some of these (such as \"Enciclopedia Libre\") use GFDL or compatible licenses as used by Wikipedia, leading to exchange of material with their respective language Wikipedias.\n\nIn 2006, Larry Sanger founded Citizendium, based upon a modified version of MediaWiki. The site said it aimed 'to improve on the Wikipedia model with \"gentle expert oversight\", among other things'. (See also Nupedia).\n\nThe German Wikipedia was the first to be partly published also using other media (rather than online on the internet), including releases on CD in November 2004 and more extended versions on CDs or DVD in April 2005 and December 2006. In December 2005, the publisher Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, a sister company of Directmedia, published a 139-page book explaining Wikipedia, its history and policies, which was accompanied by a 7.5 GB DVD containing 300,000 articles and 100,000 images from the German Wikipedia. Originally, Directmedia also announced plans to print the German Wikipedia in its entirety, in 100 volumes of 800 pages each. Publication was due to begin in October 2006, and finish in 2010. In March 2006, however, this project was called off.\n\nIn September 2008, Bertelsmann published a 1000 pages volume with a selection of popular German Wikipedia articles. Bertelsmann paid voluntarily 1 Euro per sold copy to Wikimedia Deutschland.\n\nThe first CD version containing a selection of articles from the English Wikipedia was published in April 2006 by as the \"2006 Wikipedia CD Selection\". In April 2007, \"Wikipedia Version 0.5\", a CD containing around 2000 articles selected from the online encyclopedia was published by the Wikimedia Foundation and Linterweb. The selection of articles included was based on both the quality of the online version and the importance of the topic to be included. This CD version was created as a test-case in preparation for a DVD version including far more articles. The CD version can be purchased online, downloaded as a DVD image file or , or accessed online at the project's website.\n\nA free software project has also been launched to make a static version of Wikipedia available for use on iPods. The \"Encyclopodia\" project was started around March 2006 and can currently be used on 1st to 4th generation iPods.\n\nIn limited ways, the Wikimedia Foundation is protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. In the defamation action \"Bauer et al. v. Glatzer et al.\", it was held that Wikimedia had no case to answer because of this section. A similar law in France caused a lawsuit to be dismissed in October 2007. In 2013, a German appeals court (the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart) ruled that Wikipedia is a \"service provider\" not a \"content provider\", and as such is immune from liability as long as it takes down content that is accused of being illegal.\n\n\nHistorical summaries\n\nSize and statistics\n\nDiscussion and debate archives\n\nOther\n"}

The linguistic influences of the Japanese in Hawaii began with the first immigrants from Japan in 1868 and continues with the large Japanese American population in Hawaii today.\n\nThere are other Japanese words common among the Japanese American population (such as \"okazu\" and \"obaachan\"), but not as well-known among Hawaii's general population. Such words have not been included here, nor have Japanese words which have entered the English language on a national level, such as \"anime,\" () \"karaoke,\" () \"samurai,\" () and \"sushi\" (). Hawaii is also unique in the United States in that Japanese loanwords often retain Japanese pronunciation, as in the rolled \"r\" sound in words like \"karaoke,\" \"furikake,\" and \"karate.\" \n\nSome words are not from the standard Japanese language. They instead originated from Japan's regional dialects. For example, the word \"bobora\" is said to be spoken only in certain prefectures, especially in western Japan where many of the Japanese immigrants came from. It originates from the Portuguese word \"abóbora\" meaning Japanese pumpkin.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15466592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15466592", "title": "John of Saxony (astronomer)", "text": "John of Saxony (astronomer)\n\nJohn of Saxony or Johannes de Saxonia or John Danko or Dancowe of Saxony was a medieval astronomer. Although his exact birthplace is unknown it is believed he was born in Germany, most likely Magdeburg. His scholarly work is believed to date from the end of the 13th century into the mid 14th century. He spent most of his active career, from about 1327 to 1355, at the University of Paris.\n\nJohn of Saxony is quoted in various medieval manuscripts and referenced as the author of various astronomical or astrological treatises, even though his authorship in some cases is questionable.\n\nA \"computus\" dating back to 1297 is attributed to John of Saxony even though the author is listed as Iohannes Alemanus. The fact that the geographical longitudes of Paris and Magdeburg, considered John's birthplace, among other facts is why some historians consider him the author.\n\nViewed with less suspicion is his commentary on \"Liber Introductorius ad Magisterium Idiciorum Astrorum\" written by al-Qabisi (Alcabitius) an Arab scholar from the late 10th century. John of Saxony's commentary on this treatise is preserved in many manuscripts, several incunabula and old prints, the latest of which dates from the middle of the 16th century.\n\nAmong his other contributions were a commentary on Alcabitius's \"Introduction to the art of astrology,\" which went through eleven printed editions, and an \"Almanach\" for the years 1336 to 1380 that he computed for the meridian of Paris using the Alfonsine tables.\n\nJohn of Saxony was of the opinion that astronomers of that time wrote their works in such a confusing manner that those who weren't trained in the field couldn't comprehend nor use appropriately. Under the tutelage of his master, John of Ligneres, he sought to write tables that accounted for any situation and could be put to practical use. As he puts it \"Therefore to the praise of glorious God, the honor of my master, and the profit of scholars who wish to learn the workings of astronomical tables, I, John of Saxony, with God's aid intend to give examples of all the operations which are commonly performed with tables so that there may be no one henceforth who will shrink from the use and employment of tables of the stars because of the difficulty working with them.\"\n\nThe more widely recognized work by John of Saxony is his \"Canons\" on the Alfonsine Tables. The Alfonsine Tables are the mathematical calculations from Ptolemy's Almagest with limited modifications. These tables for calculating planetary positions, prepared under the auspices of Alfonso X, were originally in Castillian. They were also used to derive ecliptic longitudes or planets for any chosen time and observer's position, lunar phases, lunar and solar eclipses, as well as calendar dates. Like the 11th century Toledan Tables before them, the Alfonsine Tables were based on the geocentric model of the planetary system as described in Ptolemy's Almagest. Around 1320, the Alfonsine Tables appeared in Paris where they were studied at the University of Paris by astronomers John of Ligneres, John of Saxony, and later Johannes de Muris.\n\nIn order to study the tables, they were translated from Castillian into Latin which was the scholarly language of the day. This is due in large part to the Catholic upbringing of the day in medieval Europe. This act alone allowed greater access and understanding of astronomical work to that point. In 1327 he added an influential set of explanations and instructions (\"Canons\") to the revision of the \"Alfonsine Tables\" by his master, John of Linières. His intent was to allow students at the University of Paris to utilize the astronomical tables.\n\nThe canons of John of Saxony explained how one could find the planetary position (longitudes) at any given time. One would have to calculate the length of time between the basic year and they year sought. They would then divide them by mean figures of the planetary orbits, and add/subtract values to adjust for hours and minutes. To expedite these calculations he had an accompanying table of sexagesimal multiplication. In addition to this, he divided the day into sixty parts rather than 24 hours, consistently representing time by sexagesimal fractions and multiples of a day. It is in this form that the Alfonsine tables circulated in Western Europe for the next three centuries.\n\nAfter translation and Canons were added to the Alfonsine Tables, they were disseminated from Paris to the rest of medieval Europe. As they were received the tables were converted to the local meridians for proper use. Although widely used, a published print version of the tables and John of Saxony's Canons didn't exist. It wasn't until 1483 when Erhard Ratdolt in Venice published both. To date neither John of Ligneres and Johannes de Muris cannons were published in print.\n"}

Display ads are generally used by businesses and corporations towards promotion of their goods and services and are generally for larger budget clients.\n\nNewspaper display ads are different from the regular \"display ads\" terminology, which is commonly referred to as advertisements placed on the internet in banner and other rich media format.\n\nThese ads can span across multiple columns - and can even cover full page, half page, quarter page or other custom sizes. They are designed in high resolution coloured and black/white formats providing higher visibility for the mass audiences of newspapers. For many major newspapers in developing markets, display ads play a significant role in subsidizing the cost of the published newspaper.\n\nDisplay ads appear in all sections of the newspaper except the editorial page, obituary page, and classified section.\n\nDisplay ads typically contain text, photographs,logos, maps, and other informational items. In a newspaper, display advertising appears on the same page as, or on the page adjacent to general editorial content. Whereas, classified ads generally appears in distinct sections - based on their ad category in a designated newspaper classified pullout. The classified pages were traditionally text-only, and available in a limited selection of typefaces. Classified ads can either be normal classified texts or classified display ads. Classified display ads are cheaper than regular display ads - and appear in smaller width sizes in the classified columns. Display Ads are generally 6-7 times more expensive than classified display advertisements.\n\nTypically, newspaper display ads are used by larger business establishments with larger advertising budgets. Display ads include retail/branding, public announcements, tender, public notice, education admission notices, UFR, special appointment supplements etc. For personal/individual requirements such as selling property, selling automobiles, or change of name, newspaper classified ads are more optimally suited.\n\nDisplay ads charges are usually based on the amount of area they consume and are quoted in per sq. cm or per column cm . Each column width of the publication might vary on basis of a broadsheet or a pullout, however in general stands at 4 cm width.\n\nNowadays, most newspapers and magazines have converted to a \"modular\" system that simplifies ad size and eliminates the need to figure out column inches. In a modular system ad sizes are represented by the amount of the total page the ad takes up. For example 1/2 page, 1/4 page, 1/8 page, etc. This has been a popular system among many newspapers because it simplifies the layout process (i.e. less ad sizes to fit in newspaper) and makes pricing much easier for an advertiser to understand.\n"}
{"id": "7826295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7826295", "title": "Nisus and Euryalus", "text": "Nisus and Euryalus\n\nNisus and Euryalus are a pair of friends and lovers serving under Aeneas in the \"Aeneid\", the Augustan epic by Virgil. Their foray among the enemy, narrated in Book nine, demonstrates their stealth and prowess as warriors, but ends as a tragedy: the loot Euryalus acquires (a glistening Rutulian helmet) attracts attention, and the two die together. Virgil presents their deaths as a loss of admirable loyalty and valor. They also appear in Book 5, during the funeral games of Anchises, where Virgil takes note of their \"amor pius\", a love that exhibits the \"pietas\" that is Aeneas's own distinguishing virtue.\n\nIn describing the bonds of devotion between the two men, Virgil draws on conventions of erotic poetry that have suggested a romantic relationship to some, interpreted by scholars in light of the Greek custom of \"paiderastia\".\n\nNisus and Euryalus are among the refugees who in the aftermath of the Trojan War flee under the leadership of Aeneas, the highest-ranking Trojan to survive. Nisus was the son of Hyrtacus, and was known for his hunting. The family cultivated the huntress-goddess who inhabited Mount Ida. Euryalus, who was younger, has spent his entire life in a state of war and displacement. He was trained as a fighter by his battle-hardened father, Opheltes, of whom he speaks with pride. Opheltes seems to have died at Troy.\n\nAfter their wanderings around the Mediterranean, the Trojans are fated to land on the shores of Italy. Some members of their party, especially the \"matres\" (\"mothers\"), are settled at Sicily before the Italian war, but the mother of Euryalus refused to be parted from her son and continued on.\n\nAlthough Nisus and Euryalus are inseparable as a pair in the narrative, each is given a distinct characterization. Nisus is the elder, more experienced man. He is swift and accurate \"(acerrimus)\" in the use of projectile weapons, the javelin \"(iaculum)\" and arrows.\n\nEuryalus is still young, with the face of a boy (\"puer\") who hasn't started shaving, just old enough to bear arms. He was more beautiful \"(pulchrior)\" than any other of Aeneas's men at arms. Euryalus maintains a loving relationship with his mother. He refuses to see her before he leaves on his mission, because he cannot bear her inevitable tears, and yet his first concern amid promises of rich rewards is that she be cared for if he fails to return.\n\nThe foray by Nisus and Euryalus is a well-developed, self-contained episode that occurs in the \"Iliadic\" half of the \"Aeneid\", set during the war through which the displaced Trojans established themselves among the inhabitants of central Italy. Virgil introduces the characters anew, but they have already appeared in Book 5, at the funeral games held for Aeneas’s father, Anchises, during the \"Odyssean\" first half of the epic. The games demonstrate behaviors that in the war to come will result in victory or defeat; in particular, the footrace in which Nisus and Euryalus compete prefigures their disastrous mission.\n\nThe five runners are, in the order in which they would have finished, Nisus, Salius, Euryalus, Elymus, and Diores. Nisus, however, slips in the blood from the cattle sacrificed during the religious rituals that preceded the race. Recognizing that he can't recover his lead, he trips Salius to hand the victory to Euryalus. Nisus shows himself willing to sacrifice his own honor in order to help Euryalus, but the gesture demonstrates not only his loyalty but a willingness to cheat. Salius objects to the foul, and is given a consolation prize. Nisus receives compensation for his bad luck, and Euryalus gets the winner's prize. The incident is treated as comic, but becomes ominous in light of what happens to the pair later.\n\nAlthough the night raid of Nisus and Euryalus has a discrete narrative unity, it is closely related to major themes of the epic, such as the transition from boyhood to manhood, also present in the characters of Ascanius, Pallas, and Lausus, and the waste of young lives in war. Nisus and Euryalus's killing spree through the camp of the Rutuli is one of Virgil's most brutal descriptions of combat (especially when Nisus beheads the chief Remus with his warriors Lamyrus, Lamus and Serranus). The poetry of Euryalus's death—\"as when a richly hued flower is cut down by the plough and withers as it dies, or when the rains beat down the poppy's head, weighed down on slack neck\" — is a replay of the death of Gorgytion in the Iliad.\n\nIn portraying the \"amor\" of Nisus and Euryalus, Virgil draws on a Greek model of love between men. In the Roman military, homosexual behavior among fellow soldiers was harshly prohibited, in keeping with Roman values that defined a citizen's political liberty in part by freedom from physical compulsion, including sexual use. Among the Greeks, however, there was a long tradition of idealized homosexuality in a military setting. Although the relationship between Nisus and Euryalus initially conforms to the Greek model of the \"erastes\" and \"eromenos\", their shared military exploits transform them into solidly Roman \"viri\", \"men.\" By describing their love as \"pius\", Virgil endorses it as \"honorable, dignified and connected to central Roman values.\" The elevated decorum of the \"Aeneid\" excludes explicit sexuality in general.\n\n"}

It shows the settlements and landmarks of the Kingdom of Hungary in the early 16th century. The southern areas occupied by the Ottoman Empire are marked with different colors.

It is widespread throughout Europe.\n\nIt has obvious parallels to Rumpelstiltskin and Frau Holle, and obvious differences, so that they are often compared.\n\nGiambattista Basile includes an Italian literary fairy tale, The Seven Little Pork Rinds, in his 1634 work, the Pentamerone\".\n\nItalo Calvino's \"Italian Folktales\" includes a variant, \"And Seven!\".\n\nThe first edition of \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\" contained a much shorter variant, Hateful Flax Spinning, but it is \"The Three Spinners\" that became well-known.\n\nOnce there was a beautiful-but-lazy girl who would not spin. While her mother beats her for it, the Queen, passing by, overhears and asks the reason for the punishment. Ashamed to admit that her daughter is lazy, the woman replies that the girl spins so much that her mother cannot afford to buy enough flax to keep her occupied. The Queen, impressed by such industry, offers to take the girl with her.\n\nOnce at the castle, the queen takes the girl to a room filled with flax. If she spins it all within three days, she'll be rewarded with marriage to the queen's oldest son. Two days later, the queen returns and is amazed to find the flax untouched. The girl pleads that homesickness has kept her from spinning, but she realizes that excuse will not serve her twice.\n\nThree women appear in the room that night. One has a grotesquely swollen foot; the second, an overgrown thumb; the third, a pendulous lip. They offer to spin all the flax for the girl if she will invite them to her wedding, introduce them as her aunts, and seat them at the high table. She agrees, and they commence and complete the spinning.\n\nIn the morning, the queen is satisfied to see the flax all spun. She arranges for the wedding to her son, the prince, and the girl asks to invite her \"aunts\". When they appear, the king asks how they came to have such deformities, and the three explain that they come from their years of spinning. The king forbids his beautiful daughter-in-law to spin again.\n\nA king orders his queen and daughters to spin all the time. One day, he gives them a great box of flax to spin, to his daughters' distress. The queen invites three hideous old maids to come to the castle and spin. The king sees them and asks the cause of their deformities. Their answer: from spinning. The king forbids his wife and daughters to spin again.\n\nA girl eats seven pieces of bacon, leaving none for her mother. While the mother beats her for her gluttony, a passing merchant asks the reason, and the woman replies that her daughter is ruining her health by working too hard. The merchant decides on the spot to marry this industrious girl.\n\nThe now-married merchant goes on a journey, leaving his wife the spinning. Making an effort to spin, she flicks a passersby with water; some passing fairies are so amused by this that they offer to do the spinning for her. Despite their aid, the merchant's wife claims that the spinning has made her ill, and the merchant decides not to require her to spin any more, as her mother must have been right about her overworking.\n\nIn this version, as in the one just described, the part of the king is taken by a merchant; similarly, the mother berates her daughter for \"seven\" – meaning seven bowls of soup that the girl has eaten – but the mother pretends that they are spindles of hemp that the girl has spun.\n\nThe women helpers in this version – who also are deformed from their years of spinning – instruct the girl to invite them to her wedding by calling their names. If she does not do so, they warn her, she will be worse off than she would have been had they not spun for her. She forgets the names and puts off the wedding while she tries to recall them. The merchant sees the three women cavorting in the forest and hears them call out their names, similar to the scene in Rumpelstiltskin; he describes this to his bride in hopes of amusing her and getting her to agree to a wedding date. She is therefore able to invite her helpers and bring about the happy ending as in \"The Three Spinners\".\n\nA Puerto Rican version exists, with three Holy Souls in Purgatory replacing the fairies, and a merchant in place of the king. The heroine in this version is an orphan abused by an aunt.\n\n\n"}

In the political violence of the 1970s, TİT gained notoriety during political clashes and is believed to be responsible for over 1,000 deaths during this period. After the military coup of 1980, most of its members were arrested but later released and assisted Turkish military intelligence in operations against Kurdish militants.\n\nIn 1979, police arrested a man named Cengiz Ayhan in Mersin on charges of being the leader of the Turkish Revenge Brigade.

{"id": "2232740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2232740", "title": "Vergilius Chapel", "text": "Vergilius Chapel\n\nThe Vergilius Chapel () is an underground crypt next to the Stephansdom in Vienna. It is rectangular in form (approximately 6 meters by 10), with six niches. Today, it lies approximately 12 meters beneath the Stephansplatz.\n\nThe history of the chapel is not entirely clear. The architecture can be dated to the early 13th century. At this time, Frederick the Warlike (1230-1246), the last Duke of the House of Babenberg, was the ruler of Vienna. It has been hypothesized that the Duke, who would have liked to have established Vienna as an episcopal see, had the crypt built for St. Coloman of Stockerau, who was to be the patron of the new diocese. However, the chronicles do not mention the chapel, which has given rise to the speculation that it is the remnant of a failed project.\n\nIn the year 1307, a burial chapel of the Viennese family Chrannest is mentioned. The chapel was said to have multiple altars, one of which was dedicated to St. Vergilius of Salzburg.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Stephansdom was encircled by a large cemetery. A single small chapel, dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene (the \"Magdalenskapelle\" or Magdalene Chapel), existed for consecrations and requiem masses. The Virgilius Chapel lay directly underneath this chapel, and a vertical shaft connected the two buildings.\n\nIn 1782, the cemetery around the Stephansdom was closed. The Magdalene Chapel was destroyed by fire in 1781 and was not rebuilt (presumably as, without a cemetery, there was no need for a funeral chapel). The Virgilius Chapel was filled with rubble and faded into obscurity.\n\nIn 1973 the chapel was rediscovered during construction of the Vienna U-Bahn. Today there is a mosaic on the Stephansplatz showing the outlines of the Virgilius Chapel. The chapel itself has survived with hardly any damage and provides the visitor with an excellent glance into the world of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Virgilius Chapel may be entered directly from the Stephansplatz U-Bahn Station. It is possible to look into the chapel from above. A collection of historical ceramics has been installed at the entrance to the chapel itself.\n\n"}

It is in the basement of the south wing of the Pergamon Museum and has one of the world's largest collections of Southwest Asian art. 14 halls distributed across 2,000 square meters of exhibition surface display southwest Asian culture spanning six millennia. The exhibits cover a period from the 6th millennium BCE into the time of the Muslim conquests. They originate particularly from today's states of Iraq, Syria and Turkey, with singular finds also from other areas. Starting with the Neolithic finds, the emphasis of the collection is of finds from Sumer, Babylonia and Assyria, as well as northern Syria and eastern Anatolia.\n\nExcavations in historically important cities like Uruk, Shuruppak, Assur, Hattusha, Tell el Amarna, Tell Halaf (Guzana), Sam'al, Toprakkale and Babylon built the foundation of the museum's collection. Further acquisitions came from Nimrud, Nineveh, Susa and Persepolis. The museum shows finds from the cultures of Sumer, Akkad, Babylonia, Assyria, the Hittites and the Aramaeans. These finds often found their way to Berlin via the German Oriental Society. In 1899, the Middle East Department at the royal museums was created. In 1929, they were provisionally accommodated in the Bode Museum and the Pergamon Museum, where they have been accessible to the public since 1930. During the Second World War, there were hardly any war-related losses. The mobile exhibits, which were taken as art spoliage to the Soviet Union, were returned to East Germany in 1958. The collection had already opened again as the \"Vorderasiatisches Museum\" in 1953.\n\nNotable pieces of the collection are the Ishtar Gate and Procession Way of Babylon, remainders of the ancient city of Babylon, parts of the Eanna temple and Karaindash's temple to Inanna in Uruk. The museum also has an important number of Southwest Asian stamp and cylinder seals, as well as cuneiform texts. It has more than 200 of the Amarna letters and the larger (\"Meissner\") fragment (\"VAT 4105\") of the Sippar tablet from the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", which includes Siduri's advice, unlike later editions of the epic.\n\nAt present Markus Hilgert is the director of the museum.

{"id": "33323575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33323575", "title": "White Tower (Tower of London)", "text": "White Tower (Tower of London)\n\nThe White Tower is a central tower, the old keep, at the Tower of London. It was built by William the Conqueror during the early 1080s, and subsequently extended. The White Tower was the castle's strongest point militarily, and provided accommodation for the king and his representatives, as well as a chapel. Henry III ordered that the tower be whitewashed in 1240.\n\nThe castle which later became known as the Tower of London was begun by William the Conqueror in 1066. It began as a timber fortification enclosed by a palisade. In the next decade work began on the White Tower, the great stone keep that still dominates the castle today. The precise date of the White Tower's foundation is unknown, and it is also uncertain how long building took. It is traditionally held that construction began in 1078. This is because the \"Textus Roffensis\" records that Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, oversaw the building work under instruction from William the Conqueror. Dendrochronological evidence suggests construction of the White Tower began in 1075–1079. The archaeology of the standing building suggests there was a pause in construction between 1080 and 1090–1093, although it is unknown why. Gundulf did more than just oversee work and was a skilled architect. Rochester's castle and cathedral were rebuilt under his auspices. As the main castle in England's capital, the Tower of London was an important royal building. The keep built by Gundulf bears testament to this as it was one of the largest in Christendom.\n\nThe White Tower was multi-purpose. It was the castle's strongest point militarily yet provided accommodation fit for the king and his representatives. In Norman architecture the keep was a symbol of a lord's power. The White Tower was probably complete by 1100 at the latest, at which point it was used to imprison Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham. It was probably during Henry II's reign (1154–1189) that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance, but it has not survived. Henry III's relations with his barons were uneasy, and in the 1220s and 1230s he enhanced the castle's defences and domestic buildings. Though the work he started may not have been finished within his lifetime, he extended the castle to the north and east, building a new stone wall to enclose the castle. A brattice (a timber gallery) was added to the top of the White Tower, projecting beyond its walls to better defend the base of the tower. Henry also undertook maintenance of the White Tower and it was during his reign that the tradition of whitewashing the building began. In March 1240 the Keeper of the Works at the Tower of London was ordered \"to have the Great Tower whitened both inside and out\". Later that year the king wrote to the Keeper, commanding that the White Tower's lead guttering should be extended with the effect that \"the wall of the tower ... newly whitened, may be in no danger of perishing or falling outwards through the trickling of the rain\". Henry did not explain his order to whitewash the keep, but may have been influenced by contemporary fashion in Europe to paint prestigious buildings white. He also added decoration to the chapel in the keep, adding stained glass, statues, and paintings.\nActivity at the castle in the early 14th century declined relative to previous periods. Though the Tower of London was still occasionally used as a residence, by the 1320s the chapel in the White Tower was used to store records. This marked the beginning of the castle's diminishing role as a royal residence. The records were briefly removed from the White Tower in 1360 to accommodate the captive French king, John II. It may have been during the reign of Edward III (1327–1377) that a building abutting the south side of the White Tower was created. Built as storage, it may have been part of Edward's building programme at the Tower of London which saw its role as a military store come to the fore. The structure no longer survives, but is recorded on plans from 1597 and 1717.\n\nRichard II was imprisoned at the Tower of London and abdicated there in 1399; according to tradition, the event took place in the White Tower. In the 1490s a new floor was added to the White Tower, creating extra storage. Architecturally virtually no trace remains of the White Tower's forebuilding, although it appears in a manuscript drawing circa 1500 depicting the imprisonment of Charles, Duke of Orléans and was recorded in a plan of 1597. It was demolished in 1674. On 17 June that year, during the course of the demolition, bones belonging to two children were discovered beneath the stairs in the forebuilding. It was assumed that they belonged to the Princes in the Tower. The remains were re-interred in Westminster Abbey. The story of the Princes in the Tower is one of the most infamous stories related to the castle. After the death of Edward IV his 12-year-old son was declared king as Edward V, but never crowned. Richard Duke of Gloucester was named Lord Protector while the prince was too young to rule. Edward was confined to the Tower of London along with his younger brother, Richard of Shrewsbury. The Duke of Gloucester was then proclaimed King Richard III in July. The princes had last been seen in public in June 1483; the most likely reason for their disappearance is that they were murdered late in the summer of 1483.\n\nBy the Tudor period, the science of fortification had changed to deal with powerful cannons. The new designs, with low angled bastions, were not emulated at the Tower of London. All the same, some adaptations to use cannon were made; the changes included adding a timber platform to the top of the White Tower for cannon emplacements. The weight of the guns damaged the roof so that it had to be reinforced. The one documented use of these cannon was during Wyatt's rebellion in 1554 and they were ineffective. The Office of Ordnance and Office of Armoury were headquartered at the Tower of London until the 17th century. Their presence influenced activity at the castle and led to it becoming the country's most important military store. In the 1560s two armouries were created in the White Tower and by the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) most of the gunpowder at the Tower was stored in the White Tower. By the last quarter of the 16th century the castle was a tourist attraction with visitors allowed inside despite its use by the Offices of Ordnance and Armoury. Its role in providing storage directly impacted on the White Tower's structure and posts were added to support the floors. In 1636 a hole was knocked through the White Tower's north wall to ease the movement of provisions. In 1639–1640 the White Tower's external appearance was changed, with much of its facing material replaced.\n\nIn 1640 Charles I ordered that the Tower of London should be prepared for conflict. Platforms for cannons were built and 21 installed on top of the White Tower with three additional mortars. Despite the new defences the Parliamentarians captured the Tower of London without the cannon being used. In January 1642, Charles I attempted to arrest five Members of Parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir John Byron, the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir John Conyers. By the time the English Civil War broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament's control. By 1657 the entire building apart from the chapel was being used to store gunpowder. Storing both gunpowder and government records in the White Tower was not ideal, and there were repeated suggestions in 1620, 1718, and 1832 to move the gunpowder to a new location, although the proposals were unsuccessful.\nBy 1661 plans had been proposed to clear an area around the White Tower to safeguard the dangerous material inside. Nothing was done until after the Great Fire of London in 1666. During the fire it was feared the flames might reach the castle, specifically the White Tower, highlighting the need for safety measures. In the following years a protective wall was built around the White Tower. In the 1670s buildings that had accumulated around the White Tower to provide storage for the Offices of Ordnance and Armoury were pulled down. After this, repairs were carried out on the face of the White Tower. A staircase was also added on the south face, allowing direct access to the records in the chapel.\n\nWhile the Tower of London had been open to visitors for centuries, it was not until the early 19th century that alterations were made explicitly for visitors. In 1825 a building, the New Horse Armoury, to contain effigies of England's kings was constructed against the south of the White Tower. The Gothic revival design of the structure – one of the first purpose-built museums in England – was widely reviled. By the end of the century the effigies and Queen Elizabeth's Armoury were distributed in displays in the White Tower. In the mid-19th century, under the encouragement of Prince Albert, Anthony Salvin undertook a programme of restoration at the castle. In 1858 the White Tower's roof was reinforced with iron girders. On 26 January 1885 a bomb in the White Tower damaged some of the displays.\n\nThe roofs of the White Tower and its turrets were repaired in the 1960s and 1970s. Accumulated dirt was washed from the exterior and the floors inside replaced. Also in this period a staircase was added against the south face of the keep, reopening access through the original entrance. In 1974, there was a bomb explosion in the Mortar Room in the White Tower, leaving one person dead and 35 injured. No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but the police investigated suspicions that the IRA was behind it. In 1988, the Tower of London as a whole was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. The Tower of London is in the care of Historic Royal Palaces, a charity, and between 2008 and 2011 a £2 million conservation programme was undertaken at the White Tower. Repairs were carried out and the keep was cleaned, removing pollution that was causing damage to the structure. The White Tower is a Grade I listed building, and recognised as an internationally important structure. The Royal Armouries still have displays at the White Tower.\n\nThe White Tower is a keep (also known as a donjon), which was often the strongest structure in a medieval castle, and contained lodgings suitable for the lord—in this case the king or his representative. According to military historian Allen Brown, \"The great tower [White Tower] was also, by virtue of its strength, majesty and lordly accommodation, the donjon \"par excellence\"\". One of the largest keeps in the Christian world, the White Tower has been described as \"the most complete eleventh-century palace in Europe\". The influences on the White Tower's design are unclear. Magnates in northern France had been building stone keeps since the mid-9th century so the general design was well-established. More specifically the keep of Château d'Ivry-la-Bataille, built around 1000, may have been a particularly prominent influence as it included a semi-circular projection in one corner. Allen Brown and P. Curnow suggested that the design may have been based on the now vanished 10th-century keep of Château de Rouen, which belonged to the Dukes of Normandy.\n\nAt the western corners are square towers, while to the north-east a round tower houses a spiral staircase. At the south-east corner is a larger semi-circular projection which accommodates the apse of the chapel. Excluding its projecting corner towers, the keep measures at the base, and rises to a height of and is high at the southern battlements where the ground is lower. The structure was originally three storeys high, comprising a basement floor, an entrance level, and an upper floor. The entrance, as is usual in Norman keeps, was above ground (in this case on the south face) and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack. The forebuilding added in the 12th century no longer survives. As the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold, latrines were built into the walls, and four fireplaces provided warmth.\n\nThe main building material is Kentish rag-stone, though some local mudstone was also used. Although little of it survives, Caen stone was imported from northern France to provide details in the Tower's facing, much of it replaced by Portland stone in the 17th and 18th centuries under the direction of architect Inigo Jones. As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18th century, only two original – albeit restored – examples remain, in the south wall at gallery level. The White Tower was terraced into the side of a mound, so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level.\n\nThe purpose of each room is interpreted based primarily on its design. As a result, there can be some ambiguity in what individual chambers were used for. Each floor was divided into three chambers, the largest in the west, a smaller room in the north-east, and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south-east. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th century when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits. The sole access to the floor was via the north-east staircase turret.\n\nThe entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the Constable of the Tower and other important officials. The south entrance was blocked during the 17th century, and not reopened until 1973. Those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east, also connected to the entrance floor. The crypt of St John's Chapel occupied the south-east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber. There is a recess in the north wall of the crypt; according to Geoffrey Parnell, Keeper of the Tower History at the Royal Armouries, \"the windowless form and restricted access, suggest that it was designed as a strong-room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents\".\n\nThe upper floor contained a grand hall in the west and residential chamber in the eastboth originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the walland St John's Chapel in the south-east. The top floor was added in the 15th century, along with the present roof. The absence of domestic amenities such as fireplaces suggest it was intended for use as storage rather than accommodation. In the 17th century lead cisterns were installed on top of the White Tower.\n\nThe semi-circular projection in the south-east corner to accommodate St John's Chapel is almost unparalleled in castle architecture. The only other keep in England with a similar projection is that of Colchester Castle, the largest in England. St John's Chapel was not part of the White Tower's original design, as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls. Due to changes in function and design since the tower's construction, except for the chapel little is left of the original interior. The chapel's current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the Norman period. In the 13th century, during Henry III's reign, the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold-painted cross, and stained glass windows that depicted the Virgin Mary and Holy Trinity.\n\n\n"}

He went into exile with his mother, Mihrengiz Kadın, who had been the wife of Sultan Mehmed V, and with his two young children, Mahmud Namık and Emine Mükbile. Like all other members of the Imperial family, they left Istanbul from Sirkeci Train Station and first went to Budapest. They lived here for a few months, then moved to Vienna, then Paris, before settling in Nice, France. As the former Ottoman Sultan, Sultan Mehmed VI, had settled in San Remo, many members of the family had congregated in the South of France. After living in Switzerland for a short time, his cousin, the last Caliph of Islam Prince Abdulmecid, also moved to Nice. Ömer Hilmi spent the next 11 years of his life in Nice, struggling to adapt to life in exile, before moving to Alexandria, Egypt in January 1935 with his family. Life in exile was always very difficult since members of the Imperial Ottoman family had no financial means, and all yearned to return to their homeland.\n\nHis daughter, Emine Mükbile, who had married her distant cousin Ali Vasib in 1931, cared for him, her grandmother and brother during all this time. Ömer Hilmi suffered from a stroke and died soon after settling in Alexandria. He died aged 49 at Alexandria, on 6 April 1935, and was buried in Khedive Tawfik Mausoleum, Cairo, Egypt.\n\n\nShowing the line of descent from the founder of the Ottoman dynasty to present day through Sultan Mehmed V Reşad's youngest son Prince Ömer Hilmi Efendi\n\n"}
