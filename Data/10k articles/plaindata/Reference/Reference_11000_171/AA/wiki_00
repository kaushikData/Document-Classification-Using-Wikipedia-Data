{"id": "2166202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2166202", "title": "A Latin Dictionary", "text": "A Latin Dictionary\n\nA Latin Dictionary (or Harpers' Latin Dictionary, often referred to as Lewis and Short or L&S) is a popular English-language lexicographical work of the Latin language, published by Harper and Brothers of New York in 1879 and printed simultaneously in the United Kingdom by Oxford University Press.\n\nThe work is usually referred to as Lewis and Short after the names of its editors, Charlton T. Lewis and Charles Short. It was derived from the 1850 English translation by Ethan Allen Andrews of an earlier Latin-German dictionary, \"Wörterbuch der Lateinischen Sprache\", by the German philologist Wilhelm Freund, in turn based on I.J.G. Scheller’s Latin–German dictionary of 1783. The Andrews translation was partially revised by Freund himself, then by Henry Drisler, and was finally edited by Short and Lewis.\n\nThe division of labour between the two editors was remarkably unequal. Short, a very thorough but slow worker, produced material for the letters A through C, but B and C were lost by Harpers, meaning that his work now only appears in the letter A (216 pages), while Lewis, who worked in the time he could spare from his law practice, was solely responsible for the entries beginning with the letters B through Z (1803 pages). In 1890 Lewis published a heavily abridged version the dictionary, entitled \"An Elementary Latin Dictionary,\" for the use of students. Sometimes called the \"Elementary Lewis,\" it is still in print today.\n\nThe adoption of the book by Oxford University Press was the result of the failure of its own project to create a new Latin-English dictionary in 1875. Henry Nettleship and John Mayor had been commissioned to produce a new Latin dictionary based on a fresh reading of the sources, but after Mayor withdrew from the project, Nettleship was unable to complete it on his own; he eventually published his research as notes on Lewis and Short. While the Press had earlier published John Riddle’s 1835 translation of Scheller’s Latin–German dictionary, this was a much more expensive book. The Press thus adopted \"Harpers' Latin Dictionary\" as a stopgap measure, paying Harper and Brothers 10 per cent royalties. Harper and Brothers sold its rights to the American Book Company in 1899, shortly before its bankruptcy.\n\nFrom the time of its publication, many scholars have criticized the dictionary for its errors and inconsistencies. Because of various circumstances, however, no replacement was attempted until 1933, with the \"Oxford Latin Dictionary\", which was completed in 1983.\n\nThe dictionary's full text is available on-line from the Perseus Project. Lewis and Short is also available for offline consultation, by means of various applications.\n\nAmong classicists, Lewis and Short has been largely superseded by the \"Oxford Latin Dictionary\", called the OLD for short. Lewis and Short incorporated material from existing Latin dictionaries; the \"OLD\", by contrast, started from scratch, following procedures similar to those of the well-regarded \"Oxford English Dictionary\". Thanks to the increased availability of modern editions, the \"OLD\" editors had access to a larger variety of classical works. Although classicists still consult Lewis and Short, they tend to prefer the \"OLD\".\n\nOn the other hand, Lewis and Short remains a standard reference work for medievalists, renaissance specialists, and early modernists, as the dictionary covers Late and Medieval Latin, if somewhat inconsistently. The \"OLD\", when used on its own, rarely meets their needs, since it was decided early in the \"OLD\"'s planning that the work would not encompass works written later than AD 200. A few exceptions were made for especially important texts from the late classical period, such as Augustine's \"De Civitate Dei\", but for periods later than that the \"OLD\" is considerably less useful. The \"Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources\" supplements the \"OLD\" for medieval usage of Latin words.\n\nIn cases where Lewis and Short do not answer a medieval usage question, J. F. Niermeyer's \"Mediae Latinitatis Lexicon Minus\" often supplies an answer. The \"Lexicon Minus\" was completed in 1976 by C. van de Kieft after Niermeyer's death, and has since become a standard reference work. More recent editions of the \"Lexicon Minus\" have corrections and expansions; also, in later editions all words are defined in English, French and German, making it of greater international importance than Lewis and Short. The \"Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae latinitatis\" completed in 1678 by Charles du Fresne (commonly referred to as Du Cange after the author's title, the \"Sieur du Cange\") is now less frequently used, as Niermeyer's \"Lexicon Minus\" incorporates much of its information.\n\nOn occasion people confuse Lewis and Short (or L&S) with Liddell and Scott, its Greek counterpart, entitled \"A Greek–English Lexicon\". The 1945 and later editions of Liddell and Scott are commonly referred to by the abbreviation LSJ after the names of its editors Liddell, Scott and the editor of the 1945 revision, Jones.\n\n\n"}

Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair. \"The Daily Mirror\" published a story on its front page on 22 November 2005 that said the memo quotes Bush speculating about a U.S. bombing raid on Al Jazeera's world headquarters in the Qatari capital Doha and other locations. The story said that Blair persuaded Bush to take no action.\n\nThe five-page memorandum is said by the \"Mirror\" to be a record of the meeting between the two leaders which took place on 16 April 2004 at the height of Operation Vigilant Resolve, an assault on Fallujah by U.S. Marines and Iraqi security forces. Al Jazeera reporters were in the city providing video footage of the conflict. The day before the meeting, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld described Al Jazeera's coverage as \"vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable.\" Al Jazeera reporters defended their live broadcasts of the civilian casualties by stating \"the pictures do not lie\".\n\nThe White House has dismissed the allegations made in the article.\nGiven that Qatar is an ally of the United States and the United Kingdom in the Iraq War, many commentators have speculated that even if the reports of the memorandum are accurate, they may simply be recording a statement which the President did not intend to be taken seriously. A White House official told CNN \"We are not going to dignify something so outlandish with a response,\" and a Pentagon official called the \"Daily Mirror\" report \"absolutely absurd.\"\nA BBC News correspondent has suggested that if President Bush did indeed make the comments they were intended as \"some kind of joke.\"\n\nWriting in \"The Independent\" on 28 November Andreas Whittam Smith countered, observing that \"official note takers don't normally record jokes\". He also pointed to the alleged leaker's \"25 years' experience of tough postings in place such as Islamabad and Khartoum, ... often involved in intelligence work\" and concluded that he \"must have felt exceptionally troubled by what he was seeing.\"\n\nAccording to a report in \"The Daily Telegraph\":\nThe report also stated that, when questioned about the matter at the Commonwealth conference in Malta, Blair branded the claims a \"conspiracy theory.\"\n\nDavid Keogh, a civil servant at the Cabinet Office, and Leo O'Connor, a research assistant to former Labour MP Tony Clarke, were charged under the Official Secrets Act 1989 for the unauthorised disclosure of the memo (Keogh under section three, O'Connor under section five). When O'Connor gave the memo to Clarke, Clarke returned it to Downing Street. All news organisations in the United Kingdom have been warned by Attorney General Lord Goldsmith against further publication of information from the leaked memo; Goldsmith has mentioned the possibility of prosecution under section five of the Official Secrets Act 1989 if published details from the memorandum are considered to damage interests of the United Kingdom abroad. On 29 November 2005, Keogh and O'Connor appeared at Bow Street Magistrates Court in Central London. Following a 15-minute hearing the case was adjourned until 10 January 2006. (CNN) On 10 May 2007, Keogh was found guilty on two counts of making a \"damaging disclosure\" by revealing the memo and was sentenced to 6 months in jail. He was also ordered to pay £5,000 in costs to the prosecution. O'Connor was sentenced to 3 months in jail. (Reuters)\n\nBoris Johnson, the Conservative MP for Henley, editor of \"The Spectator\" and a supporter of the war, has stated that he will publish the memorandum if he receives a copy of it in the hope it will put speculation about what Bush may or may not have actually said to rest.\nIan Hislop, editor of \"Private Eye\", made a similar promise in an exchange with Johnson on the television show \"Have I Got News For You\" (broadcast on 25 November, but recorded the previous day).\n\nThe trial judge in 2005 made an order under Section 11 of the Contempt Of Court Act 1981, banning in perpetuity any connection in the UK media between the trial and Al Jazeera. \"Any journalist will have to ensure in his own mind that they are not making an impermissible link\", he said. There have been no U.K. reports linking the trial and remarks by David Blunkett on Channel 4 stating that \"taking out\" Al-Jazeera was discussed in a conversation with Tony Blair at the start of the Iraq war. Reporters Without Borders has condemned the ban .\n\nIn an appeal against the ban, lodged by a group of UK Media companies, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips partly lifted the ban. The UK media will now be able to repeat previously published allegations, but it will still be illegal to suggest that these allegations accurately represented evidence given in secret during the trial. It will also be illegal to print a particular phrase uttered in open court by Keogh when he was asked about the document. \n\nAl Jazeera's offices have previously been hit by United States weaponry. On 13 November 2001 a U.S. missile hit Al Jazeera's office in Kabul, Afghanistan, during the U.S. invasion of that country. Although no Al Jazeera staff were hurt in the attack, the building was destroyed and some employees' homes were damaged. At the time, Mohammed Jasim al-Ali, managing editor, said that the coordinates of the office were well known to everyone including the Americans.\n\nWhen former British Home Secretary David Blunkett published his memoirs in late 2006, it was revealed he had advised Prime Minister Tony Blair in late March 2003 to bomb the Al Jazeera television transmitter in Baghdad. \"There wasn't a worry from me because I believed that this was a war and in a war you wouldn't allow the broadcast to continue taking place\", Blunkett said.\n\nOn 8 April 2003 a U.S. missile hit an electricity generator at Al Jazeera's office in Baghdad. The resulting fire killed reporter Tareq Ayyoub and wounded another staff member.\nOn 24 February, Mohammed Jasim al-Ali had sent a letter with the coordinates of the offices to Victoria Clarke, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (the location had not been officially requested by the U.S. government). This incident, which occurred during the U.S. assault on Baghdad and after criticism of Al Jazeera's coverage from those supportive of the war aims of the United States forces, gave rise to suspicions that the network had been targeted.\n\nFrank Gaffney published an opinion piece on 29 September 2003 calling for Al Jazeera to be \"taken down\" \"one way or another\" because it constitutes \"enemy media\".\n\n\n"}

This edition contains 145 maps on 77 plates, arranged in 4 parts.\nManuel Francisco de Barros e Sousa de Mesquita de Macedo Leitão e Carvalhosa, second Viscount of Santarém, was born in Lisbon on November 18, 1791, the son of a prominent Portuguese nobleman. A staunch supporter of the monarchy he was, while still young, appointed Guarda-Mor (state archivist) of the royal archives at the Torre do Tombo in Lisbon, and in 1827 even became Minister of the Interior and of Marine and Overseas Territories; he was to hold neither post for long. His support of the Miguelist (absolutist) side in the Civil War meant he was relieved from his function as royal archivist in 1833, forced forced into exile, and finally settled down in Paris, from where he never returned to Portugal - although he was later rehabilitated, and in 1842 even restored to his position as Guarda-Mor.\nIn Paris he devoted himself entirely to historical and cartographical studies, focusing on the Age of Discovery and the Portuguese role in it. Numerous publications resulted from this activity, among them first and foremost his 'Essai sur I'Histoire de la Cosmographie et de la Cartographie pendant le Moyen-âge' (1849–1852) and the famous accompanying 'Atlas composé de Mappemondes, de Portulans et de cartes hydrographiques et historiques depuis le VIe jusq’au XVIIe siècle…' \nHe lived for many years in his house in the Rue Blanche 47, where he died from tuberculosis on January 17, 1856. \n\nAs a statesman Santarém may have been anything but a success, but as a man of science he has rendered his country and the science of historical cartography many and important services; it was in fact he who coined the term 'cartography' and who gave historical cartography a sound scientific basis. The constitutional Portuguese government, with whom he - in spite of his Absolutist inclinations - was on very good terms, repeatedly called in his collaboration and his knowledge of the history of cartography and discovery whenever conflicts arose with other powers, regarding Portuguese claims to territories in Africa. The Government even supported financially - although in an insufficient measure - the publication of his works and especially of the 'Atlas', which was beset with many financial problems, and which he, at the end of his life, considered to be far from accomplished. Also his 'Essai' has remained a 'torso': of the six volumes he planned to compile only three were actually published, extending only to the 15th century. This is all the more regretable as a number of the maps and charts in it, which he intended to discuss in the remaining volumes, now figure in the 'Atlas' without any commentary. \nSantarém himself had reported in 1855 that Volume IV was 'all written and ready for the printer'. After his death in early 1856, the Secretary of the Real Academia de Ciências was in 1857 entrusted with the task of seeing Vol. IV through the press and preparing the manuscripts of the remaining volumes for publication, but 'although the man was well-paid during three years for the work expected from him, nothing was published and, still worse, Santarém's original text went astray and could never be found again'[1].\n\nSantarém's best and most detailed biographer is undoubtedly Jordão A. de Freitas[2] whose book, however, is written in Portuguese and therefore rather difficult to access . The same disadvantage applies to the chapter devoted to Santarém by Armando Cortesão in his work on Portuguese cartographers and cartography[3].In the latter's 'History of Portuguese Cartography[3] written in English, however, an excellent account is given of Santarem's life and work[4]. The short biographical note given here is largely based on this text. \n\nIn 1985 a facsimile edition of the third and last edition (1849) of his ‘Atlas’ was published by Rudolf Muller, bookseller and publisher in Amsterdam.\n\nThere is now, available in English, a biographical and bibliographical text about Visconde de Santarém in Dicionário de Historiadores Portugueses (Dictionary of Portuguese Historians), written by Daniel Estudante Protásio, a Portuguese researcher who has studied the life and works of Santarém since 1994 [5].

At that time, the new St Petersburg was described as \"a heap of villages linked together, like some plantation in the West Indies\". The date of its construction is now considered to mark the foundation of the city.\n\nThe design is a combination of an izba, a traditional Russian countryside house typical of the 17th century, and the Tsar's beloved Dutch Baroque, later to evolve into the Petrine Baroque. Peter built similar \"domiki\" elsewhere in Russia - for example, in Voronezh, and Vologda. The wooden cabin in St Petersburg covers only and contains three rooms - living room, bedroom, and study. It has large ornate windows and a high hipped roof of wooden tiles. Inside, the wooden walls were painted with red oil to resemble brick, and the rooms came to be known as the \"red chambers\" (\"krasnyie khoromtsy\"). There are no fires or chimneys, as it was intended to be used only in the warmer summer months. It was occupied by the Tsar between 1703 and 1708, while Peter supervised the construction of the new imperial city and the Peter and Paul Fortress.\nThe cabin was moved to its present location, 6 Petrovskaia Naberezhnaia, in 1711 from its original site on the north bank of the River Neva close to the present Winter Palace. Peter had it encased for its protection within a red brick pavilion in 1723, and ordered that it be preserved for posterity as a memorial to his modesty, and the creation of St Petersburg \"ex nihilo\". Catherine the Great ordered the shelter for the cabin to be renovated in 1784, and the protective brick pavilion was reconstructed by Nicholas I in the 1840s. Nicholas I also had the bedroom converted into a chapel dedicated to Christ the Redeemer, and iron railings were added in 1874.\n\nPeter's \"domiki\" were used to mark significant dates, such as the bicentenary of Peter's birth in 1672. They became a centre of devotion to the tsar, the Russian Orthodox Church, and the Russian motherland (\"rodina\"). An image of the log cabin was included on the Peter the Great Fabergé egg, created in 1903 to celebrate the bicentenary of the founding of St Petersburg. After the Russian Revolution, they became symbols of Russian heroic labour.\n\nA prized national monument, the contents were removed, and the Cabin was boarded up and camouflaged during the Second World War. It was the first St Petersburg museum to reopen in September 1944, after the end of the Siege of Leningrad. Personal and domestic objects owned and used by Peter are still displayed within, and a bust of Peter by Parmen Zabello stands outside. The cabin is open to the public as a branch of the Russian Museum.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n"}

K. Nair, founder of the National Film Archive of India and guardian of Indian cinema.\n\n\"Celluloid Man\" has been screened at 50 film festivals – one of the few Indian films to have been selected for such a high number of festivals. The film has won two National Awards at the 60th National Film Awards, including Best Biographical Film and Best Editing for Irene Dhar Malik. The film was released in India on 3 May 2013 to coincide with the centenary of Indian cinema.\n\nP. K. Nair’s fascination with cinema began as a child and he watched his first few films lying on the white sand floor of a cinema in Trivandrum. He was a collector even then - collecting ticket stubs, lobby cards, even weighing machine tickets sporting pictures of the stars of the day. He grew up to be a great collector of films.\n\n1,700 films were made in India during the silent film era, of which only nine survive thanks to the efforts of Nair. He travelled to remote parts of India to collect and save cans of rare films. The fact that Dadasaheb Phalke is recognized today as the father of Indian cinema is Nair’s doing. He tried to save any film that he could get his hands on, be it world cinema, Hindi popular films or regional Indian cinema. He even took world cinema to the villages of India.\n\nHe has influenced generations of Indian film students especially the Indian New Wave filmmakers such as Mani Kaul, Kumar Shahani, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, Ketan Mehta, Saeed Akhtar Mirza, Jahnu Barua, Girish Kasaravalli, John Abraham (director), Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Kundan Shah.\n\nThe film is woven with interviews of several filmmakers and film personalities who have been influenced directly and indirectly by P. K. Nair, among them Krzysztof Zanussi, Lester James Peries, Vidhu Vinod Chopra, Saeed Akhtar Mirza, Gulzar, Basu Chatterjee, Naseeruddin Shah, Kamal Haasan, Girish Kasaravalli, Jahnu Barua, Jaya Bachchan, Dilip Kumar, Saira Banu, Sitara Devi, Santosh Sivan, Rajkumar Hirani, Shyam Benegal, Mahesh Bhatt, Yash Chopra, Ramesh Sippy, Mrinal Sen and Surama Ghatak.\n\nBesides the interviews, the film has rare footage from early Indian masterpieces like \"Raja Harishchandra\", \"Kaliya Mardan\", \"Gallant Hearts\", \"Marthanda Verma\", \"Jamai Babu\", \"Fearless Nadia\", \"Sant Tukaram\", \"Achut Kanya\", \"Kismat\", \"Chandralekha\" and \"Kalpana\" - all films that were archived and thus saved by Nair.\n\nThe production started at the end of 2010 and the film was completed in June 2012.\n\nThe film has been shot in Warsaw, Colombo, Pune, Nasik, Mumbai, Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Heggodu, Bengaluru and Kolkata, and eleven cinematographers worked on it: Santosh Thundiyil, K. U. Mohanan, Abhik Mukhopadhyay, P. S. Vinod, H. M. Ramachandra, R. V. Ramani, Vikas Sivaraman, Mahesh Aney and Kiran Deohans.\n\nThe film was shot on 16mm film and then converted to 35mm, with an aspect ratio of 1.85: 1.\n\n\"Celluloid Man\" has won two National Awards in India at the 60th National Film Awards for the Best Historical / Biographical Reconstruction and for Best Editing in 2013. It has also won the \"Nestor The Chronicler\" award for the best archival film for \"Celluloid Man\" at the XII Kyiv International Documentary Film Festival 2013, Ukraine.\n\nShivendra Singh was given the Bimal Roy Memorial Emerging Talent Award for his film \"Celluloid Man\" at a ceremony on 18 October 2013\n\nShivendra Singh Dungarpur was awarded the Special Jury Award for Celluloid Man at the 13th edition of the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF) 2014 on February 9, 2014.\n"}

A retired cavalry officer in the Romanian Land Forces, he began writing in his late twenties or early thirties, reaching his fame as a contributor to the Francophone daily \"L'Indépendence Roumaine\". He was widely respected for his verdicts on fashion, and, as an arbiter of taste, contributed to his paper's renown; however, people of his day also ridiculed him for his florid literary style, his political involvement with the Conservative Party, and his apparent homosexuality.\n\nClaymoor's period of prominence, at the height of the \"Belle Époque\", ended with his sudden death. By that time, he had also left a mark as one of Romania's first film critics. Although his almanac was still published, he himself was largely forgotten in the Kingdom of Romania by the end of World War I. Traces of his memory are preserved in disguised portrayals and parodies by writers such as Ion Luca Caragiale and Petru Dumitriu.\n\nVăcărescu's exact birth date remains unknown. However, he died at the age of 60 or 61, meaning that he was born in 1842 or 1843. It also certain that he was of aristocratic upbringing, from the Văcărescu family, and directly related to other prominent families of Wallachian boyars; unlike them, he had inherited little wealth. He was the son of the more famous Wallachian poet Iancu (Ioan) Văcărescu, and as such grandson of Alecu and grandnephew of Ienăchiță Văcărescu. His great-grandfather Ianache Văcărescu had served Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu during the Pruth River Campaign, and had been executed alongside him. Other ancestors of the journalist had been in constant conflict with the Phanariote princes who succeeded Brâncoveanu: Ienăchiță and his brothers were most likely poisoned, while Alecu was imprisoned under false charges.\n\nIancu was also a dissident during the \"Regulamentul Organic\" regime. Arrested for various intervals, he had his land confiscated by Prince Alexandru II Ghica. After Ghica's downfall, he ran in the first princely election, winning just 21 votes from 179. His aunt, Marițica Văcărescu-Ghica, went on to marry the winner of that race, Gheorghe Bibescu, after a years-long scandal. She was also a poet, although her work remained unpublished.\n\nMihail's mother Ecaterina (1819–1891), also a boyaress, descended from the Cantacuzino family through a Moldavian offshoot, and claimed ownership of an estate in Pașcani. Despite her generous dowry, the family faced bankruptcy and, during Mihail's infancy, had to go into real estate as landlords. She had eight other children with Iancu, six of whom survived into adulthood: Eufrosina m. Greceanu (1837–1870), a homemaker and courtesan; Ioan (1839–1914), a career soldier and father of writer Elena Văcărescu; Maria m. Fălcoianu (1841–1912); Ecaterina m. Lahovary (1846–1917); Alexandrina m. Darvary (1851–1899); Constantin (1850–1899). Claymoor's cousins also included Theodor C. Văcărescu, the diplomat.\n\nA graduate of Lycée Henri-IV in Paris, Văcărescu always endured as a \"great friend of France\", according to his colleagues at \"Le Figaro\". Orphaned at age 20, when his father died \"of a cold\", he and his siblings split his fortune between them and Iancu's creditors. His first calling was the army, and he reached an Captain's rank in the cavalry corps of the United Principalities, later retiring to take up work for the Bucharest daily press. According to several accounts, he was by then openly gay, or, as historian Ion Bulei writes, \"a notorious pederast\". Writer-diplomat Gheorghe Crutzescu also notes that Claymoor \"did not quite like women\", although he was particularly fond of cross-dressing acts such as La Belle Otero and the Barrison Sisters. Around 1890, he was involved in a legal conflict with a Major Baldovici, and rumor spread in the rival press that he had tried to seduce him and other army subordinates. However, Bacalbașa disputes such \"mean-spirited\" rumors as \"fables\".\nVăcărescu's first experience with Francophone journalism was at \"La Roumanie\" daily (1873–1876), where he used the pen name Velréas. He later had a stint at the left-wing paper \"Românul\" (1877–1879), where he began using his consecrated pen name. As Claymoor, he began his activity at \"L'Indépendence Roumaine\" in 1879 or 1880, taking over for the Frenchman Ulysse de Marsillac. Simultaneously, as Babylas, he was writing for \"La Roumanie Ilustrée\". These early chronicles coincided with the introduction of electric lighting, which, from ca. 1882, allowed open-air night parties to become fashionable. His regular chronicle was the \"Carnet du High-life\", which later spawned an \"Almanach du High-Life\". Claymoor's first almanac had been \"La Vie à Bucarest 1882–1883\" (\"Life in Bucharest 1882–1883\"), published with Theil & Weiss company, followed by \"La Lanterne Mondaine\" (\"Worldly Lantern\") in 1884. That year, in February, Claymoor had a row with the editor of \"L'Indépendence Roumaine\", Alexandru Ciurcu, and briefly left to work for \"Gazette de Roumanie\". In his own words, this was a \"rather burlesque incident\", sparked by Ciurcu's attempt to remove from the fashion column \"all those parties he was never invited to.\"\n\nClaymoor soon became one of the regulars at the journalists' hangout, Casa Capșa, frequenting a society that also included Nicolae Filipescu and N. T. Orășanu. Memoirist Constantin Bacalbașa recalls him as \"perfectly collegial\", \"a very decent man\". However, he also cautions that Claymoor \"was a journalist, but by no means was he one of the journalistic world; he lived inside the boyar society that had spawned and raised him\". More controversially, from 1888, when he became a Romanian delegate to the Paris World Fair, Claymoor was depicted as a political client of the ruling Conservative Party. Reports of that have it that he was also considered for the Prefecture of Constanța County by the Theodor Rosetti cabinet. A local correspondent for \"Telegraphul\" noted, tongue-in-cheek: \"High-society ladies are in favor of [his] appointment, and so is the Muslim population, especially now [in August 1888] that we are celebrating Bayram.\"\n\nWriter George Costescu describes \"L'Indépendence Roumaine\" as adhering to \"Western journalistic norms\", and notes Claymoor's role in pioneering locally the genre of \"fashion reports\": \"the crafty Mihail Văcărescu-Claymoor chronicled all the political and diplomatic receptions, all artistic reunions and balls, concerts, fêtes and weddings involving Bucharest's elite families.\" The concept was criticized by anti-elitists. In 1912, the left-wing George Ranetti argued that \"Carnet du High-life\" would have been \"more or less justified in a city like Paris\", but asked: \"what point could it serve in Romania?\" In the absence of an aristocratic culture, Claymoor only \"fed the vanities\" of a commercial \"plutocracy\". Similarly, Bulei sees the \"Carnet\" as copying from \"Le Figaro\" and \"Le Gaulois\", \"but with its Dâmbovița relish.\" He suggests that some of the chronicles—for instance one describing Zoe Sturdza, wife of the politician D. A. Sturdza—were unintentionally amusing.\n\nEarly reviewers were similarly inclined. In 1890, \"Amiculu Familiei\" newspaper described Claymoor as \"a sad figure in [Romanian] journalism\". It deplored the Frenchified culture which had produced Claymoor, but also noted that his metaphorical style was being laughed at by the Belgian paper \"La Réforme\". Yet, as Bacalbașa notes, Claymoor's writings made him \"a tiny celebrity\": \"for 24 years Bucharest has had its Claymoor epoch.\" According to the same source, Claymoor could describe \"wonderfully and competently the ladies' full attire at the various soirées that he attended. Some claimed that [Claymoor] was being paid by luxury seamstresses, but this was never proven true.\" Reportedly, subscribing to \"L'Indépendence Roumaine\" and \"only reading Claymoor's notebook therein\" was a central preoccupation for girls just out of boarding school. According to Crutzescu: \"not being cited by Claymoor [...] was a catastrophe, an insult that equated social death. Which is why Claymoor's home was always full of diverse gifts, from ladies who wished not to be forgotten, or overlooked.\" Văcărescu's recommendations were such \"that all fashionable society would adopt both the seamstress and the attire.\"\n\nAt times, his contributions doubled as theater criticism, such as when, in 1884, he chronicled \"O scrisoare pierdută\", by the Romanian classic Ion Luca Caragiale. His overall negative judgment of the play was itself judged negatively by later critics. Repeatedly included in retrospectives as one of Caragiale's detractors, he also criticized Caragiale and Paul Gusty for adapting and staging an anti-war play in 1888. However, he applauded their production of Wilbrandt's \"Tochter des Herrn Fabricius\". His competence in the field was doubted early on by columnist Dimitrie Rosetti-Max. When, in 1887, it was announced that Claymoor would be staff critic for a French troupe touring Bucharest, Rosetti-Max remarked: \"This leads me to suspect that the troupe doesn't even have costumes yet, and that Claymoor [...] is there to assess whether the artistes' corsages pass midnight inspection\".\n\nClaymoor earned more respect as a pioneer cinema critic: in 1896–1897, he was among the first to chronicle the earliest Romanian film shows and, as film historian Dinu-Ioan Nicola argues, had \"surprising critical intuitions.\" Having been present at a screening of Paul Menu's \"Romanian vistas\" in May 1897, Claymoor prophesied that \"cinema will reestablish truth and the sincerity of our lives will be transmitted over the ages, beyond ourselves. To us it is entertainment. To future generations, it will be a priceless document\". As argued by one anonymous witness, Claymoor was personally involved in film promotion, making excuses for the technical difficulties and delays. His \"Carnet\", \"I believe, has reached the peak of its glory during these days.\"\nHaving contributed directly to \"L'Indépendence Roumaine\"s success (it became the second-most popular newspaper by 1897), Claymoor made a return trip to Paris in 1899. He died in Bucharest on June 12, 1903, after falling down in front of \"L'Indépendence Roumaine\" office, just as he was bringing in his latest \"Carnet\" chronicle. Although he is sometimes assumed to have died there, on the spot, he actually did so at his sister's home. The ultimate cause of death was a peptic ulcer. Claymoor was buried at Bellu cemetery, Plot 17. His \"objets d'art\" were auctioned off by January 1904, but the \"Almanach du High-Life\" continued to be published over the following years.\n\nBy the 1920s, Bacalbașa claims, \"nobody so much as remember[ed] this [...] arbiter of female elegance\". Crutzescu also noted in passing that Claymoor's writing style was antiquated, \"so very obnoxious\". His \"yellowing notebooks\", Crutzescu writes, revealed a world \"of bearded and mustachioed gents and ladies with malakoffs that, when stirred, will rustle the way dead leaves do.\" Nevertheless, according to Ranetti, his \"aping of the Paris press\" created a school of party chroniclers, or \"Claymoorlings\". These journalists, Ranetti noted, were even active at \"Adevărul\", a nominally working-class paper.\n\nClaymoor also endured as the hero of \"so many anecdotes\" relating to his lifestyle and his alleged vanities. By the end of his life, he was completely bald, but was hiding it. One such story claims that his wig came off while bathing on the Romanian littoral and he went chasing for it in the water. Claymoor's likeness is also preserved in the work of various cartoonists, including his Capșa colleague Constantin Jiquidi, who drew him doing drag.\n\nFrom the beginning of his career in journalism, Claymoor's style irritated more senior writers, prompting them to caricature him in their fiction. In 1883, Ion Ghica and Dimitrie C. Ollănescu-Ascanio had sketched out a comedy of mores, which, if finalized, was to feature a leading character based on Claymoor. Anton Bacalbașa also refers to Claymoor as the favorite writer of Moș Teacă's ignorant wife, and gives him a brief role in one of his sketches (where Claymoore's homosexuality is again hinted at). Claymoor is more famous as the target of satires by Caragiale, in his \"Momente și schițe\" series—one of his favorite techniques here was to pastiche Claymoor's \"pirouettes-and-colored-ribbons\" prose. Caragiale's sketch \"High-life\", first published on Christmas Eve 1899, is entirely dedicated to Claymoor, who appears as \"Edgar Bostandaki\" or \"Turturel\" (\"Turtledove\"), chronicler for the fictional \"Voice of the Aurochs\". A licentious typo subverts his description of a high-society dame as an \"indefatigable sylphid\", and he has to deal with her husband's wrath (readers were left unsure as to what the hinted typo was).\n\nThere are other supposed echoes of Claymoor in Romanian prose. Author Radu Cernătescu claims that Claymoor is the character \"Poponel\", appearing in \"Craii de Curtea-Veche\"—a 1929 novel by Mateiu Caragiale (son of Ion Luca). This contradicts other accounts, according to which \"Poponel\" is based on another Romanian aristocrat, who was still alive in 1936. Caragiale Jr was publicly friends with a gay man, Count Ferdinand de Montesquiou-Fézensac. A distant relative of Claymoor's, the Count had died nine years before \"Craii\"s publication. As noted by Angelo Mitchievici, Montesquiou-Fézensac is turned into a Bostandaki-like caricature in Caragiale's novel. Such tropes also appeared at a later stage in literature: Petru Dumitriu referred to Claymoor (as \"Michel Ipsilanti-Seymour\"), and to the Bostandaki–typo sketch, in his own novel, \"Family Chronicle\".\n\n"}

{"id": "9281593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9281593", "title": "Códice de Roda", "text": "Códice de Roda\n\nThe Códice de Roda or Códice de Meyá (Roda or Meyá codex) is a medieval manuscript that represents a unique source for details of the 9th and early 10th century Kingdom of Navarre and neighbouring principalities. It is currently held in Madrid as Real Academia de la Historia cód. 78.\n\nThe codex is thought to date from the late 10th century, although there are additions from the 11th century, and it was compiled in Navarre, perhaps at Nájera, written in a visigothic minuscule in several different hands with cursive marginal notes. It is , and contains 232 folios. The manuscript appears to have been housed at Nájera in the 12th century, and later in the archives of the cathedral at Roda de Isábena at the end of the 17th century. In the next century, it was acquired by the prior of Santa María de Meyá, passing into private hands, after which only copies and derivative manuscripts were available to the scholarly community until the rediscovery of the original manuscript in 1928.\n\nThe codex includes copies of well-known ancient and medieval texts, as well as unique material. The first two-thirds of the compilation reproduces a single work, Paulus Orosius' \"Historiarum adversum paganos libri VII\". Also notable are Isidore of Seville's \"History of the Vandals and Suebi\" and \"History of the Goths\", the \"Chronica prophetica\" (a chronicle related to the \"Chronicon Albeldense\"), and a genealogy of Jesus. Unique items include a lists of Arab rulers and of the Christian kings of Asturias-León, Navarre and France, a chronicle of the Kingdom of Navarre, the \"Chronicle of Alfonso III\", a necrology of the Bishops of Pamplona and the \"De laude Pampilone epistola\". It also includes a chant in honour of an otherwise unknown Leodegundia Ordóñez, Queen of Navarre. Still, the manuscript is perhaps best known for its genealogies of the dynasties ruling on both sides of the Pyrenees.\n\nThe genealogies in the Roda Codex have played a critical role in interpreting the scant surviving historical record of the dynasties covered. The family accounts span as many as five generations, ending in the first half of the 10th century. These include the Íñiguez and Jiménez rulers of Pamplona, the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe, Ribagorza, Pallars, Toulouse and the duchy of Gascony. It has recently been suggested that these genealogies, reminiscent of the work of Ibn Hazm, were prepared in an Iberian Muslim context in the Ebro valley and passed to Navarre at the time the codex was compiled.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1375901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1375901", "title": "DNS zone", "text": "DNS zone\n\nA DNS zone is any distinct, contiguous portion of the domain name space in the Domain Name System (DNS) for which administrative responsibility has been delegated to a single manager.\n\nThe domain name space of the Internet is organized into a hierarchical layout of subdomains below the DNS root domain. The individual domains of this tree may serve as delegation points for administrative authority and management. However, usually it is furthermore desirable to implement fine-grained boundaries of delegation, so that multiple sub-levels of a domain may be managed independently. Therefore, the domain name space is partitioned into areas (\"zones\") for this purpose. A zone starts at a domain and extends downward in the tree to the leaf nodes or to the top-level of subdomains where other zones start.\n\nA DNS zone is implemented in the configuration system of a domain name server. Historically, it is defined in the zone file, an operating system text file that starts with the special DNS record type \"Start of Authority\" (SOA) and contains all records for the resources described within the zone. This format was originally used by the Berkeley Internet Name Domain Server (BIND) software package, and is defined in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035.\n\nMost top-level domain name registry operators offer their name spaces to the public or to entities with mandated geographic or otherwise scoped purpose for registration of second-level domains. Similarly an organization in charge of a lower level domain may operate its name space similarly and subdivide its space.\n\nEach registration or allocation of subdomain space obligates the registrant to maintain an administrative and technical infrastructure to manage the responsibility for its zone, including sub-delegation to lower-level domains. Each delegation confers essentially unrestricted technical autonomy over the allocated space. An area of one or more subdomains that has been delegated for management is called a DNS zone. A zone always starts at a domain boundary to include all leaf nodes (hosts) in the domain, or it ends at the boundary of another independently managed zone.\n\nAs each domain is further divided into sub-domains, each becoming a DNS zone itself with its own set of administrators and DNS servers, the tree grows with the largest number of leaf nodes at the bottom. At this lowest level, in the end-nodes or leaves of the tree, the term \"DNS zone\" becomes essentially synonymous with the term \"domain\", both in terms of use and administration. The term \"domain\" is used in the business functions of the entity assigned to it and the term \"zone\" is usually used for configuration of DNS services.\n\nThe top-level domain arpa serves as a delegation zone for various technical infrastructure aspects of DNS and the Internet, and does not implement the registration and delegation system of the country and generic domains.\nThe name \"arpa\" is a remnant of the ARPANET, one of the predecessor stages of the Internet. Intended as a transitional aid to the DNS system, deleting the domain arpa was later found to be impractical. Consequently, the name was officially redefined as an acronym for \"Address and Routing Parameter Area\". It contains sub-zones used for reverse resolution of IP addresses to host names (IPv4: in-addr.arpa, IPv6: ip6.arpa), telephone number mapping (ENUM, e164.arpa), and uniform resource identifier resolution (uri.arpa, urn.arpa).\n\nAlthough the administrative structure of this domain and its sub-domains is different, the technical delegation into zones of responsibility is similar and the DNS tools and servers used are identical to any other zone. Sub-zones are delegated by components of the respective resources. For example, 8.8.2.5.5.2.2.0.0.8.1.e164.arpa., which might represent an E.164 telephone number in the ENUM system, might be sub-delegated at suitable boundaries of the name. An example of an IP addresses in the reverse DNS zone is 166.188.77.208.in-addr.arpa, which represents the address 208.77.188.166 and resolves to the domain name \"www.example.com\". In the case of IP addresses, the reverse zones are delegated to the Internet service provider (ISP) to which the IP address block is assigned. When an ISP allocates a range to a customer, it usually also delegates the management of that space to the customer by insertion of name server resource records pointing to the customer's DNS facilities into their zone, or provides other management tools. Allocations of single IP addresses for networks connected through network address translation (NAT) typically do not provide such facilities.\n\nAs an example of the DNS resolving process, consider the role of a recursive DNS resolver attempting to look up the address \"en.wikipedia.org.\". It begins with a list of addresses for the most authoritative name servers it knows about – the root zone name servers (indicated by the full stop or period), which contains name server information for all top-level domains of the Internet.\n\nWhen querying one of the root name servers, it is possible that the root zone will not directly contain a record for \"en.wikipedia.org.\", in which case it will provide a referral to the authoritative name servers for the \"org.\" top level domain (TLD). The resolver is issued a referral to the authoritative name servers for the \"org.\" zone, which it will contact for more specific information. Again when querying one of the \"org.\" name servers, the resolver may be issued with another referral to the \"wikipedia.org.\" zone, whereupon it will again query for \"en.wikipedia.org.\". Since () \"en.wikipedia.org.\" is a CNAME to \"text.wikimedia.org.\" (which is in turn a CNAME to \"text.esams.wikimedia.org.\"), and the \"wikipedia.org.\" name servers also happen to contain authoritative data for the \"wikimedia.org.\" zone, the resolution of this particular query occurs entirely within the queried name server, and the resolver will receive the address record it requires with no further referrals.\n\nIf the last name server queried did not contain authoritative data for the target of the CNAME, it would have issued the resolver with yet another referral, this time to the zone \"text.wikimedia.org.\". However, since the resolver had previously determined the authoritative name servers for the zone \"org.\", it does not need to begin the resolution process from scratch but instead start at zone \"org.\", thus avoiding another query to the root name servers.\n\nThere is no requirement that resolving should involve any referrals at all. Looking up \"en.wikipedia.org.\" on the root name servers always results in referrals, but if an alternative DNS root is used which is set up to contain a record for \"en.wikipedia.org.\", then the record is returned on the first query.\n\n"}

Farber (born c. 1938) is an American newspaper reporter for \"The New York Times\", whose investigations into the deaths of several patients at an Oradell, New Jersey, hospital led to the murder trial of Dr. Mario Jascalevich, a physician at the hospital who was alleged to have used a powerful muscle relaxant in what became known as the \"Dr. X\" case. After refusing to turn over notes from his investigation in response to a subpoena from the defense attorney in the case, Farber was jailed for contempt and the newspaper fined, ending up spending 40 days in jail with fines of $285,000 assessed. Appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, the case set a precedent for the limitations of shield laws in the United States.\n\nFarber's initial involvement in what would become known as the Dr. X case began in June 1975 when the paper received a letter from a woman claiming that as many as 40 patients had been murdered at a hospital by its chief surgeon. The letter handed to him offered no information as to where the alleged murders had occurred or who the murderer was- if there was anything at all to the letter.\n\nFarber pursued the case by speaking with someone in the forensic toxicology field who was able to recall a case at Riverdell Hospital, a private medical facility that had since closed. Further investigation led to the identification of Dr. Mario Jascalevich as the hospital's chief surgeon. While Jascalevich's surgical patients routinely survived, those of a new surgeon were dying at a significantly high rate. This new surgeon, together with directors of the hospital, opened Jascalevich's locker on October 31, 1966, and found 18 near empty vials of curare, a powerful muscle relaxant that could cause death if not administered in conjunction with artificial respiration.\n\nAttorney Raymond A. Brown blamed other doctors at the hospital of framing Jascalevich to cover up their own ineptitude and charged that Farber had conspired with prosecutors to advance their respective careers by pointing the finger of blame at Jascalevich. After Brown subpoenaed the reporter,\nFarber testified in the case but cited the First Amendment of the United States Constitution when he refused to turn over thousands of pages of the reporter's notes that the defense had requested, citing a compelling right to protect the identity of the sources used in the articles from individuals who had spoken to him with the expectation that their confidence would be maintained. \"Time\" magazine called the deadlock \"a head-on collision between the First and Sixth Amendments\", citing the conflict between the reporter's and newspaper's right of Freedom of the Press and the defendant's Right to a fair trial. Trial judge William J. Arnold had Judge Theodore Trautwein address the issues related to the release of the papers in his role as assignment judge for all Bergen County courts. In July 1978, Trautwein sentenced Farber to six months in jail and assessed fines of $5,000 each day to \"The Times\", saying that Farber had chosen placing \"your privilege and your concept of your constitutional rights above the rights of the people of this state and this defendant\"\n\nWhen Farber was about to be jailed, his attorneys filed for an emergency stay on a weekend and New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Morris Pashman arrived in his golfing attire to grant the stay. When the full court heard the case the next day, Pashman was the only dissenter as the court upheld the lower court ruling and ordered that Farber serve time in jail. When the court reaffirmed the lower court action in a decision in September 1978, Pashman and fellow Justice Alan B. Handler were the only dissenters.\n\nWith several breaks for appeals, Farber ended up spending a total 40 days in the Bergen County Jail and was not released until October 24 after Jascalevich was acquitted. The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld Trautwein's decision and stripped reporters of shield law protections, though the New Jersey Legislature responded by passing even stronger shield laws to protect reporters.\n\nTrautwein's actions in regard to Farber have been used as a case study in both law schools and schools of journalism. Jane E. Kirtley of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press cited how \"Farber's case roused journalists out of their complacency\", noting that \"Going to jail for more than a month is significant in anyone's eyes.\"\n\nIn November 1978, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to take the case, citing the fact that neither the United States Constitution nor existing state shield laws provide journalists with an absolute privilege to refuse to provide information demanded in a criminal case by a defendant.\n\nIn January 1982, Governor of New Jersey Brendan Byrne issued a pardon to reporter M. A. Farber and ordered that $101,000 in fines be returned to \"The Times\". The paper's attorney, Floyd Abrams, was planning efforts to file for the return of the additional $185,000 that had been assessed in civil contempt fines.\n\n"}

Completed in 1788, it is one of the oldest houses in the French Quarter, and was built in the older French colonial style, rather than the more current Spanish colonial style of that time. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970 for its architectural significance. The Louisiana State Museum owns the house and provides tours.\n\nMadame John's Legacy stands north of Jackson Square, on the southwest side of Dumaine Street between Royal and Chartres Streets. The building's name derives from a story by New Orleans author George Washington Cable, and refers to a building that previously stood on the site. It is a French colonial raised cottage, its ground level a full-height basement built out of brick, and a wood frame main level above. The exterior is clad in wooden boards. Behind the main building is an open courtyard, with a brick slave quarters, kitchen, and garconnière at the rear of the property probably dating to the 1820s. The basement level of the house appears shorter than it was when built, in part because the street level has been raised in the intervening centuries.\n\nAlthough archival records point to 1788 as the date of completion for its construction, archaeological investigations suggest that the house possibly incorporates a significant amount of an earlier one built on the site circa 1730 by François Marin and occupied by his widow, the New Orleans businesswoman Elisabeth Réal, until her death in 1777. Following the 1788 fire, owner Manuel de Lanzos instructed the American contractor Robert Jones to recycle as much brick and iron hardware as possible from his damaged house, suggesting that enough of it survived the fire to be included in the rebuilding. Whether entirely rebuilt in 1788 or a restoration of a damaged structure, the house managed to survive the 1794 fire unscathed. It underwent a number of alterations in the 19th century, most notably as part of a conversion to apartments in the late 19th century. In 1947 the house was donated to the Louisiana State Museum and operated as a museum until 1965, when it was closed due to hurricane damage. It was subjected to a painstaking restoration in the early 1970s, restoring it as much as possible to its late 18th-century appearance, and reopened.\nThis house is briefly seen in the 1994 movie \"Interview with the Vampire\" in a scene where caskets are being carried out of the house while Louis (Brad Pitt) is describing Lestat (Tom Cruise) and Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) going out on the town. Part of \"12 Years a Slave\" was also filmed at the house.\n\n\n"}

Located in St. Mark's Square, Venice, it is one of the 11 civic museums run by the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia. The museum extends along the southside of the square on the upper floors of the Procuratorie Nuove. With its rich and varied collections, the Museo Correr covers both the art and history of Venice.\n\nThe Museo Correr originated with the collection bequeathed to the city of Venice in 1830 by Teodoro Correr. A member of a traditional Venetian family, Correr was a meticulous and passionate collector, dedicating most of his life to the collection of both works of art and documents or individual objects that reflected the history of Venice. Upon his death, all this material was donated to the city, together with the family's Grand Canal palace which then housed it. The nobleman also left the city funds to be used in conserving and extending the collections and in making them available to the public.\n\nThe period when he was gathering his collections was a very particular one, as the Republic of Venice had fallen in 1797 and for decades thereafter the city would be under foreign rulers and out of real necessity, many Venetian families were eager to sell off their valuable collections. Several collections ended up being bought by foreigners, but in the early decades of the 19th century there were still many pieces on the market. An insatiable collector, Correr, from his youth bought all sorts of objects and dedicated all his resources in putting together an incredible amount of material. Correr would reveal himself to have a sharp eye, putting together a collection that was undoubtedly very original. He was explicit about his intention that the collections should be made available to the public, and the museum was finally open in 1836.\n\nOver the years, the contents of the museum would be catalogued and organized to provide scholars with a study facility and the general public with the opportunity to see the best from each individual collection. Subsequent bequests, donations and acquisitions would be added to the collection, ultimately leading to various pieces being housed on other venues.\n\nAmong the new pieces were the collections donated by several important Venetian families, such as the Molin, the Zoppetti, the Tironi, the Sagredo, and the Cicogna, and these included significant paintings, maiolica, glass pieces, and bronzes. In 1887, the enlarged collection was moved from Palazzo Correr to the nearby Fondaco dei Turchi, where it was laid out in a new display. However, in 1922, the Museo Correr was moved again to its present location in Piazza San Marco.\n\nIn the 1990s, the entire civic museums system was redesigned, all under a single municipal administration. In 1996, thanks to an agreement with the Italian Ministry of Culture, the \"St. Mark's Square Museums\" ticket was launched, granting entrance not only to the Museo Correr, but also the Doge's Palace, the Museo Archeologico Nazionale and the Monumental Rooms of the Biblioteca Marciana. Finally, in March 2008, the Museo Correr became part of the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia system.\n\nThe building that encloses the far end of the Piazza San Marco is known as the Napoleonic Wing. The design and early building works date from the period when Venice was part of the Kingdom of Italy (1806–1814), in which Napoleon was represented by the vice-regent Eugène de Beauharnais. The two long wings that run the length of the Square are the Procuratie Vecchie and the Procuratie Nuove, which had housed the offices and residences of some of the main individuals of the Venetian Republic.\n\nWhen the city came under Napoleonic rule, the French emperor and his court realized that public representation of imperial power posed certain logistical and political problems. Having rejected the Doge's Palace because of its complex past, these turned to the Procuratie Nuove, the former residence of the \"Procuratore di San Marco\", along the southern edge of the Square. Designed in 1582 by Vincenzo Scamozzi, this structure itself had at the time been intended to complete the vast project for the reorganization of the Piazza San Marco, which had begun with Sansovino in the mid-16th century. From 1586 to 1596, works were complete on the ten arcades that extended beyond Sansovino's Library, and then, around 1640, the rest of the Procuratie Nuove was completed by Baldassarre Longhena. And this was the building which, by January 1807, Napoleon decreed should become the Imperial Palace.\n\nAll the interiors within the Procuratie Nuove were changed with the re-decoration reflecting the taste for Neoclassicism, together with the Napoleonic Wing – which now stands opposite the St. Mark's Basilica – which was designed by Giuseppe Soli and Lorenzo Santi and incorporated to the palace.\n\nWhen Venice moved under Austrian dominion in 1814, the palace served as the House of Habsburg and emperor Francis I would stay there until 1815.\n\nIn 1866, after Venice became part of unified Italy, the palace passed to the House of Savoy. In 1919, Victor Emmanuel III, king of Italy, handed it over to the State for use by the Ministry of Education. Hence, in 1920, part of the building was used to house the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, and then in 1922 another area became home to the Museo Correr.\n\nAn antechamber leads into the Napoleonic Gallery which runs across the end of the Piazza San Marco. Comprising a Ballroom, Throne Room and Banqueting Hall, this is the core of the public area of the palace, exhibiting artworks by Antonio Canova.\n\nThe first floor of the Museo Correr illustrates the life and culture of the Venetian Republic over the centuries of its political grandeur and independence.\n\n\nBeginning in Room 19, the art collection in Museo Correr is divided into two parts. On the first floor, four rooms house the collection of small bronzes, including pieces by Veneto region sculptors from the late 15th to the first decades of the 17th century. On the second floor, 19 rooms display the Picture Gallery, which focuses primarily on Venetian painting up to the 16th century. There are also rooms dedicated to maiolica-work and to carved ivories.\n\nThe Picture Gallery starts at the end of Room 14 and comprises examples of Venetian paintings from the very earliest days right up to the beginning of the 16th century.\n\nRepeatedly re-organized during the history of the museum, the gallery still substantially reflects the original collection left by Teodoro Correr, comprising artworks by Giovanni Bellini (including the early \"Crucifixion\", \"Transfiguration of Christ\", a \"Madonna and Child\" and \"Dead Christ Supported by Two Angels\"), Antonello da Messina, Cosmè Tura, Vittore Carpaccio (\"Man with Red Hat\" and \"Two Venetian Ladies\"), and others. Further bequests, gifts, loans, and acquisitions have added to this heritage. Other artists who are present throughout the exhibition rooms include Paolo Veneziano, Lorenzo Veneziano, Stefano Veneziano, Jacobello di Bonomo, Michele Giambono, Jacobello del Fiore, Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello, Matteo Giovannetti, Bartolomeo Vivarini, Leonardo Boldrini, Pieter Bruegel the Younger, Jacopo Bellini, Alvise Vivarini, Cima da Conegliano, Lorenzo Lotto, Boccaccio Boccaccino, and several other important Italian and European artists.\n"}

{"id": "38271802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38271802", "title": "Original order", "text": "Original order\n\nOriginal order is a concept in archival theory that a group of records should be maintained in the same order as they were placed by the record's creator. Along with provenance, original order is a core tenet of the archival concept of \"respect des fonds.\" By keeping records in their original order, additional contextual information about the record's creator and the environment of their creation is preserved.\n\nThe idea that archivists should arrange their records according to the order in which they were originally organized comes from Prussian archivists in the late nineteenth century. While trying to manage the arrangement of records within the Prussian State Archives, the archivists came up with \"Registraturprinzip\", which formed the basis for what we know as original order.\n\nThough assuredly a feature of earlier archival practice, the first noteworthy articulation of the practice of original order was presented in the \"Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives\" (also known as The Dutch Manual) in 1898, where, in the chapter on the arrangement of archival documents, point #16 states: \"The system of arrangement must be based on the original organization of the archival collection, which in the main corresponds to the organization of the administrative body that produced it.\"\n\nThe Society of American Archivists \"Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology\" calls original order a \"fundamental principle of archives\" and posits two primary purposes: preserving \"relationships and evidential significance\" of records and facilitating use of the records by maintaining \"the record creator's mechanisms to access.\". The SAA definition qualifies that original order is not necessarily the order of the records upon their delivery to an archive, noting that the original order may need to be created by the archivist.\n\nArchivists such as Maria Guercio have argued that \"the principal role of the record is, in fact, that of rendering the act or fact, which is the subject of the record in its original administrative context, accessible and knowable across time and space.\"\n\nOriginal order \"exists to preserve the original context of records,\" and some records depend on their original context to tell their whole story. One of the common sets of core values of archivists, original order is one of the factors that sets archives apart from other institutions.\n\nThe principle of original order has been critiqued by many archivists. T. R. Schellenberg argued that the principle emerged from countries with a registry system of archival custodianship, in which registrars played an important role as intermediary between the agency or institution creating records and the archive that acquired and preserved them. The imposition of order by these registrars ensured records were logically and consistently organized prior to their delivery to the archive. For Schellenberg, writing in the 1960s, this registrar function no longer existed and records instead often were delivered to an archive absent any coherent or comprehensible system of organization. Per Schellenberg:\n...in most modern filing systems, the original order given record items contributes little to an understanding of organic activity, and an archivist should therefore preserve the order only if it is useful... Methods of filing are unimportant to an archivist, except from the point of view of their utility in making records accessible.\n\nOther critics have noted that even the restoration of a presumed original order can risk erasing evidence of the management of a group of records after their original creation and organization. As well, the shifting, malleable nature of large organizations, in which groups of records can pass through multiple custodians prior to their transfer to an archive, makes even identifying an original order difficult. Tom Nesmith also argue that original order \"retains little meaning in postmodern archives where origins are never final, but the subjects of new histories waiting to be done. When records arrive at an archives, they will have an order of some kind, but it will not likely be the actual original order of the records, as documents can be easily and repeatedly moved around prior to archiving them.\" In today's modern age, technology ensures that fonds and collections are continuously growing, which makes knowing the original order difficult.\n\nAnother criticism of original order is that it prioritizes the system of arrangement of records creators over an arrangement that best suits future users and researchers. This \"usability\" critique \"acknowledges the evidential superiority of documents over filing systems by placing primary emphasis on access to documents.\". Use of an archival collection and ongoing processing or rearrangement may also impact ideas of what constitutes \"original\" order and what contextual information is prioritized for preservation, as Heather MacNeil details in recounting the ongoing \"custodial intervention\" of one collection.\n"}

It was produced by Frank Marshall for Lucasfilm Ltd., with Lucas and Howard Kazanjian as executive producers.\n\nThe first installment in the \"Indiana Jones\" film franchise, it stars Harrison Ford as archaeologist Indiana Jones, who battles a group of Nazis searching for the Ark of the Covenant. It co-stars Karen Allen as Indiana's former lover, Marion Ravenwood; Paul Freeman as Indiana's rival, French archaeologist René Belloq; John Rhys-Davies as Indiana's sidekick, Sallah; Ronald Lacey as Gestapo agent Arnold Toht; and Denholm Elliott as Indiana's colleague, Marcus Brody.\n\nThe film originated from Lucas' desire to create a modern version of the serials of the 1930s and 1940s. Production was based at Elstree Studios, England, but filming also took place in La Rochelle, France, Tunisia, Hawaii, and California from June to September 1980.\n\n\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" became 1981's top-grossing film and remains one of the highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards in 1982, including Best Picture, and won for Best Art Direction, Film Editing, Sound, and Visual Effects with a fifth Academy Award: a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing. It is often considered one of the greatest films ever made. In 1999, it was included in the U.S. Library of Congress' National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film began a franchise including several sequels, a television series, \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" (1992–1996), and numerous video games.\n\nIn 1936, archaeologist Indiana Jones braves an ancient booby-trapped temple in Peru and retrieves a golden idol. He is confronted by rival archaeologist René Belloq and the indigenous Hovito people. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones surrenders the idol to Belloq and escapes aboard a waiting floatplane.\n\nJones returns to his teaching position at Marshall College, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform Jones that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of an ancient Egyptian object known as \"the Staff of Ra\". Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant — the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra (used to project a beam of sunlight on a building in a diorama of the city) is the key to finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in Tanis, Egypt, in which the Ark is buried.\n\nThe agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Ravenwood has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece but Jones returns to the bar and fights the Nazis to save Marion. During the fight, the bar is set ablaze and the headpiece lands in the flames. Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece and flees the tavern screaming in agony. Jones and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Jones in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her.\n\nThe pair travels to Cairo, where they meet up with Jones' friend and skilled digger Sallah. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the Well of Souls with a replica of the headpiece (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Jones and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Jones discovers Marion is alive when he finds her bound and gagged in a tent. He refuses to release her out of fear of alerting the Nazis. Jones, Sallah, and a small group of diggers unearth the Well of Souls and acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer Colonel Dietrich arrive and seize the Ark from Jones, throwing Marion into the Well of Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the flying wing that was to transport the Ark to Berlin. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to London aboard tramp steamer \"Bantu Wild\".\n\nThe next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and intercepts the ship. Belloq and Dietrich seize the Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels with them to an island in the Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with an RPG-2, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact and kill Marion in the process. The Nazis take Jones and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq, dressed as an Israelite kohen gadol, performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark and finds it full of sand. Ghosts emerge from the Ark, destroying the equipment the Nazis are using to film the opening, and Jones tells Marion to close her eyes and not look. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the ghosts are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror as the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Jones and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the Army Intelligence agents inform Jones and Marcus Brody that the Ark is someplace safe and will be studied by \"top men\". The Ark is then shown being stored in a giant government warehouse (Hangar 51) among countless similar crates.\n\n\nProducer Frank Marshall played a pilot in the airplane fight sequence. The stunt team was ill, so he took the role instead. The result was three days in a hot cockpit, which he joked was over \"140 degrees\". Pat Roach plays the Nazi mechanic with whom Jones brawls in this sequence, as well as a massive sherpa who battles Jones in Marion's bar. He had the rare opportunity to be killed twice in one film. Special-effects supervisor Dennis Muren made a cameo as a Nazi spy on the seaplane Jones takes from San Francisco to Manila.\n\nIn 1973, George Lucas wrote \"The Adventures of Indiana Smith\". Like \"Star Wars,\" which he also wrote, it was an opportunity to create a modern version of the film serials of the 1930s and 1940s. Lucas discussed the concept with Philip Kaufman, who worked with him for several weeks and came up with the Ark of the Covenant as the plot device. Kaufman was told about the Ark by his dentist when he was a child. The project stalled when Clint Eastwood hired Kaufman to direct \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\". Lucas shelved the idea, deciding to concentrate on his outer space adventure that would become \"Star Wars\". In late May 1977, Lucas was in Hawaii, trying to escape the enormous success of \"Star Wars\". Friend and colleague Steven Spielberg was also there, on vacation from work on \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". While building a sand castle at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, Spielberg expressed an interest in directing a James Bond film. Lucas convinced his friend Spielberg that he had conceived a character \"better than James Bond\" and explained the concept of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Spielberg loved it, calling it \"a James Bond film without the hardware\", although he told Lucas that the surname 'Smith' was not right for the character. Lucas replied, \"OK. What about 'Jones'?\" Indiana was the name of Lucas' Alaskan Malamute, whose habit of riding in the passenger seat as Lucas drove was also the inspiration for \"Star Wars\" Chewbacca. Spielberg was at first reluctant to sign on, as Lucas had told him that he would want Spielberg for an entire trilogy, and Spielberg did not want to work on two more scripts. Lucas told him, however, that he already had the next two movies written, so Spielberg agreed. But when the time came for the first sequel, it was revealed that Lucas had nothing written for either sequel.\nThe following year, Lucas focused on developing \"Raiders\" and the \"Star Wars\" sequel \"The Empire Strikes Back\", during which Lawrence Kasdan and Frank Marshall joined the project as screenwriter and producer respectively. Between January 23–27, 1978, for nine hours a day, Lucas, Kasdan, and Spielberg discussed the story and visual ideas. Spielberg came up with Jones being chased by a boulder, which was inspired by Carl Barks' Uncle Scrooge comic \"The Seven Cities of Cibola\". Lucas later acknowledged that the idea for the idol mechanism in the opening scene and deadly traps later in the film were inspired by several Uncle Scrooge comics. Lucas came up with a submarine, a monkey giving the Hitler salute, and Marion Ravenwood punching Jones in Nepal. Kasdan used a 100-page transcript of their conversations for his first script draft, which he worked on for six months. Ultimately, some of their ideas were too grand and had to be cut: a mine chase, an escape in Shanghai using a rolling gong as a shield, and a jump from an airplane in a raft, all of which made it into the prequel, \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\".\n\nSpielberg and Lucas disagreed on the character: although Spielberg saw him as a Bondian playboy, Lucas felt the character's academic and adventurer elements made him complex enough. Spielberg had a darker vision of Jones, interpreting him as an alcoholic similar to Humphrey Bogart's character Fred C. Dobbs in \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948). This characterization fell away during the later drafts, though elements survive in Jones's reaction when he believes Marion to be dead. Costume designer Deborah Nadoolman credits \"Secret of the Incas\" (1954), starring Charlton Heston, as an influence on the development of the character, noting that the crew watched the film together several times. Nadoolman based the look of Ford's costume on that of Heston's, and observed that Indiana is a \"kinder and gentler\" Harry Steele.\n\nInitially, the film was rejected by every major studio in Hollywood, mostly due to the $20 million budget and the deal Lucas was offering. Eventually Paramount agreed to finance the film, with Lucas negotiating a five-picture deal. By April 1980, Kasdan's fifth draft was produced, and production was getting ready to shoot at Elstree Studios, with Lucas trying to keep costs down. With four illustrators, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" was Spielberg's most storyboarded film of his career to date, further helping the film economically. He and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule to keep costs down and to follow the \"quick and dirty\" feel of the old Saturday matinée serials. Special effects were done using puppets, miniature models, animation, and camera trickery. \"We didn't do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four. It was like silent film--shoot only what you need, no waste\", Spielberg said. \"Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie.\"\n\nPrincipal photography began on June 23, 1980, at La Rochelle, France, with scenes involving the Nazi submarine, which had been rented from the production of \"Das Boot\". The U-boat pen was a real one from World War II. The crew moved to Elstree Studios for the Well of Souls scenes, the opening sequence temple interiors and Marion Ravenwood's bar. The Well of Souls scene required 7,000 snakes. The only venomous snakes were the cobras, but one crew member was bitten on set by a python. The bulk of the snakes' numbers were made up with giant but harmless legless lizards known as Scheltopusiks (\"Pseudopus apodus\") which occur from the Balkan Peninsula of southeastern Europe to Central Asia. Growing to 1.3 m they are the largest legless lizards in the world and are often mistaken for snakes despite some very obvious differences such as the presence of eyelids and external ear openings, which are both absent from all snakes, and a notched rather than forked tongue. In the finished film, during the scene in which Indiana comes face-to-face with the cobra, a reflection in the glass screen that protected Ford from the snake was seen, an issue that was corrected in the 2003 digitally-enhanced re-release. Unlike Indiana, neither Ford nor Spielberg has a fear of snakes, but Spielberg said that seeing all the snakes on the set writhing around made him \"want to puke\".\n\nThe opening scene in the Peruvian jungle was filmed on the island of Kauai, one of the islands of Hawaii, to which Spielberg would return for \"Jurassic Park\". The first shot features a misty view of Kalalea Mountain, the culminating point in Anahola, Hawaii. The \"temple\" location is on the Huleia River, on the Kipu Ranch, south from Kaumualii Highway on the east coast, just south of Lihue, the island's main town. Kipu is a working cattle ranch, not generally open to the public. The Peruvian section (but actually filmed in Hawaii) featured live tarantulas of a Mexican species (\"Brachypelma\") on Harrison Ford and Alfred Molina, and are harmless to humans, and in fact of a species which are commonly kept as exotic pets. A fiberglass boulder 22 feet (7 m) in diameter was made for the scene where Indiana escapes from the temple; Spielberg was so impressed by production designer Norman Reynolds' realization of his idea that he gave the boulder a more prominent role in the film and told Reynolds to let the boulder roll another .\n\nThe scenes set in Egypt were filmed in Tunisia, and the canyon where Indiana threatens to blow up the Ark was shot in Sidi Bouhlel, just outside Tozeur. The canyon location had been used for the Tatooine scenes from 1977's \"Star Wars\" (many of the location crew members were the same for both films) where R2-D2 was attacked by Jawas. The Tanis scenes were filmed in nearby Sedala, a harsh place due to heat and disease. Several cast and crew members fell ill and Rhys-Davies defecated in his costume during one shot. Spielberg averted disease by eating only canned foods from England, but did not like the area and quickly condensed the scheduled six-week shoot to four-and-a-half weeks. Much was improvised: the scene where Marion puts on her dress and attempts to leave Belloq's tent was improvised as was the entire plane fight. During that scene's shooting, a wheel went over Ford's knee and tore his left leg's cruciate ligament, but he refused local medical help and simply put ice on it.\n\nThe fight scenes in the town were filmed in Kairouan, while Ford was suffering from dysentery. Stuntman Terry Richards had practiced for weeks with his sword to create the scripted fight scene, choreographing a fight between the swordsman and Jones' whip. However, after filming the initial shots of the scene, after lunch due to Ford's dysentery, Ford and Spielberg agreed to cut the scene down to a gunshot, with Ford saying to Spielberg \"Let's just shoot the sucker\". It was later voted in at No.5 on \"Playboy\" magazine's list of best all time scenes. Most of the truck chase was shot by second unit director Michael D. Moore following Spielberg's storyboards, including Indiana being dragged by the truck (performed by stuntman Terry Leonard), in tribute to a famous Yakima Canutt stunt. Spielberg then filmed all the shots with Ford himself in and around the truck cab. Lucas directed a few other second unit shots, in particular the monkey giving the Nazi salute.\n\nThe interior staircase set in Washington, D.C. was filmed in San Francisco's City Hall. The University of the Pacific's campus in Stockton, California, stood in for the exterior of the college where Jones works, while his classroom and the hall where he meets the American intelligence agents was filmed at the Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, England, which was again used in \"The Last Crusade\". His home exteriors were filmed in San Rafael, California. Opening sequence exteriors were filmed in Kauai, Hawaii, with Spielberg wrapping in September in 73 days, finishing under schedule in contrast to his previous film, \"1941\". The Washington, D.C. coda, although it appeared in the script's early drafts, was not included in early edits but was added later when it was realized that there was no resolution to Jones' relationship with Marion. Shots of the Douglas DC-3 Jones flies on to Nepal were taken from \"Lost Horizon\", and a street scene was from a shot in \"The Hindenburg\". Filming of Jones boarding a Boeing Clipper flying-boat was complicated by the lack of a surviving aircraft. Eventually, a post-war British Short Solent flying-boat formerly owned by Howard Hughes was located in California and substituted.\n\nAfter viewing the film's rough cut, Lucas's then-wife and frequent collaborator Marcia Lucas opined that there was no emotional closure, because Marion did not appear at the ending. Although Marcia is not credited in the film, her suggestion led to Spielberg reshooting the final exterior sequence with Ford and Allen. The final scene, where the Ark is placed in a vast warehouse, was Spielberg's homage to \"Citizen Kane\", where Kane's lost childhood sled, \"Rosebud\", is similarly treated. \n\nThe special visual effects for \"Raiders\" were provided by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat in the water and miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added a veil of fire over the exploding head scene. (The PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down. Brian Muir and Keith Short created the Ark prop based on the paintings of James Tissot.\n\nBen Burtt, the sound effects supervisor, made extensive use of traditional foley work in yet another of the production's throwbacks to days of the Republic serials. He selected a .30-30 Winchester rifle for the sound of Jones' pistol. Sound effects artists struck leather jackets and baseball gloves with a baseball bat to create a variety of punching noises and body blows. For the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence, fingers running through cheese casserole and sponges sliding over concrete were used for the slithering noises. The sliding lid on a toilet cistern provided the sound for the opening of the Ark, and the sound of the boulder in the opening is a car rolling down a gravel driveway in neutral. Burtt also used, as he did in many of his films, the ubiquitous Wilhelm scream when a Nazi falls from a truck. In addition to his use of such time-honored foley work, Burtt also demonstrated the modern expertise honed during his award-winning work on \"Star Wars\". He employed a synthesizer for the sounds of the Ark, and mixed dolphins' and sea lions' screams for those of the spirits within. Michael Pangrazio created the final shot's matte painting on glass over three months.\n\nJohn Williams composed the score for \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", which was the only score in the series performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, the same orchestra that performed the scores for the \"Star Wars\" saga. The score most notably features the well-known \"Raiders March\". This piece came to symbolize Indiana Jones and was later used in the scores for the other three films. Williams originally wrote two different candidates for Jones's theme, but Spielberg enjoyed them so much that he insisted that both be used together in what became the \"Raiders March\". The alternately eerie and apocalyptic theme for the Ark of the Covenant is also heard frequently in the score, with a more romantic melody representing Marion and, more broadly, her relationship with Jones. The score as a whole received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Score, but lost to the score to \"Chariots of Fire\" composed by Vangelis.\n\nThe only video game based exclusively on the film is \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", released in 1982 by Atari for their Atari 2600 console. The first third of the video game \"Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures\", released in 1994 by JVC for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System, is based entirely on the film. Several of the film's sequences are reproduced (the boulder run and the showdown with the Cairo Swordsman among them); however, several inconsistencies with the film are present in the game, such as Nazi soldiers and bats being present in the Well of Souls sequence, for example. The game was developed by LucasArts and Factor 5. In the 1999 game \"Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine\", a bonus level brings Jones back to the Peruvian temple of the film's opening scene. In 2008, to coincide with the release of \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", Lego released the \"Lego Indiana Jones\" line—which included building sets based on \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\"—and LucasArts published a video game based on the toyline, \"\", which was developed by Traveller's Tales.\n\nMarvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer Walt Simonson and artists John Buscema and Klaus Janson. It was published as \"Marvel Super Special\" #18 and as a three-issue limited series. This was followed with the comic book series \"The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones\" which was published monthly from January 1983 through March 1986.\n\nIn 1981, Kenner released a doll of Indiana Jones, and the following year they released nine action figures of the film's characters, three playsets, as well as toys of the Nazi truck and Jones' horse. They also released a board game. In 1984, miniature metal versions of the characters were released for a role playing game, \"The Adventures of Indiana Jones\", and in 1995 Micro Machines released die-cast toys of the film's vehicles. Hasbro released action figures based on the film, ranging from , to coincide with \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" on May 1, 2008. Later in 2008, and in 2011, two high-end sixth scale (1:6) collectible action figures were released by Sideshow Collectibles, and Hot Toys, Ltd. respectively. A novelization by Ryder Windham was released in April 2008 by Scholastic to tie in with the release of \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\". A previous novelization by Scottish author Campbell Armstrong (under the pseudonym Campbell Black) was concurrently released with the film in 1981. A book about the making of the film was also released, written by Derek Taylor.\n\nThe film was released on VHS, Betamax and VideoDisc in pan and scan only, and on laserdisc in both pan and scan and widescreen. For its 1999 VHS re-issue, the film was remastered in THX and made available in widescreen. The outer package was labeled Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark for consistency with the film's prequel and its sequel. The subsequent DVD release in 2003 features this title as well. The title in the film itself remains unchanged, even in the restored DVD print. In the DVD, two subtle digital revisions were added. First, a connecting rod from the giant boulder to an offscreen guidance track in the opening scene was removed from behind the running Harrison Ford; second, a reflection in the glass partition separating Ford from the cobra in the Well of Souls was removed. Shortly before the theatrical release of \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", \"Raiders\" (along with \"The Temple of Doom\" and \"The Last Crusade\") was re-released on DVD with additional extra features not included on the previous set on May 13, 2008. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in September 2012. Previously, only \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" had been available on Blu-ray.\n\n\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" opened at #1 and grossed $8,305,823 from 1,078 theaters during its opening weekend . The film, made on an $18 million budget, grossed $384 million worldwide throughout its theatrical releases. In North America, it was by some distance the highest-grossing film of 1981. It also became Paramount Pictures' most successful film at that time, and remains one of the top twenty-five highest-grossing films ever made when adjusted for inflation. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 70 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run. Its IMAX release in 2012 opened at #14 and grossed $1,673,731 from 267 theaters ($6,269 theater average) during its opening weekend. In total, the IMAX release grossed $3,125,613 domestically.\n\nThe film was highly acclaimed by critics and audiences alike. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 95% \"Certified Fresh\" rating with a 9.2/10 average rating. The sites critical consensus stating: \"Featuring bravura set pieces, sly humor, and white-knuckle action, \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is one of the most consummately entertaining adventure pictures of all time.\", as well as an 85% rating on Metacritic, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\n\nIn his review for \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby praised the film, calling it, \"one of the most deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made.\" Roger Ebert in his review for the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote, \"Two things, however, make \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" more than just a technological triumph: its sense of humor and the droll style of its characters [...] We find ourselves laughing in surprise, in relief, in incredulity at the movie's ability to pile one incident upon another in an inexhaustible series of inventions.\" He later added it to his list of \"Great Movies\". \"Rolling Stone\" said the film was \"the ultimate Saturday action matinee–a film so funny and exciting it can be enjoyed any day of the week.\" Bruce Williamson of \"Playboy\" claimed: \"There's more excitement in the first ten minutes of \"Raiders\" than any movie I have seen all year. By the time the explosive misadventures end, any movie-goer worth his salt ought to be exhausted.\" Stephen Klain of \"Variety\" also praised the film. Yet, making an observation that would revisit the franchise with its next film, he felt that the film was surprisingly violent and bloody for a PG-rated film.\n\nThere were some dissenting voices: \"Sight & Sound\" described it as an \"expensively gift-wrapped Saturday afternoon pot-boiler\", and New Hollywood champion Pauline Kael, who once contended that she only got \"really rough\" on large films that were destined to be hits but were nonetheless \"atrocious\", found the film to be a \"machine-tooled adventure\" from a pair of creators who \"think just like the marketing division\". (Lucas later named a villain, played by \"Raiders\" Nazi strongman Pat Roach, in his 1988 fantasy film \"Willow\" after Kael.) Years later, screenwriter Paul Schrader, of \"Taxi Driver\" acclaim, considers the date of the decline of American cinema as the release of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", viewing it to be simply a bad movie. \n\nThe film was subsequently nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, in 1982 and won four (Best Sound, Best Film Editing, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley, and Michael D. Ford). It also received a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing. It won numerous other awards, including a Grammy Award and Best Picture at the People's Choice Awards. Spielberg was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award.\n\n\nFollowing the success of \"Raiders\", a prequel, \"The Temple of Doom\", and two sequels, \"The Last Crusade\" and \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\", were produced, with a third sequel set for release in 2021. A television series, entitled \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\", was also spun off from this film, and details the character's early years. Numerous other books, comics, and video games have also been produced.\n\nIn 1998, the American Film Institute placed the film at number 60 on its top 100 films of the first century of cinema. In 2007, AFI updated the list and placed it at number 66. They also named it as the 10th most thrilling film, and named Indiana Jones as the second greatest hero. In 1999, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the U.S. Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. Indiana Jones has become an icon, being listed as \"Entertainment Weekly\"s third favorite action hero, while noting \"some of the greatest action scenes ever filmed are strung together like pearls\" in this film.\n\nAn amateur, near shot-for-shot remake was made by Chris Strompolos, Eric Zala, and Jayson Lamb, then children in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. It took the boys seven years to finish, from 1982 to 1989. After production of the film, called \"\", it was shelved and forgotten until 2003, when it was discovered by Eli Roth and acclaimed by Spielberg himself, who congratulated the boys on their hard work and said he looked forward to seeing their names on the big screen. Scott Rudin and Paramount Pictures purchased the trio's life rights with the goal of producing a film based on their adventures making their remake.\n\nIn 2014, film director Steven Soderbergh published an experimental black-and-white version of the film, with the original soundtrack and dialogue replaced by an electronic soundtrack. Soderbergh said his intention was to encourage viewers to focus on Spielberg's extraordinary staging and editing: \"This filmmaker forgot more about staging by the time he made his first feature than I know to this day.\"\n\nAssessing the film's legacy in 1997, Bernard Weinraub, film critic for \"The New York Times\", which had initially reviewed the film as \"deliriously funny, ingenious, and stylish\", maintained that \"the decline in the traditional family G-rated film, for 'general' audiences, probably began\" with the appearance of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". \"Whether by accident or design,\" found Weinraub, \"the filmmakers made a comic nonstop action film intended mostly for adults but also for children.\" Eight years later, in 2005, viewers of Channel 4 rated the film as the 20th-best family film of all time, with Spielberg taking best over-all director honors.\n\nOn \"Empire\" magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, \"Raiders\" ranked second, beaten only by \"The Godfather\". The film was ranked at number 11 in a list of the 25 best action and war films of all time by \"The Guardian\".\n\nIn conjunction with the Blu-ray release, a limited one-week release in IMAX theaters was announced for September 7, 2012. Steven Spielberg and sound designer Ben Burtt supervised the format conversion. No special effects or other visual elements were altered, but the audio was enhanced for surround sound.\n\nIn December 2012, the University of Chicago's admissions department received a package in the mail addressed to Henry Walton Jones, Jr., Indiana Jones' full name. The address on the stamped package was listed for a hall that was the former home of the university's geology and geography department. Inside the manila envelope was a detailed replica journal similar to the one Jones used in the movie, as well as postcards and pictures of Marion Ravenwood. The admissions department posted pictures of the contents on its Internet blog, looking for any information about the package. It was discovered that the package was part of a set to be shipped from Guam to Italy that had been sold on eBay. The package with the journal had fallen out in transit and a postal worker had sent it to the university, as it had a complete address and postage, which turned out to be fake. All contents were from a Guam \"prop replicator\" who sells them all over the world. The university will display its replica in the main lobby of the Oriental Institute.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25594376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25594376", "title": "Reader's Digest Complete Book of Australian Birds", "text": "Reader's Digest Complete Book of Australian Birds\n\nThe Reader's Digest Complete Book of Australian Birds is a book first published by Reader's Digest Services Pty Ltd of Sydney, Australia in 1976 and reprinted several times, with a completely revised edition issued in 1986.\n\nThe book is small folio in size, 330 mm in height by 230 mm in width. It describes and illustrates bird species recorded from Australia, mostly at one species per page, using photographs sourced from the National Photographic Index of Australian Wildlife. The distinctive, mainly blue, cover features a photograph of a pair of olive-backed sunbirds.\n\nBefore the individual species accounts which fill most of the book there is a foreword by Alec H. Chisholm and sections on “Where birds live” and “Naming and identifying birds”, while following the species accounts are chapters on “Rare visitors, escaped captives and unsuccessful introductions”, “Classification by order and family”, “Behaviour that distinguishes species” by Ian Rowley, “Migrants and nomads” and “How birds' numbers are regulated” by H.J. Frith, “Birds of prehistoric Australia” by G.F. van Tets, and “The mysterious origins of Australian birds” by Richard Schodde, before the indexes and acknowledgments.\n\nThe consultant editor of the 616-page first edition was H.J. Frith. A review by Simon Bennett in the Emu, the journal of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union, said\n”The Reader's Digest book is a co-operative effort, combining contemporary expertise in Australian ornithologywith the photographic excellence of the National Photographic Index of Australian Birds.”\n”Almost every species is illustrated by one or sometimes two colour photographs. These are of high quality and no doubt represent the best published assemblage of photographs of Australian birds. The few poor quality and black-and-white photographs can be excused; the picture of the Paradise Parrot, for example, is the only one known and is of considerable historic interest. Although not all photographs were taken in the field, the techniques used convey a natural setting.”\n”The text accurately summarizes much that is known of Australian birds. The list of contributors is like a \"Who's Who\" of Australian ornithology, which makes the reviewer's job difficult. The information is presented in an easily read style, free from jargon. It is good to see many ecological and conservational concepts in the text. The only major criticism relates to the information on distribution. Some of the maps are not consistent with the text (e.g. Black Butcherbird and Noisy Miners) or with published information.”\n\nThe first edition was reprinted, with minor corrections, in 1977, 1979, 1982 and 1983.\n\nFrith died in 1982; when a thoroughly revised and updated edition () was issued in 1986 the consultant editors were Richard Schodde and Sonia Tidemann. Chisholm's foreword was replaced by one by the new editors, the chapters at the back of the book were moved to the front, and new material (e.g. a chapter on “The functions of feathers”) was added. In the foreword Schodde and Tidemann say\n”One of the many purposes of this book is to provide the information that will allow general appreciation of the life style and habitat needs of Australia's birds. From the moment it appeared, the \"Reader's Digest Complete Book of Australian Birds\" became the pacemaker as the most comprehensive and authoritative of popular references to the birds of our continent. Its authority stemmed – as now – from its association with the CSIRO's Division of Wildlife and Rangelands Research. Most of the first edition, published in 1976, was compiled by staff of the Division; its then Chief, Dr H. J.

Many gaps have since been filled, allowing us to stress their habits more: where they live, what they feed on and how they breed, aspects not emphasised in any other publication on Australian birds.\n\n“The comprehensiveness of the new text springs from a careful updating of information from research on all species. Readers who skim its surface will notice at once the expanded text, the corrections in classification – though these are few – and the many changes to maps of distribution, based on the \"Atlas of Australian Birds\" just published by the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union. Others who dig deeper will find that the accounts of most species have been revised extensively and many completely rewritten, including all additional species; not one species has been left unadjusted.”\n\nThe second edition was reprinted in 1988, 1990 and 2007.\n\n"}

To the left of the entrance formerly stood the papal throne, which is now at the opposite side before the door leading to the Pauline Chapel.\n\nThe hall was begun under Pope Paul III by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and was completed in 1573. The elegant barrel vault is graced by the very impressive plaster decorations of Perino del Vaga. The stucco ornaments over the doors are by Daniele da Volterra.\n\nThe walls were decorated by Livio Agresti, Giorgio Vasari and Taddeo Zuccari. The frescoes depict momentous turning-points in the history of the Church, including the return of Pope Gregory XI from Avignon to Rome, the Battle of Lepanto, the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, the raising of the ban from Henry IV, the reconciliation of Pope Alexander III with Frederick Barbarossa and Peter II of Aragon offering the Kingdom to Pope Innocent III.\n\nThe hall was originally used for the reception of princes and royal ambassadors, hence its name. Consistories were held in it, but were later transferred to the Saint Peter's Basilica on November 19, 2016, and the area has also provided an occasional musical recital in the presence of the pope; during a conclave it was used as a promenade for the cardinals.\n\n\n\n"}

According to historical records from the Han Dynasty, \"Sun Bin's Art of War\" contained an extensive 89 chapters, with four volumes of pictures attached, but was lost by the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty. As a consequence, \"Sun Bin's Art of War\" is sometimes conflated with Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\".\n\nIn April 1972, bamboo slips of both Sun Tzu's and Sun Bin's works were unearthed in the Yinque Hills (Linyi city, Shandong province). Due to natural erosion, some of the bamboo slips were damaged and difficult to reinterpret. After the initial collection and study by experts, the Cultural Relic Press published a new edition of \"Sun Bin's Art of War\", divided into two volumes, each containing 15 chapters, from the 364 bamboo slips, with a total of 11,000 words.\n\nAfter a decade of textual research and study, the Cultural Relic Press made a major adjustment to the book: the second volume was no longer considered to be Sun Bin's writings; the first volume was edited and one chapter detailing five types of training was added. The current edition of \"Sun Bin's Art of War\" contains 16 chapters from 222 bamboo slips, with a total of 4891 words.\n\nDescribes the four stratagems employed in the Battle of Guiling:\n\nSun Bin discusses with King Wei of Qi about war and states: \"Only victory in war can bring about authority and prosperity\". Sun believes that the historically progressive unification accomplished in war had been an important means of facilitating the submission of feudal lords. To start a war, one must have \"a storage of materials, a just cause for war\" and must \"be well-prepared before launching an attack\". Sun also pointed out that \"Warmongers will inevitably lose and those who expect to make a fortune out of war will also suffer defeat and disgrace\".\n\nSun Bin advises King Wei and Tian Ji, engaging them in a comprehensive discussion on his basic thoughts about strategy and tactics. The chapter focuses on resolute attacks on weakly defended key enemy positions and on the military philosophy of using Tao and flexible principles to attain victory.\n\nSet in the Battle of Maling, Sun Bin and Tian Ji discuss the problems of battlefield positions in field operations. The combination of terrain, weapons and the types of soldiers is emphasized.\n\nComments on the basic principles of building and training an army, and on the factors of field command that will determine victory or defeat. On the topic of building an army, Sun Bin focuses on the employment of the best soldiers in terms of field command.\nHe stresses 'five factors that will lead to constant victory':\n\nThere are also five corollaries that will lead to constant defeat:\n\nDiscusses the methods of a commander and the principles of battle formation.\nIt emphasises that a commander must \"be well versed in both meteorology and geography. He also must get the support of his people at home, while understanding the actual situation of his enemy. In a direct battle, he knows well the basic points of the eight formations. If one is sure of victory he will fight; if unsure he should not fight.\" Sun Bin also emphasises \"that in laying a formation, the army can be divided into three divisions. In each, the best soldiers should be placed as a vanguard and every team should be followed with a sustainable reserve.\"<br>\nHe emphasises \"dividing the army into three teams\" and \"engaging one team in battle in while leaving the other two strictly in defence.\"<br>\nSun Bin says that an army must take an advantageous geographical position to attack enemy in a less defensible position. \"When land is flat there should be more armed chariots; when terrain is difficult, more cavalry should be sent: and when is narrow and blocked, there should be more archers sent.\"\n\nChapter 14 is similar to military rules and regulations of the later ages.\nIt may be divided into three parts:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1131832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1131832", "title": "The Muppet Christmas Carol", "text": "The Muppet Christmas Carol\n\nThe Muppet Christmas Carol is a 1992 American musical fantasy comedy-drama film produced by Jim Henson Productions and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Adapted from Charles Dickens's 1843 novella \"A Christmas Carol\", it is the fourth theatrical film to feature the Muppets, and the first to be produced following the death of Muppets creator Jim Henson in 1990. The film was directed by Brian Henson in his directorial debut from a screenplay by Jerry Juhl, and stars Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge, alongside Muppet performers Dave Goelz, Steve Whitmire, Jerry Nelson, and Frank Oz portraying various roles, including Gonzo narrating the film as Dickens and Kermit the Frog as Bob Cratchit. Although artistic license is taken to suit the aesthetic of the Muppets, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" otherwise follows Dickens's original story closely.\n\n\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" was released on December 11, 1992, to modest box office success and mostly positive reviews. As well as Jim Henson, the film is dedicated to fellow puppeteer Richard Hunt, who died eleven months before its release.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, in 19th Century London, Charles Dickens (played by Gonzo the Great) and his friend Rizzo act as narrators throughout the film. Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine), a surly money-lender, does not share the merriment of Christmas. Scrooge rejects his nephew Fred's invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen collecting money for charity, and tosses a wreath at a carol singing Bean Bunny. His loyal employee Bob Cratchit (played by Kermit the Frog) and the other bookkeepers request to have Christmas Day off since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees. Scrooge leaves for home while the bookkeepers celebrate Christmas. In his house, Scrooge encounters the ghosts of his late business partners Jacob and Robert Marley (played by Statler and Waldorf), who warn him to repent his wicked ways or he will be condemned in the afterlife like they were, informing him that three spirits will visit him during the night.\n\nAt one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the childlike Ghost of Christmas Past who takes him back in time to his childhood and early adult life, Dickens and Rizzo hitching a ride too. They visit his lonely school days, and then his time as an employee under Fozziwig (Mr. Fezziwig from the original story, played by Fozzie Bear), who owned a rubber chicken factory. Fozziwig and his mother throw a Christmas party, where Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle, whom he falls in love with. However, the Ghost shows Scrooge how Belle left him when he chose money over her. A tearful Scrooge dismisses the Ghost as he returns to the present.\n\nAt two o'clock, Scrooge meets the gigantic, merry Ghost of Christmas Present who shows him the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Fred’s house where Scrooge is made fun of. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Bob Cratchit's house, learning his family is content with their small dinner, Scrooge taking pity on Bob's ill son Tiny Tim (played by Robin the Frog). The Ghost of Christmas Present abruptly ages, commenting that Tiny Tim will likely not survive until next Christmas. Scrooge and the Ghost go to a cemetery, where the latter fades away. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come then approaches Scrooge, appearing as a tall, silent cloaked figure. While Dickens and Rizzo abandon the audience to avoid being frightened, the Ghost takes Scrooge into the future.\n\nScrooge and the Ghost witness a group of businessmen discussing the death of an unnamed colleague where they would only attend the funeral if lunch is provided. In a den, Scrooge recognizes his charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker trading several stolen possessions of the deceased to a fence named Old Joe. The Ghost transports Scrooge to Bob's house, discovering Tiny Tim has died. Scrooge is escorted back to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out his own grave, revealing Scrooge as the man who died. Realizing this, Scrooge decides to change his ways.\n\nAwakening in his bedroom on Christmas Day, Scrooge decides to surprise Bob's family with a turkey dinner, and ventures out with Bean, Dickens, Rizzo, and the charity workers to spread happiness and joy around London. Scrooge goes to the Cratchit house, at first putting on a stern demeanor, and then revealing he intends to raise Bob's salary and pay off his mortgage. Dickens narrates how Scrooge became a secondary father to Tiny Tim, who escaped death. Scrooge, the Cratchits, and the neighborhood celebrate Christmas.\n\n\nFollowing Jim Henson's death in 1990, talent agent Bill Haber approached his son Brian with the idea of filming an adaptation. Haber told Henson that \"\"Christmas Carol\" is the greatest story of all time, you should do that\" and later informed Henson that he sold the idea to ABC as a television movie. Longtime Muppets writer Jerry Juhl was hired to write the script and decided to insert Charles Dickens as the stand-in narrator in order to remain faithful to the original prose of the written material. Henson stated that Gonzo was chosen because he was the least likely choice to play Charles Dickens, while Rizzo the Rat was added to inject some humor and serve as a Greek chorus. Established Muppet characters were initially written to portray the ghosts, with various accounts stating Robin the Frog or Scooter was to be the Ghost of Christmas Past, Miss Piggy to be the Ghost of Christmas Present, and Gonzo (before he was written to portray Dickens) or Animal as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. However, the idea was scrapped in favor of new Muppet characters that would better underline the ominous nature. After the script was submitted for approval to ABC, the executives of Walt Disney Pictures offered to purchase the script for a feature film instead of a television movie.\n\nEnglish actors David Hemmings, Ron Moody, and David Warner and comedian George Carlin were considered to portray Ebenezer Scrooge. Henson later offered the role to Michael Caine, who replied: \"I'm going to play this movie like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company. I will never wink, I will never do anything Muppety. I am going to play Scrooge as if it is an utterly dramatic role and there are no puppets around me.\" Production took place at the Shepperton Studios, England. During filming, in order to allow for the Muppets and the human actors to be in the shot, floors had to be removed and re-inserted, with Michael Caine having to walk across narrow planks between the Muppets and their performers. Additionally, the buildings in the London street scenes were constructed by hand but diminished in size in order to achieve the appearance that the streets were relatively longer. When the musical sequence \"It Feels Like Christmas\" ends with the crane shot, the short buildings became visibly seen in the background, in which Brian Henson explained on the DVD audio commentary that they were aware of the problem during shooting, but eventually decided that the closing shot was worth it as they believed not many people would notice the error.\n\nDisney appeared to have high expectations for the film, being their widest-released film of the holiday season and the second-widest release under the Walt Disney Pictures banner that year. However, the film opened in sixth place, initially reported to have collected $5.9 million in box office estimates, which was later revised to have grossed $5 million. Ultimately, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" grossed a total of $27.3 million in North America. Despite being a modest box office success, \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" did not make much of an impact during its theatrical release, having to face competition from \"\" and Disney's own \"Aladdin\".\n\nThe film received mostly favorable reviews from critics. Janet Maslin, reviewing for \"The New York Times\", summarized the film as not a \"great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare. But there \"is\" a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand.\" \"Chicago Sun-Times\" film critic Roger Ebert, who gave the film three stars out of four, praised the technical achievements, but felt it \"could have done with a few more songs than it has, and the merrymaking at the end might have been carried on a little longer, just to offset the gloom of most of Scrooge's tour through his lifetime spent spreading misery.\" On the television program \"Siskel & Ebert\", his partner \"Chicago Tribune\" film critic Gene Siskel gave the film a Thumbs Down although he was favorable towards Michael Caine's performance. Also from \"The Chicago Tribune\", Dave Kehr reviewed the film as \"a talky, plodding film that seems likely to bore children and adults in equal measure.\" Nevertheless, Kehr praised Val Strazovec's production design and John Fenner's cinematography believing its \"shadowy, naturalistic lighting creates a new look for a puppet film\", but derided Paul Williams's songs as unmemorable. Likewise, \"Variety\" praised the production design and criticized Williams's songs, writing \"Muppets Christmas Carol\" is \"not as enchanting or amusing as the previous entries in the Muppet series. But nothing can really diminish the late Jim Henson's irresistibly appealing characters.” Giving the film three stars out of five, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote the film is \"liberal but fun adaptation of a classic\" that \"turns out to be quite touching as Muppet movies go. Less pleasing are the forgettable songs that offer both clumsy word construction and dire music that eats away at the aesthetic quality of the movie. But you'll be too busy looking out for the assorted Muppets to care much.\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Muppet Christmas Carol\" has a 73% approval rating, based on 40 reviews, with a rating average of 6.5 out of 10. The critical consensus states \"It may not be the finest version of Charles Dickens' tale to grace the screen, but \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" is funny and heartwarming and serves as a good introduction to the story for young viewers.\"\n\nThis is the first \"Muppet\" film co-produced and released by Walt Disney Pictures—and the rights to the Muppets featured in the film would later be purchased by the studio's parent company. In addition to theatrical releases, the film has also been made available on home video formats. It was released on VHS in the US on November 5, 1993, in the UK on November 19 and twice on DVD in Region 1. The first DVD release on October 8, 2002, was in a full-screen-only format. Walt Disney Home Entertainment re-released the film on DVD on November 29, 2005, in conjunction with Kermit the Frog's 50th-anniversary celebration; this time the DVD contained both full-screen and widescreen presentations. The film was also released in Region 2.\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released a 20th-anniversary collector's edition on Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy on November 6, 2012. The release doesn't include the film's extended cut. However, the song \"When Love Is Gone\" and its accompanying scene can be viewed in its entirety on the full-screen version of the anniversary edition of \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\", though it is cut in the widescreen format.\n\nThe film's original score was composed by Miles Goodman with songs written by Paul Williams. Williams previously worked with the Muppets on the soundtrack to \"The Muppet Movie\" (1979) in which he and Kenneth Ascher were nominated for an Academy Award for writing \"Rainbow Connection\". Goodman previously scored several films that were directed by Muppet performer Frank Oz.\n\n\"The Muppet Christmas Carol: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\" contains all of the songs from the film, which were written by Paul Williams, as well several cues from the score by Miles Goodman. The performances are by the Muppet characters as well as Caine, and the album also includes the songs \"Room in Your Heart\" and \"Chairman of the Board\" that were recorded but never filmed. As with all Muppet films (except \"Muppets from Space\" (1999)), \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" was shot as a musical. The soundtrack album peaked at number 189 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The soundtrack was digitally re-released by Walt Disney Records on November 6, 2012.\n\n\"When Love Is Gone\" was a song performed by the character Belle (portrayed by Meredith Braun) as she laments that Scrooge's love of money has replaced his love of her. The song itself was deleted from the original 1992 theatrical edition by Jeffrey Katzenberg of Walt Disney Studios, who believed that the following scene would not appeal to young children. Instead, the song appeared in (and was played during) the end credits scene. Henson objected to this decision. The concluding song, \"The Love We Found\", is a direct counterpoint to it.\n\nDirector Brian Henson commented: \"\"When Love Is Gone\" was not in the theatrical release, and is presently missing from some copies of the movie, which is a real shame.\" The song titled \"When Love Is Gone\" is only included on some home media releases of \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" which are now out of print.\n\nThe song is included on all of the 1993 VHS and LaserDisc releases. The LaserDisc version includes the only widescreen presentation of this song ever released.\n\nThe 2002 and 2005 DVD releases do retain the song, but only in the full-screen version of the film. A 2012 standalone DVD release of the film uses the same disc from the 2005 release, so it also contains the song. However, a different DVD was used for the 2012 Blu-ray combo pack which does not contain the song.\n\nThe current iTunes Store digital release includes the song and scene as an \"extra\". The VHS tape, LaserDisc and select DVD releases are the only way to view \"The Muppet Christmas Carol\" on home video along with the following scene intact.\n\n\n"}

The final list of 100 names was decided by an online survey run by South African media giant Media24. After voting closed, brief biographies were written for each person on the list; the book was published in 1999 by Human & Rousseau, in English and Afrikaans. This survey preceded the SABC Great South Africans survey by three years, and evoked less public outcry. \n\nThere were two father-son pairs and two husband-wife pairs in the final list, namely Ernest and Harry Oppenheimer, Govan and Thabo Mbeki, Nelson and Winnie Mandela, and Walter and Albertina Sisulu. One of the list candidates, André Brink, is also an author of some of the biographies in the book.\n\nAn initial list of 120 names was compiled by historian Trwella Cameron and publisher JJ Human. The names of B. J. Vorster and Chris Hani were initially deliberately left out. Users of Media24's web portal were asked to vote on the initial list and to submit suggestions for additions to the list. From the submissions, it was determined by the publisher that both B.J. Vorster and Chris Hani should be included in the list after all. People who were not South Africans, but who influenced South Africa, were also eligible for the list. During the survey and in the book, no labels such as \"politician\", \"sportsperson\", \"activist\" etc. were provided for the names.\n\nOriginally voting was scheduled to end in July 1999, but the deadline was later extended to 31 August, and then into October.\n\nThe voting portal contained a discussion forum so people could argue the merits or demerits of candidates. Members of the public could vote in favour of a candidate but could also vote against a candidate. All candidates' names on the web site linked to short profiles about them.\n\nOne of the ways in which this list differs from SABC3's Great South Africans list is that it contains very few sportsmen, and certainly none of the post-1994 heroes that featured prominently in the SABC list. The biographies printed in \"They Shaped Our Century\" are often cited as a source of information. The SABC survey was not limited to internet users and received coverage from many media outlets. In the SABC survey, one could vote for a candidate but not against a candidate.\n\nCriticism against the survey included questions about why Gustav Preller did not make the list, or why statesmen Hertzog and Steyn were ranked below sportsman Gary Player, sportsman Danie Craven and stage artist Pieter-Dirk Uys. Another critic acclaimed the biographic article about Mandela (by Vincent Maphati) but derided the articles about Verwoerd as less than satisfactory. It was also said that the survey compared apples with oranges, and questions were raised about whether Chris Barnard could truly have been said to have had more influence than Harry Oppenheimer, Jan Smuts and Gary Player.\n\nThe survey's own web site fielded questions about the omission of Barney Barnato, Ysuf Veriava, Johan de Villiers, and Sammy Marks.\n\nThese are the top 20 names published in the book. The labels are arbitrary and are not an indication of the field in which they contributed most to South Africa.\n\n\n"}
