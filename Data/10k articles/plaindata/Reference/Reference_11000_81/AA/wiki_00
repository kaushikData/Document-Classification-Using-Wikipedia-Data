The museum is dedicated to increasing understanding of the folk artist and painter Alice Moseley.\n\nThe museum was opened in the Blue House, the place of Moseley’s last residence, by Moseley’s son Tim shortly after her death. The museum moved to the historic Bay St. Louis Railroad Depot, across the street from the Blue House, and was re-opened on March 2013. Admission to the museum is free.\n\nAlice Latimer Moseley (1909–2004), known colloquially as Miss Alice, was born in Birmingham, Alabama, where she met and married W. J. Moseley from Batesville, Mississippi. They moved to Memphis, Tennessee, during World War II and Miss Alice taught eighth grade English in Whitehaven and Memphis over the next 30 years. She began painting while caring for her Alzheimer's-afflicted mother, painted her first 40 paintings, went to the Nashville flea market with her son, and sold all 40 of her paintings within 30 minutes. They were purchased by a Mr. Barr, who used them to decorate his chain of steakhouses in Kentucky. That was the day that Alice Moseley became a professional folk artist. She always painted in acrylics because she said she was impatient and needed something that would dry quickly. Early on Moseley was labeled as an idyllic folk artist by Jules Pfeiffer in \"Folk Art Finder\", and \"idyllic folk Art\" was described as showing not only what the artist saw but what he or she wanted to see. Moseley began to receive acclaim and had a successful career while she lived in Pope, Mississippi, and did shows mostly in Memphis. After the death of her husband she moved to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, in 1989, when she was 80 years old. She described those years in Bay St. Louis as the happiest and most successful years of our life. Moseley's paintings are historic in that they depict Southern life in the country during earlier times; they are literary in that Moseley's paintings did not just depict scenes but had to tell a story; Moseley's paintings are often comedic and reflect Alice Latimer Moseley's wonderful sense of people and sense of humor. Some of her more popular titles are: \"Life Is So Daily\", \"The House Is Blue But the Old Lady Ain't\", and \"Labor Versus Management\", which shows a farmer throwing his hat down on the ground in anger while his mule sits on his hindquarters with a little smile on his face.\n\nAlice Moseley painted until her death in July 2004, at the age of 94. Her blue house in Bay St. Louis was untouched by Hurricane Katrina even though it's only a half mile from the beach. Her son Tim Moseley founded the Alice Moseley Folk Art and Antique Museum after Katrina in 2006, and it has since been relocated from the blue house to the historic Bay St. Louis train depot. Visitors to Bay St. Louis rave about the museum and the entertaining and informative tours given by docents at the museum. The museum is free and is open Monday through Saturday from 10 to 4.\n\n"}

It received its number for being the 60,000th locomotive built by Baldwin.\n\nIt was designed to be the best locomotive that Baldwin ever made. It boasts three cylinders, weighs about , including tender, and can pull a load of up to . Its top speed is .\n\n60000 was very innovative, carrying unusual technology, including a water-tube firebox. This was intended to improve efficiency but the tubes were prone to burst inside the firebox. It is also a compound, expanding the steam once in the inside cylinder and then again in the two outside cylinders. Although compounding increases efficiency, it was an extra complication that the US railroads had mostly rejected by the middle twenties. The weight and length of the engine were too much for all but the heaviest and straightest tracks.\n\nThis locomotive was experimental and was meant to be the model for future development. However, its demonstration runs never persuaded railroads to purchase more and in 1933, it was purchased by the Franklin Institute Science Museum for $1 and remains there today.\n\nAfter a series brief test runs following construction, the 60000 was sent to the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Test Plant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Placed on rollers without its tender, it was tested on the traction dynamometer to measure its performance, which included maximum drawbar horsepower. Following tests at the Altoona Test Plant, the Pennsylvania Railroad placed the engine in freight service between Enola Yard near Harrisburg and Morrisville Yard via the Trenton Cutoff. During testing on the PRR, 60000 pulled a maximum of 7,700 tons.\n\nFollowing testing on the PRR, the 60000 was sent for additional testing on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Between November and December 1926, the 60000 was tested on the Cumberland Division between Brunswick and Keyser, Maryland, the Connellsville Division between Cumberland, Maryland, and Connellsville, Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh Division, which included the Sand Patch and Seventeen-Mile grades.\n\nIn February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's Beardstown Division of Illinois. The 60000 was run in tandem with the CB&Q's own M2-A Class 2-10-2 number 6157, in order to compare coal and water consumption. Overall, the 60000 was superior in its coal and water consumption.\n\nOn 24 February 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad. Testing was performed on the Pecos division between Clovis and Belen, New Mexico. As with the CB&Q, the AT&SF compared the performance of the 60000 with that of its own power in the form of two 3800-Class 2-10-2s. Once more the 60000 demonstrated superior fuel consumption than the locomotives of the host railroad.\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1927, the 60000 was sent to the Southern Pacific Railroad, which overhauled the locomotive and converted it to an oil burner at its Sacramento Shops. Following its conversion, the 60000 was tested in both freight and passenger service on the Sacramento Division, during which the engine carried a Southern Pacific tender. Following tests on the SP, the 60000 was sent to the Great Northern Railway between Everett, Washington and Minot, North Dakota. Overall, the 60000 did not perform as well on oil as it did on coal\n\nConverted back to coal, the 60000 was then returned to the Baldwin Locomotive Works and used as a stationary boiler before being sold to the Franklin Institute.\n\n"}
{"id": "910628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=910628", "title": "Bob Roberts", "text": "Bob Roberts\n\nBob Roberts is a 1992 American-British satirical mockumentary film written, directed by, and starring Tim Robbins. It depicts the rise of Robert \"Bob\" Roberts Jr., a right-wing politician who is a candidate for an upcoming United States Senate election. Roberts is well financed, due mainly to past business dealings, and is well known for his music, which presents conservative ideas with gusto.\n\nThe film is Robbins's directorial debut, and is based on a short segment of the same title and featuring the same character that Robbins portrayed on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\n\"Bob Roberts\" takes place in Pennsylvania, USA in 1990. It depicts a fictitious senatorial race between a conservative Republican country singer, Bob Roberts (Tim Robbins), and the incumbent Democrat, Brickley Paiste (Gore Vidal). The film is shot through the perspective of Terry Manchester (Brian Murray), a British documentary filmmaker who is following the Roberts campaign. Through his lens we see Roberts travel across the state, performing songs about drug users, lazy people and the triumph of traditional family values over the rebelliousness of the 1960s. As the campaign continues, Paiste remains in the lead until a scandal arises involving him and a young woman who was seen emerging from a car with him. Paiste claims that she was a friend of his granddaughter whom he was driving home, but he cannot shake the accusations. \n\nThroughout the campaign, reporter Bugs Raplin (Giancarlo Esposito) attempts to use the documentary being made about Roberts as a way to expose him to the public as a fraud. Raplin believes that Roberts' anti-drug charity, Broken Dove, is connected to an old Central Intelligence Agency drug trafficking scheme. As the election approaches, Roberts is asked to appear on a network's sketch comedy show. When Roberts announces that he will not be playing the song he had originally proposed, a dispute breaks out between the cast and producers of the show. This new song turns out to be nothing more than a thinly veiled campaign endorsement, and an angry staff member of the network pulls the plug mid-performance. As Roberts is leaving the studio, he is seemingly shot by a would-be assassin. Raplin, who has been causing problems for the campaign, is initially linked to the shooting, but he is later cleared when it is found that due to constrictive palsy in his right hand he physically could not have fired the gun. Following the incident, Raplin contends that Roberts was never actually shot and that the gun was fired into the ground.\n\nThe campaign is boosted by public support following the assassination attempt, and Roberts wins the election with 52 percent of the vote. Although Roberts claims that his wounds have left him paralyzed from the waist down, he is seen tapping his feet at a celebration party. While Terry Manchester is interviewing Roberts' supporters outside the new Senator's hotel, a boy runs up shouting, \"He's dead, he's dead, they got him!\" When Manchester asks him what he is talking about, the boy shouts, \"Bugs Raplin! He's dead! They got him!\" A joyful celebration breaks out among Roberts' supporters, the shot changes to an image of his hotel room, and an upright walking shadow suggesting Roberts' profile passes the window before the lights go out. The film ends with a radio news report about Raplin's death at the hands of a right-wing fanatic and a shot of Manchester standing in the Jefferson Memorial, looking at the words, \"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man\", inscribed there.\n\nThe film's style is drawn from a number of real and mock documentaries, and its shots are crafted to create this effect, in many cases through the use of hand-held cameras. Not only does Roberts' character draw from 60s era iconography of Bob Dylan, it also contains scenes inspired by the 1967 documentary, \"Dont Look Back\", made about the singer, employing a similar (although consciously constructed) cinema verité style. The film also draws from Rob Reiner's 1984 mockumentary \"This Is Spinal Tap\" which Robbins states is one of his favorite films, and directly references this during the scene in which Roberts gets lost in an auditorium attempting to find the stage before his performance. In the case of Gore Vidal's character, the majority of the lines were not scripted, and instead Vidal based his role upon his own political beliefs, and his real-life positions on many of the fictional election topics.\n\nWhile critics and audiences have responded to this film by connecting Roberts’ character to various political figures, such as George H. W. Bush and Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, Robbins has said that the film related more to the political system in general than any specific politician. Much of Robbins' commentary is addressed at the role of the media in election campaigns. Some have critiqued Robbins for his approach toward political satire, stating that his references to Reagan-era politics and the rebelliousness of the 1960s are simply too anachronistic in the context of the 1990s, but others have praised it for framing political commentary as a Hollywood comedy. In 2018, Robbins said “‘Bob Roberts’ came true,” referring to President Trump. \n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 97% based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10.\nRoger Ebert praises the film \"I like \"Bob Roberts\" - I like its audacity, its freedom to say the obvious things about how our political process has been debased - but if it had been only about campaign tactics and techniques, I would have liked it more\" but says the thread about the investigative journalist doesn't work. He gives the film 3 out of 4 stars.\n\n"}
{"id": "23916098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23916098", "title": "Bolivian Declaration of Independence", "text": "Bolivian Declaration of Independence\n\nBolivia's independence was definitively proclaimed on 6 August 1825 at a congress held in Chuquisaca.\n\nWhile the Gran Colombian troops disembarked in the port of Callao under the command of General Antonio José de Sucre, General Andrés de Santa Cruz—who until a short time before had been fighting in the ranks of the \"realistas\" (Spanish loyalists)—arrived to share the libertarian ideas of José de San Martín and was sent to augment Sucre's troops, beginning their march toward Upper Peru. In August 1823, they entered the city of La Paz and, forced to wage battle, Santa Cruz emerged victorious from the Battle of Zepita on 25 August 1823 against one of General Valdez's divisions.\n\nBetween the years of 1822 and 1823, the situation in Peru had turned chaotic: the armies had been defeated by the \"realistas\" and politics had plunged into anarchy. It was with these lamentable conditions that Simón Bolívar was confronted when on 1 September 1823 he arrived in Lima. The congress gave him charge of the military.\n\nThe situation could not have been more sober for the patriots. The independence of Peru was not assured, and on 29 February 1824 the \"realistas\" once again succeeded in occupying Lima. But this time, the political upheavals taking place in Spain spelled the final disintegration of the Spanish troops in America.\n\nGeneral Pedro Antonio Olañeta, a recalcitrant absolute monarchist, rebelled against the viceroy La Serna (who himself had liberal and constitutionalist tendencies) because he attributed to him the desire to separate from the monarchy and liberate Peru from the absolute rule that Olañeta wanted to impose.\n\nBolívar met the divided \"realistas\" and quickly organized an army made up of Colombians, Argentines, and Peruvians. With this army, on 6 August 1824 he defeated the Spanish Army led by General José de Canterac and Colonel Manuel Isidoro Suárez on the fields of Junín. This victory represented above all the first step to the final triumph in the Battle of Ayacucho. The Spanish commanders—Canterac, Váldés, and de la Serna—reassembled in Cuzco and decided to reorganize their forces and flee before the victors of Junín.\n\nCharged by Bolívar, Sucre decided to continue his military campaign in Peru. On 9 December 1824, the independents triumphed in a spectacular victory on the plain of Ayacucho. The \"Independence of Peru and America\" was recognized with the capitulation of the viceroy La Serna. In response to the victory won in Ayacucho, he was later promoted, at the request of the Peruvian Congress, to Marshal and as General in Chief by the Colombian legislature. Bolivar later assigned him the mission to liberate Upper Peru and install a responsible independent national government. Besides, his role was limited to giving an appearance of legality to the process that Upper Peruvians themselves had begun already. But for the Spanish military personnel in Upper Peru, it was too little too late, as since 1815 (and the War of the Republiquetas in certain parts of Upper Peru), all out guerilla warfare had raged in this part of the continent, with hostilities esclatating since 1821.\n\nIn Cochabamba on January 16, a cavalry troop of American Dragoons rose up in rebellion. Colonel José Martínez arrested officials and the governor and then arrived to capture the First Battalion, Infantry Regiment Fernando VII's barracks, convincing the regiment to switch sides. He then asked the Santa Victoria cavalry squadron to stand down at once, leaving the city's entire garrison of 800 men in the hands of the independents. He appointed Mariano Guzmán as governor and before his own resignation, appointed Colonel Saturnino Sánchez, and then swore independence.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Pedro Arraya and troopers from the Santa Victoria and American Dragoons cavalry squadrons went to Chayanta, where they also pledged their support to the Patriot cause in La Paz.\n\nIn Vallegrande, the Second Battalion of the Infantry Regiment Fernando VII (with 200 men) also rebelled, deposing Brigadier General Francisco Javier Aguilera on 26 January. Colonel José Manuel Mercado occupied Santa Cruz de la Sierra on 14 February. Mojos and Chiquitos joined in the rebellion, increasing the ranks of Spanish soldiers who changed their loyalties to the independence movement. As a consequence of these actions, Olañeta abandoned La Paz on 22 January, heading for Potosí.\n\nOn 29 January 1825, General José Miguel Lanza (coming from nearby rural zones known as the \"Republiqueta de Ayopaya\") took the city of La Paz and declared the independence of the provinces of Upper Peru. Lanza was named the first president of Upper Peru. On 6 February, Field Marshal Sucre - at the head of the Liberation Army - crossed the Desaguadero River, which was the border with Peru, and entered La Paz the next day.\n\nIn Chuquisaca, the \"Dragones de la Frontera\" Battalion of Colonel Francisco López defected to the independence cause and on 22 February officially declared the city independent.\n\nRoyalist general Pedro Antonio Olañeta stayed in Potosí, where he was welcomed late in the month by soldiers of the \"Union\" Infantry Battalion coming from Puno under the command of colonel José María Valdez. Olañeta then summoned a War Council, which agreed to continue the resistance in the name of Ferdinand VII. Next, Olañeta distributed his troops between Cotagaita fortress with the \"Chichas\" Battalion, commanded by colonel l Carlos de Medinacelli, while Valdez was sent to Chuquisaca with the \"Union\" Infantry Battalion and loyalist militias, and Olañeta himself marched toward Vitichi, with 60,000 pieces of gold from the Coin House in Potosí. Olañeta abandoned Potosí on 28 March, just before the independent vanguard led by Arralla advanced to liberate the rich mining town.\n\nIn spite the governor of Salta's (José Antionio Álvarez de Arenales) final orders not to advance, Colonel José María Pérez de Urdininea and 200 dragoons, together with the advance party of the independence forces, surprised the Tupiza garrison on 23 March. At this point, the majority of royalist troops of Upper Peru refused to continue fighting against the powerful army of Sucre and switched allegiances. \n\nColonel Medinacelli and 300 soldiers rebelled against Olañeta on 1 April, the two meeting the next day in the Battle of Tumusla, which culminated with the death of Olañeta. Diverse sources deny the existence of such a battle, arguing that Olañeta died of a single, self-inflicted gunshot. A few days later, on April 7, general José Mario Valdez surrendered in Chequelte to general Urdininea, putting an end to the war in Upper Peru and signalling victory to the local independence movement which had been active since 1811.\n\nOn 7 April, Sucre received an official letter sent by Álvarez de Arenales from Mojo (near Tupiza), informing him of the commission he had been given by the government in Buenos Aires on 8 February to treat (negotiate) with the \"realista\" leaders in the provinces of Upper Peru to end the war: \"...on the basis that they need to remain at complete liberty to agree on what best suits their interests and government.\"\n\nOn 6 August 1825, Field Marshal Antonio José de Sucre and Casimiro Olañeta, a lawyer from Chiquisaca and General Olañeta's nephew, convened all the provinces of Upper Peru to gather a congress to decide the destiny of the nation. However, the destiny of the new republic was subject to three possibilities:\n\nEven though the governments of Buenos Aires and Peru recognized this third alternative, Bolívar understood that to encourage at that moment an act of sovereignty of this nature—conspiring against the interests of Gran Colombia—as the territory of the Royal Audience of Quito could expect the same treatment as Charcas. Bolívar did not publicly undermine Sucre's authority, but did reproach him in a private letter regarding this initiative.\n\nThe General Constituent Congress of Buenos Aires, by degree on 9 May 1925, declared that \"although the four departments of Upper Peru have always belonged to this state, it is the will of the general constituent congress that they remain at full liberty to decide their fate, as they believe will suit their interests and their happiness,\" clearing the way for the independence of Upper Peru as an independent entity.\n\nSucre, a little annoyed by Bolívar's criticism, after demonstrating that he was right, announced that he would obey orders but would also leave the country because he that ordered him did not share his views. To the contrary, Bolívar was in conflict with Sucre's conscience and this compromised his faith in Bolívar's word.\n\nThe deliberating Assembly convened anew in Chuquisaca on 9 July 1825. It concluded with the determination of the complete independence of Upper Peru, in the form of a republic, for the sovereignty of its children. Finally, the president of the Assembly - José Mariano Serrano - and a commission wrote the \"Act of Independence\", which bears the date 6 August 1825 in honor of the Battle of Junín won by Bolívar in Peru, whose introduction states as follows:\n\nIndependence was declared by 7 representatives from Charcas, 14 from Potosí, 12 from La Paz, 13 from Cochabamba, and 2 from Santa Cruz.\n\nThrough a decree it was determined that the new state in Upper Peru would carry the name of República Bolívar, in honor of the liberator, who was designated as \"Father of the Republic and Supreme Chief of State\". Bolívar thanked them for these honors, but declined the presidency of the Republic, a duty he gave instead to the victor of Ayacucho, Grand Marshal Sucre, who would later be sworn in the same day as the first President of Bolivia. After some time, the subject of the name of the Young nation arose again, and a Potosian deputy named Manuel Martín Cruz offered a solution, suggesting that in the same manner which from Romulus comes Rome, from Bolívar ought to come the new nation of Bolivia.\n\nBy the time Bolívar got the news of the decision, he felt flattered by the young nation, but until then he hadn’t accepted willingly Upper Peru's fate as an independent republic because he was worried about its future, due to Bolivia's location in the center of South America; this, according to Bolivar, would create a nation that would face many future wars, which curiously did happen. Bolivar wished that Bolivia would become part of another nation, preferably Peru (given the fact that it had been part of Viceroyalty del Perú for centuries), or Argentina (since during the last decades of colonial domain it had been part of Viceroyalty del Río de la Plata), but what deeply convinced him otherwise was the attitude of the people, who longed more for independence. On August 18, upon his arrival to La Paz, there was a manifestation of popular rejoicing. The same scene repeated when the Liberator arrived to Oruro, then to Potosí and finally to Chuquisaca. Such a fervent demonstration by the people touched Bolívar, who called the new nation his \"Predilect Daughter\", and was called the \"Favorite Son\" of the new country by its people.\n\nOn 18 May 1826 in Lima, Bolívar signed on behalf of Peru a degree recognizing the independence of Bolivia.\n\nIn 2008, modern-day historians commented on the declaration of independence, bringing forth certain contradictions and controversies. The say that it was Colonel Carlos de Medinacelli who was the first liberator of Bolivia and that to this day he is a forgotten hero. After the Battle of Tumusla on 1 April 1825— a day of patriotism that should be celebrated as a historical day instead of 6 August—it was he that had the clear idea that these lands should give birth to a republican life with an identity separate from that of Argentina or Peru. They also say that upon the arrival of Bolívar and Sucre, the Spanish troops had already been defeated. As these represented a significant part of Imperial Spain, it lost its historic territory to the screams of war for the independence of ancient Charcas (Upper Peru).\n"}
{"id": "15477196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15477196", "title": "Business records exception", "text": "Business records exception\n\nThe business records exception to the U.S. hearsay rule is based on Rule 803(6) of the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE). It is sometimes referred to as the business entry rule.\n\nBusiness records, for the purposes of the exception, are any writings or records of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnosis, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge are admissible if kept in the regular course of business and if it was the regular course of business to make that record, unless the source of information or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n\nBusiness is used in Rule 803(6) to mean any business, institution, association, profession, or occupation, regardless of whether or not it is conducted for profit. Therefore, such records could conceivably include those of religious and charitable organizations, hospitals, schools, and even criminal organizations.\n\nThe basic rationale for the exception is that employees are under a duty to be accurate in observing, reporting, and recording business facts. The underlying belief is that special reliability is provided by the regularity with which the records are made and kept, as well as the incentive of employees to keep accurate records (under threat of termination or other penalty). The exception functions to allow the record to substitute for the in-court testimony of the employees, but it can only substitute for what the employee could testify about. The availability of the declarant (the employee whose testimony is being replaced by the record) is immaterial for the purposes of this exception.\n\nIt must be apparent to the judge that the record was made in the regular course of business, i.e., that it was customary practice to make such an entry and that the entrant had a duty to record it (either by law or by the terms of his employment). The record must have been made at or near the time of the act, event, or transaction at issue. Furthermore, the record must consist of matters either within the personal knowledge of the entrant or within the personal knowledge of someone with a duty to transmit the information to the entrant.\n\nThis last point was contested in the case of \"Johnson v. Lutz\", 253 N.Y. 124, 170 N.E. 517 (1930), which held that a business record is admissible only when it is made by an employee about information, obtained by him, from an informant who himself was under a business duty to impart that information. \"Johnson\" dealt specifically with the admissibility of police reports, and set a limitation on the use of such reports in court. Even though the police officer was under a duty to properly record the statements of an informant, the informant himself was under no duty to report the events correctly, and therefore the informant's statement was still inadmissible hearsay.\n\nIn the case of \"Palmer v. Hoffman\", , the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that an accident report created by a railroad company which was prepared in anticipation of a lawsuit by the victim was inadmissible, because it was not prepared in the regular course of business. Railroad travel, and not litigation, was the primary business of the railroad, and therefore the report was not considered sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence.\n\nFRE 803(7) states the negative counterpart of the business records exception: the use of the \"lack of a record\" to prove that a transaction or occurrence had not taken place, if it was the regular practice of the business to record such events if they had actually occurred.\n\nUnder FRE 803(17), market reports and quotations, directories, and other published compilations are considered generally admissible if they are generally used and relied upon by the public or by persons in particular occupations. Such information is considered admissible separate and apart from privately made business records described above.\n\n\n\n"}

Chambers of Edinburgh and became one of the most important English language encyclopaedias of the 19th and 20th centuries, developing a reputation for accuracy and scholarliness that was reflected in other works produced by the Chambers publishing company. The encyclopaedia is no longer produced. A selection of illustrations and woodblocks used to produce the first two editions of the encyclopaedia can be seen on a digital resource hosted on the National Museums Scotland website. \n\nThe first edition, titled \"Chambers's Encyclopaedia A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People\", was partly based on a translation into English of the 10th edition of the German-language \"Konversations-Lexikon\", which became the Brockhaus Enzyklopädie, however, the publishers found it necessary to include much additional material. Including more than 4000 illustrations not present in Brockhaus. Andrew Findlater was the acting editor and spent ten years on the project. The work appeared between 1859 and 1868 in 520 weekly parts at three-halfpence each and totalled ten octavo volumes, on 8,320 pages, and over 27,000 articles from over 100 authors. Volume 10 included a supplement of 409 pages at the back for new and revised content. A revised edition appeared in 1874. The index of matters not having special articles contained about 1,500 headings. The articles were generally excellent, especially on Jewish literature, folk-lore and practical science; but, as in Brockhaus, the scope of the work did not allow extended treatment.\n\nAn entirely new edition was published 1888–1892 in ten volumes edited by David Patrick. In this edition, the majority of the articles were rewritten and the articles on American matters were written mainly by Americans and an edition published there by Messrs. Lippincott of Philadelphia. This second edition had about 800 fewer illustrations than the first edition, although other visual features, such as tables and fold-out maps increased. See illustration styles of Chambers's Encyclopaedia page.\n\nFurther new editions appeared regularly, edited by Patrick, up to the First World War.\n\nThe last editions to keep to the original ten volume format were published under the editorship of William Geddie in 1923-27 and 1935.\n\nThe modern \"Chambers's\" was published in 15 volumes in 1950 by George Newnes and while being international in scope, has been described by \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" as British in orientation and conservative in approach with largely British contributors. The Managing Editor, Mrs M.D. Law, called it a completely new work with an historic name and noted in the preface that the encyclopaedia \"...is primarily a British production and therefore no doubt reflects to some extent the intellectual atmosphere of post-war Britain. This implies belief in international co-operation rather than nationalistic isolationism, and in freedom of speech, and worship, information and association rather than in any totalitarian conception\". The publication was celebrated at a luncheon at Grocer's Hall attended by over 100 contributors and which was chaired by Sir Frank Newnes. It was announced that the encyclopaedia, which had taken six years to prepare, had cost £500,000 and included the work of over 2,300 authors. Lord Jowitt, the Lord Chancellor, gave the toast and described the endeavor as \"outstanding proof\" of British scholarship, while Mrs Law commented that she believed the work to be the first major encyclopaedia to be published in Britain since before the First World War.\n\nSubsequent reports from the publishers, Newnes, confirmed that the work was a great success with sales requiring regular reprinting which also allowed for considerable revision of the work. By the 1961 revised edition, several million words had been revised or replaced and over half the total pages had been re-set or changed in some way. The encyclopaedia was regarded as such a scholarly achievement that Mrs Law received the O.B.E. for her efforts. She retired in 1963.\n\nThe 1966 edition was published by Pergamon who had purchased George Newnes' subscription books division.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In its initial format it appeared just four times – in 1817, 1822, 1829 and 1836, under the editorial direction of Richard Gilbert.\n\nAnother edition was actually advertised for 1838, but no copies have in fact been found within the main academic libraries.\n\nThe title was briefly revived by Thomas Bosworth & Company during the 1880s.\n\nThe main alphabetical section of the directory included:\n\n\nThe preliminary pages included:\n\n\nThe alphabetical list of benefices was also followed by an alphabetical list of the prelates, dignitaries and beneficed clergy of the Church of England (generally omitting the unbeneficed clergy).\n\nThe directories concluded with lists of ecclesiastical patronage, giving the names of those benefices within the gift of the king and also those of the lord chancellor, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, the various archbishops and bishops, and the two universities.\n\nThe 1817 edition stated that it was \"printed for J. C. & F. Rivington, 62 St Paul's Churchyard, by R. & R. Gilbert, St John's Square, Clerkenwell\". Richard Gilbert was a printer and an accountant with the SPCK. Although he appeared in the 1817 edition merely as the \"printer\" (alongside his brother Robert, who died the following year), he thereafter seems to have taken a more prominent role in its production. The 1822 edition was \"corrected by Richard Gilbert\", as though he had been engaged in putting right someone else's mistakes. He similarly wrote the prefaces for subsequent editions, and the 1836 edition still bore the names \"Gilbert and Rivington, printers, St John's Square\".\n\nGilbert, an industrious compiler who was additionally very active in the religious life of Clerkenwell, also produced a pocket-sized Clergyman's Almanack in 1819 \n\nThe failure of the directory to appear after 1836 left open an opportunity for a rival publication. This was filled after 1841 by the Clergy List.\n\nAfter lying dormant for fifty years, the title Clerical Guide and Ecclesiastical Directory was briefly revived in 1886 by Thomas Bosworth & Company, 65 Great Russell Street. Once again the volume offered alternative listings of the clergy and the benefices, together with other \"valuable information … from the office of the Ecclesiastical Commission. However the relaunched title was very quickly acquired by Hamilton Adams of Paternoster Row, who in 1889 merged it with their other recent acquisition, the aforementioned Clergy List.\n\nIn the issue for 1918/19 the Clergy List was merged in its turn with Crockford's Clerical Directory. Thereafter until the 1930s the latter title still continued to advertise on its preliminary pages that it \"incorporated the Clergy List\", together with the \"Clerical Guide and Ecclesiastical Directory\".\n\nA microfiche version of the 1829 directory was produced during the 1980s by the Society of Genealogists. In more recent years scanned copies of the early editions have also appeared on the World Wide Web.\n\n"}

In this attack, a malicious web page causes visitors to run a client-side script that attacks machines elsewhere on the network. In theory, the same-origin policy prevents this from happening: client-side scripts are only allowed to access content on the same host that served the script. Comparing domain names is an essential part of enforcing this policy, so DNS rebinding circumvents this protection by abusing the Domain Name System (DNS).\n\nThis attack can be used to breach a private network by causing the victim's web browser to access computers at private IP addresses and return the results to the attacker. It can also be employed to use the victim machine for spamming, distributed denial-of-service attacks, or other malicious activities.\n\nThe attacker registers a domain (such as attacker.com) and delegates it to a DNS server that is under the attacker's control. The server is configured to respond with a very short time to live (TTL) record, preventing the DNS response from being cached. When the victim browses to the malicious domain, the attacker's DNS server first responds with the IP address of a server hosting the malicious client-side code. For instance, they could point the victim's browser to a website that contains malicious JavaScript or Flash scripts that are intended to execute on the victim's computer.\n\nThe malicious client-side code makes additional accesses to the original domain name (such as attacker.com). These are permitted by the same-origin policy. However, when the victim's browser runs the script it makes a new DNS request for the domain, and the attacker replies with a new IP address. For instance, they could reply with an internal IP address or the IP address of a target somewhere else on the Internet.\n\nThe following techniques attempt to prevent DNS rebinding attacks:\n\n\n\n"}

They offered services such as free medical advice, basic First Aid and weekly weighing of babies.\n\nDoo's was originally built in 1886 as a tailor's shop. James Emile Doo traded from 1882 in a building across the road from 358, the business being taken over by his newly qualified son Harold Emile Doo, in about 1918. In 1929 Harold moved trading to their new premises at 358. The move was so carefully planned that dispensing was carried out until 10:00 p.m. on Saturday night in the old premises, and then started trading in the new premises the next morning at 9:00 a.m. Harold traded as a chemist until ill health forced his retirement in May 1968.\n\nThe shop lay untouched from 1968 to 1973, when the fittings and stock were donated to The Black Country Living Museum. The shop now located in The Black Country Living Museum is built using bricks reclaimed from two houses which were demolished in Pearson Street, Old Hill. The original shop front was also rescued and forms part of the exhibit today. The shop exhibition is much tidier than the shop would have been in real life. It would have been cluttered with hampers full of deliveries often leaving little room for customers.\n\nWith guidance from Emile Doo's daughter Betty, the shop has been laid out as it was shortly after the move across the road in 1929.\n\nThis was used for making thin soluble wafers for customers who needed medication dissolved in water. The prescribed ingredients were mixed to a paste with a binding agent and milk sugar. The mixture was then smeared over the top plate, which was flipped up so the wafers would slide into the bottom tray and could be dispensed via the extended section at the corner.\n\nBefore pills and tablets became widespread, prescribed medicine was mainly dispensed in the form of powders.\n\nThe practice continued in this century for things such as headache powders and infant teething powders. The ingredients were mixed together in a mortar and then individually wrapped in separate doses. The paper squares in which the powders were folded all had to be folded to the same dimensions so that they would fit neatly together into a box for the customer. The width of the paper could be adjusted using the ratchet mechanism on the side. The dose of powder was placed in the middle of a rectangular piece of white demi paper. The two edges were folded over to the width of the box, and then the paper strip was pressed over the folder to form two sharp creases. The two ends were brought together and one end pushed into the other forming a secure package. The folded doses were then put in a box or tied together to form a neat bundle.\n\nThe ingredients for the suppositories were melted into a base of cocoa butter or glycerine, and the mixture was brought to the boil and poured into the moulds. When the preparation was set (after about 30 minutes in cool weather) the two halves were unscrewed to release the suppositories.\n\nKnown locally as Jack, he was a well-known figure in Netherton, both through his work at The Chemist, and also for his involvement in amateur theatricals. He was a member of The 'Blue and Whites', a Pierrot troupe and did make up for other groups.\n\nIn the main, his life was dominated by the shop which was a focal point for local residents who needed minor treatment but could not afford doctors' fees. He had a considerable reputation for his own remedies. People came from far and wide to visit the shop. If you lived too far away to visit the shop, you could have your medicine delivered by post. He kept a book with all his remedies listed in, which his daughter still keeps today.\n\nHe qualified as a pharmacist in 1908. When he took the exam there were 133 candidates. 95 failed, with only 38 candidates achieving a pass. His certificate, and his father's, are on display.\n\nMr Doo suffered badly from arthritis, so could not move around easily. This may help explain why there was so much untouched stock in the cellar of the shop.\n\nLocals who remember him, described him as a white haired gentleman who whistled constantly through his teeth as he worked in the shop.\nHis dog Pip was a character too. The dog would come along to visit him during opening hours, having travelled alone by tram from Kinver to reach the shop.\n"}

The term second-generation consequently may refer to either the children or the grandchildren of such an immigrant. The terms are used interchangeably because of the ambiguity between them.\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Webster's Dictionary a \"First-generation\" is\n\nThe term first-generation, as it pertains to a person's nationality or residency in a country, has two incompatible meanings:\n\nThis ambiguity is captured and corroborated in \"The Oxford English Dictionary\"s definition of \"generation\":\n\nThere is no universal consensus on which of these meanings is always intended.\n\nThe term 1.5 generation or 1.5G refers to individuals who immigrate to a new country before or during their early teens. They earn the label the \"1.5 generation\" because they bring with them or maintain characteristics from their home country, meanwhile engaging in assimilation and socialization with their new country. Oftentimes, in the case of small children, a battle of linguistic comprehension occurs between their academic language and the language spoken at home. Their identity is, thus, a combination of new and old culture and tradition. Sociologist Ruben Rumbaut was among the first to use the term to examine outcomes among those arriving in the United States before adolescence, but since then the term has expanded to include foreign students, as well as other unique individuals.\n\nDepending on the age of immigration, the community where they settle, extent of education in their native country, and other factors, 1.5 generation individuals identify with their countries of origin to varying degrees. However, their identification is affected by their experiences growing up in the new country. 1.5G individuals are often bilingual and find it easier to assimilate into local culture and society than people who immigrate as adults.\nMany 1.5 generation individuals also, become bi-cultural, combining both cultures - culture from the country of origin with the culture of the new country.\n\nThe term \"second-generation\" extends the concept of \"first-generation\" by one generation. As such, the term exhibits the same type of ambiguity as \"first-generation,\" as well as additional ones.\n\nLike \"first-generation immigrant,\" the term \"second-generation\" can refer to a member of either:\n\nIn the United States, among demographers and other social scientists, \"second generation\" refers to the U.S.-born children of foreign-born parents.\n\nThe term \"second-generation immigrant\" attracts criticism due to it being an oxymoron. Namely, critics say, a \"second-generation immigrant\" is not an immigrant, since being \"second-generation\" means that the person is born in the country and the person's \"parents\" are the immigrants in question. Generation labeling immigrants is further complicated by the fact that immigrant generations may not correspond to the genealogical generations of a family. For instance, if a family of two parents and their two adult children immigrate to a new country, members in both generations of this family may be considered \"first generation\" by the former definition, as both parents and children were foreign-born, adult, immigrants. Likewise, if the two parents had a third child later on, this child would be of a different immigrant generation from that of its siblings. For every generation, the factor of mixed-generation marriages further convolutes the issue, as a person may have immigrants at several different levels of his or her ancestry.\n\nThese ambiguities notwithstanding, generation labeling is frequently used in parlance, news articles , and reference articles without deliberate clarification of birthplace or naturalization. It may or may not be possible to determine, from context, which meaning is intended.\n\nWhen demographers and other social scientists in the United States use the term \"second generation,\" they usually refer to people with one foreign-born parent. Likewise, Statistics Canada defines second generation persons as those individuals who were born in Canada and had at least one parent born outside\nCanada. Some researchers have begun to question whether those with one native-born parent and those with no native-born parents should be lumped together, with evidence suggesting that there are significant differences in identities and various outcomes between the two groups. For instance, patterns of ethnic identification with the majority ethnic group and the heritage ethnic group differ between the 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 generations, such that there is greater polarization between the two identities in the 1.0 generation (i.e., identifying as Canadian implies dis-identifying as a member of the heritage ethnic community and vice versa ), a lack of a relation between the two identities in the 2.0 generation, and a positive association between the two identities for the 2.5 generation (i.e., implying that the two identities are compatible and possibly hybridized) \n\nRubén G. Rumbaut has coined the terminology \"1.75 generation\" and \"1.25 generation\" immigrants, for children who are closer to birth or full adulthood when they immigrate. Children who arrive in their early childhood (ages 0 to 5) are referred to as 1.75 generation immigrants since their experiences are closer to a true 2nd-generation immigrant who was born in the country they live in: they retain virtually no memory of their country of birth, were too young to go to school to learn to read or write in the parental language in the home country, typically learn the language of the country they immigrate to without an accent and are almost entirely socialized there. Children who arrive in their adolescent years (ages 13–17) are referred to as 1.25 generation immigrants because their experiences are closer to the first generation of immigrants adults than to the native born second generation.\n\nMost immigrant youth tends to have higher academic accomplishment at all levels, at times even having greater levels of post-secondary education than their parents and grandparents. In order to explain this phenomenon, there are several factors that are noticeable:\n\nMany of these factors are reinforced and supported by the parents of immigrant youth who may have only immigrated in the first place in order to provide their children with a brighter future .\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "187432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187432", "title": "Imperial War Museum", "text": "Imperial War Museum\n\nImperial War Museums (IWM) is a British national museum organisation with branches at five locations in England, three of which are in London. Founded as the Imperial War Museum in 1917, the museum was intended to record the civil and military war effort and sacrifice of Britain and its Empire during the First World War. The museum's remit has since expanded to include all conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914. As of 2012, the museum aims \"to provide for, and to encourage, the study and understanding of the history of modern war and 'wartime experience'.\"\n\nOriginally housed in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham Hill, the museum opened to the public in 1920. In 1924, the museum moved to space in the Imperial Institute in South Kensington, and finally in 1936, the museum acquired a permanent home that was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Southwark. The outbreak of the Second World War saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference, but in the post-war period, the museum entered a period of decline. The 1960s saw the museum redevelop its Southwark building, now referred to as Imperial War Museum London, which serves as the organisation's corporate headquarters. During the 1970s, the museum began to expand onto other sites. The first, in 1976, was a historic airfield in Cambridgeshire now referred to as IWM Duxford. In 1978, the Royal Navy cruiser became a branch of the museum, having previously been preserved for the nation by a private trust. In 1984, the Cabinet War Rooms, an underground wartime command centre, was opened to the public. From the 1980s onwards, the museum's Bethlem building underwent a series of multimillion-pound redevelopments, completed in 2000. Finally, 2002 saw the opening of IWM North in Trafford, Greater Manchester, the fifth branch of the museum and the first in the north of England. In 2011, the museum rebranded itself as IWM, standing for \"Imperial War Museums\".\n\nThe museum's collections include archives of personal and official documents, photographs, film and video material, and oral history recordings, an extensive library, a large art collection, and examples of military vehicles and aircraft, equipment, and other artefacts.\n\nThe museum is funded by government grants, charitable donations, and revenue generation through commercial activity such as retailing, licensing, and publishing. General admission is free to IWM London (although specific exhibitions require the purchase of a ticket) and IWM North, but an admission fee is levied at the other branches. The museum is an exempt charity under the Charities Act 1993 and a non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. As of January 2012, the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards. Since October 2008, the museum's Director General has been Diane Lees.\n\nOn 27 February 1917 Sir Alfred Mond, a Liberal MP and First Commissioner of Works, wrote to the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to propose the establishment of a National War Museum. This proposal was accepted by the War Cabinet on 5 March 1917 and the decision announced in The Times on 26 March. A committee was established, chaired by Mond, to oversee the collection of material to be exhibited in the new museum.\n\nThis National War Museum Committee set about collecting material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, the production of munitions, and women's war work. There was an early appreciation of the need for exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway, the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must 'be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals'. The museum's first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes, who had previously been curator of the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London. In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and Field Marshal Haig, who reportedly took great interest in his work. In December 1917 the name was changed to the \"Imperial\" War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum.\n\nThe museum was opened by King George V at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond addressed the King on behalf of the committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one who took part in the war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice'. Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India, South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. While the Act was being debated, some Parliamentarians felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War'. On the August Bank Holiday 1920, the first public holiday since the museum's opening, 94,179 visitors were received, and by November 1921, 2,290,719 had visited the museum.\n\nIn 1924 the museum moved to the Imperial Institute building (demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to make way for Imperial College) in South Kensington. While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums, the accommodation itself proved cramped and inadequate and in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the River Thames in Southwark.\n\nThe building, designed by James Lewis was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital which had been vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by Lord Rothermere, who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely in order to provide a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear'. The 'distinguishing dome' was added by Sydney Smirke in 1846 and housed the hospital's chapel. The museum was reopened by the Duke of York (later King George VI) in its new accommodation on 7 July 1936.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict. In November 1939, during the so-called 'Phoney War', the museum appeared in the opening sequence of the GPO Film Unit production \"The First Days\", in which children are seen playing on some of the museum's German artillery pieces captured during the First World War. With the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk in May/June 1940, however, the British Army's shortage of equipment saw eighteen of the museum's artillery pieces return to military service. The museum's trench clubs were used by the Home Guard, while other items such as sights and optical instruments were returned to the Ministry of Supply. The museum refused, however, to return some historic items such as a naval gun from HMS \"Lance\" (which had fired Britain's first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by Victoria Cross-winning boy seaman Jack Cornwell. The museum initially remained open but was closed for the duration of the war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz. On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Seaplane, which had flown at the Battle of Jutland, was destroyed. While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school. In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department. These included the submarine fuel pipeline PLUTO, the fog dispersal method FIDO, and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier. However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946. A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949.\n\nIn 1953, with Commonwealth forces engaged in Korea and Malaya the museum began its current policy of collecting material from all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were involved. However, despite this expansion of remit, the early postwar period was a period of decline for the museum. Dr Noble Frankland, the museum's Director from 1960 to 1982, described the museum's galleries in 1955 as appearing 'dingy and neglected [and in a] dismal state of decay' the museum's 'numerous stunning exhibits' notwithstanding.\n\nIn 1966 the Museum's Southwark building was extended to provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since the Museum had moved to the site. The development also included a purpose-built cinema. In 1967 the museum acquired a pair of 15-inch naval guns. One had been mounted on the Royal Navy's HMS \"Ramillies\" and the other on both HMS \"Resolution\" and HMS \"Roberts\". Both had been fired in action during the Second World War. They went on permanent display outside the museum in May 1968. The acquisition of these guns, representative of the dreadnought era of British battleships, led the museum to seek to acquire a 6-inch triple turret that would be representative of a number of classes of British cruisers. This would eventually lead to the preservation of the Royal Navy light cruiser , which became a branch of the museum in 1978.\n\nLater in 1968 on 13 October the Museum was attacked by an arsonist, Timothy John Daly, who claimed he was acting in protest against the exhibition of militarism to children. He caused damage valued at approximately £200,000, not counting the loss of irreplaceable books and documents. On his conviction in 1969 he was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nIn 1969 RAF Duxford, a Royal Air Force fighter airfield in Cambridgeshire was declared surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence. Needing further space, the museum duly requested permission to use part of the site as temporary storage. The entire site was later transferred to the museum in February 1976 and Duxford, now referred to as Imperial War Museum Duxford became the museum's first branch. Also during the 1970s the government raised the possibility of the museum taking over the historic Cabinet War Rooms in Whitehall. The museum was reluctant due to its new commitments related to Duxford and HMS \"Belfast\", but agreed in 1982.\n\nBy 1983 the museum was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site and approached engineering firm Arup to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building's exhibition space, provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections, and improve facilities for visitors. The following year, in April 1984, the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public as a branch of the museum.\n\nThe first phase of the works to the Southwark building started in 1986 and were completed in 1989, during which time the museum was closed to the public. The work included the conversion of what was previously the hospital's courtyard into a centrepiece Large Exhibits Gallery. This gallery featured a strengthened ground floor (to support the weight of very heavy exhibits), a first floor mezzanine and second storey viewing balcony. Into this space were placed tanks, artillery pieces, vehicles, ordnance and aircraft from the First World War to the Falklands War. For some years the museum was marketed as \"The \"new\" Imperial War Museum\". This atrium, with its concentration of military hardware, has been described as \"the biggest boys' bedroom in London\". This first phase cost £16.7 million (of which £12 million was provided by the government) and the museum was reopened by The Queen on 29 June 1989.\nIn September 1992 the museum was the target of a Provisional Irish Republican Army attack against London tourist attractions. Two incendiary devices were found in a basement gallery, but were extinguished by staff before the arrival of the fire brigade, and caused only minor damage.\n\nThe second stage of the redevelopment of the Southwark building, during which the museum remained open to the public, was completed in 1994. During the 1990s, while these works were going on, the museum was also seeking to open a branch in the north of England. 71 sites were offered for consideration by 36 local councils and in January 1999 the then Culture Secretary Chris Smith formally launched a project to construct a new branch of the museum, Imperial War Museum North, in Trafford, Greater Manchester.\n\nThe following year, 2000, the final phase of the Southwark redevelopment was completed. The development included the installation of the museum's \"Holocaust Exhibition\" which was opened by the Queen on 6 June 2000. This was the first permanent exhibition dedicated to the Holocaust in a UK museum; its development had taken five years at a cost of £5 million. Two years later, in July 2002, Imperial War Museum North was opened.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2010 the museum was a partner in a national learning project entitled \"Their Past Your Future\" (TPYF), part of the Big Lottery Fund's Veterans Reunited programme to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. A partnership between the IWM, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, and Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh museum authorities, phase one included a touring exhibition seen by more than two million people, overseas educational visits and further activities run by local authorities. A second phase took a wider 20th century historical remit; it comprised a learning programme using overseas visits and social media, and a professional development scheme for educators. A digital archive of the project, online exhibitions and learning resources were also produced.\n\nIn October 2011 the museum rebranded itself as Imperial War Museums, the initials IWM forming the basis of a new corporate logo.\n\nIn September 2011 the museum secured funding from NESTA, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Arts Council England to develop \"social interpretation\" systems to allow visitors to comment on, collect, and share museum objects via social media. These systems were incorporated in \"A Family in Wartime\", an exhibition at IWM London depicting British family life during the Second World War, which opened in April 2012.\n\nIn August 2009 the Museum announced the creation of the Imperial War Museum Foundation. Chaired by Jonathon Harmsworth the foundation was charged with raising funds to support the redevelopment of Imperial War Museum London's permanent galleries. In December 2010 plans were announced to redevelop IWM London's First World War gallery in time for the conflict's centenary in 2014, and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge became the foundation's patron. In a speech at IWM London on 11 October 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron announced an additional £5 million of government funding to support the museum's redevelopment, as part of funding arrangements to facilitate national centenary commemorations. The £40 million redevelopment, designed by Foster and Partners, provides new gallery spaces dedicated to the history of the First World War, a new central hall, easier navigation and improved visitor facilities, access and circulation. In preparation for building work, a number of galleries were closed during September 2012, and by December 2012 over sixty large objects had been removed from the IWM London atrium for conservation at Duxford. To allow building work to go ahead, IWM London closed to the public on 2 January 2013. The museum partially reopened on 29 July 2013.\n\nIWM London was formally reopened on 17 July 2014 by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards the Imperial War Museum began to expand onto other sites. The first branch, Imperial War Museum Duxford opened to the public on a regular basis in June 1976. HMS Belfast became a branch of the museum in 1978. The Cabinet War Rooms opened in 1984, and Imperial War Museum North in 2002.\n\nThe museum has occupied the former Bethlem Royal Hospital on Lambeth Road since 1936. The hospital building was designed by the hospital surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by John Gandy and other architects, and construction completed in October 1814. The hospital consisted of a range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to Lambeth Road, with a central entrance under a portico.\n\nThe building was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In order to provide more space, he added blocks at either end of the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.\n\nThe building remained substantially unchanged until vacated by the hospital in 1930. After the freehold was purchased by Lord Rothermere, the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 the ground floor of the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to Sir William Orpen and Sir John Lavery), a gallery on women's war work, and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the map collection and stored pictures and drawings. This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II listed building status.\n\nThe original hospital building is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000 m of gallery space of which 4,600 m was new, and the second provided a further 1,600 m. The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and provided 5,860m of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors. Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, \"Secret War\", exploring special forces, espionage and covert operations. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent \"Crimes against Humanity\" exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent \"Holocaust Exhibition\", and the fourth floor, a vaulted roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's Victoria Cross (VC) and George Cross collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by Michael Ashcroft, 241 medals in total.\n\nIn 1989 the museum acquired the All Saints Annexe, a former hospital building in Austral Street off West Square. The 1867 building, which backs onto Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, was originally an orphanage opened by local philanthropist Charlotte Sharman, then later used as a hospital. It houses the museum's photographic, film and sound archives, and offices.\n\nImperial War Museum Duxford, near the village of Duxford in Cambridgeshire, is Britain's largest aviation museum. Duxford houses the museum's large exhibits, including nearly 200 aircraft, military vehicles, artillery and minor naval vessels in seven main exhibitions buildings. The site also provides storage space for the museum's collections of film, photographs, documents, books and artefacts. The site accommodates a number of British Army regimental museums, including those of the Parachute Regiment and the Royal Anglian Regiment.\n\nBased on the historic Duxford Aerodrome, the site was originally operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the First World War. During the Second World War Duxford played a prominent role during the Battle of Britain and was later used by United States Army Air Forces fighter units in support of the daylight bombing of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. Many of Duxford's original buildings, such as hangars used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. A number of these buildings are of architectural or historic significance and over thirty have listed building status. The site also features a number of purpose-built exhibition buildings, such as the Stirling Prize-winning American Air Museum, designed by Sir Norman Foster. The site remains an active airfield and is used by a number of civilian flying companies, and hosts regular air shows. The site is operated in partnership with Cambridgeshire County Council and the Duxford Aviation Society, a charity formed in 1975 to preserve civil aircraft and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history.\n\n HMS \"Belfast\", a Town class cruiser, was launched in 1938 and served throughout the Second World War, participating in the December 1943 Battle of North Cape and firing some of the first shots of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. She saw further combat in the Korean War. Expected to be disposed of as scrap after she was decommissioned in 1963, in 1967 efforts were initiated to preserve \"Belfast\" as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence was established, and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971 the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS \"Belfast\" Trust to campaign for her to be saved for the nation. The Trust was successful in its efforts, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London. Opened to the public in October 1971 \"Belfast\" became a branch of the Imperial War Museum on 1 March 1978, being acknowledged by the then Secretary of State for Education and Science, Shirley Williams, as \"a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology\". In service for 24 years HMS \"Belfast\" was in Frankland's opinion, capable of representing \"a whole generation of [historical evidence]\".\n\nIn 2017, the name of the exhibit was changed to \"HMS \"Belfast\" 1938\" to reflect that one of the Royal Navy's new Type 26 frigates had been given the name HMS \"Belfast\".\n\nThe Cabinet War Rooms is an underground complex that served as a British government command centre throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan. Their historical value was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30–40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted. The museum agreed to take over the administration of the site in 1982, a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Thatcher opened the War Rooms in April 1984. In 2003 a further suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. In 2005 the War Rooms were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms, with 850 m of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The development of the Churchill Museum cost a further £6 million. The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an \"electronic filing cabinet\". The museum was renamed the Churchill War Rooms in 2010.\n\nThe Imperial War Museum North was opened in Trafford, Greater Manchester in 2002. It was the first branch of the museum outside southeast England, and the first to be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind's building, overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal at Salford Quays, was based on the concept of a globe shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled. These shards, representing earth, air and water, give the building its shape. Originally budgeted at £40 million, the museum was eventually completed for £28.5 million after anticipated funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies, by private donations and by Peel Holdings, a local transport and property company which contributed £12.5 million.\n\nThe museum's first floor main gallery space houses the permanent exhibitions. These consist of a chronological display which runs around the gallery's 200m perimeter and six thematic displays in \"silos\" within the space. The walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of an hourly audiovisual presentation, the Big Picture. The main gallery, described as cavernous and dramatic, includes objects such as a Russian T-34 tank, a United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier jet, and a British 13-pounder field gun which fired the British Army's first shot of the First World War. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions, mounted in a separate gallery.\n\nThe Imperial War Museum's original collections date back to the material amassed by the National War Museum Committee. The present departmental organisation came into being during the 1960s as part of Frankland's reorganisation of the museum. The 1970s saw oral history gain increasing prominence and in 1972 the museum created the Department of Sound Records (now the Sound Archive) to record interviews with individuals who had experienced the First World War. The museum maintains an online database of its collections.\n\nThe museum's documents archive seeks to collect and preserve the private papers of individuals who have experienced modern warfare. The archive's holdings range from the papers of senior British and Commonwealth army, navy and air officers, to the letters, diaries and memoirs of lower-ranked servicemen and of civilians. The collection includes the papers of Field Marshals Bernard Montgomery, and Sir John French. The archive also includes large collections of foreign documents, such as captured German Second World War documents previously held by the Cabinet Office Historical Section, Air Historical Branch and other British government bodies. The foreign collection also includes captured Japanese material transferred from the Cabinet Office. The collection also includes files on Victoria and George Cross recipients, and correspondence relating to the BBC documentary \"The Great War\". The documents collection also includes the UK National Inventory of War Memorials. In 2012 the museum reported its documents collection to contain 24,800 collections of papers.\n\nThe museum's art collection includes paintings, prints, drawings, sculpture, and works in film, photography and sound. The collection originated during the First World War, when the museum acquired works that it had itself commissioned, as well as works commissioned by the Ministry of Information's British War Memorials Committee. As early as 1920 the art collection held over 3,000 works and included pieces by John Singer Sargent, Wyndham Lewis, John Nash and Christopher Nevinson. Notable First World War works include Sargent's \"Gassed\" and other works commissioned for an, unbuilt, Hall of Remembrance. The collection expanded again after the Second World War, receiving thousands of works sponsored by the Ministry of Information's War Artists' Advisory Committee. In 1972 the museum established the Artistic Records Committee (since renamed the Art Commissions Committee) to commission artists to cover contemporary conflicts. Commissioned artists include Ken Howard, Linda Kitson, John Keane, Peter Howson, Steve McQueen (see \"Queen and Country\") and Langlands & Bell, responding to conflicts in Northern Ireland, the Falklands, the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. The collection also includes over twenty thousand items of publicity material such as posters, postcards, and proclamations from both world wars, and more recent material such as posters issued by anti-war organisations such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Stop the War Coalition. The museum's collection is represented in digital resources such as the Visual Arts Data Service (VADS), and Google Art Project. In 2012 the museum reported the total size of its art collection as 84,980 items.\n\nThe museum's Film and Video Archive is one of the oldest film archives in the world. The archive preserves a range of historically significant film and video material, including the official British film record of the First World War. Notable among the archive's First World War holdings is \"The Battle of the Somme\", a pioneering 1916 documentary film (which was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2005), and \"Der Magische Gürtel\", a German 1917 propaganda film about the submarine \"U-35\". The archive's Second World War holdings include unedited film shot by British military cameramen, which document combat actions such as the British landings on D-Day in June 1944, and the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. The archive also holds government information films and propaganda features such as \"Target for Tonight\" and \"Desert Victory\". The archive's post-Second World War collections include material from the Korean War, Cold War material, the former film library of NATO, and material produced by the United Nations UNTV service in Bosnia. As an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, the archive continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. The archive also seeks to acquire amateur film taken by both service personnel and civilian cameramen. Material from the collection was used to make a number of well-known TV documentary series including \"The Great War\" and \"The World at War\". In 2012 the museum reported the size of its film archive as being in excess of 23,000 hours of film, video and digital footage.\n\nThe museum's Photograph Archive preserves photographs by official, amateur and professional photographers. The collection includes the official British photographic record of the two world wars; the First World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Ernest Brooks and John Warwick Brooke. The archive also holds 150,000 British aerial photographs from the First World War, the largest collection of its kind. The Second World War collection includes the work of photographers such as Bill Brandt, Cecil Beaton and Bert Hardy. Like the Film Archive, the Photograph Archive is an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, and as such continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its photographic holdings as approximately 11 million images in 17,263 collections.\n\nThe museum's exhibits collection includes a wide range of objects, organised into numerous smaller collections such as uniforms, badges, insignia and flags (including a Canadian Red Ensign carried at Vimy Ridge in 1917, a Union flag from the 1942 British surrender of Singapore, and another found among the wreckage of the World Trade Center following the September 11 attacks); personal mementoes, souvenirs and miscellanea such as trench art; orders, medals and decorations (including collections of Victoria and George Crosses); military equipment; firearms and ammunition, ordnance, edged weapons, clubs (such as trench clubs) and other weapons, and vehicles, aircraft and ships. The museum holds the national collection of modern firearms. The firearms collection includes a rifle used by T. E. Lawrence, and an automatic pistol owned by Winston Churchill. The ordnance collection includes artillery pieces that participated in notable battles, such as the Néry gun, a field gun that was used during the 1914 action at Néry, and equipment captured from enemy forces. The museum's vehicles collection includes \"Ole Bill\", a bus used by British forces in the First World War, and a number of vehicles used by Field Marshal Montgomery during the Second World War. The museum's aircraft collection includes aircraft that are notable for their rarity, such as the only complete and original Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in existence and one of only two surviving TSR-2 strike aircraft, and aircraft associated with particular actions, such as a Supermarine Spitfire flown during the Battle of Britain. The museum's naval collection includes HM Coastal Motor Boat 4 and a midget submarine HMS XE8. In 2012 the museum reported its exhibits collection to contain 155,000 objects and a further 357 vehicles and aircraft.\n\nThe museum's library is a national reference collection on modern conflict, and holds works on all aspects of warfare, including regimental or unit histories (such as 789 rare German unit histories from the First World War), technical manuals, biographical material and works on war's social, cultural, economic, political and military aspects. The library also holds printed ephemera such as the Imperial War Museum Stamp Collection, leaflets and ration books, printed proclamations, newspapers, trench magazines (such the \"Wipers Times\") and trench maps. In 2012 the museum reported its library collection to contain over 80,000 items of historic importance (such as maps, proclamations and rare books) and a further 254,000 items of reference material.\n\nThe museum's Sound Archive holds 33,000 sound recordings, including a large collection of oral history recordings of witnesses to conflicts since 1914. The museum's sound collection originated in 1972 with the creation of the Department of Sound Records and the instigation of an oral history recording programme. The sound collection opened to the public in July 1977. The collection also includes recordings made by the BBC during the Second World War, actuality sound effects, broadcasts, speeches and poetry. As part of the museum's First World War centenary programme, the museum is producing \"Voices of the First World War\", a podcast series drawing upon the museum's oral history recordings. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its sound collection as 37,000 hours.\n\nThe IWM has an online database, listing the various items which make up the IWM Collections. In some cases, there are images of the item, or contemporary photos, which can be shared and reused under a Creative Commons Licence.\n\nThe War Memorials Register is a database of known war memorials in the United Kingdom. Information material used in composition, the condition of the memorial, its address and coordinates with a satellite map plot are recorded for each of the memorials. There are over 70,000 memorials on the register. Whilst many memorials are commemorated to those who died in the First World War, the scope of the project is all conflicts.\n\nIn 2014, IWM and online genealogy service provider Findmypast entered into a collaboration to launch the \"Lives of the First World War\" platform. During the centenary period, anyone can sign up for an account. Those who pay for a subscription have the ability to add records from Findmypast's collections.\n\nA number of sources (War Office medal index cards, Canadian Expeditionary Force attestations, Royal Navy service records etc.) have been used as seeding documents to create individual entries in the database. Each entry in the database - known as a Life Story - can be further built up, so as to document when that person was born, when they died, family members etc. If a Life Story needs to be added, or a duplicate exists that needs to be merged, this can be requested via a support forum manned by IWM volunteers. A user with a subscription has the ability to group Life Stories together into a \"Community\". This could be a grouping based around a ship's crew, a unit in the army, or the names of men and women buried in a given war cemetery.\n\nThe goal has been to encourage crowdsourcing to build up as many details as possible in the database, and to tap into the popularity of online genealogy as a pastime. One selling point of the platform has been that it is a \"permanent digital memorial [that] will be saved for future generations.\" The IWM has declared that the data from the platform will become part of its archive when the platform ceases to be interactive in 2019, 'and will be free to access online for research.' \n\nThe Imperial War Museum is an executive non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, from which it receives financial support in the form of a grant-in-aid. The governance of the museum is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, originally established by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920, later amended by the Imperial War Museum Act 1955 and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 and other relevant legislation. The board comprises a president (currently Prince Edward, Duke of Kent) who is appointed by the sovereign, and fourteen members appointed in varying proportions by the Prime Minister, and the Foreign, Defence, and Culture Secretaries. Seven further members are Commonwealth High Commissioners appointed \"ex officio\" by their respective governments. As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is Sir Francis Richards and his deputy is Lieutenant-General Sir John Kiszely. Past chairmen have included Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin (1967–77), Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon Willis and Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Grandy (trustee 1971–78, Chairman 1978–89). During the Second World War Grandy had commanded RAF Duxford, and was chairman during the planning of Duxford's American Air Museum, which opened in 1997.\n\nThe museum's Director-General is answerable to the trustees and acts as accounting officer. Since 1917 the museum has had six directors. The first was Sir Martin Conway, a noted art historian, mountaineer and explorer. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts to map the Karakoram mountain range of the Himalayas, and was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of Cambridge from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of Director until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley. Bradley had served in the First World War in the Middlesex Regiment before being invalided out in 1917. He later became acquainted with Charles ffoulkes, who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum's poster collection. Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr Noble Frankland. Frankland had served as a navigator in RAF Bomber Command, winning a Distinguished Flying Cross. While a Cabinet Office official historian he co-authored a controversial official history of the RAF strategic air campaign against Germany. Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr Alan Borg who had previously been at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts. In 1995 Borg moved to the Victoria and Albert Museum and was succeeded by Sir Robert Crawford, who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968. Upon Crawford's retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by Diane Lees, previously Director of the V&A Museum of Childhood. She was noted in the media as the first woman appointed to lead a British national museum.\n"}

The IEUS was conceived at the Mundaneum Institute in The Hague in the 1930s, and published in the United States beginning in 1938. It was an ambitious project that was never completed.\n\nThe IEUS was an output of the Vienna Circle to address the \"growing concern throughout the world for the logic, the history, and the sociology of science...\" Only the first section \"Foundations of the Unity of Science\" (FUS) was published; it contains two volumes for a total of nineteen monographs published from 1938 to 1969.\n\nCreation of the IEUS was facilitated by the International Congresses for the Unity of Science organized by members of the Vienna Circle. After a preliminary conference in Prague in 1934, the First International Congress for the Unity of Science was held at the Sorbonne, Paris, 16–21 September 1935. It was attended by about 170 people from over twenty different countries. With the active involvement of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (Poland), Susan Stebbing (England), and Federigo Enriques (Italy) the scope of the project for an IEUS was considerably expanded. The congress expressed its approval of the planned IEUS as proposed by the Mundaneum, and further set up a committee to plan future congresses. This committee included the following members:\nThe Third International Congress for the Unity of Science, which was devoted exclusively to the IEUS, was held in Paris, 29–31 July 1937.\n\nEncyclopedia and Unified Science (FUS I-1)<br>\nOtto Neurath, Niels Bohr, John Dewey, Bertrand Russell, Rudolf Carnap, and Charles Morris\n\nFoundations of the Theory of Signs (FUS I-2)<br>\nCharles Morris\n\nFoundations of Logic and Mathematics (FUS I-3)<br>\nRudolf Carnap\n\nLinguistic Aspects of Science (FUS I-4)<br>\nLeonard Bloomfield\n\nProcedures of Empirical Science (FUS I-5)<br>\nVictor F.

Hollinger noted that the \"Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences\", published around the same time, provided a much more comprehensive account of the social sciences: \"\"The Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences\" (12 vols., New York, 1933–1937) was a prodigious endeavor brought to successful completion by Alvin Johnson. This encyclopedia is a much more important episode in the history of thought than \"The International Encyclopedia of Unified Science\" yet has attracted much less attention from historians than the abortive enterprise led by Neurath.\" Hollinger also said that the scholarly journal \"Philosophy of Science\", founded in 1934, provided a much more inclusive perspective on the sciences in those years than did the IEUS.\n\nAmerican political theorist James Burnham refers to the Encyclopedia in \"Science and Style: A Reply to Comrade Trotsky\" (1940), his penultimate tract discussing his differences with Leon Trotsky and marking Burnham's renouncement of dialectical materialism. In this text he responds to Trotsky's request to draw his attention to \"those works which should supplant the system of dialectic materialism for the proletariat\" by referring to \"Principia Mathematica\" by Russell and Whitehead and \"the scientists, mathematicians and logicians now cooperating in the new Encyclopedia of Unified Science\".\n\n\n"}

He became a Licentiate in Law (I.U.L. or J.U.L. = Juris Utriusque Licentiatus) at the University of Giessen in 1786 and shortly afterwards took up residence in Hamburg where he remained for the rest of his life. He was a prolific writer in the contemporary press, but is best remembered for a number of encyclopaedic dictionaries and travel reports which he wrote and published over the following thirty years.\n\nThe first of these was his \"Allgemeines Polyglotten-Lexicon der Natur-Geschichte\" (\"Universal polyglot dictionary of natural history\"). It takes the form of a list of German terms in all branches of natural history with their corresponding terms in eight other European languages. It was published in parts, comprising in all about 2,400 pages, between 1793 and 1798. With the exception of the first part, all were published by Nemnich himself, a practice that he was frequently to adopt with subsequent publications. This was followed by a commercial dictionary in twelve languages, the \"Waaren-lexicon\" (\"Dictionary of wares\") of 1797-1802. In parallel with the German edition an English version (for which subscriptions were solicited in the press in 1796) was also prepared for the British market and published in December 1798.\n\nIn 1799 Nemnich undertook the first of his two visits to Britain during both of which he was particularly concerned with its trade and industries. His original object had been to collect material for a series of articles in the \"Allgemeine Zeitung\", the newspaper that had been started the previous year by the Tübingen printer and publisher, Johann Friedrich Cotta. As it turned out, however, his visit provided him with enough material for a book of over 500 pages. It was published by Cotta in 1800 as \" Beschreibung einer im Sommer 1799 von Hamburg nach u. durch England geschehenen Reise\" (\"Description of a journey made in the summer of 1799 from Hamburg to and through England\").\n\nTwo further polyglot dictionaries followed, the \"Lexicon nosologicum polyglotton omnium morborum … \", a medical dictionary in ten languages, published by Nemnich himself in 1801, and the \"Comtoir-Lexicon in Neun Sprachen\" of 1803. Again, an English version of the latter was prepared; it was printed in Hamburg and published in 1803 as \"Counting house lexicon in nine languages\".\n\nNemnich paid a second visit to Britain in 1805-06. He was better prepared this time with 1,200 letters of introduction and had publicly invited the submission of questions on matters which could usefully be investigated. This visit resulted in his \"Neueste Reise durch England, Schottland, und Ireland, hauptsächlich in Bezug auf Produkte, Fabriken, und Handlung\" (\"Recent journeys through England, Scotland and Ireland, especially in connection with products, works and commerce\"). Despite the title of the book, Nemnich also took in Wales where he was obviously fascinated by the Welsh language. Like the earlier account of his British travels, this too was published by Cotta in 1807.\n\nIn 1808 he made the first of several similar journeys during the course of which he investigated the industries of the Netherlands, France, Italy and Switzerland. His findings appeared in a series of eight volumes as \"Tagebuch einer der Kultur und Industrie gewidmeten Reise\" (\"Diary of a journey devoted to culture and industry\") with publication by Cotta spread over the years 1809-11.\n\nNemnich continued to produce several more dictionaries including his \"Britische Waaren-Encyklopädie\" which also appeared in an English version as \"Encyclopaedia of merchandise: comprising all the exports and imports of Great-Britain, her colonies and America\", both published by Nemnich himself in Hamburg in 1815. This was followed by a German-English/English-German dictionary of commercial correspondence, \"Universal-Lexicon der Englischen und Deutschen Handlungs-Correspondenz\", which also appeared in both German and English versions and was published in 1816. In 1820 a new edition of his \"Waaren-Lexicon\" appeared, the \"Neues Waaren-Lexicon in zwölf Sprachen\".\n\nIn 1819 Nemnich was appointed to a post in Hamburg as censor of literature intended for children and women and this seems to have brought an end to his prolific writing career. He is known to have produced only one further work which was a translation published in 1820 of Sir John Ross's \"Voyage of discovery ... in H.M.S. Isabella and Alexander, for the purpose of exploring Baffin's Bay and inquiring into the probability of a north-west passage\" (originally published, London, 1819). He died in Hamburg in 1822.\n\nNemnich was a compulsive observer and collector of facts but he lacked depth and originality and the ability to analyse his facts. His visits to Britain and other European countries reveal him in this light rather than as an industrial spy or as a political economist. He was obviously a natural linguist, a gift which he put to good use in his various polyglot dictionaries.\n\n\"Allgemeines Polyglotten-Lexicon der Natur-Geschichte mit erklaerenden Anmerkungen.

The village was under the control of a coalition of Islamist rebels, when a Tunisian commander of one group in the coalition, the al-Nusra Front, tried to confiscate the house of one of the villagers who they accused of working for the Syrian government. The villagers protested and there were two different accounts of what followed. According to anti-government activists, the Nusra fighters opened fire on the protesting villagers, after the Tunisian commander accused them of blasphemy. In contrast, Nusra member Mohammad Feezo claimed it was the villagers who opened fire first. In the end, the al-Nusra Front killed 20 people, including the elderly and a child. The Druze were reported to have killed three members of al-Nusra Front, including the Tunisian. Two days later, a report put the number of Druze killed at 24.\n\nThe massacre sparked widespread condemnation in neighbouring Lebanon, which has a considerable Druze minority. Walid Jumblatt responded that \"Any inciting rhetoric will not be beneficial, and you should remember that Bashar Assad’s policies pushed Syria into this chaos\". In contrast, the Lebanese Druze party chief and former government minister Wiam Wahhab urged the Druze to form an armed force to defend their community in an angry televised speech saying “We will not accept to sell Druze blood!“. His call was much in line with that of the Syrian Druze spiritual leader who directed the Druze to join the Syrian Army. Subsequently, Druze fighters from Sweida assisted the Syrian Army in recapturing an airbase from the Nusra Front. Prior to the Qalb Loze killings, Nusra had forced hundreds of Druze to convert to Sunni Islam, as well as desecrating their graves and destroying shrines. On June 22, a group of Druze lynched a wounded Syrian in the Golan Heights who was being transported to Israel for treatment, as they believed him to be a rebel fighter.\n\n"}

Civilian prefixes are often used inconsistently, and frequently not at all. Sometimes a slash is used to separate the letters, as in \"M/S\".\n\nNaval prefixes came into use as abbreviations for longer titles, such as \"His/Her Majesty's Ship\" in the British Royal Navy, abbreviated \"H.M.S.\" and then \"HMS\". Earlier uses often included the type of vessel, as for instance \"U.S.F.\" (\"United States Frigate\") for frigates of the United States Navy, that were eliminated by President Theodore Roosevelt's Executive order #549 of 1907 making \"United States Ship\" (USS) the standard for the Navy's commissioned ships while in commission. In the United States Navy that prefix officially only applies while the ship is in active commission, with only the name used before or after a period of commission and for all vessels \"in service\" rather than commissioned status. Today the common practice is to use a single prefix for all warships of a nation's navy, and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services, such as coast guards.\n\nThe use of ship prefixes is not universal; in particular neither the German \"Kriegsmarine\" nor the Imperial Japanese Navy used ship prefixes, though the suffix \"Maru\" meaning \"circle\" is common for most Japanese civilian vessels. Some English-language writers use prefixes like \"DKM\" (for \"Deutsche Kriegsmarine\") and \"HIJMS\" (for \"His Imperial Japanese Majesty's Ship\") or \"IJN\" (for \"Imperial Japanese Navy\", a translation of 大日本帝国海軍 \"dai-nippon teikoku kaigun\") for consistency with \"HMS\" and \"USS\". Other writers follow the practice of the navy and omit any prefix.\n\nFrom the 20th century onwards, most navies identify ships by hull numbers (pennant numbers)—identification codes typically painted on the side of the ship. Each navy has its own system: the United States Navy uses hull classification symbols, and the Royal Navy and other navies of Europe and the Commonwealth use pennant numbers.\n\nThese tables list both current and historical prefixes known to have been used.\n\nThese prefixes are generally used for merchant vessels of any nationality.\n\nThe designations for United Kingdom ships applied at the time of the British Empire, before the establishment of separate navies for the Dominions.\n\nIn the Royal Netherlands Navy, \"HNLMS\" is the prefix in English, a translation of the Dutch original \"Hr.Ms.\" or \"Zr.Ms.\". \"Hr.Ms.\" should preferably not be used in English-language documents; nevertheless it is often seen on the World Wide Web. Until the moment a Dutch naval ship officially enters active service in the fleet, the ship's name is used without the prefix. Since King Willem-Alexander succeeded Queen Beatrix on 30 April 2013, \"Hr.Ms.\" is replaced by \"Zr.Ms.\".\n\nIn Australia, the prefix NUSHIP is used to denote ships that have yet to be commissioned into the fleet.\n\nIn the United States, all prefixes other than \"USS\", \"USNS\", \"USNV\", and \"USRC\" were made obsolete in 1901, when President Theodore Roosevelt issued an Executive order fixing American naval nomenclature. USRC was replaced by USCGC when the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the United States Lifesaving Service to become the United States Coast Guard in 1915. USLHT also was replaced by USCGC when the United States Lighthouse Service became a part of the U.S. Coast Guard in 1939. USC&GS was replaced by NOAAS when the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey merged with other U.S. Government scientific agencies to form the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1970.\n\nA United States Navy ship that is not in active commission does not hold the title of United States Ship with simply the name without prefix used before and after commissioned service. Vessels, such as yard and harbor craft that are not commissioned and \"in service\" are officially referred to by name or hull number without prefix. Military Sealift Command (MSC) civilian manned ships \"in service\" are given the prefix United States Naval Ship (USNS). \nPrior to commissioning, ships may be described as a pre-commissioning unit or PCU; for example, the uncommissioned has been described as the \"pre-commissioning unit (PCU) \"Gerald R. Ford\".\" However, the vessel's official name is \"Gerald R. Ford\" without any prefix, and will be known as USS \"Gerald R. Ford\" once commissioned.\n\nWhen it is stricken from the fleet list, a ship typically has the prefix \"ex-\" added to its name, to distinguish it from any active ships bearing the same name. For example, after USS \"Constellation\" (CV-64) was retired in 2003, she became referred to as ex-\"Constellation\".\n\nNote that while calling a US ship \"the USS \"Flattop\"\" may make grammatical sense, the preliminary article \"the\" is discouraged by nearly all style guides, and the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy uses ship names without article, except for USS \"The Sullivans\", named for the five Sullivan brothers, all lost at sea during World War II. Its British equivalent (\"the HMS \"Flattop\"\") is also discouraged, since \"the Her Majesty's Ship\" would be grammatically incorrect.\n\nYugoslavia war navy had strict naming rules and ships prefix that was driven by order by President of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1969. After dissolution of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia new state Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continued same naming convention for War navy of Yugoslavia Armed Forces from 1992 to 2003.\n\nFictional equivalents of tri-letter prefixes frequently appear in English-language science fiction works, applied to seafaring and spaceborne ships alike. See also Space navy for similar adoption of naval customs for fictional spacefaring military organizations.\n\n"}

Several of the paintings had been in the Hermitage Collection since its creation by Empress Catherine the Great. About 250 paintings were sold, including masterpieces by Jan van Eyck, Titian, Rembrandt, Rubens, Raphael, and other important artists. Andrew Mellon donated the twenty-one paintings he purchased from the Hermitage to the United States government in 1937, which became the nucleus of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the late 1920s, the Soviet government urgently needed foreign currency to finance the rapid industrialization of Russia ordered in the first Five Year Plan. The government had already sold off collections of jewelry, furniture and icons seized from the Russian nobility, wealthy classes, and the church.\n\nIn February 1928, the State Hermitage Museum in Leningrad, along with the Russian Museum, was ordered to make a list of art works worth at least two million rubles, for export. A special agency called 'Antiquariat' was created under the \"Narkompros\" (the People's Commisariat of Enlightenment) and opened an office in Leningrad to oversee the sale. The Hermitage was instructed to sell 250 paintings for at least 5000 rubles each, plus engravings and a number of golden treasures from ancient Scythia.\n\nThe sale was secret, but word was quietly spread to selected western art dealers and collectors that the paintings were on the market.\n\nThe first foreign buyer to purchase Hermitage paintings was Calouste Gulbenkian, the founder of the Iraq Petroleum Company, who began buying paintings in early 1930, trading them for oil with the Russians. These works later formed part of the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, in Lisbon. However, the organizers of the sale were dissatisfied with the amounts they received from Gulbenkian, so they looked for other buyers.\nAndrew Mellon was an American banker, Secretary of the Treasury for Presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, art collector and, at the time, American Ambassador to Great Britain. He conceived the idea of founding a National Gallery for the United States modeled after the National Gallery (London). He heard about the secret Hermitage sale from Knoedler and Company of New York, dealers which he regularly used for his art purchases.\n\nFranz Zatzenstein-Matthiesen, a young German art dealer, had been asked by the Soviet Government to compile a list of the hundred paintings in Russian collections, which should never be sold under any circumstances. He was surprised soon afterwards to find several of the paintings on his list were in Paris, purchased by Gulbenkian. Gulbenkian asked him to act as his agent on further purchases, but Matthiesen instead formed a consortium with Colnaghi's of London and with Mellon's firm, Knoedler. In 1930 and 1931 the consortium bought twenty-one paintings from the Soviet government, which they offered to Mellon, who had the right of first refusal. By the end of 1931, Mellon had acquired twenty-one paintings for a total price of $6,654,000. They included Van Eyck's \"Annunciation\" and Raphael's \"The Alba Madonna\". The latter painting was sold for $1,166,400, the largest sum ever paid for a single painting until that time. The consortum sold several other paintings to other clients, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\nThe sale remained secret until November 4, 1933, when it was reported in the \"New York Times\" that several Hermitage paintings, including the \"Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych\" by van Eyck, had been purchased by the Metropolitan Museum..\n\nThe sales came to an end in 1934, possibly as a result of a letter to Stalin from the deputy director of the Hermitage, Joseph Orbeli, protesting the sale of Russia's treasures. The director of the Hermitage, Boris Legran, who had been brought to the museum to conduct the sale, was dismissed in 1934 and replaced by Orbeli.\n\nIn 1937, Andrew Mellon donated the twenty-one paintings, along with the money to build a National Gallery of Art to house them, to the United States Government. The paintings were, and remain, the heart of the National Gallery collection.\n\nOther sales were made in the same period, notably the Codex Siniaticus from the Russian National Library, sold in 1933 to the British Museum (after 1973 British Library) for £100,000 raised by public subscription (worth £ in 2018), and \"The Night Café\" by Vincent van Gogh.\n\nIn the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Parliament of the Russian Federation passed a new law prohibiting the sale of Russian art treasures to foreign countries.\n\nFor many years the National Gallery was reluctant to lend the paintings it had bought from the Hermitage back to that Museum, for fear that the Russian government would keep the paintings in Russia. That policy changed after 1990, when Mikhail Piotrovsky became director of the Hermitage. A number of the National Gallery paintings have been on loan to the Hermitage, including \"Venus with a Mirror\" by Titian, which was lent to the Hermitage at the time of the first visit of the President George W. Bush to St Petersburg in 2002.\n\nFebruary 1928\n\nHermitage ordered to prepare list of paintings for sale.\n\nJanuary 1930\n\n\nMay 1930\n\n\nJune 1930\n\n\nJuly 1930\n\n\nOctober 1930\n\n\nNovember 1930\n\n\nJanuary, 1931\n\n\nFebruary 1931\n\n\nApril 1931\n\n\nFebruary 1932\n\n\n\n"}

The programme bears a striking similarity to an episode of \"Panorama\"; even its theme tune, the fourth movement of Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 1, was the theme tune of \"Panorama\" at the time.\n\nA \"confessor\" (John Cleese) is interviewed about his experience as a mouse: when he was a teenager, he got drunk at a party and experimented with cheese, and gradually came to accept his mouse identity. \"It's not a question of wanting to be a mouse — it just sort of happens to you,\" he tells the interviewer. \"All of a sudden you realize… that's what you want to be.\" The \"programme\" features undercover footage of a \"mouse party\", where Cleese explains that \"there's a big clock in the middle of the room, and about 12:50 you climb up it and then... eventually, it strikes one and you all run down\". He also points out that there's \"a farmer's wife\" present. Then follows a discussion with psychiatrist and conjuror, The Amazing Kargol (Graham Chapman), about what attracts men to the mouse lifestyle. A series of vox pops illustrates societal attitudes towards mice men, and several historical figures who were mice, such as Julius Caesar and Napoleon are shown, \"and, of course Hilaire Belloc,\" is included. The programme also includes footage of men in mouse costumes being led into police stations, newspaper headlines about mouse scandals and mouse rights demonstrations, and photos of \"mouse clubs\".\n\nIn the original version of the sketch broadcast in 1969, Cleese gave out the telephone number of the mouse man as \"01-584 5313\". The number was that of David Frost's production company, which led to a large number of annoying telephone calls to Frost. The sketch was re-edited for the repeat showing in August 1970 to remove this section.\n\nThe deviant way of life explored in \"The Mouse Problem\" is an obvious parody of the secretive lives and social condemnation of gay men in the 1960s, and the sketch itself mimics the film and interview techniques used in serious television documentary exposés on the subject, but also makes reference to transvestism, recreational drug use, orgies and other behaviour considered \"deviant\" by the standards of the late 1960s. Eric Zorn of the \"Chicago Tribune\" notes its similarity to a real 1967 documentary, \"\". Chapman himself, who wrote the sketch, was gay.\n\nMore recently, with a somewhat more literal interpretation, the sketch has come to be seen as a presage of the furry fandom.\n\n"}

It was bought during Art Basel from Münzen und Medaillen, A.G., October 17, 1963. With flat handles decorated with depictions of ivy, and a double layered foot, it qualifies as a type A amphora. Dated circa 510 BCE, it was likely created by a member of the circle of Euthymides in Athens. It is an early example of red-figure pottery which had been invented only ten years previously. It is regarded by scholars as one of the best examples of the vases that influenced artists in Etruria. It is in excellent condition, but lacks an original find-spot. \n\nThis vase consists of two scenes on either side of the vase, separated by a floral border.\n\nSide A shows the tussle between Apollo and Herakles over the Delphic Tripod, a common subject in painted vases. These bronze tripods were used for sacrifices, and were a very common votive offering at Archaic Greek temples; large numbers have been found at Apollo’s important cult site of Delphi, where this legend is set. Herakles is attempting to steal the particular sacred tripod of Delphi after the Pythian oracle refused to tell Herakles how to cure himself of a disease. Apollo attempts to stop Herakles and an argument between the two half-brothers devolves into a wrestling contest. This fight is eventually broken up when the two are separated by one of Zeus’ lightning bolts. \n\nSide A depicts the moment when Apollo first grabs Herakles’ bicep to stop him from absconding with the tripod. With an open mouth, he seems to beseech Herakles to reconsider his actions. Herakles wrenches his arm from Apollo, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. The sacred palm in the middle of the frame serves as a barrier between the two figures and as a marker of the sacred site of Delphi. The words HERAKLEOS, KALOS, and APOLLONOS which mean Herakles, Beautiful, and Apollo respectively.\n\nProfessor Warren G. Moon has noted that the depiction of Herakles silhouette and movement bear similarities to depictions by the Rycroft Painter on black-figure pottery work.\n\nSide B shows a common motif among Archaic pottery - a scuffle between a maenad and a group of satyrs. The ithyphallic satyrs defend themselves from the blows of the maenad’s grape vines as they advance upon her. This composition of this side, with three figures evenly spaced, with varied and expressive poses, is a type adapted by Etruscan artists in their tomb paintings, as well as vases made in Etruria. \n\n\n"}
